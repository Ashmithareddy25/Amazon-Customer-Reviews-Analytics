B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is a great book!  Stephen King does write long books, which intimidated me.  The plot is the typical go back to the past to change something in the future and the consequences, and generally those are not my personal favorite story lines.  Stephen King held me attention for this one, though.  Once the main character goes back to the 1950-1960s, Stephen takes you into what becomes a period drama and I found that interesting.  I grew up in the era surrounding Kennedy's assassination and the huge social changes for minorities and women that followed.  Stephen Kings wonderful research helped the reader go back in time themselves.  The details of driving, advertising, morals, fashion, language, life styles is wonderful.  The tension of time to prevent Kennedy's death is amazing.  Well worth the extra time to get through the book's length.  I just might pick up another Stephen King novel someday!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|A wonderful book that I purchased for my new Kindle that I purchased, but then lost, because even though this is the third kindle I have purchased, 2 are in my wife's name where many purchases were made, which I CAN'T ENJOY UNLESS I BORROW HERS.  The third kindle I had under my name, but I wasn't allowed to have my wife SHARE items she and I had acquired, before we purchased the third kindle. consequently I lost all my purchases I made on the third Kindle, because I switched Proprietorship of the third Kindle to my wife's name so I COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED UNDER THE FIRST TWO KINDLES I PURCHASED, WHICH ARE UNDER MY WIFE'S NAME ! ! !
B004SUWR2C|4.0|We enjoy playing this game as a family and have for years.  Great card game on family vacations. The app words well on the Kindle Fire HD.  Only thing that would make it better:  Keep tally of games played between devices.  We play each other on our Kindle Fires.  The app/game will keep score for one hand but will not keep a tally of hands to finish a game.  Wish they would keep a running tally on hands played with other connected players until the game end, not reset after each current hand.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|A wonderful App that I purchased for my new Kindle that I purchased, but then lost, due to your propriatory rules, because even though this is the third kindle I have purchased, 2 are in my wife's name where many purchases were made, which I CAN'T ENJOY UNLESS I BORROW HERS.  The third kindle I had under my name, but I wasn't allowed to have my wife SHARE items she and I had acquired, before we purchased the third kindle. consequently I lost all my purchases I made on the third Kindle, because I switched Proprietorship of the third Kindle to my wife's name so I COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED UNDER THE FIRST TWO KINDLES I PURCHASED, WHICH ARE UNDER MY WIFE'S NAME ! ! !  I didn't want to purchase EVERYTHING ALL OVER AGAIN !
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like this series, but after watching the first episode I was hooked.  Now I can't wait for Season three too become available.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Like &#34;The Goal&#34; before it, the Phoenix Project conveys the concept of the Theory of Constraints in a well done story format that really drives the concepts home!  Taking ideas and concepts from Agile, Lean, and DevOps, and weaving them into a story that anyone who has worked in or around IT can identify with.  You will be able to really identify with the characters and the situation in this book and gain insights into how these concepts can be turned into actions in your own IT world.  I would highly recommend anyone in the technology space and related business areas read this book (and isn't that most of us these days?)
B0054LJGWS|4.0|This was an engaging book, more so than some of the author's other work. The narrator's voice is quite similar to Douglas Adams' (author of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), with an equal measure of Vonnegut. It's a quick read, which to me is a sign of a good story. Very Postmodern for you literary types. Read it!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Wasted my time and money on this. It was good until the end but what a disappointing ending. Worst ending ever! Don't bother with it.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|My 11 year old grandson made his own bow and arrow one day.  My daughter told him that he had &#34;MacGyver'd&#34; that quite well.  He had never heard of MacGyver so I purchased this for him.  The whole family is enjoying watching these programs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so awesome!  Coal mines are so cool.  Temple Run 2 is very fun.  The characters are really cool. Much beter than Temple Run.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Really cute game. It's addictive to both me and my 3 year old! If you let a child play make sure parental control is on because you can purchase things for this game. Wouldn't want a kid to buy $100 worth of coins without realizing it's real money. You don't have to buy anything to play the game you just are able to IF you want to play faster.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|For the cost of zero, I could read this book on my Kindle with no thought of having to drive to and from the library, having to hurry to finish this long book within a two-week lending period, or even having to hold a large, heavy book, since the Kindle is light to hold, and, actually faster to read (I adjusted the font larger and the reading process flows faster and easier).  I saw the movie, and it was interesting to read the original, complete novel.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|We laughed so hard at parts of this movie & we even cried too.  The message is powerful.  Great for every Dad or anyone who would like to be one some day!  Women will enjoy it too.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|gets you hooked then wants money to finish the game?<br />if it wasn't interesting I'd say it was a rippoff.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Love Cher and Christina in this. The story line is okay but the singing, dancing, and costuming is fantastic.  Some big names in lesser roles make it shine.  Those two ladies can SING!!
B00B0ZT9NI|2.0|The story is fascinating, but the movie wasn't all that great. I was really distracted by Ben Affleck's performance. I get that he was trying to be stoic and serious, but his face literally did not change expression once during the entire film. Can he act? Don't answer that. The rest of the cast was good, but there weren't any stand out performances or particularly memorable scenes. I did like the intro. But, overall this gets a thumbs down.
B005LAII12|5.0|Love that dirty little teddy bear!  See the unrated version for the adult content and the theater version for the &#34;just funny&#34; version.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What can you say, it is John Grisham.  I enjoyed it very much, it was easy to read and kept my attention.
B0060ZJ74O|3.0|Not a great movie - OK at best, but it does follow the book reasonably well. It could be a PG but there is one F-bomb in the whole movie. Why bother?
B009UX2YAC|3.0|IT Un installed its self!!!!!!! I have to Start ALL!!!!!!! over Lost everybody I unlocked and  the limited editions. And it won't let me connect to my Facebook anymore Plz Fix This problem.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A time when manners etiquette and boundaries were important, this era seems more civilized.  I love the costumes, scenery and the story.  We have lost the art of conversation now with computers texting and emails.  It's so nice to be engrossed in a movie that has no vulgar language, high speed car chases and has to rely on the actor's ability to make you feel something.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think my horse is the best game ever!<br />It is very fun.  It is very realistic.  It is the best free kindle fire app.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Our family consists of ages 6-36. Due to the adaptability of this game, we all get a kick out of it. It's easily worth the price (free).
0316069434|3.0|Harry is the same no-nonsense/forego-the-rules-for-the-good-of-the-case cop he always was. Good old Harry!<br /><br />This is an interesting story line leading in many directions most especially because it's a 20 year old cold case murder. Where it leads you'd never guess, but it does take some time to really get going. I could have done without all the L.A. gang related details & information in the first part of the book, it just wasn't necessary. I did a lot of skipping there.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER:<br /><br />Some of the plot feels too `pat' &/or convenient & as you read you have to question how come much of the information was not found out way back when even with the minimum of investigation. At the end questions remain as to how/why Harry's `help' happened to arrive on the scene just in time. It's a loose end that makes no sense.<br /><br />Other than these minor inconsistencies this was an ok story which speeded up towards the end to the anticipated conclusion, but other (earlier) Harry Bosch have been better.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is the third lifeproof case in the family.<br /><br />I like the protection it offers relative to the size. I tried an Otter box and it was too bulky, the rubber made it difficult to get in and out of your pocket compounded by the bulk and it wasn't completely dust or water proof.<br /><br />Frankly, I like the Zagg screen protectors alone if you don't need shock, dust or waterproofing. But in the military and a motorcycle rider, I like my black case. My daughter liked it enough too, so she got this one here. My son also likes his for his iPhone 5.<br /><br />What I don't like is that the docking connection for the iPhone 4 has to match the Apple specs or it won't fit in the space in the case. you can buy an adapter, for actual docking accesories or if your cable has a bigger body than the apple cord. I don't like having to use the headphone dongle for my Shure e215s, but I think the apple headphones will fit in the space without the adapter as long as you don't need the water and dustproofing while they are plugged in.<br /><br />Great case overall as long as you don't mind those conditions for the headphones and charge/sync port.<br /><br />** I didn't realize how much fake cases were an issue, but we extended the warranty on this case through the lifeproof site using the serial numbers so I guess this is just a great price on an authentic lifeproof case**
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Lots of new things to do!  I'm an Angry Birds fan and this was lot of fun! I LOVE IT!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a great game. very well done levels, and it's lots of challenge. I'm looking forward to the quell reflect
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|I just recently became a huge fan of the series, and this movie was amazing. Joss Whedon is a great director.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Another great addition to a great series.  If you have not seen it yet you should it is well worth it.
0345803493|5.0|The story line is great! It isn't the best written, but the story will captivate you. I guarantee it. It's hot!
0470474874|5.0|I have been using Excel for many, many years.  I knew I was only scratching the surface with its capabilities.  This book explains how to increase the utilization of this program to your benefit. This book has saved me time, while making me more organized and productive.
1607050072|4.0|I purchased this book as a beginning sewer and crafter.  This book has a variety of projects at different skill levels and includes directions, pictures, and patterns.  I have already created several projects that are fun to do and not time consuming.  The pictures are bright and cheerful, and I feel the basic designs leave room for expansion and imagination.  As a crafter with Scandinavian heritage, I thought this aspect of the book left some to be desired.  Other than that, it has been a great book to help me practice my sewing skills.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I read this book in 5 days!!!<br />It makes me cry and laugh happy and it makes me feel  so look at my  other option in<br />life..<br />THe author is great...Would recommend it to anyone..<br />Evangeline
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game has the biggest map iv ever seen and to add onto that u can fly so freacking awesome
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|It is even better quality than I though it would be. It has all the orginal shows plus all the movies. If you liked it when it came on tv its a must have.
B0000252YK|5.0|Slowly replacing my 1500 cassettes to disc and ran across this at a bargain. Jake E Lee's best work with the Ozz.
1475143389|5.0|While the principles in this book are not new, they are laid out and explained in a very comprehensive manner. There are several other guys out there who subscribe and teach this philosophy of training who are very experienced reputable as well. Which, to me, just brings more validity to these principles. Anytime someone comes out with something brand new that no one has ever heard of or agrees with, you can almost be sure its a scam. Not the case here. Mr. Matthews really does a great job laying a foundation for exercise and nutrition for ANYONE who would like to take control of their health. I couldn't recommend this book more!
0141439513|5.0|I purchased this for my son's college freshman English class; it arrived promptly ; he read it from cover to cover; and received an &#34;A&#34;.
0765325950|2.0|The story had to end.  But there was little here which I found satisfying in the manner of ending the tale (or many tales).  Very disappointing.
B0054SMID0|5.0|This movie was impeccable !!! definitely  must see. the story line, the actors and everything was really amazing. I always love Matthew as an actor but this was different for him and it was great to see the surprise of how everything happened.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|it had enough moments to want to endure it until the end but not enough to watch it more than once
B0000C3I6U|5.0|listening to arnold talk about the Pump is hilarious.  If you're into some old school inspiration this is a good one to have!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Most people love this (and the other two) book because of the &#34;sex&#34;, but I simply love it because of the love story behind it. It kind of gives girls an unrealistic idea of what men should be like, but it is still a great love story. Now, I'm just patiently waiting for the movies to come out!
B003LPV960|4.0|I bought this item as a gift for my Aunt.  The quality was fine, the packaging was perfect for gift giving.
1554072840|1.0|Although my daughters used this book for potty training, it needs to be updated. Carrying the potty around the house for use - ugh! Book received in a timely fashion and in great condition.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|very funny movie, I thought it would be better to watch it before I watched the 3rd movie so that;s why I decided to buy it.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|sure the movie had action but no real background on bad guy and no special tools for 007  not a good story that is would i say is missing..
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is hilarious and my co worker friend told me about it and i have wanted to see it for so long and it's an hilarious movie.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Not much to say IT'S ELF for crying out loud. Spaghetti and syrup? Why the heck didn't I ever think of that?
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Very interesting follow up to The fall of Giants which focused o n First World War whereas Winter of the World is about the second World War.  A good perspective from the German, Russian and Allies side.  It is very readable and you certainly get caught up in what the various characters are about, and how they are interlinked throughout the narrative.
0062082353|5.0|Very good read. If you like action and true fact than this book will be the book for you. I have enjoyed reading this book and have started reading it for the second time.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|All the songs were great. The styling and sound clarity very nice. Such a great CD to unwind to on the way home from the office.<br />Sherry
141690977X|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book. lt had good information and was fun to read.  The book was written for younger folks.  But, it had some information that could be used by all ages.
B00AATV046|5.0|I usually watch this at Christmas.  Love cary Grant!  It is a little sappy, and the special effects are so outdated they are funny!  It is a classic!
B00164KYV4|3.0|I viewed the movie and was disturbed by how dumb the women were portrayed.  I am hoping that the majority of women do not act and react as the women in the movie.  However, I know there are some immature women.  I just don't want to believe that most of them are. I am not an objective viewer of this movie because I don't enjoy anything that make women look less than intelligent.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I enjoy all of the angry bird games. The easy download to ease of play.  The monkeys are evil though.<br />(:-)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is like this huge collection of glossy magazines that you never have to throw away. You can browse through a variety of subjects all at once, or target a specific interest. You save what you want in your own private collection, all arranged in categories that you choose, and can go back as often as you want to revisit each one. If I have one complaint, it is a small one. There is no button that tells me I already have this item in my collection, so sometimes I end up with the same thing saved a couple of times, but no worries......it's easy to delete any extras. There is ample room to leave your own notes on each &#34;pin&#34;, and you can save things from all over the web, to this site where you can easily find them again! I am a Pinterest junkie, and I love it!!!
B00632HWOG|2.0|because I really never use it, so I cannot really say anything about it, but will check it out again soon.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is the only book that I have ever read twice and probably will read a few more times. A fascinating look into the life of a Navy SEAL part of the most elite military team the US has to offer.  From BUD/S to Bin Laden, we get to see the life path that this particular SEAL followed in order to get to the most important mission in US history.  You will walk away from this book with a deepened respect and admiration for the training, discipline, and sacrifice it takes to become a member of SEAL Team 6 (DEVGRU).  \\"For God and Country...\\"
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great read. Such a good love story on many levels. However I wish Ms Hoover would have not left her friends<br />Breckin and Six, I wish there would have been a better closure with them. I liked the comedic effect they both had. I do love the rest of the book. Very good ending, very good characters. Bravo, Karen! She is an inspiration to women.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good story and well written. Very descriptive sex scenes will not be very everyone. The story line could be deeper.
B007M45PMU|5.0|It usually takes me quite a while to warm-up to new music but not so much with this CD. It only took me three listens to love it and that really is saying quite a bit (It took me like five to fall in love with Arcade Fire's Suburbs).<br /><br /> On the first listen, I really only cared to listen to the radio hits and didn't pay much attention to the other songs. On the second listen, I kinda felt that all of the songs sounded too similar. Finally, on the third try, I gave it the attention it deserved and fell in love. Now, much like I do with all of my music, I have it on constant repeat and am burning it into the ground.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book.I have thought about if if JFK was not killed. I found te book fast moving and hard put book down!

B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I feel like this season of Downton Abbey was rushed through. Why so many 2 hours episodes? Why did they have to kill off the 2 best characters in the show. Sybil's death was bad enough; I know people who cried for days. The thing about Downton that kept it so special was how real the characters are & how attached people became to them. The ending was horrific! I still can't get poor Matthew's face with his eyes open & blood running down out of my head. Not very classy Downton, more like a horror movie. After 2 season's of watching Mary & Matthew squable & flirt, then finally fall in love, this was no way to end the show. I could think of many ways to have written him & Sybil out of the story without killing them. I knew before the season started that Matthew was leaving; which kind of ruined it for me, but i never, ever would have anticipated this. Mary was loveable with Matthew; he brought out the best in Mary. Now is she going to go back to the brazen, sharp tongued bully she was in season one?
B006JD48NM|4.0|this is a decent documentary about one of the great race car drivers.  It has many on and off track highlites, as well a chronology of the rivalry with driver, Alan Prost.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|A great tribute to Whitney with all of my favorite songs. I would recommend it to anyone who wants 1 CD with her greatest hits.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|An intense rush of a soundtrack with incredible rock/techno fusion songs. Think of this like the rock response to Bayonetta's pop.
0061537934|5.0|Garth Stein's &#34;The Art of Racing in the Rain&#34; is a wonderful book.  Have given it as gifts and loaned a copy still not returned.  Bought another!
B004LROUW2|5.0|This is a very good, long book in an easy to use format. It has good procedurals for detectives and far out spiritual ideas.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thank you Amazon for providing me with this show. Absolutely love this show! Love having the new episodes in a timely manner! I can now talk with my coworkers about the show with out them mentioning any spoilers.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|seems just like a real horse and has gregarious obstacle courses I think its awesome but takes a long time to load
B000AP04L0|5.0|It funny how this movie is so accurate about corporate America. It should be used as a training tool for how not to treat employes.
0143117009|4.0|interesting information regarding how societies collapse- we can learn much about preventing future decline/collapses of societies by reading this book
B004DK5CYM|5.0|As a kid I was really into horse racing and the triple crown.  Secretariat was kind of an idol of mine at that time.  When the movie came out I had to see it.  I really liked the character development in the movie and feel it was superbly done.  I still get goosebumps when watching the final race scene even though I know what is going to happen and have now seen the movie a few times.<br /><br />My wife and kids who are not interested in horse racing at all did not want to watch the movie with me, but one family night I was able to convince them to watch it and every one of them were leaning forward during that final race scene and they were cheering as if it were really happening.  After the movie they were asking me questions about if this really happened.  Even my wife was impressed and interested.  My oldest daughter and I went online to show her what &#34;Big Red&#34; really looked like and do a little more research.  It was a nice family bonding experience.<br /><br />If you like horse racing and want to see a wonderful story... you really should see this movie.  If you just want to see a well done feel good movie.... you really should see this movie.  It is one of the best movies I have seen recently and the fact that the events really happened just make it that much better.
1439156816|5.0|i read this book while taking a college writing course- it helped me with my writing, especially knowing that even stephen king has writers block.

B002VRZEYM|4.0|insightful yet frustrating account of where our food comes from.  the only real solution is for everyone to raise/grow their own food.  probably not realistic.
0670451495|5.0|Nothing compares to well - written and beautifully illustrated children's books.  Who needs computer graphics??  Nope.  No need here.  This one is an absolute American classic.  A treasure.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson deftly closed this, the ultimate chapter to a beloved realm.  Boldy standing at someone else's canvas and fearlessly wielding his pen as though it were a sword; he crafts large scale battles, unit-sized skirmishes, and individual sword and source battles with the ability and sense to write what needs to be written without being afraid of what super fans would criticize him for doing.  Using Robert Jordan's notes and guidance from the great beyond, this book is a must read for those of us whom have followed this epic for twenty years.  Way to go Jordan and Sanderson!  I love this tome!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|james bond does not disapoint. a bit slow in the beginning but as all bond movies picks up quickly and the pace keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I really liked this show. The characters are well done and actually seem real in the sense that they react the way I think most people would. Even the bad guy of the group is likeable. It has interesting story-lines. the only down fall is that a couple of episodes had some predictable moments but it still didn't ruin it for me. I can't wait for season 3!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was my favorite book when I was a young girl. Decided to re-read it, and I loved it - again!
B009UWYFFK|4.0|My family and I enjoyed the movie. It was a fun story and the kids laughed and laughed. It was a different concept and and had a good message.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones<br />I chose to read this book as one of my friends had to read a bit for an exam and it sounded really good. My cousin is addicted to it so I knew it must have been good. City of Bones is a book which the pages contain fantasy, adventure, action, love and hate.<br /><br />Since this book contains fantasy and a little bit of magic, some things are just being recycled. Such as vampires, were-wolves, portals and that the 'magic' world is hidden from normal people called mundies.If you've read the Harry Potter series, you'll notice some similarities. The author has been creative though in her own way, such as Shadow-Hunters. They are half human and half angel. They are more attractive than humans, they are fitter and slightly stronger. There are also the forsaken which are basically like zombies.<br /><br />The vampires and were-wolves are the same, hating each other. There always seems that there is a person in charge which a lot people don't like. The characters haven't really met the Clave, who is basically the lord of demons, warlocks, Shadow-Hunters and all the magical species in Manhattan, Brooklyn and New York. The characters are well described but do some things that are out of character. For example, one of the characters, Isabelle, doesn't like the main character, Clary. However, in the middle of the book, she gets along with her. Towards the end it's a bit like Star Wars, if you've seen it, you'll know how the book is similar. The main characters are: Clarissa Fray, Jace Wayland, Alec Lightwood, Isabelle Lightwood, Simon, Luke, Jocelyn, Hodge and the evil villain, Valentine.<br /><br />I liked this story because even though some things have been recycled, I couldn't help but keep on turning the pages. The best part of the book for me was when the characters were at a warlock's party and one of the characters turned into a rat. It was quite hilarious. I would recommend this book to my friends just as I am to you, the readers who have taken the time to read this review. I am currently reading the second book in the series: City of Ashes. This story is like a roller-coaster, one point you might be laughing on the inside and the next you might be about to cry. The author takes you with the characters and makes you feel how they feel.<br /><br />This book is quite good, even though some things have already been used. The story is interesting and exciting to read. There is a little bit of adult content in there, but nothing too serious. Hope this review helps you! :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)<br /><br />Here's the product link: [[ASIN:B0013TXA5Y City of Bones (Mortal Instruments)]]
B009KKLQKO|5.0|Loved the quality,the video, and most of all, the MUSIC.  I went to the concert and the sound quality was great.  My only disappointment, it wasn't the whole concert.  QUESTION??? are they going to bring out part #2 ,to complete what wasn't on this first tape?
B00AFROVQC|5.0|One of my new favorites. I could not stop reading it. I hope the new one is just as good if not better.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Best action movie I've seen in a long time...being a &#34;Super Hero&#34; fan is a plus as well.  If you like action, you'll like this movie.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a unique piece of literature.  It really seemed as though it was a true story and Pi became a real peerson to me.  I giggled every time I read the name Richard Parker.  The way he got his name was very imaginative.  It was a bit too  graphic for me in places, but I realize that those scenes were appropriate for that story.
B009ANP4F4|2.0|I did not enjoy the story line or the dancing in this version. I did enjoy Step Up 3 much better.
034580404X|5.0|A great read at a great price.  I got this in just a couple of days and couldn't put it down once I started reading it.
B0050PYNOY|1.0|This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  With Natalie Portman and James Franco, I thought the movie had promise so I didn't walk out in the first five minues.  I am embarassed that I didn't walk out at all.  I hope Natalie and James were paid huge money for the damage this movie should do to their careers.  This could only appeal to a very sick 12 year old, who should never be allowed to see it.
0393343405|5.0|The best book I've read this year. beautifully written, though more detail on the life of Poggio than I needed. Still, his life establishes the times in which he lived, one marred by incredible venality, corruption and greed within highest levels of the Roman Catholic church. The absolutely astonishing fact, at the center of the book, is that the idea that we would today loosely call atomic theory and the nature of matter, always changeable, was laid out in epic poetry by a pagan philosopher/poet about 50 B.C.E. One could reasonably argue that his Roman poet, drawing probably on still older Greek ideas, created a modern secular world ... one violently opposed by the Roman Catholic church, where heresy could lead one to be burned at the stake ... and often did.<br /><br />The stories of Bruno and Copernicus and Galileo are well known and briefly surveyed within. But the trenchant center of this book is the triumph of reason over superstition ... a battle that continues. 'Tis a remarkable, remarkable story, well told. Buy it! You'll quickly see why it won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a fun game when it loads properly.  my girls love horses but cant have a real one so this is great for them.
B009YQJ322|1.0|Wow!  If you want to know how to skin a human being, this is the movie to watch.  No wonder Carl Urban refused to show his face.  This movie is sick.  If you enjoy torture, then go for it.  Personally, I wouldn't recommend this movie for any amount.<br />Doc
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|I'm a bruce willis fan and with an all star cast how could i go wrong. I just bought it without ever seeing it before and have enjoyed it fully.
0143034901|5.0|Truly a great piece of literature! Novel has deep thought thought on life and man as shown through the wonderful characters. Drawn like a great piece of art!  Just grows and expands and turns in and around itself.  Can't wait to read the rest!
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I just love sci-fi and i wanted this movie for my collection. I see it time and again and its no golden globe but i was very pleased with it and the price was better than Walmart
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I only chose this because of Denzel Washington . What a surprise!  Great! Not just crashing airplanes but human psychology.  Highly recommend!
B000002LFZ|5.0|CD is great.<br />New and clean and in perfect condition.<br />I highly recommend it.<br />Sound system is very good you wont regret buying this CD.
034580404X|5.0|Fantastic deal of the day price, I couldn't put the book down.  Recommend for all women, and men who want insight on how to make a woman feel extra special.  lol
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I finished this book in about a day and a half and I really enjoyed it.  I was a little slow to jump on the bandwagon because I wasn't sure that I would want to read about all of their sexual encounters. Although I am not a fan of the S&M, dom and sub type of situation, I still enjoyed reading this book.  With all of that aside, this is your classic Cinderella story and I enjoy that.  One downside was that this book was a little repetitive and that became annoying about half way through the book,but if I'm not mistaken, this was this authors first book, so I can look past that.  Just a heads up, the repetition didn't get any better in the following two books. All in all, this was a good read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is almost better than temple run! PLAY THIS GAME!! If u don't play... your missing out. Everyone in my house play it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I felt that while the first and second books kinda flowed from day to day in the lives of Chrisitan and Ana, this book did a lot of jumping around and I felt that this book was rushed.  With that being said, I still enjoyed reading this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my Sorrel loves her style and I love feeding her! competitions are so fun and I like the different horses to buy! I highly recommend this game to everyone!!! ;)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am a sucker for a good Cinderella story and this is what that was, but with a twist.  If you can get past all of the repetition and the S&M then its a good book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Not the ending I was expecting. I couldn't stop reading and did not want the book to end. Love Sparks and all of his work.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I've tried a few hidden object games on kindle, and this is my favorite.  So far I haven't had any problems with it.
B004I744AS|5.0|Most of the dictionary functions in the Kindle Fire only allow you to easily look up words AS YOU COME TO THEM IN A BOOK. You hold your stylus down on the word and up pops the definition.  But what if you just want to look up a random word?  There is no where in those apps to just type in a word and get the definition. You can use the &#34;Go To&#34; function but you can't enter the word, you have to estimate the &#34;location&#34;, not very user friendly.  This app is so much easier to use because of that.  This free version has some ads in it that the paid for version doesn't have but I don't think it's that big of a deal.
0553801473|5.0|I liked the pace. It also continues the same style as before. Overall its a good book as it elaborates more on the other characters that were not mentioned very much in the previous book. I like it a lot!
B004IYISSK|5.0|This was such a wonderful book to read with great history of the country and the uprising that these women had to go through. I could not put this book down.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The creativity this story possesses, and the way King makes the impossible so believable is brilliant. What a fantastic novel! Beautifully written characters with whom you fall in love. Kings ability to write as if these people actually exist left me speechless. Perfectly paced. And perfectly told. A perfect mix of realism and fiction...what a great story.
B004GVUPFE|1.0|you get no where fast.  the only benefit was that it was a free down load, that you didn't mind deleting fast
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't say I saw it coming but I had some thought of disaster in mind. Katness or katniss not sure how to spell it to be honest even though I've seen the same name over 100 times, will loose her mind. To confirm this thought I'm also reading mocking Jay hoping it leaves the capitals fire burning out. Hope for the best but in their circumstances that actually might not happen. Kiss those three fingers and hold them up!
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's too hard to set off the TNT.  The only reason I bought this game was because of the TNT.
B002BCNK1Q|4.0|I wish I had the half star option, then I would rate the movie 4 1/2 stars. The movie was great. It confronted and demonstrated many concepts of prejudice and intercultural communication and compelled much self-reflection in me as a viewer. As far as plot, not much was cliche', and that is a big plus for me. Movies that I can easily anticipate eventually lose the little entertainment they had. But everything I expected Walt or the Hmong family to do didn't happen and that kept my eyes glued. What keeps me from rewarding the movie a full 5 stars is simply the gang action, or better the lack of it. There was a constant mention of gangs in the movie, primarily referring to that of Thao's cousin, but not much to demonstrate the gang activity of each group. This isn't really a big deal, and might be best that it wasn't added, but it's just something minor that sits with me. Also, it was sort of implied that Walt had left the neighborhood at some point and returned 3 years later. However, it was not very clear as to why he was gone for 3 years. I would like to think it was for military duties, but am not very sure. Lastly, Walt apparently loved his wife very much, but there was no depiction of that love. Perhaps an initial flashback in the beginning of the film (or wherever appropriate) or a testimony from someone who knew the couple well. Besides those three issues I really enjoyed the film and would recommend it to nearly everyone I know.
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|While being dark, and I mean as in low lighting, is part of any horror movie, there are some that are just SO dark, you can't see what's going on.  This is one of them. The majority of the film is without light, to the point the creep factor just goes out the window.  In fact, I just wanted to give up watching completely I became so annoyed.  Also, the soundtrack is terrible.  It sounds like a 1980's punk garage band.  I saw elements of The Ring, and &#34;Mr. Boogie&#34; is nothing more than someone's version of Heath Ledger's Joker.  Poor acting, especially by whomever played the wife.  I will say, there was one shining jewel in the movie and that was the far too brief appearance of Vincent D'Onofrio.  I saw him in the trailer which was what prompted me to rent this movie in the first place.  I was suckered.  Hope you will not be.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Up to his usual standards, going back to his original character.  His other newer character has been a bit harder to fill out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One doesn't inhale this book simply because it is easy to read, although it is very easy to read.  It is intriguing, captivating, and solid to the end.  And the end.....oh my!
B00943SQCI|4.0|Always quirky and so fun to watch.  From the previews, I thought that this was going to be a comedy, but after watching it, realized that it is not a comedy so much as a dramedy.  It was much better than I had expected after reading some other reviews.
0765325950|5.0|Awesome book. Sanderson does a really good job. There were some plot lines that didn't get resolved, but that's OK. With so many it would have taken another book. I highly advise investment into this series.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|I like the premise that Snow White was not just some helpless twit, but someone capable of defending and motivating those around her.  I thought that the movie was well made and had very good special effects.  The acting was excellent, even for Kristen Stewart, who in other roles, I didn't feel she had to stretch too much.
B008220D5K|5.0|Watched this with my girl friends.. we laughed our behinds off!!  I am waiting patiently to buy this on DVD and I dont buy movies other than Disney for my kids.  Funny, real.. hilarious.  Cannot wait to own it.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I could have done without the curse words in a couple of the songs.  They were not necessary as the music stands all on its own.
0061537969|5.0|So well written, anyone that has or has had man's best friend in their lives will deeply relate to this wonderful book. I even learned a few life lessons from this beloved soul.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This move was amazing. I was late to the party seeing it. The amazon digital delivery was high quality and looked super sharp on my TV.
0553582038|4.0|I was glad to save a few dollars by getting this used copy. It got here quickly. However, it's not my favorite book of the series.
B00AG472DS|4.0|A SICK GUY MADE FAMOUS BY THE PRESS.  STILL AN ACUATE RETELLING OF THE REAL STORY, AS FAR AS I KNOW.
0553381695|5.0|Loved this series an was glad to have a chance to get it used. It was in good condition and I was albe to pass it on.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|I am a pilot. I thought the story about a man trying to land an airliner while drunk and saving all those on board while performing crazy maneuvers while drunk was going to be intriguing to say the least. I was horrified to find out that in the first 5 minutes of the movie, he was not only drunk, but high, and was just not a very good person at all. Real pilots are not like this, and if they are, they don't fly ATP. Too add insult to injury, Amazon charged me $10 for returning a movie I only watched for 5 minutes before turning it off. Their return service is understandably protecting them for customers who ruin items in the first 30 days, then want to get a refund, but they got a disk back that is brand new. I do not recommend this movie, and do not recommend returns by Amazon.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Very disappointing. They went with easy humor. Might be funny for teenagers but not for adults. I thought the movie was boring.
030758836X|3.0|This book had the potentials to be a great thriller: the carefully developed characters and how they unfolded, the twists, the build-ups, but it seems like the author could not harness the great work she created. The last few chapters dragged on. An expectation of at least something interesting would happen in the end did not materialize. Disappointing ending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's almost like I'm really taking care of a horse. You feed it care for it and take it to championships. Awesome game
B0082FPIY8|5.0|Really enjoyed this memoir from Sheryl Stayed! Get it today and enjoy! I could really visualise the Pacific Crest Trail and would now love to hike it myself someday. This book is the author's own personal journey through grief and loss, a process many will relate to.
B000GIXLO8|2.0|This seemed like a great deal but alas, the discs skip every few minutes when I play them, both in my computer's player and my DVD player.  It's worth it to just buy the official DVD that costs around $25.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I was told about this book by a friend. I'm more of a space scify guy as opposed to virtual reality sci ft but this was awesome. It had everything I look for. Aliens, spaceships, battles, mystery, suspense and key characters that worked well together.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME!But just I don't like that you can't explode a Tnt.It's so worth 6 dollars and 99 cents.Once I made a giant creeper and a giant seires 2 Wrecking Ball.
B000W93CXQ|3.0|Something about this book I didn't like. But for the most part it was great. It really inspires you to talk to the people you love and not ignore signs.
6304712944|5.0|This production is the best of all the performances offered on  DVDs .Though this is an old one, the<br />stars are at their peek .
B00B2V66VS|1.0|it Sucks. it was fun but it wont open and when I uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it...I cant
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Starts rather slowly, almost as if compiling a resume to justify its existence. Reaches a resounding second wind going through the mid 90's. Dies with a tear in your eye. Resurrects as a phoenix, with fire. A+  to Dave Grohl for saving a piece of history, music irregardless.
B008LFY6NI|5.0|coolest art app ever. i recomend you buy the full version cuz the free one doesnt have all the features.
B004T5R2HQ|3.0|I have used this successfully quite often however I have noticed that recently it has failed to work for me after the trimming process. This problem exists across multiple devices in the same manner.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Well, you see after afew weeks after I had gotten this app, strange things started to happen.First it was when the screen froze, and now its not loading AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book is in the vein of &#34;Ellen Foster&#34; which recounts the emotional trials and results of a young woman raised in foster care.  The author's device of using &#34;the language of flowers&#34; to communicate someones feelings with others in a type of secret code is very effective.  It's a nice read.
1416583432|4.0|True to an ivy league grad-writer though, it is talky-talky-talky-talky with lots of 'and check out my vocabulary...!' Book is slow with tidbits here and there, then has a good final-third.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am left dying to read the third book! Suzanne Collins is a great author!  An easy and great read leaves you wanting more!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was an awesome book. I can't wait till your next book. Your books are inspiring me to write books when I grow up.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Really fun and addicting game :) but it could afford to have a fast forward button. I definitely recommend it for passing the time.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this was great. u loved it it helps you make colouges and gloss up your pics this app is grate you should get it
B00881VLCE|5.0|Oh this is a perfect game for people who love doing puzzles, I enjoyed it so much I told a co-worker about it and she had it added to her tablet as well.
0679805273|3.0|There was a slight crease in the pages....like the book had gotten wet or something. I found that pretty disappointing.,
B001APJYMY|5.0|It is time to relax 'Nuff said ... ... ... ... ... .. ... ... ... ... .. . .. .. .. . . . . . . . . . .
B000YJ54DU|4.0|As good of the previous 11..  I started with number 1 a few months ago, and haven't been able to stop..I'm not looking forward to running out..Mr Childs needs to write faster
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app very good graphics. This game keeps you on tour toes and very alert at all times. I would recommend it to all my friends.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, this book keeps your attention from the first paragraph to the last.  I have been a fan of Grisham for many years and his books never fail.
1577314808|5.0|the book arrived earlier than projected and was in better shape than stated. happy all around purchase. very easy to purchase
B00ANW33CM|1.0|I did not like the game.  In fact, I deleted it from my kindle.  I would not recommend it at all.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Mindless entertainment. I love it and have everyone who picks up my kindle fire playing. It definitley gets a five star rating from my family. Thank you
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is good I just want to be able to search for the word and not have to go thorough every page trying to find one word I can find way faster on my laptop buy going on Google
030758836X|2.0|I didn't like it at all.  It gave me the impression that the author was trying to please the &#34;new&#34; generation of readers used to cursing that could have been done without.  The story is good but the way she presents it is not.
020530902X|5.0|it come very quickly. it's a small but very useful book for everyone learning English writing, especially non native speakers.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It was too involved for me. I could not keep all the characters with their Italian names apart. But that was just me . If I read book set in Italy should except it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I really liked the suspense. I wanted to keep reading and not stop. The ending was somewhat not that I was expecting.
B00633W614|5.0|I could not put this book down. As soon as I was finished I got the 2nd story. Will read them all.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Took me two days to read the book and had me reeled in the whole time.  Simply the most amazing book I've ever read.

Ps I'm herobrine
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Great stuff on this album.<br />It's heavy, it has the kind of solos you would want to hear, the rhythm guitars sound amazing.<br />The overall sound is awesome. Plus, it's just great that Chris Broderick is in the band.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Megadeth albums. The only thing I could maybe ask for here is<br />longer solos, the more the better.<br />4.5/5
B000002B35|5.0|I am absolutely pleased with your product the de livery was on time and I enjoyed it to the fullest
B0091REZMW|4.0|Cool game. Never gets bored. Graphics OK depend on device u use. Fun game until u have to pay. Thanks!
0553801473|3.0|Though I have enjoyed the series. I find the last 2 books tedious. I also can't understand the point of killing off all the good characters. I want to believe this has been just a buildup for something better. I hope that the next installment will pull the whole thing back together again for a great conclusion.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this is a great game and the perfect sequel to temple run. I love this game. I reccomend this game to everyone.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really liked this book. Great narrative and extremely well written. I tore through this in 2 days because I just couldn't stop reading it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this app is so fun and awesome its just so fun that I will spend SO MUCH time on it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was so bored with Casino Royale that I did't even see Quantum of Solace.<br />So when we've been invited to the preview of Skyfall, I was sceptic.<br />Even though I saw it in French, Skyfall was brilliant.<br />Bond is elegant as ever!<br />No stupid gadgets, no useless stuff, just the essentials. So classy!
0375703764|1.0|A couple of my coworkers went on and on about how amazing and terrifying this book was, so I was super excited to read it. The story of Johnny Truant was the most interesting part for me. The story of the house itself was overly illustrative which bored me half to death. Then, it  just seemed to end. I was super disappointed.
B000056BOR|5.0|Thanks for having it in your inventory so I didn't have to search the web for a very long time
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not your typical Grisham. I Had it all figured out about half way through,but it was still an enjoyable read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|-its the best app in the world. I love how it looks so real and tht u can pet, feed, treat, and flea. up after your horse
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS SO MUCH I PLAY IT ALL THE TIME!!! IT'S MY FAVERIT GAME!!! Please review it for<br />  *****!<br /><br />A review from my 7 year old daughter!
B006SAR6P8|5.0|The \\"Kill Bill\\" volumes are in a class by themselves. I only purchase films that I want a great unused copy of so I may enjoy it at the moment, like now I have to go and pick one out.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Read this for book club. My favortie book so far. You will enjoy it! Great vacation book. Quick read. Enjoy
B00992CF6W|1.0|Like the title says, Multiplayer doesn't work when using 2nd gen fire's. It is a known issue with Majong but it is not resolved as of writing this. Fix and this app is easily 5 stars.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Scary story! What a psycho. Intense reading. Just unbeleivable. You will enjoy it. Not the fastest read in the world for me
B0061S0A64|5.0|very fun music maker almost unlimited ways to make music would recommend A + + +  + + + +
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this book, had my attention the whole time. Would recommend this book to anyone with passion for adventure.
B000SEGHT6|5.0|No one, no one can write like KV.  He has a profound ability to write with levity and interject life and substance.  His style is unmatched, unparalleled.
B009K86D86|5.0|Makes you think. Backs up some wild claims. Another reason illegal immigration will never go away as long as corporations need cheap labor.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing! It is really fun just like temple run brave and temple run regular. I love that you can slide down ropes and go to the cart level
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. It just keeps you reading and reading. I wish it went on longer. I would recommend it to anyone.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Ries provides lots of examples and stories to back up the punch line of his book. If you don't need to be sold, or don't need to sell the idea, then you can skim that and just follow the tables and intro/closing paragraphs.<br /><br />His approach boils down to using rapid prototyping / agile development to make constant, iterative market tests in situations where the market is very new or unknown. The audience includes business R&D units in established companies tasked with making breakthrough products. He lists a few measures that should be used to gauge performance in these situations and then gives hints on forming an organizational culture in which this process is self-sustaining.<br /><br />Actionable and therefore useful, once you identify relevant growth model and then performance measures for your situation.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|It took a little longer for this second in the series to get moving.  It wasn't until about half way through that there was actually a plot direction and then things moved quickly to what I hope will be acceptable resolutions in the last book of the series.
1439152802|5.0|&#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; is Ms. Morton's 4th novel.  If you appreciate an excellent author, wonderful characterizations, fantastic weaving throughout a story, and one of those novels that you want to never end, read this one.  My reviews are not intended to be &#34;book reports&#34; that tell about the story - that information is available with every book.  My goal is to entice a reader to read books they won't forget!!  &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; is a Keeper!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Awesome. That is by only word that describes it. You get to by gadgets and cool outfits but beware once you get hooked this is the only game you will be able to play!!!:P
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Loud, fun!, and creative. They are a great band and I listen to this everyday! Their songs are catchy, creative and subtle.
B001684L0A|5.0|Nothing has made me appreciate the American Revolution as much as this mini series. It also turned out to make for a great history lesson, as I found myself researching, reading, and learning what actually happened through out the series, for each episode.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Manly. This movie has guns, death, violence, tears, and even a small love story with the HOTTEST guy in the movie!!! Girls, you will love this movie, too, for two words...Jason Stathom.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Keeps you guessing right to the end! Couldn't put it down. My kind of mystery -- no blood or gore!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Makes me want to be from England. No, I'm kidding, but this CD is great. It's folksy, but has just the right amount of rock to make you sway.
B000092WD8|1.0|It was an international version of the dvd and would not play in my player had to send it back and get a refund. Lookout for that
B001DPHDCY|5.0|So cute! I bought this for my son, and he never took his little eyes away from it. It's real family friendly, and so darn cute!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I love all of Denzel Washington's movies.  He is an excellent actor in every sense of the word.  There was a part when he and the heroin girl were hooking up, that I thought this should be a made for TV movie.  Then the movie took off, as Denzel battled with the demon of alcohol.  During the board hearing, Denzel's character could not continue the lies.  This was the scene when he first admits that he is an alcoholic.  This scene and the hotel room scene was more than worth the money.  Beast of the southern wild will dominate the academy so I would be surprised if Denzel's movie even gets a mention.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Fast paced and exciting who done it. Love all of Michael Connelly's books. Fun to learn what life was like for Harry Bosch when he was with LAPD
B008J34466|5.0|I have always loved P!nk and own every one of her CD's. This has a lot of great songs on it. If you love P!nk, highly recommended!

B009MCRHH6|2.0|My kids and I had a hard time with this app.  It seems as there are not enough directions, we are always confused when starting a new level...
B0000A1HQP|5.0|I adore this film - and have watched it many times.  The American version, Dinner for Schmucks, missed the essence of this original film and bastardized a truly funny piece of art.  I can watch this again and again - so funny, and so well written.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|The Star Wars version is better.  I am stuck on one level and have been for like a month, Wish moving the phone would give the fallen birds that little extra push to roll this way or that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Someone casually mentioned this book to me.  I love mysteries and have a list of authors i read routinely.  I was between books so I decided to order Girl Gone: A novel, and I am so glad I did.  I couldn't put it down.  So much more than just a mystery.  It got me thinking about people.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|My kids love this app.  It unfortunately gets old and unused after the Holidays.  That is okay, when Christmas rolls around this year we will be using it again :)
B00ANY7V8M|5.0|my daughters are into playing with legos (ages 8 & 12). this is a very cute set that is hard to find in stores. she loved it.
B0086700CM|3.0|Its like I am stuck on the same distance.  I am not impressed.... my kids love this game though, and I have to admit that I love how you can roll the phone to move him L and R.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|It a great book I love too have it in my life<br />And in my home too for me and my family
B00899F0G8|5.0|One of the best shows on TV, acting, story line, it keeps you wanting more..!!<br />I hope you keep it going..!!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I saw the movie and loved it and then bought the book to fill in any details.  It was a disappointment because it was so different from the movie and didn't really tie things together as well.  Perhaps if I would have read the book first, I would have felt differently.  It was interesting to read from the main character's perspective, though.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I chose this rating more because I was expecting so much more rather than it was that bad.<br /><br />I just felt that after the crash sequence the plot rolled on and on like a boat on a calm sea (not even rolling).<br /><br />It went into the trials and tribulations of substance addiction, but that was really all it was and it was not like Castaway of Gump etc.<br /><br />Ah well, perhaps you really have to be in the right frame of mind for this movie. I don't normally write a review, but I felt so inclined based on my disappointment.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|I liked this dvd because of the actors portraying various parts, especially Hugh Grant and Toni Collette.  Although the boy was seeking a father in the boyfriends that his mother dated, he was disappointed many times, until the Hugh Grant character appeared on the scene.  Even though the Grant character enjoyed the boy and spent time with him, he wasn't very fond of the boy's mother played by Toni Collette.  How this all evolved is the core of the story, so I won't say more about it.  It's a situation too many children experience without a perfect solution.  A.M. Seidler
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It made me think like I haven't in a very long time. I hope everyone gets a chance to read this.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|I kept waiting for the movie to become riveting, nail-biting, thrilling or at least interesting, but it never happened.  I sat through the crude language, a few minutes of supposed fancy flying from an arrogant drunk, and everything went downhill from there...unless you find the human tragedy of alcoholism and addiction entertaining.
B004SBQALA|4.0|I have watched this movie twice since getting it and each time I enjoy it more.  I do hope they make or have made a second movie to go with it.  Lot's of action and fun.  The characters are likable and well played by the actors.  I highly recommend this one!
B0034G4P80|5.0|What an action packed film! Well cast and written too. And Chris Hemsworth, what a hunk! he is perfect as Thor! Loved him in the Avengers too.
B009NCM248|5.0|This CD is the best metal/hard rock album I've heard in a decade. Trying to steer rock music back in the right direction. \m/

1616550414|5.0|As the title says, I'm overjoyed and have waited so long for this book.  I've read some of the other reviews, so I'll address a common issue:<br />  -Yes, the first portion of the book deals mainly with Skyward Sword.  Some people found this much attention unfair to the other games.  It didn't bother me - the art is beautiful and some of the behind the scenes is really interesting.<br /><br />I won't give anything away about the Time line, only to say that it blew my MIND.  I think I understand now why the powers that be withheld an official time line for so long - what a job that must of been piecing all the games together.  I was slack-jawed in awe as I read through it, stopping only to put my brain back together from moments of long-awaited clarity.  AMAZING.<br /><br />The conceptual art was a joy to look through and the manga at the end left me amazed and speechless once again - actually, it was the FIRST thing I read, not having the patience to wait any longer for it.  The dynamic duo that makes up Akira Himekawa does not disappoint and gives us, perhaps, the edgiest version of Link I've yet seen.  They give us an entire story in a mere 32 beautifully rendered pages.  Exceptional and I can only hope that they're busy working on another Zelda Manga for us.<br /><br />Only one little problem marred the experience of this book - I'm not sure if it's JUST my copy or if this was an overall printing problem.  The forward in the beginning by Miamoto is VERY blurred, as if you had double vision - the print overlaps itself, making it very hard to read, almost painful.  HOWEVER - this is the ONLY part afflicted with this issue, and who reads forwards, anyways? (just kidding)  I was too excited to get to the meat of the book to be concerned with this printing issue and it's not something that would cause me to return this book.<br /><br />This is a book I will revisit time and again and cherish forever.  ^_______^
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I didn't have high expectations going into this book. After the last page I was  amazed! The mystery that is the circus comes to life and the love story is  true. I'll be wearing my red scarf!
B009ZQGNPQ|3.0|Everything was going really well in Series III, particularly the moving scene where Jimmy checks up on Mr. Barrow, who took a beating for him. Everyone was more kindly than usual, and then...BANG!... jubilant new dad Matthew geta run off the road by a delivery truck and lies, thrown from his open car, down a ravine, eyes wide open and blood coursing down his temple. Mr. Fellowes, you have created one of the greatest drama series in television history, why in hell would you kill off one of the most beloved characters just to introduce a 20-year-old  mindless flapper (Rose)? While your wife (Ms. McGovern) is a fine actress, your script fails to use her for anything other than bland reactions to family crises. You would have done well to kill her off and leave Matthew to captain the family. TOO LATE! I, for one, will not be seeing any subsequent episodes. You get a D- for bad judgment.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|To be fair, there are some cringe worthy moments in this book as far as dialogue goes. That said, the more I think of these instances (and I'm mainly referring to a conversation early in the story) the more I realize that they make perfect sense and are very realistic, I just don't like reading something that feels juvenile or ripped from an internet message board. In context though, I don't know how it could have been written better. That's the only reason I knocked off a star, because I personally did not enjoy some of the dialogue though it was appropriate for the characters in question.<br /><br />I was surprised by this book. I thought I would enjoy it, but I was shocked at the outcome. When the book began my chief complaint was that the author was spending too much time getting us up to speed with the world he had created and that some of the description became redundant. As I read further I found that I could not put the book down and stayed up late into the night until I had devoured the whole damn thing. Since reading it, I've been wanting to go back and read it again. Yes, it is geeky wish fulfillment in it's most purely distilled form, and I couldn't ask for more. I realize now that some of the concern I had for the time spent building the universe was because it was a universe I already knew. As soon as I understood the premise, I understood the OASIS. Many readers, however, will not have the same ease and will require the additional explanation. All in all, the more I think about my experience reading this book, the more I like it and want to read it again, preferably for the first time. Then again, we can never beat Adventure for the first time again either, can we. By the way, that was my FAVORITE Atari game when I was a kid and I was tickled to see it hold such a prominent role.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|there are a whole lot more twists and turns in the second version.I did not expect this at all.its totally cool
1558908846|4.0|gotta love stallone...I got this after watching the new Judge Dredd and this one is wayyyy much better than the new one.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its really tu. I like it bkahbs hsbsv avhshsh Sgt ssggs. Sgt Sgt ev egg wvv wvvw g he ge.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|what a prelude to Expendables 1....I loved both movies but cannot decide which one I like the best....Over all cast is awesome
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Good, fun reading with enough twists and turns to keep you wondering. Lee Child's Reacher series is great fun. I recommend his books for anyone who likes the genre and it is a unique twist on a murder mystery series.
B002ZG999U|5.0|what can I say awesome movie...lotsa good actors in it .I liked everything about this movie.....only that Steve Austin should have been on the other side......
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoyed this book and began to feel a fondness for Harry Bosch. I was intrigued by the idea that the case was so old and how he began putting things together. The end, however, seemed almost anti-climatic because I had imagined the secret for which the journalist was killed would involve some huge government cover-up of war crimes so I was unprepared for the truth. (Which was ugly but unfortunately considering current news stories, not a rarity and frequently unpunished or minimally unpunished.) It was difficult for me to understand why his superiors seemed so against him - but perhaps the root of that lies in prior novels (this is the first Harry Bosch story I've ever read).
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|this is a great one.I love all the men in black movies and this one just blew me away. awesome job
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love his easily this app can be accessed. It's far easier to use than the Kindle's battery meter. My old Kindle was having a problem with the charger port,  where the meter would indicate it was charging when it really wasn't. With Battery HD enabled, I was able to better tell if my Kindle was charging rather than plugging it in half the day, only to find it hadn't charged a bit.<br /><br />The other functions, while I rarely use them, are still extremely helpful. I especially like being able to check battery health and also knowing how long I have to read, surf the net, or play videos for each percentage the device is charged. The free version has ads at the bottom of the screen, but it's so small and unobtrusive that it's no bother at all.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great product. Highly recommended.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Great movie for racing fans. The 2 disc set arrived fast.<br />Excellent sound & audio quality. Fully satisfied customer.<br />Thanks you!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|wonderful environment lots of puzzles I really enjoyed this game. I was completely taken in by this game the difficultly was adjustable and the puzzles were as challenging as you wanted it to be depending on the difficultly you chose.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I haven't got in to the special effects but as always, blu-ray dvd's look amazing on a 1080p 120Hz+ tv.  If you're watching on anything less you're not getting the most out of them.
096798467X|5.0|If a fourth grade class can build an outdoor oven so can we.  This is not a slickly laid out book, but it makes all the points you need to successfully build an oven than suits your needs. I came across many articles and YouTube videos on oven building that only confused me because they didn't tell me the differences between oven types and how to choose the right style for your needs.  This one did that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun. It's just like Temple Run except even better than Temple Run! I would think it's fun for children of ALL ages!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|i was worried at first about this movie and the damage it might cause to the original series/movies.  however, i was thrilled to discover the film simply helps the overall character developments and story lines.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|An animation based off of one of the timeless works of the Dark Knight. It carries the first part of the book very well. The animation is better than alot of the animated movies DC has put out recently. It's true to the voice material and the voice acting is superb as well. a must rent at the very least if you can't own it yet. However as with part two this is not something for children.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|this is one of my 'go to' movies when i need to take my 'mind off things'.  it never fails me in that regard.
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|to the source material. Just like part one. Part two however is more graphic. There are a couple parts I don't remember from the book and don't make since. There are more parts however that make more sense watching them in action. The animation is top notch. There's alot of animated blood in some parts. Which is to be expected. I do love how they give a little more emphasis to Batmans armor for &#34;the fight&#34;. Again this is not something you want a child watching however. But excellent over all.
030758836X|4.0|I was very curious to read \\"Gone Girl\\" after seeing all the hype and also seeing that it was a genre that I love (that doesn't happen often.)  It was easy to follow but not an \\"easy read.\\"  Very interesting story and I loved the plot twist.  I wasn't thrilled by the ending but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Less answers than you would expect. While I was hoping this would give more insight to the aliens as a whole, and to the history of the aliens universe. It leaves more questions than answers and for it to fit perfectly into the aliens universe there has to be a part two. There's no question about that. Even though it's a (first half it seems) prequel it left far more questions than answers. Did it answer what the aliens are, yes. Did it answer how they got to their current form? no and when you compare face huggers you'll know that it has a long way to go. Overall it was ok. But I was satisfied with one watch of it.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Works well as a simple calculator, and for scientific calculations.  I need ten more words so here they are fred.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|but good fun all the same. I must admit. I'm a fan of material where the writer learns history. Then makes an alternative past. These are usually the works that test my knowledge of what actually happened and intrigue me to find out if it's a piece of history I didn't know. This was a piece of history I know and the rework was just as interesting for entertainment as what actually happened was for knowledge. A good solid piece that I enjoyed watching multiple times. My only complaint is it felt short in the end. I wanted to see more of what was going on and more of what happened before hand. But I was satisfied overall.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|It was a stocking stuffer for my Wife and she will probably wear it out. This Band deserves all the success in the world.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|The meeter seems to do everything it's supposed to do, I must say it is well worth every cent I paid for it.
1616550414|5.0|Excellent, nice book. My girlfriend will love me forever for this Valentine's gift. I'd love to have more of these in many games. Highly recommended for gamers and true Zelda fans.
B009GCF3Q4|2.0|I have read every Michael Connelly book and rate him as my favourite author. However, this is not the best. I read the other reviews and thought, how bad can it be? I agree with the other reviews. It is not worth buying.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best shows (if not the best) on tv right now.  Do not begin the series in the middle though if you haven't started watching it, you must begin with season 1 episode 1 or you will be lost.
B000WPDCTE|5.0|Le Diner De Cons is a wonderfully funny movie and a hit if you like French films! C'est le manifique!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This movie is so good and I wasn't sure it would be because Matt Damon isn't in it.  I wasn't sure the series could be the same without him but it was great.
B009ME47H2|4.0|I use this to record my class lectures.  It allows over 95 hours of recording for free.  It tracks the date and time of the recording and you're able to rename the file.  The only downfall is you can't email files over 5MB.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Yuck.  Dark Knight is right, it was dark.  The only good part is that Katie Holmes wasn't in it.  Tom Hardy was great though.
B005HSL626|5.0|HATE that you have to keep connecting to Amazon to show ads and that it is NOT mentioned clearly that you have to do so every few days!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|OMG!!!!  This is soooooo funny.  You have to see this movie, but it is really crude.  So, if you are easily offended by smutty teddy bears don't watch it.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I think his app is just like temple run bu to me it is even better. the effects and the way you only have to tap the screen. I just wish you could earn fish faster.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is awesome and I would recommend it to anybody. Although there are some things that need fixed it is a really good game. Some times when you want to jump it thinks that you want to turn. For a free game it is definitely worth the gigabits.
B00A0NOF7G|5.0|I enjoyed every moment reading this book.  Lexie gives you a twist and turn and some wonderment and the grannies are beginning to be really good sleuths via their ipads and internet.  It's hard to put these down.  Summer is coming.  Buy them all and read them by the pool or on the beach.  You won't be sorry....and NO, I don't know the author.  I'm putting this as a 5 star because I really liked the books.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary helps me thru every thing and it will help you  I promise.<br />With that said go get the book
B009GJCFL8|3.0|New Asia  has some good moments  but for me lacks that spontaneous passion I find in there older material  Big T
B004W2UBYW|4.0|So much information about this man that has left his mark on the world and forever changed technology. Brilliantly written.
B007HO392S|5.0|This CD has the typical Carrie Underwood sound. It's got some great songs and a good variation of upbeat songs and ballads.  I have all of Carrie Underwood's CD's and this one is just as good as the others! Overall, I'm a big fan and like this album a lot!
0823003590|5.0|This book is exactly what I needed to develop and understand better this specific approach to drawing the face. As other reviews have stated, this the book focuses on a very specific technique: sanguine, sepia, and white Conte pencils on toned paper.
B0017IXOLG|5.0|At a time when bands were starting to throw music and meaningfulness out the window, R.E.M. was keeping the fire of relevance burning bright.  Today these elements are returning to popular music.  I would recommend this and all of their albums to anyone who values real music with real meaning.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It's been a while since I became lost in a story. Took the same leap of faith Jacob did,I suppose. Highly<br />Recommended...especially for the peculiar out there.
B008HOR7UM|4.0|This is another solid offering by Mark, not his best solo outing but still a soothing remedy for a hard day at work! The vinyl edition is of high quality and is pretty rare given the fact that it seems not many are offering this album.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Anything Andrea Bocelli does is golden!  His voice is unlike any other. I would highly recommend this CD. It will put you in the mood.
B006S043TA|3.0|The Brothers Grimm was worth watching, fun for the most part. Heath ledger and Matt Damon have very good chemistry in this movie.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|Just wasn't the app that I thought it would be.  Maybe it will improve as the publisher gets more feedback.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is a very nice way to save your...anything! Anything that you need to save just put on here for easy access to it anytime. It's great for grocery lists and to-do lists. Also if you have anything on your mind just write it down and you can access it anytime you desire or for future tense like for you're kids when they come and get them to bed and tell them stories about your younger self!
B004LWF9R2|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Learned a lot that I did not know about.  And I am an avid Facebook user.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really at first thought that temple run was bad but then I heard about the temple run 2 and I thought I would try it out. So I purchased it and I found out that it is really fun!!!!!!!!!!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Wasn't near as exciting as the version with Sylvester Stallone but it was worth the download price.  Would have liked a little more plot than just shoot em up all the time.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I tried this and liked it so I bought the paid version.  At this point, can't say that I see a big reason to get the paid version.  It would be nice if you could prevent it from looking at local store if you want, I always get duplicate listings for stuff I have on my tablet I have copied from media server.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Gotta love singing.  And who wouldn't love Fat Amy.  I missed this at the movie theatre, so when I saw that I could download it, I jumped right on it.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Well the wife is loving playing with it and she is in her Nerd height of glory. Might have to see if she want any other Doctors/season numbers.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It seemed a little slow but picked up in the middle of the movie.  I seen both gentlemen in better movies
B003JTHXOK|5.0|There is something to be said about novelists who can write about good people and good things.  Of course there is a bad guy, but Sparks, lets us sympathize with his &#34;mentality&#34; too.  I like novels with happy endings.  Don't you?
B004L3L95C|5.0|I have been a fan of this series since the beginning.  I go see each movie and have re-watched all of them as well.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|I love novels actually written by Tom, not his ghost writers.  They just aren't as good, and certainly not worth the e book price.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|I saw a movie called Seal Team Six which was the same thing, the secret raid on Bin Laden. Iwas not impressed. The price of this Blu-Ray is to High. I can pre-order it at Wal-Mart for $19.99.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I had no idea.  I'm lost for better words.  I swear mine and my families diets change today!!!  I am sickened.
0765325950|5.0|There were certainly a few details of plot I could quibble with, probably the same details that other fans would love.  But my gratitude to Sanderson for finishing the story overrides them all.
B0084IRC88|5.0|This is a really well written book.  This is the 2nd book of Diamond's that I've read & I'll read him again.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Channing Tatum turns in a professional performance with his dance, athleticism and overall acting chops.  His range is expanding and has the ability turn on both tough and sensitive nature in the same performance.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|The reality of addiction wasn't sugar coated and it presented a view of addiction and recovery that is bases on human accountability and acknowledgment of responsibility
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie was sweet, irreverent, baudy and terribly funny.  It's a Classic movie that can be watched more than once to produce severe belly laughs.
B007SGM084|4.0|It is a lovely story told in a very unusual setting.  It could be condensed from three to one very well told
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|IT NEEDS MORE TIME! SO HELP ME I WILL NOT GET THE FULL VERSION! MINECRAFT IS BETTER BUT I CANT GET THE FREE VERSION OF THAT ON MY KINDLE! SURVIVAL CRAFT IS FUN! BUT I CANT FIND IT ON MY IPAD!!!!!!!! IT NEEDS MORE FRICKEN TIME!!!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|To date I have had no issues with the game, this is one of my favorites;) would purchase again, thanks
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I would like to highly recommend this product.  It is effecient and reliable.  It is the perfect companion for your Kindle fire
B009DJB8I2|5.0|I love my video game memorabilia and I literally bought this only to have it. The music is pretty fantastic, but loses a lot of it's mojo when out of the context of the game. Personally, I wouldn't listen to it on it's own merits, but all the same, I like that I own this piece of video game history. Also, the codes inside are extremely nice, and to the right buyer you can essentially make your money back on those alone. I'll be keeping mine, but for those that might not, keep that in mind.
0887307280|3.0|This is a great read for the upcoming entrepreneur.  It takes a new approach on how you can approach management.  Other good reads that you might want to consider are  \\"The App Millionaire and \\"Four Hour Work Week\\"

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love amazon apps.But subway surfers is fav!So many jumping and  dodging it's so additive!Love, love,  love it! My fav part is when you see the money you earned for your game.It 's like you get to see how rich you are.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best app I have ever spent my money on and I play it every day I would recommend it to anyone.
B000A7DVR2|3.0|a strange movie..don't understand it, but oh well husband likes it and that's all that counts.  I don't think I  would recommend it to anyone else
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It is really a good book. It was really hard to stop reading.:-)  it was easier to read on the app.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I ordered this case to protect my Kindle Fire screen.  Quick service, I received my order two days after I placed it. My Kindle Fire fits into the case like a glove and provides excellent protection for the screen.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I am enjoying getting to know the characters.  Looking forward to more!  All the actors are great.  The mothers is so dense though!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This a great book with lots knowledge and insight to life.  Its a little different to start with but keeps your attention and afterwards, you appreciate what life brings.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Truly a masterpiece.  Marty Scorsese's best film yet.  Loaded with Hollywood's best actors, the movie bristles with suspense and violence.  A depiction of Irish-American organized crime as never before, this movie truly deserves the Best Director award.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is fairly addicting.  The play is challenging enough to stay interesting but not so difficult as to be frustrating.  I would definately reccomend it to anyone who enjoys the Slider type game.  It's similar but not a knock-off.
B003ASLJO0|4.0|In perhaps another brilliant performance, Eastwood portrays a grizzled Korean War veteran with substance and unflinching accuracy.  His direction was spot-on as well.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I did not like this book.  I purchased it because of the rave reviews and its place on the best seller list.  I had to force myself to finish it because I kept thinking that something would happen to &#34;grab&#34; me--it didn't.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|pacific war is overlooked in my eyes...there should be more focus on it than there is currently.  The island hopping strategy worked.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This book was a fun read.  Unfortunately, Tom Clancy's books are becoming very predictable in their outcomes.  Although the permutations and plot twists entertaining, this is not Clancy's best work.  It is somewhat scary in its look into world of computer hackers.  If hackers are capable of doing half the the things in the book, we are in deep doo doo.
B0006B29WA|5.0|2 cds, of the debut album of a very good band.  nothing is left to say about this, so i stop.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have spread the word to my frail friends...this is a Wonderful story.  The characters were very real and the author may become one of my new favorites.  Loved reading this book.
B005G8AFFG|5.0|Quick and fantastic.  mp3 album---  Arrived in a timely fashion--can't beat that at all.  well done to earn top honors.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Great stories that teach you as well as entertain!  To think Doyle did it as a side job is laughable.  One of the slickest characters ever.
B008011XQQ|5.0|Quick and fantastic.  mp3 album---  Arrived in a timely fashion--can't beat that at all.  well done to earn top honors.
B00979CS50|5.0|I believe something essential happened with Neil Young's music from the point of SLEEPS WITH ANGELS and onwards. While no longer achieving the kind of classic very memorable melodies, like on the early records (perhaps only possible in the lighthearted creative Genius of youth), the music became richer in texture and more subtle and deeper of content. I think it made his music better. Records like SLEEPS WITH ANGELS, MIRROR BALL, GREENDALE, CHROME DREAMS II, and now PSYCHEDELIC PILL, have great songs. On the downside, these songs are sometimes intermingled with more sloppy garage rock efforts that seem to display self-irony, and this interrupts the overall impression, the continuity of mood being too suddenly broken.<br /><br />The destructive thing about Neil Young's music, is its rebellious shabby attitude of hippie dreams, that has inspired a whole generation into becoming slackers. While the music is thoroughly enjoyable and ecstatic, it is ultimately very melancholic. Today our people need all the practical energy and fighting spirit we can muster up, to defend Western society from invading barbarism.<br /><br />I have listened to this record online so far. I will only buy the record if it is released with that alternate cover displayed in the pictures field, with deep space in the background behind the title letters. The large pill on the present cover makes me feel sick with bad recollections of a drug-abusing close relative.
B000002TYX|5.0|Its like recieving new music from the mop tops. Kinda. This is where it all started and these cds dont disappoint. Hope to see more of these types of releases from the lads.........support your favorite artists.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed Suzanne Collins Hunger Games series!  I can not wait for the movie! She is a very entertaining author.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|If your just starting out, this is as good as place as any. Its all remastered and sounding excellent. You get most of the hits even though just about any  Beatles song on any  Beatles album/cd could have been a hit......support your favorite artists.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I love the HBO series Game of Thrones.  I was so glad to find out it was based on a series of books!

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love the HBO series Game of Thrones.  I was so glad to find out it was based on a series of books!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I will not give the Beatles any less than 5 stars on a review. With that said, if you dont own the Red or Blue albums/cd then this could be a good place to start if you're a newbie. Fantastic songs.....support your favorite artists.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I love the HBO series Game of Thrones.  I was so glad to find out it was based on a series of books!

B0025KVLRO|5.0|You can't go wrong  with this early Beatles remastered album/cd.The title says it all &#34;Please Please Me&#34;. You wont be disappointed.... support your favorite artists.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love the HBO series Game of Thrones.  I was so glad to find out it was based on a series of books!
B0043D2DUU|4.0|I have the book as a Kindle book, so the &#34;pocket reference&#34; doesn't count.  It would be great in the physical form to carry with me. It is a 2009 book, and I'm not an expert, so I don't know how accurate it is to the new/current standard for C++; hence the 4 stars. It seems great as a &#34;reference&#34; rather than a &#34;textbook&#34;.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed Suzanne Collins Hunger Games series!  I can not wait for the movie! She is a very entertaining author.
0425263916|4.0|Book was good, but came short of 50 shades.  Needed a deeper plot to hold the reader captive.  I would read this book before 50 shades series.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love the HBO series Game of Thrones.  I was so glad to find out it was based on a series of books!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I would highly recommend it. Best book I have read this year. Go for it!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I guess I don't have much patience, but I find this difficult keep my mind on for any length of time. There's not much to work for and I can't really see that I accomplished anything. But is a way to kill time when you don't have anything to do. HO-HUM
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. Gives you a view if a possible reality. Hoping that it doesn't happen. Hopefully there is another book on the way...
B0063IH60K|5.0|I wanted a program that was easy to use, one that I could win more times than not, yet one that would challenge me and keep me alert to what was happening. This edition of Klondike is a great one. I love it!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Interesting but I don't totally understand the whole thing so am not thrilled with it yet. Maybe later after I have explored more.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just as interesting as the last two.Looking forward to the next.Next fall is marked in my calendar for sure.This is a great series.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Didn't like this game. Perhaps kids woould like it better.  Glad it was free cause I have deleted it from my Kindle.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The calibration process is easy and then you have a reliable way to know how much battery power is left and the temperature of the phone and battery health. I use it for both Nexus 7 and Droid 4 and the best part is having the percentage in the upper left corner instead of having to go to the settings to get percentages in blocks of 10%
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Liked it enough to finish all four on my vacation.  Loved the movies but wanted more so all satisfied and happy!
B004SI12CU|3.0|I ordered this book because my book club was reading it. It started VERY slowly for me; I found it difficult to &#34;get into&#34;. However, it did get better - became a better read- after the first few attempts! The subject, Frank Lloyd Wright, was of course the biggest draw.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am not writing a review.  The book is fantastic from beginning to end.  All of his books are. I always recommend his books to others.
0345803507|2.0|This book was nothing earth shattering. It did not move me in any way. It was the predictable ending to a series of three novels; most likely all three written at once, with an eye on the final prize of a tv series or a movie deal. It read like a cheap romance, was entertaining on the airplane, but was not anything to write home about, nor to recommend to my colleagues. I am suprised how much press it is getting world-wide. I guess I should stick to the classics and leave this sort of book to the pop masses!<br /><br />The purchase experience was flawless; I was completely pleased with the seller's service and professionalism.
B00078XGRO|5.0|This movie arrived earlier than I had hoped for and the first thing I had to do was to open it and watch it. Fantastic movie.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|The game is fun to kill some time but your money disappears. You constantly lose money even if you don't spend any. One time it took me two days to expand the store because every time I I tried thousands of  dollars would disappear and it would say I didn't have enough.
030758836X|3.0|This is not the type of book I usually read,  I found it very clever.  A very twisted plot.  Not a very appealing heroine.
0307346617|5.0|At first it was hard to get a hang of with all the different stories but after i got into it i loved it!
B008ASGP3U|5.0|i've loved every one of Rankin's Rebus books (and I think I have read all of them except Tooth and Nail, which was<br />bought recently)  Standing in Another Man's Grave was wonderful and I'm so glad Rankin brought Rebus back!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I was expecting a little drama but this was mostly a happy tale about losing one's virginity with a little catholic guilt thrown it. The story and characters were fairly lighthearted and much more easily accepting than I have found people to be in real life. However, this story was set in Berkley CA.  As the priest said to Mark Obrien re losing his virginity, &#34;go for it&#34;!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|If you like Mario Brothers then this is a great app for you!I am only 10 and it is AWESOMELY AWESOME!!!!(that's why I rated it 5 stars)I think you should get it.plus it's FREE!what better deal a l than that???? It is just like Mario Brothers!thanks for reading!  -Mikeyla10
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo is a gripping movie that depicts a story many of us lived through and watched unfold every night on the evening news. The entire cast does an excellent job. The story pulls you in right to the heart of Terahn. I would definately reccommend this movie.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It work well no problms enjoyed playing the game need it for PC also. It was an easy download I would refer it to others
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game because you get to do whatever you want to their hair and they don't care....... it was so much fun I played it for an hour straight. It is a lot of fun! You should get it too!
B00377V6J2|5.0|Greatest music from the King Albert and Little Stevey.  It was just so great to get the video too.  Reccomend this highly.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is awesome, but it should have a kindle fire hd app or version or whatever, but the android version is still pretty cool.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|It's was a great read.  Very original plot.  Kept you thinking to the end.  Ad then you catch your breath.  Loved it.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|It's a typical low budget English series.  The writing is poor, the acting is marginal, and the special effects are low-grade.  It won't knock your socks off but, it does kill time.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|\\"Sliver Linings Playbook\\" easily ranks among the best romantic comedies of the third millennium (eight Oscar nominations are a good proof of that). Although it contains elements of drama or psychological movie, at heart it is indeed a romance, with some fresh quirkiness, similar to films like \\"Juno\\" or \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\", thrown in.    To a wide movie-going audience, the picture rather realistically depicts the inner torture that adults go through following such stressful situations as death of a spouse or marital infidelity. First half of the movie is steeped in depicting - with sympathy and insight - the predicament of Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper), who, after eight months in mental hospital for attacking his unfaithful wife, must still cope with a restraining order and fits of temper. The film's second hour, with Pat's hesitating affair with young widow Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence) taking center stage, is even more rewarding for a viewer, with details and paradoxes of life in current America blossoming fully in the script, decently adapted from the Matthew Quick's bestseller (by director David O.Russell).    The film's main asset is the cast - every single role gets more than a capable actor to play. Bradley Cooper's natural style in a difficult role complements well with a star-making turn of Jennifer Lawrence. Solatano parents, the superstitious, illegally-bookmaking football fanatic dad (Robert DeNiro) and the anxious, ever-loving and sacrificing mom (Jacki Weaver) clearly project the movie's forgiving, understanding attitude toward its characters.    The finale makes a silver lining of its own for the story, accentuating its positive outlook on life. And although the movie cannot avoid some cliches regarding positiveness and family life misgivings, these are not overly stressed. Thinking viewers would probably welcome some more of Pat's thinking and reasoning - mainly in the final parts of the movie we must be satisfied only with some shortcuts ofhis mind - yet it can be safely said that \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\", for all its ventures into dark recesses of human soul, is a worthy addition to contemporary romantic comedy.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This is just an awesome movie. I laughed until my sides hurt and actually had to pause the movie at one point to catch my breath! An easy five stars!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love the beautiful pictures.  Need to be able to change the background color as it is not enough contrast  between puzzle and background.  This is my favourite puzzle app.  I have deleted all the others.  Appreciate all the fess extra puzzle pic.
B00B6DTWM2|5.0|Best Horror movie I have seen in years. I am an obsessed Horror fan and usually laugh at even the better ones. I was not laughing with this one.. Very creepy and original!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Easy to read and a joy to remember.  Be sure to get this series.  You will not regret it, promise.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I HAVE PLAYED BOTH GAMES AND TDKR IS BY FAR THE BEST GAME TAKES A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA BUT ITS WORTH IT IF YOU GET STUCK ON A LEVEL RESTART THE LEVEL OR KEEP TRYING THIS IS A MUST GET<br />MY GAMELOFT LIVE ACCOUNT USERNAME IS Furgengurgle LOOK ME UP.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is quite the release for a boring afternoon. Some of the screens frustrate me soo much i just can't stop. :)
B0002VFXFE|4.0|Hard for me to really rate this because the PS3 I fixed only last for about another 20 hours, all though was long enough for me to retrieve my hard disk info, but am unsure whether this compound played a negative role.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|The Stargate franchise did not spend much time on moral reflection in SG-1 since the emphasis and point of the series was aimed more at surviving the thrust of Earth into a dangerous galactic threat and the adventures that came with it.  SGA did offer more opportunities to consider the moral consequences of choices but rarely took advantage of them in the first 4 seasons.  The 5th (and ultimately final) season gave more consideration as to how the actions and decisions of the Atlantis expedition had impacted the lives and political stability of the alien races they encountered.  While not the primary purpose of science fiction, often the best science fiction does address moral and philosophical questions.  SGA is certainly not philosophical.  It is very much a series in the action/adventure mold of the original SG-1 series.  But it did include go further in raising the moral, and ethical questions than most television science fiction television programming of the past couple of decades.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not much more here than in the first book and none of the sense of discovery that was experienced in the first book. Still, it is the 2nd book for Pete's sake and one must dutifully plow through it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I loved the format this author used in pulling together a poignant story with a young girl as the protagonist. The place her books played in her own survival and development, and the helping of others was brilliant.<br />I thought the character development was well-done. I had a very good sense of each person's place in the story.<br />This book gave me a sense of the life of the German people during the Hitler era, the fears, the surviving, the mixed emotions and thoughts as all were pulled into such a crazy time and trying to maintain their own sense of integrity.
0525952926|2.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth and the sequel I was excited about the 20th Century trilogy.  This second book seems to have been written by someone else.  The sentence structure is juvenile and simple.  Certainly not what I expected from the same great writer of Pillars.  Will finish the book because I don't quit but will be glad when it is over.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Wild was a good read, and an amazing story about a woman who was lost and confused in her own life. I was surprised she dared to do a massive hike like this, not only poorly prepared, but alone. I can see why putting herself through this challenge made her wake up to who she is as a person on her own and therefore more able to live the life she wanted more contentedly and successful. It was beautiful to see how the hikers did watch out for one another when they could, while at the same time respecting each person's journey.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Having seen all of the Bond movies as\when they came out I must put this on at the top of my favorite list.<br />Even tho S.C. was the first I do believe that D.C. is the best.  This may be due to a better script but D.C.<br />seems to put a seriousness into Bond that S.C. only had in the first couple films, before gadgets and stunts became the main focus.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|I gave this a 4 star rating as the Kindle fits well in this case, it is good quality leather and construction, and I love the bright color. The stand works well when viewing and it does not collapse. I did not give it 5 stars as you must leave the case open while charging it which seems a bit sloppy.<br />Very satisfied overall.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|If you are a fan of Bond Movies then you will enjoy this. I give it 4 stars. Worth seeing.
B002RT2BXQ|2.0|Being an avid Ayn Rand fan I felt offended By the way the Director changed the personalities of her characters .  If you've read her novels you would know that her heroes are anything but emotional .  They are strong willed exceptional people who don't over react to adversity. In this movie they are transformed into weaker  versions of themselves  making my heart drop . I wish the Producers would have had more respect  for work !
B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|I was expecting a lot more due to the hype around this movie. I give it 3 stars. Worth seeing but not life changing.
B00122FTVK|3.0|The CD is a must have for any hardcore fan. The songs that stick out the most and hardcore are Sinatra and Wax and Wane. The other songs are cool and I am glad that I finally got them in my catalog.
B00006DEF9|5.0|One of the best movies ever! Even though it was made so long ago, my preschool grandkids even love it. It has great music, fantastic dancing, light comedy, and a corny love story...what else could you want?
B002B0NAV8|3.0|The ones that stick out the most are Be Quiet and Drive Far away and My Own Summer. Those are the songs that stick out.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|it is a great strategic war game. every one should get this game  and they will love it. ecipally strategiests.
B009YU6FJM|3.0|The CD is not bad. I love Deftones and I give them credit for their constructive intellect but this album is good, but not great.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|These shows makes me laugh every time.  Had some friends over who had never seen the show and now they are addicted
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I am not big on music, and this may be old news for those in the know, but you tap when a song is playing and it tells you in no time at all, what the song is (and all related info).<br /><br />Even got the theme song from the Kathy Show when i was just testing it.<br /><br />Fun
B003SHDP4K|3.0|It's a real page turner but the characters are really flat and sometimes quite frankly a bit corny. But none the less, it's a thrilling book about an interesting topic!
B004UID2LC|1.0|KINDLE FIRE HD 7\\"<br /><br />One of the first apps I downloaded.  FIRST USE SEEMED REALLY GOOD, THEN THINGS WENT WRONG ..... THOUGHT IT WAS ME UNTIL I WENT BACK AND SAW THE OTHER MALWARE COMPLAINTS WITH THIS APP.<br /><br />DON'T GET IT !
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put it down but wasn't a fan of the ending...don't want to give it away. I stayed up late to finish it and felt disappointed at the end.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|This book is at least three times too long.  Get an editor! And most of the detailed violence is gratuitous.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I loved this this movie. It draws a parallel between traditional spying and new cyber-spying, and makes the case that there is a need for both in this world.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, Doesn't freeze up, has wonderful graphics and is a surprisingly wonderful game. Get it. I at first thought it would be a waste of time but was wrong. Doesn't even have ads either.
B008Y6R8J8|4.0|Kathleen Turner was probably a tad old for this role, but she did a great job.  What a fun and entertaining movie.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|Mother was a diabetic back in the 40's and starch was raising her sugar.. BUT there are different kinds and these are understood today... Red potatoes. , whole original real grains, root vegetables with lots of nutrients.. Wonderful. I am now free to be &#34;full&#34; in my dinners and not wanting to &#34;cheat for a sweet. after dinners.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This was a really cute game. The plot was a tad difficult to follow (not that that really mattered) .  The hidden objects were sometimes easy and other times more challenging to find. I'd consider another game by this company in the future.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|As I neared the end of this book I was really considering giving it 3 stars. The book started off great, I really enjoyed the sense of being I got from Sophie and her home in Market Chipping. As it went on, she struggled through a curse and finding her way into a new life, leaving behind the one she knew before. It struck me odd when I was reading it that Sophie took the curse in stride. She didn't have any mental struggles with the curse, she just trudged along.<br /><br />But, the great thing about this book is the author's ability to weave mystery in, without you even knowing it. When the end of the book came about and the mysteries were revealed I sat back and thought &#34;huh, that is pretty neat.&#34;<br /><br />There wasn't much adventure. Sophie seems to sit around the castle getting into mischief pretty frequently, and often she wants to leave the place, only to be detained somehow. In fact, this constant &#34;I am leaving because I am upset! Oh wait, something happened and I can't,&#34; happens so often I almost put the book down. Seriously I think it happens 4 or 5 times. But, even without the adventure, there are magical battles and let me just say, they are pretty extraordinary. I would have thought hurling lightning and fireballs, but that doesn't really happen, it is more mind bending.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate the entire book a 3, if it weren't for the end. The ending was . . . perfect. It has to be, since the ending alone secured a 4 star rating. Overall, I will not read the book again (that is saved for such engrossing works as Harry Potter and David Eddings) but I can look back on this book pleasantly.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Love that she comments as director, and we can see on the additional disc, how she rehearsed her vision before<br />making the film. A movie ahead of its time too for showing the capability and power<br />of a woman, in the period it was staged, and in the 1980's when it was made!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I love the Supernatural series and was tickled to find the entire third season set of DVD's here at a much cheaper rate than found in most department stores.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I ordered a cd which was promised to be in very good condition. It was as good as they claimed. I'm happy with my purchase.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I bought this DVD collection as a Christmas gift for our son.  He has become a great fan of the series and was absolutely thrilled with it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I have 3 Kindles, one the original Kindle Fire and one the Larger Kindle HD, and one 2nd generation.  I use all of them at different times, places and for different reasons.  I found it was necessary to have a second charging cable for when I am babysitting and not at home.  So far, it has worked well charging all 3 Kindles.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I bought this DVD collection as a Christmas gift.  My son loves the series and was absolutely thrilled with them.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I gave this book 3 stars only because it was very similar to Sleeping with the Enemy. Details a little different, but still same story line. I always enjoy Nicholas Sparks so I cannot say that I am disappointed. I don't want to give away the ending, but I did like the ending when everything is revealed in the letter. Nicholas Sparks fans will not be disappointed.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I love the Supernatural series and was absolutely thrilled to find the entire fourth season here at a much cheaper rate than I could find in most stores.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|it is alsome and it Is easy for kids. I love it. it is easy fun and there are all kinds of charters of Penguins
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not only does the author give a first hand account of the killing of the most hated man in the world, but his becoming a SEAL and his rise to team 6. Great story telling and personal accounts about missions he took part of. Highly recommended, I couldn't put it down once I picked it up.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I love this cd ... the sound of Rodriguez is unlike anything you have heard. If you watched 'Searching for Sugarman' then you have only a small taste of what to expect. It's an awesome cd.
B000025XKM|5.0|I liked all the three Nick Drake's albums, but this one was its peak.<br /><br />The maturity of his songwriting its finally ready to bloom after the first two albums, different approaches reaches the young english boy from the sad wounds he had inside of him... the depressed side of Drake emerges during the whole record, and in the title track or in another masterpiece as &#34;Things Behind The Sun&#34; a simple acoustic guitar gives you the feeling that something behind the sun was there indeed, mourning with him.<br /><br />The instrumental interludes are interesting as they give a great glimpse of &#34;breathing&#34; and &#34;rhythm&#34; in a record where just guitar and voice are present (and the wonderful piano of the title track)... and seems to lighten up a little the mood with some inner weirdness... a sort of walk in Drake's secret garden, before the record ends and the tragedy took his toll, taking away the boy from this world at such a young age it's a shame.<br /><br />To me, the perfect album to listen for understand the whole universe of this young, melancholic fellow who left us all too soon.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Great, but Coming from Reality has more substance. Get both and you will not miss out. Excellent cd's and I'd like more.
0375831002|5.0|This is a masterpiece of words and wisdom through reflection and creative writing skills. I felt as if I was watching the scenes unfold on the street right beside the characters whose depth knows no bounds. This book is brilliant and thought provoking. I dont believe it would be possible for it to have been any better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My daughter mentioned I should be watching Downton Abbey, so using my Amazon Prime membership to view past seasons' episodes, I began with Season 1.  I am hooked!  Once I began watching, I could stop.  I am sitting up every night viewing at least three episodes.  This program is so intriguing.  The history of that era, the quality of the acting and the in-depth characterization of these people is wonderful.  What a story line to follow.  My only concern is when I no longer have episodes remaining.  I highly recommend this series to everyone.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I uploaded my first book with illustrations to Kindle. This book talked me through how to do it in a way that made it easy for me.
B001EBWITA|5.0|One of my fav movies. Keanu Reeves has been a favorite actor of mine since &#34;Speed&#34;. If you love Sci-fi, the apocalyptic genre, and battles between the natural and spiritual realm, then you'll like this movie. No complaints here!
B00881VLCE|2.0|There are not enough choices of puzzles.  The ones that are available are easy and dont have much detail. Fun game if you like to work easy puzzles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great. Updated version of 1 with new items and more! This game is just to great to not get.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing. If you  like action and thrill definitely get this game. Also it is ten times better than subway surfers.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I love this series. I'm basically getting these so I can watch all of the bloopers which I think are really funny.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I like being able to try a game out before you buy it but this was way to short. I didn't even have time to figure out how to play before it ended.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I got this app for the kids, and haven't told them about it yet.  I'm sure they will love it just as much as I do.
B00933JF74|5.0|I really liked playing this on my Findel Fire. It worked great and was many hours of building without having to buy something.
B004J09ONG|5.0|Great true story. I remember this movie from when i was a kid. I watched it with my children. A bit graffic in spots but with animals in the wild i guess that it is hard to avoid.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|The game is Time killing and awesome , i recommend everybody who likes killing mutants with a car , purchase this. This game rocks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my daughter and I enjoy this game, fun but not overly complicated for young ones!  pretty graphics, wish gems were a bit easier to get though.
B0094K1QR8|1.0|but I started to watch it anyway. Note &#34;started&#34; - then I turned it off. I have to add a word.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie! It was hilarious and just a overall great movie, I have watched it twice already because I loved it so much! I would definitely recommend watching it! =)
B0027GGL6W|5.0|Glimpses into the history of music and culture are valuable, but more fun withe such great performances! Truly enjoyed it!
B00005NPWA|5.0|Works as advertised. Upgraded my eyepiece on my DSLR along with the Nikon DK-3 eyecup. Helps keep the light out when you are shooting outside in bright sunlight. Highly recomended.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Excellent!  Great final book on a great trilogy!  Preston and Child keep producing absorbing and thrilling adventures of Pendergast. I hope they write more.
B008CJ0KI8|3.0|Not as good as the nostalgia ultra mixtape. Expected nonstop play but found myself changing tracks. However still a fan
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|Haven't really used the app.  Not sure if I like it or not.  Believe it only comes with one level.  Sort of disappointed.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|Great add on for Kindle Fire HD. style and ease of use is why I got it. Glad I have it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a simple no non-sense camera bag. Its got plenty of space for 2 camera bodies and couple of lenses and an external flash. Plenty of pockets for little things. The size of the bag is just right, not too big or too small.  The price is not bad at all compared to some of the name brand bags that cost over $100. I highly recommend this.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great add on for you mobile device. I put it on a Kindle Fire HD and really have taken advantage of it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Watch it, you'll love it. And start from season one episode one and watch sequentially. A story about surviving a ZA apocalypse and surviving what's left of humanity.
B00AZLBIAA|5.0|Accidently my wifi password got changed and updated. This helped me know what it was so I could get in and change it to something I knes.
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|I watched this movie because I was intrigued with the idea of a hero saving everyone by taking a risky move to fly a plane upside down to save everyone. I like hero movies.  Unfortunately, this is NOT a hero movie, and the trailer showing the plane maneuver really misled me. There is almost no redeeming quality to this movie. The most significant lesson I learned is that an alcoholic can take cocaine to wake up and function while drunk. I also learned that by taking cocaine, he at times might appear not to be drunk when he really is. I didn't know that. Now I do.<br /><br />This movie to me was offensive with nudity and language, primarily because my young daughter was sitting on the couch next to me. I can look past that in movies that have some redeeming quality, like a good moral or lesson. The only lesson here is that an alcoholic finally told the truth to protect the name of a dead person, and this resulted in years of prison time for him. Did he finally do the right thing? I think many people would say no, that he was stupid to tell the truth.<br /><br />The movie did accurately portray the problems of substance abuse, causing broken families and hospital stays. It also highlights that sometimes a drunk can be functional even when flying an aircraft. Okay, we already know this. The problem was that it was so boring and depressing to watch this play out. I was expecting a movie with a hero that perhaps I could emulate or aspire to be. Instead, I got a movie about a drunk who constantly lies and in the end gets sentenced to years in prison when in an emotional outburst he finally tells the truth.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Love this for watching movies and videos on my mobile device. It is easy to operate and adjujst for format.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|The app doesn't seem to use too many resources and provides the necessary tools for file management.  User interface is easy to navigate.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I was glad to find this app for Kindle Fire. It is a nice addition to the other apps I have on my mobile
B005HSL626|5.0|Fast paced fun. Was hard for me to stop playing at times, and once in a while was only forced to by playing till my battery died. Fun to try to beat your significant others score.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Not just for the kids, all ages will find this film very enjoyable. With great message especially if you believe in magic.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|The app is lightweight and does what you need it to. I have tried other task management apps that seem to drain as much of the battery as the apps they are killing. Note that in the Kindle Fire you need to kill task manually because you cant use the widget (device issue, not an app issue).
B006WXHJNU|5.0|great movie. amazing acting good story very entertaining and of course it has my girl Live Tyler with her amazing acting love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Watch it 3 time in 3 week so I Recommend this to any superhero fans.
B00913DPW2|1.0|okay I got this on sale for free. thank the lord I got it for free. I would NEVER pay 1.99 for this stupid game. not worth it. waaaaaaaaaaay to complicated. if u cant figure it out without a walkthru its stupid. I hated it.
B002ZG9774|5.0|great movie. amazing acting good story very entertaining and of course it my girl Christina with her amazing voice love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book has kept me giggling even when I'm all alone. It's typical Ellen deadpan delivery that delivers a zinger at every corner. Very cute!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Fun for the whole family, addictive and just plain awesome! The graphics are nice and you can't beat the price.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|Purchased program to use on my tablet. Installed it, immediately wanted to upgrade. Attempted to do so and the program shut down. Tried editing word document and the program shut down. Even at .99 the program is overpriced--I wouldn't buy it again and I'm going to attempt to get my money back. Simply put, the program stinks.
B003O86FMW|4.0|sort of scary<br />couldnt sleep at night once games started<br />overall good book<br />very interesting<br />made for teens and adults
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! the only problem with it, is it doesnt always want to work. sometimes the game wont start up. its actually really frustrating. If you guys could fix that, i would be forever grateful.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|What a perfect little item.  I was happy to see that when little parts like this wear out that there was actually a replacement. Took me a minute to figure out how to get the old broken ear piece off. All you have to do is push down while turning and it'll pop right off.  Putting the new one on is simply once you've taken the old one off.  This saved me a lot of money from having to buy a new Bluetooth, especially when it was still good.
0805028846|4.0|I have collected pop-ups for over 35 years and I have even attempted to make a few rudimentary ones myself. Now I know how to do it properly, and with this book as my guide, I will be 'wowing' all my friends and family with my cleverness. No more boring old 'flat' cards for me! This could be you, too. Get the book. Simple.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Resist the Resistance. It's deep inside you every morning. Watch TV, procrastinate, don't believe in your abilities...Resistance. Read this book. Peace
B004Q7E0TA|4.0|I remember Portia de Rossi from Ally McBeal and from the movie 'Sirens'. Maybe you only know her as Ellen Degeneres' 'significant other' and now, wife. However you were aware of her, I'll bet that like me, you had no idea of the inner struggles she was facing in her life. These struggles pushed her into anorexia and a fight for her life. It is a detailed and chilling account of how self image and a lack of emotinal awareness of our core needs can so utterly derail a seemingly charmed life. Portia holds nothing back, and I think this has got to have been helpful to her in her own healing process and hopefully helpful to others who may be struggling still. If you have ever struggled with anything in your life, you will find this a compelling story.
B002JODUI4|3.0|a lot of the songs on this cd sound the same but strobe has to be my favorite song and for a lack of a better name not one of my favorite albums by them cd came in great condition shipped fast too just not happy with the music
B000I0QK74|5.0|Christmas with James Taylor, serenading you with all the traditionally loved songs. What could be cozier? I even like his add-libbed vege-friendly line in The Christmas Song (You know - Chestnuts roasting o'er an open fire.. .). Buy the CD, and Next Christmas, YOU could be the one cozying up to a warm fire with James Taylor!
B005FLX1HS|5.0|for an ep album this is great love skrillex this was a great buy plan on buying other cds from them
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Fringe was an outstanding series. This includes all 5 seasons really. I'm sorry that it did not last past 5 seasons.
0385493622|5.0|This is a fantastic book. For those who don't know (most of the world), Pierre de Fermat was an amateur mathematician of the seventeenth century who wrote the famous (to a small portion of the world) line on the page of a book, \\"I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.\\" He claimed to have a proof of a great mathematical problem, but no one has ever discovered what that proof was. For 350 years, mathematicians around the world tried to recreate a proof of Fermat's \\"last theorem,\\" as it was called, and failed. But in 1994, Andrew Wiles wrote a 130 page proof, thus solving the world's greatest mathematical problem.<br /><br />That synopsis is not what sucked me into this book. No, what got me was the incredible history of the world's greatest mathematical problem (dating all the way back to Pythagoras) and the simplicity of the problem itself. Singh, the author, points out that it is so simple that a child can understand it but so difficult to prove that it took 350 years to finally pin it down. This book is absolutely loaded with some of the greatest true stories I have ever read.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I read a book for pleasure, cover to cover. I usually have my nose in a textbook. But really, Fermat's Enigma was beautiful from start to finish and very difficult to put down. Here is one of many great quotes from the book, this one from Ian Stewart:<br /><br />\\"An astronomer, a physicist, and a mathematician (it is said) were holidaying in Scotland. Glancing from a train window, they observed a black sheep in the middle of a field. 'How interesting,' observed the astronomer, 'all Scottish sheep are black!' To which the physicist responded, 'No, no! Some Scottish sheep are black!' The mathematician gazed heavenward in supplication, and then intoned, 'In Scotland there exists at least one field, containing at least one sheep, at least one side of which is black.'\\"<br /><br />And here's a limerick someone wrote in celebration of Wiles's proof, as quoted from Singh's book:<br /><br />\\"My butter, garçon, is writ large in!\\"<br />A diner was heard to be chargin',<br />\\"I had to write there,\\"<br />Exclaimed waiter Pierre,<br />\\"I couldn't find room in the margarine.\\"<br /><br />If you're not a mathematician, don't let that keep you from reading this book. It's not written for mathematicians. And if you're thinking of reading it, just do so.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not one to read this genre of literature however after hearing many compelling critiques of this piece I decided to take a chance and attempt reading it. I found it to be an excellent change from the historical fiction I'm more accustomed to. It is extremely well written and captures one's focus.  I'm almost afraid to read the following book due to the negative and neutral reviews. Very refreshing to find such a strong character of Katniss and submissive character of Peeta.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it! Captivated me from the first page til the last page. Very well written and a great plot!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I love Preston & Child. I like Agent Pedergast. However, this book was a bit fantastical even by Pendergasts' standards.  Too much history of Pendergast and his past, his Ward and her past, his wife and her past, etc. to be able to keep an eye on the story plot.  I did however, turn pages as fast as the Kindle would go.
B0076DELIG|5.0|A real page turner from start to finish! Just enough twists to keep the reader guessing. Harry Bosch has flaws like everyone else makes him very real
B0025KVLVA|5.0|This CD has 33 songs on it.  I am a Beatles fan, grew up listening to the Beatles.  This CD is Remastered, meaning its in Stereo and not mono.  The first CD is some not so know Beatles songs, like &#34;Thank You Girl&#34; and John Lennon's &#34;Bad Boy&#34;.  Great to hear the first Cd in stereo and not boring old mono.  The second CD is the CD you normally bought when you bought this CD years ago.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has done a wonderful job of tying up this series.  The way it is written it seems as if Robert Jordan wrote it himself.  The syntax hasn't changes at all from earlier books. This was a wonderful conclusion to the series. Although I am sad that the series has come to an end.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat and reading until the very end. Can't wait to read the next book!!!
B000FA5STS|5.0|I am a big David Baldacci fan.  Would highly recommend this book.  Another page turner.  He never disappoints the reader.
B0037VNX44|3.0|clockwork orange meets prison.  a bit violent with not too much of a story arc, but maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a movie about a guy whose story I struggle to associate with.
0670020745|5.0|we needed to know everything we could about strokes. this book was written by a brain scientist that had a stroke it was easy to understand and really helped us.would recommend this to anyone who needed to know anything about a stroke.
B007SGM084|3.0|Review from my wife - &#34;I like the story but the writing wasn't amazing.  With better writing the story could've been more entertaining.  Instead it's a bit blunt, to the point, and at times ridiculously unbelievable.  Not that I thought this was a true story but a better story teller could get you into the world and not care about the reality of the content.  It was a bit silly actually and you can tell that wasn't the writer's intent.&#34;
1451629184|5.0|This was a very good book.  So sorry it took so long for this child to be found. Glad she was sofe.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|See my comments on Series 1 previously.  I was thrilled to be able to use Prime to play catchup for this series that so many folks recommended to me.  It is well worth the time spent watching.
B0061QD88S|5.0|Yet another one of my favorite disney movies.  I had to have it on a dvd since my old copy is a beta.
B004EK926K|4.0|A nice take on a classic film.  The whole family enjoyed it and highly recommend it.  We watched it several times.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is better than the virtual playground game, It is so addictive and it earns cash while you are gone
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Unlimited alarm settings is most helpful. If I miss an appointment, it's because I didn't set an alarm. Great app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is such a fun game. It is actually better than temple run. Instead of monkeys chasing you, there is a cop chasing you. There are also a lot more players to unlock than in temple run. There are also trains that you have to run past. Some are moving and some are not. You can even jump on the trains. The power ups in subway surfers are a lot better than the ones in temple run. There are bouncy shoes,a coin magnet,a mystery box,and a coin multiplier. The makers of subway surfers change the setting where you run about every two months. Once it was in New York. Another time it was winter. Right now you can run in Rio. For each place where you run there is a limited edition character you can unlock. I definitely recommend this game to kids and even adults!
B007HACDLK|4.0|although it ended kind of quickly for me it was another good read from vince Flynn and looking fordward to the next one
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book was even more amazing and twisted than the last two, and I couldn't put it down. Almost nothing compares.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|4.0|So I ordered and received Straight out of Hell. Much to my surprise Helloween sound fresh still and although the songs were not as catchy as let's say Keeper of the 7 Keys 1 & 2, they are musically arranged phenomenally well. The vocals are ever present and fierce and the guitar work is classic Helloween with minor 2013 evolutionary and technological changes, along with thundering drums and growling Bass lines driving the bottom end! The Keyboard is defined and not overpowered by the guitars, bass or drums, which makes for a well blended and rounded sound throughout the album. I'm glad to see Helloween continue the Power Metal legacy they began in 1984, even with the line-up changes! The current incarnation of Helloween is still doing justice to the songs that built their legacy, even with only 2 of the original members being Michael Weikath & Markus Grosskopf!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I've read all of the diary of a simply kid books, but this one is my least favorite. There isn't enough content to find it funny, and not as much as in the other books. I would recommend this series to people who like laughing at random things.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this game. So glad it is free! I have no problems with it on my phone or Kindle.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|No where does it say that you need an internet connection to play after you download. I got it for my sons kindle but with out wifi he cant get on.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Flynn is an excellent writer, but the real joy in this book is the plotting - she has developed a really unique and effective device for telling her story, the opposing first-person accounts of a husband and wife gone bad - it is truly a page turner, and Flynn has just the right touch throughout to keep the reader engaged and thirsting for more, especially when she introduces one of several curve balls that have you saying out loud, &#34;Wow, I did not expect that!&#34;<br /><br />This is a great read, wondefully written and plotted, one of my favorite books of all time...
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love the way it appears and easy to use. All smiles. I have my mail linked to all of my devises
034580404X|4.0|I bought this as a gift and was very impressed with the quick delivery. There is nothing I disliked about the collection . I would recommend it. Thanks
B0076UXKDG|5.0|Although the big DSLRs like my Nikon D800 are already heavy, I like the feel much better with one of these grips added on. It makes the camera much more comfortable to hold vertically, and I find that the extra heft and surface area actually let me hold the camera a bit more steadily.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it can take a variety of batteries, from Nikon's rechargeable batteries, to conventional AA's. I find that a set of lithium AA's gets me well over 2500 shots, and they're easy to replace anywhere. Attaching one also boosts the frame rate of your camera, though that's really secondary to me.<br /><br />Construction quality is what you'd expect from Nikon's pro-grade gear. It's rugged, well-sealed against dirt and moisture and will probably last longer than the camera it's attached to. It has the expected tripod adapter on the bottom, and generally, the only time you'll want to remove it from the camera would be to access the battery in the camera itself.<br /><br />Still, most people complain about two things on these devices. One, the product is essentially the same as the MB-D10 you might have used on your Nikon D300, but the older unit doesn't fit on the newer camera bodies. I was in this situation myself, and it was certainly frustrating to need to buy a new grip when my old one seemed almost identical.<br /><br />Complaint number two is generally the price. At the list price of over $600 (US), this seems like an extravagant accessory, and I'm not sure I would have paid that much for mine. There are third-party versions of this same grip that are much less expensive. Still, Amazon offers the MB-D12 at about a 40% discount, putting it right about the same price as I paid for my MB-D10.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great accessory for your D800/D800E, and in spite of the cost, I wouldn't live without it.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|If You want to  really  waste your money then download this game. Once you pay from that point on you will only lose more and more money.  Best advice I  can give you is play only with what they give you daily or better yet play a game that doesn't rip you off
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I enjoyed the graphics and puzzles. Finished in 3 hours. Response time a bit slower than I like while navigating and that's the only reason for the 4 stars. I did get stuck in Tesla's room and rebooted my fire. Later I figured out that you click on the door. I recommend this game!
B008S4FZHI|3.0|I always like Kay Scarpette, but something about this book left me darker than usual.  Though well written and well constructed, as usual, there is something missing here.
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|I will admit that I have not played it much, but I am a huge h.p. lovecraft fan. This has been very nicely put together. Love how you can mix and match your investigators. A bit too much luck involved in getting what you need in your book to complete tasks to get five stars.
B004KZOWEG|5.0|The DRC is an enormous country with an abundance of natural resources.  This intriguing history of the exploitation and abuse by one single man and the reprecussions still felt today are well worth the read. Very well written Something to keep in your personal library.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The movie does a nice job incorporating parts of the last Bourne movies to bring the movie watcher into what this movie is about. However, this movie was a bit slower and had some scenes that were too long winded (chase in Philippines). Its just OK.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A must reads is you enjoyed the first book Fall of Giants.  The same characters continue their lives in a Europe on the verge of World War II
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Loved the characters, and liked that even though older, they were portrayed as interesting and independent. Judi Dench is amazing!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My 16 year-old granddaughter loves the series, The Walking Dead.  I decided this first season DVD would be a great gift as her family doesn't have cable.  She loved it.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I love this movie, but still like the original better..... Great comparison, I think they actually studied the original....but brought it to today's reality.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome!!:) I play it every day and I absolutely love my horse!:) I want a unicorn though haha!:)
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Several good story turns, relentess, involving, turns into a page turned. I really enjoyed the book. I will continue to purchase Lee Child books.
B000W93CHC|5.0|World without end is one of those books that lets you get lost in the story. The size is a bit overwhelming, and the story is quite daunting at times, but well worth the read. Coming in over 1000 pages, it is not the type of book you read in one afternoon. It took me quite a while to finish this book. But each time I picked it up again, I was able to immediately get back into the story.<br /><br />If you enjoy rich, European historical fiction, you will enjoy World Without End. You will also enjoy my new novel [[ASIN:B007QG7NRO Not Without Mercy The Black Death]] (Book 1 in the series), based in Bristol England during the Black Plague between 1348-1350. It is about half the size in pages to World Without End, at just over 535 pages. If you like books about Faith, Family, Love, Courage, Hope and Redemption, you love my new novel.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Really like this album but it is just shy of the first album for me... tough follow on for the band though and still really really good.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington did a great job in this movie.  Pretty sad how an alcoholic can act so normal and throw their life away.  I really like the way the movie ended.  Sort of bitter sweet!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A fascinating window into the plight of the&#34;common&#34; person in early 19th century Europe, but very long. For me this wasn't a problem. Hugo lived through the events he describes in the book so you could expect it to be fairly accurate, although there is a lot of politics under lying the story. The book can be read as a story of redemption and hope, with the Christian God being ever present, although perceived very differently by the various characters. Hugo spends much more time developing his characters than you might be used to from the various movie or musical versions, and this aids greatly in understanding their motives.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|I was introduced to the zombie genre through the awesome t.v. show, The Walking Dead. From there, I learned about Max Brooks' books. I really enjoyed World War Z and had pretty high expectations for The Zombie Survival Guide. This book is good, but not as entertaining as World War Z. It lives up to its title as a survival guide, which shouldn't have been as much as a surprise. Oh well. This book could be used for any natural disaster in terms of preparedness. So, even though the book is about surviving zombies, it can be surprisingly helpful.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|Have had to uninstall and reinstall four times. App has had a lot of problems losing memory after a log out and completeky locks you out until you uninstall it and have to start over. Game is fun but the app problems make the headache not worth it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I give this a five star I play this for hours and hours. I play this every day on and off.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|It keeps getting better!! I can't want to buy season 5! I'm sad that the series ends with season 5 though...
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I gave this a five star because I use this camera all the time and I can put it on facebook right then.
1611761069|2.0|Skip this one.  The first 5 CD's just throw out the window as you are driving.  I am a devoted Patricia Cornwell reader, but this one is so bad it needs to avoided.  Hope her next book will atone.
B0086700CM|5.0|I gave this a five star because my husband and grandsonplay this all day if I would let them. love it
B006UKFFE0|5.0|As someone already commented - the book itself is a lean - and this is the best summary of what to expect by reading.<br />Practical and written in a simple and understandable manner, it represents true cookbook for existing and future entrepreneurs ...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is one that when you pick it up you cant put it down. I love this game very fast
0385537670|4.0|I usually don't buy books. I have very little time to read them. When I heard about 50 Shades of Grey, I assumed it was going to be the little teenage fantasy similar to the Twilight series. While the overall feel of the book was very &#34;teenagerish&#34;, it was SO HARD to put down. I read it in about five hours. I haven't been that into a book since Harry Potter first came out when I was in seventh grade. While the wording was repetitive, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a little guilty pleasure. Just don't expect it to be a literary masterpiece.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I gave this a five star because I play this all the time with my grandkids and it is a good time.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|wonderful. it works well with kindle battery last a lot longer. They should have it stander with kindles.It well worth. the money.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Loved it as I do anything that Nicholas Sparks writes. Looking forward to seeing the movie! A little predictable but that did not affect overall enjoyment of reading the book.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|When I first started reading Delirium, I felt like I was in a creative writing class with one of those professors who thinks they're brilliant but comes up with stupid idea after stupid idea. In this case, the class was assigned a particularly stupid backstory (Imagine a world in which LOVE is considered a disease and is being eradicated from society! OMG I'm so brilliant) and you think to yourself, gosh, what could I possibly do with such an unbelievably stupid premise? But then you hear what Lauren Oliver writes and you think, still a stupid premise, but wow! Someone almost (ALMOST) makes it work!<br /><br />Eventually, it occurred to me that it was just another classic dystopian idea - find a way to control the masses. Remove love, and you remove passion and resistance. So, okay. I get that. But still....I need my dystopia to make a little more sense than this. A good dystopian novel has to have an element of realism to it. You have to believe something like this could actually happen. (On a side note, this is the same reason I hated Atlas Shrugged. I may not have total faith in humanity, but the collective stupidity in both these novels is just more than I can fathom.)<br /><br />Like other reviewers said, it's a bit slow, and a bit hard to care much about the characters. But her writing is beautiful, and she does the best she could possibly do with the juvenile premise. And since it is a teen book, I could see a teenager getting a lot more out of it than I did. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it either.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Just a good read with twists and turns that you don't expect. Not typical John Grisham and I liked that.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I saw the first and second season of the game of thrones. I was surprised. On some of the charactures. The ones still survived the ones betrayed people they knew. The ones who gave their all and was basically frown away. Like they did nothing. To people pretender they were heroes of the hour. And got glorries, the power. Several people who never been in power. They treat others like their nothing or worthness. Their twists and turnes in the show. Which gets you guesting on what going on. Their are people try to hold the society together. And other to turn it diciatorship.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Just did not enjoy as much as DeMille's other books and I have read them all. Earlier works like Plum Island were a better read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is a lot of fun and next update I hope the creators at mojang will make gold/butter easier 2find and plz add cave systems
B006LSZECO|4.0|Completely caught me off guard. Not predictable at all. A good read and one that is not easy to put down.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I found the book entertaining about the hike and somewhat boring about her journey to find herself through out hte journey.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a really well done spinoff of where's my water. I love Agent P and am glad he got his own game!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 is almost as good as Season 1.  Loved getting to know those persons below the stairs much better.  Said a sad farewell to two beloved family members upstairs.  This season will not disappoint.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|It stayed with action you would expect in the Bourne movies. I would recommend it for the action. Three ending faded a little and abruptly came to a close. Otherwise, I really enjoyed the action and locations it took you.
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|No explanation needed, This album is a souped upped version of the original which was a great album, unique sound, great lyrics
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can see this series going on for years !!!!! What a fantastically written show , with characters you love !
B0013DC5B0|5.0|Definitely not for kids but at the same time funny with great music, Jack Black has proven himself along with Kyle Gas as great musicians with a flavor of humor!!!!!!
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I love Ms. Knightly as an actress..n Jude Law as actor.<br />.wonderful ..if they were nor in the film..i wouldn't have watched it..due to the odd nature if film.. but well played by them as well aa a few added actresses/actors..
0393327655|5.0|Very insightful book, on how the moderate people in religions keep the fanatic nuts fired up and around. I wish every person of faith would read it, so they might get a clue.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|This is an outstanding value for such high quality music.In my opinion Philips always had a great list of artists and great technical ability in the recording of music.Their vinyl releases were top notch with great pressings and quite background.These cd,s will not disappoint .
034580404X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy and would recomend them. i also bought a set for a friend.<br />In a word..Brilliant!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a really great game. Great Graphics. Reminds you of taking care of an actual horse! It's worth it. I love it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I never realized how much I needed a valet or a footman until this show!  Great Britain story! Great performances and stunning twists!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Pure joy...sorry to see it end!  Characters were so lovable and costumes great! BBC does a great job on these period pieces.
B0027Z5DM6|1.0|Ok, so Sandler is an architect that apparently is the second-in-command at an architecture firm, who designs buildings and reports to the boss on the most important jobs? Why is it that he drives an old Impala, his kids don't have any nice toys, despite the fact that they live in a decent house, next to people that do have money? Then he lives his life like some dude that lives in his mom's basement. Look at his wardrobe in much of the movie. It's like he's wearing his personal lounge clothes in the film! Sandler is just a nasty, slovenly guy who wouldn't be making movies today if he didn't have so much control over his own productions. He's an unfunny bum that exists only to get his sad ex-SNL cast mates work. Sandler is stuck in the early 90's and surrounded by sycophants that won't let him understand what reality is. I feel sorry for the guy. I really can't understand how his films still make money. Click was just awful.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show, makes you wander how we would handle worldwide disaster. They kill off characters quickly so hard to get to liking one then they are gone
B000F1IQNM|5.0|What fun!  It was like Mary Poppins walked onto the set of the Cat in the Hat.  Emma Thompson wrote a great story and acted superbly
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app, I like to listen to a local AM show but since I work inside a building with no windows close by, this makes it possible to hear it without static. I do have issues with it having to re-buffer but it is tolerable.
B000002UAX|5.0|A great album from the past--the Beatles, with a lot of fun for the nostalgic-minded.  And yes, it was before Wings
B000JML90Y|4.0|I had never before read any of Darwin's works.  Now that I have, I find I have a greater respect for the theories that he espoused.  I found it extremely interesting, if a little tedious.<br />I recommend this bok if you want to know what Darwin is all about.
0783240287|5.0|Great job of translating this from stage for viewing and Donny's mellow voice is such a pleasure to listen to
B0011UBDTK|3.0|I purchases this for my daughter for christmas.  Unfortunately, two CDs are completely useless.  They continuously freeze and will not allow to fastforward through it.  So, we sent it back.  The exchange process was incredibly easy and convenient.  But, unfortunately, the new set of CDs are exactly the same and have the EXACT problems--same two CDs are useless.  We have decided not to return again since she loves the set.  I am very disappointed and wish that the exchange would have worked.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's like all those Facebook games like farmville and castleville expect you don't need friends to send you anything!!! I give it 5 stars fed one the best free games out there
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|Purchased this for my grandchildren and it is very hard to navigate and play this game. purchased the full version to unlock  all levels and it is stil locked.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Sometimes when the Kindle is propped up for viewing the bottom of it will slide out towards you and lie flat. The inside of the case needs some kind of traction for grip.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome endless running game!!!!a great way to spend some extra time. Keeps everyone busy around here on rainy Or snowy days.
B0000549B0|5.0|The picture quality AND sound quality on this DVD are excellent, not to mention the fact that this is one of the best movies of all time.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I don't like this game because it is very difficult to get the full puzzle completed even for the easiest ones
B005OHSD3A|5.0|This gives me the details on how to manage a low carb lifestyle.  It has the medical impact information which is important to me.  It lines up with things my physician has recommended and it is an easy reference to review periodically.
B000FC10MU|4.0|I really enjoyed the story, especially the main charater and Odin, who is a contemporary grifter. It is a great fantasy journey through the modern landscape of America.  The wife's journey is a secondary story, but equally compelling. Imaginative made-up contemporary gods, some cool, some a little silly, and that's where the book fell a little for me. The last battle between the gods, with the surviving old gods present, seemed a little odd or weird, (but not in a good way in my head as I read it).  But that may just be me, not the story.  It is definately worth reading if you like fanstasy in a modern setting, you will like and cheer for the aloof main character.
B00633W614|5.0|It was a good twister and kept my attention all the way to the end. I plan to get more Archer books.
1612931103|4.0|I've read several books lately by best-selling authors who should have read this book.  It would have helped them immensely.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|You'll come up with several possible endings to this tale about halfway through the book; the problem is, one of them is probably correct. So I wouldn't call this story a brilliantly constructed shocker - and the way Landay writes about women is clichéd and repetitive - but you will be entertained.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Add 5.1 audio instead of 2.0 and you have 5 stars. Otherwise the video quality was top notch, not 1080P but dvd quality. For those of you who do not have a home theater system that can use the 5.1 audio then it's 5 stars.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The literary prose was intriguing  I highlighted quite a lot while reading it.
B00633W614|5.0|Mr Archer did an excellent job of showing the power of loving intervention to right the consequences of the sins.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I still don´t understand why some critics say her music is boring. Her songs are good and she writes them!! unlike some other young stars... And her voice is amazing.
B007R0WHMK|1.0|I am ashamed I watched this through to the end. what a worthless, horrible movie.  avoid it.  Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman should be ashamed.
0547848412|1.0|'Life Of Pi' is very much like the fictional novel 'Amelior' in Martin Amis's 'The Information': half-baked, ethically unsound, and bewilderingly popular. It's not only terribly written and unspeakably dull, it manages to inspire dullness in others. With very few changes, 'Life Of Pi' would probably make a half-decent children's book for precocious but lonely first or second graders; kids probably wouldn't mind or understand that the book's plot was plagiarized or that the central ideas are, well, infantile. Supposedly literate adults who rave about this book's supposed 'spirituality' or 'depth' or 'amazingness' clearly have no idea what they're talking about and should be judged accordingly. Life is exactly a million times too short for this kind of pseudo-intellectual, pseudo-philosophical bunk and the reaction to Martel's unreadable follow-up made abundantly clear what should have been obvious from the opening chapter of 'Life Of Pi': Martel can't write.
0062238868|5.0|Chris Kyle has been tagged a 'hero' and he's the 1st to say no way, just doin my job.<br />his autobiography is very down-to-earth about his background, training and experiences as<br />an &#34;American Sniper&#34;.  I imagine most of our American Snipers serve and sacrifice as he did!
0380789035|5.0|This book looks exactly like the picture and comes how it is described. I like Neil Gaiman and I like this book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed the story and had figured out some of the story line.  Parts of the story were a surprise.  It was easy reading.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Catchy and fun, I couldn´t stop listening to them over and over for some days. The lead singer has such a rich voice.
B009VYAVTG|5.0|Love the entire series, hope more are coming out.  Very entertaining action adventure, for those who enjoy the King Arthur type stories.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is a first class thrill ride that will leave you wanting more.  If this is not a major motion picture there is no justice.  Long live  John Grisham.
B004I744AS|5.0|I've tried several dictionaries, both paid and free and this is the best by far. Very easy to use and is extremely comprehensive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great. It's not like those other crappy fake games (they are HORRIBLE !) because this is actually mojang making it. It's worth your money. I have it on a kindle fire and it works great. But I still wish they made it have more items and bigger worlds.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|Writing seemed contrived; shifts in time and perspective seemed like techniques. I found myself coming back to the writer's technical process in shifting voices and this detracted from falling into the story.<br />But a good original story did lurk underneath.
B0095J0AL6|4.0|It´s pop. It´s a boy band. Nothing new but they are fun and their voices are ok in the album.
B008I34ZFW|5.0|A great grade B flick!  This was about as cheesy as you can get and still be a fun movie. Well done.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I read this book approximately twenty years ago and it still is one of my favorite reads. The descriptiveness of the time period and the vast differences between the Japanese and Dutch societies. If you are a fan of history and a story line that moves swiftly This book is for you.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I think Daniel Craig is fabulous, perhaps the best and most real 007 in the midst of such impossible situations he finds himself in...<br />Looking forward to M's replacement, Dench was also an outstanding performer, but she has the right to enjoy a quite retirement.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|great! unpredictable ending, How he tells a story in one day is remarkable.<br />Can't wait for his next book to come out
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Loved the performance throughout. Hated the album cover. Cheap, sleazy. Whoever suggested this pose and costume was an idiot. Maybe it was Krall. As to the music and her performance, as usual, grand!
1439156816|5.0|I really like King´s books though I often hate how he ends them. This one, however, has one of his best endings. I am not sure if it helped me with my writing but it was a great reading about how an author feels about his work. Highly recommended.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Great book<br /><br />I will make sure that I lend this book to as many people as I can see reading this
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Very satisfied with this charger. It charges all my devises without any problems and has rather small size, that you can throw in backpack or messenger and forget about it. My devises: Nokia 603, Contour ROAM2 cam, Cygolite Expilion 350 bike light, even my wireless Logitech Performance Mouse MX. Moreover, Astro2 is charging from 220v via AC power supply, that comes with my logitech mouse. Excellent!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book shows precisely how uncool some rock stars can be.  I never would have guessed how depressed Nikki Sixx could possibly be.  How can someone have it all and still not be happy?  I can't wait until his next book.
1423129652|5.0|This was a gift for my grandson. He had requested it and after reading said it was a really good book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved this show. I am hooked!  It was the best I have seen on years. Had no idea Britain was creating such quality.
1400031524|4.0|I read other book from the series before and by The Dogs of Riga I was already used to the pace of Mankell`s stories. This one, though, was more interesting than the rest.
0765348276|4.0|We read this for my science-fiction book club this month.  Scalzi’s Old Man’s War continues the tradition of adventure space war novels in line with Heinlein’s Starship Troopers, Haaldeman’s Forever War, and Deitz’s The Legion.  Humankind needs defending, and our main character will be launched into space to do it.  Hoo-wah.  A few thoughts:<br /><br />  - I can’t help but wonder if Scalzi was inspired by Al Franken.  In Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot, Al Franken has a chapter in which he suggests two “uses” for old people that would also help solve the social security crisis.  First, he suggests that we make them soldiers; second, he urges NASA to use them for space exploration.  It’s satire.  Scalzi’s book combines both premises.  (Dang it, this guy also noticed the Franken/Scalzi connection, but doesn’t seem to know about Franken’s book.)<br /><br />  - I liked the idea of augmented combat bodies being the only way humans can compete with the multitude of monsters out there.  Also, kitty-cat eyes and green skin.<br /><br />  - I also thought it was funny that the first thing all the old folks do when transferred into young bodies is to sex it up for a week.  Of course that’s what they would do — they know how to party.<br /><br />  - Most interesting to me is the way Scalzi quickly does away with the Star Trek view of the universe.  In order to expand, we humans need to fight for every inch of every colony we can get on these other planets, mostly with species just as violent and expansionary as us.  It’s a view of nature red in tooth and claw.<br /><br />A great book in the tradition of space war adventures.  Not a stunning literary achievement, but fun to read and well worth your time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so addicting it is a great gamd! I have had it a while but i have enjoyed every minute i played oon it

B000001ELF|5.0|greataccording to my son. it was a gift to him. He asked for it so was happy with it, It was a replacement for one lost.
B001EN71CW|4.0|The image on Blu-ray is a little soft compared to more recent shows because of the way it was shot, but the picture and sound are still miles better than the standard DVDs. Totally worth the upgrade.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I started watching it a year after it ended. And thought I was not going to like it because I am a huge fan of the original. But I loved it, the acting is very good, the script is excellent.
B009O2XY12|1.0|if you like the bubble shoot games this is a poor one.  like you can get 3 stars for a level which I got but it only gave me 2. don't bother even thinking about getting it
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Do you really need a review?<br /><br />Not as good as 'The Dark Knight', but still worth watching more than once. Besides, I wanted the trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome time waster. freezes up some. wont load once you exit. overall fun but needs to be tweeked.<br />bbbbb Bobby bb bb b. b. bb b.

B001UN1KVE|5.0|Mel Brooks is always a good bet! The blu-ray picture is beautiful, tho it does make the old special effects a little noticeable. But it never stops being funny. May the Schwartz be with you!
0316228532|4.0|It took me weeks to read. The book has a slow slow start but after the first chapters the story and the characters are appealing. JK is an amazing writes, but I often felt in this book she overdescribed things that were not interesting and didn`t bring anything to the story.
B008220BLG|5.0|Best zombie movie I have seen in a long time. It had everything from drama, romance and action and best of all Zombies...
1616550414|5.0|I just loved it. A true fan of the Legend of Zelda franchise must get it. A unique piece of collection.
1423154525|5.0|Good continuation of this story! This and &#34;The Lost Hero&#34; were not what I expected but were very well written!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I'm not generally a fan of survival stories, but this book was intelligent and very compelling, far beyond its survivalist appeal.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Love this movie! Great writing. Great cast. Great effects. Blu-ray quality is fantastic! Really, what else is there to say?
1607066017|5.0|Very good charachters, good story and good humor. Even if the topics are common, the story is very original. Can´t wait for the next!

B004PYD77K|1.0|This is a region 2 DVD it wont play in the USA! The movie is great only on Region 1!
B007IK44CK|4.0|Great movie and they did it without fowl Language and nudity which seems hard these days for Hollywood to do.  A great piece of work! I was very impressed by all the stunts and action...will watch this a few more times!
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I'm not that familiar with the comics, but I really enjoy the movie. The CGI is gorgeous, the fight scenes rock. It's just a fun movie to watch.
0823015017|4.0|This is a beautiful book with many interesting tips and tutorials.  As a beginner to polymer clay artwork, I know that I will use this book many times to help me develop my color eye.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is Great Game for all ages! Even my 5 year old likes to play it! We really like it!!!
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|So excited that I found this series! Have watched Supernatural, X-Files, & Eureka and feel like it is a good combo of these-love it do far! I plan to watch the other seasons
B00BHMEALA|3.0|Of the Oscar nominees I have seen, this one is the most entertaining although its also the least ambitious on account of the fact that its pretty much a suspense-thriller. The film is a highly fictionalized version of a real-life hostage rescue operation that allows Affleck to direct himself playing a hero. Its like a really good television drama like Raid on Entebbe (1976) but with slighly higher production values and an excellent soundtrack (Stones, Van Halen, Led Zep). I think it wants to be Dog Day Afternoon or All the Presidents Men but neither the characters nor any of their individual stories are particularly interesting, the gimmicky operation (a cheesy space epic with an Orientalist twist) is the star of the film. Affleck doesn't act so much as play straight man to zany John Goodman and zanier Alan Arkin (who really provide much of the entertainment value). The film succeeds at capturing the time period (by seamlessly joining historical and pseudo-historical footage of the actual revolution and storming of the embassy), and it succeeds in manufacturing just the right amount of suspense to keep viewers on the edge of their seats without wearing them out with too much political complication. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Lincoln. Its a perfectly competent film about a very outlandish CIA operation but it doesn't try to make any kind of comment on terrorism. Hence, its the perfect antidote to Zero Dark Thirty. Its the perfect film for people tired of politics and of thinking (if the film wins Best Pic on Sunday, its probably because thats the mood of the country right now). But if you want an even better film about terrorism in the Seventies, I'd recommend the award-winning HBO miniseries Carlos (Olivier Assayas, 2010).
B001KOFH2G|4.0|The image on Blu-ray is a little soft compared to more recent movies because of the way it was shot, but the picture and sound are still miles better than the standard DVDs. Totally worth the upgrade.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|Two days after I bought this case, my son bumped it off my nightstand and it shattered.  Prior to that people complained they couldn't hear me during phone calls.  Bought an Otterbox instead.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|I love this game and I think it teaches you how to realistically take care of a horse. And for a free app this has outstanding graphics!
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great movie, saw it in the theater, great way to spend a couple hours and not worry about anything else.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|HAD TO INSTALL IT TO USE OTHER APP AND. IT DID THR JOB.  CAN'T GO WRONG WHEN IT'S SO CHEAP
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. was made for this role. It's clever, funny, and there's tons of action. A great start to the series.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|If you want a game that's well-thought out, aside from the nice graphics , then you'll appreciate this game. Controls take some getting used to but you'll shortly get there. Once you go through the birth-pang aches , (good games will have that), you won't want to put it away.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Its Downton Abbey, a PBS series. You will not go wrong in purchasig this. My wife loves it. The DVD is quality made.

B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Who would have guessed that Eric still had it in him to record an album of such high quality?  True, Eric has been performing well in concert venues and he has released some ok, but rather retro albums. But THIS release is just outstanding! Easily one of the best CDs so far in 2013. An excellent choice of backing musicians----Johnny Lee Schell on guitar toured with Bonnie Raitt, Jon Cleary on keyboards really gets it, oh heck all the musicians are playing at their highest level of skill and empathy. Every track is good. A mix of rockers and soulful tunes. Eric's songwriting is both timeless and contemporary. The track Bo Diddley Special has a wonderful Little Feat like groove and the closing blues cover is about as perfect as possibly could be. Eric, YOU are the [good] Medicine Man! I have been healed.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.the puzzles were tricky but not frustrating.I always like g5e games.thank you for another great game.

B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|Horrible movie with a laughable ending. It's also one of the most boring movies I've ever watched. Same scares from the other 3 movies. Horrible acting. Spoiler alert, the parents don't believe the girl the house is haunted even though she has video proof. It's so lame.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|100% awesome falling skys is sweet prime is awesome i love the service wouldnt change it its the best thing ever
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|The label on the front says it has the song &#34;fade into you&#34; my favorite song on the show, it is not on the cd even tho the label says otherwise. Whoever put on the packaging label and sticker- it was false advertising..
0060930349|5.0|This book most a MUST for anyone living in the United State of America. The author, a fantastic Hystorian, present the changes of the nation in a natural way. All the important issues in each moment are well presented.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I love g5e games.4.99 does seem like a lot but the games are always worth it.I paid up to 39.99 for games for my Nintendo games...so 4.99 is a deal.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I bought this book not knowing if I was that interested in this era.  The author brought history alive, telling the story from the perspectives of the British, Americans, Germans and Russians.  He also enlightened me about the politics of the times and the reasons that World War I occurred.  I couldn't put it down.  Compelling read.
B002RI9TB4|5.0|I guess I was rather ignorant of the true horrors of the Nigerian war and the author certainly brought this to life for me. Following the strands of the families added such a personal touch.I did not fully appreciate the high degree of suffering the Biafran people experienced an how callous many of the army were to their own people.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|Special effects were good, but storyline got very predictable. It should have finished with a view of the changed future.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is so fun! There are tons of things to do and there's hours of gameplay. As you rank up you unlock new towers and upgrades! Plus there's tons of new game modes and features! So get this game and you will be happy!!
B005LAII12|3.0|Bought this for my husband for our anniversary and was quite excited to see it, it was cute... very funny as well but was expecting more raw humor then an actual emotional plot that killed my nice laugh I had through the movie. Don't get me wrong the funny parts will make you giggle and squirm with glee just the emotional parts are like noooooooooooo! Whyyyyyyyyyy!? But I did enjoy it, just wasn't what all I expected. I would say we would watch it again and we might, but its been 3 months and still sitting on the self. Maybe would of been better to try redbox first.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I really loved this book ever since I down loaded it I couldn't put my kindle down.All I can say is that I really liked this book
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this Mahjong game.  This game is very easy to play.  I love the coloful tiles and the designs as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book it was so great I couldn't put the book down now onto mockingjay it's a great book for kids also
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Nice movie...thought ending was tough, but it was a good twist ending. Would like to have seen how things changed in the future based on the ending.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I am enjoying reading this series. Particularly since I'm such a fan of the show! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys the Castle  series.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I enjoyed &#34;Gone Girl&#34; but I felt that this book is better. It kept me entirely riveted to the very end.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It wasn't what I expected. They were both more than a little warped!  Don't know who I would recommend this to
B008B1VYP0|3.0|I adore Maroon 5 & have listened to their prior albums from start to finish & have always loved every song. This is the first album that I actually skip songs because I just can't listen to them. I bought the whole album before even listening to the samples of the songs because I was sure I would love them. However, I was so disappointed. There are a few redeeming songs but this is one album that I would pick & choose songs rather than buying the whole album.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I had an impression of this novel before reading it based on the TV ads for the movie.  What a pleasant surprise!  The novel had more depth and twists than I would have thought.  One of the better books I have read in a while.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Interesting story line...Liam Neeson had a great performance as always...support acting was good and believable. It was a good action movie. Worth seeing
B009T3AHDE|5.0|I read the book some time back & while interesting, not one of my favorites. I didn't knw how this would be translated into a movie, but I did think it reflected the book well. Robert Pattinson surprised in a role as different from his Twilight character as day from night. Since he was in every scene, he showed he can carry a movie. From reading the book, I think he nailed the character.

B0081HLM2E|5.0|&#34;smart&#34; is thrown around far too often to describe movies. it's become a horrible cliche. in this case, however, it's overwhelmingly deserved. the film is full of delight and suspense. somehow, i feel like i could watch it over and over again. i'm in love.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great free app.... Great free app... Great free app... Great free app... Works great. No complaints! Recommended to kindle users! Thanks!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Works fine but the ads are really annoying. Would like to get rid of them. Requiring a set # of words for this review is also annoying.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Keep it coming ... Great characters .... Very believable .. Fantastic scenery and period costuming .. Looking forward to next season
B0063IH60K|5.0|I recommend this game for lots of fun and hey its free so what a deal. So go ahead and download it today.

0307949508|5.0|i'm not even done reading it, but this is the first moment i've taken to do anything else since picking it up. wow. i wish stieg larsson was still around. his writing is phenomenal.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|This was a really good movie. Gripping, intense and fast pace. The moment the movie starts, the thrill never stops. A movie about one man that's willing to get &#34;justice&#34; on those responsible for the crimes against his family and for those that let the criminals off too easy.<br />Law Abiding Citizen had good cinematography. The acting was excellent and in a sense put you in Clyde Shelton's shoes.The story and emotions you get through the main actor's character are powerful.<br />Overall, this is a movie you have to watch.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Good book. I liked how the characters developed during the course of thebook. It had a good message. I would recommend it to my friends.
B00821OX98|5.0|Noah Wyle is amazing (and he's not the same character as in E.R.), and there are a host of other one-off characters played by actors you'd recognize from other shows. All around, it's a fun watch, if you're into this sort of thing. A friend of mine also described it like the future in &#34;Terminator&#34; but with aliens.
B0085TKAW6|3.0|Oh dear, written by formula, so simple, nothing surprised. Such a shame, as the story could have held the reader if a bit more effort had been put in by the writer. Novel by numbers.

B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|The delivery was very prompt and the price was great.  I know this is an &#34;older movie&#34; now, but the price was good.  I just love this movie!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it! graphics are good. I use it in my therapy session to teach kids patience  and work on motor skills and hand eye coordination.
0062082353|2.0|The book was pretty boring. Strange detail to mention maybe, but the paper quality of the printed book was almost like toilet paper it was so shabby. The pages were cut or cropped and almost had a torn appearance.<br />Between the boring book and shabby quality of the paper and the printing, i would HIGHLY reccomend you dont spend more than a dollar on a used version, read through it in 1/2 a day and then throw it away.....WOW
B0036T31YY|5.0|i bought a lot of dvd and blu-ray. i mainly bought my bluray and dvd from amazon and walmart and bestbuy, last year i bought a couple of blu-ray from amazon. amazon said it is brand new, but i am hundred percent positive it is not, i highly suspect amazon sold some used blu ray or dvd as brand new. before i bought this blu ray i was kind of suspicious, but this one turned out to be really brand new. i am pretty happy. i guess i have to keep trusting amazon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Addicted to this show, so glad I found it on Amazon to rent. My DVR did not record episodes 7 & 8.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this game is nice but l can not get 5000 but I don't think that this game is bad enough for you to said that this game is bad for you to do so I think that you should get the game and I think that this game is nice to buy or get the game.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Good stuff...<br />Buy this movie<br />Buy the music<br />Buy a light cycle<br />Buy a new tv to watch it on
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|I got this movie for movie night with my 6 yr old granddaughter. In about the middle of the movie she said it was freaking her out and that we should find another movie.<br />As for myself I liked it and continued to watch it the next day by myself.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|THIS YOUTUBE DOWNLOADER IS SUPERB . ITS ALSO NOT A GIMMICK LIKE SO MANY OTHERS . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . THANK YOU .
B008D30K7E|5.0|I loved the book.  Read it. I have nothing more to say but the review requires more to publish it.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a sweet story of two people who lacked the love of a father. This has some very cute moments and shows how they work through their trust issues. Very nice story.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|Surely Mr Fellowes has other things he can do besides killing people on Downton Abbey?  The ending for season 3 makes me not want to watch this series.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Highly recommend this book.  Especially if you can watch the movie later :)  Will be buying the entire set as soon as possible.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I really liked Rowling's portrayal of the complexity and sadness of poverty and drug addiction and its influence that lasts for generations.
B008GANNIC|5.0|have always been a P.O.D. fan.  Love this cd and song selection.  would recommend to others.  great beats.  ! !
B005LAIISU|5.0|This was a great buy. This was a gift for my children, they love the Ice Age movies. This made a great addition to our collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is good because it's fun and really colourful and its quit addicting because if you want a character you need to play and get coins for them
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The following review is for Kindle Fire:<br /><br />PROS:<br />  *Great graphics<br />  *Just scary enough<br />  *Game moves at as quick of a pace as you move when solving puzzles<br />  *Unique way to see your \\"gathered evidence\\"<br />  *Puzzles are sometimes tricky but, not frustrating<br />  *Storyline is excellent<br />  *Good value for the price<br /><br />CONS:<br />  *Download took approximately 30-40 minutes.<br />  *Installation of application is took about 1 1/2 hours.<br />  *I don't have a whole lot of data on my Kindle Fire & it still took an outrageous amount of time to both download &<br />  install.<br /><br />All & all, I recommend this game. If you are going to purchase it, leave your Kindle hooked up and do anything else! Waiting for anything to download and/or install is worse than waiting for water to boil! :0) I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars overall. Just based on he download/install time. The game itself is 5 out of 5 stars!
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|A strong cast of actors with a working together attitude.  The movie is full of violence, action, and savage, beastly behavior.  If you want blood and guts with a female lead, grab Savages and your gloves.  The main two guys (friends and in love with O, the same girl for both) and a Mexican Mama make the scene real by being in the home grown industry of the leaf.  The two guys make the best smoke anywhere in the world and some major moves are being put on them to &#34;join&#34; the big boss.  Grab it and see what happens to these players.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love this game but they won't let me get anymore habitats. I have enough money and room. Not saying I do't like the game! I love it!  But I'm getting very annoyed! Still u should try the game maybe it won't happiness to u!I have a Kindle.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|It was a very interesting DVD. The Royal Albert Hall is incredible and the fact that it was an Anniversary Edition made it more interesting. I was surprised that the Singers just stood there in front of microphones rather than actually acting out the parts. The movie which is up for an Oscar was much more realistic and I loved the movie! The Music is lovely!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is really awesome. I have a hard time putting it down. The zip lines and rides through the mines are amazing.
B004LROUNG|2.0|Boring as hell.  I can't believe how bad this book is.  The author has done much better books on tort law.  Someone should pay me for reading it.
B00973DDN2|5.0|The Killers are one of my favorite bands. I have all their other albums. This album is great. If you are a killers fan you will love it.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Watch the live performance on NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts series (video), it made me a fan of Macklemore and his lyrical style and energy. Rap for people who like relevant lyrics and cool beats, it will entertain and give you food for thought.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|really good when trying to look up a book or any other item that one may be interested in. Thanks
B007REV4T8|2.0|Skyfall is a dud, just an overblown letdown. Some of the performances are good but the script's weak and the plot's dumb. Javier Bardem makes the most of his demented villain role but the writing is awfully thin (with the exception of \\"the last two rats alive\\" monologue.) In his characters obsession with wanting to kill \\"M\\" (Judi Dench) he simply goes to ridiculous lengths - with pre-arranged elaborate escape routes for any impossible contingency Surely there must be more interesting ways to introduce Ralph Fiennes into the franchise. Albert Finney is an after thought (which was really depressing to watch) as the shotgun-toting grounds keeper. Really!?! Couldn't they have found something else for him to do here? Daniel Craig is still wonderful as Bond (but where are the beautiful Bond women?) Sam Mendes' technical work is fine but he's given us a Bond movie that missed the mark on so many levels.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|This game is addicting. It's a great way to pass some time. I only wish I could sync it with my Droid phone.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great book.  As usual lots of twists and turns, would love to read another about Pendergrast.  Can't wait to read another.
0765325950|5.0|A fitting end or should I say beginning to the wheel of time. I would recommend this book and series to any and every one. What a ride!
B009MFKO3M|5.0|I dig the sound, it is refreshing and unconventional but still accessible. It is music that inspires people to talk about psychedelic soundscapes wrapped in good songwriting, and will engage the critics to diss it for its flaws of \\"weak\\" song structures and repetitiveness. \\"Fleet Foxes under the influence trying to cover The Doors\\".
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it and enjoy it. My grandaughter enjoys playing it and will have lots of fun on our trip next week.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|super fun!!! if u like horses then you'll love this! having a blast playing this. can't wait to get a zebra! after that a unicorn!
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|We had the little circle going during the entire film.  It was very distracting.  Tried everything to get it to go away but could not.  Internet was working fine for Netflix and all others, so I suspect it was Amazon or the Film.  Not sure.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This story was a little weak.  There was not a lot of mystery to it but as always Sparks gives us great detail about the location, which I love since I'm from NC.
B0031R5K8G|5.0|So beautiful, no further comments required. Felt in love with the little boy. A great job, seriously. Blah blah blah (word count requirement)
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I have a June 2012 Macbook Air, and I wanted to use the USB port for wired ethernet to free up the Thunderbolt port for use with a display adapter. I considered buying the Apple brand USB &#62; Wired Ethernet adapter, but read mixed reviews, so I decided to look elsewhere.<br /><br />After reading the reviews of the Anker Adapter, I figured I'd give it a shot. I couldn't be happier. Device ships with miniature CD with drivers, and I simply copied drivers to USB thumb drive (since Macbook Air doesn't have a CD/DVD drive), installed drivers, connected adapter and it immediately worked as expected. Since the adapter is USB 3.0, I get the maximum speed that my gigabit ethernet connection offers.<br /><br />I recommend this product with 100% confidence.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love it and can not express in words how much. Think my favorite so far is &#34;Not a Sparrow Falls&#34;
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I read this first Reacher book out of order but it didn't matter. Reacher has an impact on anyone who gets this book. Your hooked from the first page.
B0080MPUUK|5.0|What can I say?  If you love Woody Allen, you will love this film.  Probably not the best for everyone but fans will be happy at the end.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great book and, given current circumstances with Chine and their hacking, very timely. And I love that the younger Ryan is getting the action his Dad used to.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I absolutely love Robert Downey Jr in this film.  Get both films, it's a wonderful way to spend a weekend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv zis gome so much I vant ta ate ite uhhhhh um I do net now vat else to zay
B007IK44CK|4.0|this time cruise did a good job. The good thing about his movies is you know what to expect good action, humor and no thought required. Sit back and enjoy
0307887960|5.0|I am very pleased, the book is like brand new, The diet itself is awesome and really works if you follow it. I couldn be more pleased. I recieved the book quickly as well. I would highly recommend this book and seller.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Perfect ending to a great series...I enjoyed seeing the new president die and a world free of shackles for the characters..
B0094WK9GU|4.0|I got this cd because I fell in love with the band through the song, &#34;Don't You Worry Child&#34;. The cd line up does not match the MP3 download that you get for free though. The cd only has one version of &#34;Don't You Worry Child&#34;, whereas the MP3 download has 2. I'm disappointed about that to say the least.
1577314808|5.0|Started my long journey of meditation, If you dont know where to start and you are not sure what religion you believe, this book takes all the philosophies and targets what we are all trying to acheive, makes it aquireable.

B009FZFONO|5.0|great episode! can't wait for more to come on sunday (monday)  great definition for my 60 inch tv. I just love it
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Well worth the money, graphics are excellent, dialogs made me smile, a diifferent way in a looking for objects game. Music is a bit anoid at times but that can be easily fixed.
B0098VYKSA|5.0|nice s*** music  is definetly late in this season but son good lyrics in this song good beat by the producers and the haters
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Nice story that you could relate to in today's crazy world. I would recommend this book
B00AH69T22|5.0|You would be hard pressed to find a better heavy metal album! One of Metallicas best! If not their best!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|please write and produce more songs. it is wounderful . i liked every single song. i wish the album included all their old songs
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun you take care of beautiful horses clean them and go to competitions.  you can even have a unicorn!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed 'Gone Girl'. I love the way the book flip flopped the points of view.<br />I found the book interesting from the start, but once I hit the half way point, I couldn't put it down. Would recommend highly.
B009KHBDUU|5.0|nice vamp music  is definetly late in this season but son good lyrics in this song good beat by the producers and the haters overall its a good flick
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Sorry I waited so long to read this fabulously funny book!  Who wouldn't love this....except angry white men and probably their sappy wives...they hate everything!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed  game, but found it really easy. I beat the game in two days; wouldn't have taken that long if I hadn't bought the game so late.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it! Could not stop reading it, it was so addictive! I can't wait to read the rest of them
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead season 3 is awesome! So glad I got to watch it and catch up. Dayrl Dixon is my fav!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|As I said, it is a very practical simple cover but very protective of my Kindle Fire HD. An excellent item!!!!!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling has once again wowed the reading public with her genius...great novel.  So insightful and entertaining at the same time.  A must read.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|For once a Batman series that didn't get worse with each new episode.  I liked this one the best because it set right what went wrong in the last one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very thrilling! I couldn't put the book down! I had to read page after page! I cannot wait to continue the story
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is a Great read. The download worked seamlessly. I would recommend this book for all  people to read.
B000VS6R26|5.0|I think that Titanic is one of the best movies ever made. I cannot count the number of times I have watched it and I am captivated every time. If you are a real romantic who loves a good cry this movie is for you.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Got it as the free app of the day a while ago and have been using it often since then. I really appreciate the ease of use and options available.
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books that I have read in a long time. The story is filled with lots of twists and surpised. I'm telling all my girlfriends to get this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fascinating game.  Beautiful Horse , beautiful scenery this would definitely keep a childs attention no matter at what age.  Even grandmas will love playing this with the grandkids.  Such a beautiful moment....Time well spent...This means more than anything to a child.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Liked this Bond more than the last couple. Good Bond, Great villian! Hope that there are more to come. Will miss M.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I am really impressed with the research it took to write a book of this sort. Being a history major, the assassination of JFK fascinates me, and I think King covers it pretty well. Not a horror book, but a great book all the same.  I recommend it to all fans of history and fans of King 's writings.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This is Josh Groban so, for me, it can only be perfect. Now I am waiting for the the release of a DVD!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I fell into the story from the first chapter! This book truly is enchanting! My only complain about the book is that I feel that the ending is very abrupt. I found myself researching whether there was a second book in the works... It definitely lends itself to the possibility.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book doesn't follow the normal novel writing style. By that, I mean its not really a story per se. It's more of flash backs with many diffrent characters.<br />Some may enjoy that but I did not.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Never wanted the season to end. Can't wait to watch the next season. If you like the first season you will like this one as well.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Read the book (900 and some pages) in a week - totally kept me involved.  Can't wait for the next book in the trilogy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|57 year old married male. Tried it because of all the other rave reviews. I totally agree with them. Really addictive
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books!  Hope there will be a fourth!  The type of book you start and can't put down!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved the book now I am ready to see movie! I enjoy reading Nicholas spark books.  I recommend highly.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|gave to my son as a gift ---a BIG Dr Who fan --- great fun and he loves it alot
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Fun for a few of my kids. Can pass the time. Don't like that kids run from cops. But the juvenile graphics make it seem a little better.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I got Mysteryville 2 when it was the FAOTD. I enjoy hidden object games and had been looking for a good one. This is better than some that I've tried, and it had me hooked the first time I played it on my Kindle Fire. I don't think I would play this on my Droid 3 phone,  because the screen is too small.<br /><br />There are many types of things to search for in the puzzles. There are also some different puzzles sprinkled throughout the game, such as: finding differences in pictures, putting together a puzzle, unscrambling words, and other such games.<br /><br />I wouldn't pay $2.99 for it because I don't see me playing it a whole lot.
B005I2YL4G|5.0|Installed this in a HTPC build and was happily surprised at its performance. As far as processing power, it is not the strongest/fastest by any means. But it handles media very well and was successful at playing Borderlands with medium/high graphics settings. Very nice not having to buy a video card! Low price for a good APU!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This little app gives good information and let's you know not only how your battery is doing, but I also like the graph function that shows how fast it is discharging, and also how fast it is charging. This is helpful if the charger is not a standard full power charger. Has several nifty features.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|This book is not really worth writing a review about, but I was so disappointed by it that feel like I have to say something. Basically, the bad guy is someone whom we never care about. The ending is so abrupt without the least built build-up that you think...that's it?<br /><br />Again.....we don't care if the bad guy dies....but then, he just hangs out in a cave all day, so it's not like he's very scary.<br /><br />And then.................when the author graduated college in 1988, he got into the extremist islamic groups from visiting websites.....websites in 1988?!?!<br /><br />Stupid.<br /><br />But, I do like John Corey and I hope that Nelson Demille has at least one more good story inside of him somewhere because he's still one of my favorite authors....which just made me even more disappointed that this book sucked.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|just like the last temple run, ... just 100% better. if tu liked the last one I highly recommend this one.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved the book. Now I'm ready to watch the movie!<br />Highly recommend it! Love story in a strange twisted set up. I loved it!
0553386816|5.0|This book of short stories was full of rich tales of local folk in Mississippi towns, their individual faults, good points and bad. Often funny, it keeps you reading and wanting more.
B002BWP49C|1.0|I bought this movie because I loved the books and when the movie came out in theaters I had a newborn baby so figured I would just buy the movie and watch it at home.  I was so excited to finally see it but it skipped and wouldn't play some scenes. I was extremely disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very good you get coins faster good graphics and made it more interactive so fun I absolutely LOVE it! I recommend you download.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The story line on Shades is good, they could have left all the kinky sex stuff out. I'm more interested in the fairy tale lifestyle and Christians problems from when he was young then the sexual aspect of the book.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This completes our 007 collection. We own all of the 007 from 1954 Casino Royale with Barry Nelson as the first Bond all the way to Skyfall (we also own the Collector's Edition of Casino Royale 1967 version). We also own Never Say Never again which is NOT part of the Bond movies, but still a great movie.<br /><br />We want more! Bring on the next 007 movie! Our whole family can watch this movie and we don't have to worry about viewing things that should not be on T.V. period!<br /><br />This movie starts off with action! This movie is one of the best movies out right now. There is a good reason the Bond movies have been around for 50 years. Quality, action, pure clean fun and much more! Bond movies always have class!<br /><br />We love Daniel Craig! Our children are even bond fans and love Daniel Craig! We also have a couple of the sound tracks for some of the Bond movies and yes they are awesome as well! The soundtrack to this movie will be great as well! I even have Bond as my ring tone and alarm!<br /><br />You will love the beautiful views, action, technology, actors, plot, etc. And some may not like what happens to Bond in this movie, however I think it makes the movie more real and sets it apart.<br /><br />This Bond shows us what is going on in today's times and what can happen with technology in the wrong hands. This movie is by all means going down in history as one of the best Bonds's ever!<br /><br />This world is becoming more and more dependent on technology and many reside in a bubble meaning many think they are safe, this movie proves this point to the fullest!<br /><br />This movie has many twists and turns! This movie has a lot to offer!  With the perfect Villain! The way he eludes Bond is common with today's Villain's.<br /><br />Skyfall is a blast! This movies transitions the Bond franchise into this modern world. This Bond will have new Bond fans wanting to view the past Bonds.<br /><br />The whole cast is great and will entertain all who view this awesome movie!<br /><br />Well time for a fish fry and Bond marathon! Bond always delivers! Keeping movies as they should be! Skyfall is pure class! Thanks for keeping Bond clean, entertaining and fun! We can pass this type of entertainment on to our children.<br /><br />Ready for Bond 24! Field work at it's best! And no matter how far back in Bond movies you call, they all have class and beautiful decoration, gowns, technology etc.<br /><br />Flight and many other movies can take lessons from Bond! Good clean movies will last and have a fan base for generations! Thanks Bond! James! James Bond!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I knew I had to have this CD to add to my Whitney Houston collection!!!  I made the right decision...
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is a blast. I have had some problems with the size on my fire, but this is to be somewhat expected.
B00ARFEQ80|5.0|I have them all on steal book the art work is killer and it looks better then the normal blue ray cases
B007REV4YI|5.0|[Blu-ray] I'm not much for writing reviews about the movies I buy. I get them because I like them and I'm not into changing your mind, but for those who like 007, this movie was a just about everything you'd want to see in a classic or new Bond movie. The Blu-ray transfer was excellent and both my wife and I enjoyed it quite a bit (at the theatre once, at home - 3 times so far). I hope the next movie continues along these lines.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple calculator with big buttons and easy to use.  my go to calculator on my kindle fire. what else can you ask for?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome best game on the kindle it is my favorite it is the best game to play on the road
1451695195|5.0|Everone should read this book. It's very comforting. My husband and I have seen the author interviewed on tv and he seems to be a sincere person. His perpective as a scientist is very interesting.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|This is a truly amazing love story well written directed and acted i enjoyed all of it and haveadded it to my list of watch it again movies
B0053FANS6|5.0|this movie is so much better on blue ray the difference is huge its like watching it for the first time
B00271HAK8|5.0|&#34;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&#34; is one of those movies you can't help but watch once a year.  It's fun and light-hearted. It's going to be a classic for many years to come.
B001HIJYR4|4.0|Good. I like the product. Good actors. Good trailer. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. !!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|This movie i seen back in junior high and fell in love with it! I have been collecting movies from way back in the 30's, 40's, 50's, and 60's on. The movies today are very violent and the love stories are like tha of today's world but the way human's loved back then seems so much more genuine because morals and values were instilled in the up bringing of the children better. Along with religion being a strong foundation. This movie goes with the times so if you like musicals and plays, just a lover of art forms in various ways this is a classic! The sound was good. The picture was good and it was worth the money! I think it was actually a steal!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|searched for the best prices and service options for two new phones with good battery life.  The verizon phones on AMAZON were by far priced the lowest.  we got the phones in 3 days and phone set up simple and was instant.  i am on second day with only one full charge needed.  wonderful.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great for the Kindle, it adds that little extra personal touch. It provides all types of calculations and it saves it for future viewing.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|you see so much more now that there all on blue ray i never thought Aliens would look so good
0670867950|5.0|&#34;The Whole Story&#34; published by Viking brings the Classics to life.  The text is unabridged.  Multiple drawings and pictures of historical items are included on nearly every page.  Many of the drawings also include a a small description.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and can not wait to start the next one. The imagery was beautiful and the storyline is great.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is a great game. nearly finished it on my I phone now my kindle. so addictive. once you start playing make sure your schedule is clear.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Lincoln's dedication to the concept of this country was inspiring.  He was able to overrule his personal feelings and use the talents of others while trying to keep peace among these rivals in his cabinet.<br /><br />The story makes you want to also be a more dedicated, less selfish person.<br /><br />However, there is too much detail and it is a slow moving read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've got to say that Nick Sparks is the Best when it comes to Romance and Thrillers, I loved the book Safe Haven ! I also Loved the Book The Notebook ! I must take my wife to see Safe Haven, because it's driving me crazy not to talk about the Book. I know Nick has a new book out already, I must get it !<br />  Thank You for Great Reading Nick !<br />  D. Shadd<br />  Kentucky !
B0083GCK5G|5.0|This album will take you back 45 years for sure.  It is Beach Boys at their best and if you don't understand why Brian Wilson is considered brilliant, listen to the sounds in this album.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Okay, so Temple Run 2 is by far WAY more fun and much more challenging (in a good way) than Temple Run. Basically, it's a great game all around save for one little issue: the lag seems to be getting worse by the day. So this is moreso a simple error to be fixed hopefully by the next update, but its beginning to get on my nerves when I loose due to jerky graphics and slow responding touch commands. Please fix this.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Wowzers I  never thought I would love this series but I was immediately hooked! The last book did not disappoint
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Gave me more insight into the actual training and the dangers that the Navy Seals face.  I have a renewed appreciation of the Service they do for our Country.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it takes me back to when I cared for horses. I love horses and can't wait to get one all my own.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I liked it because it is funny.l think it is a great book to read. l love Jeff`s books very much.
B009IEXKXI|1.0|Succession of problems and solutions but not much about how a stranded guy would feel on Mars. I skipped most of the solutions after the forth problems, getting too bored reading the technical detail. Probably a cool book if you are engineer, for the rest of us it gets way too repetitive
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it has a lot of differents games n they hive me a challenge.! if you want a challenge you should get it
0446547646|1.0|This book was awful from start to finish. The writing was juvenile, the story line was predicable, the characters were shallow and the ending was completely unrealistic. I am an avid reader and have rarely come across a book I could not find any redeeming value in but this book filled those sorry shoes. I actually hated this book.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|the game was fun until it stopped working all of a sudden I try to open it then it then it went back to the home screen could someone fix this?
B0054U56B4|5.0|This was a gift for my sister-in-law who loves this series.  I've never read them but she said this book did not disapoint.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's the best. Everyone will love it. Kids , adults ,elders Everyone will love it. I love it
B005ONTD42|5.0|I've gotten a few of these I'm the last year and loved them. At first glance, it's fun.. But what are going to do with a robot ball? Until you realize it's fully programmable via the Macro Lab app. You can make it roll, change direction, change color, and go nuts. This works really well in educational environments for kids because there's nothing cooler than making things move.<br /><br />Then you realize that it does have to just be an output device controlled by a phone or iPad.. You can you the Sphero as the controller. Last Fish (controlling a fish on the screen using the Sphero) is a simple game at first.
B008S4YZCO|1.0|the monsters prices were outrageous a single monster that wasn't even very good costed 1600 hearts (you earn these by having neighbors and only can get 5 hearts per visit) I would say this a game for people that have LOTS of friends that play this
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This  is the most awesome game ever a think every person should get this game it's so awesome and cool
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this was the best in the whole series.i cant wait for the 8th book . i give it a 5 star rating. reveiw from brendan hoke.
B0076DELIG|4.0|If you like Michael Connelly  you will like this one. It is a tight well written mystery. It kept me turning pages. Hard to stop reading
B00003JRCQ|4.0|This movie proves that sometimes life does have a happy ending.  Love wins and they can &#34;live happily ever after.&#34;
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|It's a future where basically everything has crashed economically and life, education, and escape are provided by a Matrix-like space. Early on the Quest is introduced where ownership of basically everything will be given to the one who solves it. There are some excellent twists and turns and a few parts that were just simply entertaining.<br /><br />The parts that annoyed me were that much of it felt like fawning love of the 80's culture, media, etc. it was really well done in some parts, but every little thing got old after a while.<br /><br />Regardless, the underlying story and characters are pretty good.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|THIS GAME STINKS! If you ever see this game AVOID it and go and play minecraft because it is BETTER bigtime
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Bought for my son never seen an can't find in stores anymore so good deal for blue ray loves movie an pop toys that we got him to go with it
0897502027|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my husband, (though I have flipped through it) he loves this book and it was shipped quickly.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Very good love story, might be better as movie.  Some parts were described in detail  a little too much, which made it seem long and drawn out.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Of the five movies I purchased, this is definitely my favorite.  Had seen this one prior to purchase and still enjoy it.  Will be watched again and again!  Absolutely beautiful!
B001992NUQ|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this film? Nothing! and why is that? Because this film is still great, and is now commonly known as a cult classic.<br /><br /> From 1999 to 2013 I've had to have seen this film at least 30 times. I kept re-watching this because there are so many quick hidden elements to this film. for Example, Do you know how many times Tyler Durden flashes in front of the screen before we are introduced to him on the plane? Well, I'm not telling you because it was fun re-watching and counting for myself.<br /><br /> The movie is still watchable and the movie has stood the test of time. While watching this film it's really hard to believe this is a 14 year old film. So enough drooling over the film itself, lets shift focus to the 10th Anniversary Blu-ray version.<br /><br /> I've seen this in theaters, watched on VHS, Owned it on DVD, and now the blu-ray. The blu-ray version tops all formats in visual quality. The blu-ray Special Features are fantastic but, they are the same quality as the features from the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD that came out years ago. I think that they should have re-vamped all of the Bonus content in HD. That's my only complaint and that complaint isn't strong enough not to give a 5 Star rating.<br /><br /> If this is your first time watching this film I think you will enjoy it. I recommend this to everybody and I will watch this with my future children and hopefully my Grand children as well.
B007N8RULO|3.0|It's a good time passer. Very hard to ever win a game tho. But it's free, so that makes it worth it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|A real page-turner.  Kept me guessing throughout and pondering the nature and mystery of memory and how it makes us human.  Recommended.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It really fun to play with .Love this game so much .I wish I can play with it<br />This was my first game I bought on my kindle and favorite game.
B005GRF2UK|4.0|This movie starts a little slow and is confusing in some places, but all in all a very enjoyable  movie!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Although the middle got a little slow, I fully enjoyed this book. I never had a clue about the complexities of Steve Jobs. And  the history of the company and industry is great food for thought in your own career.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was a very moving story, that was beautifully portrayed by each of the actors. You really felt they were the actual people whose live story was being told.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|Not my cup-o-tea, although I can see why others may find it appealing... I guess I just need something a little more challenging, & alot less 'Goo'ey. :^)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and entertaining for me and my friends hope that they come out with a Subway Sitters two/2
0800141660|5.0|Love this movie!  Although sometimes romance takes a detour, this is a beautiful love story and a very enjoyable movie.
B000001EGE|5.0|My husband was very happy with this Christmas present.  It has the songs that he remembers from so long ago.
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|At first the Instant Video would not play at all and the audio could only be adjusted down, but a call for help resulted in a 4 star response from Amazon, a young woman who was the most helpful, competent, patient, understanding assistant ever locally or nationwide in many fields including personal health care.
B000OVLINI|4.0|I think the beginning of this book was hard to follow. There were so many places, areas, houses, etc., that all had names I found it a bit confusing. Don't give up because it does come together at the end and then makes perfect sense.<br />I chose 4 stars because I do like a mystery and this book was mysterious and scary in parts.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|If you want to know how the other side looks like. A must read and who will start a world war take a look at this book
0767020308|4.0|Although matchmaking can sometimes lead to beautiful love stories, sometimes it ends in disaster.  Overall, an enjoyable and entertaining movie!
B000001DQI|5.0|My husband really enjoyed getting this as a Christmas present.  It has the songs that he remembered from long ago.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was absolutely fantastic. Green's work is always special in the way that his literature really makes you think about life and its unanswerable questions. He's one of the few authors that can have you uncontrollably crying one moment, and laughing the next. I'm only fourteen, but nonetheless, I find a lot of similarities between myself and Hazel, especially pertaining to her outlook on things. John, DFTBA.
B009AMANH4|5.0|I am anxiously awaiting the release of this DVD. The movie was accurate to a fault, but leave it to Spielberg to go to the extent of using the sound of the actual doors opening of the real courthouse in the story , of the creaking sounds of the actual floor creaking, and even the sound of a person as they stood from the pew where Lincoln actually sat in real life and putting these sounds into the film. Daniel Day Lewis was superb but he seems to like to play roles in historical movies (The Last of the Mohicans), and although I have never been a strong Sally Fields fan her personality flaws as Mary Todd Lincoln seemed totally believable. As an added plus I thought it was tasteful not to go into much detail of the assassination itself, it is almost as if the movie was really focused on the emancipation itself with Lincoln's death marking the end of that period in history. Soundtracks don't often catch my attention but even that seemed to fit the mood of the moment beautifully. I truly hope others enjoyed this movie half as much ss I did.
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|This is not acceptable this app!  It is hard to take vedios and when you do get a vedio it does not let you play it back, so whats the point?
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I hadn't heard much about this film but picked it to watch with my kids, 11 and 15, over dinner one night and this little sleeper of a film was a real hit.  Plenty of funny for both ages plus me as the adult and in the end you really care about the characters.  There's a nice message about caring for others, being aware of your feelings, and not perpetuating a 'you hurt me so I'll hurt you' dynamic that you can reinforce with the kids.<br /><br />Cool enough for teens, accessible enough for middle school, and funny enough for the whole family.  Highly recommended.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Despite some of the comments, I found myself unable to stop reading. I didn't fully figure out the ending until Lydia learned the news in the orphanage. I'm very pleased with the ending, but would have liked the story to continue, through their meeting, and getting to know one another.<br />What hell they both lived through. I was so angry with that orphanage, and the so called people of God, who ran it. The unimaginable abuse, at their hands, surely bought them a ticket into hell.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I cannot get enough of this series.  I was going to go slow watching the episodes to make it last...NOPE could not do it!  before you know it an episode is done.  the magic is more -- love that!  the characters are developing so well!  what a great spin on this story that I never grow tired of!
B007REV4YI|4.0|A typical action film although the Blu ray sounds effects were wonderful. I liked the movie for what I believe it was intended to be, simply several hours of entertainment. Daniel Craig seems to be making Bond a more believable person each movie he makes. The movie is definitely fast paced with good action sequences in it, so if you can enjoy it on that level, you should enjoy it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I seldom like murder mysteries with police officers as the hero; too trite.  But I like Connelley, and am glad I gave this a try. Bosch is a well-crafted character and I look forward to what happens next with him.
B00BESNKB8|2.0|QT has jumped the shark with this one.  I'm a fan of his movies but there's really no part of this that works.  It's bad action, bad acting, and too many steps beyond the stylized violence of Kill Bill to appreciate.
0316228532|4.0|The language is rough , but I felt it was necessary for the story.  Our Book Club picked our favorite characters and discussed why we liked them , and then we discussed other characters and situations.  It made for a great discussion about life...ups and downs...good and bad, etc.  Several members did not finish it ,and one said she just could not read it at all. The rest of us thought it was a very good book.  The writing is excellent.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Easy to learn and fun for all age groups to use. See your progress as you build up your own restaurant....chain anyone?
B007THA4FI|1.0|It was a sadly boring book that left me disappointed.  I expected a much better story with better character development from her.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Ben Affleck kept his cool but of course he was a pro at rescuing people.  John Goodman provided some welcome comic relief.  My husband and I were totally engrossed in this film which is a rarity with the usual stuff coming out of Hollywood.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|I don't know what it was about this movie that my girls, ages 11 and 15, thought they wouldn't like but once we were five minutes into it, they were hooked.  I know my oldest related to the young (at age 118) daughter vampire who felt overly restricted.  The father (Dracula) was expertly animated, and the whole script had us laughing from beginning to end.<br /><br />Highly recommended, even if it's not Halloween!
B0030F5W5K|4.0|Good picture<br />Sound quality ok<br />One of the features is missing, I watched a movie the other night, I stop the movie, then the next day I wanted to watch the movie where I was left, the movie start again from the beginning, if you can fix this<br />Thank you
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is  page turner.  I couldn't put it down till the last page.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Again Sparks comes through.  He never dissappoints.
B0058YPGL6|3.0|This is a cheap knockoff of the popular shows Twilight and The Vampire Diaries. There are some actors doing a great job with a rather thin premise. Dylan O'brien is wasted as the lovable and funny best friend (seriously, why is he not on a top line show?) but Crystal Reed is completely unbelievable as the love interest of Scott McCall (Tyler). Crystal's &#34;Allison&#34; neither looks nor behaves like a teenager...she looks at least a decade older than Scott to the point I was uncomfortable watching their 'love scenes'. &#34;Allison's&#34; father is a one note character that plods thru the series with a sneer and scowl as his only form of emoting, her aunt is a cold cruel person with no apparent reason to be so.<br /><br />In addition, the show's writers apparently do not think we have a long memory because they change people's backgrounds and the characters at whim...no continuity at all. In the first show, Allison was a stylish and trendy dresser because her mother works in the fashion industry, two shows later, she isn't interested in fashion and has 'no fashion sense'.. I would recommend this to the preteen crowd that is only interested in swooning over boys with good hair and brief 'BOO' scares.<br /><br />I gave this a 3 stars because it's not offensive..it's just definitely a kid's show on the par of something Nickelodeon would do as a step up from their &#34;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&#34;.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the cast, love the costumes, love the props, love the scenery, love Highclere Castle! Maggie Smith is priceless as Violet Crawley.  I want to be her when I grow old.
B006LSZECO|5.0|easy read, fast paced, and some big words that she uses, I just click the dictionary and now my vocabulary has improved by a few words :)
6305212112|5.0|This DVD was great i had to adjust a little I am sorry for any inconvience for my first review. The DVD got to very fast and i would recommend this seller to anyone Thank You very much.The movie was Fried Green Tomatos.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i love the game and i love multiplayer, playing other challenging players is awesome. the only down fall is if you are tapping the screen at the same time another player has won or forfeit, you end all play with that person, and will have play another opponent.
B00BHNR1KQ|2.0|For those people that don't care about plot and just want to be scared, this film will work for you!<br />But the fact the \\"boogey man/devil\\" or wtever it was, has to wait till super 8 film is developed in the 1960's to start his dirty work made no sense to me.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This film is right near the top of my personal worst movies of all time list.  It's noting more than a self-conscious remake of Alien (oooh! a humanoid android talking severed head with fluid dripping down its chin--what a clever reference Ridley!) as well as being a prequel.  Full of non sequiturs, inconsistencies, contradictions, plot holes, and cardboard characters. It's not good sci fi.  It's not even a good horror movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book. I'm not a great reader so it takes a good book to keep me interested. This one kept me interested from page one. Do yourself a favor and read the book and forget watching the movie. The movie doesn't do it any justice. I started the book got about 3/4 way thru it then went to see the movie then finished the book. I should have saved the money I spent on the movie to buy the second book.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Compare this to any other angry bird game this is a classic. I love this game and i know there is millions of people that spend hours on the game and i am probably one of them. I would recommend this to any one that loves these kind of games.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|Derek Trucks is truly one of the finest guitarists on the planet, I saw this concert  (not the recorded show, but the time frame) at UB and this CD brought that show to life. A must have for all you &#34;TRUCKHEADS&#34; out there....
B00AESN8XY|5.0|kinda like the comp version but can pick wich countries to infect easy to beat after u play on casual to unlock the genes
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|His portrayal of a functioning alcoholic was very accurate, he truly nailed this part.  I have several very talented, highly skilled, functioning alcoholics in my life, most of them now on-the-mend and long time sober - and his portrayal brought back many old memories of how they truly could not help destroying their own lives as long as they drank.<br /><br />Another great role by a wonderfully talented actor.  Denzel just keeps demonstrating more-and-more his many layers of talent as his career continues.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|I bought this for one song, but the whole thing was just as good. Just my style...really relaxing, just me ear buds, rock music with a rockin chick!
1579129129|5.0|A good friend sent me a signed copy of this over-size, lavish book of exactly what it says it is: photos of animal skulls. I was prepared for the meticulous photographic reproduction but the beauty of the objects is quite stunning and I am in awe of the author’s explications. Details of teeth (Who knew they are all ivory, even mine?), the iconography of skulls (Danger! Poison!), even how the flesh is separated from the bone—all become items of interest as opposed to the usual “ick” response. My favorite: an incredible seahorse skeleton (page 106) that, apropos of my last point, was cleaned using “domestic beetles in laboratory conditions. The beetles start from eggs and only the smaller beetles are able to get inside the … nooks and crannies.” Perhaps you don’t want this on the coffee table at your next dinner party but a couple of hours spent with this book are unbelievably interesting and rewarding.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|At first I was concerned how a 14-year old could 'keep up' with the lead character Will Robie.  But, it worked out fine and didn't hold back the story.  A real page-turner.  I won't go for 5 stars because some of the turns for the characters were predictable - only in the context of a wild D.C. action story like this.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|This product is great and arrived much faster than I thought!  The cards are brand new and the images on them are awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the absolute best app ever and i like it because its awesome and its funny and i think it provented the world from ending
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I chose this movie as a project for school. I was more than pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
B008ACC9CM|5.0|I love these two kids.  Their voices blend so well and are separately beautiful.  Jonathan has a wonderful tenor/baritone voice - rich and full and can be tender.  Charlotte's voice is clear and bell toned.  And the choice of music is good.  They sing modern songs in a classical style - in Italian.  I love it, love it.
B007REV4YI|2.0|I was very disappointed. This just did not feel like a Bond movie at all. It was very predictable and linear. I am a huge fan of 007 and even like this actor, but the movie just flopped. The story was boring and completely ridiculous.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 is a great game I could play for hours however  my stats say that I've earned 55000  coins but in my upgrates it says I only have 900 so be careful with this game.
B004EARTN8|1.0|This is the worst movie ever and there was absolutely no point to it. In addition to the poor story line, there were too many periods of awkward silence.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The book was mesmerizing and I raced to read it so I could share it with friends.  The bravery of the young cancer patients and their witty summation of the treatments really made me appreciate the situation.  John Green took a sad subject and humanized it.  His other works are  on my wishlist now.
1451637500|5.0|The only thing you need to know about this book is that Miles is off again.  This time the 1st page of the book finds him bare foot, in the dark, halucinating because of the drug given him when he was kidnapped.  He's lost in the catacombs that are kept freezing so the bodies there won't thaw.<br />This world believes in freezing to thaw later.  Miles joins forces with a small runaway boy & girl, squatters in an abandoned cryogenic facility.  And things get interesting after that.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|OMG! This CD is amazin, i love it. I can fall in love again and again and again with Mika.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It very fun to play and people enjoy using it playing it cause it very fun funny and I think it the best might be even better than trample run or water is call
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|nothing like mine craft its so stupid I like the new texture packs but bate everything else! its junk but I still like it
B00881VLCE|5.0|I just love this puzzle game it's not to hard they give you alot of different puzzles to do good for young and older people
B0093BUWGE|2.0|Bought this cd after hearing one cut on NPR, which was inventive and enticing.  Regret to say nothing else on this cd measures up.
B0014JGDUC|4.0|I worked about 30 hours a week as a prep cook, took 6 months until the bottom started ripping. Considering the crap these shoes went through, they lasted very well. Helped my back out too, comfy &#60;3
B000RUAR5G|5.0|If you are nostalgic and remember when this movie was made you'll appreciate the laughs. You gotta be a looney tunes fan though... I liked that it's not focused on basketball so much. My kids (6,8,11) loved it very much.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|You have to read it after reading the first one! good book! I can't wait to read the third book.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun ...fun...fun for the young and the old. Keeps you busy for hours if that is what you want to do.
B001FB55I0|3.0|The first two of the Terminator series were the best movies, #3 was a mess and this, very expensively produced, one- finally the last in the series?- was one that left me wanting something, not quite sure what (James Cameron's hand at the wheel maybe). &#34;Rise of the Machines&#34;, #3, left such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't bother ordering this one until I saw it at a bargain bin price, being a 2 disc director's cut with all of the extras the DVD never offered- this one should finally be worth my money.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed reading book one can't wait to purchase book two and find out what happens. Thought the storyline was intriguing and the games interesting. Takes imagination and creativity to write a book like hunger games. Not sure  how I feel about Gale and  Peeta; I feel like peeta was a stranger however didn't get much information on Gale or get to see their interactions except a few times in the first few chapters. I think book two will give more insight on that relationship.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed this so far but it does not give much help in letting you know what to do. When you get to where you locate Robert, you need to buy the game to continue. This should have been told before you download it.
B000VNMMQ6|5.0|Bruce Willis' version of the action hero is always entertaining.  He does what needs doing, throws in a great sense of humor and gets it done!  What more could you ask for?  Yippee Ki-Yay !
1780332009|5.0|Every now and then a book comes along that is right on target and exactly what you need.  This book is one of them.  Countless number of stories makes it well worth the read by grounding the main points in real life situations in education, in sports, in business, and in ordinary life.  It's a whole new lens through which one can make sense of your own and others' actions.
B000001F86|5.0|It came quick in great shape with no problems or issues. I would use them again and I was totally satisfied.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This charger should have been included in the purchase of the HD 8.9 but wasn't.  It seems to work perfectly.  Thanks.
B0013AUZHO|5.0|The first track is introduced with a DJ announcing, \\"Ladies and Gentlemen, the Golden Age of Rock and Roll\\" and the tune kicks in like a freight train with a determination and respect for the genre, but also continues the new plateau that Mott the Hoople established with their previous album \\"Mott\\", thrusting them into a new fearless glam tinged carnival of unique creativity.<br />\\"Marionette\\" is a great study of conformity and teen angst, \\"Alice\\" is a fun rollicking story of a starry eyed whore. If this one-two-three punch of tunes doesn't have you by the onions, you have no pulse.<br />But the album just keeps delivering with the punk foreshadowing \\"Crash Street Kids\\", the ramshackle \\"Born Late '58\\" then the first slower and lovely piece, \\"Trudy's Song\\". \\"Pearl and Roy\\" echoes the conformity of \\"Marrionette\\" but celebrates the joys of rebel youth who stayed behind. \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" - is a heart-wrenching and beautifully orchestrated reflection of a rock star looking at the shallowness of his own life and the inevitability of aging as Ian Hunter sings to the mirror that's been taunting him, \\"I'll never look at you again, because I'm really not that vane\\". Then the album explodes with the brilliant \\"Roll Away the Stone\\", light and poppy by comparison, but the most solid and epic tune on the album with great hooks and a joyful celebration of letting go.<br />This is where the original album ends, but the newer CDs follow with plenty tasty leftovers including the nod to Phil Spector's \\"Wall of Sound\\" sound on \\"Foxy Foxy\\" , the original version of \\"Lounge Lizard\\" (which Hunter took as his own on his first solo album).<br />Mott the Hoople's \\"The Hoople\\" is every bit as solid as the previous \\"Mott\\". These two albums mark a crest of the Mott the Hoople wave as well as a unique moment in the history of rock. This album has managed to still sound fresh and innovative after all these years.<br />A tip of the hat to the engineers on this album who made every songsound shimmering and brilliant.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Sadly, my favorite local political talk station converted to sports at the start of the year. I was so happy that TunedIn enables me to keep getting my \\"fix\\" from the Chicago progressive network. I sprung for the $.99 version because it has a recording function that works very well. Pretty nifty all around!<br /><br />P.S. The TunedIn support staff were responsive and prompt when I sent in a question.
0071762345|5.0|Dave Kerpen not only makes a compelling case for his readers (and their businesses) to be more likeable, but he actually walks the walk in real life.  Follow his twitter and Facebook pages and you'll see what I mean. This is a very busy guy who makes time for people (somehow).  The examples in his book are almost as powerful as the examples in his daily tweets and posts.<br /><br />I read this book on a flight to Arizona and didn't expect to actually finish the entire thing. I mean, as much as the content interests me, it never interested me enough to read a book on it in one day, but what can I say, it's a likeable book.<br /><br />Yes, some of this stuff is familiar to those well-versed in content marketing and social media, but for those of us who are just getting started or know what to do but haven't pushed ourselves to fully implement yet, this book is a nice kick in the keister, reminding us of what we have to lose by not being as transparent and publicly likeable in social media as we actually are in real life.<br /><br />I bookmarked and dog-eared the *#&! out of this book and what I was anticipating keeping in pristine condition to re-sell on Amazon is now creased, highlighted, marked-up, and a permanent part of my personal collection.  A very likeable book from a very likeable guy.
B000002GA8|5.0|It came quick in great shape with no problems or issues. I would use them again and I was totally satisfied.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love it!!!<br />This show manages to capture everything that I can think will be going on if a devastation like this ever happen!! Cant wait 4 season 3!!
B005COO1X6|5.0|VERY EXPLICIT AND GRUESOMLY DETAILED....made me sick to my stomach! Told in first person and very believable! Quick read but worth it!
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|Fine production. Beautiful set at Blenheim Castle. Well done all around. Loved Charlton Heston. Splendid work by Ken Branagh. Thoroughly<br />Enjoyable
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I watched it again on PBS and found some scenes, one I considered important, missing from the DVD. I was surprised at that, and I am glad I made the decision to watch it on PBS as well as on my own DVD. I now have the whole collection, and I am waiting for next year, I am addicted to Downton Abbey, as are millions, so highly recomment you all buying all 3 seasons, Great show! Entertaining and costumes and characters are a must!!!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This app worked as described. Wonderful for the dedicated &#34;Ebayer&#34;. The only drawback is it seems to be a little slow giving you updates on your updates for your transactions.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book! So many lessons! Choose kindness. What a beautiful story. Truly touching!! I love August and his ripple effect on the world!
B008OOYALE|2.0|This sucks...I downloaded and it is not showing on my kindle or android as an app. What a waste of time.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good story line and finally some science fiction instead of Bilbo Baggins fantasy stuff!  The story line is not predictable but wished they would have started with the invasion instead of just dropping you in on the resistance story. If they would have at least given one show of invasion information then I would have given it five stars.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is the best action movie I have seen in years. Run to the store or click furiously but buy this. But it now, buy it twice, buy it for everyone you know!
B0027MJU00|3.0|I enjoyed this book but was a little disappointed by the ending just as I was with Gone Girl. It just sort of ends and leaves you hanging wondering what you missed.
B001D09OAI|4.0|Who doesn't like watching Charlie Sheen as &#34;Wild Thing&#34;...must have been an easy character for him to play. And who could have imagined years later you would be seeing Pedro &#34;Jobu&#34; Cerrano doing car insurance commercials? Good times.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I loved it. I have known many individuals on the spectrum, and find them fascinating. I found this book to be equally fascinating.
B0044XUZ9K|5.0|One most outstanding fictional books ever to be wrote in the late<br />18 hundreds everybody love this book in has a surpise ending
B000QCS8TW|5.0|without a doubt the best  sifi on thew book shelf. youll want to read all of it in one sitting
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I love Fannie flags books  This one was one of the best  Read all of her books , you will not be disappointed.
B00004XQ83|4.0|Really good harmony. it arrived later than the others because it came from china for $.99. If it's a copy, it's a good one. The label is different than the picture, and the plastic box was broken, but I have other boxes.

B00846F1YW|1.0|Waste of time.  Won't acknowledge that you have found &quot;item&quot;.  Inane conversation that slows down an already boring game.  Glad it was free or I'd. really be upset!  Read a book or watch paint dry...anything but play this awful waste of time.  Can't even post this review ...aargh.
1609611543|5.0|liked the book...change the eating habits for some time...avoiding wheat products and eating<br />gluten free ..whole grains...etc...really makes a difference<br />thanks<br />Sue
B0013D8LOK|3.0|The music for this movie has some gems like &#34;Joanna&#34; and &#34;Not While I'm Around&#34;, but the rest is unremarkable. The gore is unnecessary, and a bit over the top; it could have been suggested and left to some thought on the part of the viewer. Explicit gore is apparently desired by the director in order to &#34;sink in&#34; to the mind of the IQ-challenged. I saw a production on television which was much better. While gore was not left to the viewers' imaginations, the situation of meat-pie consumption by the towns-people was not featured at all.<br /><br />Still, the thoughtful viewer will find work-arounds to these deficiencies, and I thought the acting and some musical gems made this video worth watching, though hardly the masterpiece it could have been. Scenery was very dark in most instances, and this seems to be usual for most of Tim Burton's films.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|very nice love it amaizon is a god sent we buy stuff all the time and there pricedf great with everything in stock or we can pre order will continue to buy more and keep up the great prices and keep in stock thanks gene and mary hulsey
B000028U0Y|5.0|My husband love this present, liked that it also came with online download so I was able to put it on other devises too.  Delivery was timely
B009DT424Y|1.0|This unit was shipped fast.  Had a little struggle making it pair with my bluetooth speakers.  It took several tries and I finally had to call Technical support.  The guy was a little hard to understand but was helpful and after doing the same thing I had been doing for about 45 minutes with two different speakers before I called, for some unknown reason, while I was on the phone with him following the manual and his instructions several times, after about 10 minutes and 4 tries, it magically started to work while I was just talking to him, not touching anything. Absolutely no idea why because I had all of my other bluetooth devices off. The other thing to note is that it's output volume is quite low even with the speakers up all the way, the Mic was about 1/2 the volume of the bluetooth music from my phone.  No way that I could find to change that.<br /><br />The big problem is a delay of about 0.5 sec.  What I needed this for was to provide a clip on mic that went to wireless speakers so a presenter could be heard in a large room where the PA system is often not working.  Absolutely useless for this application. There is a delay echo so at that back of the room possibly OK but if you can hear the presenter and the wireless speakers there is this annoying duplication echo.  Also if you were using it as a wireless mic for a Video recorder or something like that, the sound would be out of sync with the presenter's lips.  When I put the mic close to the speakers, and clapped my hands It would echo the clap about 6 times as the volume dissipated.<br /><br />So in summary:  With my speakers up 100%, the mic and speakers were really no louder than my voice alone and the speakers were on an Echo delay so in total it was far worse than nothing at all.<br /><br />I really wanted this to work and in principle it would be a good portable solution for classes etc. But I am returning it.  Beware the Delay!
B007MDQW3C|5.0|Yet so underrated. What else can be said about Regina Spektor? A selfish part of me loves that she is not a household name. When I play her records, I feel as if I'm transported to an intimate piano bar in the Village on a cool autumn evening; listening to her clear, beautiful voice and haunting piano melodies. With Regina though I feel that her music would be no less personal were she a multi-platinum album selling juggernaut.<br />What We Saw from the Cheap seats continues to showcase her immense talent as a pianist, songwriter and vocalist. The album displays her trademark quirkiness, yet can also be haunting and extremely evocative. From the cute &#34;Don't Leave me&#34; to the blues-y &#34;How&#34; and the chilling &#34;Open&#34;, we see that Regina has a wealth of musical competence and knows how to employ it to create powerful piano ballads and catchy tunes alike.

B00AQMSJI2|5.0|My son LOVES this game. It is very simple in nature and great for those moments when they need to be detracted for a few moments but can quit at any time, I use this at the Dr all the time.

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Yes, you only get &asymp;15 minutes to play,  but you can play it as many times as you want without re-installing. And if you want to buy minecraft, get this insted. Its much cheaper and you get the same basic thing.
B000062V9C|1.0|The movie wouldn't play.  It have an error that said it couldn't in this region.  I don't even know what that mans.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I am 37 and I love the new MLP. This is a game that fallows the concept of the new tv series. The only thing bad that I could say is that I have no friends to play with me and if you want to be serious in the game you are going to have to spend money on gems.After playing to level 35 game lost all info and I had to re install and start over....LAMEEEEEEEEEEEE
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am late to coming to the Walking Dead, I didn't think I would enjoy a gory show about zombies, but this series is amazing. The characters are what draws you in. It constantly surprises you and keeps you coming back to see how the survivors will make out. I watched all the episodes back to back, so I am glad I just discovered this series.
1603420398|5.0|Another wonderful book from master Edie Eckman.  Crochet motifs in all their squishy goodness.  A must for every crocheters library.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I was having so much fun that's when the game ended I was like &quot;that's it?!&quot; I so wanted more.  Some puzzles were a little to easy but I really had a good time. On the lookout for more.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|I look for east quick games and this is a long playing time one. Others may find it fun but not for me.
B007HACDLK|4.0|From the very beginning, i was brought into the story and with every page turn i was focused and entrenched in the action.
1603425381|5.0|Edie is a master pattern writer and this book is no exception.  Wonderful, colorful edges of all kinds to suit all crochet levels from beginner and beyond.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just downloaded this game and this is the first time I got off. The thing I really like is u don't have to buy the characters u earn the buy find their signiture item on the go!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Thanks for promptly sending the DVD and for discounting the price!  We greatly enjoyed watching it before the broadcasts were completed on PBS!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I find it very satisfying using this product and i appreciate the option of accessing music from any device. Only wish i could put all of my music media on here.
B003I55BIA|4.0|Omg this book was sooooo good! I'm glad that I stayed up half of the night just to finishes it. But I gave it a 4 star because it could probably be a little shorter but I still loved the book. I advise this book to anyone who liks some good sappy romance! ;D
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I had to read this book for a class. I was not expecting to like it, but it turns out it is really good. Much of what he says is very interesting, and I personally also believe it to be true. Regardless, I think it is well worth the read and will be interesting for anyone with an interest in people.
B000HZED8S|5.0|It was a great action movie. Great story, lots of fantasy and ideas regarding characters, landscapes, equipments, actions. The acting was simple and adequate.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|A very handy way of reading. I like that i have access to books and not actually having to carry a book!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|what an exciting read, very gratifying to experience the healing power of love in this most unusual genera...thank you ms james ...keep them coming
B004MC0FO8|4.0|Awesome application helps you identify music you like so you can purchase it and helps you not drive yourself crazy trying to remeber the name or artisit of a song u like.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Works great on Kindle Fire ..very addicting!  Half the family is playing it ..adding to Kindle Fire was a great idea.  So far, no problems.
B0026WNGBA|4.0|It's time to put what I learned into practice. I am hoping to run my fourth marathon in the fall injury free.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|the trilogy was at times difficult in content and concept and at the same time enlightening and empowering ..... when the last period was upon the last sentence i felt good...wish there were more e.l.james and i am sure there will be and i so look forward to her next endeavor.
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|Excellent Film! Very Very Scary! Perfect Editing. Quality Acting..Outstanding Soundtrack...So Worth the Money...Keep the Lights On After...You&#34;ll Need To...It's That Haunting, That Shocking...That Solidly a Modern Horror Classic.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Bought for my children, they claim it's great, wife does too.<br />Me? I might try.<br />The price was very reasonable.<br /><br />Definitely a recommend.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The the writing in this book flows nicely. The transitions are well done in my opinion and well set up so that when situations come up the reader may make conclusions without an abundance of quandary.<br /><br />Unfortunately I saw the movie first and therefore am not able to really judge some of the descriptiveness because I had a visual point of reference from the movie.<br /><br />This is not the kind of book I would normally read but it held my attention and I felt  well connected to the primary character. I would be happy to read more of this writer's books
B00AY9RV90|5.0|Few and far between are the bands from the 1980's that can maintain the sound they made famous and still sound relative to today's music scene.  Electronic pioneers Depeche Mode are one of great example - New Order is another.  I was hesitant on this because it's their first album without founding Joy Division / New Order bass player Peter Hook.  Having one of the most distinctive sounds in bass playing seems like it might be a crippling loss, but they charge on what appears to be effortlessly.  My only complaint on this album is that at eight tracks and under forty minutes I expected a bit more in quantity, but quality is far from lacking.  Well worth checking out!
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I don't often feel compelled to write reviews, but I do here. I was so excited to read this series after such overwhelmingly glowing reviews. I read A LOT of books and I know what constitutes a good read. This was just plain boring. I was bored, the writing was amateur, the plot line had so much potential but fell flat so I am left so confused. Anyone else feel like these reviews are some sort of conspiracy? Want a good read? Check out The Passage by Justin Cronin. Sorry, I just don't get the hype on this one.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is absolutely addictive.  I play it with my son in another state, my daughter who lives next door, my grandchildren and total strangers.  It is challenging, funny, forces you to think ahead and just a great way to unwind.  I cannot wait for my evenings to get here so I can play while my husband watches tv. I recommend this to anyone who can see!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|For modern tastes the book is probably long-winded for most; however, when I was younger I had the patience to get through it. The moral points and descriptions are so artistically written in various places throughout the book that I am unable to give it less-than-perfect as a rating. However, in modern times it is the discipline of patience to get through it and could be considered a training exercise to ward off instant gratification tendencies.<br /><br />One of the beauties that Victor Hugo is highly skilled at is his presentation of moral dilemma where it truly counts in human relationships. Value systems in modern times are more challenged than ever – – it would be interesting to see how he would write in the modern world today to state his case is and make his points.<br /><br />I would recommend this book because it requires so much patience that one can understand more about how things were for human beings over the previous centuries and how our struggles in some ways have  become more difficult because of modern media and the fact answers are instantly on hand and no longer seem to require the discipline of learning that they previously have in human history.<br /><br />Respect and order and the need for it has not changed; but, during this book's time--the elites had a stranglehold on both-- and the poor had little or no voice and all and would often fall easily into vice for the mere sake of survival, which influences the need for mercy on others who may not meet with usual social approval. Behaviors may change in human beings out of necessity – – but their character and how they treat other human beings may be consistent whether they are in any economic state. It reinforces that people should not be judged by their mere need to survive in the struggles surrounding that but how they respond to other human beings-- this is where his excellent in writing comes through and why I rated fully in the recommendation.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|Good theme, and drama.  It's a very well polished film, but to suggest someone &#34;high and drunk&#34; can coordinate the required actions to land a plane, like no other pilot can, is simply going against logic and scientific tests.
B005LAII1C|5.0|You get all the content you couldn't let your kid hear @ the cinema. Both editions are there plus lot of extra bonus stuff you will enjoy. Fantastic !!!
B002TKFEZK|5.0|This book is valuable in that it provides huge amounts of quality data related to economic collapses, banking crises and provides a significant amount of historical data on how long financial crises impacted both the developed and developing countries of the world. This is an informative read and one that is worthy of having in ones personal library. I bought both kindle version first and read it and then was given a gift of it by a friend which I often refer to because of the ease of reading the tables.<br /><br />The authors are highly qualified and well known and one finds this book referenced in dozens of other books on the subject of economics.

1451627297|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I loved how Mr. King was so descriptive. I felt like I was actually back in 1958-1963 with George Amberson. I connected with all of the characters in the book, and I really enjoy when that happens. I feel as though they are my personal friends or acquaintences. I was very impressed with how factual information was entwined with the story. At first I thought it was going to have more of a documentary feel about it. I was glad it was more about the characters and the assasination was worked around the story. I didn't want the story end.......
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I'm a fan of romantic comedies.  This is neither.  This movie isn't just an insult to the American people, it's the reason that I drink.

B000ICXQS8|4.0|Brokeback Mountain has become a punchline in our culture, and I think that's a shame because it's really a pretty good movie.  Near as I can tell, there are three camps of people who don't like it: those who will never accept a movie about homosexuality, those who think it's just too slow and long, and those who think its plot and characterization actually do a disservice to LGBT individuals.  I have a few things to say to that last group:<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain is a tragic story about lovers who can't be together... so they're (ambiguously) gay this time, it's not really different than having them be from different races or social classes as is typical.  Point is, most viewers knew this story wasn't going to turn out well just because of the genre.  It's not punishing the main characters for having a homosexual relationship.  I know it's about time we had some movies in which the gay characters got a happy ending--however, those movies will doubtless not be set in the American south in the 1960s.<br /><br />Another common complaint I see is that Ennis especially was not a sympathetic character, and that most viewers felt sorry for both men's neglected wives.  My response to that is, don't you think you were supposed to?  The women didn't do anything wrong.  They got a raw deal too.  But this is a movie about unhappy people, and furthermore, *imperfect* people.  For crying out loud, do people expect every movie protagonist to be somebody they could be best friends with?  I don't like Ennis, really; he's aggressive and cold to both Alma and Jack.  That doesn't mean the story doesn't work, and that doesn't mean all gay(ish) people are implied to be unlikeable.<br /><br />Lastly, lots of people feel the homosexual scenes look awkward and observe the heterosexual relationships get more screentime.  They've got a point about that second part, but I think the apparent difficulty that the actors have seeming intimate suits their characterization, even if it wasn't intentional.  Jack is more comfortable with his orientation or whatever than Ennis, but neither of them really understands their own feelings or wants to be different from the norm.  So if you're looking for a movie about the triumph of gay true love...  maybe consider watching Maurice?  The novel it's based on was considered subversive in its day for having a gay relationship turn out well.  As I see it, though, Brokeback Mountain is about characters, not issues.  It's not out to change the world; if you ask it to, you're going to be disappointed.

B001EC2ISA|4.0|Beetlejuice is quirky, thoroughly novel, and has Tim Burton's name written all over it.  That said, tonally and in terms of the production value it's kinda childish, and I'm not sure it makes what you'd call a hell of a lot of sense.  I know it's rated PG, but today I'm sure it'd be PG-13, so think twice about letting little kids see it--at least screen it first.  If you're going to watch it as a teen or an adult, I'd suggest marathoning it with some other Halloweeny films if you're having a movie night.  It's enjoyable enough but cannot be taken seriously at all.<br /><br />I should mention, there's some joking about suicide--I could understand if that might be sensitive to some.  The sexual humor isn't entirely tasteful either, or actually tasteful at all.  It's not meant to be acceptable, however.  The movie is basically playing its own offensiveness for laughs, I think.<br /><br />Some stray observations:<br />Ya gotta love the dinner party scene.  I won't spoil why, but it's the funniest part of the movie.<br />Alec Baldwin was pretty cute when he was younger.  How about that.<br />Does Betelgeuse remind anyone of the Joker at all, in one incarnation or another?<br />Starting around the séance scene, the movie actually built up some decent tension.  I wouldn't have expected that.

1481130331|4.0|The Weissensteiners is an intellectual achievement and a lesson in historical perspective, as we are reminded that history is just that, a story told from a human point of view.  In any given period of time, there are as many stories as there are participants, along with many converging sensibilities.<br /><br />The setting is Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, 1933.  We follow along with the Weissensteiner family on an epic journey, from the pre-WWII years to the end of the war, with an epilogue culminating during the fall of the Berlin wall.  They are not an insular family, and have a great many friends and acquaintances that move in and out of the story line.<br /><br />Greta and her family are Jewish, but this is decidedly not another rendition of the holocaust.  The novel illustrates how the destruction of war rained down on both Jews and non-Jews, who were part of the same community, often got along quite well and even intermarried.  We learn that, at least in Bratislava, many non-Jews detested the Nazi's, and quietly tried to hide a Jewish friend or two, if they could manage without being discovered.  Through no fault of their own they too suffered terrible hardships, hunger and loss of property, sickness and death.<br /><br />I think we readers are accustomed to accounts of WWII that portray the Jews as victims, and the non-Jews as either perpetrators or uninterested people out to save their own skins, but in the Weissensteiners there is no sharp line of demarcation.  Instead, we see how ordinary people were swept up in the same storm of war and tossed about by fate.  Through a bit of luck, some narrowly escape destruction, only to perish later on through one mistaken move, or an arbitrary unlucky event.<br /><br />The families and extended families we meet are quite large, so the novel is chock full of people.  We learn many details about their lives, their thoughts and feelings, their relationships, all through the voice of an omniscient narrator.  There are paragraphs of historical accounts that for me, read like a history book; sometimes the narration continues along this vein when describing the intimate details of people's lives.  These long periods of narration often felt rather distant, sounding like a reporter summing up the facts.<br /><br />However, throughout some chapters there was lively dialogue that made you feel as if you were traveling along with real people, evoking the emotional connection that I especially enjoy in any novel.  During these times I felt anger and fear, anxiety and relief.  I also came away feeling that I learned something of the history and people of the region.  All in all, I strongly recommend that you read The Luck of the Weissensteiners.
B008Y7G6UO|5.0|Jeff Bridges is totally convincing as an alien inhabiting another persons body. His analytical demeanor that eventually shows joy is the main point of the story.

B0052RDHTM|3.0|This is not a book I'd choose to read again, and I likely won't choose anything by Ken Follett in the future.  It's a book best read by someone who doesn't mind the &#34;F&#34; word and very coarse language on every other page.  What I did like about it was the war story told showing all the different sides.  Usually a story is told favoring one side of an issue, where I'm cheering for one party or side.  That wasn't the case with this book.  I thought it made it interesting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It grabbed my attention from the start. I recommend to all ages of readers. Have already started the next one.

B005COO1X6|3.0|Good story ,ending was strange  .classic Steve King, shortest story I think I've read that he has written , some of his work though if it is so long loses my interest, this one at lest kept me interested.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Its a really fun game. I wasn't sure about the price, but after buying it I think it was worth it. There are four people you can choose to do hairstyles on. (Ones a monkey), but the rest are people. They have all types of ways to do the hair. Straightener, curler, and some thing that I guess makes the hair wavy. I don't know. You can dye the hair also, and wash and dry it, with a blow dryer or a towel. There are also accessories. When you do certain things to the people's hair they make cute faces and noises. The monkey is the cutest to me. It is an amazing game.

B007HACDLK|3.0|Glad to have Mr. Flynn around.  He knows who the bad guys are and treats them deservedly.  As with many of his contemporaries, his heroes are a little to heroic and the villians a little too villianous.
