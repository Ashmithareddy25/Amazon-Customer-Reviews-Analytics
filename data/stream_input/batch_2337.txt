B0084B5TK8|5.0|Movie after movie declare to accurately follow this book faintly, but basically the only faithful following is in the title , as each honors the movie writers additions and embellishments they unsightly call the rights of the writers. They give no justice, nor believability as the book does. People who depend on movies to give their opinions of a book are greatly deceived and should spend their time better in reading the book the movie is based on, reading is a window to the soul and inspiration of an individual!

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Love this game!  It's fast and fun and easy to play.  I use it as bubble gum for the brain and to keep my hands and mind busy.  But it is addictive.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I don't know if it's just me but I loved it a little unrealistic but a fantasy anyone would want and to get rapped up in I wish I had a Connor

B000069HKH|3.0|Early Springsteen albums sounded much better before all the signal processing.  I hope the recorded  tracks are unmolested and sometime we can hear Bruce's later music in a much better light.  I love Further on Down the Road but it sounds like mush.  If anyone can point me to a better sounding live version.....<br /><br />Five stars for the music, averaged to one star for the audio.
B000GTR2DS|5.0|Yet the writing is so full that we can feel part of this other world.<br /><br />I came to this story by the back door. My first introduction to Somerset Maugham was through the movie \\"The Razor's Edge\\" (1946) staring Tyrone Power as Larry Darrell. I have no idea as to how much it was adapted from the book. Then in 1984 we watched Bill Murray as Larry Darrell. This film lost what magic the 1946 film had. So it was time to read the book. Yes I know very few films can do more than present the essence of a book. Turns out that even the older film wrote Summerset out of some of the scenes.<br /><br />Larry is back from the war (WWI). As with many of us he is left with nagging questions about why one person lives and another must die. This problem leads Larry to search for the answers. He turns down opportunities and takes up a lifestyle to help him find answers.  This story is told or narrated by Somerset Maugham himself. In the book Somerset takes more of an active part in the story. Larry came as close as any of us to the answer, he seeks and we leave him much the same way one enters and leaves your life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0007PALVQ The Razor's Edge]]<br />[[ASIN:6303333079 Razor's Edge [VHS]]]

B001UGB1X8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely in all respects, however, I have enjoyed all of James Lee Burke's books for many years. I think Tommy Lee Jones was pretty much what I always expected the Robicheaux character to be.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Thought provoking and compelling, at turns deep and profound. Would recommend to any reader of science fiction, especially before the movie comes out.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Good strategy is the key .  Enjoying the power of not knowing when the game will end.  I think children of all ages should play this game.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Characters with real problems on top of dealing with zombies.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Slightly different from the TV series, but in a good way.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a beautiful story of coming to peace with the pain we habor from the past, and the mistakes of politeness and decorum we make especially in interacting with the people we need the most. By providing such characters against whom we can judge ourselves it provides us with tools for self reflection
B003M2DWE4|5.0|I bought this because i love the design and i needed a new alarm clock, and so far so good, it looks really amazing, and it´s not so loud and annoying
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is really well written, simple direct language with touching metaphors. The story is a masterpiece for its simplicity, imaginative dystopia.<br />Why they didn't put in silo elevators might make sense after all...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, I can play it for what seems like hours because it so fast paced, especially since they have started adding new themes!  Keep up the great work!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Like the other two great Gillian Flynn novels, this book is very disturbing but it keeps the reader interested. This thriller keeps you on edge and once you think you now who did it throws you a curve ball.<br />It's a great thriller novel it's a must read! :)
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really approve of this book. Normally I don't like reading books set in the present and in high school because I like to use books to get away from reality, but this book was sensational. This book is one of those rare books or poems or movies or pieces of art that leave you feeling raw at the end. That change your perspective and give you hope. This book is like a deep sigh or standing in warm rain. It's refreshing and you become very attracted to its characters. The book trickles into your own life and you start thinking.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|Seems much like a sequel for knocked up with out some of the characters, with a very bold and interesting<br />take on marriage at age 40 as well as all the little surprises behind that it brings. This movie, I watched twice due to some of the scenes with Paul Rudd. Absolutely hilarious. The dynamic between all characters are driven with laughter. A much watch if you enjoyed any of  Judd Apatow's movies in the past.
B005HSL626|4.0|Love this app its awsome lots of fun for everyone any age really enjoy playing this game hours of enjoyment

B002RVZV9U|5.0|C'mon, legendary Rock guitarists of future and past? How could you not get absorbed into this DVD. Its great just watching them share stories behind their music, influences, sharing licks... I especially love Jack White teaching them Seven Nationa Army.
B004EI2NM2|4.0|Enjoyed this movie. Even though it is mostly shot in one room, it gives you the feeling that you are in Europe.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|I've shown this to my kids. They like it too. I bought this after seeing Peter Gabriel for the upteenth time in 2012. It's a must own for any Peter Gabriel fan.
B008458O3S|4.0|I love this game. Challenging but not so hard that u can't solve the puzzles (though I did need help on the last level).  it is slow but in a good way - a thinking game. lots of puzzzles plus bonus games - def worth the price. can't wait for updates or more levels. will def pay for other versions and other games from this dev.
B005DESVPO|4.0|Inventive guitar playing with strong vocals. Wish it were a LP instead of an EP. I listened to this EP one time through then ordered every CD available by Gary Clark JR.
B0050SRZOQ|5.0|If you are looking for a hero then look no further!  This was the best finale to a series I've ever seen!  They took both the known legend of Superman and the television teenager they created and made him grow up to be a man before our eyes.  There is romance, genuinely touching moments (don't mock me because I cried), and a fitting end/beginning to each character's story.  Watch this series from beginning to end and enjoy!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Yep , and for good reason. Folky, Celtic, Roots, and great songwriting. High energy ! Can't wait to hear this band live.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|As another review mentioned, one of the classic lyrics in this great, new album is \\"...Tuesdays, we get Jello if we're good.\\"  Well, the fellas in Spock's Beard all deserve a nice bowl of their favorite flavor of Jello, with or without various, odd things floating inside.  (Eww...)<br /><br />I'm one of those who pre-ordered this CD off the SB site and received it extra early.  I totally spaced the concept that I could review it here, so here I am now.  First Thing I'll say: GREAT \\"comeback\\" album!<br /><br />I say \\"comeback\\", in a sense that SB took another crushing blow in the loss of original drummer and replacement singer, Nick D'Virgilio.  (Left of personal reasons.)  Replacing him on drums is Jimmy Keagan, the bands tour drummer who's been with them for several years and knows the bands sound well.  The \\"newbie\\" is the singer, Ted Leonard.  It's always scary to bring in new singers to bands, but Ted ROCKS!  Just keep in mind that he's not Neal.  He's not Nick.  He's TED.  His voice is unique in it's own way, but I can also tell it will be quite adaptable to both Neal and Nick era material, a definite plus!<br /><br />Another plus is the songwriting.  Ted is a great songwriter.  (There are the other usual songwriters as well though.)  Also, making a guest appearance in the songwriting is Mr. Neal Morse himself.  Helps bring back that \\"old school\\" sound.  On that note, I might even go so far to say that this is my favorite SB album SINCE Neal left the band.  I like the Nick stuff, but I'm really digging this album.<br /><br />In all honesty, I wanted to give this album a 4 or a 4.5 if possible.  I figured I'd round up considering the circumstances.<br /><br />Favorite songs:  Submerged, Afterthoughts, Wish I Were Here (WIWH is from the 2nd disc.  Has some humorous lyrics in it.)  :)<br /><br />Sorry, I'm not good at writing reviews.  Just know that I'm a SB fan and I'm strongly recommending this album to anyone who's considering it.<br /><br />UPDATE: 6/24/13  I'm STILL loving this album!  Even though I kind of hate it when people try to compare new singers to others, (we're not looking to clone people here) I'd say that Ted's more of a Nick than a Neal.  On that note, I think that in a live setting, as I mentioned earlier, Ted's got a voice that's going to blend very well between both Neal and Nick era stuff while also being original to his own.  Complicated, I know, but true.  I had never heard of Ted Leonard or Enchant before this all went down, but now I've become quite interested.  Blessing and a curse...<br /><br />If you still don't have this album, I can't understand what it is you're waiting for?  The Beard is out there, GO GET IT!'m STILL loving this album!

B004SBS8LA|5.0|All my other angry bird apps started with a small amount of adds. after every update to the app more and more add appear, until you cant even get through one round with out several apps interrupting the game.what more can I say about Amazon Angry Birds app?  It is add free totally awesome.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Its like Bioshock on my tablet! Awesome! Cool puzzles, creepy atmosphere, cool sounds and decent graphics! I Definitely recommend trying this one.
B00B23O96A|1.0|Just a wasted album.  Not any gems even.  When Eric goes back to the '70s reggae stuff that packs this collection, well. . .put on your PJs and go to bed.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Came on time and gets better the more you listen to it.  Best CD ever.  I have nothing else to say.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|My daughter did not like. She found the story boring and the characters a bit creepy. She did not finish watching it.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|If you love celtic music in general and Celtic Woman in particular, you will definitely want this in your music library.  I can listen to it by the hour.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun and user friendly. I seem to have issues connecting to Facebook through the app, but otherwise, no problems so far.
145162607X|5.0|It arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  Since I am a big fan of historical novels, I could hardly wait for it to arrive and was very pleased with it when it came.  I love her English history series.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of my all time favorite books. Perfectly captures the awkward, passion, and brilliance of being young. I will always hold a special place in my heart for this book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It arrived quickly and in great condition.  We immediately had a Downton Abbey marathon.  The architecture, the clothes, the characters.  What a great soap with a strong cast and good historical basis.  One of the best.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|You can't lose in this game.  Literally!  There is no time limit or annoying warnings that you are running out of time (at least I haven't run into that).  You can play at your own pace without anxiety or you can challenge yourself to beat your best time. It's your choice!  I am on the lookout for other Cubistry games. One that rotates on its own would be fun!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series. Just wish the new season would be released sooner than 2014<br />It is very interesting and entertaining.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|I would really enjoy this game if the tiles were just a bit larger.  The tiles in another one of their fabulous games &#34;Around the World in 80 Days&#34; are extra large.  I realize this game has a larger tile set so the tiles need to be smaller, but the entire game background is reduced - there plenty of space to enlarge!! I will check again later and &#34;buy&#34; when I can see the game :-)
B00006IU73|5.0|This is flat out one of the best Prog-Rock CDs I have ever heard. Ihad to rush ou8t and buy their other CD, Deadwing, Fear of a Black Planet and The Incident. They're awesome, too. Buy this CD. Now!
0718178122|2.0|Don Tillman is an Associate Professor of Genetics with (probably) Asperger's Syndrome who has decided that, as he is nearing 40, he will solve &#34;the wife problem&#34; (ie. not being married) by creating a questionnaire that will ascertain, for him, the perfect wife and then marry her. That is until he meets Rosie, a grad student working part-time in a gay bar who's looking for her biological father, and slowly Don's &#34;Wife Project&#34; becomes &#34;The Rosie Project&#34; as he realises he's falling in love with her.<br /><br />I say that Don probably has Aspergers because it's never explicitly stated but as he narrates the book in the first person, the reader is immediately aware that he sees the world differently than the rest of us. It's kind of like having Sheldon Cooper from &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; talking to you - Don is a genius with no social skills who's unable to read facial expressions and has a highly regimented lifestyle and peculiar way of speaking.<br /><br />Couple that with the opening scene where he gives a talk on Aspergers and it's highly suggested that he has it. Not knowing anyone with Aspergers, I can't tell whether he sounds convincingly like someone with it but what little I know of the condition suggests that his personality is unlikely to change as dramatically as Don's does throughout the book. It's almost like his meeting Rosie reverses the condition. I mean, he's unable to feel love - but he can? He's unable to read facial expressions or understand social conventions - but then he can?<br /><br />Nevertheless I thought the first 200 pages of the book were charming. Don is a likeable guy whose eccentric lifestyle makes a change of pace to the usual rom-com formula and the different angle it gives to the genre made me interested in it even though romantic comedies aren't usually my thing. There were also some excellent scenes that stuck out memorably like Don and Rosie's first date, from using aikido on the waiters to altering time and having dinner on a whiteboard (not as surreal as it sounds but nice touches anyway), and Don and Rosie's moonlighting as cocktail waiters and Don using his remarkable memory (eidetic?) to take complex drink orders for dozens of people at a time. I read the first two-thirds of the book in a couple days, smiling a lot throughout. And then I got to the final third which took me over a week and ruined the book for me.<br /><br />The first 200 pages had been unique to the rom-com genre and felt highly original which is why I responded so well to it - it wasn't going over the same ground countless other stories had gone over before. The final third is all about convention and it opens with a scene in New York. The story is set in Australia but because Don and Rosie are hell bent on finding Rosie's biological father, their search takes them to two possible fathers in NY. This 50 page section felt completely contrived and could've been cut from the book entirely.<br /><br />This book was originally a screenplay and these scenes felt very cinematic and included so that film backers would have recognisable locations for their film to make it easier to sell, rather than serving the story. Yes, the finding Rosie's real dad storyline is in play but if you took those two people away from NY and cut it entirely, the book would've been snappier. As such it feels really contrived and dull, like the scene in the movie where the two romantic leads get to do a kind of montage sequence of things. It also constantly references other romantic comedy movies the entire time too, adding to the feeling that this is a homage to the genre and included because that's what's expected when you do something like this.<br /><br />Then the final 70 or so pages are about Don winning Rosie back and it's done in such a conventionally rom-com way that I totally lost interest. Worse, Don's character didn't seem consistent in this part either (see the criticisms in the Aspergers section above).<br/><br />I've used the label &#34;romantic-comedy&#34; throughout because that's what the marketing says it is but it's not. It's romantic, sure, but it's not funny. I didn't laugh once and didn't think Don's numerous social faux pas to be particularly funny either. Worse still are the scenes which are clumsily designed to be funny and feel very forced, like when Don is learning sexual positions from a book and uses a skeleton (he's at the university for this scene so it's not a Dahmer moment or anything) and the Dean walks in on him. It feels like the kind of scene in a sitcom where the canned laughter goes on and on as the camera switches from Don's face to the Dean's and back again while the audience begins to clap and laugh at the same time. It might as well be labelled &#34;funny scene&#34;. And it's not.<br /><br />Despite my criticisms, I was quite happy to give this book 3 stars - until I read the end. Now I know the ending shouldn't have more importance over any other aspect of the story, whatever the genre, but the ending to this book is especially bad. So Rosie at the very start when she's introduced to Don, tells him about her dad Phil, a man who raised her alone after her mum died when Rosie was 12, who's a person whom she doesn't particularly get along with (largely because of a minor quibble which she's unreasonably held against him for her entire life) - but no more so than any other person who doesn't get along with their mum or dad for whatever reason. Except she's convinced herself he can't possibly be her real dad and that her real dad must be out there somewhere. This is basically the motivation for everything Don and Rosie do in this entire book and right off, I thought &#34;I bet it turns out Phil IS her real dad after all&#34;. Well... I won't give it away but you can kind of guess what happens in the end. And I really, really hated that. Don all but says what I was feeling in the second-to-final sentence of the book and I immediately dropped the book down another star.<br /><br />This book definitely has some good moments and Don is a memorable and oftentimes delightful character, but the final third of the book really frustrated me. If the book had been more tightly edited with the NY sequence thrown out and had had a less predictable ending, I would be enthusiastically recommending this novel. As it is, it is a flawed debut novel that's well written but severely lacking in crucial parts of the story reducing it from a charmingly quirky romance story to yet another rom-com with no surprises and a sloppily rushed final act. Graeme Simsion can write and he might one day write a brilliant novel but sadly &#34;The Rosie Project&#34; is not that book./><br />I've used the label &#34;romantic-comedy&#34; throughout because that's what the marketing says it is but it's not.

B002K0WBXW|5.0|The chemistry between a book editor and her assistant is simply tangy in this amusing story about a shady arrangement that goes awry.  I found the scenery to be enchanting and immediately wanted to take a cruise to Alaska!  A really good time...even my action-movie-loving husband liked it!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|This WAS a great app but so get so far and then it resets the gold bars and special features.  I will be deleting it. Waste of time.
B000LXHK2C|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies.  I watch it at least once every month because the story is so pleasing.  The magnificent scenery in the French countryside never fails to delight me.  The music is beautiful and the relationship between an old man and his young nephew is so very heartwarming.  I love it more every time I see it.

0441013597|3.0|I really enjoyed the way Frank Herbert transported me into a different time and place so completely. The way he built the world of Arrakis in my imagination was so detailed. Once the setting was established I ate up every fantastic scene until the story became more of a war tale than a science fiction novel. The length of the novel slowed how quickly I turned the pages and I just lost interest in the epic battle by the end.
B0091REZMW|4.0|One of the better hidden object games I've played. Yes you do have to wait for energy and strength to regenerate, so just consider it an exercise in patience. You can't just sit down and play the game for hours, but the different modes and different rooms keep the game from being monotonous.
0345525558|3.0|I really enjoyed this short drama. It was easy to read and kept me interested. I thought the characters were well developed, but seemed unrealistic. Victoria was the only character I thought really jumped off the page. I found myself wrapped up in her story and hoping for a happy ending. I didn't feel the weight of Victoria's trials the way I should have though. Something was missing. I think the lack of character depth made it impossible for me to be invested in any of Victoria's relationships and that took away some of the emotional impact the book had on me.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great Game. My daughter is having lots of fun with this game, but its too hard to earn gems. You can buy gems, but they're really expensive!
0062080237|4.0|I really enjoyed this story. Some of the scenes were so fantastic that I felt like dropping my book and writing fan mail to Neil Gaiman right that second. His imagination is seriously out of this world! There were so many characters and each one of them was so unique and interesting. It was a bit overwhelming! I can't say I was ever bored while reading this lengthy novel, but it was easy to put down and at times hard to pick back up again. I think the book contained a little too many side stories and for me, that took away my drive to follow the plot. I was never hooked, but I read on greedily anyway to see what other kind of fantastic creature or situation Gaiman could introduce me to. I give it 3.5 stars.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Great book. Dr. Davis knows what he's talking about. I tend to disagree with the advice re: recommending Dairy so strongly. Dairy creates health issues as well. I am not at the point where I'm willing to &#34;buy&#34; the no oats argument either. Maybe someday.

B00BN0BZVY|5.0|As the parent of an adult bipolar man, this helped me to understand just a little better what the internal dialogue must be like for him - the struggles to make sense of things, the struggle to maintain appearances while thoughts are racing.  I laughed, I cried - this is an endearing and insightful book.  I read the book after seeing the movie - and while I liked the movie, I wish it had stayed truer to the book.  It could have been even more powerful.  If you have family members who are a little \\"odd,\\" this is a good read for you.
0375507256|5.0|I'm not going to do a book review here but just say, it is a strange book, about 4 stories that seems to roll up to one conclusion, I'm not done yet.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I bought this book this Trilogy (The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay) in May of 2012 and I love all of them! I read all 3 books when I purchased them, and I have gone back and read all of them slowly. They were very good books both times, and I really wish the author would continue with the Hunger Games saga.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it cuz u don't have to tilt it and ot is awesome!!!!! U the only thing i dont like is when one time I went on the game it toatlly just deleted everything!

B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I just got this app(the free version), and I think it works well for what it is. I wish there was a way to cut and paste something from one notebook to another but there isn't. Also the colors and fonts of the notebooks are limited in the free version and that kind of disappointed me but I refuse to pay money for most apps. The free version is perfect for note taking, planning, organizing and list making which is what I'm using it for. I love that I can email the notebooks to my main computer to have as a backup.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love subway surfers but one day it just would not let  me do anything and l was at 10,646 coins Jake the guy was moving but the 'buttons just would not work and I don't want to delete all my coins HELP!!!!!!!!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game to get lost in. It's like my other world. Lol. I recommend this app to anyone whom likes hunting games. Y do they have to put a minimum word count in order to post it. Gur
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|what a horrible waste of time and talent; and all of the f..k you's in the script don't make up for what is totally vapid film.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|Anthony Hopkins did a superb job portraying Hitch. Any role Hopkins portrays is always a must-see!  The &#34;history&#34; of Hitchcock was very well written and helps make a memory of one of our great movie moguls.
B00B69UQEO|3.0|I suppose I came late to Depeche Mode. They weren't really successful in the U.S. until 1990's \\"Violator\\", which is about when I started taking notice of them. Oh sure, I knew \\"Never Let Me Down Again\\" and \\"People Are People\\" and maybe \\"I Just Can't Get Enough\\", but beyond those, not much else. In retrospect, I don't understand why Depeche Mode weren't as popular as Human League, Soft Cell, Men Without Hats, Howard Jones, Thompson Twins, Wang Chung, etc. Maybe they didn't cater to top 40 radio as much, maybe they didn't have some image that was marketable, I'm not sure. The music speaks for itself in terms of hooks and advances with technologies. They should have been much bigger in the U.S. back in the 1980's.<br /><br />But I digress.....it was \\"Violator\\" that got me on board, and now I own all of their albums, and now I am a converted fan. However, as a critical fan, rather than an adoring fan, I have had trouble rating and ranking their most recent albums because, for me, \\"Delta Machine\\", \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\", \\"Playing The Angel\\", \\"Exciter\\" and \\"Ultra\\" have all pretty much sounded the same. Now, you and I could debate for hours the finer points of each album, but at the end of the debate we would agree that none of these albums are as high quality as what the band produced before them. They're all well produced, textured, fine and dandy efforts, but none of them rank four or five stars.<br /><br />In fact, \\"Delta Machine\\" sort of lacks any hit single (not that there has to be one). Even \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" had \\"Wrong\\" on it. All the songs on \\"Delta Machine\\" are good, but none really stood out to me. I suppose \\"My Little Universe\\", \\"Soft Touch/Raw Nerve\\" or \\"Soothe My Soul\\" could be 'hits'. Or maybe \\"Welcome To My World\\", \\"Secret To The End\\" and \\"Goodbye\\"? I personally liked \\"Always\\"--one of the bonus tracks.<br /><br />It just that \\"Delta Machine\\" feels labored, much like their previous albums. Also, and I know I'll take heat for this, the band isn't pushing the limits of their creativity anymore. They seem content to just twiddle knobs and create sonic layer upon sonic layer of textured synths and sounds. I respect the fact they are not making 'hits' any more, but as a fan I still sort of want some hits please. \\"Delta Machine\\" is consistent and cohesive, but it lacks character and individuality. I sometimes wonder if the band have nothing left to offer their fans at this point. What's more, they put out an album every four years so that by the time the new album comes out we've forgotten the last one and like suckers we want something 'new' and thus buy them all over again without demanding more from them.<br /><br />So, \\"Delta Machine\\" for me, gets three and a half stars. Above average, solid, but not exactly memorable, and not exactly going to make you want to run to your cd collection and put it on when you could just as easily put on \\"Some Great Reward\\", \\"Black Celebration\\", \\"Music For The Masses\\", \\"Violator\\" or \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion\\" instead and be satiated and rewarded for doing so.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Delta Machine\\" compares to Depeche Mode's other works:<br /><br />1981 Speak & Spell: Three Stars<br />1982 A Broken Frame: Three and a Half Stars<br />1983 Construction Time Again: Three Stars<br />1984 Some Great Reward: Four Stars<br />1986 Black Celebration: Five Stars<br />1987 Music For The Masses: Five Stars<br />1990 Violator: Five Stars<br />1993 Songs Of Faith And Devotion: Five Stars<br />1997 Ultra: Three and a Half Stars<br />2001 Exciter: Three and a Half Stars<br />2005 Playing The Angel: Three and a Half Stars<br />2009 Sounds Of The Universe: Three and a Half Stars<br />2013 Delta Machine: Three and a Half Starsshing the limits of their creativity anymore.

0452295548|5.0|Dr. Taylor's continuing insights (see You Tube and her Web site as well) on the operations of the brain are incredibly useful to those of us trying to tweak our own nervous systems.
B0017SWPXY|2.0|What I thought was going to be a charming story turned out to be more of what we hear and read in the daily news.....illness,death and charges of molestation.  I did learn something about racing in the rain, both literally and metaphorically.  The author did write about tenacity and loyalty, both saving features of this story.
B0019IB0II|3.0|It's really this writer's voice that's my problem... the story is really interesting, but her language is often redundant and a little too &#34;mind spirit connection&#34; - ey for my taste. I bet a lot of people would like it, though, I just didn't.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|this is a prequel to Spartacus-  it sets out the premis of the series- introduces some of the characters - others are lost -  lots of action , blood , sex and language  who knew they used the f  word at that time<br />certainly not for the faint of heart<br />but apparantly typical for ancient Rome - re sex and debauchery
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I actually liked this one better than Kite Runner. It's well written, just a great story. Really sucks you in!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my horse is a really cool realistic app. it has great graphics and is fun to play but every now and then it will freeze but then it goes back to the game. overall my horse is really good and fun to play. I would recommend it to all horse people
B0097HSS4M|5.0|It really is superb. I love taking photos with friends and family, editing them, and sharing for all to see.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I don't buy many games, but this one was worth it! No time limits or penalties, good story line, hints when stuck, and great graphics.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This is one of those things you read just because history calls it a classic. And it's worth it. Whether you are reading it to kids or using it as a metal diversion, the fanciful land and characters are very memorable. Behind the fictitious scenario is some interesting commentary on human nature.
0547848412|5.0|Not many of us would dare to subject ourselves to be stranded in the middle of the ocean, simply for the purpose of a journey to self-discovery. It's tough business, and, thank you very much, we're comfortable in our houses and cars and we love our refrigerators full of food and water, and out TV's in the living room, and... You get the picture. Writers are these weird creatures that have this ability, to subject themselves to the horrors of starvation and thirst and uttermost human suffering, all without leaving their bedroom, only to help us open our own eyes, help us look inside and remember what's important in this life. Remember why we live, why we love, why we breathe.<br /><br />LIFE OF PI is precisely this kind of book, one exquisite dash that starts in lavishly colored Indian zoo, speeds through a tangle of every possible religion you can thinks of, lands on a ship and proceeds to showcase the horrible juxtaposition of man against nature, magnificence against pitiful cowardice, the vastness and overwhelming glory of life against small and greedy and at times horrific need for plain survival. It's told from the point of view of a sixteen year old Piscine Patel, or, as the title of the book says, Pi for short. It is told by Pi himself many years later, to a novelist who is searching for his next story. The prose structure is simple, yet rich with words that will take your breath away and make you reach for the dictionary, all the while snickering and outright laughing, because the book is chock-full of good humor, jokes about three-toed sloths included.<br /><br />Don't watch the movie yet, read the book first. The last line made me cry like a baby, it was simply the perfect ending, and immediately I wanted to read the book again. And I will. And you should do. It's beautiful.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|I chose this book because of descriptions like &#34;magnificent historical epic&#34; and &#34;richly developed characters.&#34; While the scope of this book is certainly sweepingly historical, the depth is non-existent. The prose simply describes what the characters are doing, when they are doing it, and why. There is no subtlety, nothing left to the imagination, and the characters are as interesting as a cardboard cut-out. This would be more appropriate as a historical primer for 3rd graders to encourage them to learn about WW1. As an adult, I found it to be insultingly bland.
B003XDZN8A|5.0|I find they fit snug.  I know a lot of people said they were a loose fit but mine are somewhat tight.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|Actually bought this book by mistake - and it really was a mistake.  I kept it because others seemed to enjoy it, but I thought it was boring - a real waste of $8.
B003DNN0L2|3.0|I believe this director has a following however I wouldn't be among them. It was disjointed throughout and ended strangely. I sure wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to friends.
B001458MI2|4.0|This album shows the range of her voice and style. The price was right too. I have to write five more words.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive it is also like temple run but more fun and simple to if your parents or kids wants to play
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I love the game. it keeps my mind and eye looking and thinking.  At 64 I need something that is entertaining but not overly difficult.  This can get hard at times trying to manuever objects into the right place but it gives me hours of enjoyment. I would recommend this to friends!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The graphics on this game are very very great. To choose from a select variaty of boards and the characters arr really neat to. I announce this game 2012 Tablet Game of the year!<br /><br />~O.Kelly<br />CEO Gamer Headquarters
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great quality viewing and so happy to find it available!! Couldn't get it on Netflix and I think the 3rd season comes out on Amazon later this year.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game I hope they make a second one of the game. I especially because of the world tour and how it updates by its self the only problem is that it sometimes freezes and you cant keep the limated ofers during the world tour.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this addicting game, my 4 year old baby doll loves to play it! She always steals it and I have to take it away from her. Her birthday is in March she turns five. That's an old baby doll. She also loves to play it with Britney spears
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Kids love it and so do we keeps them occupied for hours especially on road trips. I would highly recommend this game to anyone
B00013M6NK|5.0|The battery charges very quickly and the charge lasts and lasts. Product was used in subfreezing temperatures for multiple hours at a time over the period of a full day in the snow. Used the HD Video function as well. This was a great value seeing as I saw the same product for a higher price in other places. This is the OEM replacement part. I would buy this item again. I am a happy customer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful series<br /><br />This is a great series.  Start from the beginning with Season one and savor the characters and the storyline.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|If you are the type of person who likes strategy or games like Battle Pirates wich takes some patience but amazing gameplay then I recommend trying this game out. If you do get the game add me if you see me in the online section KSI Marcus.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an awesome series.  I got so involved I could not put any of the books down.  As I finished each book, I could not wait for the next.  I kept wanting more.
B00005JN0T|5.0|I received this product quite promptly in the condition that was promised.<br />Packaging and product was intact, no damage or scratches on disc.<br />I would recommend to anyone.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|Being a Lord of the Rings fan, I did'nt know if Peter Jackson could pull this one off, but he did, and I can't wait to see the next one...
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is comprehensive and has consistant up to date information on not only local but any other city that may be important to you.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive. How many times can people &#34; murmur&#34; or &#34;mutter&#34; instead of speak. If the writing were more interesting, these books would have been sexy.
B008QLXSG8|3.0|An utterly unsympathetic protaganist meanders through the end of his sullen existance while standing fully resolute against any possibility that he is responsible for it's dispicable conclusion. If only he had died at the end of the first paragraph. Then the reader would have been spared the agony of trying to care about him, which in the end proves impossible!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It's a well done flick but has many failings. Suffice to say scientists (educated people) would not act the way they were portrayed in the movie, and decisions would not have been made by many other &#34;real people&#34; in similar circumstances. I'm well aware movies must attract a large audience but regardless of how much money one has, and no matter how much faith, the story was merely OK for me.
1451695187|5.0|I am usually skeptical about books concerning Heaven.  But this one is wonderful.  I could easily picture in my mind the scenario being explained by the author as he went up to Heaven and then back to Earth.  It is a fascinating read.  We have passed it around at church and everyone is enthralled by it.  Dr. Alexander's  faith is awesome.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and hope Ben A lives an accident free long, safe and prosperous life.<br /><br />Being retired military I've known of many clandestine operations, (think Grenada and Just Cause) as a result I've been on the side of lies and semi-lies called distractions. Allow me to just say the details are absolutely astounding. Argo merely represented one.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I got this movie to go along with my trilogy of Batman. Lots of action and good plot that keeps you interested.
B00AA0U046|5.0|I've been a Jimmy Hendrix fan since the 70's. it's great to see his unpublished music come to vinyl again...I am not taking this particular item out of the package since it is a collectable. I have heard the cd and I love the songs,Signiture Hendrix..Often you wonder if the songs on these type of albums are not published because they aren't up to snuff.  Not this time though.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This is one great action movie that delivers that hard core U.S. Military punch that we all love to see. I hope they make a part 2 to this.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|What a wonderful gem of a movie!  Not at all what I was expecting...great plot...a totally different take on other stories similar to this..it is not preditable...it is very cute...it is a very fun movie!  I highly recommend!
B0067R0APK|4.0|I was expecting a few new bells and whistles but the best improvement was loosing the ads. The app seemed cluttered AMD a lot of redundant simi-copies of the same info. Was disappointed, expected more
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This is an incredible awesome movie!  Amaaaaazing special effects!  Great story!  Just absolutely incredible!  Beautifully done.  I can't believe the tiger is not real and is computer generated!  Beautiful scenes!  Edge of your seat movie.  I was in awe through the whole thing!  This is one of those movies that you want to make sure you have you something to drink and some popcorn or something and go to the bathroom first because you will not even want to pause it for a sec!
B00B22IJXK|5.0|With a touch or a simple brush selection images can be turned into abstracts or pictures ready to share. Again, keep on taking photos and then play with them later.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|A little goofy, sometimes predictable...but really very fun!  The graphics could be a little better, but it has some great scenes in it!  I will enjoy watching it again.
B007BT0RKG|5.0|This app is easy to use and is best enjoyed while parked or planning a trip. The information is concise and the software is easy to use.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|The special effects are incredible!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Some of the movie is predictable, but it is still such a fun movie to watch.  It will be in the top of my favorites to watch again.
1451696191|4.0|\\"I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we come from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them.\\" -Charlie in \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\"<br /><br />My first impressions of this one were that it was an easy, entertaining read. You want to move on to the next letter from Charlie. You want to find out how things turn out with Charlie. You want to find out what he does next.<br /><br />And you'll keep flipping the pages.<br /><br />I am, however, a bit flummoxed by how the powers-that-be have declared this novel a timeless classic so soon after publication. The novel has several references to \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" and if that is the standard by which this novel is to be compared, there is a glaring difference: Holden Caulfield is real. His demeanor, his comments, his actions, everything about him breathes adolescent trying to discover who he is. Charlie is more of an abstract. He's what I think parents want a teenager just entering high school to be like: he loves to read and get good grades and gets out-of-school assignments from his English teacher, if the wind blows in the wrong direction he weeps, he's sensitive with girls, he loves his Mom and declares he's buying her a present on his birthday...just because, well, he's such a swell guy. Charlie isn't completely infallible; he screws up with girls and he experiments with cigarettes and marijuana...what teenage boy hasn't done these things? That felt real. So did the interactions of Charlie's family; the reaction of his sister to the situation with her boyfriend, the family's support of his big brother who becomes a football star, the holidays, his grandfather.<br /><br />Other aspects of the novel that irked me: first, I can't figure who Charlie was writing the letters to. I thought we'd get closure to that in the epilogue. Instead, we got the best quote of the entire novel, which I included to start this review. Second, Charlie's new crowd; I'm sorry, but the girls who were known as \\"blow queens\\" (former or not) in my high school would not suddenly take up with the school freak. No, no, no. And the fact that another pretty senior is obsessed with our little man Charlie, sorry, but again, not going to happen. It does add to the conflict of the novel, and makes the end wrap up with that \\"feel good\\" emotion we were all expecting, but it isn't real. Again, abstract; you're a nerd, and what nerd's best outcome wouldn't be to enter high school, your only friend having committed suicide recently, and have two wealthy kids take you in to their click where you get to meet girls and experiment with drugs.<br /><br />The bottom line: this is a good easy read that will remind most of us a lot about those years when everything seemed awkward and that date you had that weekend and that invitation to that party seemed like the greatest events ever. Of course, we all grow up and realize our follies of that mine field called high school and we get a glimpse of what that's like by the end of this novel. I'd say \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is worth reading but don't go into it expecting a \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" Do go into it expecting to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />-Raeden Zenhe best quote of the entire novel, which I included to start this review.

1419703692|5.0|Thanks
B003EVWDR0|1.0|I sat through this one time because it was a christmas gift.  It is so dumbed down, that I couldn't watch it all the way through a second time.  It has a predictable plot and no character development.  It relies exclusively on visual effects and action.  I watched portions of it a couple more times successfully by turning off the volume.  It's sheep fodder.
0316228532|5.0|Daughter is a fan of J.K. Rowling. Of course this is not what one is used to with this author, but very intriguing read.

B005HSL626|5.0|my 2 year old grandson loves this game and i do to, a game for all ages. i recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book sort of takes me back to high school 60 years ago when I read Twains &#34;CT Yankee in King Arthur's Court&#34; and felt I had discovered a whole new interest and outlook about reading.  I have sold many copies of this book to friends and relatives based on my encouragement to try a new author with a great new concept. Wonderful piece of work<br /><br />Jerry
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i love this game. very addicting even my husband that hates to play games plays this game. play it daily. found nothing so far that is scam game
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I enjoy it as a break from word and rpg games. Love the sound effects for each house! Classic and enjoyable.
B000286RKW|5.0|Always loved this movie.  Copy be bought when it first came out several years back went bad from watching so much.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I kept waiting for this book to get better. It never did for me. It had far too many medical terms for the average public.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My grandson loves this game,he is 4 but he can figure the game out.He would play it all day if I would let him.
B006ZEEHQS|3.0|First, I didn't hate the movie. I liked the movie for what it was but, having read the book, there was no way I could love this movie.<br /><br />Let me say, the casting was mostly spot on and I feel the people they selected very much matched the characters in the book.  They did a great job in this aspect.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment comes with the fact that the screen play writers manipulated the plot when that was never the point of the story.  It was a diary or a journal, a collection of thoughts and events in the mans life and it didn't need a central hidden plot.<br /><br />My second biggest disappointment comes from completely removing Fritz Yeamon from the movie. He had the largest role in the book and merging aspects of his character to suit the manipulated plot really turns me off and I'm sure there are many purists that feel the same way.<br /><br />The people behind the scenes that worked on this movie, they could have had \\"The Breakfast Club\\" Meets \\"Continental Divide\\" but, instead they settled for another average story that will be lost in a sea of average movie.<br /><br />Now, if you've never read the book, you will probably really like the movie but, if you have, go in with a grain of salt as this is not the same exact story that probably made you want to see the movie in the first place.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Unbelievably excellent movie!  Super good in 3D!!!  One of the best ever.  Beautiful cinematography. I will watch it many more times.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this story line. When you begin this book you think it's just another teen romance  with the unbelievably gorgeous leading man and the &#34;I'm not going to fall in love with him&#34; leading lady. As you read, though, the story evolves into so much more. There's such an engaging plot hidden within Holder's (the leading man) mood swings and Sky's (the leading lady) reluctance to trust him.<br />You don't get the full explanation until you're 80% into the book but the build up will definitely hold your attention. Hopeless is a must read.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I ordered this product for my son and he is very satisfied. The product was in good condition and there are no complaints. Thank you!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a lot like Minecraft for computer so far and the best part is that Mojang is making so many updates<br />so get ready for so much more in the coming months. How can any one not like this game? So if you LOVE this game your going to love it more! Credit to Mojang. THANKS MOJANG!!! : )
B008XG1X18|5.0|So many ideas, so little time. Plan your wedding, bake a cake, have a party, decorate your house, laugh ( a lot) . All on your lunch break!
B005HSL626|5.0|Lots of fun with three ways to play! I've unlocked a lot of different swords and backgrounds with only a couple days of play!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This is a great book! Very passionate ! I like how the author uses Ky`s point of view along with Cassia`s. It's very adventurous.The book keeps you on your toes to find out what happens next. Once you start reading , you will be hooked! For sure!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|The best book ever<br /> I've never read anything like this. It's a real page turner<br />I can't wait to start the next book
1878424319|5.0|Everyone below has already mentioned all the wonderful attributes of this book.  All I will say is that this book was life changing for me!  It is also a quick read (for those of us that are turned off my big books).  I bought the companion book that goes with this book.  I highly recommend it as well.  It really enhanced my reading experience.
B009AOFNU4|5.0|I didn't really get this for my Android, but I decided to try it out. Angry Birds didn't work and I didn't see anything on their compatibility list that looked interesting. The buttons did work to simulate the home and back buttons, but it wasn't really useful to keep paired. For the PC however it worked great and the SteelSeries software that I downloaded from the manufacture let me customize it for all sorts of different apps. My favorite was actually setting it up for Adobe Lightroom with the arrows being next/previous photo the buttons for rating and the triggers for copy and paste effects. It's sped up my culling workflow tremendously.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Small & Light<br />+ Cordless & Rechargeable<br />+ Customization<br />+ Bluetooth<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Limited Android use
B00B23O96A|1.0|Very disappointed in this one...not one good song for me.my husband and I are Eric Clapton fans but this is very different from his other albums.
B0064QNS62|1.0|I don't like this game. Its hard to navigate with the controls they have set up for use. Its set up as if you have a joystick. If the maker changes this feature then maybe it would be wortb playing.
B003L16FAE|5.0|im laughing at all the whiners moaning about subtle issues. no grain! baah! they are just ridiculous, BUT, that is the internet for you. nothing but nit picking and complaining. boohoo, they like grain with there whine. too bad they cant see and appreciate that they seriously cleaned up this movie to look awesome and CLEAR, not super fuzzy and ridiculously dated like it did on the original bluray. the UHE bluray not only has all the special features from the DVD but has an amazing looking print of the film that makes I hard to go back to the fuzzy grainy, in other words crappy version that came out before. excellent transfer, so all the complainers well, they are the ones missing out. my advice, GO GET IT!
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app!  always current &amp; always accurate. I've had no problems--just good info.<br /><br />really like the specificity to immediate locale.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|\\"Let It Be...Naked\\" was hardly an improvement over \\"Let It Be\\". As many of the reviewers have mentioned, it's just different. I just imagine it's an extra disc in the \\"Anthology 3\\" CD set. Some of the alternates are interesting, but I really expected one thing I didn't get; \\"Dig A Pony\\" with the 2 \\"all I want is you\\" parts restored to the intro and outro. Nothing special here, but still worthwhile. I would have preferred EMI to release the Glyn Johns produced \\"Get Back\\" album with that slightly interesting \\"Fly On The Wall\\" disc replaced by a disc of the complete performance from the Apple roof on 30 January 1969. Maybe if the \\"Fly On The Wall\\" disc was indexed I might have listened to it more often. As it is, it's just a mash up of snippets.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|like photoshop kind of! I love it.wub wub wub screeeecccchhh! wub wub wub doooooOOOOooooo[...]  but really this is an awesome apply.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Liked it,,, stumbled across this book when I was trying out your library. Very satisfying read! Recommend to all readers!
B0087EACJK|5.0|I am really enjoying the game. It's easy to play and pretty addicting. I like the number of levels. Means the game isn't over too quickly
B000GBEWHA|5.0|I bought this movie for my nephew who has Downs Syndrome.  He had a copy and absolutely wore it out!  He loves the dancing part most of all, since he, too, dances.  Thanks for keeping Grease available--with John Travolta!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is not like the others where it's a small horse and you have to build shops but in the app you actually get to interact with the horse and that's why I enjoy it so much.....fantastic
B009FZFONO|5.0|I was first attracted to this series because it is filmed where I live but was drawn in by the great characters and stories.  I watched 3 seasons in a short time span and join everyone waiting for season 4.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I didn't expect the DVD to be as spectacular as the theater experience, but with the improved sound balance - which you will notice in the very first scene - I came away just as emotionally spent!  This is the one DVD I can't do without!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|So far it is a great game. It has kept me wanting more. I hope they are not going to make me pay after this.
B000001GAM|5.0|For those of us who watched Carlo Maria Giulini bring class to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, I was expecting a more docile and refined approach to this particular symphony.  But at the helm of the VPO for this recording, you are immediately confronted with the fire and sonic force Bruckner's 9th requires, and MORE!  Yet, the refinement and sublime clarity that Giulini has been known for is expressed ever so masterfully in the soft and openly vulnerable passages that showcases the incredible musicianship this orchestra has always been capable of.  This rendition of the work is as good as it gets!
B0036G1T78|4.0|A bookish regular-type movie star looking kinda guy goes out to lunch and comes back to the office to find his colleagues slaughtered like fish in a barrel.  There are nasty foreign people behind all this.<br />The regular movie-star looking guy finds himself with no choice but to kidnap a movie star looking kinda gal and handcuff her to the bed.  They do not initially have sex.  Whether they ultimately do or not is for you to find out.<br />The good guys are not all that good but they are clever and some are very bad.<br />Good clean fun.
B005OK722U|1.0|I had heard Hostel 3 was crap but refused to believe it as I really liked the first one and thought the second one was alright too but this really was garbage. The whole movie screams 'cheap' in every aspect so much so it would be fair to assume the vast majority of the supposed $6 million budget went towards buying the franchise naming rights to slap on the front cover. It's like a midday movie version of Hostel and was so bad I felt compelled to do this review as a public service.<br /><br />I would've given it no stars if I could have.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|I got finished watching this DVD, and it will get many more views.<br />I am so glad that I purchased this DVD, it so informative.<br />And, they are correct about me not seeing my food the same.<br />I had no idea all this control was going on with our food.<br />People need to be more aware of this so that we can all get healthier.<br />It is our God given right to be healthy, to eat healthy foods and to be protected by the FDA.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Get ready to be touched and worship Jesus Christ in spirit and truth. This album will be  another huge success for Darlene and Israel (to the glory of God)<br /><br />Israel Houghton is the producer, writer, and co-writer of this amazing project, being the first production for his very own company. You can watch him talk about it in TBN's Praise the Lord show aired on 4/5/2013. His story about him and Darlene writing \\"In Jesus Name\\" (minute 1:29) is very powerful.<br /><br />Darlene's voice and stage presence are a true gift.<br /><br />Get it!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The actors are awesome. The special effects are good but the story lines are what is best, as it should be.
B005KH928E|5.0|Marsalis and Eric are the perfect combination. I am a big fan of Eric Clapton, as always he delivers excellency and top quality
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|This is a fairly solid point and click adventure with ok puzzles and a reasonably interesting story.  The difficulty is just right so you don't need to run for a walkthrough, and the in game hints help you along if  you get really stuck without spoiling anything to much.  Just se the hint titles was enough to get my gears turning most of the time .<br /><br />Only complaint I can really make is that there  is a little inconsistency on where the arrows to click that move you along show up.  There are a couple of rooms that seem a little hard to navigate because of this.  Also, the last chapter is a bit heavy on busy work for my taste.<br /><br />Overall, worth the price for the couple hours of fun I got out of it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game. I have it on my I phone too! I cannot wait to unlock the black foal but it will take a while
0375869026|5.0|This is a brilliant book that I think is great for all ages - well written and entertaining to the end
B009X00E18|4.0|I had been shopping around for several months for the exact case for our new fire.  I like that the height of the angle can be adjusted to reduce glare.  It's sturdy without adding too much extra weight.  We have enjoyed the automatic sleep/wake feature.  the only thing i wish was different is where the power cord ends up.  if you want to charge while using the fire you either have to remove the fire and rotate the camera to the bottom, or use the case in the less than optimal orientation.  I dont know that this is the fault of the case though, more a feature of the kindle design.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty fun. It keeps my attention along with my sister's. I think this is a good game for all ages.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|Almost right at the end. Hidden object task and simply wouldn't let me pick up the boomerang. Cannot go any further so very frustrating
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app so much I highly reccomend it.......if your like me and love to take pictures and do cool things to them.....get it!!!!!:)
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|decent graphics and story line.  the guide was very helpful (which I usually need). good mix of hog and other mini games.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Well, I really love this app. It's really fast, there are only a few minor bugs, and its pretty much awesome. One thing I don't like is that you need to type in their exact username to find one of your friends and add them as a contact. Other than that, ME LOVES IT!
B001GA1RFA|4.0|Unique and interesting characters make for a fun read with a good message. Colin's quest for answers to failed young romance leads him to  a new self awareness. We get to fill in the blanks about what may be for Colin. I'd like the story to go on - a sign I liked the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome,addicting and fun to play and every time I get hit by a train I'm like \\"that's going to leave a mark!\\"<br />This might not be a very good review because I'm a 6 year-old girl
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis were relatively unknown until Thrift Shop blew up. So glad they're getting the recognition they deserve. Talented artists!
B005T87QCI|5.0|Its very fun but Atom is not a good fighter. Mitus is and Noisy Boy are good fighters. There are ups and downs to the game but if you like \\"fighting robots\\" you will s*** your pants!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just full of fun and addicting!.. I love that the world/destination changes after a few weeks or months, because after a while the same place will bore you, and I love how the obstacles always change whenever you \\"get caught\\" and try again lol.. I will love this game always<br />Plus it's easy and fun enough for my 5yr old niece to play n love it too so that's also a plus... Overall, its just pure awesome
B0091REZMW|3.0|Moderately entertaining, but fairly limited without buying more diamonds. You can play for free, but don't expect to complete timed quests.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I have read the book, but I haven't seen the movie yet. I'm so hoping that the movie is as good.
B005PV81MS|4.0|Even if you can't wrap your ears around the \\"Souf Wondin\\" (South London) accents spoken by the actors like they have marbles in their mouths, then don't worry. There is plenty of good action and nice interplay between all the actors here.<br /><br />Just in case you're wondering why all the action occurs around a singular apartment building and not the entire \\"block,\\" it's a Britglish. The block refers to that building known as a tower block (think the projects on the South Side of Chicago and you'll get the picture).<br /><br />Anyway, the creatures are terrifying as rabid aliens. The kids are first-rate in their ability to band together and defend their block. There is also a terrific social commentary on the state of Britain snuck in based on the interplay between the police and the kids. Also, be forewarned the start of the movie which contains no aliens is a pretty sinister mugging that you wonder if you've got the right movie.<br /><br />The extras are worth getting the DVD for. There's a full hour on the making of the movie and it's beyond terrific. There's a full four more extras thrown in as well on the movie including a reason why a huge chunk was not filmed at all after being storyboarded and location scouted.
1402793375|5.0|This book is just amazing. The tragedy of the life and death of so many men, women, and children, all because of greed.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I agree with all the other 5 star reasons.  great visual, fun building up shark levels, for free it's super.  one thing, it gives me motion sickness &amp; you need to take breaks.  weird.  otherwise it 's a lot of fun.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Great music, What happened? What went wrong for someone to have such talent fall through the cracks? Greed on other people's part? Attt
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved Suzanne's 2nd book of the Hunger Games series. This is my very favorite of all three books.  I reread them all the time, especially around the time the movies are coming out.  Love the tension between Haymitch, Peeta, Katness, and President Snow.  Interesting triangle with Peeta, Katniss, and Gale as well.  Brutal fighting in the arena also keeps you reading late into he night.
B00BU2SIW4|1.0|Not even close to what they use to put out.  Exciter was the end of the depeche mode I knew
B008P1EWIM|5.0|it's. pretty and functional!  I travel for business and I can check all the places I go.  Even Europe.  Accurate. Makes packing much easier.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A Wanted Man by Lee Child is an explosive thriller with very interesting and memorable dialogue. It all takes place in the Mid-West with a murder at a defunct water pumping station. Four agencies are involved from the FBI, CIA, State Department and the Department of Homeland Security. From page one we see Jack Reacher hitch a ride on the Interstate with two men and a woman in a Chevy Impala traveling east. Jack is sporty a broken nose. He is asked by one of the man what happen to his nose and Jack replies, &#34;Oh that...I ran into a closed door.&#34; Then from then on you begin to wonder what is going on here? The body count climbs and witnesses are placed in a safe house for their own safety. Of course Jack doesn't really like it. He is like a caged animal. The rest of the story is packed with action that leaps off the pages. So I will not reveal anything further but to say if you are a Jack Reacher fan &#34;A Wanted Man&#34; is a must read. Early on in the story Jack tells one of the bad guys, &#34;Can you talk for a minute without using the letter A?&#34; I know now how you can do it for it is revealed on the last page but I can understand why Jack worked it into the conversation while driving cross country at over 90 miles an hour on the Interstate. Yes it could have been a misdirection poly or to change the subject of the conversation but then if you read this highly suspenseful novel you will find out in good time. I strongly recommend the story. I love it! I can now see how Lee Child is considered a top master of suspense... yes indeed.
B00BF11STU|4.0|time then it's a great movie put your constantly traveling in a car on a plane and you have me distractions they may not be as good of a choice for you because of all the names and places that you'll be have to be constantly keeping up with and all the distractions makes it that much harder but besides that I believe it's a great movie!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This is a true story and only the names have been changed to protect the identities of those who were involved. Benjamin Franklin wrote in his Poor Richard's Almanac  &#34;Three may keep a secret, if two of them are dead.” This is the central theme of this fabulous story. In a nutshell Argo is a story of how the CIA and Hollywood pulled off the most audacious rescue in history in the middle of a revolution in Iran. Although Argo has recently been released as a movie I strongly recommend reading this book too! The book will give you much insight in how six diplomats hiding in Tehran, Iran were rescued. The idea of the mission to rescue these six Americans trapped in Iran was conceived by Antonio Mendez. It was then planned, directed and executed by countless personnel of the CIA and Canada. The successful outcome of the extraction of these six Americans posing as Canadians remained a secret for countless years after. In fact much of the details and those involved is still a secret. But the story is how a film production company that never existed stood up made a film as a cover to rescue these Americans who were in harms way. Again I strongly recommend reading Argo. You will go places you have never gone before and probably for the normal person you will never be given the opportunity to do so but this is good because we are talking about life and death here. Where the bad guys will not hesitate to chop your head off after unbelievable torture. It is good that America has people who will do such things even though the risk will be out of this world. God bless them all and God bless these United States of America!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game, easy to play and has just enough challenge to keep it interesting. Great game to play while in the car or in a waiting room.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|All these books are great, if a bit frustrating jumping from one character to another. That said, I can not wait for the next book- I've been through the available books in the series and am making do with the TV show.
B00BU2TEGS|5.0|It's not as good as classic depeche but its better than sounds of universe and exciter .. Slow songs are well composed and fast song have a great melody .. For those who don't like this album , you need to listen to it a couple of more times I listened 5 times and now I like 9 out of the 13 tracks ..I'm glad depeche mode can still carry a tune
B009KEN87O|5.0|Really fun never the same game. Like playing an old atari but with more ai. It is a fun game
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|This review its for the 13 song album i have not listen to the. Deluxe album .. at first I was a little nervous about this album at first , after sotu I thought they had finally reach that moment were a artist runs out of great songs and melodies.. Don't get me wrong old depeche mode it's always going to be the best but I have to place this album as the best 3 release they had this millennium First its ultra  second its playing the angel and now delta machine then exciter  and last would be sounds of the universe.. Delta machine dint got  me on this first listen , the first song I recognize was heaven , which its a nice melody , the second song that got to me was soothe my soul, the welcome to my world became addicting. The chorus towards the end makes the song really good, then broken got my attention after that slow,became a favorite specially if you are getting intimate with someone, then it's angel which reminds me of clean  then should be higher and soft touch raw nerve are easy in the ears not classics but catchy and last song it's goodbye very bluesy but after a couple of listening you begin  to appreciate  it.. I left out 4 songs that don't really hold my interest for now  in comparison. To exciter  and sound of the universe this album it's a move towards the right direction and I look forward now to see them in concert .. After 33 years this guys deserve the respect they earned the influence so many musicians today and I'm proud to be a old fan and still believe in their talent
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|Well acted; kudos to Director !Had seen before wanted film for library; I'm saving some words for next rating effort!
0307951529|3.0|This is a book that seeks toget your juices going. It's filled with stories of people who started their own micro-businesses and are living the dream. I guess I just don't see it that way. Let's look at some of the author's core principles<br /><br />1 - Avoid the hassle of growth. His idea is that small businesses that allow you to make a $50k per year income is where it's at. Don't hire staff.<br />My problem with this is that with a 1-person shop you are just an employee. You get paid while you work. If you can't work for some reason - illness for example - you don't get paid.<br /><br />2 - You can do it with $100<br />Many if not most of the people profiled in this book did not start a business with $100. A coffee shop costs more than $100 to set up. So does a camera kit, a website, or a plane ticket anywhere.<br /><br />3 - Anyone can do it.<br />Maybe anyone theoretically can do it. That being said the author spends a lot of time talking about people that had long professional careers before ditching it all to start a business. Having a few hundred thousand of savings to start out certainly helps your prospects.<br /><br />I don't know - maybe I am being a bit too harsh. If you are a young entrepreneur, maybe you can be helped by this book. I like that it has a bias towards action rather than exhaustive analysis. That being said, it is very light on detail and you are going to have to do a lot more hard work than perhaps is described in this book.
B00536OCZA|3.0|I was a little disappointed to find that my brand new, sealed record had a few scratches in it, but it had to have happened at the press so I guess that's just the way things are these days.  I've listened to the album a few times already and heck if I can tell when I'm listening to a scratched spot, so I guess I don't really mind.  I'm very pleased to have a copy of this album; It was either spend ~$25 on a new press, or $20 on an original beat up copy.  I'm not a terrible stickler for originality so this was a no brainer for me.<br /><br />edit 8/15/14:  after a while I have some complaints about things to which I was blind from my initial excitement.  First, and I noticed this the first time but didn't think much of it, is that the record is warped.  There's a significant \\"high spot\\", which I've seen before with some thinner 40 year old records but am surprised to find in a new heavy weight pressing. I figure it's a manufacturing / curing issue, which is too bad.  Normally this wouldn't bother me but the warp is so severe and localized that my cartridge almost bottoms out over it, and the ride makes the needle bounce so much that I can clearly visually witness dramatic speaker excursion in the ~8hz range (this is how I finally realized it was an issue) which can't be good for the cartridge, my amplifier or my speakers.<br /><br />The other gripe developed after listening to the album with headphones.  Much of the higher frequencies are textured with distortion, and stereo imaging seems to come and go, both of which again I attribute to a low quality manufacturing issue.  I've attempted to thoroughly clean my brand new record in some specific trouble spots to no avail;  perhaps whatever master this was copied from is itself dirty, 'cuz it ain't me or my equipment.<br /><br />just because it's heavyweight doesn't mean it's automatically better.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke has written a wonderful piece of Science Fiction here.  An insightful look into the future of Earth's population, the story is believable.  That is what makes it such a good book to sit in your favorite chair with.  I have not read a lot of Clarke's work, but this book has convinced me to read more of his work.  Its a quick read, not to heavy on the technological terms.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|One of best Reachers!  Should have read this one first to get a good feel for the later Reacher books.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|You can't go wrong with any of the ice age movies. We have almost the whole collection, and they have been watched many times.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Who doesn't love this CD? i wore out my old cassette and decided to replace it with a CD. Incredible songs that bring me back to my teenage years. When i first got this cassette, i took it to bed with me every night in my little portable cassette player and played it over and over and over. Couldn't get enough. Still can't. Carole King is an icon!
B002VECM6S|5.0|Great movie!  I watch this over and over.  Grat story featuring great actors and actresses.  I would highly recommend it!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This is a good movie, history-wise.  But very boring.  I kept falling asleep,<br />which bothered me because I love Lincoln and was looking forward to a better movie.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Challenging enough to be interesting but not impossible. You have to get each train into their respective stations while avoiding horrific crashes. Sometimes you have to stop and load gold from the bank on your way to the station. My daughter and I love this game! The sound effects are awesome for the inevitable train crashes! The developer(s) did a great job and I hope they make more!
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Great casting, acting and very entertaining.  The best part is the message.<br />A movie everyone should see.  I usually don't watch movies more than once,<br />but I would watch this again.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I was hoping that this would be better.  I thought most of the acting was good, but script and technical issues took me out of the movie.  I found the camera motion to be distracting due to fast and persistent camera motion.  The action scenes were uninspired and cartoony.<br /><br />The trolls, orcs, and goblins didn't have the same menace because they were in a sense humanized.  They just didn't seem evil.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Very good I love to use helps me with words I didn't know before<br />I recommend this dictionary to anyone.<br />llloooovvvee it
B0091REZMW|1.0|What I really did not like about this game besides what all the other one star reviews discuss is that you can not zoom in the scenes in order to see the SUPER small items.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Got the full game for only $0.99.  Great graphics and sound.  Good story to keep things moving along.  Would definitely recommend.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Am a Masterpiece junkie esp Downton Abbey.  Can't wait for season 4.  Have had no problems with any of the cd's etc ordered from you,

B00BWJARHO|5.0|Been a long time since the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This movie satisfies and upholds the tradition for fans.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. It's great for new recipes to try, new chic outfits, and creative arts & crafts. I always get new ideas from pintrist, and always find myself saying, \\"I wish I thought of this!\\" But anyway great app for your free time.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I am a big McEwan fan and was disappointed with this book.  Lightweight and not very like able characters.  Had to force myself to stay with the book until the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so look awesome if I could marry it I would I really like the design and the characters!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game so much that I put it on all my devices.  I like that it is a little puzzle.  ( written by Gavin age 6 with Aspergers.)
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Initially addictive, now not so much.  Love the sound effects, but they drive the hubby crazy.  It's free, what do you want?
0553062182|5.0|This book has been invaluable for understanding the people who are sensitive to all types of stimuli. It's been one of the best helps in understanding emotional and physical responses in these types of people. It's well written and well organized.

1936608898|5.0|I lost 22 Lbs. the first month. Followed the 30 day plan. My husband started eating more like me after seeing the results. I have loaned my book to my daughter and had an other one sent to my Sister who lives in another state. Its not the weight she wants to lose as much as her digestive system is out of whack. We are convinced she will be helped.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoyed the story and am looking forward to reading the stories to follow.<br />I thought it was well written and is an interesting futuristic society/human spirit topic.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I use it on my phone and my pad to access my work computer. Everything works perfectly. You need to subscribe to an access pack to use it over 3g/4g or over a network different from the computer you want to access. It's only a couple of bucks a month and it's worth it.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I love playing this game to kill time. My one and only complaint is I wish they would update with more puzzles.
0792844793|5.0|There's a brand of peanut butter with  3 redheaded kid's cartoon faces as fresh, pure, and delicous, but I know a guy of that ginger variety who'd say it more like fresh, smooth and so-f'n-sauve, I call him Mr Blue Velvet PB.
B008HK3TXK|5.0|This is a great product!  It is completely functional AND nice to look at.  The Lola pattern looks very modern and Scandinavian.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Action packed, great back story, acting was good. Loved the main character and the honorable men who stand for our country.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|The most charming (and a personal favorite) film adaptation of Austen's beloved novel. a lovely, sweet girl with an enchanting spirit, Emma sets out on a quest to play matchmaker for friends and family alike.  In this course,will Emma miss her own chance for true love,or does it prevail above all else?  A breezy, romantic comedy that  is frolicking good fun!!
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|There were definitely some scenes that could have been better. Good overall, good story, great actors. My husband and I both liked the movie overall.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|A flawless film- the best cinematic gem ever conceived.  This timeless Capra  classic seamlessly blends history, drama, comedy, romance, and faith in lovingly sewn stitches of fluidly interconnected scenes.  In addition, it examines the age-old question of human existence.  The remarkable, reassuring answer echoes as resoundingly as a choir of angels:  God does listen and care.  Each life has purpose and one  life can touch so many others in ways never imagined.  This gift must be embraced and celebrated as is this film each time it is viewed.  A must own!
B006OFN0SE|5.0|The screen play by gorgeous and smart Dustin Lance Black  really makes this film, with great lines like the one above uttered by Hoover's mother. She is letting her son know she would rather have him vanish than have to deal with the problem that dared not speak its name.  Amazingly Di Caprio does a great job with this complexity for a guy who drips a sort of ripe heterosexuality these days in real life; and Armee Hammer is really cute and perfect as Clyde, and what's more believable. But that line in the screenplay sort of says it all for Hoover's purpose- driven life., and reverberates for current events.
1416500286|5.0|Purchased at Wal-Mart.com<br /><br />My favorite Austen novel because it is so deliciously light-hearted and endearing as is heroine Emma Woodhouse.  Requited love and happy endings abound.  It makes me smile every time, I read it!  Perhaps the most popular storyline ever adapted along with Dicken's A Christmas Carol.
B0047SF41G|4.0|Great cast overall, good plot, nicely paced, great effects.  Minimal reliance on CGI and what there is is nicely integrated.  The plot suffers in that many of the characters are just cliches and the movie could actually have really used many of the cut scenes. It's unfortunate when they start cutting because they believe audiences can't watch a movie for more than 90 minutes, but this is one of those that really suffers for it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Purchased from Barnes& Noble<br /><br />A masterful adaptation of Austen's timeless tale that explores marriage, family, and one's role in Victorian society.  Flawless!
B004B63M1S|3.0|Enjoyable but not repeatable.  Incoherent and inconsistent in quality, pacing, dialog, cinematography, story. Not in the same league by any means as Desperado or From Dusk Til Dawn.  Too bad because the cast is very interesting and some of them stand out.  With some judicious editing it could have been another hit.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This is a great game but it was hard to control your character and I could not even attack well.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Buckle up for an irreverent, madcap romp through recent history. Remember It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World? Have fun.
B008N1V11U|5.0|It's great but there hands look weird. But if ignored it it's the best game ever. I used to have this on the iPad.
B000001ESJ|5.0|So, following the end of the first Rush Chapter the second one begins with what must surely rank as one of the finest albums of all time, even if it was produced in Wales...<br /><br />Now Rush had already raised the HEAVY METAL bar to new heights but here it was like a High Jumper competing in a Pole Vault competition. Not too shabby for a band featuring a Tractor parts salesman.<br /><br />Kicking off with the Mediaeval malarkey of the title track, we are truly in the presence of Genius. We are not worthy. Please resurrect it for your live shows.<br />Next we're off arm in arm through the mountain meadows with Samuel Taylor Coleridge to the legend of Xanadu. I'm so glad that Broon was there cracking the production whip because this is just perfection. You could finish the album there for me, OK it would be shorter even than Reign in Blood but it would be enough.<br /><br />Flip over your Licorice Pizza and get Closer to the Heart. Lots of people poo-pooh this for its concert ubiquity, but I love it, I'd love it more if it was played properly live.<br />Cinderella Man is a lively little number and Madrigal a nice thoughtful pause before the album finishes with the BLUDGEONING SCI-FI METAL MASTERPIECE that is Cygnus X-1 and what's this? To be continued... Interesting.<br /><br />All in all BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is super fun!! the entire family enjoys playing this game! and they keep it fresh with the new cities!!!
B00AQB2A3I|3.0|OK, that may be a bit harsh, but there's a great degree of fairness there too. He has quite a flat and whiny voice, luckily it isn't used too much.<br /><br />Now I'm not a great fan - make that not of all - of Porcupine Tree, but I do like his production work and intrigued by the track - Luminol - on a Prog Magazine Freebie CD I decided to invest in this, his latest oeuvre. So, what to make of it?<br /><br />Well, it's full on PROG! Hoorah!<br />But, that's not very progressive is it? Boo!<br /><br />It has real Mellotron! Hoorah!<br />But I'm sure some of it isn't. Boo!<br /><br />Renowned Bassist/Chapman Stick player Nick Beggs is on it. Hoorah!<br />But he was in Kajagoogoo. Boo!<br /><br />So I do like Luminol in all its trad Prog Trope messiness and I like Holy Drinker too. Hoorah!<br />But the title track is too much of an Anathema rip-off to me. Boo!<br /><br />So, do you Buy? It's up to you really. make up your own mind.
B00991TCOG|4.0|I loved the seemingly odd combination of classical violin paired with modern dubsteb.  She gives some great performances, I would recommend to others.  Her youtube videos are classy and fun, and professional produced.  She was also a contestant on America's Got Talent as well.  Definitely worth a view.
B000001ESF|5.0|So, Rush move on to album number four. And what do they give us?<br />Yes, they give us the PIN number for every geeky Rush nerd out there. You can now disarm the alarm in the house of any Rush fan, well the house of a Rush fans parent's, Rush fans being too geeknerd to be able to move out of the family basement.<br /><br />It was some time in the mid 70s that a mate of mine turned up at my house with a bag from the local record shop. \\"Clear your Death Deck\\" he said, you're going to like this. Well, I did, and here I still am Rushing.<br /><br />They cut to the chase with the 2112 itself. After the brilliance of the last track on CoS they decide to give us another side long opus. Can there be anybody out there who doesn't feel the hairs on the back of their neck rise at the opening whoosh? The only quibble I have is that nobody, but nobody learns guitar that quickly, come on...<br />A Passage to Bangkok proves that songs about Chuffy trains can never fail.<br />The Twilight Zone is a fitting tribute to the TV series.<br />Lessons is a bit lightweight.<br />Tears is the Rush ballad par excellence (Whaddya mean it's the only one?) and it's got Mellotron too.<br />Something for Nothing closes the album in ROCKTASTIC style, why this isn't still a staple of the Rush live show I knowETH not.<br /><br />Overall then a cautious recommendation to buy. Oh who am I kidding? BUY!!!! BUY!!!!! BUY!!!!!!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Tickled pink that I can find these Films when Disney puts them away in their Vault.  Its nice to know you can find them for me.
B00BF123WG|3.0|I was a little disappointed as I expected the story to be \\"Hollywoodized.\\" It ran more like a documentary style. It was pretty slow all throughout; there was no heart stopping action or sense of urgency. I was never on the edge of my seat.I actually fell asleep during the first run; I had to finish it the next afternoon. I expected much more out of this movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|I wanted a good dictionary for easy reference.  I keep it in a separate folder for all my personal, quick-use apps. It satisfies my look-up needs and is easy to use.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Nice way to pass the time. Just wish the help items were less expensive. All in all it runs well with little or no glitch
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son love's this game almost as much as the computer edition.  And now I get to use the computer!
B0098HGNGG|4.0|The meter itself is excellent. This meter would have gotten five stars, but for a few things:<br />1) The pouch should have a flap over the top<br />2) The meter cannot measure reflective light without the 5 degree attachment (minor for me, given I was going to buy it anyway for the 5 degree spot)<br />3) Dual complaint between this and the 5 degree attachment - the 5 degree reflective spot attachment comes in a little drawstring pouch. Sekonic should have provided a single pouch with this 478 (or with the 5 degree) that would allow storage of the dome and 5 degree attachment and meter. Why are there two incompatible carrying cases? Comes across as someone not thinking it through.<br /><br />Be aware that you must choose according to whether you currently (or will) use pocket wizards. The 478DR is for that. This 478D cannot be upgraded to pocket wizard capability later, so if you're going to use PW, get the 478DR instead. It's the only difference between the two (well, that and price).<br /><br />The menu, as someone else pointed out, is a little clunky. I got used to it within a day or so. I don't have a problem with the touchscreen, but then I don't have hands like a truckosaurus.<br /><br />Also, there is currently an issue with the Wacom driver and the driver for the Sekonic 478 that results in the 478 not being detected by the DTS software. The fix? You have to install everything (driver, DTS software etc., including the reboot) version 3.05 FROM THE CD ONLY (do not install the latest version, 3.06), plug in your light meter and turn it on, open DTS software. At this point it still will not be detected. Go to the update section inside the DTS software and update it to 3.06. DTS will auto close and reopen after this update and then your light meter will be detected. You can unplug the light meter and plug it back in again without issues, but if you close DTS you will have to uninstall 3.06, reinstall 3.05 from the CD, update from within DTS again to 3.06 for the auto close/reopen for it to see your meter. Sekonic are aware of this issue and are apparently working on it.<br /><br />Dome in gives me the ability to measure incident light from one source/angle, useful if I have multiple lights arrayed around a subject.<br />Dome out gives me incident light in 3D.<br /><br />Things I love about this meter:<br />-Accurate<br />-Able to calibrate my camera to my meter using my existing X-rite color checker passport, and have my dynamic range right there on the meter<br />-Can fine tune my own DR settings using the calibration profile<br />-ISO range exceeds my 5D Mk III on the low end and on the high end, with some future proofing there<br />-Memory functions<br />-Was only $70 more than the 378<br />-Memory functions are great, can see at a glance where all my measurements are<br />-Light<br />-Touch screen is responsive<br />-Able to angle dome/spot<br />-Sekonic have a TON of video tutorials, not just on their light meters but on using them in different scenarios, including an excellent vid for how to calibrate it<br /><br />I like that I can use AAA batteries in this.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Just what I wanted; lots of fun - thanks!  The dialogue is quick and intelligent - everything moves quickly.  It's the best show!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like this game! It's very addicting!the only thing I don't like is that it never lets me update! I've missed two updates because when I click on the update link it only takes me to the product details page and asks me if I want to download the game :/
B008Q09K2U|3.0|Unfortunately, I think Mr de Mille has exhausted the exploits of of John Corey & Kate Mayfield.  This book is simply not thrilling at all.  In fact in places the story line is down right silly.  He has managed to make John Corey into a caricature of himself these days.  de Mille seems more intent in having Corey voice his constant sarcasms and witticisms than keeping us in touch with the plot.  I used to find Corey amusing but too much is frankly too much.  Mr de Mille, I implore you, go back to those edge of the seat page turners that made you famous.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|It's kind of a hard book to read because of some of the language. But the ending was really good.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!;) I suggest u get this movie if u like action&adventure...this movie made me believe in da Greek gods even more than I already do!
B003WUYRGI|4.0|This is the best book for people who are not fluent in English.This is a great book to read and review. Arianna
B0084AXZK0|3.0|While it is in general an interesting story, the narrative gets long and windy at times.  There were many many things said that I kind of scratched my head about and just decided to continue on reading, not wanting to spend the time trying to figure out what the author was trying to say.  There were some things that weren't resolved - what did he threaten to expose about Alan Campbell if he did not help him? With that said, I really liked the ending.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|LOVE this game. It is very entertaining . I really like the speed challenge of the game. It doesn't get boring.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I totaly agree with u catgirl23; bananas should be americas favorite fruit... um I just noticed j was writing a review 4 minecraft is an awesome game
B000FGGEOK|5.0|I heard Anathema and just bought all their CD's. They have the gazer/indie flare and many songs are exquisitely layered both instrumentally and vocally. If superior alt/indie/gazer/stoner/nu-folk/semi-surreal music is to your liking then enjoy!

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Before going to see John Carter, I literally didn't know much about want it was about except that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote it and Jon Favreau was trying to make it for years. I even took my brother to the movie hoping that Favreau's involvement boded well for the movie. During the movie, I couldn't help wonder why there was not more fanfare or hype for this movie because I was enjoying this movie so much. This movie sets tone s being serious and campy at the same time. I know some people like how the movie jumps around at the beginning, but it's an intro to a character who has like 16 written about him. The movie is just fun and it is great science fiction, which I find funny that people had a hard time believing the plot. Emphasis: fiction. Overall, I loved this movie and I hope that I someday get to return to Barsoom.
1878424319|5.0|Great book with lots of ideas to consider and maybe change how you think about yourself & how you see others. I could tell that English may not be the author's first language, but it wasn't that distracting. Nice, well-intentioned book that helped me feel better :)
B008OJ291W|3.0|The fact that Lynne could go back and re-create these tunes to such a degree of detail is amazing. But...there's a certain compressed, poppy sound to the backing vocals on the original recordings that contributes hugely, yet mostly subconsciously, to the greatness of those original ELO recordings. That sound is not present here, and if you are at all familiar with the songs on this record, your brain will reject these recreations as false.<br /><br />An epic effort, but the time would have been better spent remixing the original tracks with today's EQ technology.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME. Very entertaining. My three year old loves it as well. Fun for all ages. Lots of fun.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This is one of the best Sci-Fiction movies. If you haven't seen it before, watch it now! Then watch the sequels in order.
B009TTGM3C|5.0|It's Grimm, but in a good way, nicely done, package arrived  securely and I'll not go into a dvd review, suffice to say, it's really Grimm ;-)<br />G2
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a great and simple calculator. I'd recommend this to allot of people. I use it all the time. One of the best things on this app is the backspace button. Allot of other apps like this don't have that. If you mess up a number just click the back button! This app is really cool.
B000I0QM0E|5.0|Excellent movie, some may have different opinions but I liked it a lot, enough to double dip and get this Blu-Ray version, packaged well and arrived quickly, I'll not go into a dvd review, enough of those out there, suffice to say it's great ;-)<br />G2
1416955070|3.0|I admit I was a bit leery about reading this book- I tend to be wary of YA fantasy in general- but I'd heard enough positive things about the Mortal Instruments series to give it a shot. (A huge risk since I always finish the series I begin, no matter how much I hate the books; hence why I forced myself to read the entire Twilight series.) Ultimately, in spite of the story's many flaws, I found it to be an enjoyable read.    It is not a perfect story. There are fantasy cliches aplenty; an \\"ordinary\\" teenage heroine who has a secret heritage/destiny she didn't know about before the book begins, a love triangle (blech), pure good vs. pure evil with a dark overlord, all-powerful magical items, etc. However, these cliches and stereotypes can still make for entertaining storytelling if done well, and I thought that Cassandra Clare made them work for the most part. It is also very evident that Clare was heavily influenced by other works, namely Harry Potter. For example, regular humans who can't use magic or see demons are called \\"mundanes\\". You can't tell me that wasn't pulled directly from the \\"muggles\\" of HP.    As I said, there are flaws aplenty. The story, for the most part, is predictable, with only one slightly surprising twist towards the end. The characterization is a bit choppy and the protagonist- Clary Frey- is definitely a bit of a Mary Sue/wish fulfillment character; I rolled my eyes when one of the other characters describes her as being beautiful but unaware of it. And I hate love triangles, especially when it's obvious which love interests the hero(ine) is going to pick, as it was in \\"City of Bones\\". Angst is a bit overdone. There are pages dedicated to infodumping and backstory, which is necessary at times but dragged and could have been explained much more elegantly.    In spite of these many flaws, \\"City of Bones\\" was still a fun read. The secret urban fantasy world of demons, vampires, werewolves and the like was fascinating and well thought out. It'sapparent Clare did her research in that regard, which I appreciated. There are definitely some interesting and memorable characters (hello Magnus Bane). And I did appreciate that, even though Clary is definitely Sueish in some ways, she didn't step in and become the best demonhunter in the world with zero training.     Basically, \\"City of Bones\\" wasn't earthshattering or particularly compelling, and brought nothing new to the fantasy genre, but it was worth a read. As I said in the title, I would file this one under \\"guilty pleasure reading\\". Even though I have a feeling that the \\"good\\" side is going to triumph, I'm at least interested to see what comes next and  can look forward to the next book, which is more than I could say about Twilight.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|this is a fun find. drunk one night i ordered it. was only disappointed that there werent more songs! i will look for more bargains
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Since I already have and LOVE One Republic's other two cds, I bought this one and I was not disappointed! The vocals and songs are again the distinct style of these artists. IF you are a fan you will NOT be disappointed!
B00008H2LB|5.0|great CD! one of Linkin Parks best! lots of great tracks this is a must buy for Linkin park fans!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like what I've seen so far, so I can't say much, but what I have seen, I like.
B0076DELIG|5.0|It is a nice blend of murder mystery, police procedural and family interactions.  I thought enjoyed the next installment in the Harry Bosch  series.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Great read. Loved the suspense. As always I love the characters Scarpetta, Benton, Lucy and Marino. We always enjoy reading that is written by Patricia Cornwell.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|A great read.  Reinforces your thoughts on taking words literally.  We all  love God gave this to us to live.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|Not for everyone due to blatant sexual subject matter.  However, John Hawkes, Helen Hunt, and the actress who plays Vera are all excellent.  I found myself rooting for John Hawkes to be successful and the funeral at the end a real tear jerker.  All in all very intense and with a lesser cast would not have been as effective
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a great way for minecrafters to be addictive and I love this game<br />Get it NOW it is so cool I am no jocing ..
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|The game is okay. But why did my battery die after playing for 15 minutes with the screen fully dimmed? I do like that it forces you to break (unless you want to pay real money for more lives) or you can get more lives by connecting on facebook. no thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a game I play all the merry night and all the merry day and I especially love playing subway surfers with Niall Horan
B00BF11STU|5.0|The last half-hour plays out like a very intense action thriller, and makes the movie worth watching just for the entertainment value. The characters throughout the movie are engaging, real, relatable, human. Jessica Chastain and Jason Clarke are formidable. I liked how the script did not shy away from less-than-flattering aspects of US policy. The movie deserves the awards it got.
B008TT7CXW|2.0|Couple of things I don't like about this product.<br />One, it is too thick for me. I had hoped it was perhaps just a tad thinner.<br />Second, after a few inserts, the SD cards started to a little loose. It does not fall out yet, but I can see it is only a matter of time before that will happen.<br />Third, the case that I got was a little warped (not completely flat). I understand at this price range, workmanship is not at its highest, but for a product that needs to be thin and precise, I was quite disappointed.<br />I think I'm going back to Walgreens to get those tiny ziplocks for pills. They work well for storing micro SD cards.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app will addict you and make you play all day. The only thing that is disappointing is that when you fall in the water, you die.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|Part Fugitive, part monster movie, part original Bill Bixby Hulk show, all Hulk!<br /><br />Though I still defend Ang Lee's Hulk, his movie was simply not what people were expecting. This vision of Hulk does a much better job. It partly erases the existence of the original Hulk movie, partly acknowledges it, mostly it says &#34;Let's just move on here.&#34;<br /><br />This is part of Marvel's Avengers cycle and deservedly so. It came out about a month after the original Ironman, and it was amazing to see references to S.H.I.E.L.D. and Stark Industries technology being used in the movie. The cameo at the end solidified it all: we were getting a Marvel movie universe. Epic!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game and so fun to play. The only problem when you do the upgrades you lose everything you have bought or earned throughout the game. Oh well. Gotta start over!!! Yeah
B00005O3VC|4.0|Who dosnt like this show. It is stupid and hilarious. It came fast and it is not scratched. I am good with it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|not the typical fantasy mind you. Just for those who fantasize about ditching it all and getting out in the wilderness.
1616550414|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. If you are a fan of this franchise at all, you should get this book. It is absolutely beautiful. It will adorn my coffee table for YEARS to come.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I you want hours of enjoyment and would like feeling fullfilled while creating an idea then Virtual City is the game for you. The tutorials could be a little easier to access but in general very entertaining! I highly recommend this game
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Thoroughly absorbing. Beautiful imagery.  Greatly enjoyed it!  Worth watching over and over again and a vital addition to any 3D collection.
1608871452|4.0|This book is great, especially the photos and interactive inclusions.  Would recommend for anyone who is an avid follower of the Supernatural series.
B003YV0A02|4.0|The original Die Hard is the best of the series. If you like Bang Bang shoot em ups, this is the best.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Loved the adventure.  There were some great surprise twists & enjoyable family humor.  No boredom & lots of characters to enjoy.<br />There is something different about this move from the Rings Trilogy that is hard to put your finger on, but still amazing scenery, great CG & good story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love to play, but I wish there were more coins to start off with. My girls and I all love to play.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is a great game. It's Fun and you will sit and play for hours before you even realize that the time has gone by.
0525958002|5.0|I loved this book. Loved it. So sweet. And very readable and entertaining. Yes, he glosses over a lot of things (that whole Warren thing), but what is there just made me smile as I was reading. And that does not happen to me very much. An absolute must for any John fan.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a great read. Really puts things into perspective, showing you that no matter what a person has been through there are always positives in the future. Happiness may not happen right off the bat but when it does it makes life much easier to deal with, especially when you have ones who love you and stand beside you. I would strongly recommend this book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games since Temple Run.  Its even better because it doesn't have the lean feature.  Highly recommend this game to anyone.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Love the story line and the puzzles. Everything flowed. Kinda wish there were a few more places to explore and &quot;save&quot;.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is not intended to be a specific review of the movie, or offer in-depth commentary on the content of the movie or the decisions made by Peter Jackson on what to include in the movie, although I will touch on that briefly.  Suffice it to say, any movie based off a book is much better enjoyed and appreciated to the fullest if the book is read first.  Some of the negative reviews I've heard about the movie are comments related to content in the movie not found in the book, and while that may be slightly true, it does not detract from the enjoyment of the movie.<br /><br />Blu Ray DVDs have come a long way from their start and I am happy to see that these DVDs have fast start to watch time (after short data load) and I can now pause the movie and can resume at the same exact point where I stopped previously.  This may have more to do with your DVD hardware capabilities (I use a PS3) but just the same a very nice feature.  The quality of the DVDs are excellent and the menus easy to navigate.  I have not yet explored the bonus disks and the 3D disks would not display on my TV.  I think its probably due to a software update needed for my TV which I have not taken the time to upgrade.  Not being a huge 3D fan anyway, it hasn't been a priority.  The sound quality is DTS and is very good.  And yes, I wish the DVD contained the extended version of the movie as I'm sure I will purchase that too when it comes out later.<br /><br />As a huge fan of the Tolkien books and the Jackson Lord of the Rings movies, I found the content of the story line to be accurate and true to the book with an occasional extravagance thrown in by Jackson.  It will be important to remember that the story still has two parts to go and the final judgment of the presentation should be reserved until the entire story is presented.  This is an incredible visual treat that brings the multi layer and rich content of Tolkien's book to life in a way that makes it truly believable and exciting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun! Fun for kids and adults too! I would recommend this game for just about all ages.
B000EWBNMS|4.0|Harry Houdini never met a spiritualist (medium rare or well done) whose chicanery he could not unmask. On the other hand, few of us had any trouble going along with Cary Grant as a Ghost and an Angel. Happily this is one of those entertainments where, for the sake of enjoying an otherwise well-constructed television drama, we can throw reality out the window and accept the unacceptable (by scientific standards).  My one regret is that in an act of cheap-skatery, the DVD was not given subtitles for the hearing impaired. A little public service shouldn't be beyond the capacity of this commercial enterprise.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great mix of puzzle to hidden object.<br />Very good graphics. Fun story with enough grab to keep you interested. Wish it was in movie format instead of comic book like.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Needed a better ending though!  The book was so suspenseful but the ending was disappointing, almost like the author just needed to finish it up quickly.
B007REV4T8|1.0|No real plot. Destroys Bond's Highlander home, new money penny. Erases the slate to start a young james bond cast and movies. That is the only reason for this movie is to get rid of any rizidual tradition of old james bond. It sucks.
B00275EHJG|5.0|My grandchildren and i love this one the best - very heartwarming touching movie - a must see for entire family!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Admittedly a fan since college, Austen is my favorite author, bar none. This is a more mature Austen, wistful and hopeful at the same time.  Anne Elliot is heartbreaking, and we cheer for her as she (finally) finds happiness, despite the interference of her family and friends.
6304711905|5.0|Tombstone is a classic western but it is better than than.  Right over wrong - good wins over evil.  My favorite character is Doc Holliday played by Val Kilmer.  Probably his best role ever (although I have not seen many of his other movies - a few tho).
B008476HBM|5.0|My absolute favorite of Austen's novels, and to my mind, the best book ever written.  Elizabeth Bennett is the most charming and delightful creature in literature, and you can't help but wish you had a friend like her.  Supposedly very much like Jane herself, it's astounding the author never married -- she is irresistible.  I take this book on every vacation and always find something new in it.  And I ALWAYS cry when when Jane tells Elizabeth that her fiance loves her and Elizabeth replies &#34;Of course he does!&#34;  (OK, it reminds me of the Jennifer Ehle scene in the Masterpiece version.)<br /><br />Everyone should read this book.
B004G600A4|5.0|My grandchildren LOVE this movie - it's in their top 5 &#34;most favorite of all the movies in the whole world&#34;.  We watch it often (and it's great for the entire family).
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Bought this in preparation for a long, boring trip up IH35.<br /><br />Money well spent .... and, I did not have to listen to bubblegum on Sirius.
B0027SRFUQ|5.0|Well written and interesting story that is timeless and  worth reading by persons of any religion.  Recommend highly to all groups.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent. Better than the popular Upstairs, Downstairs. They are so true to that period of history. Can't wait for Season3.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good product, but have only had since 4/1/13 but nice game for kids and pre teens. Nice to take care of and learn responsiblity
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My kid loves the show and this toy he's always taking over my mind with the Sonic Screwdriver. Parents beware of this toy the chilren could take over. Having alot of fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addictive, drives me crazy, but I love playing the game ... the kids love the game, too ... lots of fun for the whole family...
B005LAII4E|2.0|I liked the first one but this one was bad, I like a lot of moives that people say are bad but for this one is a wast of time to see,
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I picked up this book after seeing the movie, Lincoln, wanting to learn more about the politics of the end of the Civil War. I got much, much more than I bargained for. This is a gripping, clear and loving retelling of most of Lincoln's life. I especially loved how smoothly the author transitioned between narrative and quotes from contemporary sources. I recommend this book very highly!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It works does all the basic functions even some I don't use<br /> On the Kindle it's like the desk models of old, big and easy on the eyes
B0054R6BFM|5.0|If I were able to give this book 10 stars I would! It really makes you think about the way your life is intertwined with everyone else. Always keep in mind the way you treat other people, you never know what somebody else is going through.
B005EVVESM|4.0|Has some good songs and I can listen to the whole album all the way through without wanting to skip a song. But nothing really jumps that much out at you. Worth buying if you like Maroon 5.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|All episodes are so good but 'Landlord' makes me laugh harder every time I watch it. The script is amazing and the physical comedy is off the charts!
1595827684|5.0|I love this book! Seeing the amount of thought that went into the characters and what each species all most looked like is great. The book is bound well and I'm not worried about messing up the spine as I look through it. This is just a really great book to have for any Mass Effect fan.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|What a wonderful surprise of an album after so many years. There's something for everyone here, from rockers like the title track, to more introspective songs like &#34;Where Are We Now?&#34;
1616550414|5.0|You can tell this was only recently planned out. 'Skyward Sword' has the biggest section with a lot of sketches for the characters. It has a timeline part, but I've never really cared to much about the continuity of the series, just the quality of the games, so I haven't looked to hard at those pages.<br /><br />The book itself if bound very well, with the gold writing standing out beautifully against the dark green. And it has a cute manga at the end for 'Skyward Sword'.<br /><br />Overall, if you like The Legend of Zelda and enjoy seeing how the characters were worked out, you should pick this up :)
B00BHMF578|4.0|Really good movie. Ben was a bit stoic and flat, but I guess that was the character. It was tense, suspenseful and the ending was satisfying.
B005QI4TP8|2.0|I liked their first album 'Lungs' so much that I couldn't wait for this one. I really don't like any of the songs. The whole album has a different feel than 'Lungs' and I don't mind that they tried something different for this one, just wasn't meant for me.
B005LAII80|5.0|Yes, indeed. This is one that has been around since the start of all things Star Wars. Starting off as a one-off comic character, he quickly demanded his own title. Dredd has amazing 3D, gratuitous violence, frenetic action sequencing, superb editing and fairly believable acting. This is the guy that thanks to twenty years ago might only be remembered for the cheesy one-liner &#34;I AM THE LAW!&#34;. This film surpasses the Stalone version and does not look behind.<br /><br />For those who did not know, Judge Dredd is a mean streak gone mental, the most infamous and dangerous of a super police force in Mega City One. Everything you expect from a movie from such a simplistic plot point ensues at break neck speed. Criminal mastermind stages a district take down on the same day Dredd has to evaluate a rookie's front line performance.<br /><br />And kudos to Kurt Urban, who has played in so many movies and played his part so well, most people might not realize this is the same bad arse that was in The Two Towers, Chronicles of Riddick, and his pitch-perfect part as Bones in the Star Trek revamp series. He is proving to be a powerhouse, and this film needed that kind of weight to the performance. The helmet does not come off. Not even for a second. And you still see a great job on screen.<br /><br />The slight downfalls include one too many slo-mo scenes (even if they were a plot device) and the fact that the film has enough grit to encompass every Western that Clint Eastwood ever did. These trifles are easy to ignore so long as you realize this is a 'comic book film' and 100% true to canon. With all its kind rearing its head at Hollywood, Dredd reminds us that not all comics have spandex-clad super-powered characters.<br /><br />Some just barrel their way past the critics and naysayers and are found in a violent part of this fan's heart. Apparently, happiness is indeed a warm Lawgiver... er, gun.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another success by John Grisham.  Very interesting story that once you start you have a hard time putting the book down.
B00APKIN1I|3.0|It's like the Foo Fighters houseband with different lead singers. No one spectacular on vocals unless you like Stevie Nicks (whom I hate)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great app.<br />I suggest that you get it.It is hard to get to the higher levels and go to different cities. If you do not like temple run Don`t get this app. Temple run is almost exactly like it.The cop in the bunny suit chasing you in the game is cheesy.You always get caught by the cop. This is a game that never ends. But I love the app. I suggest not getting the game if you don`t like spending time being on the menu instead playing the game. This app also goes  right to face book
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is an awesome movie. If you are an Austin fan you must own this movie, it is the best version available of Pride and Prejudice.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|awesome series and great action, acting, etc.  wish there were more to come like it.<br />losing sleep staying up watching.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great romance novel. The characters are so true to life and the picture of perfection. It's one of those books that is difficult to put down and it is so hot!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun!!! This app will keep me occupied for days if there was no school. There is only 1 problem, I got it on my kindle and the game will not let me update to the next setting, SO ANNOYING!!!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I was lucky enough to pre-order this for ~$60 but was unable to actually open it up for a while. After reading reviews by other people on the quality of this guy I was a bit worried! Though, after finally opening mine up and setting him on my shelf I can honestly say that I couldn't be happier! I don't know what these other people are talking about when it comes to 'poor quality'... he is fine! The detail is great which makes this a genuine creepy fixture to my movie shelf. The blu-rays are also awesome and I haven't had any problems with any of them. Overall, this was a sick purchase that I highly recommend to any Walking Dead Fan :D
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|You Should play this game it's the best game ever since I played it I thought it was going to be boring but it's not
B0083SBMBM|3.0|At the height of popularity, superhero movies offer something more than just entertainment. In a world where morals are rare and heroes are scarce, movies such as The Avengers are viewed as some of the best loved films of all time. The Avengers is a combination of the comic book heroes \\"Thor,\\" \\"Captain America,\\" \\"The Hulk,\\" and \\"Iron Man.\\" This wildly successful film is more than just entertainment. The Avengers brings people together to watch their favorite superhero, within one movie everyone can agree on. People of all ages have come to enjoy this film.<br />The story of The Avengers starts out fast and continues to captivate the audience throughout the film.  The plot can become dense and hard to follow at times, but the action packed scenes keep the viewer engaged. The Avengers are brought together after the examination of the \\"blue cube\\" when an evil god named Loki emerges and begins a world of trouble. The S.H.E.L.D. agents must bring together their heroes. Tony Stark \\"Iron Man,\\" Dr. Bruce Banner \\"The Hulk,\\" and Steve Rogers \\"Captain America,\\" these men are later joined by \\"Thor\\" a god of a different universe. These superheroes must learn how to work together and save the world.<br />The Avengers, like any true superhero movie has many action packed scenes. Because of the high action and great special effects The Avengers could be considered elite in its category of \\"superhero movies.\\" Aside from the action, this movie also offers some \\"laugh out loud\\" humorous moments, and witty comebacks between the superheroes. Each hero has a super-sized ego, to go along with their super-sized issues. For example, Captain America proves countlessly that he is not from this age, and the hulk must keep cool in order to contain the \\"green monster,\\" and Iron Man's witty comebacks and sarcastic remarks make every situation light hearted.<br />Although, The Avengers is fun to watch, I found myself confused more than once. It's evident during the film, if one has not seen all the superhero movies, The Avengers may not be for you. Bits and pieces from the other movies are stashed in The Avengers, if the viewer hasn't seen all the rest of the movies confusion is bound to be lingering.  Ultimately, The Avengers is one film that has a puzzling start but by the end of the film it seems to explain itself.<br />Overall, The Avengers is a fast paced action packed movie that nearly everyone will enjoy. The idea of taking several well-loved films and combining them into one brilliant movie is risky but in this case the risk paid off and The Avengers is worth adding to your superhero collection.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|On amazon.com it said if you won a game on brutal for all disease types you get necroa disease free I am working on it.  Wonderful game highly recommended by me and at least 500 other people who wrote reveiws.

B003ODIZL6|1.0|Because of the other words from every page.  Liking the words from the title.  Parents told me to not only
B006LSZECO|3.0|This chick is insane.  It's like a modern day Fatal Attraction but not impulsive.  It's calculated and disturbing.  Strange ending.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love this game! Very entertaining. Great effects and music. This game doesn't require spending any money and it is fun to play.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|my daughter listens to this CD in her room all the time.  She loves everything about Taylor Swift.  There are some great songs and lyrics on this CD
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|See review #1.  Too bad it has to end, someday!  Perhaps, the children can take over when Walt is finally brought down.  Will he be brought down?
B000002J0B|5.0|It took me years of listening to Zeppelin to appreciate that Houses of the Holy represents Zeppelin at their best. Although it's very difficult if not impossible to rank their albums from best to worst, this underrated album clearly stands out to me as not only the band's reinvention of themselves (a process that all great bands must pursue), but their crowning masterpiece. The album begins with one of their best songs, the Song Remains the Same, an epic gem that showcases page's virtuoso on guitar, as Plant's vocals feather in and out. The album continues with the emotional and beautiful Rain Song, the incredible Over the Hills and Far away, and concludes side one with the playful yet rhythmically complicated the Crunge, which is also their tribute to James Brown. Side two kicks off with Dancing Days, a unique, psychedelic staple of Zeppelin concerts. D'yer Mak'er follows, which may be one of Zeppelin's most positive, fun songs, with a reggae riff that would set any Rastafarian's head bogging. No quarter is a brooding masterpiece that must be taken in slowly and savored little by little. Finally, the album concludes with the ocean, an excellent piece that resembles earlier Zeppelin songs, as if illustrating that they haven't strayed too far and have retained their core identity as a band. Any Zeppelin fan who loves their more accessible albums like Led Zep IV, owes it to themselves to give this diamond the chance it deserves and to discover for themselves why it truly is one of the best albums ever made.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|The storyline is incredibly unusual, the acting superb with great good-guys, great bad guys, and wonderfully twisted plots that really question, do you really know people you know?
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I have purchased all of the series to date...this evaluation is a long time being done after the purchase.  Can hardly wait for the next edition to be done on DVD after the season's finish.
1400067820|5.0|I have reviewed a lot of books through the Amazon Vine program (thanks Amazon!) and it has never taken me so long to finish a book and write a review as it has for Nassim Nicholas Taleb's [[ASIN:1400067820 Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder]].  The reason is simply because the ideas in this book are important, fascinating, and frequently difficult.  I would often read a few pages and then need to spend hours thinking about what I had read before picking up the book again.<br /><br />Readers familiar with Taleb's [[ASIN:081297381X The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: \\"On Robustness and Fragility\\"]] will find similarly interesting ideas in this book.  If you haven't read The Black Swan, please consider starting with it before tackling Antifragile.  Both books are provocative and show that humans are very bad at risk analysis and anticipating the likelihood of improbable events - and that planning for such events is wasted effort.  Antifragile makes the further point that such events can have positive results, that is that systems can gain from disorder.<br /><br />This brief summary does not do justice to Taleb's iconoclastic books but will, I hope, encourage you to make the effort to read this fascinating and rewarding book.  The Chapter and Section titles convey something of the spirit of this book with examples like:  Never Marry the Rock Star, The Inverse Turkey Problem, What Does Not Kill Me Kills Others, and How to Argue in an Emergency Room.  Fans of \\"Fat Tony\\" will not be disappointed and readers can also enjoy Taleb's discussion of such topics as the paleo diet, veganism, exercise, and many other topics.
0790729369|4.0|This is one of Clint Eastwood's best performances.  A real tearjerker love story if I've ever seen one.  Didn't want it to end as it did.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I read this book many, many years ago and although I knew the story it was wonderful reading it again. I would definitely recommend this to readers of well written literature.
B000002U6E|4.0|This CD captures my varied interests in sounds...gregarian chants to Asian soloist...very pulsating and captivating ... it's very uplifting really.
0762777931|5.0|A lot of people have said the same thing for years, but not nearly as well as Kris Carr. We've all read the material in text books, been lectured to by boring profs, etc. Kris Carr does a wonderful job of making you laugh out loud! Also and I think another reviewer said this, it really helps to have so many great authorities in one book. I highly recommend the book.
B00003XB8K|4.0|This CD like some of the other three I own have duplications in music tracks.  I'm a great fan of the pulsating and captivating sounds on these CDs.

B0015DYIH2|3.0|I just like the movie better.  I need visual and the 2 actors who played Edward and Bella were perfedt.
1451673442|5.0|If you read and seen the Secret, you can easily follow this book. but even if you haven't, it gives you a day to day process, so you do a little everyday, and it really helps you see the world around you in a brighter light. It is an easy read, the steps are easy. I read it every night before I go to sleep and that's all it takes. I recommend the book to anyone that wants to live not just look at the bright side.
B0034DGPEU|1.0|What a well written story.  It made you feel you were actually there. I hope others enjoyed it as y

B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this movie. I will say that it's about time they made it. I've been waiting for this since the Lord of the Rings finished. The 3D is terrific as well, although the scenes shown in the 3D menu looks very weird. Fortunately, this doesn't stop you from reading the menu, and the movie itself plays perfectly.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have never read more then 200 pages in a book because I couldn't get in to it. This book was so interesting that I read the whole thing and I am planning on reading the others. I would recommend this book to people 14 years & older to read it. If u r younger then 14 I recommend waiting to read this series because of the intercourse. Thank you and I hope you enjoy the book, I kno I did.

B008476HBM|3.0|I am an old man. Finally got around to reading this book just because I had heard of it all my life.  It was ok...just not an old man's book as far as I could see.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|While this book was not as good as McEwan's Attonement, I nevertheless found it intriguing.  I especially like the last fourth of the book with its surprise twist and I went back to read the entire novel and realized all the plot's foreshadowing.

B008JFLWLE|4.0|Great app and it's very easy for us to left hand girls<br /> to use! We do feel like the answer comes up very quickly. If I could change one thing it would contain a submit button so you interview before the answer comes up. Still great!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The wonderful story of how a young hot girl can completely mess up a well established Dominants fun. It sets itslef up to be all about Dominant/submissive lifestyle and ends up being your run of the mill love story with a little spanking. Not a bad read but was expecting a little more kink.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had DVR issues so I missed too many episodes of this season. I could not wait for re-runs...so thank goodness for streaming video! I got caught up and back on track.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Shows the patient, dramatic and relentless chase, to hunt down OBL.  A real powerful movie for our generation to remember.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Of course I love this movie! I love Will Smith. It is another fun movie in the MIB series. These movies make me chuckle...they are fun. Not to be taken seriously...great for a bit of levity.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I found this book very interesting and a good way of being able to take your mind off everything in someone's life.
B000F8O35U|1.0|I feel like for what I paid and for it being new it shouldn't be skipping and pausing throughout the whole movie. I had to buy another one that actually plays with no problems, this was just a waste of money.
B00B2166BS|4.0|The pogo adapter was long waited for by many Nexus 10 owners, myself included. I wanted this adapter because I have a laptop computer that I broke the power plug off the motherboard by not being careful with the cables while the laptop was charging. With the pogo adapter, when something tugs on the cable too hard, the magnets release and the adapter falls off. No worries!<br /><br />I would have given 5 stars but the magnets, although very good, are not excellent. The cable will fall out if you try to pass the tablet to someone else to view something of if you just aren't being careful enough while you move.<br /><br />That being said, I do recommend the Nexus 10 Pogo Cable charging adapter.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Amazing I love the love story between Lena and alex :) its so romantic and intense they do anything for each other
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is like so fun I like it then  I get bored of it tho. You should so get it...but one time I was at like 5,000 coins and it totally stopped I w<br />as like o.m.gurd
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is a game that has stolen way too much of my time.  I love it.  From playing an intergalactic trader to a nefarious pirate I recommend to anyone..
B007L6VR12|5.0|As someone who grew up in the 60's, this film had a lot of memories for me, from the short dress with knee socks to the yellow suitcase, to the &#34;orchestra for children&#34; record.  The kids are charming and the entire story is a quirky Wes Anderson masterpiece!<br /><br />The vendor allowed DVDs to be combined for free shipping, and it arrived in three days.  Overall an awesome transaction and I'm a happy customer!
B00C0OOV5O|5.0|One of the best shows on TV these days worth watching! Filled with drama and suspense which keeps you wishing for the next episode/season to hurry along! Love the cast and writer of the show!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I got the UK version which isn't as heavily edited as the PBS version.  There's a little more footage of Lady Mary's wedding which I can't understand why after waiting all these years, any of the long awaited event would be  cut.
0316017930|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It makes you think.  Gladwell does a very good job telling stories that make his hypothesis come to light.  Well worth the $10 and a quick read.
B0099114WO|5.0|I laughed so hard I cried, there were so many spot on moments in this film. Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones - doesn't get better than this!<br /><br />The vendor allowed DVDs to be combined for free shipping, and it arrived in three days. Overall an awesome transaction and I'm a happy customer!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is legendary truly keeps you on the edge of your seat. A mix of events that can occur if this world isn't fixed.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I had not read the book, but I was looking forward to this movie.  The characters seemed very real, not the typical stereotypes often in &#34;teen&#34; movies.  The music is great, and the clothes and props brought back memories of my youth.  My college kids and I both loved it.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like that the rewards come fast so it seems like you are making headway right away. Very easy to play.
0399157565|5.0|The book's price was more than fair, it arrrived early and in great shape. I love the aurthour and have read every one of his books. I hope he writes a hundred more.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|My daughter loves this movie! She watches it allot, she loved watching it on T.V and she loves it more on DVD it has allot of scenes not showed when it is played on T.V
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Anna Torv & John Noble are amazing.  All the characters have their own distinct personalities and the storylines are incredible
B005LAIIGC|5.0|The next great family movie. Pace is perfect for our four year old, also enjoyable for parents! Good way to talk about good and bad and right and wrong with your children.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is normally not my type of music. There has been so much hype about her, that I had to at least listen to one of her albums. I was impressed.
1423140605|5.0|It came on time for only $11 and my 3 boys LOVE this series.  It wasn't available at the local library, because it was in such high demand.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Outstanding!!<br />  I have all of Susans' music and so far this is the greatest. She puts so much into a song that males it exclusively her music. Good music lovers take note.<br />  Bob M.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I do not think fans [like me] will be disappointed.<br />Good links to prior stories, but enough meat for the first time Bosch reader
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|when i went to see this movie with my 4 year-old-son, i laughed so much at a movie theater!<br />i haven't been able to see adult comedy in a theatre for a while because of my son but this really did it for me<br /><br />it will be funny for adult looking back what we had when we were young, and for kids, this is just soooo cool!<br />and i like the japanese cartoon like characters too. those &#34;kawaii&#34; characters are just adorable
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I enjoy this book because like other of King's which I've read, I feel like he's speaking to me or at least telling me a really intriguing long anecdote or story. King just kind of lulls you and lures you in. Page turner...really!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|i must say, i underestimated this movie<br />easter bunny, tooth fairy, santa clause, sandman and jack frost.... get together and fight for children??<br />omg, i thought this was gonna be bad. buy my 4 year-old-son was really interested in it, and i learned that this was made by the creater of how to train your dragon movie... which i love<br /><br />let me tell you. this is one of the most profound movie i ever seen in my life<br />it was funny yet touching.<br />even the 4 year-old can understand.  i will be looking forward to seeing a sequel<br /><br />i didn't know that this was based on a children's book, so i'm thinking about purchasing the book for my son as well
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a Great way to stay in contact with family and friends! It is very easy to use also.
075669812X|5.0|just to get this elemental lloyd ninja worths the price of the book!<br />on ebay, people are selling this elemental ninja llloyd for about $20!!<br /><br />the book is very well organized and my 4 year-old-son loves the big pictures of the characters.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is simple to use.  it is so nice to be able to navigate my Bible so easily.  I can easily change the version I am reading, highlight, and make public or private notes.  I can read downloaded versions of the Bible even when I do not have access to wifi.  There are many reading plan options, and optional devotional.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|i wanted to show this to my 4 year-old-son<br />he loved it! he's so obssessed with CG animation so i was worried<br />but he loved it and we watched it over and over again
B0084U0IEG|3.0|This was selected by my book club. It was pretty dull, but the surprise ending was fun if you make it that far.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|My only hope is that sometime in the future this series will be picked up again by BBC to continue the story of Dorcas and her new love.
B00BF123WG|4.0|i really liked it , but I did like Argo better.  I would recommend it to others.  It is a movie we should all see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games I have played yet! Everything is good, the graphics, gameplay and the characters. Ithink everyone could play it.
0345525558|4.0|It was a totally different book for me but it was still enjoyable. You need to read this whole book.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|This movie was not as good as I had expected, I mean the story and acting were decent but the first hour and a half all this movie is, is just watching people get tortured and interrogated to the point where it becomes very uninteresting and boring. I understand that people were interrogated, I understand people were tortured but I don't need a movie to waste an hour and a half showing me that. The next hour of the film was pretty much talking in an office, again it was just to long and you lost interest by the end of the movie. The half an hour spent going after bin laden was the only part of the movie that didn't drag and was enjoyable to watch. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, I'm giving it a low rating because I do not feel the length of the film was justified, if it were an hour and a half I would have rated it probably a 4 star, but 3 hours was excessive considering the content
0151008116|4.0|DIFFERENT!!  It was fast paced but not what I would read again. I did not go to see the movie.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|More chapters or levels needed love the game but went to fast.  I loved how tough it was to find some of the items. Great job on that.
B00746O3X8|5.0|Used it while on vacation in Arizona. It reduced the pain in my wrist and elbow from carrying my t3i and 100-400 lens and eliminated the neck pain. The 2nd camera holster is a little cumbersome when hiking, but since I was able to carry my binocs and camera I love the product.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|3D Mahjong is the only way to go! Unlike original Mahjong you can actually finish a game and feel relaxed! I highly recommend!
0547848412|4.0|It's a slow beginning but don't give up.....it gets better. I haven't seen the movie yet but hope it does without the very realistic details of the way the animals meet their demise.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|It was an easy read, but not a very exciting or stimulating one.<br />A lot of hard-working the reader which felt patronizing and annoying.
0517053616|5.0|A quite large, well enough done leather copy of the Bard's works.  It's not quite up to the standards of the Franklin or Easton presses, so if you want a wedding gift for a Theater major, spring for a bit more if you're out of grad school.  It is a solid, heavy, and august copy of Shakespeare however, and that is worth having on the shelf of anyone with respect for literature and time on his or her hands.<br /><br />It's a great way to pass time if you are between jobs true enough, but otherwise I doubt I'll ever have the chance to read more than a few old friends like Macbeth, a Midsummer's Night, or Julius Caesar.  Perhaps I'll peruse it for a few moments to recall Shylock's chagrin, Iago's rage, or Hamlet's musing, but most likely it will have to wait long years on my bookcase as I slave for my own living.  Perhaps it will inspire me to leave the Oregon coast some summer vacation for an inland festival, or catch a performance on a campus back east when my daughter goes off to college, and if so, it was worth the purchase.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I chose a 5 because it is a great bridge between the Twilight movies and True Blood, both of which I enjoy immensely. If you are into Vampires that are mainstream then this is a good watch.  You have the tortured sexy vampires wrestling with their good and bad natures and in a love triangle with a human. Season two further develops the relationships between the  two vampire brothers and their mutual love interest.  I found this very enjoyable and watched it twice.  I can't wait for season four to be released.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is awesome, must read the whole series it pulls you in and I can't wait to get to next page. Even my husband who doesn't read much is enjoying it. Love it!!!!
B0063GORYU|3.0|someone added this to my device so I haven't tried it out. if it is a solitaire game, I will enjoy it.
0439023521|5.0|Was very good and kept attn the entire time.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good read.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I watch this TV show all season and knew what I was buying.  I am happy to be able to see the programs over and over with this DVD
B0064QNS62|4.0|Still getting the hang of it.  Reminds me of Mario Brothers.  Hate the dang fire shooter, keep dying guess I'll have to practices more.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Great album. My son watches Austin and Ally all the time. Lovely upbeat music for youngsters and adults alike. Would definitely recommend this CD.
0545265355|5.0|Fun, easy to read.  Good story line and well written.  Went and looked for more books by Suzanne Collins.....they were good too!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It is a great movie!!  It has great characters and it is action packed.  I would definitely watch this movie again!!
B003UBTX7C|4.0|It was interresting and kept you in suspence, but not one of Balldacci's best.  Still, very good reading, with a different amgel..
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Good movie, very happy to be able to add this to my collection.  No problems with the actual product working.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Re-reading for the second time. It's one of the best books I've read in a decade. Garth Stein is brilliant.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this as a replacement for my lost cable.  No problems with compatability.  Works great and well pleased with it.
0738212415|5.0|This book is GREAT!! It has enhanced my ability to draw tremendously in my own opinion. It really does give you step by step visuals and the author explains things very well.  Great book!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Sorta seems irrelevant to review a movie.  You've probably already seen this movie and liked it or you would'nt be buying it.  It plays fine, no problems with the product itself.  Still getting used to Daniel Craig, but he's doing a good job so far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun u should get this game because a lot of people like it and it's way better than temple run and all that stuff but it's my opinion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I got this app for my Fire.  I already had it on my smart phone and the ability to have all my bookmards on both devices by being logged in is great.  I love all the available versions it has.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|It's a very good game i like how they added the multiplayer and I think they should have had it in the first one.  Overall it's a good game
B004EPYZV2|4.0|I'm not a professional movie critic, but I obviously enjoyed the movie or I wouldn't have ordered it.  More than likely you wouldn't be ordering it unless you liked it or similar movies.  I've had no problems with the product itself.

B003HARV4S|5.0|I have a lot of favorites and this one has to be one of them.  A magical mystery?  I don't really know how to describe it other than good.  No product issues.
B002JODV3S|5.0|This live show was incredibly planned, played and edited. I had recently seen Vai live and was not disappointed. Where the Wild Things Are show the best of Vai and should not be missed
B002ZG981E|5.0|I'm not a professional movie critic, but I obviously enjoyed the movie.  Have to pay close attention or watch it a couple of times, but worth it.  I've had no problems with the product itself.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I'm not a professional movie critic, but I enjoyed the movie.  Still not sure I got it all.  Definitely not your Disney Snow White by any means.  I've had no problems with the product itself.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Sorta seems irrelevant to review a movie.  You've probably already seen this movie and liked it or you would'nt be buying it.  It plays fine, no problems with the product itself.  I love these movies.
B0053O89YM|4.0|I'm not a professional critic, but I enjoyed it.  More than likely you wouldn't be ordering it unless you were a fan of the series.  I've had no problems with the product itself.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I'm more than a little disappointed in how this movie failed to follow the book more closely from getting things outright wrong to skipping what I felt was important information.  I've had no problems with the product itself.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This is a fictional movie of a very real and very sad figment of our society.  Liam Neeson was great in this movie.  If you get a chance, help fight trafficing in persons and the trade it supports!!!
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|I'm not a professional movie critic, but I obviously enjoyed the movie or I wouldn't have ordered it.  I'm wondering if this will be the last in the series of Underworld.  More than likely you wouldn't be ordering it unless you liked it or similar movies.  I've had no problems with the product itself.
B009AMANH4|4.0|Sorta seems irrelevant to review a movie.  You've probably already seen this movie and liked it or you would'nt be buying it.  It plays fine, no problems with the product itself.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|I think I liked the alternate ending better than the theatrical ending.  I want a sequel.  No product issues or malfunctions.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|Cute movie for my kids.  I'll admit I watched it too and enjoyed it.  No problems or issues with the product.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I was a wondering how this movie would fit in the big picture.  I've never been a hardcore comic follower, but I wasn't disappointed in how this movie was done.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|First time I watched this movie I didn't realize where this movie was going until the very end.  Good movie.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I really do hope this will be the beginning of a long running movie series.  RD Jr. did a really good job.  Product worked flawlessly.
B000L212HC|4.0|Not magical, but a very nicely done movie.  Nice twist, but some may see it coming. No problems with product.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Robert Downey Jr did a very good job in this sequel.  You will not be disappointed.  No issues with the product itself.
B007MDB71O|4.0|I remember this movie getting less than stellar reviews.  However, maybe I'm just a sci-fi junkie, but I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I really hope there is some kind of follow-up.  I've had no problems with the product itself.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I'm not a professional movie critic, but I obviously enjoyed the movie or I wouldn't have ordered it.  I'm anxiously awaiting the sequel.  I've had no problems with the product itself.
B004Y5AV4M|4.0|Always like that story.  Richard Armitage is the best reader you have.  Wish he would do all your books.  Men read women parts much better that women read male parts.
B001MM28JG|4.0|I've been watching this movie now and then since it was released in 1999. It's always cracked me up. It's a good flick with good actors/actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Tim Allen, Severus Snape...). One does not need to be a fan of Star Trek or anything like that to understand the comedy.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|If you like the movies this is a good download. Easy to learn and fun to play. Worth at least trying!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a really good and fun game which get really addictive I wonder we're Jake and tricky will go next ( they should come to Britain )
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game. It's like temple run but better. I haven't played temple run since I bought the game. You will love the game. It also also helps reflects. Bye.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I haven't watched a single episode of Twin Peaks, but after reading this book I kinda wished that I had. What a truly great story and very well told. Kept me guessing to the very end.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|I really like this author and her style of writing is so genuine, it will make you laugh out loud or cry. If you enjoyed this book then try Left Neglected.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|IT IS SO COOL I LOVE IT AND I CANT WHAT TO GET BACK ON IT THATS HOW COOL IT IS!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I'm just getting used to the Blu Ray discs but these are awesome. So I'm definitely looking at more purchases like this.
0385528752|5.0|This book covers making changes even when you have little, if any, control. As with the previous book they provide a mnemonic which keys you back into their writing. It will not be of much use if you have not read the book. It ties into several other books I have read recently (like Fast Thinking, Slow Thinking).
B0060AY6FO|3.0|This is a fun book for fans of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  Since Austen has done all the work creating the characters we all love, James only has to weave a credible mystery.  I certainly enjoyed the book.
144233620X|5.0|Received it quickly and worked well.  What more can I say.  I feel like I am writing an essay for school requiring so many words
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I was so excited to watch the third season, but the DVD is not really HD picture, its dark and not clear as the first and second season. other than this the delivery was great as usual. the package was good, the DVD is working good.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|The tide of change is certainly at its peak right now concerning equal rights.  This book personalizes the issue and shows that gay couples are no different than any couple that is committed to one another and everyone has their own agenda when broaching the topic.  Jodi Picoult is an excellent writer.
B005GY0Y8S|2.0|Finally finished it! Author is very descriptive but not enough when it came to her characters. I couldn't bring myself to care for Magee. The only one I had empathy for was the little girl and that's just sad. Magee is so wimpy and naive! Who in their right mind goes out at 3AM to see about a crying dog in the big city? I'd call the cops. Who would trust people they've never met and are paying to retrieve a never before seen/heard of long lost niece, sleep with one of them all while in a foreign country? And all the French - was it really necessary? I had to make up my own pronunciation for some stuff and that killed the flow of reading. She translated most of it anyway. Why not have me imagine the French accent as I read the English translation sans French phrasing? Like Magee. And who is Madame Zouk working for telling Gerard where to find Magee?<br />And yes. There was a death in France but it wasn't murder, it was an accident. Though if you want to stretch it, it was due to neglect and that could be considered murder? The murders dealt with in this book happen in Atlanta.<br />There are so many things. Read at your own risk. I won't be reading the rest of the Mysteries.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great time killer that also helps mental sharpness. At first, it seems so simple, but the complexity increases quickly. Very fun.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|A Christmas gift for our son from his wish list,  He enjoyed this and was very happy to add it to his collection.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This carefully crafted story is filled with fantastic twists and turns! There's so much to reflect upon, and so many interesting characters in this well-written series.  Even the ending is satisfying while at the same time leaving you still craving more.  I hope to read more of the Silo Saga soon!!
B0011UF792|5.0|Christmas gift for our son who had this one his wish list.  He was happy to add this to his collection.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|At first we purchased  the Lion Kings read-alone storybook CD, my kids really enjoy it.  So we had to purchase the movie, it's a classic. We also have seen the play.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for our son from his wish list.  He enjoyed it very much and was happy to get it.
B0018PJEYY|5.0|This is one of a series of re-released classic albums by the Moody Blues. Like the others in the series, this CD contains a great booklet with photos of the band members and the original album cover artwork. It also contains great liner notes with information about the band and the recording sessions for the songs on this album. All of the tracks from the original (vinyl) release are included as well as 6 bonus track. Five of these are alternate versions and one is a song that was not included on the original release because it was unfinished. The alternate version of the title track, Question, is the one that I remember being released as a single. If you like the Moody Blues, then you will want this reissue for your CD collection.
B005HSL626|5.0|New game to add to my Kindle and I enjoy planning this game.  My niece told me about this game.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|a fun easy read that mixes the romanticism of history with the wonder of the modern. a perfect read for a tablet on a plane ride to an old city ...
B003L77G6A|5.0|Then ext in the series of The Big Bang Theory for our son from his Christmas wish list.  He was happy to receive it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.It is so fun and addicting.I could play it all day long!I would highly reccomend getting this game!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Wuthering Heights is the tragic story of Heathcliff. At a young age he is adopted by a country gentleman who takes an indescribable fancy to him. The man's natural son however despises Heathcliff and plays a major role in developing his dastardly character. The man's daughter, Cathy, has a somewhat different view and soon realizes that she has found her soul mate. It's this love for Cathy and hatred for her brother that control Heathcliff and turn him into the devious, vengeful, monster that we come to hate for awhile. No worries though because if the book starts out grimly it more than makes up for it in the end.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really liked the book, it was a great read and page turner. I was reminded of 50 Shades of Grey when I read it but Bared had more substance, sensuality and edginess to it. Can't wait to read the next book!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|We have watched this movie with our grandchildren several times and even a few times on our own.  Great entertainment with a message about being judgmental.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|I purchased this item from Target a couple years ago.  After spending about three months looking at various stores (and not the web), I found this case.  I can't recall how much this was exactly - maybe 20 bucks or more.  Wish it was for 10 bucks because that's the<br /><br />I used this a lot to store my [[ASIN:B007T35O7U Kindle Fire 7\\", LCD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB]]<br /><br />It's an ok case but irrelevant 'while' using the kindle.  So this is more a storage case for traveling.  But even then, I think I would be using my kindle while traveling, so that might not work too.<br /><br />The \\"inner lining design\\" looks nice and cushioning.  I agree with others about how it's also a bit on the thin side.  What I noticed (and haven't seen others mention) is that the case leaves their \\"fingerprint\\" on the kindle screen.  That was a bit annoying to me as I try to keep the kindle screen clean.<br /><br />So after about 5 months or so use, I found a different case.  [[ASIN:B006HX9DZC rooCASE Dual-View Multi Angle (Purple) Folio Case Cover for Amazon Kindle Fire 7-Inch Android Tablet (NOT Compatible with Fire HD)]].  This case has been very good.  I can use this while still using my kindle.  It's also thicker board case than the Amazon case.<br /><br />I recommend the rooCase instead of the [[ASIN:B005DOL0R0 Amazon Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve, Graphite (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)]].
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Couldn't find season 2 anywhere else. Had seen season 1&3 . This fills in a lot of gaps. Really enjoy program.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just rite. Simple to use and does just what I need it to do. I use this for everyday simple math that I might use every day. I love this app. Nothing needs to be added or taken away.
0812993357|5.0|I loved reading Grace's memoir, I couldn't put it down. The pictures were great and I recommend this book to any fashion lover.

0345803507|5.0|This was a great end to the trilogy.  If I remember right, it was less steamy than the previous 2 books.  But still a great ending.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Novel had a good balance of past/present. Realistic impact of child loss, foster care system, learning to love and trust.
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Well I had to sometimes.......to conceal my boner.  It was recommended to me by a coworker.  Do you think she was trying to tell me something?
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is probably one of the most unique novels I have ever read. I have never been one for science fiction and cyborgs and spaceships, but I couldn't help getting swept up in the magic of this novel. It probably didn't hurt that this is also a retelling of the classic Cinderella. I'm a sucker for fairtytale retellings. Though it is a retelling, Cinder is also so much more.<br /><br />I didn't know how I wanted to go about writing this review. There was so much going through my mind, I couldn't make it make sense when I started trying to write it out. With that said, here are some of my thoughts. Let's start with the characters, shall we?<br /><br />Cinder is such a strong character, but she doesn't know it just yet. Cyborgs are seen as second-class citizens in this futuristic world, so Cinder doesn't believe anyone could (or should) truly care for her. She's strong, smart, caring and a gifted mechanic, but she definitely gets treated pretty horribly for being cyborg. In comes the charming Prince Kaito needing assistance with one of his androids. What a perfect meeting! He's charismatic, funny, and he cares deeply about the welfare of his country and its people. Really, Kai is everything a young prince should be. Cinder, much to her surprise, is taken by this prince charming immediately. He's an easy character to like, though. That's one more for the nice guy! Iko, Cinder's android pal, is definitely a bright spot in this otherwise dim world. She is so hilarious! It doesn't seem likely that something created out of metal parts and wires and whatnot could have such a personality, but she does. How cute is it that she has a crush on the Prince, too? Right? Right?! There's a part in the book when Iko just really steals my heart, but it's spoilery. Guess you'll just have to read it for yourself. I really liked Cinder's younger stepsister, Peony. She is pretty much just like any normal 14-year-old today. She loves sparkly things, dancing and daydreaming about meeting her favorite celebrity (surprise! She loves Prince Kai. So adorable). I really liked that the author made at least one of the stepsisters nice. Peony's older sister, Pearl, on the other hand... ooh, what a spoiled brat! I still hold out that there might be a heart somewhere hidden deep in there, but that hope may not last long if she continues on her current path. As for their mother, Adri, she is depicted in such a perfectly cold and cruel evil stepmother way. Well done, there. I couldn't believe how cruel and unfeeling she is towards Cinder. Cinder does everything for that family and she gets nothing in return. Unless you count being put down and tormented daily some kind of reward. I certainly know I don't. As if an evil stepmother isn't enough, there's the Lunar Queen, Levana. What a villain! She literally sends ripples of ice down my back with how manipulative and evil she is. She's ruling an entire nation (on the moon! what?!) by brainwashing them! She can't even look in a mirror or be filmed/photographed because she's put a glamour on herself to look beautiful. Knowing she has her sights set on the wonderful Prince Kai and his kingdom, her evil knows no bounds. Giving such a cruel and heartless being magic, well that's just wrong. So deliciously wrong! I love it. Marissa definitely did an excellent job writing some amazing, sweet, evil, rotten, strong, fantastic characters.<br /><br />The writing was fantastic and the descriptions were to die for! Though the city is all futuristic and technologically advanced, it really felt kind of... dilapidated? You could tell that circumstances weren't all that great, just from looking around the city. I really enjoyed all the descriptions of celebratory finery, though. After all, what is a Cinderella story without a ball and all the sparkles that go with it? I could almost feel the fabrics under my fingers, it was that vivid. Well done! On the opposite side of the spectrum, the descriptions of the plague are... ugh. Talk about a total gross out. It sounds painful and miserable and absolutely disgusting. Marissa definitely doesn't shy away from showing exactly what's going on with the plague and those affected by it. I feel so sorry for all those who have to suffer through that. Fortunately, I suppose, they don't have to suffer for long. I suspected something nefarious going on with the plague immediately. By the way, there's another spoilery part that will simply break your heart. Actually, there are a few. So many emotions in this book!<br /><br />Though I was able to guess a fair amount of what was going to happen, I didn't mind in the least. It was actually part of the fun waiting to see when the characters were going to figure it out for themselves. The journey was well worth the trip and I simply can't wait to jump back into this magical, terrifying world again! A definite must-read for anybody ready to get swept up in a perfect cross of fairytale and scifi. Bring on book two!<br /><br />A Favorite Quote: \\"I'm sure I'll feel much more grateful when I find a guy who thinks complex wiring in a girl is a turn-on.\\"bout a total gross out.

B001B51B9M|5.0|What a great movie.  After watching this flick I wanted to go down to the local theatre company and be in a play.

B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Replay value is great and it took me 37 hours to play in the first category. I recommend this game to anyone interested in match3 type of games. Three modes of play, including playing just a single game if time is tight. With 100 levels of play,  you'll never be bored.
0142410705|1.0|This book was an utter bore.  I really wanted to slit my wrists.  But I finished the book instead.  I couldn't really get into it.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|This game is fun. Hard to fly at first, but once you get the hang of it, it is really fun. Try it for yourself remember it free, what you have to lose.
0385742886|3.0|I don not really know.  I bought this for the daugher.  She wants me to read it though.  I still haven't.

B008A36R2Y|5.0|The board comes certified Arduino built in Italy, so it is legit. The boarditselfisamazing. Compared to the bread and butter UNO R3, this board is much smaller of a profile then the UNO. The MicroUSB is so convent and nice to have. It slims down the overall profile of the board and means I now have more options for cables and so forth.<br /><br />The old giant ATMega is gone replaced instead by a much more robust ARM based processor. The chip itself is of the SMD tech, which you can see in they turns of the item. The board came shipped in a little box, but other then that, which isn't about the item and more of shipping/retailer then the board.<br /><br />I would recommend this board as it is the same board as the UNO but half the weight and with more compatibility options. Overall fantastic purchase and I would highly recommend this product to any and all persons interested in the related fields.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I have successfully fried this board, rather easily I might add. However! One can not downgrade the product due to user error, and for that I still think the board is amazing. Even though all my digital pins are toast, the MicroUSB connection makes it a hell of a power supply. Just use a wall wart and use the Vin pin or the 3.3V & 5V pins to power your projects. The MircoUSB alone makes the whole product worth it in my opinion. Because I have several devices that utilize the MircoUSB connection, finding a wall wart to power this thing is effortless.
1400052181|4.0|Full of incredible knowledge and a great family biography.  I didn't know there was a patent on the breast cancer test and that is what the big cost is for one when a person goes in for one.
B005F2BBLK|3.0|There were many cute moment and a lot of slapstick humor. The story wasn't boring but wasn't too exciting either.  The characters were probably the most compelling thing.  Looked good.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|This series is every bit as good as everyone says. I'm only sorry we were so late to the party. Can't wait to watch Seasons 2 & 3!
B004GJYRFA|5.0|Watched all 4 seasons in one wk...could not stop. Know my parent's have it, and when they are done my kid's:)
B006P96PAO|5.0|This movie is very well done by the same group that did &#34;Fireproof&#34;.  And again, it is a film that churches all over the country can show to all men that are married or plan to be married. The lessons here are the important ones---values, commitment, honesty, integrity, manhood, marriage and family.

B00009NQQO|3.0|This was and is a welcomed addition to bath time. My son was 11 months when we got it and loves to \\"shoot hoops.\\"  The balls are neatly colored and engaging...I wish they weren't squeeze balls though bc it is difficult to keep those toys free of mildew. Solid would have been my choice. It's still in the tub and played with however the mesh hoop starting tearing away from the plastic rim within about 10 days, which is why I give 3 stars. The suction cups work great. It's never come off the tub unintentionally. Fun toy, poorly constructed.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the second time I have read this series and it was just as amazing as the first. I highly recommend this for teens and above for a great read.

B004EAFQG0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I think that Nev acted a lot more naive than he really is and I also think that it isn't a true documentary. But it's enjoyable enough to watch.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Love the app.  Stopped paying for satellite radio in favor of this.<br /><br />For everyone having trouble with the update just uninstall and reinstall.  Worked great for me.

B005YVTHT0|4.0|Nice wheel. Not too big and not too heavy. It's a little difficult to reach some of the buttons while also using the throttle and brake paddles (I need larger hands, lol). The game that it's for seems to be pretty good, but the wheel has worked with every driving game I've tried it with so far. The steering is responsive and consistent and the throttle and brake levers have a nice long travel for good control. My wheel came with a $10 gift card for use in the Simraceway game. The card said it expired on March 31st, but it still worked on the April 6th. Exactly enough to buy 25 of the most popular cars in the game.
B00ALCBU4M|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was packed with action and never tried to be anything other than pure entertainment.  This is action adventure at its best.  Highly recommend!  Oh yeah, I'm partial.  I directed it!

B008BGNMZU|3.0|Having collected each and every project this group has ever recorded I continued my quest and was merely 'satisfied' with this latest offering. Over the years I have heard better from Fourplay, even though this is not purely negative critique. Even as I have followed and attended each and every one their concerts in my area I have been asking myself and other music lovers which direction this group seems to heading. From the first track on their very first CD, Fourplay has always delivered a style that we grew to appreciate. But as of late, throughout their last 2 or 3 CDs, the flavor of their music has taken a twist into an area that has myself and others needing to allow their music to grow on us. I am a true to heart Bob James fan and do see this latest offering in the area of some of Bob's earlier works. Again, this is not a complaint, but not exactly what I was expecting.
B0006B2A42|4.0|A great old classic that you can't find to stream.  One of the first \\"spy\\" type movies that I ever remember seeing.
B005PK57IK|4.0|like the previous two seasons, these episodes are interesting, well-performed, entertainment !<br />The tension in the office is palpable, and you keep waiting for the next shoe to drop!

B005LJKEXS|3.0|It's going to disconnect frequently if you're connecting it to something that doesn't have its own power supply.  If you're trying to connect a wireless adapter to this to send your internet closer to a router, don't bother.  You'll be angry at how often you're disconnecting from the internet.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|DO NOT UPLOAD THIS SOFTWARE AS AN UPDATE UNTIL A SERIOUS BUG IS FIXED.  I used this software with ZERO issues for months, but since installing an update in early April my Kindle Fire has required multiple hard restarts each day.  I finally removed from my device and now my Kindle works w/NO issues.  I WILL TRY AGAIN IN A WEEK OR SO.  THE BUG AFFECTS THE &quot;SYSTEM LOADER.&quot;  Aggravating.
B007T99ENE|5.0|I think this is one of Ian McEwan's best, I was a absorbed. Intriguing, beautifully written (as always), and a great twist.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved loved the story. was very shocked at the end. also the book was far better then the movie. I really wished the movie followed the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game to have on the Kindle fire HD. I play it almost every day! It is the best.
B0000041Z5|5.0|Very good recordings of very good symphonies.  I get a lot of enjoyment out of this 4 disc set.  Also, having grown up in Chicago, I have been listening to the CSO for a long time.  Very good orchestra, and Solti was one of its great conductors.
B006LSZECO|4.0|what makes this book unique is the multiple perspective that captures the voices of both the man and woman in a failing marriage. the books unexpected twists and turns will take you on a journey from the realistic pains of relationship failures to a world of fantastical deception. Almost 5 points because it has been a long time since I've read a book in which I can't predict what happens next...One point off because of a reason I won't say to avoid spoiling the ending!
B00A4AI0AS|5.0|Klemperer was a great conductor.  He was manic-depressive, suffered partial paralysis as a result of an opertaion for a brain tumor which did not go as well as hoped, and suffered serious burns when he fell asleep in bed smoking a cigarette and then tried to put out the flames with a liquid which acted as an accellerant.  He could be irrascibile and tyrannical, but he always worked to do justice to the music which he conducted.  He was well-known for his work in the symphonic and operatic repertoire, but not as noted for his work as an accompanist in concertos.<br /><br />This set presents his collaboration in the 5 Beethoven piano concertos, with Barenboim as soloist, along with the Choral Fantasia, also with Barenboim at the keyboard.  Also included are his collaborations with David Oistrakh (Brahms violin concerto); Annie Fischer (Schumann piano concerto and Liszt first piano concerto); Barenboim, again (Mozart Piano Concerto No. 25); Menuhim (Beethoven violin concerto); and Alan Civil (Mozart horn concertos).<br /><br />In Beethoven, of which Klemperer was one of the greatest masters, he brings his typical mammouth apporach, in which the orchestra sounds full, dramatic, and purposeful.  This is not to say that the orchestral accompanment is stodgy or stoltifying; to the contrary, it has such authority that it seems as if Moses brought it down from Mount Sinai.  It is satisfying and not prissy in the slightest.  Barenboim is fully up the the task and the set of concertos, along withg the Choral Fantasy, is one of the best on the market, in my opinion.  I had this set in the LP format and the CDs have a greater clarity of sound.<br /><br />The Mozart piano concerto is superlative, and Baremboim shines.<br /><br />The Mozart horn concertos are one of the glories of recorded music.  Civil, who occupied first chair with the Philharmonia Orchestra, recorded these concertos again, but with other conductors and orchestras.  I consider the recordings in this set to be Civil's most satisfying recorded effort in this music.  Klemperer, a marvelous Mozartean, brings out Civil at his best and the orchestral contribution is outstanding.<br /><br />The Brahms concerto with Oistrakh is also on an exalted level.  Oistrakh, who was one of the Titans of the violin, was an eminent protaganistic of this concerto.  I recall attending a concert at Carnegie Hall well over 40 years ago where he played this concerto with the Moscow Philharmonic, with Kiril Kondrashin conducting, and I recall it as masterful.  The recording here is in the same league, except that Klemperer was a finer Brahmsian than Kondrashin.<br /><br />The Beethoven Violin Concerto with Menuhin is in the good, but not great, category.  Menuhin's playing in this recording is not in the same league as Milstein's, Heifetz's or Francescatti's.  By the time of this recording, in 1966, Menuhin's playing was past its prime.<br /><br />The Annie Fischer performances are very fine, as is Klemperer's accompaniment.<br /><br />All in all, I rate this set as deserving 5 stars.  When one considers the minimal price which Amazon is charging for the 5 discs, it is a virtual steal.  Anyone who loves music should obtain it.

0307454568|5.0|The finale of the Millennium trilogy is a satisfying conclusion to the story of Lisbeth Salander began in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Taking up where The Girl Who Played with Fire left off, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest follows first Lisbeth's struggle for first life and then her freedom with the assistance of Mikael Blomkvist and host of others.  The introduction of \\"the Section\\" from within the Swedish Security Service in the role as the antagonist helps move the majority of the story arcs along in an unexpected twist than what one assumes is going to happen.<br /><br />The development of each established and newly introduced character throughout the book is not only well done, but welcome after devoting so much time invested in them.  The most important development is that of Lisbeth herself who transforms from someone uncompromising to someone who realizes her position as a full citizen after seeing all her demons expunged from her life, but only after a thrilling epilogue that wraps all the loose ends.<br /><br />I can not express enough how much I love this book, but I read the last half of the book in just two days and as the title of my review states it hurt to put this book down when I had to.

1457514508|5.0|I read this book in one sitting! Loved how the author linked the characters in a general way and then surprise links throughout the book. Also enjoyed that Chapter 1, which drew me in, was repeated in Chapter 18, so that you knew something was going to happen, but had to read the entire book to find out who and what! Other surprises in the end make me look forward to the next episode of this neighborhood in Savannah!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|It's not a great film, but truly did keep me going from start to finish.<br /> I would recommend it if you want an action piece- with some heart.

B007ZD17XO|4.0|I really liked this game good  for hand and eye coordination. fun to try to match colors up to win the coins.
0307593312|5.0|Recommended reading.  I liked this book immensely.  An intriguing story line, while a bit drawn out, it keeps ones interest to the very end.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I was interested in the story from the first page and had trouble putting the book down.  The main characters you fall in love with, their friends are also great characters.  A book that is hard to put down
B00846REIS|3.0|Sounds way to similar to Fifty Shades..... younger girl falls for<br />Rich, sexy CEO that dominates her while dealing with ex's and secret pasts. Was hoping for a different story line while still keeping heading down that erotic path.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Inexpensive for the quality. I've owned this microphone for several months and I've been very happy with it. I use it with a Canon DSLR.

1451635672|3.0|I was thrilled that my daughter's boyfriend bought Casino by Nicholas Pileggi for me as a birthday present.  This has long been a TBR that I hoped to own one day, and I immediately began reading it, despite the fact that I had five other books going.  Pileggi, who collaborated with Martin Scorcese to turn his non-fiction book Wiseguy about mobster Henry Hill into the critically acclaimed film masterpiece Goodfellas, reprises this effort with Casino.  Pileggi wrote the screenplay for both films - each directed by Scorcese and casting Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent as various underworld characters - which are among my all-time favorite movies. I read Wiseguy sometime back and I always wanted to read Casino.<br /> Like Wiseguy, the book version of Casino is very different from the film.  A narrative of actual events heavily dependent upon interviews and transcripts, the dramatic element so essential to the film is largely absent here, most prominently because of the way the story is told.  For movie fans, it comes as somewhat of a disappointed that while the majority of the people and events depicted in the film are real, many did not occur in the order or the manner related on the screen. However, for those readers interested in the mob and its inner-workings, the factual components of the book are quite fascinating.  Still, there remains a kind of dissonance in that the author of the book and the screenplay are the same individual, and the screenplay is, after all, so much more exciting - at least as Scorcese translates it to celluloid.<br /> I'm not sure that anyone who never saw Casino would be interested in its eponymous book, although I was taken enough by the content to read it in its entirety in just a few days.  At the end of the day, it makes a fine complement to the film, which I look forward to screening again very soon so I can compare truth and fiction while it remains fresh in my head.

076535618X|5.0|If you like Sci-Fi, if you like classic Sci-Fi, if you like Heinlein, if you enjoy militaria, plot twists and a heaping dash of humor - you will love this book. It's a fitting end to the story cycle and (thankfully) he goes out on top before wearing out his welcome.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|I've had this case since Christmas (Dec 25 2012) it has provided great protection for my kindle fire. It took a little while to figure out the best way to use it as a stand but once I found it this case had been nothing but good to me. My kindle goes everywhere I go, it gets thrown in the car, tossed in my back pack for school, and my purse. The white outer coloring is a bit dirty but no deep scratches, and the kindle is in perfect condition. The strap the goods the cover on, I thought for sure would have come loose by now. There is a little wave in the strap, but it still seals tightly & my screen isn't harmed as of yet. Overall I would recommend this case to anyone!

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book details the tragic account of SEAL Team 10's final days in Afghanistan accompanied by the pride that such an amazing group of young Americans died for the freedoms we enjoy.  As a Marine, I have always looked up to our SEAL Teams as bad asses.  I could only hope I would have been as brave as these young men if the occasion arose.  May we all take a short bit of time from our busy days and read this book to realize the courage, honor and commitment these SEALs possess.  Share this story and learn from these selfless young men what true patriotism is - in a time where that term is thrown around as political ammunition toward the opposing party.  War knows no political boundaries when our country is being threatened.  Thanks to every Navy SEAL who ever served. You are inspirational and I will read this testament to my children so they may know who our heroes really are.

B005LAII4E|1.0|I can't believe I'm going to say this, but I think Stephen Sommers's G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is better than Jon M. Chu's sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation and I believe Sommers is a bad if not terrible director. Let's move back for a second. Over a year ago I was hopeful and near excited about the G.I. Joe sequel. Sommers wasn't coming back and Hasbro along with Skydance productions added the likes of Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson, Bruce Willis, Ray Stevenson and Adrianne Palicki along with bringing back Ray Park and Byung-hun Lee. That along with a good trailer was I was hesitantly hopeful that G.I. Joe: Retaliation would be a step up from its average predecessor. G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra was a decent film that was major hampered by a poor script, with some bad acting mainly on the parts of Marlon Wayans and Channing Tatum. I still don't understand the appeal of Tatum. Sure he's a good looking guy, but he's an average actor at best. With him originally not really being included in the sequel along with everything else there was hope for Retaliation. That was before Hasbro, Paramount Pictures and the rest of the studios involved decided to delay the film for nearly a year. Why because they wanted to cut up their already finished film so they could add more scenes for Tatum and to make the film 3D.<br /><br />All right let's get The Ugly.<br /><br />Channing Tatum: I've already said I think the actor is just not very good and his scenes in the film just seemed forced and I think anyone who sees the film can tell that certain scenes were added into the film. I am almost positive the scene early in the film with Duke (Tatum) and Roadblock (The Rock) sitting on the couch playing a video game. It seems like an easy scene the producers could have added and wouldn't have taken much time.<br /><br />Plot: It's not necessarily the plot that sucks it's the total overlooking consequences or continuum from the first film yet it's supposed to be a sequel. First there is Cobra Commander and Destro who were imprisoned in the Joe's main base which if I remember correctly was somewhere in the Middle East. Yet in Retaliation they're locked away in a prison in Europe, and let's talk about the prison for a second. I know with films like this you're supposed to suspend believe, but it just didn't make sense. The prison seemed small like it was only built to house those two and then there was the security. If you're housing two criminals who tried to and killed thousands of lives you'd think they'd be much more security. How did Tatum become the head of G.I. Joe and what happened to the main base. The film never mentions that or what happened to some of the characters from the previous films like Ripcord, Heavy Duty, General Hawk or Scarlet. The film didn't have to go into real detail, but at least mention where they are or what happened to them. These big flaws along with other in the writing took a lot away from the film.<br /><br />Editing: The addition of scenes forced into the film was poorly done. You can tell where things were edited out or added in. It's one thing to delay a film so it can be converted to 3D it's another thing to try to force in additional scenes after a film is already done. It certainly didn't work here.<br /><br />RZA: Who is RZA and what the hell was he doing in this film? That just didn't make sense and him playing Blind Master was just laughable.<br /><br />Jon M. Chu: Having Chu the director of Retaliation was one of the things I didn't like. He had only directed Step Up films along with Justin Bieber: Never Say Never. He's never done a film like this before and it shows. The action scenes while decent aren't well done and not better than the original. He obviously doesn't have any ability to direct real actors or filming action scenes.<br /><br />Let's move onto The Bad<br /><br />Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow: In the first film these two stole the film with really good action scenes. In Retaliation the characters just seemed to have been force into the back ground and the plot with them was just badly written.<br /><br />The Rock: I like Dwayne Johnson he's a decent actor who has a great personality, but here in Retaliation playing Roadblock he was an empty shell of a character with no personality. The Rocks action scenes were well done, but that was it.<br /><br />Bruce Willis: The great action star would seem like a logical choice to be in a G.I. Joe film, but just like with the latest Die Hard film and The Expendables 2 it just didn't work. It just seemed like he was forced into the film and just a plot point. I have no doubt Roadblock and the rest of the Joes could have found out what Cobra was doing without General Joseph Colton's help and that includes weapons. Bruce Willis has certainly made some bad choices with his last few films.<br /><br />Let's move on to The Good (Yes there were few things I liked about the film.)<br /><br />Firefly: I loved the character in the comics and I thought Ray Stevenson did a good job portraying the character.<br /><br />Flint: I'm sure others will disagree, but I thought the little known actor D.J. Cotrona did a good job. Though Cotrona and Flint don't have a ton of screen time or character development I did enjoy the actor and his portrayal of Flint.<br /><br />Lady Jaye: Yes it's a guilty pleasure in that Adrianne Palicki is gorgeous and having her in a film just makes any film a tiny bit better, but here in Retaliation I think she did a good job. Palicki had a chance to shine as Jaye was one of the few characters to actually have personality and actual character depth. Adrianne's performance was good and along with her looks helped the film a little bit in my opinion.<br /><br />Well that's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of G.I. Joe Retaliation. Paramount delayed the film for nearly a year and what did we receive in return? We got back garbage with a poorly developed script, terrible directing, decent acting and action/effects. Overall I thinkit was a mistake to delay the film to force in more scenes with Tatum and convert the film to 3D. I would like to see what the original version of the film looked like. I bet it was and is better than the version the studios gave us. I highly don't recommend this film as a waste of money and time. I wish this film would bomb so the franchise could be rebooted down the road by another studio than maybe we and I could get the version of G.I. Joe that is actually good.

B009AMAJVO|4.0|Wow who knew WWE Studios could actually make a good film. From the trailers I first saw a few months ago the film looked like a really good action thriller yet there was no sign that WWE produced this film and I think that was purposely done by WWE Studios and the distributor studio in FilmDistrict. I mean when you bring up WWE Studios a good film certainly isn't the first thing that comes to mind. The only half way decent film they produced was The Condemned with Steve Austin. It was stupid fun thrill ride, but at best was a two and half to three star film, so I can understand why I didn't see the WWE's name openly attached to Dead Man Down. I think this was the first film WWE actually took seriously putting time and money into the film, and bringing in a good cast and director. Still when I learned that the WWE was a part of Dead Man Down a few days ago my expectations for the film dropped considerably, and I think that was a good thing because I was pleasantly surprised that Dead Man Down is a good film.<br /><br />The film starts off with Darcy (Dominic Cooper) showing off his newborn child to Victor (Colin Farrell) and telling him he finally realizes that humans weren't meant to be alone, and common thread to this revenge film that tries to deal with the themes of revenge what it does to people and whether getting revenge will get rid of the scars and pain that has been inflicted on us. What Darcy doesn't know is that Victor has infiltrated Darcy's gang run by the ruthless Alphonse Hoyt (Terrence Howard) to get revenge. Things get complicated for Victor when he meets another damaged soul in Beatrice (Noomi Rapace) across from him in another apartment building. The two bond as they are searching for revenge and in doing so slowly begin to live again. The story was written by J. H. Wyman who Fringe fans might recognize. He was a writer and eventual co-show runner, and even though I believe this is his first feature film it doesn't show as he did a good job with the script giving a great story. Is the pacing of the story perfect? No as there are dead moments that last a little too long and there is almost no depth to Alphonse character. Still Wyman wrote a good action/thriller.<br /><br />Colin Farrell is a strange actor. He has the potential to give good if not outstanding performances in films like Tigerland, Minority Report, Miami Vice and The New World, but he can also give really bad performances in film like Phone Booth, American Outlaws and Alexander. He's almost never consistent from film to film. I'm not sure whether he actually tries or it's the script that is bad. In any even his performance in Dead Man Down is one of his better acting jobs. Victor doesn't have a ton of dialog. Instead Colin brings facial expressions and emotion to the role as he deals with his feelings of revenge and you can see he begins to slowly doubt his purpose as he grows closer to Beatrice. Noomi Rapace fresh off her good performance in Prometheus gives another good acting job here in Dead Man Down as Beatrice a fiscally scarred woman caused by accident who is seeking revenge on the man who caused her accident. The small supporting cast also does a good job. Dominic Cooper does a good job playing Victor's friend. Isabelle Huppert does a splendid job playing Beatrice's mother and F. Murray Abraham does an excellent job in his small supporting role as Victor's uncle in law. Again the only flaw in was with Terrence Howard. He was supposed to give of this vibe of being a scary gangster, but Terrence doesn't do a great job. Also I am Armand Assante fan. He's a really good actor who only has a brief appearance in the film. I think he could have done a better job playing the bad guy than Terrence Howard did.<br /><br />Was there a ton of action in Dead Man Down? No there wasn't. You could say the trailers are a little miss leading in that department, but Dead Man Down is more of an action/drama/thriller. Still the action is riveting. From one scene in a Jamaican drug den. It was gritty thrilling and well down. There was another scene in an apartment building where Victor is trying to escape. It's well planned and thought out. I won't give anything else away because there isn't a ton of action, but all of it is well done. I wish films like Gangster Squad and Die Hard had gone this route because Dead Man Down's action is much better than those films.<br /><br />I don't know much about director Niels Arden Oplev. About all I know about him is that he directed the Swedish version of The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo which also starred Noomi Rapace and I never saw the film, so I have no knowledge or preconceived notions about the director. From watching Dead Man Down I can say that he is a good director. He does a good job directing both the action and drama and I believe he brought out the best in his actors. There was another graduate from the Swedish Girl With The Dragon Tatoo series in composer Jacob Groth. Is the music great? No, but Groth does do a good job fitting the music to each scene.<br /><br />I know the mention of WWE might make people hesitant about seeing this film. I know it did for me and I'm sure this will be an anomaly for WWE Studios, but Dead Man Down is a good film with a decent cast, good acting, riveting action, a detailed story about revenge and finding the will to live again along with a good director and a decent score. Give Dead Man Down a try. Don't let the WWE scare you and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

B00A4OALL0|5.0|At 79 years old, Wayne Shorter and his quartet (together with a bunch of guest horn players as sidemen) have produced a kind of jazz masterpiece, the definitive statement to round off a long and illustrious career.<br /><br />Always the quintessential musician's musician, Shorter remains true to his lifelong principles and emphatically refuses to play safe. `Without a Net' is a collection of the quartet's onstage performances from their recent European and US tours. Each of the nine pieces takes the basic theme of the number and then (usually - but not always - led by Shorter's sax) explores a new musical landscape through lengthy improvisation, the result by turns experimental and inventive, jarringly atonal or melodically sublime. An almost telepathic level of communication exists between these A-list musicians, each at the top of their game and collectively creating possibly the most seminal musical improvisations of our age. Each performance is unique, never-to-be-repeated.<br /><br />Ambient background dinner party jazz this definitely ain't. What Shorter offers the listener is jazz as high art: imaginative, never afraid to break boundaries, visionary and often delightfully unexpected.<br /><br />The jewel-case and four-page foldout insert don't exactly make for a premium package, and the simple (though distinctive in an understated way) artwork is unlikely to be destined for `classic design' status either. But this music is deep, profound, courageous, sublime. Press `play', crank up the volume and prepare to be blown away by the sheer virtuosity and inventive brilliance about to assault your ears.

B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I just finished watching it.  The reviewer with the q & a got it all right.  My mouth was on the floor.  It makes \\"Anaconda\\" look like Shakespeare.  Well, at least Anaconda knows you're laughing with it, not at it.  Plus, Anaconda has much better bad acting and funnier bad dialogue.  And, Anaconda's plot is actually more believable --  in an unbelievably bad sort of way.  If you like watching train wrecks, this one's for you.  I recommend getting your pals down to the man cave, ingesting mass quantities of your substance of choice, and howling until your bellies ache.  Seriously, the blunders of the characters are so incredible as to make any clueless teen in a slasher flick seem like a genius.  This one is not to be believed.
0141034599|4.0|Black Swan is Nassim Talebs attempt to convince readers of a couple of things: that as the world becomes more \\"technical\\", it also becomes less robust; that some systems, such as national & international monetary systems, should be managed with more insight & care. While his premise is reasonable, his presentation is inelegant. Talebs colorful personality leaks into every clarification; I personally found this trait amusing but could see how it might be annoying & confusing. This book was supposed to be a warning of the growing fragility of our monetary systems and the world; it also is a memoir/philosophic-manifesto of sorts...maybe it was just too much for many, but I still enjoy it immensely.

I cried more than once while reading through the last few chapters. I shared my thoughts/emotion about this book with friends & family and as a result two of my friends read & loved it and now my mother & oldest daughter are reading it too. This is a must read.

B0030U1TW0|5.0|What if this album had actually come with a free hand? As in, an actual severed extremity for no additional charge. I wonder if that would've helped or hindered sales. Hindered, probably, if they'd left the blood on.<br /><br />I guess we'll never know, because this album just comes with, well, itself. But that's ok. You don't need a free hand to enjoy \\"Free Hand\\". At least not in the sense just described. You would probably need at least one free hand, in the more commonly used, less literal sense, to put the CD in the player (or the vinyl record on the turntable, for you \\"hipsters\\"), which would be necessary to enjoy the record, because if the record, regardless of format, isn't being played, you wouldn't be able to listen to it, and then you wouldn't be able to enjoy it. Now, listening to it doesn't necessarily mean you'll enjoy it. And I suppose if you've listened to it before, you could enjoy it again without listening to it, but then again, that still involves having listened to it at some point. I really like the bassline on \\"Time to Kill\\".<br /><br />Gentle Giant play complicated music. Certainly Kerry Minnear didn't have a \\"free hand\\" when performing this record's intricate keyboard parts! Unless he had obtained one in the literal sense, maybe one of the ones they didn't end up giving away with the album after all, and rested it on his keyboard while playing. But I don't think that's very likely.<br /><br />How come they let Gary Green only get away with playing the recorder in addition to his main axe? Why didn't they make him also play an actual axe? That would have been a challenge. It's hard to make a musical sound with an axe.<br /><br />Free Hand wouldn't have been a very good record if it had been made only using an axe, even if it was the axe that was also used to sever the free hands from their original limbs.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|Magnificent functionality. Numerous Options. $2Is. IsIs A Steal!<br />I love The Night stand Clock.  The Mixing  Of Sounds Is GenIus
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This is such a great CD and a double one too! You can't help but find yourself singing along,swaying to the beat, even dancing around the house. This is a definite buy!!!
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|honestly, i don't use this much. but it does what it's supposed to, log in, look at what you need to, update what you want and so on.  crashes on occasion but most apps do that from time to time.  If you are a linkedin user that wants regular access, this is for you.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This picked up where the first novel left off but as one got into it there were several twists and occurancs that holds your interest and surprises you in the end.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I got this thinking it would be great fun. i use it on my kindle and i never know when people made their move with out actually opening the game.  The words they give you to draw aren't that great and you can literally just write the work on the screen and have someone guess it  because the more right answers the better.  Also, games never end and at least playing on my kindle you cannot delete opponents so you are just constantly playing them even if your opponent stops responding.
B0083Z6AH6|2.0|a very, very boring story . It is very difficult to keep the interest in this reading. Although its vocabulary is  rich and descriptive but one just goes pages and pages before anything appends
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It doesn't take long to get past the surreal premise of this series.  It is story telling at its best.
B001BC5HXG|4.0|This book is easy to read and has a story thyat take you interested from the beginning to the end. Although some times it is difficult to keep up with the characters
B009FZFONO|5.0|You have to be okay with guts and gore. The entire Walking Dead series has been suspenseful and exciting.  Season 3 is set in a jail.  I'll leave the rest to your viewing, but this is a season not to be missed!
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Jeff Fox has shown how a person with no expertise in the field, using only innuendo, a camera and a banjo can sucker in dozens if not hundreds of people.  His presentation of flaming faucets is real showmanship.  Nevermind that it occurs in areas where there has never been fracking - why let facts get in the way of a good story?  His implication that the process of breaking rock deep in the earth makes animals sick is a master stroke of misdirection, but he pulls it off. What a genius! It reminds me of Penn and Teller's petition to ban Dihydrogen Monoxide.  Hundreds signed it.  Would you?<br /><br />While watching the 'Gasland' trailer on youtube you'll find a video called 'truthland.'  I recommend it.  Deals with facts and boring stuff about fracking.<br /><br />WRT 'tap water that bursts into flame:' There are at least three places in the USA that were known as 'burning springs' about 500 years before J.Fox 'discovered' burnable gas in water (to say the water 'burns' is incredibly misleading - it effervesces methane. For the agenda-burdened, that's a detail worth overlooking) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Springs<br /><br />The argument that this gas is the result of fracking is further weakened by the distinction between biogenic and thermogenic gas. Biogenic gas arises from fairly recent decomp near the surface - such as coal beds - that migrates into the water table. Thermogenic gas comes from considerable depth and is older than biogenic gas. Carbon dating can distinguish between the two sources. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasland<br /><br />Science is the search for the truth, often by a process of elimination and applying rules of logic. The scientific method is a process of observing, hypothesizing and attempting to disprove the hypothesis http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method . If you disprove it, start over. If you cannot disprove it, it might be true, so revise the tests and re-do. Then share the methodology and results with others to replicate. Then write a report, get a peer review, re-write and publish. Repeat as the feedback comes in. It's slow, methodical and not very titillating. It leads to the truth, but first it will make you mad.<br /><br />In the 60's the advice was: If you don't have the training or patience to do science; Or have a point of view that is not supported by science; Write a book. People like Rachel Carson and Paul Ehrlich made broad claims and crazy predictions - none of which came true - but they made millions, so why let facts get in the way of a good story?<br /><br />Today: Make a movie. Claim entertainment as education or worse: A documentary. The more spectacular the show the more 'educational' it will be. Bring on 'burning waters.'<br /><br />Fox doesn't say if he knew about burning springs, but it's easy enough to Google. If he didn't know about it his research was not very thorough. If he did know it, his movie is a fraud. Ignoring natural sources as a competing hypothesis is dishonest, but hey, why let facts get in the way of a good story? It's good showmanship, but awful science.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My husband loves it. I am hoping you will have some new Angry Bird games coming out soon. Sure help him pass the time this winter.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|This book had so much going on that I couldn't figure out how to write a short, coherent plot summary! But, it also tells you something about the book. This book won numerous awards last year (NY Times Bestseller, National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist, Best Book of the Year by multiple big name newspapers including The Washington Post and the WSJ) but, unfortunately, joins The Round House in my \\"don't let the big awards fool you\\" category.<br /><br />Before I talk about why I'm only giving this 2 stars, I should say that I found the topic of life in North Korea absolutely fascinating and I learned a lot about a mysterious (and terrifying!) country. There were long stretches of the book where I forgot this was set in present day - North Korea is so backward that I kept thinking I was reading about the early 1900′s until some mention of \\"Nikes\\" from Japan or \\"ATM's\\" in Seoul jarred me back to reality. The \\"Conversation\\" section with the author at the end of the book about what was true vs. fiction about life in North Korea is definitely worth reading.<br /><br />On to the book...the first half was such a slog. I had to force myself through it and wanted to put it down many times. I should have felt something emotional for the characters and the conditions they live under (insanely constricting rules, constant government propaganda, mysterious \\"disappearances\\" of loved ones to labor camps, labor camp conditions, food rations and hunger, astounding brutality, etc), but I just didn't feel it. The characters felt less like humans and more like paper dolls to me. Many of them didn't have names, which bothered me and contributed to the one-dimensional feeling. The second half did pick up considerably, but not enough to make the first half slog worth it.<br /><br />There was also just too much going on in the plot. Jun Do did so many loosely related things in the first half that I couldn't remember them all during the second half...nor do I think they mattered all that much to the central story of him trying to save Sun Moon.<br /><br />Finally, there is a parallel \\"government sanctioned\\" version of the story that is being told to citizens over the national loudspeaker system throughout the entire book. I appreciate the message Johnson is trying to convey by including this, but I would sometimes forget if I was reading the \\"real\\" story or the propaganda version, just adding to the confusion.<br /><br />While The Orphan Master's Son was deemed masterful and important by the \\"literary community\\", it doesn't stand up to my primary criteria of \\"was it enjoyable to read and/or was I engrossed in it?\\".<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.at much to the central story of him trying to save Sun Moon.<br /><br />Finally, there is a parallel \\"government sanctioned\\" version of the story that is being told to citizens over the national loudspeaker system throughout the entire book.

030758836X|3.0|The begginning was slow but as the book went on it became<br />very interesting and I could not put the book down.<br />The ending was terrible the writer did not put too much<br />thought on how the book was going to end.
B009EAO38C|5.0|great variety of songs on this CD; these guys are very talented! I would recommend this CD for any music lover.
B004SMYQ8I|1.0|First time i got shoe bite after wearing this. I won't suggest any one to go for this one.<br /><br />Thx
030758836X|3.0|Gone girl : A Novel<br /><br />Weird ending.  The writing is compelling, but the character is so unusual, it is hard to comprehend someone like that.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|great game love to play it, hope it has many levels to complete on.  highly recommended.  buy it, yo will love it
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I got hooked on middle earth a really long time ago when I read \\"The Hobbit\\". (Long before a movie was ever released). After waiting for years to complete \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\" series I swore I would not do that again. I made up my mind to wait until all the \\"Hobbit\\" movies were available before I watched any of them.<br />Apparently I failed.<br />I really enjoyed the movie but was not able to give it a 5 star rating because now I have to wait until 2014 to finish the complete movie.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|An intelligent SF movie well directed by Danny Boyle and well acted by the entire cast. Rather then the usual human vs. evil aliens, &#34;Sunshine&#34; depicts a natural disaster ala &#34;Deep Impact&#34; (another great flick!) and does it quite well.<br /><br />This is the second &#34;Sunshine&#34; Blu-Ray disk I've owned...the first had a problem with the commentary playing in scenes when that option (extra) wasn't selected. I'm happy to write the latest disk does not share that distraction!
B00B2DSK06|4.0|It's not easy being the bad guy but someone has to do it.  That's Ralph's job, to break things so they game's hero Felix can fix them.  These personable game characters take us into their arcade world and show their roles in the game and how they are all important to one another.  Very appealing to kids who like video games of course and enjoyable for the whole family and all ages.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|The DVD version (I've had for a couple years) had washed out color...just wasn't too good. In fact, not as good as when watching this great flick on Turner Classic Movies. The Blu-Ray version is greatly improved.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|&#34;Dad, 30 years ago you promised. I remember we were both eating mice and you specifically said that you gave me your word...&#34;  These are the words of Mavis Dracula as she expresses her desire to go out and explore the world outside of Hotel Transylvania.  Her father built the hotel with the intentions of keeping his daughter safe from humans and offering a haven for all monsters and horror characters.<br /><br />This movie is a lot of fun, great for all ages.  There are a number of catchy quotes my family likes to share and repeat along with the movie or at the breakfast table!  It's got everything from romance to coming of age, parenting struggles and even fart humor.  What's not to like?
B00005R24K|5.0|I went around looking for this 1979 classic all over the place but could not find it.  Until one day, I decided to look it up on Google.  There I found The Evil Dead DVD for reasonable price.  The DVD was in great condition, and the movie was even better.  I'm so glad I went to Amazon.
B00170MYIS|5.0|This is a very good product.  It is a great buy and in the future I will purchase batteries from this site.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This is quite a lot more than your usual whoddunit. It's more of a &#34;whydoneit.&#34; It's consistently intelligent and well written, and perfectly paced, with welcome dashes of humour. I found some psychological  implausibilities and a few characters I would rather have seen a bit more of towards the end -the twin sister I think, is left thematically stranded, maybe because a second part has been planned and strands needed to be left hanging? In any case, you won't regret giving it a go. Love turns to hate, brilliance turns nasty, charming turns sinister... It's a lot of fun!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wish they didn't kill off Matt....he was my favorite character.<br />Very disappointing.....but I love the series and can't wait for Season 4.
B008TRUDAS|2.0|Like many people I rely on amazon reviews and this one has an incredible number of great reviews, so I jumped to purchase it. I did finish it... but only because I was listening to the audible edition and it gave me something to do while I cleaned the house.<br /><br />I have to say I was so baffled the whole time I was listening to it as to why it got so much attention. I did read the many rumors about the author 'gaming' the amazon reviews (drumming up people over social media to review it positively to pump up sales), and when a first-time author gets unprecedented good reviews in the first 7 seven days of publication for a mediocre book you do have to wonder. Of course the reviews cause more people to purchase it (people like me who rely on the reviews) - causing it to leap to the bestselller list. I know the author has denied this and said that the band that she quotes throughout the book brought a lot of attention to the book through twitter. That could be, I suppose true that the band brought on the extra sales of the book- but either way it's cheating and caused many of us to waste our money. There is no way that in a 4 month period THIS book has almost as many great reviews as bestsellers that were on the NY times best seller list for years and have had major motion pictures made about them (like the Twilight books, etc). There is something really wrong going on with the reviews. The book is a 2, MAYBE 3 star at best. I hope if you agree with me you'll review it to drown out all the fake reviews that are causing this book to get all the unwarranted attention.<br /><br />If you look up lismania, best top romance books, romance reader's rviews, etc. you will get lists of the top romance novels ever written. There are a dozen or so books that show up on every list. These books don't have a fraction of the votes and positive reviews that Slammed has and they are 1000 times better.<br /><br />In a good romance I will often times develop a crush on the main character, as though I know him. And usually there is something distictly different about the main female character that would make the guy like her above all others. The couple in this book meet, are attracted to each other, go out on one (yes, one) date, kiss one time (yes, just one kiss) and the rest of the book is this hearbroken, love sick fest about how they can't live without each other. They don't have any banter between them on the date that would show why they'd be so into each other. Neither of them are particularly witty, funny, or have any strong attributes. Nothing stands out about either of them. There's no flirting, teasing, or any arguing to build sexual tension. In fact there isn't much converation between them at all- and on that date they don't even find out the normal things you would first find out about one another... like what do you do for a living or where do you go to college, etc, which leads to their 'conflict,' which is just stupid since they didn't know each other in the first place. It grows more and more ridiculous as the book goes on. It's obvious they are going to do a poetry slam to each other and of course they do, but it's not terribly climatic, and didn't really sweep me away. Both main characters are incredibly boring.<br /><br />I'm hoping this doesn't become a trend with reviews on amazon and that we'll be able to trust them in the future. I really don't recommend this book... there are plenty of others that you can really get absorbed in, are page turners, filled with emotion and where you really get to know the characters.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|It may be a predictable story line, but I've watched this movie several times and it always provides me with a good dose of romance!  I like all four major actors/actresses and feel they give a good performance.  I particularly enjoy the character played by Kate Winslet, and how she works through her struggle of giving up the man she thinks she loves in return for a true love based on mutual respect.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|so much fun! highly recommended! you'll love this game. I do! get it now!!!!!!!!!!! combat is fun. graphics are great and it runs smooth on the kindle fire.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This is all about retro... 2D retro, 3D retro, adding other retro game within it, clean interface, game response is great. I am loving it!!! Highly recommended.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Pudding monsters is a great &quot;mind flexing&quot; sort of game with stunning visuals and a amusing plot overall it's WORTH IT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun game for young or old.  my 5 year old says this game is nice.  Shespends a lot of time playing andremains interested.
B007UR1OHO|5.0|The Vow is an amazing movie. It shows that no matter what true love goes through it will always be there.
B008220D7S|1.0|It is difficult to imagine how and why such talented actors would sign on for such a stupid movie. This had so much potential, but the dialogue absolutely DESTROYED it. It was absolutely ridiculous - and I mean absurdly, unbelievably ridiculous. I can't recall ever having heard dialogue in a movie that was dumber than this. I suspect a high school student in his or her first drama class could write better dialogue. It was actually painful to watch the actors have to say these lines. If there were an award for the worst dialogue ever written for a movie in the history of movie-making, I suspect this would win. I can't imagine why this movie was even made.
B00A83075M|5.0|Very funny and I laugh at this movie, think it will be a classic like many of Disney's movies. Fantastic.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was so happy to find  Season 3 of Downton Abbey on Amazon.com.  It was terrific! Good reception and easy to order.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really really love this app but when it doesn't load or says pinterest is not responding or does a force close on my fire its kinds annoying....it goes way faster on my computer but I still love pinterest!!! &lt;333333
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have tons of information that I need to access at the drop of a hat, and evermore does the job! A simple, easy to use layout with all the functions I need make it one  of my fav apps
B007EC27QM|5.0|I really enjoy using the app for its simplicity. I like that it gives you the history of what you have done. I also like the ability that you can swipe your finger across the top row of keys to change them. I would,however, like to see the keys changing into financial keys.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|I read the book which was very good. I like this version not as well, but found it to be acceptable.  The acting was somewhat stiff; however, the scenes and costumes were impressive.
0596007124|5.0|I recommend all Head First books to my students - this book is just as awesome as all the Head First books out there - the humor is great - the code is excellent - you create a whole project as you go along in the chapters - and you learn more than you would in a conventional textbook - guaranteed!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have a kindle fire hd and I read the reviews for this app and I have to disagree! This app does NOT drain my battery. And it actually comes in handy, if I am in the middle of a game or book and my battery is low it gives several warnings before shutting down. Without the app I would receive a few low battery flashes then my kindle would just shut off. This app also shows exactly how much battery life there is, example 8hours of internet, 6hours of music, etc. All and all it is definitely a good app to have. And it is FREE!!!! All I can say is that I love this app and I think that you should try it yourself and decide.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|- This is one of those flicks that you can watch over and over again and never get bored of it. I considered it a master piece. Thanks amazon but giving it to me so cheap.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I loved this movie, the stry and. How it was done. I will watch it over and over no doubt.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|- I saw this movie on theater and for me is without any doubt a great movie. A real grownups love story. Great price by Amazon. I hoped the could relaunch it on blue-ray
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game no problems for me. I recommend to anyone. All of the different settings are awesome. Nuff said.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|As a former horse owner I'd say it's a pretty accurate depiction of what it's like. Great app for kids.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing. I can't think k of anything else to say about it! 'Amazing' sums it up in one word!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book as much as the others! I don't get y people give it one star over the narrator just READ the book!!!!!!
0345529057|5.0|Books were in perfect condition. I would recommend this book series to anyone who loves a little scandel and an overall creative storyline.
B0091TGWYE|3.0|Ordered, then read reviews. Not what I wanted. Think it would get dirty, and I don't like a phone without a case, so when I got this, I didn't even open it. Did not look like it would even fit my phone. Since I didn't take it out of the package, I cannot really comment on how it works; I am going on others reviews!
B008D36INE|1.0|I was surprised by the overt (in a bad way) melodrama and theatrical emotion, which fell really flat. If this film aspired to high tragic romance, something like _In the Mood for Love_, it fails. Weisz is too self-aware of the camera, like models are. They see themselves only through the camera as the camera sees them. They can't see themselves, much less their characters. The music only compounded the wince-to-watch acting and screenplay.
0618918248|5.0|I have recently deconverted to atheism and I asked atheists alot of questions and several times I was refered to this book. Dawkins does a great job in presenting the logical flaws of faith without peer-reviewed scientific evidence, and teaches that doubt is healthy, reasonable and logical. This book has really helped my transition go much smoother. He is also a good writer and not boring at all.
0684803356|5.0|What could be better than Hemmingway?  More Hemmingway.<br /><br />I learned about this short epilogue on the program \\"Hemmingway in Cuba\\" was broadcast April 6, 2013 on my local pbs station.  There is a joint effort by Cuban and American scholars to preserve all the materials left at his home in Cuba.  I am not a scholar, but want to share this with other readers of Hemmingway.<br /><br />This Epilogue for \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" was found in the basement of Finca Vigia.<br /><br />Epilogue<br /><br />It was night when Golz rode in a staff car on the road down from the pass to El Escorial.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Definitely a well done job in translating the characters from the book to this series.  Well done!  I've since been able to purchase the rest of season 1 and season 2.  Great series !!
B006Y9BVRM|4.0|My last Seiko lasted 10yrs and cheap battery vendor didn't seal properly, so...searched for new watch and bought this one after reading reviews + liked the look.<br /><br />The watch looks sharp. I have no reservations about wearing with a suit.  Size, weight and boldness of numbers on dial took a little getting used to, but in the end I'm very happy with this purchase. Nice value for a quality piece, have received a lot of compliments.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is super fun u can get characters and boards coins and extra<br /><br /> This game is addicting to me my own opion
B0088TG252|5.0|A great story. Makes me even more cynical than I already am. Believable in that the authors were not afraid to allow main characters to reach not so good endings. A page turner from the get go. I enjoyed it very much.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|It is a really good game on the market. I started the game over just to play from scratch again.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|This movie was awesome to watch. I was very disappointed at the very end when the whole point of the movie was made. I wont spoil it, but I'm not the only one who was disappointed.
B00942S4OY|5.0|loved this album as well, can't wait for new music form them. Loved to hear lots more. lots of favorite songs
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I have had problems with my Kindle Fire cables becoming lose and eventually not charging my Kindle Fire.  So far this one is working perfectly!  I am very happy, but remain cautiously optimistic.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|love this band. can't wait for more music form them. love all the songs on this cd. other teens will love them toooo
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|This game is pretty fun.  It's marketed as a free game and so far they haven't made it so that you HAVE to pay.  I like that you don't have to wait for energy to fill up like most other games of format.  The only problem I have with the game is trying to use their social interface.  Facebook works fine but I don't want anyone to know that I play these little games because then I get bombarded with requests for every crappy game that's out there.  The Gameloft social interface doesn't work on my kindle fire hd 8.9 nor do the updates.  Other than it being a lonely single player game, it's pretty decent.<br /><br />I gave it 5* because it's fun and playable for hours or minutes.  No need to hover all day hoping you don't get attacked(cough backyard monsters cough).
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE IT. VERY INTERESTING GAME. I AM A &cent;certified Cena hater.But I gotta admit he's gonna win tonight against the Rock in Wrestlemania.R U Ready 4. The Mania. I KNOW I AM
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Having 3 children of my own, my heart goes out to Jaycee & her family for all that shes been through.  That being said...it appears that Jaycee has taken charge of her life by writing this book!
B004TTMYQG|5.0|i particularly love that it will display TEXT for every item, even in Month view.<br /><br />[And more words so the review will publish]
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This was a great action & suspense filled movie....we loved the chase scenes, 007 better watch out, this movie was fantastic!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This is my every day alarm clock now, I love the mechanism of making you do simple math problems to kill the alarm - keeps me out of trouble big time!<br /><br />Very reliable and good to use.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Finished in one day.  That Abby is a lucky girl. I totally fell for Travis. This would make a great movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors. When I noticed this new release in Kindle format, I just bought it. Read it in two days. Really difficult to lay aside once you start reading.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I can't figure out how to play this game but my 3 year old grandson had it figured out right away.<br />He loves it .....maybe it's just not meant for adults so I'm giving it 4 stars for my grandson Marek.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it great that subway surfers is going world tour that's awesome i play even more often now 5 stars for world tour
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game u get addicted to it like everyday I have played this game ever since I got the app just like fashion story and bakery story my id on both fashion and bakery story is lyriklove16
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I've always viewed a lot of purported addictions as nothing more than bad habits and the author, in essence, brings that to light in his book, indicating that there are cues and rewards with every habit.<br /><br />For instance, a cue might be coming home from a hard day of work and the reward might be relaxation.  How the feeling of relaxation is achieved might be through alcohol, exercise or buying something and, over time, the mechanism selected, eventually becomes habitual.  Thus, one might eventually find he or she must have a beer after work in order to get the relaxed feeling.  Then, one day, one beer is not enough to make you feel rewarded/relaxed, so it goes to two, then three, etc., and then you've become a boozehound.  Or a shopaholic.  Or a compulsive gambler.<br /><br />Since much of what humans do is guided by habits both good and bad, Duhigg argues that one must consciously recognize the cue-reward cycle and substitute a good/healthy habit for a bad/unhealthy habit.<br /><br />The book has already helped me mend a bad habit or two.  Granted, it's not an easy path but, as they say, knowing is half the battle.  A worthy read that might increase your understanding of why you do what you do and what you can do to make positive changes.  Highly recommended.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game it kept me interested loved all the mini games and how each location led to another its definitely worth paying for best game Ive ever had on my phone : )
B007REV4YI|2.0|Slow, predictable and uninteresting storyline.  Opening sequence is fast paced with jaw dropping action (as expected) then the dullness takes it from there (not expected).  The villain, played by Javier Bardem, presents a caricature of a true Bond villain.  Big budget production with a small payout for those who sit through the whole screening.  Thin Bond gruel, indeed.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Among all the other good things people have mentioned, I think the movie does a great job of depicting how politics work.  It's a dirty job and I imagine it's much worse now than it was during Lincoln's time.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is awesome you should SO get it but the only thing is some of the characters are ridiculously priced for coins how would you ever get snuff coins? Overall this app is awesome epic and more
B000JMKNV0|5.0|This must be the very first time that I saw a movie, and afterwards read the book, and it was portrayed  EXACTLY like the book.  It's almost as if the book was the script for the movie.  It is absolutely amazing how an author such as Dennis can build these characters with plays on words, have a story inside a story, and have the reader follow it, understand it, and get lost in the intricacies of it.  Very well done!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is very easy to learn, fun game play.  some challenges are just that challenges, take time to complete them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game.  I always liked playing it in the casinos now I can play it anywhere!  Thank you for sharing this.
B00006EXDM|5.0|I love this CD and remember all the tunes from the 60's and early 70's. Real classic Rolling Stones music.
0736092269|5.0|This is a good book as it shows you in detail which muscle groups are getting used main and secondary .
B000PD3LIA|5.0|Unique style but i loved it. I listen every time on the road. All the instruments are really successful. Thanks
0385349947|5.0|This book helps everyone.  It shows women how they hold themselves back without even knowing it.  Ms. Sandberg shares hard data to illustrate her points as well as personal anecdotes and stories from the multitude of women she has met along her journey.  Everyone should read this book.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Had problems with freezing and not loading properly on my fire kindle HD with the free lite version but haven't had those issues since buying the full version.  Having flown Cessnas I can tell you that the controls have a realistic feel especially in simulation mode which is probably why some feel that it's too difficult.  Really it just takes finesse and practice.  Nothing beats a three point landing on a carrier!  Definitely a fun game and worth the 2.99 for me.
B000OVLIQU|4.0|I found Geoff Emerick's book an interesting read. A great peek behind the scenes.<br />Geoff greatly admires Paul McCartney, is weary of John Lennon and dismisses George Harrison and Ringo Starr as second rate<br />musicians.<br />Who knows ...<br />The best part of the book is the song by song breakdown as to how the songs were recorded, overdubbed, and produced for the<br />final release.<br />All Beatles fans should give it a look.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just finished the second book and can't wait to start the third.  These books are almost addictive.  They are truly excellent reads.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|It's a story that inspires spirituality, humility and wonderment. I especially loved the bonding between the main character and Richard Parker the Bengal tiger who came to appear more as a human in his behavior and mannerisms. The film shows more or less how we humans are more like animals then we realize and how animals are more or less like us. The only difference is that God wished us to rule over them. It's a really heartfelt and sweet film.
B007A6XLDU|3.0|Amazon AppSotre 2.0.17<br />Google Play 2.1.4<br /><br />In this version i cannot get Dropbox to work.  Support ask me to update the product. But Amazon product is one year old. (the google version dates from february 2013.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I read the series because my daughter suggested it.  I usually get a little bored with teen reads but Lauren Oliver once again delivered a quality story.  I look forward to more of her books.
B001N3EZW2|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  Viewers should pay particular attention to the sound effects in the movies.  These were done before computer sound effects of the newer movies.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie kept us in the edge of our seats. This is Ben Affleck's definite come back movie. Highly recommended.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is another great, mind-bending book. I love how Stephen King makes me think about things.  He always gives me s new way to view common thoughts; this book gave me a new perspective on \\"what if\\".  it's a great work of fiction, but based on facts.
0765325950|5.0|it had to come to an end, all the for telling came true, i will read it again soon more slowly and then start again book one
B001NOQI3U|5.0|I put this movie on as background to my passover fried matzoh party, and loved watching it while serving jew food. The last movie we watched was Diane Vreeland, who discovered her... Love Babs!
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I was wondering if I should buy this DVD or not based on the rating that movie critics labeled it with.  So my husband and I watched it on pay per view first before deciding to buy it.  We have watch it over and over again.  Every surfer should have this DVD in their library.<br /><br />I have since learned that critics labeled this movie a flop because it does not have sex, swearing and violence compared to the movies that is common today that is loaded with filth.<br /><br />Kudos to the producer of this movie.. there is still some decency left in movie production.  Is it perfect? No there are some scene there that is obviously shoot at an Aquarium but hey...it it still good.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|fun and addicting little game, and a lot more challenging than expected.... it also has very peaceful, melodic music playing to... very cool.

B003O86FMW|5.0|A great sequel to The Hunger Games.  I wanted to keep up with what would happen next and was not disappointed!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked this book a lot  - it was a fun read that makes you think a lot who you hate more - him or her!  I thought there was so much thought out about this book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hooked immediately and knew I would be reading all three of the Hunger Game books.  I read it on the recommendation of my teen-aged grandson and honestly did not think it would be a book I would enjoy - I was very surprised that I liked it so much and that it would raise so many thoughts and questions about my values and beliefs.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I think that you need to actually have to find the item that you are going in the room to look for and if you need to have energy to enter a room you should be able to use you coin
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A book I couldn't put down!  I found it believable and thought-provoking, filled with emotion.  I was encouraged to read the Hunger Game books by my teen-age grandson and I'm glad I did!  I would recommend this trilogy to anyone!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I really enjoyed this Sherlock what happened to the other one I like movies that make you think. Get more
B0026SFEW8|5.0|Grease came out at the movies when I was a kid in high school.  It was so fun back then and this movie brings back memories of my high school days.  I had not seen this in years and it was nice to watch it again on Amazon Prime.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Yes about time that you had this available to rent I have been looking for i for a while, thanks
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I didn't get turned on to the Downton Abbey program until this year when the 3rd season started.  I found the first and second seasons on Amazon Prime and I was hooked.  I was telling my mom and best friend about this and neither of them have Amazon Prime.  I ordered this DVD set for my mom and she had hours of entertainment from them. Not only did she watch them, she shared them with her sisters (my aunts) who are now hooked on the program as well.  It's been a long time since we all have been hooked on the same program (probably the original Dallas).<br /><br />Come on Season 4...
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I am a big Lord of the rings fan. I read the books, as well as the Hobbit, and I have the movies.  This movie is not a Lored of the Rings but it is good.  I love fanstasy and science fiction movies.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It's a book that makes you laugh. It's funny. And sliding is quirky. Continue the series. A lot of people can relate I assume
0060245867|5.0|I like this author and this series.  I now have several of the books and my grandchildren aged 3 & 4 yrs -old love them.  The book was in good condition.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book was instrumental in assisting me with the Awakening process.  More than anything it assisted me in getting out of the mind and body identified state and into an understanding of the truth regarding who I really am.  Huge fan of Eckhart Tolle and recommend anything he's written.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game is fun, but you have to use real money to pay for certain things. That's bogus!!! I can understand a few things, but not a lot...... And $99.99 for a mountain of bits?!?!? No thank you!
B001VEI7V8|5.0|If you are looking for a step by step introduction to the world of personal development and wealth creation, this is it!  I've invested a lot of time in this book, over the last five years.  It goes with me wherever I go.
B00BGGIW2K|4.0|Brief album review: Great tunes, excellent arrangements (mostly sparse, but never empty or boring). A striking sound these two talented guys produce, and very consistently and effortlessly so.<br /><br />Vinyl: Is Woman worth owning on vinyl? In a word - Yes. But, if you're an audiophile looking for a little bit more detail, read on.<br /><br />The mids and highs are very strong on the vinyl version, and though the lows are certainly present and punchy, they are not quite as full as I'd hoped. Also, there is a noticeable amount of hissing on the \\"s\\" sounds, which definitely takes away from the atmospheric vibe of the songs. From where I'm sitting - this is a very well-produced album, and a 180-gram reissue would do this release better justice. (Maybe even white vinyl, too??) It certainly deserves even more than the standard vinyl treatment, in my opinion.<br /><br />It seems to be pretty clear that the bit rate used to make these pressings is higher than 16 bit digital for the CD, and that in and of itself is worth the money. So, don't be afraid to choose the vinyl format for this great album. It sounds like a different album on vinyl (in a good way), and I highly recommend listening to it this way.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This Book Opens Doors!  For those who are going through the awakening process and have read other books but still feel like there's something missing, the information in this book provided that &#34;missing element&#34; for me.  It's simplicity was most welcome.  I believe that this book is a great fit for anyone, at any level, of the Awakening.  From entry level on up I do not believe that anyone would be disappointed with this book.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is fun and additive. Simple to play, yet hard to let go. Most of the time is spent accumulating coinage, just to upgrade. Then the cycle starts all over.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A novel that keeps you quessing to the very end. Well written with full character development. Want to read more by this author.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the feature it has  someone reading the Bible as well.  Great idea, if someone has a problem reading they can listen to it.

0060825456|3.0|This is the fifth collaboration between Neil Gaiman an Phillip C. Russell. It is about a young girl, who likes to explore everything new and so she finds a door to an other world, where there's her another mother, who want her to stay and be a lovely daughter. I am from Germany and we just have read the book \\"Coraline\\" at my school. I think that it would be a great book for younger people to read it, because for them it would be a nice entertainment. For young children Coraline is a brave hero, who discovers a scary world. But for learning English it would also be useful to read the comic for older children because of the fitting vocabulary. P. C. Russell is very talented and the pictures are really great and so it is funnier to learn vocabulary and it isn't like an exercise to understand English texts, but you learn. Although I didn't really liked the book, because I don't like fantasy books and apart from the vocabulary it was easy to read it. For me it seems to be the perfect bedtime story and not nice graphic novel for teenagers.

1583334386|5.0|Well written, very well written to convey the message......  One of the best books I've read, across the boards, not just for self-help section......  The author really knows how to make the audience/reader understand what she was trying to say......  An incredible knowledge and hard-to-believe facts of how our brain works.....  Just a great, great book!!!
B001EAWMGA|5.0|The disc was in great shape and works very well. Case had minor damage on it and there was writing on the disc, other then that I am very please with this product.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|I read this sequel to Ken Follet's Pillars of the Earth with concern that it could not be as good; my fear was completely unfounded and it is a thrilling epic just as good as Pillars! I love the way he weaves the story line so that you never had time to get bored.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Solid solid solid!  Having not read a novel on my Kindle, what a great title to begin with, thanks for the read!!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Excellent sequel to Fall of the Giants. Ken Follet threaded the 2 books and weaving story line with beauty and skill. Never tireed of the story. As a person who had never really known much about the politics of the time I found the historical backdrop fascinating and informative.

B00992CF6W|5.0|My daughter plays this game and loves the creative modes to build worlds and likes knowing the different &#34;laws&#34; that go with each type of block
B004AYCWZI|3.0|I'm giving this three stars for it's wonderful settings and characters.  They do make it worth the brief read.  Unfortunately, there is so little plot, and so little dimension to what plot there is, it becomes less than its more interesting ingredients, and somewhat boring. A little bit of dramatic tension would have taken this book to the next level.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Game play is simple, but fun. It's good for a free app. Would like to find something more complex like Fable for Xbox, but it's not bad for a tablet game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book. I think everyone should read this book. With more action and drama than the other books this is the best of the trilogy
B00992CF6W|5.0|it's the best game to play when your board I know it's not like the computer or XBox  but it's getting these pretty soon it will be like the $6 minecraft  so I recommend you get this game.

B001NKI60W|5.0|Yes, it was campy.  No, Pierce Brosnan is not the best singer in the world.  But, what absolute fun!  And Meryl Streep - well I could listen to her over and over (oh, yes I did!)  I loved the interaction of all the characters and even though his singing was not great, I loved Brosnan as Sam.  The whole cast was a delight.  Will I watch this again - you bet!
B006LSZECO|5.0|this is a stunning book - Ms. Flynn has twists within twists & keeps you guessing all the way through - wonderful book
B003VANOFY|3.0|This was my first gaming headset. It said that it was like new, everything included just not the box. When it got here it was missing the disk which comes with the headset that explains how to set it up and use it. Its been a while and I still do not understand half of the options on the set. Very disappointing and not exactlty honest.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I got this when Google pulled the plug on its reader. I now wish it did so sooner or at least that I found Feedly sooner. The layout is perfect and it picked up my Google feeds seamlessly. All I had to do was link accounts and then relax and read Feedly. No fuss, no muss, no time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great stress reliever. Fun. Not too challenging, but rewarding. Clever and colorful. Thanks for sharing it.<br />Cute theme.just needs a good stand with caramel apples
B005OZ4EVW|3.0|Her style of the 90s was excellent.  Cuando puedas was blasphemous which is a turnoff. I think she could come back.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love all the Castle episodes. The chemistry between the actors is fantastic and every show is exciting and can stand alone. You don't have to see every episode to follow the series, but I wouldn't miss one!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Much more detailed than the movie. I'm sure I will read it again.I highly recommend it to all types of readers.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Love this movie, so entertaining. The martians are hysterical. Lots of famous actors really camping it up and having fun with their characters. I laughed many times and not a moment or scene of boredom.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fantastic entertainment with history weaved into the stories. I have not seen a series this good in years! Addictive in a good way.
B00005UW7V|5.0|This is a highly disturbing and brilliant movie, a masterpiece. The storyline is broken into 3 sections. It shows us how cold, robotic and unemotional humans can be, serving only their own desires. It's about love and about humanity. The robot humans have more intelligence, survival instincts, common sense and compassion. Haley Joel Osment is absolutely outstandingly brilliant as the robot child and Jude Law is fabulous as Gigilo Joe. Each of the 3 sections of the movie creates deep emotional response. It causes us to question ourselves on many levels. When the credits roll, you find yourself in silence, crying, speechless, wondering 'What was that?'. This movie is a must see, and if you hate it or just don't get it, you need to seriously ask yourself what it is reflecting within yourself that upsets you so!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I found this book to move very slowly until the last quarter of the book. At several times i considered putting it down and not reading any further. I pushed through and enjoyed the end of the book. Really just not enough action for my taste.
1932100660|5.0|Absolutely adore this book. What you eat is what you are, inside and out. The author has travelled the world and studied in depth the results of diet on the body. Different cultures have different diets and therefore different health problems. For example, when compared to Western diets, Asian women have incredibly lower breast cancer stats due to eating little to no dairy. As soon as these women adopt a Western diet, breast cancer stats begin to climb. This book offers in depth, fascinating facts and info that will no doubt save lives. The author has of course encountered resistance by his prestigious and often corrupt peer group who have harassed him throughout his career. It is time the public know the truth and wake up. Health is a common sense alkaline diet, but this book really makes it clear as to why, also tells how the public is lied to and manipulated. I could not put this book down, highlighting info constantly. One of my most favourite books in the past few years. The story of a well educated man with intelligence, morals and ethics, qualities rare to find.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and challenging. it is good to the brain<br />I love this game and it is amazing fun yet hard
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I'm new to smart phones and this is my first higher grade game. The first thing is the graphics on this game are wicked. The game play is smooth and easy to control. Glu makes quality games.
B004HW7JH4|1.0|disc was damaged on receipt.............you do not have permission to use my name......one two three four five six seven eight
B005LAIIHG|5.0|When I saw this movie out at the theaters and read the synopsis I didn't want to even bother. How could a movie about a boy trapped on a life boat with a man eating tiger be that interesting? Well I took a chance and purchased it on DVD while it was on sale and I must say, this movie ROCKS!!!! It was nothing like I had imagined it to be. The story was touching and it is a visual masterpiece. Richard Parker(the tiger) was enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and Pi Patel(Suraj Sharma) was a remarkable character. Determined to live this boy fights the elements and finds the inner strength that we all possess. A great film for the entire family(though I was a little upset with the Zebra and Arangatang scene). Just goes to show, never judge a book by its cover. This movie is an amazing story and very entertaining!
B004H4XI5O|4.0|Good riding, well developed mild suspense in a very real pseudo drama of an unseen sub culture. Good story, interesting topic, lots of cool factoids about history, science and human nature.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Not sure if it was me but I could not figure out the game. I will not play it again
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It has such a great story to begin with! I haven't gotten too far yet but this is a great game. The only thing I don't like is how fast your energy is used up:(
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is a bit of a different game for me. It makes you think, you know, use your brain a bit.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am only about half way through, but WOW!  Very hard to put down, just like books 1 & 2.  Would highly recommend this trilogy.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Bang Bangkok Bangor hey this game is so fun. Everyone should get it. I hope it's a pleasure to everyone
B009NQKXYK|2.0|This movie leaves most viewers wondering where the whole tale was going in the first place. It's ending is very not worth the wait.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have not really used this item much. I just got it, I have it full of my camera, lens, memory cards, and an older camera. It is a bit heavier than I'd expected, but then I have more stuff in it than my old shoulder camera bag. I will update my review after I've used this more. But so far I'm loving how everything fits in it, and how easy it is to just grab and go, knowing I have everything. It seems to be sturdy.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Item arrived safely and it works fine. Enjoy finding movies through your web site. I seem to find many things we can't find anywhere else.
B00C7L4QB4|2.0|After viewing the first episode of \\"Hannibal,\\" I wrote a review titled \\"More Questions than Answers.\\" That original review appears below. I've now bumped the show down from 3 stars to 2, and here's why.<br /><br />The show has descended from an adaptation of the Thomas Harris novels into a rip-off of them. It uses character names, plot elements, and assorted details from the novels, but otherwise departs from Harris's ideas in every significant way. Instead of extending and deepening Harris' characters, it trades off the audience's pre-existing fascination with them. Rather than tell a compelling story, the show has devolved into a hopelessly unrealistic, tediously prolonged meditation on gore, darkness, and dysfunction.<br /><br />Start, for example, with the title character. Why did Harris's Hannibal Lecter become such an icon in popular culture? Because the evil, psychopathic side of his character was paired with genuinely charming aspects: Old-World courtesy, a profound sense of humor, artistic and musical expressiveness. The Dr. Lecter of the novels and films was a real Nietzschean Ubermensch. He had a great zest for living. We wanted an invitation to his place for dinner--as long as we weren't on the menu. He was also, by the way, emotionally self-contained, and quite happy alone.<br /><br />Mads Mikkelsen is an outstanding actor, and if you like his version of Hannibal, so be it. But don't pretend that it has anything to do with the Harris character. The TV version is virtually without humor, dry rather than expressive, and displays no joie-de-vivre. This Hannibal is so emotionally needy that he has a psychiatrist (unthinkable in the novels), and tells her repeatedly how badly he wants to be Will Graham's friend (equally unthinkable). Obviously, the authors of the 5-star reviews find all that intriguing--but if the original Hannibal had been anything like Mikkelsen's, \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" would have flopped, and there would be no TV series in the first place.<br /><br />Similar considerations apply throughout this production.<br />- The other main characters are also darker, more dysfunctional, and less compelling than in the novels or films.<br />- The show portrays serial killers as two-a-penny, instead of the rarities they are. Instead of hunting one or two such monsters over the course of the season, which would have been both more realistic and more interesting, Will Graham has already dispatched half a dozen, and usually gets his man in a single episode.<br />- By mid-season, the crimes Will is supposed to be solving had already become mere background noise--a garnish of incidental gore--for the main soap opera plot, the tangled web between Graham, Lecter, Crawford, Bloom, Lounds, et al.<br />- The portrayal of the FBI's forensic operations is just plain stupid. The Tweedledee & Tweedledum technicians (who seem to be in charge of every area of forensic science simultaneously, like The Professor on \\"Gilligan's Island\\") may have been intended as comic relief; if so, they've failed.<br />- Finally, am I really the only viewer who is just plain tired of the relentlessly repetitive visual language? The 5-star reviewers must really, really like the standard setting: two people in a very dark room, usually back-lit by a single bright window, having a dark, tangled conversation in a near whisper. Such a mise-en-scene surely has its place, but when 3/4 of the entire show is composed that way, it gets more than a little tiresome.<br /><br />Usually, I can understand why people like movies and TV shows, even when they don't appeal to my personal taste. When it comes to \\"Hannibal,\\" I'm stumped.<br /><br />-------Original Review: \\"More Questions than Answers\\"----------<br /><br />My first impression, watching the pilot episode, was, \\"Really?\\" Television has depicted arrogant, anti-social detectives (e.g., Sherlock Holmes), sloppy hound-dogs (Columbo), hopeless neurotics (Monk), tough guys (Jim Rockford), senior citizens (Matlock) and everything in between. But all of them have somehow managed to be sympathetic characters. As was Will Graham in the novel, \\"Red Dragon,\\" and in both of its big-screen adaptations. And, while we're at it, so was Hannibal Lecter, in his own creepy way--through four novels and five films.<br /><br />Now we have a TV series that seems designed to make both of these characters as unsympathetic (to the audience) as possible. Also, by the way, Laurence Fishbourne's Jack Crawford so far seems less the deep-thinking, insightful crook-catcher of the novels, and more a mere government bureaucrat.<br /><br />Question: With characters like this, do they really expect us to watch a whole season of the show?<br /><br />The overall plotting of the series also raises questions. We know that Will Graham eventually catches Dr. Lecter. (Whereas, on \\"The Mentalist,\\" we don't know if Patrick Jane will ever catch Red John--although if he hasn't done so by the end of this season, I'm done watching.)<br /><br />Question: How long can a show like this stretch out the Graham/Lecter relationship? If the denouement comes relatively soon, then the show is over. If it takes 5 seasons, then Will Graham loses his believability as a detective: he's got a serial killer right under his nose, and can't sniff him out.<br /><br />Finally, I'm sorry to say that the attempt to create something truly new and original here fails (so far). Recent shows like \\"Monk,\\" \\"The Closer,\\" and \\"The Mentalist\\" have demonstrated that it IS possible to do things in the TV detective genre that are truly fresh and interesting. But that's not happening here. The whole show looks a bit cut-and-paste: for example, Will Graham exercises his imagination in fantasy flashbacks that look like \\"CSI\\"-meets-\\"Twin Peaks.\\"<br /><br />I'm not ready to write off the show just yet. There's clearly a great deal of acting talent here, and the writing is decent+. I'll give it 13 episodes to see if it can answer the questions I've raised. But the producers will really have to pull a rabbit out of a hat to get to Season 2. (Hopefully, a live rabbit, with all its fur intact, no vampire fangs, etc.)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|It is a beautiful recording of fantastic music!  Well done! Just like being at the theater. We loved it! Play it a lot.
B000002OX7|5.0|I'm glad that I finally bought this album, and proves how stupid I was for not buying it years ago! I guess the positive thing was that I was able to by the CD cheap and great conditions. If you like the Who, you need this album!
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|Took awhile of reading to get hooked. This story just seemed a bit far-fetched like there was no flow for quite awhile.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|I have never read the books so my review is only of the movie. I liked the concept of it,and the characters. If you like scifi take a peek. You can watch old trailers on You Tube to see if you are interested.
B005K17RU0|5.0|it's awesome I use all the time to plan out my day. it has more detail that makes it reliable
B000O8OTNC|1.0|I had this not more than two hours before the taper came off. The plastic is really weak and gave to it--couldn't even screw it back in place. This is only worth it if you never ever actually need to sharpen anything…just for looks.
0374532125|5.0|In `Dead Aid', the author, Dambisa Moyo, a former consultant at the World Bank, dispels the archaic political and social beliefs surrounding the effectiveness of African aid programs. Often regarded as taboo within the international economic community, corruption and the gross misappropriation of billions of dollars in aid by African governments have led many to question whether aid should continue.  In the book, Moyo provides an expert analysis of an economic and developmental quagmire created from a cultural dependency on aid, and offers in depth solutions to mitigate and ultimately overcome decades of regression.<br /><br />Moyo boldly asserts that rather than relying on aid--an economic nostrum which has failed to produce any sustainable development and has only helped to foster corrupt bureaucracy--African nations should instead seek foreign direct investment (FDI). Among the many solutions offered, Moyo advocates for the utilization of alternative efforts such as the Grameen Bank model, an award winning microfinance organization which makes small loans to the impoverished without requiring collateral, as a potential vehicle to overcoming some of Africa's many obstacles to economic development.<br /><br />As an outsider with the purview of most Americans, I believe that if implemented the ideas in this book could produce many positive ramifications for the African contintent.  However, until they are implemented in Africa on a suitable scale and found to be efficacious and sustainable, they remain just ideas.
B0063IH60K|4.0|App runs great but the constant ads are really annoying. Should have read other reviews before I downloaded. The game itself is really great though.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|On of the best book series I've ever read. This last book in particular was astounding, amazing and so well written. I hope the rest of the movies can live up to it.

B009O07NMA|5.0|I bought this album the minute I heard &#34;Cruise&#34;  I am obsessed with this album.  It's in my truck stereo non-stop, and even my kids sing &#34;shine&#34; whenever it comes on.

B005FRF6PC|5.0|If Rafa is one of your favorite tennis pros, this is a must read to get insight to one amazing young man. The quiet unassuming impression he gives in his interviews is real and the book shows more dimensions to the man, then what you see on the court.
0525952926|5.0|This is a great read.  I love trilogies and this is no exception.  I can't wait to read the last one.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This backpack is good, it could be better.  It holds all what I need it to in terms of the main camera and the typical accessories (chargers, wires, backup batteries, backup memory cards).  The only reason I rated it a 4 was because it doesn't have a real nice way to hold a basic (non-pro) tripod that is collapse-able. I rigged it so the side straps could hold mine but it could be better incorporated.  The bungee strapping on the outside front is too loose on the one I received so it doesn't get much use at all.  I tried to put the tripod there but it was too loosy goosy for my taste.  The inside panels are configurable to what every need you have for what you will store in there. There are only two hold down velcro straps for the inside, I with there were at least 4.  All in all I am happy with this and would recommend it.
B007T967X4|5.0|I love this app and it works great on kindle fire. I would definitely recommend it for anyone just learning notes.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very cute and funny family movie. Really enjoyed the combination of child and adult humor. Highly recommend watching with a bowl of popcorn.
1596912863|3.0|This book immediately grabbed my attention with Hale's flawless blend of modern-day humor and Austen-esque wit. The problem I found with the book was the ending. [spoiler alert] The main character's whole motive in going to Austenland is to rid herself of her unrealistic \\"happily ever after\\" approach to men. But the character unfortunately ends up in a relationship MORE outlandish and doomed to failure than any of her previous relationships. Readers really need more in order for them to believe that Jane has truly found her \\"happily ever after\\" and not yet another heartbreak waiting to happen. Too many questions are left unanswered for this to be a plausible, happy ending. Something an Austen book would never make the reader feel. That said, I would recommend it as a good, clean romance, and for the wit alone.
1401235425|5.0|This by far is one of my Favorite Comic Books i have ever read. It has a well told story with amazing art work. I used to read more of Marvel than Dc Comics But after this read i have started to switch. I have went from Spider man and Wolverine to Batman Wonder woman and Superman. I seriously recommend this to All comic book fans. Buy it. It is worth the painful wait. :)
B005MMJ84K|5.0|wasn't crazy about the now/then style, but i loved the content.  really good writer.  love the way she describes things.  lots if wonderful lines.  good non-stupid plot and characters.  i can't wait ti read the last one and yet already sad because ut us the last

B00BGIC4I6|1.0|Poor script, poorly edited.  I wanted to like it.  At 90 minutes, it might have been okay.  At this length, two plus hours, it was a slog.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Usually I find when I have read a book or series of books, the movie or television show that follows is disappointing. This series is interesting from the first episode. Obviously with books as long as these are, some things have to be cut out and other things changed, but overall I would say it stays pretty true in Season 1. The acting is excellent as well as the costumes and scenery. Looking forward to Season 2.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If I am not the biggest Fringe fan in the universe, I am close to it.  I still cannot believe Fox cancelled the show.  But thanks to Amazon, I can still get my Fringe-fix.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Silver Linings Playbook.  It's pretty hard not to like this movie.  The story moved, there were plenty of jokes, and the script was really good.  But the best thing about it was the casting.  Excellent acting by all involved.  Jennifer Lawrence does deserve her Oscar for this. You can't help but to love her character. I did find it a little choppy on the editing, but that was only to keep it from being a longer movie.  I also don't know if this is a movie I'd see over and over.  When it comes out on video, there will be parts I fast-forward through because of intense emotional drama of some scenes. Overall, the lightheartedness of it and the awesome script makes it a go see. I had a good time 3.9/5 stars.  (Excelsior!)  ~Keep On
B0093LINVK|5.0|I bought this two months ago and it has been working without problems since then. I use it primarily as a home theater PC (HTPC), and have not encountered any issues watching DVDs or viewing other media from the web or the external USB drive. Attach a webcam to your HTPC setup, and you've got yourself instant videoconferencing. It also works great as a replacement for a desktop.<br /><br />Installing the latest version of Linux Mint was a snap!<br /><br />When it comes time to replace my current desktop, I'll definitely be back to see what's the latest with the Intel NUC.
1606865617|4.0|The prose in this book in my opinion is flawless, detailed and gripping.  The characters are very much alive and it touches on a lot of themes that are relative to India and the struggles that the people go through.  The author has a distinct style of writing that stands out amongst most other fiction and is often poetic in nature.  Worth the read!
B004EJUMT2|5.0|The moment I heard Ghost (or Ghost B.C. in the US) on Spotify, I thought the metal station made a mistake. There was no way something like this was playing with all of the mundane crap that labeled \\"popular metal.\\" My ears were not deceived. Ghost is a wonderful...goddamned wonderful Metal band from Sweden. In fact, as much as I love the almighty Opeth, I put their latest \\"Heritage\\" down to listen to Opus Eponymous more.  Each track is like an ode to how metal used to sound like. The only drawback that I would claim is that the lyrics are VERY Satanic....but who cares!? Well, Catholics, maybe. Regardless, ignore them if you find them offensive. Beautiful vocals, not too complicated and awesome guitar riffs and drum rhythms make this album hold its own. Bands like this make be very envious of the Swedes.<br /><br />And to think, this sound is just icing on the cake. Watch this band live and the theatrics take over. If you are a fan heavy rock or metal from the 70s, BUY THIS ALBUM NOW. I'm anticipating the next album. So far it's darker, but pretty damn good too. It might rival this one.

B009GEAPYW|4.0|Entertaining and seemed to follow the original comic to the best of my recollection (admittedly, it's been years since I'd read it).  Not as &#34;dark&#34; as I remember though; the graphic novel I remember as a kid was much more violent.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app. I like the new update cuz I can check for fishing weather!!!!! and it has other neat stuff.
B002I9Z8B2|4.0|I bought this bluray , to watch this film as good as it can get . Im disappinted that the \\"extended cut \\" wasnt included , but many scenes were much clearer an when Kirk spoke to Khan over the viewscreen , before it was grainy an fuzzy , in this verison, its looks much better . As one of the many ppl who saw this film in the movies , theres a scene on the bridge thats been cut on every VHS,DVD . Its when kirk allows Savick to sit in the captains chair, and \\"Bones' says\\" are you going let a woman take us out ?\\",if you notice theres a quick edit that where they removed that sexist sentance. If your a fan you notice that edit . I alway watch this movie on my birthday , \\"This a classic Trek movie \\"
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I started my Angry Birds experience with Angry Birds Space and I loved it. Dotted angles show your potential trajectory, the &#34;worlds&#34; are interesting and the ads are minimal. This game is wayyyy too simplistic, scenes are boring and the advertising is horriblely distracting. The only interesting pieces are the power-up things and some of the birds have different powers than in angry birds space. I will be removing it.
0525953728|5.0|I loved this book.  It was riveting.  I read it in two days.  The way the story was told without revealing exact special ops methods was great!  Every American Patriot should read it!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was really fun, it's really easy to understand what you need to do. My little four year old cousin really loves this game.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn books are always thrilling with lots of action and political drama, and this one is exceptional.  The intrigue is addictive.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great series except fo the Christmas show.  What were they thinking?  Excellent cast.  Outstanding locale.  Superior writing.  There really is not enough postive thing to be said about it.  You can have great shows without graphic violence.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have this game on my android, but it's so much better on my kindle fire. It's a lot easier to maneuver, and I don't have the sane problems with lagging like the android version.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  Great cast (Maggie Smith is wonderful), wonderful locale, and superior writing.  It shows that good TV can be great without the violence and language.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This is a good hidden object game. There are a lot of different levels and objects to find. The story line is pretty good too. Sometimes a little too much dialogue.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I saw this in the theater with my grand children, enjoyed it then and now on our screen.  Great show, best of the three.
B000002MY3|5.0|I love it. I just wish that the words on Hand In My Pocket would rhyme.  A wonderful CD to listen to.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This was part of the grand children Easter baskets and they loved it.  Did have one egg break, but the movie was well reviewed but the ones that matter.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|This is truly a movie about good and evil and what selling your soul to the devil is really about.

B009FZHYKU|4.0|Rating just S3, Ep1<br /><br />Good season opener.<br />Lots of action, drama, suspense.<br />Michonne character will be good addition<br />Sad that world is so bad that a prison becomes a haven for them...
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I am having trouble with it closing when I try to open a book. Works for my PC, but not my tablet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought this book, then I almost didn't read it because I read about how many people hated the ending.  I didn't want to invest my time into a book that had a bad ending, or worse, no ending at all.  So, I reluctantly started reading it when my book club chose it.  Soon, I was enthralled.  And, I think the ending was perfect; I can't think of one that would be better.  Perhaps I enjoyed this book so much because I find psychopathy interesting.  I recently read Ronson's nonfiction book, The Psychopath Test, and this book was a great fictional follow-up.  Well-crafted, clever, insightful, compelling spine-tingler, this novel is original and definitely worth the time!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent read! The book was  hilarious and I am excited to see the actors portray the characters in the movie...Will definitely recommend to friends :-)
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Loved this book.  Easy and entertained to read.  Original, with lots of humor.  I did not want it too end!
0525478817|5.0|John Green's writing is amazing!  Although this book deals with a horrible subject there is humor as these two teenagers stare death in the face.  Are they mature beyond their years?  I would guess a cancer diagnosis ages you in many ways.  Hazel and Augustus are not your typical teenagers who worry about being popular, trendy clothes and school dances.  Cancer has taken much away from them but they still have spirit and give to each other good witty banter and much needed unconditional love.<br /><br />Peter Van Houten's appearances are amusing and random as you would assume from a somewhat washed out alcoholic author.<br /><br />Here's a little piece of the book.  A conversation between Hazel and Augustus.<br /><br />\\"There were days of pajamas and beard scruff, of mumblings and requests of him endlessly thanking everyone for all they were doing on his behalf.  One afternoon, he pointed vaguely toward a laundry basket in a corner of the room and asked me, \\"What's that?\\"<br />\\"That laundry basket?\\"<br />\\"No next to it.\\"<br />\\"I don't see anything next to it.\\"<br />\\"It's my last shred of dignity.  It's very small.\\"<br /><br />Read this book it's worth every moment!
B001NLKWLW|2.0|I found it complicated, a story too long for a final that was known from the begginning.  Difficult to believe.
B000I9W08I|5.0|My introduction to Michael Crawford who went on to be a great success.  The big production number is great. Recommended!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|This CD is a great product, it shipped fast, and was createted by a great guitar player / song wriiter
B004X4R49Y|5.0|This film definitely deserved to win the Oscar.  Colin Firth is phenominal as &#34;Bertie&#34;.  The freiendship forged between the king and a commoner was just amazing.  I would really recommend seeing this film.
B0009P66TK|4.0|This watch looks very nice. However, it is too thick and heavy for me. So I ad to send it back
B00A7GWG3Q|5.0|This is one of the most consistent albums Yo La Tengo has released in a while, going back to \\"I'm not afraid of you...\\"<br />Fade manages to achieve a laid-back sound overall, while still approaching the sonic distortions and noise that made me love Yo La Tengo in the first place! The first track, \\"Ohm,\\" features a catchy, poppy vocal melody backed by distorted guitars. It is a great start to a great album. If you're not careful, you might think you were transported back in time a few decades while listening to this album!<br />This is the same Yo La Tengo you have come to love, and this album features a consistent mood throughout, without any of the tracks going too far in any one direction.<br />Two thumbs up!
B00447L4KA|4.0|Kind of a version of Taming of the Shrew. Excellent performance by Heath Ledger, some pretty memorable scenes. I liked it.
B00AWFEBDK|2.0|Loved the earlier book, but the academic thesis quality and resulting repetitive quality of this one made it hard to continue.  Sections will appeal to individuals depending on their particular interests, but this one is not for reading from cover to cover in my opinion.
1451695195|4.0|Proof of Heaven is a unique NDE experience, moreso, written from a scientific medical perspective; the list of references was extensive and useful to anyone who wants to read more examples of NDE. My feeling is that Dr Eben Alexander is still grappling to understand what happened -- he is certainly a medical miracle. I would have liked more explanations from his medical team as how he survived and regained (I believe) most of his brain function.  An amazing account.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Not much more to say about this. It was brilliant when it was first released, and it's still brilliant now.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is by far the best rendition of the Cinderella story (Disney's version notwithstanding).  The writing is solid, the scenery gorgeous, and the cast spot on.  Anjelica Houston IS the evil step-mother.  No one else could have given such a gorgeous performance of the villainous bane of Cinderella's existence.  Speaking of the cinders girl, Drew Barrymore is stellar.  Not only does she maintain the decency and sweetness which is associated with the classical heroine, but she also gives a strength to Cinderella that we don't see anywhere else.  How many of us cheered when she punched Jacqueline over the bed for that mom comment?  Oh, yeah.<br /><br />The story brings together all the elements of the fairytale we all grew up with, as well as a few interesting surprises, such as a prince running away from his royal duties, gypsies, and Leonardo Da Vinci.  This is truly one of the best films ever.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Only game I have on this device.  I'm not exceptionally good at it, but I do enjoy challenges.  This game is next to my top fave: Tetris Blocks.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Yes, the boys are back!  I received my copy of this album today in the mail, and I've been listening to it all afternoon (as a matter of fact, I'm still listening to it as I write this!).  The more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it.  While \\"The Block\\" is still my favorite of their albums (and yes, I have every single one, including \\"New Kids on the Block,\\" their self-titled CD), \\"10\\" serves up plenty to love, including photos of the dreamy \\"five bad brothers from the Beantown land.\\"<br /><br />For one thing, Danny and Jon, who too often remain in the background, actually get some solo time on this album.  This, to me, makes this album the most well-balanced of all their other albums (with the possible exception of \\"Merry, Merry Christmas,\\" where Jon and Danny each carry an entire song).<br /><br />For another thing, relationships--from new and exciting to broken and painful--are really explored on this album.  That makes for great fun (and daydreaming!) for the die-hard female fans (myself included).<br /><br />And lastly, the harmonizing for which NKOTB is so well known is still present on this album (although \\"The Block\\" still offers some of their best).<br /><br />Whether you are a true Blockhead or just someone who enjoys good music, \\"10\\" delivers.  Buy your copy, slip it into the CD player, and let the five dreamiest fellas on the planet rock you \\"Back to Life.\\"
B001DM1VXE|2.0|This movie has interesting elements upon which to build a compelling story but the story was never written. As a 20 minute twilight zone episode this would have been compelling, interesting and thought provoking, but when stretched to 90 minutes it becomes painfully incomplete. There are many possible fascinating questions that could be explored. None of them are asked or answered. This movie was made from a screen play that was only 10% developed. There have been a lot of interpretations of the number of the beast. In this case it is 6 x 6 x 6 = 216. A 216 digit number translates to the name of God. How is this translation accomplished? What happens when a correct translation is completed? Why would Wall St traders know or care about it? The movie has some interesting elements but ends up being an incomplete and uninteresting mess of a film.

0307888908|3.0|Reid and Ben outlines a new world order where individuals must be more willing to move from job to job.  Loyalty to a single company is no longer necessary or warranted.  It's more important to focus on yourself and what opportunities bring you than to be chained to a single employer.  If a great opportunity comes, take it instead of staying at your current job.  THAT is the essence of this book.  Since employers are no longer loyal to their employees, employees should no longer be loyal to them.  It's a dog eat dog world.<br /><br />While this may be the new realities of life I find it a bit sad.  The book seems to suggest that the relationships you hold with the team at your job is not tied to the organization itself.  The authors think that there are no consequences to those relationships if you decide to depart for greener pastures.  I question the validity of that position.  I'm fairly certain that teammates don't take kindly to members leaving whenever it suits them. While the firm you left may not care, those co-workers may or may not feel that way.<br /><br />I'm sure the folks at Google are no longer so enthusiastic about Sheryl Sandberg.  Being nothing more than just a hired gun is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in America.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to agree that employment in America is increasingly operating in this new reality.  Most of the gen x and younger Americans no longer have long work histories at any one particular company.  It's a nomadic life of constantly on the look out for greener pastures.  While this may be a valid way to conduct a startup where you're constantly experimenting to see what works, I'm not so certain it's the way you should operate your life.  Many of the skills that people end up learning are nothing but superficial fluff made to look good on a resume.  How can you learn to become good at anything when you don't spend enough time at it?  In the old days, people work their entire lives at one particular skill so that they become experts.  These days, young people do it just long enough to become dangerous at it. It's all very superficial.<br /><br />The second half of the book relates to your network, how and why you must maintain your strong as well as weak connections, and cultivate new ones.  The authors suggest that you have to have quality as well as quantity.  The weak connections are sometimes the most helpful as they bring new insights and connections that's not in your social and professional circle.  They also are the likely connections that can find you a new position.<br /><br />Overall, the book paints a new world order that's not entirely positive. While reading it I got the nagging suspicion that the book wasn't all objective.  The authors clearly made a case for using their platform and made the outcome to suit their agenda.ll so that they become experts.

B003P2WO5E|4.0|I really do like Brandon Sanderson style of writing and the characters and ideas are truly exceptional. The only reason I didn't give this a love it rating was because I found it a bit confusing to read as the chapters kept switching not only between characters but between time periods which meant it didn't read as smoothly as his other books. Still on the whole another great book!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|The only thing I don't like about it is that it seems to be hard to get the light to be the brightest,  Overall good for free.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It grabbed me from the first minute which, for me, is the sign of a great book.  Although I loved it, I loved the first book better than the second, and even more than the third.  It all got a bit too much.  But it was a wonderful read and did me well for a week with a fractured knee injury.
1594744769|4.0|What a delightful little book. Lyrically written and original. The title and cover picture caught my eye and it only took a few pages to capture my imagination. A lovely interlude of suspended reality.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well I'm a mother of 4 kids and extremely busy. I bought the first book and had it in my drawer for months before I started reading. I made the mistake of starting it at 10pm one night. By 1am I had to force myself to put the book down and go to sleep. I completed the first book in a few days which is unbelievable for me. I had to buy the second and it is rare for me for a sequel to be better than the first, but boy was it. Of course I had to get the 3rd to complete it which was again, even better than the first two. The reason I believe this trilogy was so intriguing was because the writer is brilliant! She really knows how to write and capture your attention. If you want a good read, I highly recommend the whole trilogy. It will stick in your head for a good few weeks after. And if they pick the characters right, this could be an awesome movie.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderful read! I'm so glad that I grabbed this book. Now I'm on a mission to find all of her books.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Not a big fan of War movies as I used to be, not a big fan of Mainstream media, but how could I pass up on the final showdown between us and UBL. I hate talking politics and especially the middle east troubles, but again this is the final chapter of the tragedy of 9/11. The film stars a lot of actors I am not familiar with, except for the wheelchair guy in \\"OZ\\" and of course Mr. Soprano. I really like this movie, not a boring second in it. It took me back a few years in time when I was stuck in a small corner of the world called FOB Grizzly battling to keep my sanity.  It really hit home. A War film for the 21rst century and a darn good movie, check it out!<br /><br />MoPop
0765325950|1.0|pages 128 to 161 missing<br />I needed to buy another for a grandson.  He says it is the best book written in the series.
0425263908|1.0|Don't buy this book! If you have to read it check it out at the library. If I could give it a zero I would. This is a wannabe Shades of Grey, which isn't half as good. The book has no storyline, no development of characters, story doesn't go anywhere; it's just having CRUDE sex which I found a bit boring. This book was CRUDE and boring and possibly bordering on bad porn. Very disappointing. In the first chapters from day one Eva developed an obsession for Gideon, but she, herself had issues with be controlled or obsessed over by her mother and becomes obsessed over Gideon...Come on. Gideon having to take sleeping bills so he doesn't rape her...Please. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED! Did Sylvia read what she wrote?
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I watched with my 8 year old, after she'd finished reading the book, and we both really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The storyline differs from the book, but they did a great job of capturing the spirit of the movie. We watched the 'Featurettes' that you can watch for free on Amazon before watching the movie, and highly recommend doing this.  Hearing how they wrote the screenplay and seeing how they did the effects before watching the movie really helped bring it all to life.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I love this app!  I used to use Winamp, but I just couldn't get it to do what I wanted.<br />This app is easy to use and keeps a better stream coming through.  With Winamp, I could have 4 bars and still have buffering issues and no playback.  Xiia never has issues like this.<br />This app just does everything that I want it to.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Whether deliberately or not, the pop up ads start to show up a out a week after my 5 year old really started to care about her horse. Now, you cannot perform more than a chore or two (a few minutes) without getting one to two pop up ads for free games. It seems to be an unfortunate trend in these games to hook the kids and then get barrages of thee pop up ads. Inevitably, they will mistakenly, or by design, click to install a game. Just try to back out now. It is also just long enough to get some good reviews. Their FAQs blame the trend in games, but this is over the top. Shame on you NaturalMotion. Hopefully this trend is short lived and we do not become apathetic consumers. Wonder how kids get into real trouble in the internet, this is where it starts.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book until the last few chapters. It seems like a lot of thought was put into everything except the conclusion. After her return the story just literally plummeted off a cliff. I feel ripped off.
B00B23O96A|3.0|Clapton is always good in my opinion.  However, this is a mix of music that is a bit on the boring side to me. The songs don't have a good flow in my opinion.  I don't think there will be any top ten's on this album.  I wish Clapton would put out another blues album as they are my favorite.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this is a somewhat spoiler, but also a small note to the author - as if she'd actually see it.<br /><br />all the reviews i read about this book non of them gave the underline story line to to this book so when it came to light i was actually shocked and i to turned \\"numb\\" as Sky does - it was my way of coping too. yes, my dad is a total (insert BAD wordS). ive tried committing suicide back in 2006 (age  27) cause i just couldnt deal anymore cause of what happened after me. but my hubby wouldnt for some great reason leave me home alone that day. i went and seen a therapist who helped but enough for me to breath again and let me live, which i stopped the 3yrs before... when my first baby ,  daughter,  was born.<br /><br />for some reason about 1/4 through the book i was numb as if i was seeing the words just not feeling it which is odd cause its easy for me to get emotional over books. when the topic came to light i was totally cut off of all feeling, its how i coped when i was little too. but then i will never in my life forget that talk that Sky had with Hope. i cried so hard, a way noone will understand unless they had that kind of past, let alone from a dad. a dad who was a sunday school teacher.<br /><br />so Colleen, you will forever be a part of me, in my still healing/coping.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Awesome book......does highlight that humanity hasn't changed.  Still as violent as ever.  Violence driven by men who want to follow an ideology rather than think for themselves.  This will probably never change, unfortunately.
B00AFOS6P2|4.0|A departure from stuff like Dig Lazarus Dig, let love in and Murder Ballads. But that's Nick Cave.....constantly evolving, right?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|awesome u can get a higher score keep those updates coming! YOu came get keys like temple run to help with ur boars and your skill.

B000S0GYRU|5.0|In 1978, legendary Italian, Master of the Murder/Mystery and Horror Dario Argento Directed Suspiria. One of the most important movie in the history of movies (Since Les Frères Lumière invented the Medium) in my opinion. And it stands as one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />This one is surely one of the scariest and most disturbing movies i've ever seen. My favorite entry in the genre and probably my favorite movie period, all styles and genres involved. Although Argento's work has never been praised for the quality of his actors and scripts (It should never be), neither for his stories and plots (Stories made no sense and mostly in Suspiria. This one is also filled with plot holes.) But i honestly think no one should really care to understand an horror movie but  he/she should expect from it to be scary, gory or disturbing and nothing more.<br /><br />But the work of Argento himself and the effort he puts into making each scene his own, filming it and then editing it to render it in his own unique way, make this film maker a man apart from everyone else. You can name them all, but none of them can make horror movies and scenes as beautiful as Argento more than often did during his illustrous career, which didn't start with and didn't end with Suspiria. But this one in particular- The first of a trilogy dedicated to 3 witches, each one haunting an ancient residence- is surely the biggest film he's done in terms of making a name for himself. His originality and love of music showed throughout most of his following movies. But Suspiria's music and sounds were rarely matched in the genre.<br /><br />Dario loves to play with his actors and his camera crew. He loves to play with colours and he won't hesitate to show his audience the most gruesome death scenes in such a gorgeous way (Say for the first murder scene in Suspiria). He's one of the master at using and even overusing the old cliches and he does it pretty well and without shame. Back during the days whenthe Murder/Mystery and Horror flicks were still fresh, scary and fun, Argento was arguably the master at it.<br /><br />The story 4 Suspiria: Suzie Banyon (Jessica Harper) is a young American that came to a prestigious Ballet school in Germany. But the European Dance Academy runned by Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett from Dark Shadows) hides some sinister secret. Indeed, one so dark that those who find out about it or try to escape are killed off one by one.<br /><br />If the story, actors and even the voiceovers could have been much better (In English, i recommend the french version which was really good) these are the only flaws. This witch tale is guaranteed to stay buried deep within the minds of many viewers and todays paranormal flicks could never stand an inch tall in front of this masterpiece. The flicks trying to pay Suspiria the smallest hommage or the smallest amount of respect, taking their inspiration from this flick have for the most part failed miserably sadly.<br /><br />So, that you like or not Horror, Suspense, Mystery and Giallo movies, you should give this one a shot and instead of judging it for its acting and writing talents, just judge it based on the effort put forth behind the camera, the way the movie was rendered and how they intended to tell the story from the start. The Images, the colours, the score. Because i think i heard that from someone once and i Totally agree and quote: \\"Not liking Suspiria, is the same as not liking cinema/movies at all.\\"<br /><br />10/10 Devilishly Delicious!! Or Deliciously devilish?
B008D36INE|3.0|in my opinion there was to much memory reversal. they could have made the whole movie as a memory reversal instead of jumping back and forth
B0019X3ZZY|3.0|The premise is interesting and undated and can apply anywhere at anytime. However, the execution of it is disturbing. One needs a strong stomach and an open mind in order to view this film. Yikes! Don't watch after eating, or if you have a sensitive stomach or you may find yourself throwing up. Whatever you do, don't watch it while eating chocolate or you'll never eat chocolate again.  I couldn't even watch this film to the end. I couldn't even watch it from the beginning after I looked up the synopsis on Wikipedia. My spouse, however did watch the entire film and he has a cast-iron stomach, but almost \\"tossed his cookies\\" in one scene of this movie.<br />Didn't care much for the ending either. Real life is depressing enough and in this type of film, you always want to see some retribution of payback to the evil entity.
B009CPE424|5.0|My Granddaughter loves it, she watches it whenever she is over. Its a cute movie but only for the kiddies.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|My first novel by william Landay was \\"The Strangler\\" which I found fairly disappointing. After that, I was hesitant to read \\"Defending Jacob\\". I finally listened to the unabridged audiobook version last week and really enjoyed it. It was so much better than \\"The Strangler\\" that it's really hard to believe both novels were written by the same author.<br />In \\"Defending Jacob\\", we spend a lot of time in courtrooms and these scenes are really fascinating as far as I'm concerned.<br />But the ultimate question of Jacob's guilt is the centerpiece of the novel and to the very end, I couldn't make up my mind one way or the other. I don't have children, but I could just imagine the excruciating pain of wondering about your child and this brought to mind the many parents of incarcerated children around the country. Do we forgive our children and/or ourselves? Did we do that? Did we make them what they are? And how far do we go to protect them? Those are the many questions posed by Andy Barber.<br />The style was elegant and flowed effortlessly.<br />Recommended.<br /><br />Potential spoilers ahead:<br />In the end, I thought of \\"My Cousin Rachel\\" by Daphne du Maurier which also left her readers wondering.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'll try to review without posting spoilers.<br /><br />Overall I did enjoy the series, and am glad I read it.  I did not like how they wrapped it up though.  It felt like the author was trying to catch you by surprise by doing this or that.  They have no problem killing off characters which should come at no surprise given the premise of the series is about the Hunger Games where 24 children are sent to an arena to fight to the death.  It just was a bit darker than I expected, and also felt like there was a slight gap between book 2, and 3.  Otherwise it was a nice read, and I enjoyed nearly all the characters :)
0345533054|4.0|This was the second time I read \\"Gone for Good\\" and it was as good as the first time. Coben is really the master when it comes to those stories. I liked the hint of humor that accompanied the main character though it was not as intrusive as in some of his Myron Bolitar's novels. The story itself was typical Coben. In that, he reminds me of the French writer Xavier de Montepin (1823-1902), an author of soap operas and popular dramas who could write a serial novel and have it published over the course of several years.<br />This is not to criticize Coben, only to admire his ability to spin a tale so complex that when you think it's over, there are still surprises to come. Most of his novels follow the same pattern and while always entertaining, you can more or less guess the outcome. That being said, I really liked his main character, Will, and sympathized with his various plights. Also, the various characters surrounding him were all interesting though I thought The Ghost was maybe a little overdone?<br />Good read, entertaining to the very end. Definitely recommended.
B003UBTX72|5.0|This book was much better than I had expected.  Lots of insight on songs you've heard all you life.  He also gets inside the personalities of the band along with all the fringe people.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Interesting story.  it holds interest and reads smoothly but not the best reading entertainment available.<br /><br />OK and interesting to read.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I am not really a fan of voxel-type games. I love modern graphics. But this one so well executed that I find myself reaching for it often. The interface and game design is a standard in its class. It goes to show what we all learned in programming classes, over and over: interface design is of primary importance. Get this game. You will not be disappointed.
B003VANOFY|5.0|best headset i have ever owned and i have had a bunch of them. very user friendly and great audio
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Not bad.  I don't know if it can deliver all of the features that its PC counterpart does.  I'll explore more.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Hard to put down. Enjoyed  very much .  Liked the dog brought into the story.  Nice twist to the sisters.
B00979CS50|5.0|Became one of my most played, favorite albums within a couple of days. Fantastic! Thanks Neil!!! I don't know how you do it, but please keep on doing it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I liked it because it's something that could happen in the future. But I wouldn't want it to happen! This book was so good, I'm going to read the next one.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|The music is a lot of fun, and the story line is cute. Great way to hook younger readers on the idea of reading the Odyssey. Worth watching a few times for the music, and always catch something new and funny in the dialogue.
B003G4W49C|1.0|And sadly this one is his best. After read a few other of his works, thinking he would have grown as an author, I gave up and moved on to other authors. Save your time and money.
B004AO1FF6|5.0|Was not a big fan of the original Dr. Who show and did not even know about it before Tom Baker's doctor.  Watching through from this new series 1 with Christopher Eggleston because I knew the plots are very involved and they refer back to things that happened in earlier seasons all the time.  Extremely good acting and entertaining stories and very high-caliber guest appearances throughout.  Am continuing on, trying to catch up with the Doctor in real time as they are (spoilers) on to series 7 with Matt Smith already.
B0017YDPI2|5.0|Third Powerful Season explodes with action and suspense. A must own Blu Ray sensation!!! The best features and clarity ever. Supernatural Rocks!!
B007GCY8FS|4.0|For a Reacher book, a little dull in the first 2/3rd, but it picks up in the end.<br /><br />I will always read a Reacher book, and hope to see a couple of more Cruise/Reacher movies.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Love listening to music while I am bored, Better than Pandora.  I love Amazon!! Keep the good things going<br />and I will get more
