B000065V3H|5.0|Nice addition to my 80's movies collection. Patrick Dempsey is wonderful in this movie. Love it! I would recommend it to anyone!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Overshadowed by the TV series it spawned, but the movie was much more subtle, and explored questions of technology, communication, memory, overcoming fear, and recovery after loss.  For the record, though, I'm probably going to check out any science fiction movie that explores hermeneutics and employs a linquist on the crew.<br /><br />Science is sketchy in many places, but not in ways that would have changed the story had they been corrected.
B00008438V|4.0|I love 80's movies, as most can tell by my collection. This 1 is a classic, with a  young Robert Downey Jr. it's a must  have!
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Good performances.  Good sets and overall look.  Script not strong enough to carry a feature film.  Not enough story to justify the length.  Had I not known otherwise, I would have guessed it was based on a video game, rather than a long established comic book character.

B005DKLPQ0|5.0|My husband is a huge Smiths fan and he loves this album, has all the tunes and is well made.
B00F0AI9Y4|4.0|First of all, this isn't the complete album, which is why I ended up scrambling for my iTunes account, this is missing \\"Long Road To Hell\\" (personal favorite) and \\"Edom\\" (not exactly my best choice), other than that, I felt it was a shame that Avicii removed the lyrics from \\"Heart Upon My Sleeve\\", and re-did the vocals for \\"Dear Boy\\".
B007SGLZP8|5.0|this is a great John Grisham book. it kept me on the edge of my seat with lots of twists
B003G4W49C|5.0|The first time I read this, I got hung up on a couple disturbing scenes, so only sort of liked it. The 2nd time I read it, I was a little more prepared and I really loved it. Recommended it to my whole family.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had a little difficulty at first since there are minimal instructions but figured it out.  It is fun and challenging.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I loved this book. I love the way he describes time and also how liberating truth can be. Great read.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This modern day fairy tale captures the magic, wonder and terror of childhood. A beautifully written book that leaves an indelible mark on your emotions.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|It was a tough read b/c I'm the same age as Alice.  But, I couldn't put the book down.  Great read.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I like the way that each chapter is like its own little book. I tend to loose interest with books half halfway through but with this series i am always excited when i see the name of the new chapter.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not what I should be doing on a football Sunday when the Jets are doing everything to lose this game.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This author takes the tragedy of quadriplegia and shows that can be joyous even in this circumstances.  There is no mushy melodrama or denial of the harsh facts of the individual life or of society.  Life is tough, living is treacherous, yet the characters overcome adversity and find meaning and finally joy.  The humor accompanying the events is fairly achieved and no unbelievable events occur.  See this movie -- my favorite in a long, long time.
B0011Z52EW|4.0|This song has so many versions it was hard to tell which one I was purchasing.  This version is a little raw for me but I think that it may be a good representation of the artist's sentiment.  I am old, so I like the polished version a little better.<br />Even for an old gal this is great music.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I am not a Zombie fan so watching this movie should not have been a good choice.  I enjoyed it any way, especially the rapid transition of those infected!  Worth watching, though I am glad I did not go to the theater to watch it.....
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Wondered what all the fuss was about.  Once I started I was hooked.  I would have continues just for Maggie Smith.  She is a treasure.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I love a movie that keeps you guessing and this is one of those, add to that spectacular magic tricks, gimmicks and special effects.  Everyone gave great performances and you will be guessing right up to the end!

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show keeps you on the edge and it's creepy. I loved season one, but season two is so much different I think I love it too.
1442359919|5.0|Devon Jones', rising college Sophomore, gets a job in a small, quaint amusement park on the coast of South Carolina, he did so to earn money for college and have some place to be while his girlfriend became a \\"Filene's Girl\\" in Boston for the summer. When said girl breaks his heart, he is lucky to be a member of the \\"Joyland\\" family, where he could \\"wait until she comes back\\" and nurse his pain during the wait.  His work ethic and unique physical appearance (redheaded and stands 6'4\\") gets him quickly noticed in the park, his work \\"wearing the fur\\" (donning the costume of \\"Happy Hound,\\" the park's mascot, in the South Carolina summer sun) distinguishes him from the other \\"summer greenies\\" (the designation all new employees are given). Within his first hours of employment, he learns of the unsolved murder in the \\"park's only dark  ride\\" (Horror House) four years previous, of a young lady whose ghost is reported to haunt the ride and occasionally show herself to park employees, always \\"after the park closes.\\"<br />Mr. King takes this possibly pedestrian plot and creates a memorable fun, delightfully thrilling, \\"old school\\" crime novel set in 1973.  Told from the first person perspective of Devon \\"Dev\\" Jones, the reader is given the occasion to remember/experience a time when gas was $11 a barrel, summer break lasted until after Labor Day and murders (seemed to be) a rare occurrence.  It is the innocence of this age that makes the plot both plausible and frightening; the methods by which crimes were solved were much more primitive and only in a time when \\"CSI\\" investigative techniques are not common knowledge could the murderer elude capture for so long.<br />This is a \\"Coming-of-Age\\" story as well.  Devon's experience of being on his own in a culture foreign to him gives a backdrop to the crime allowing the reader to experience of being \\"on the outside\\" as well.  Devon (and the reader) must learn the language, traditions and taboos of the Amusement Park/\\"Carny\\" society as he becomes a member of that family.  Mr. King uses this process as a powerful metaphor for Devon's growing into an adulthood where the language sounds the same but the words come with much more responsibility, traditions are created for oneself and old traditions are renewed or discarded consistent with the life one is discovering and those evils from which a child is sheltered are exposed in all their Technicolor flashes.<br />This is a book for adults in the style of Mickey Spillane and Dashiell Hammett crime novels.  Violence exists but only (occasionally graphically) glimpsed, sex is a given, but only in whispered suggestions, the crimes are gruesome & random and the criminal loathsome.  This volume is the second in a series from the \\"Hard Case Crime\\" publishers and it is good enough that I want to read the first installment.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I recommend this book to people who like an adventure. I gave it 4stars because he has many details, characters feelings and when he surprises you with new suprises. Also when he leaves you wondering what will happen next. I am looking forward to reading House of Hades. I was upset that he didn't  discuss a little more on Percy and Grover.

B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Had I thought about Ms. Atwood's approach to the first two volumes of this trilogy, I probably would not have been as surprised at her approach to &#34;MaddAddan&#34;.  My expectations of something more linear in plotting speaks more to my shortcomings as a reader than hers as a author.  This is a wonderful book and a fitting conclusion to my favorite trilogy of all time.  Ms. Atwood has a wonderful mind and a unique voice from which I, and probably, most of her other readers are able to bask,  What more can a reader ask!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Each season, the plot keeps getting better and more surprising.  Add that to impressive acting and this show totally rocks!
0316017930|4.0|The main premise of the book, as outlined by Malcom is: \\"In Outliers, I want to convince you that these kinds of personal explanations of success don't work. People don't rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage. The people who stand before kings may look like they did it all by themselves. But in fact they are invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot. It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is mainly by asking where they dire from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.\\"<br /><br />Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"Wolf and Bruhn had to convince the medical establishment to think about health and heart attacks in an entirely new way: they had to get them to realize that they wouldn't be able to understand why someone was healthy if all they did was think about an individual's personal choices or actions in isolation. They had to look beyond the individual. They had to understand the culture he or she was a part of, and who their friends and families were, and what town their families came from. They had to appreciate the idea that the values of the world we inhabit and the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are. In Outliers I want to do for our understanding of success what Stewart Wolf did for our understanding of health.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"Their research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That's it. And what's more, the people at the very top don't work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"We pretend that success is exclusively a matter of individual merit. But there's nothing in any of the histories we've looked at so far to suggest things are that simple. These are stories, instead, about people who were given a special opportunity to work really hard and seized it, and who happened to come of age at a time when that extraordinary effort was rewarded by the rest of society. Their success was not just of their own making. It was a product of the world in which they grew up.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"The relationship between success and IQ works only up to a point. Once someone has reached an IQ of somewhere around 120, having additional IQ points doesn't seem to translate into any measurable real-world advantage.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"Those three things--autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward--are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying...Work that fulfills those three criteria is meaningful.\\"<br /><br />6- \\"So far in Outliers we've seen that success arises out of the steady accumulation of advantages: when and where you are born, what your parents did tor a living, and what the circumstances of your upbringing were all make a significant difference in how well you do in the world. The question for the second part of Outliers is whether the traditions and attitudes we inherit from our forebears can play the same role. Can we learn something about why people succeed and how to make people better at what they do by taking cultural legacies seriously? 1 think we can.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"Each of us has his or her own distinct personality. But overlaid on top of that are tendencies and assumptions and reflexes handed down to us by the history of the community we grew up in, and those differences are extraordinarily specific.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"The lesson here is very simple. But itis striking how ten it is overlooked. We are so caught in the myths ot the best and the brightest and the self-made that we think outliers spring naturally from the earth. We look at the young Bill Gates and marvel that our world allowed that thirteen-year-old to become a fabulously successful entrepreneur. But that's the wrong lesson. Our world only allowed one thirteen-year-old unlimited access to a timesharing terminal in 1968. If a million teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many more Microsofts would we have today? To build a better world we need to replace the patchwork of lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages that today determine success--the fortunate birth dates and the happy accidents of history--with a society that provides opportunities for all.\\"<br /><br />9- \\"Superstar lawyers and math whizzes and software entrepreneurs appear at first blush to lie outside ordinary experience. But they don't. They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky--but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.\\"is striking how ten it is overlooked.

B004LWZW8S|4.0|This movie did the job for being a decent action movie. Reading about people comparing it to 300 and Clash of the Titans...why? You know what it had similar to clash of the Titans? The Greek Gods. Done. With 300? One scene in the film where he bolstered the troops resolve to fight. Done. Someone's always trying to compare something for no reason most of the time. Anyway, again, it does the job.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|When Eureka was on TV, I never really got into it. Since finding it on Amazon Prime, I watch one or more episodes a day. My teenage grandson has started watching it with me. I really enjoy the characters. It's nice to see geniuses portrayed as something other than stuffy and dull.

B008ODZUN2|5.0|This movie concerns a young woman -Rachel Weisz- married to an older man who is also a court Judge.  Her father is a Vicker.  Neither of the two men give the young woman (Rachel) the emotional support or real love that she needs.  She goes down the wrong path by having an affair with a friend of her husband.  Things continue to go wrong for this young woman with no love and her estranged husband now wanting to hurt her in any way.  Her father practically turns his back on her.  Even the affair she engaged in turned into something sad and disappointing.  She finally comes to the realization that she must go on and live her life without approval or love from the men she once thought very highly of.  The time is in the early 50's in England with wonderful scenes of old cars and homes/flats and clothes.  Very entertaining movie, sad, and thought provoking.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This macabre tale is unlike anything else on tv. It's full of mystery, deceit, fear, betrayal and anything else you can possibly imagine.  I highly recommend it but not for those who are easily disgusted.  My new fave show!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|My daughter plays this game daily and I see her  thinking outside the box more when doing writing assignments. Highly recommended this ap for students of all ages!!!!!

0321647440|1.0|\\"Facebook\\" has three subheadings in the index. \\"Keyboard Shortcuts\\" has two. In a section about exposure, the two axes of a histogram are shown and explained. This is followed by \\"Still confused? That's OK. It's not so easy to grasp at first\\" (OK you may not have heard the term \\"histogram\\" before but you would recognize its meaning the instant you saw one. There is one in a current toilet paper commercial). This book is useless for anyone who needs to use Aperture to manage many images. Very little or no information on import, export, metadata, keyboard, menu items, managed vs referenced libraries, or how Finder searches for images based on metadata. Some of the most powerful and confusing features of Aperture are not mentioned at all, such as customized keyboard shortcuts and various options for organizing exported files in the Finder. It might be useful to someone who wants to learn fundamental image editing and is not inclined to just experiment.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|It was a great book that made me think in every turn &#34;What if&#34;. The possibilities are endless and the similarities to our existing world makes it even more in line with how technology can be used and what can it become in the near future.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|In his 10th Jack Reacher novel, Lee Child again places his hero, the giant with frozen turkey-sized fists into a scenario in which he's arbitrarily selected to participate in an intense unfolding drama. This one puts him in the employ of one Edward Lane, angry, ex-military and vowing revenge and destruction on whomever kidnapped his beautiful wife. Then we find out there's a kid involved. Lane didn't mention it at first. It's the first indication readers get that this man, who now heads a seemingly top-notch private security team, is not as above board as he first would seem. Lane promises Reacher a bucketload of money to find his wife, and Reacher takes the case. Nothing works out for Reacher. But Child strings out the clues from the first details in which Reacher spots the purported kidnapper getting into and driving off in a Mercedes. Tension builds until the last third of the book when the whole case evolves in Lee Child style. Then the action takes off and Reacher does some serious ass kicking. He always does, right? Which reminds me of bumping into another Reacher fan in a used book store. He had three Reacher books to go and hadn't read them in sequence like I did. He said whenever he spots the Brit phrasing in the dialogue it drives him a little nuts. I can't say that I've been put off with it nor did I really spot anything. But now I'll be looking for it.

B006S053K8|2.0|This is a bad film. Lots of people here agree. But why? You won't learn why from those many brief whines. But the reviewers who love it, using words like honest and touching, are full of baloney. Or are people like the protagonist. a selfish and self absorbed jerk, who spends his life obsessed with sex and whom he can get it from. He claims to be an intellectual, but he and his friends are all frauds. Those arrogant friends, far better than the Neanderthals who inhabit their world and don't know who Gogol was or enjoy wasting their money trying to win crappy prizes, have to endure the agony of an entry level job. How awful for such astounding intellects and higher beings! How they will retaliate when they get tenure.<br /><br />Grubby unappealing little worms, hating the clingers to guns and religion, these characters hope to escape to a world where their higher powers will be recognized. Yuck.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very easy read and I enjoyed the storyline. The author did an excellent job developing characters. My only disappointment was the ending (probably more a personal preference).
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show, and season two blew this show out of the water. I hope and pray that season 3 is just as good or better. You will get a kick out of this show. If you have not seen this show, I recommend to start at the beginning and work your way up.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|At first glance, the story is about Auggie''s first year as a middle schooler.  A kid with a chraneo  facial genetic disorder that has been home schooled by his caring mother and protected by his family.  But then the story is told also by all the young people around August, and it is not always about him.  We are always too quick to judge,  we do not walk into other people's shoes.  At the end of the day, we all have our insecurities and fears.  We have been scared of what we do not know,  we envied other people's lives sometimes or we feel we have been trapped by the circumstances around us.  I liked the fact the story is told in different voices to show that at the end of the day, no matter what, we go thru stuff in life and we feel is really bad even if we get some perspective.  The book should be a must read for every children heading to middle school because they will identify with the situations.  It is a hard age.  Parents and teachers should read it too.  We often forget how hard was to grow up,  how hard it still is.  The book tell us that when courage and kindness intersects, magic happens, a lesson for everyone.
B00CHMBQ0C|5.0|ERASED is a surprisingly good film. Aaron Eckhart is excellent. It's time he got a role such as this. This is a good espionage movie. It has a unique perspective and disctinct point of view. It definitely deserves a look.<br /><br />I love this stuff. An ex CIA agent working his next paycheck gets involved in more intrigue and mayhem! Good stuff here and its is done first rate.
B00E95ED32|5.0|Just a terrific first album for Avicii - addictive listening for me - personal faves - Liar/Liar (Blondfire) - Lay Me Down (wow Rodgers' guitar and Lambert's vocals) - Addicted to You (take that, Adele).  Not a lemon in the bunch.  Kids all like it, too - especially LL and LMD.  Definitely recommend.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|First, I must say that I am very familiar with the Warrens, paranormal investigators in Connecticut. I think this film does justice to some their work. Director James Wan's THE CONJURING is truly frightening, but there is beauty in the details here. It is a very interesting film in that respect, yet very aluring and hypnotic at least for me. The visual quality of this film is mesmerizing. It draws you in and never lets go. There is truth, there is beauty in the simplicity of the narrative. I have friends who knew the real paranormal investigators Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren. This film is a bit personal for me. One thing that drew me to this film was the 1-sheet poster. It spoke to me. The Wilmington, North Carolina locations were a good choice. Those locations really capture the mood. I know.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I very much enjoyed the first season, can not wait to dig into the second.  The sherlock character is very engaging and works well off watson.
B00AHDXTIK|4.0|Wire is thick and stiff. However works good. Has not failed like the cheaper wires. Took a risk on this one because every one of the other longer wires just failed after a short time of use.
1451626096|1.0|This review is about the book The White Princess by Phillippa Gregory, published July 23, 2013, fourth in the Cousins' War Series, soon to be a series by BBC, available in hardback, paperback, audiobook, and Kindle edition, 544 pages long, ISBN number...<br /><br />  I am giving this book one star not just because I am unable to give it no stars, but because it is bloody hard to write like that.  Phillipa Gregory deserves kudos for catering to the evidently large percentage of her readers who suffer from otherwise debilitating medical conditions.  The following is a list of those disorders whose sufferers this book is obviously directed towards.<br /><br />*Recurring Retrograde Amnesia*: The frustrations of forgetting what you read ten pages ago are a thing of the past.  Not only that, but you will no longer be frustrated by forgetting what you read ten pages ago!  Who is this book about? Elizabeth of York.  Who does she love? Her uncle, Richard III.  What house is she from?  The Royal House of York!  (Ten pages later...)  Who is this book about?...<br />  *Non-sufferers: For those who do not suffer from RRA, there will be an exam on this later.<br /><br />*Dysfunctional Palate*:  Finally! A book that respects the ability to stomach ANYTHING.  Ms. Gregory understands the sideways glances you normally receive because you don't gag over a young girl recounting her romantic trysts with her deceased uncle.  Normal readers will be envious of the ease with which you swallow Elizabeth's tearful recollections of her plans with her lover, Uncle Richard, & the children they would have had, the kingdom they would have run, the steamy nights they would have enjoyed, ad nauseaum (but not for you!)<br />  *Non-sufferers: Though gag reflex-invoking and complete fabrication, an uncle-niece union was not unheard of in royal marriages.  The House of Hapsburg inbred itself to extinction with familial interrelations.  In the present day, many families have a \\"funny uncle,\\" and if there was a war going on, he would likely be abandoned, stabbed, and left for dead.  Like Richard III.<br /><br />*Fantasy-prone Personality*: Two family lines battle over a crown in a war that lasts over 30 years, ravages a country still marred by the 100 Years War, & ripples through history to affect the royal dynasty to this day.  There are plots and schemes, murders, sword fights, betrayals, greedy ambitions, and trials of the heart.<br />  How mundane.<br />  Because history is so very dull, Ms. Gregory has spiced it up to tantalize the senses of even the most colourful and abstract dreamers.  You will enjoy witchcraft (including a relatively non-specific curse,) a hunt for a murderer made much more enjoyable by the complete disregard of facts from heavily researched events, a rape to begin painting what would ordinarily have been a decent king with a tainted brush, and a pretender to Prince Richard who actually isn't pretending!  Ms. Gregory, with a touch of artistic license, manages to embellish historical events so well even those with FPP will be unable to resist.  Finally, FPP sufferers can be part of the real (um...) world.<br />  *Non-sufferers: Even I had to admire the pressing of poetically-licensed boundaries.  King Henry VII, at his mother's behest, raped his future bride while everyone else was having dinner in the next room.  I NEVER could have dreamed something like that up.  I do think Ms. Gregory did the readers a grave injustice by not including the conversation between his mother (Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby, My Lady the King's Mother...) & Henry that led up to this decision.  \\"Henry, you've outgrown that shirt. Oh and right before dessert...\\"<br /><br />*Blunted Affect*:  This disorder is perhaps the most obviously & prevalently catered to by this book.  It would otherwise be impossible to read it in any sort of company.  Your skills of stoicism will finally be challenged when you read Elizabeth's pining without disgust, herrape without horror, her growing love for her rapist without stupefaction, \\"the Royal House of York\\" line without irritation, & the rest without zeal because the end MUST be in sight.<br />  *Non-sufferers: Read this book in private or you will be beleaguered by questions asking if you are okay and do you need a bin in case you are sick.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, I do not suffer from any of the aforementioned ailments.  Consequently, this book was difficult to read and enjoy with its unnecessary elaborations on already interesting historical events, repetitive dialogue in unrealistic human interactions, and solicitations of strong, negative emotions to the point I felt nauseous.  I typically enjoy Ms. Gregory's books, but this book was so far from her baseline style of writing for this era, I felt as if it was certainly not written for the typical audience.  Sufferers of above-mentioned disorders are my most educated guess as to whom Ms. Gregory was writing for, because it certainly was not for me.  -C.rape without horror, her growing love for her rapist without stupefaction, \\"the Royal House of York\\" line without irritation, & the rest without zeal because the end MUST be in sight.<br />  *Non-sufferers: Read this book in private or you will be beleaguered by questions asking if you are okay and do you need a bin in case you are sick.<br /><br />  Unfortunately, I do not suffer from any of the aforementioned ailments.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good book. Kept my attention and had a few surprises in the plot. Did not want to put it down.
B00DU74U74|5.0|This movie was interesting from beginning to the end. It also was had some paranormal romance. This movie was very good.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|I enjoyed the previous two films and this proved no exception. It's no classic, but it is a fun watch. In this film it's not just Tony Stark who's been tinkering, he's up against someone who has been conducting his own experiments. The principal bad guy is terrorist seemingly with the ability to strike anywhere, including Stark's home when he brashly issues a challenge on live TV.<br /><br />Stark shows a bit more of a human side in this film, revealing a few flaws, nothing too dramatic, but it just adds another dimension to the film. As with the previous films Stark is the star of the show, he's funny, but nothing we haven't seen before.<br /><br />The bad guy is ok, solid enough but again nothing that really stands out. A fun watch for a couple of hours but nothing more.
B00321GTJU|5.0|I loved Planet Earth it was interesting, and they showed the scenery and the animals in great detail. This was a good animal show.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my step daughter loves playing this game. it is one of the things we started to do together for fun. she wants a real horse but this was the next beet thing
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Was different from the book but still entertaining maybe because I'm in to Zombies. Much better than other movies I've seen lately
B00CIAYYU2|5.0|Greatest kung-fu movie of all time. The fight scenes are remarkable with a bit of humor. From the first scene you are sucked in and can't stop watching.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Incredible tale of the times! The characters, the plot and the time in history were so well described that I still can picture it all occurring months after finishing the book.
0316247545|5.0|I got this for my daughters 5th b-day. Her and my almost 10 year old LOVE MLP. I was a little disappointed because it said it had the words to all of the songs in it, and it doesn't. There was 1 song in particular all of us wanted to be in the book and it wasn't, but other than that this book is great. The girls both love it. There are some sections in the book they probably won't care anything about, because it geared towards older kids, but that's not a big deal. They will still find it interesting.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|The original was much better. I know it was a remake, but I think the actor that played Dredd should have tried to be more original, instead of trying to be like Stallone.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Very good book about the experiences both Marian and Laila had gone through in Afghanistan. I recommend this book to those who haven't read it yet.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|This was a great ending to a great series. Even thou its no historically correct the series was great. I wish there was more,
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Very good app. Quick download to my kindle fire. Easy to understand and use. Would recommend to my friends. A definite keeper.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I'm a marathon runner, century cyclist, and Ironman triathlete, but I am slow one.  But despite my lack of speed, I still love that feeling of lining up at the start line and thinking back to every minute of training you've put in to reaching that point, and wondering what the next 13.1, 26.2 or 51 miles have in store for you.  McDougall manages to capture that feeling and put it into words - both for the experienced endurance athlete and the couch potato.  This book is well written and captivating from the first page, and will be enjoyed by anyone that loves an inspirational story.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I first saw this movie on TV and I was so impressed with the story content about this dog.<br />It's a deeply moving and true story about this dog, that everyone loved.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Dazzling read from start to finish and I can't wait to read book two and see the series on HBO.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|this game is fun and worth while I would reccomend it but ever since the update when I load the game it says no server connection and other devices have been having this problem. I have a kindle.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Great  series. Watch it all the time with my girls. Action packed acting is great. Keeps you on the edge of you seat.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I won this book in a giveaway. I could choose whatever book I wanted, but because I have such a hard time choosing books (read: I want them all!!!!!) I gave the organizer carte blanche to give me whatever book she fancied. She so wanted to give me this book, because she read the ARC and was blown away. So I had to wait for the release date. But by then I had other reading responsibilities, so I got to reading it just now. And BOY! Am I glad with her choice! Thank you Meagan!!!<br /><br />This book was so so so fun! The main character was such a playboy but he was oh so fun! I loved and adored that it was written from his point of view, you don't see a lot of books - ok romance books - evolving with and around the man's POV. The author did a awesome job! I laughed and I cried and I read it in one sitting. You will not be able to resist Drew's charm, I can tell you that! But it's not just the charms he lays on you as a playboy, he has depth, although he would like you to think otherwise. And although the book isn't that particularly long - in pages and in time passing in the book - you do see a lot of character development there. I loved that. I for one, cannot wait to get my hands on the next book in this series. Who am I kidding, if all of Emma Chase's books are this good, I'm going to stalk everything she writes!
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|I was completely surprised with this movie! i enjoyed it alot, i would definitely recommend it! Ann Hathaway  and Jake Gyllenhaal work very well together
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book, the whole series is great, even if it is a little twisted at some points in it. Great read!
B000GPI2CM|3.0|Nothing incredible. I played it once and hoped it might be a nice reference disc. Love Linn products, but this SACD is just average.
B001BZRUR4|4.0|Great Read. Thought provoking and really interesting! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good book. Characters are quirky and lovable!
B003M6FGTE|3.0|Don't like musicals too much but I am enjoying Glee!  I recommend it, highly.  The harmony along with the actors is brilliant.  I just like it, hope you do too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love playing this game.  It has awesome graphics and really realistic sounds.  It really captures what you need to do to take care of real horse.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I liked the premise of the film and it clearly had the acting talent to make it work. Overall, I think they did a good job but not a great job.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I enjoyed how the book opened with characters who seemed unconnected to each other, then showed how their lives intertwined.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|Possibly the best surfing story ever put out by Hollywood.  If you<br />collect surfing movies this goes right up there on the shelf with<br />Endless Summer, Big Wednesday and Point Break.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This story was easy to read and quite compelling. I hated to put it down because I cared about the characters and wanted to find out what happened next.
B004AM5QT4|1.0|It's inconceivable to me that the author of Pillars of the Earth could come up with something so bad.  Had the political characterizations been written by Nancy Pelosi, they would have been more balanced.  The plot was entirely predictable, the dialogue juvenile, and the brilliant characters incredibly stupid at times.<br /><br />The research was atrocious.  For example, one of the Pentagon employees was an overweight 50 something female lieutenant.  In the first place, the military doesn't have junior officers in their 50's.  In the second place, junior officers with weight problems are disciplined, not given plum jobs in the Pentagon.  Soldiers don't fire warning shots, especially not inside the Pentagon.  The black WWII veteran had an antique pistol that he took off a German because black soldiers weren't allowed weapons, even in a war zone.  The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps are proper nouns and should be capitalized.  Police officers don't carry their weapons into interrogation rooms and jail.  The list goes on and on.  Follett is usually a much better researcher.<br /><br />In short, had Ken Follett's name not been on the cover, no one outside the author's family would pay to read tripe like this.  Follett is a great author.  I don't know what happened to convince him to publish this train wreck.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Especially for a &#34;Free&#34; app.  The ads are unobtrusive, a quick flash BETWEEN games so you don't get distracted while playing.  You'll enjoy playing this, it has many options in scoring, setup, and layout.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|the entire book kept me hooked and then the ending was fantastic - pow!  it was really a great read!
B008602KQI|5.0|When will people learn that war is not the anwser?<br />I read the 3 books; they had a warning message.<br />Not for children until 13.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Love the program - but I see it drifting to an end, which is an utter shame. They had a lot of good story-lines. The writer all have slumps, they need to drink some high test coffee and get the show moving again.
B00190OHD6|5.0|What an amazing love story! And it flows so well, great cast, great climax just wonderful! I Love this movie!
B0092S4WLY|3.0|i liked this game but i beat it too quickly. it was fun while it lasted though. so i give 3 stars
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Very good app. Took off over 800 Mb on first run. Easy to use and effective. Works on Kindle. I would recommend it.
B00C5ZNUCS|5.0|This band is what we metal fans have been waiting for. This band gives me hope. Hail Satan! Ave Satanas!
B001BANK32|5.0|Wow. I decided to re-read this book in anticipation of Dr. Sleep and was pleasantly surprised. I first attempted to read this book when I was eight, at which point my mother discovered it and took it away from me in horror after nightmares kept me awake for a few nights. I went back to it in my teen years, and read it at least three more times. And then I put it away as childish.<br /><br />Don't get my wrong, I love Stephen King. And The Shining was a must for a child of Colorado, growing up not far from Estes Park. The Stanley Hotel is said to be The Overlook, although it is in Estes Park and not higher up, and it is reachable in the winter. But there came a time when I believed I had outgrown that kind of scary, forgetting how psychologically scary The Shining actually is.<br /><br />I re-read this just in time for the sequel, Dr. Sleep, about 35 years after The Shining. And it is just a creepy-scary, just as real. Just like many books, re-reading it creates a different feeling. Reading it as a child I identified with Danny, the young son with \\"the shining.\\" This time I'm a mother and a wife and I read it identifying with Wendy AND Jack. Both are flawed but wanting to be better, but sometimes the demons find you.<br /><br />And, like most Americans, the movie has snuck into my thinking. I remember both Jack and Wendy differently because of the movie (which is good, but doesn't do them justice). In the movie, Jack lets the evil in easily, which doesn't happen in the book. And Wendy is a dishrag of a woman, which she definitely in not in King's rendition of her.<br /><br />Needless to say, this book still scared me. It made me jump on more than one occasion. And I can't wait for Dr. Sleep.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a very interesting new game that I am thrilled to have bought, just challenging enough to hold my interest &amp; not get repetitive.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Great drama.  Good story keeps you in it the whole movie.  Rough story but good watch.  If you want drama movie to watch.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|I LOVE it! It kept of phone safe throughout many falls. I like the design. It makes the phone look more attractive.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|The movie is made well.  Acting is also good.  If you are into scifi and action you will enjoy the movie.  Lots of action. Not much character development.  Good watch though.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|The movie was great with a lot of action and also funny all together it great a movie thank you
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watch and wait. Every episode is riveting, but the season finale will leave you breathless. I found it overwhelming and highly emotional.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Another unoriginal plot involving zombies. The movie was entertaining, but not spectacular. The acting was fine as well as special effects.
B003SHUMRI|5.0|This has a great story line, it has some awesome dancing and best of all there's Channing Tatum!! :D  What more could you ask for??
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The Ocean at the End of Lane is a delightful Neil Gaiman fantasy filled with children and spirits and a suspended state of reality painted with just enough darkness to cause goosebumps. Is it an adult novel? Probably the marketing hype was written to lure adults who already like Gaiman's children and young adult work, but it does the book a disservice. The Ocean doesn't wander far from Gaiman' other works in its appeal to a younger audience--and those who enjoy children or young adult literature. I liked The Ocean and read it straight through on a lazy weekend day. But I wanted more from a novel marketed as an adult work by this wonderful writer. I wanted Gaiman to show more character development, more story, more challenge for the adult reader. Reading The Ocean, as an adult novel, was a bit like drinking exceptional grape juice when the menu offered a vintage wine.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Easy to play but keep getting frustrated that just as you get into it you run out of credits. Despite this it is still a very goo game.
B0017VG69U|5.0|Excellent job of remastering the series! Loved every minute of it!
B008EKOIN8|4.0|The author's opinions on evolution and cooking were fascinating and thought provoking. I am a vegetarian so that may color my outlook. Easy read with plenty of substance .
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|This compelling film is dark, disturbing and compelling. It's sheer suspense with a great script, superb acting, and even the music and period details lend such a noir ambiance to the flick. I am a big fan of mysteries and intrigue that are combined with the thriller genre. I really liked this film a lot. Recommended for your darkest mystery cravings.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great movie! Movie flowed very smoothly there wasn't a \\"lull\\" like in some movies where it became boring, definitely worth checking out!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|This show was recommended to me by a friend, and I was not disappointed.  The production values may seem low to the modern eye, but who cares -- this show has intelligent writing, fine acting, and memorable characters and storylines that pull you in from the beginning.  Vastly superior to the overpraised &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; (which is based on a similar concept) in character nuance, believability, and subtlety of presentation.  Gordon Jackson is a standout as the head butler Mr. Hudson, as is Eileen Watkins as Rose.  The only weak episode of the entire season is &#34;The Swedish Tiger.&#34;  On the other hand, I'd be hard pressed to pick the best, with so many contenders!  &#34;I Dies for Love,&#34; &#34;A Cry for Help,&#34; &#34;The Mistress and the Maids,&#34; and the last two episodes -- &#34;The Key of the Door&#34; and &#34;For Love of Love&#34; are among my favorites.
B000FC130E|3.0|This book was good. Just not as good as I was expecting. The plot just didn't pull me or allow me to sink into it. It was mildly entertaining.
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this series!  It's smart, funny, exciting and always surprising.  The only downside the the length of time between seasons.
B0062QRTKA|2.0|i downloaded for my Toshiba excite and Works a few times after that the game crash and don't work anymore.. so i uninstall and left to the oblivion!! jaja :P
B0064MGU98|5.0|It parallels US trends and showcases in personal, intimate ways how our politics and business faces good times and bad. I especially liked the view from the woman's point of view.
0525478817|5.0|Realistic account of teen-agers with cancer:  the angst, fears and emotions.<br />Interesting reading but not a glossy, feel good story.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have watched my neighbor boy enjoy playing Minecraft.  It has kept him challenged, yet he enjoys the game and does not get frustrated.
B007WFTFG6|4.0|the only problem with this app is that i have to put my phone in airplane mode because of all the ads. she clicks on them, they screw up the game, then she cries & i have to fix it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Very captivating! This was a very fun and interesting read. I can't wait to read the rest of the series!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am enjoying this game very much. Makes you think unlike ball popping, and fruit switching games. There have been times where I have wanted to cheat and Google some clues, but I have stuck through and found my own way. I'll be looking for more game like this.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It is exciting, and keeps you in suspense. Has all the qualities of a great show, romance, politics and great story lines.
B0064W639K|4.0|This story arc is a classic. The art work is not only amazing (especially when compared to Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Strikes Again) but is now iconic Batman lore. My main gripe with the story, it starts out so strong, then goes on and on and on. I can tell how much I love a graphic novel when I can put it down, and I started reading TLH (The Long Halloween) and got 40-50% done, and didn't return to it for about 2 weeks. However, it does pick up at the end (which is an amazing twist ending). Overall, Im glad I read it, and ecstatic that I was able t enjoy the beautiful art work. If you are a Bat-fanatic its a no brainer you must read TLH, if you are a graphic novel fan this is a must read, if you are just getting into graphic novels and you want to start with TLH, stop, collaborate and listen....start with  The Killing Joke, it is iconic, intense, and short.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book starts out exciting taking you along with the characters each step and its a seamless effort. The characters are bold and loud real and relative can't wait to read the next .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's the awesomest game it's so cool and you can go and explore new places it's so awesome you should purchase/buy it
B00ANDDBBE|5.0|The second full season I've seen of my favorite Doctor, & it is his best.  I'm not sure how Series 2 could top it (I've only seen the first 5 episodes, but apart from the werewolf one they all ranged from good to perfect).  Here's a review of the episodes with synopsizes from the booklet.  Just remember, SPOILERS!<br /><br />Voyage of the Damned:  A spacecraft set on an apocalyptic collision course with Earth, a hostof killer robot angels and an evil mastermind - it's just another Christmas for the Doctor.  This is an episode that starts off good, but then gets stupid with the senseless sacrifice of Astrid (she could have easily jumped off the forklift).  The worst part was when the writers had a chance to bring her back in a reasonable & forgivable fashion but then they botch that too.  C<br /><br />Partners In Crime:  Donna is determined to find the Doctor again - even if it means braving the villainous Miss Foster and her hordes of sinister Adipose.  A truly great reunion episode.  A+<br /><br />Fires of Pompeii:  Psychic powers and stone beasts run riot in old Pompeii, but can Donna dare the Doctor to change established history?  This is another great episode, with an interesting story & an awesome monster. A+<br /><br />Planet of the Ood:  The Doctor takes Donna to her first alien world - but the Ood-Sphere reveals some terrible truths about the Human Race.  This is good, but a bit too preachy at times.  B<br /><br />The Sontaran Strategem/The Poison Sky:  Martha Jones summons the Doctor back to modern-day Earth, but an old enemy lies in wait.  This isn't the best 2 parter I've seen, but not the worst.  While it's not very good, for every stupid moment there is a genuinely good moment, so it could have been worse.  C<br /><br />The Doctor's Daughter:  On the planet Messaline, in the middle of an endless war, the Doctor meets the most important woman of his life.  The beginning felt rushed just so we could get to the title drop, but everything after that is excellent.  A<br /><br />The Unicorn And the Wasp:  In 1926, Agatha Christie disappeared for 10 days.  Was it amnesia?  A nervous breakdown?  Or a giant alien wasp?  This is a funny, intriguing all-around wonderful mystery episode.  A+<br /><br />Silence In the Library/Forest of the Dead:  The Doctor & Donna enter a world of terror inside an abandoned library.  They're given only one warning: \\"Count the shadows.\\"  To survive, they must forge an alliance with the mysterious River Song.  This is the Blink of 2-part  New Who stories; a story that is absolutely perfect.  Okay, as close to perfect as you can get, since there was one little bit I didn't like towards the end.  But the rest is pure excellence.  A+<br /><br />Midnight:  The Doctor is trapped, powerless and terrified, on the planet Midnight, as the knocking on the wall begins...  A great, scary episode.  A-<br /><br />Turn Left:  As Donna's world collapses, she finds help from a mysterious blonde woman - but can Donna & Rose stop the approaching Darkness?  The set-up was a little contrived, but the rest of this episode was excellent.  I'll never complain about the deaths in Doctor Who again!  A<br /><br />The Stolen Earth/Journey's End:  Earth's greatest heroes assemble for battle when the return of an old foe threatens all of reality.  But a prophecy declares that one of them must die...  A little frustrating at times in the second part, but it's worth it for the good stuff.  And after seeing this, I officially rank the third episode of series 5 (Victory of the Daleks) as thumbs down because this should have been the end of the Daleks.  The only real complaint is that I didn't like how the prophecy was fulfilled as it felt unfair, but at least we can hope that it will be fixed later.  But overall this was really good.  A+<br /><br />This is definitely one of my top 5 seasons of Doctor Who.  Good luck finding this at a good price.
B00C061HZY|4.0|I like Georgio's music...Cat People (highly recommended if you can find it) , etc.  This music takes me back to Disco...but in a good sense.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|After series 4 they decided to do a whole season just consisting of 5 specials.  I'm not sure why, but that allowed the producers to take their time making these, & it shows.  I loved every single one of these stories.  Here's a review of each episode with synopsizes from the booklet.  Just be on the lookout for spoilers.<br /><br />The Next Doctor:  Christmas 1851, and Cybermen stalk Victorian London.  The Doctor discovers a spate of mysterious deaths, and he's surprised to meet another Doctor!  Are two Doctors enough to stop the rise of the Cyberking?  When your biggest complaint is that the Cybermen are sexist (in choosing a woman to become their Cyberking) you know it's an excellent episode.  Even though we all know by now that David Morrissey wasn't the next Doctor, I think he would have made a good Doctor.  And I like any story with the Cybermen in it.  Remember, they were assimilating people even before Captain Kirk was around.  A+<br /><br />Planet of the Dead:  When a London bus takes a detour to an alien world, the Doctor must join forces with the extraordinary Lady Christina.  But the mysterious planet holds terrifying secrets and time is running out as the deadly Swarm gets closer... This was another excellent episode.  I didn't like the ending where he helped the thief escape (though I loved the Doctor's line \\"I'm going to step into this police box and arrest myself.\\"), but just stop after he's told about his death & you have a perfect episode.  A+<br /><br />Waters of Mars:  Mars, 2059.  Bowie Base One.  Last recorded message:  \\"Don't drink the water.  Don't even touch it.  Not one drop.\\"  This was a surprisingly powerful episode.  A+<br /><br />The End of Time:  On Christmas Eve the Doctor is reunited with Wilf (Donna's grandfather), to face the return of an old enemy.  But the Master pales in comparison to the greatest threat of all - the return of the Time Lords!  This is the best regeneration story I've seen, apart from possibly the Caves of Androzani.  A couple nitpicks though.  The Doctor's tantrum at having to die when he struggles to decide whether to save Wilf or not was out of character for me, & as usual I hated the bit with Captain Jack, but apart from those 2 scenes this was perfect.  The story was interesting & epic.  We learn why the Master has been crazy all this time & we get a good end to his story.  The scenes of the Doctor visiting his companions were all wonderful, except for the aforementioned scene with Captain Jack.  The Ood singing the Doctor to sleep was one of the saddest, most beautiful things I've ever seen on television.  And of course to top it all off the Eleventh Doctor gets a great entrance.  All in all this is really good.  A+<br /><br />Farewell David Tennant.  You were truly the greatest Doctor.  Matt Smith is doing his part in following in your footsteps; it's just that he needs better stories to go along with his great acting.  Here's hoping Series 7 gets back to the quality of the first 5 series after Amy & Rory leave.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|Pretty fun. Seems to have all the answers which means it can be difficult to stump it thus the challenge ends quickly.
1451695195|5.0|This book showed us that someone with doubts can be reached in a logical way with rational explanations proving the reality of a relationship with God.
B001UG56ES|4.0|Had seen this before but I enjoyed it as much this time. It is a long movie but really holds your interest Action and Love! The women is the hero!

B00F7YHDWC|4.0|i have been waiting for this game to come out but there are a few problems. you cant keep the plane in the sky because you cant blow into mynkindle.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Gishams style of righting wrongs.  His story telling is realistic and the good guy wins the day.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Such a brilliant game<br />Was a good game to play can spend hours playing it every one must try it out
B006ZZAMWK|3.0|My niece loves this cd. What was cool even though I don't like them I got access to the whole album digital on my amazon cloud. Thought that was cool
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I like the fact that you write and take notes. I also like the ability to highlight on the pages. So far, I haven't encountered any problems and I would recommend to anybody.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a great book. Reads so much like a real biography instead of the typical bud/s books I have read. What a guy he was.  Interesting life and hardship but what a hero.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|The story behind this album can be found anywhere on the internet, not such a hard endeavor. Thus I will save the details.<br /><br />This album represents both Ronnie's and Black Sabbath's intellectual essence. An unlikely mix with heavenly results. The combination is perfect; Ronnie’s powerful, iconic voice and epic writing, Tony's thunderous riffing, Geezer's titanic bass and Bill Ward's musical intellect; It's all here.<br /><br />Heaven and Hell may very well be, musically speaking, the best song ever recorded by Black Sabbath. It may not follow the “original” approach or style, but such is no reason or excuse to discard its brilliance. After all, it’s all about breaking styles and setting one’s own.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Good book, fast read. Read it after I saw the series on NETFLIX, which by the way way excellant. Good insight into the real Piper Kerman.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I use this app literally EVERY day.. lol, somehow.. love it. Most people have it these days.. it comes in quite handy.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Dissapointing! I LOVED this app and so did my children. I used it often. Yes it crashed occasionally but that i can get over. However, when you pay for 5 or 6 puzzle packs &amp; then a few months later they take them back, they should refund your money right?!? I will never buy another puzzle pack again!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|The part when 5 Phantoms singing together totally blew my mind.  Watch that part many many times over.  Love it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I absolutely love the look of the clocks.  The digital glows a beautiful blue.  The alarm works nicely. The sleep timer is a nice bonus.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Low expectations before I bought this DVD .  But it was great story.  Enjoyed it very much.  But music especially acting not as good as Phantom of Opera.
B000O76VBG|5.0|This teether toy has helped a lot especially now that his teething is peaking. I love the different sounds it plays as a distraction from the discomfort he gets while teething.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I really liked the book. Jack Reacher is such a good brother and friend. Always there to help everyone and has a great heart.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I really loved reading this book and gave me plenty to think about. Months after reading this book it's still in my thoughts and makes you look at the challenges that disabled people face.

B006GWO5NE|3.0|This item works but I have to take a fingernail clipper and tighten the piece so it will not move for it to charge the kindle.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The only bad thing about this incarnation of Holmes and Watson is that it is over too soon.  Both series of this wonderful version left me anxiously awaiting the next.  The writing is superb.  The acting is wonderful.  I am particularly struck by the authentic on-screen friendship between Cumberbatch and Freeman.  Moriarity is well portrayed as are the \\"supporting\\" players.  Mycroft is fantastic as is Irene.  If you haven't watched either series, you are in for a treat.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|5 stars, need I say more. I'm sure everyone has seen it and has says the same. Waiting for the sequel.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The second season was just as good as the first, if not better.  I'm truly enjoying this series--I'm truly hooked.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Good fun to watch. Has good character development and jumps deeper into the doctors mind than the classic series did.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|I gave this as a guift and the receiver loves it. I recommend it to anyone looking for something like this.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this clock for my Kindle Fire. Easy set up and all of the application are easy to view.
B006UIUJ2A|4.0|An unusual book which is quite gruesome.  One keeps reading in the hope that it will get brighter.  An extraordinary tale depicting a life and living in northern Korea under Communism.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's an ok game, I would like to see what the next room's will look like, and when to expect them.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman's Ocean transports you quite willingly into the unquestioningly fantastical world of the mind of a child. It is one of those books when 250 pages flies by too quickly, leaving you wanting more, like every great book should.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I bought this for my kids who absolutely adore the minions and the movies but I'm the one addicted! Easy to figure out and I can't put it down.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book!  It was one that I hated to put down and have recommended to more than one friend.  The story held my attention - I couldn't wait to get back to it everyday.  A really good read for those who love fantasy...and magic and illusion.  I'll read it again!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|BEST APP EVER I love this app beacuse of all the games you can play. Get this app you will not regret it
B002O2THVA|4.0|I saw this as a kid an again a couple times later in life  and it seems kind of timeless with many of the big stars of the day. I still liked it 20 years ago since I saw it last prior to watching it again on prime instant video recently. Even my wife like this even thought it is not a genre she generally takes to.
B004FHCH96|1.0|I ordered this and Fight Club, both 10th anniversary editions, both defective. A disappointing waste of money.<br /><br />There is a required word count on this review thing so ignore this.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|Not really much Explanation needed it takes place before the books and is closer to continuity than the movie everyone loves so well.
0385474547|1.0|One of the worst books ive ever read...o could not stay engaged what so ever and just their names alone were hard to keep track of
B00ET7EON4|5.0|Have enjoyed this band since their first album,  This seems to be their strongest, most consistent outing yet. Black Keys influence is strong, but in a good way.
037571457X|2.0|Good drawing but bad plot.there seemed to be no purpose or meaning to the story what so ever. Not recommended
B002RKSZS0|4.0|The book is good but it is not as great as Pride and Prejudice! The story is quite interesting though.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|A nice tale, I felt for the protaganist.  Liked the &#34;flashbacks&#34;, not too overdone.  At some points, it just took a long time in the telling.  I found myself peeking ahead to see if something was going to happen....all in all, not a bad read.  Just not going to take your breath away,
B008476HBM|5.0|The very best of jane systems work. I downloaded this copy because it was free as it seemed silly to pay for a copy when I own at least two hard copies.it is a fine copy.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like to play this on my phone.  I will buy some more skin packages to make it more fun.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I don't care if it's pro or not I still love it because I had 1 piece of dirt and turned it into unlimited diamonds.
B00F91H666|5.0|Great movie no stop action.  Watched this on the ipad during a flight gy next to thought it was pretty good too!!!
B00BNPI7VU|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down. These two cats are so funny and remind me a lot of my own cats. I have everyone of his books on my kindle from the first one he published. I can hardly wait for the next one.
B00DL7TSAM|5.0|A wonderful and awesome item - Number Ones (The Collectors Edition). 7&#34; format booklet, special coloured CD for the 10th Anniversary of &#34;Number Ones&#34;.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|What a truly surprising, entertaining, engrossing movie..... This one had me fooled from the beginning.  The actors were well cast and characters truly enjoyable to watch.  I have always been a fan of magic and magicians; this was great to watch!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Awesome Movie.  I love the new Star Trek movies. There is enough old school nostalgia to satisfy the die hard trekies but the new story line breaths fresh life into the series.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I just finished reading this book again and the writing, characters and story make for an unforgettable book.  I also love the reverse story [[ASIN:1492320773 White Fang]] and will look to read that one next.  This author truly stands the test of time with his writing.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the puzzles! it is challenging and fun without being too hard! cant wait for more puzzles :) great game.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|It's Indiana Jones!  What do I need to say more?  It was an addition to my library and am glad I got it!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|this book is so long.  normally i like long books as long as they captivate me.  if the story is great, i'll devour a long book like this in no time.  but this is not necessarily the case for game of thrones.  each reader will have his/her favorite and least favorite characters, so it is natural for me to come upon a Dany chapter and dread moving ahead, putting the book down for a good week or so, but i love jon and bran chapters, so i read those willingly and on the spot.  there are so many &#34;chapter (POV) characters&#34; in this book that i find myself doing that more and more than in other books.  &#34;oh, another tyrion chapter? he's been boring lately, i'm gonna stop for a month...&#34;  basically it's just taking forever to read this one.  at times it's a wonderful read (and the action throughout is far more enjoyable than it was in A Feast for Crows), but other times is actually feels like work...and that's not how i like to feel when i'm reading for pleasure.<br /><br />still. i do like the book a lot overall.
B006ZCWU5K|1.0|I can't believe how politics have blended into the music scene and ruined my image of the artist.  Never will I buy Springsteen again!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|first off, cersei lannister is by far my least favorite main character in this series, so i was disappointed that SO MUCH of this book is written from her perspective. i hate her as a character, so i really hated being in her head.<br /><br />that and the book centers around King's Landing and its principal characters, which make the read pretty slow. there's just not that much action compared to the 2nd half of A Storm of Swords...wow... Storm of Swords...THAT was a good read.  by comparison, this one is plodding and at times difficult to continue. but, it's still game of thrones and still good and you need to read it in order to continue the series, so you should.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|i love the characters, everyone of them.  it is a great ensemble cast with great storylines.  even though you know in general where things are going, it is a pleasure getting there!
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Interesting commentary regarding human evolution and great descriptions of races.  Certainly made me want to go out for a run, but interesting even for non runners.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Well acted movie.  Interesting slice of life character study.  Little romance, little mystery, little action.  Not a must see but not a waste of time.  Thoughtful.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I really dug this movie, and the scale with which they used their magic was totally unbelievable, however, this is a movie, so I totally enjoyed it!  Four magicians coming together under orders to become THE FOUR HORSEMEN and being backed by Michael Caine's character to keep magic alive, well, I took to it.  What I didn't suspect was how these magicians would betray him.  WHAT???  Now, here's Morgan Freeman's character, debunking them and tracking them to expose them.  Problem, there is someone else pulling the strings.  Someone on the inside.  Again....WHAT???  This movie grabbed me and my brother thinks that there will be a sequel.  I don't.  I think that the story will end here, however, this is Hollywood, so.......
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|Wow, it's a shame with the cast line up how slow and boring this movie ...watched the movie in 3 parts could not keep my attention to watch in full... figured I paid the money and maybe the ending would surprise me, Wrong!!!... big disappointment all around... bottom line: a lot of flash, special effects and a flimsy plot... for a movie about magic ... I'm the one who feels ticked, swindled and cheated out my 4 bucks ... refund please!!!
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I have to admit, my brother wanted me to see this for the longest, and I pushed it to the back of my mind, cause I didn't think that it was going to be worth the bother to watch.  Now, I was so wrong...this was a very good movie and I loved it!  Just when I thought that it was over, it wasn't.  It kept the story moving until the very end.  Matthew is a very good actor, and after his first movie, I thought that his career was going to be a lark...WRONG!!!  I think I may need to check out more of his flicks, especially if they are as entertaining as this one.  WAY TO GO!!!
B008Y6ZTKS|5.0|Great family movie, inspirational.  And based on a true story, wow!!  Will share it with friends and family for a lifetime.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I wish the game had more upgrades to get and you should be able to customize you vehicle like paint and body work
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I am a fan of zombie and rage virus movies. I read the book, though it has been over five years. The pacing of this movie was slow and there was not enough suspense to keep the viewer engaged. I did not have high expectations after seeing the trailer for the movie, it seemed like it would be another horrible adaptation of a good book. I would like to split this review into two parts, positives (or things that did not seem bad or stupid) and cons (things that did not make sense).<br />Pros<br />1) Protagonist is a former member of the UN armed forces. Yes the UN does not have teeth and is not a well respected military force. However they do have a military force, it is made up of volunteers from the military of member countries. So no I do not think it stupid that the protagonist was a former member of the UN. He was most likely in the US military and then volunteered. He also was likely in vary dangerous combat areas along side US military, he had to have been trained in combat,<br />2) It is not strange to look for patient zero, and to look for a cure. It was identified as a virus of some sort so trying to find its origins makes sense.<br />3) The scene in Israel, I thought was done well and was the closets thing to the book that I can remember. No the zombies did not get smarter. They were dormant. There was not enough noise next to the wall to get them to think there were none-contaminated people on the other side. When the girl started singing and the other people started to join in. All the zombies awakened and rushed. They got lucky in that a good number rushed one area piled on to each other and were able to climb over the wall.<br />4) Him and the Israeli soldier survived the plane crash. He was horribly injured which would likely happen.<br />5) Using H1N1 to as camouflage  was pretty neat. Considering the closets things to zombies we have so far is a fungus that infects certain ants controls them so that it can spread but it tries to only spread to healthhosts.<br />5) The kids, acted realistically, one was scared to the point of silence the other to annoying cries. The hispanic kid  was important in that it showed Brad Pitts character wanting to help those who helped him. That kids was either very lucky or terminally ill.<br />Cons.<br />1) That the doctor brought to South Korea died so early on.<br />2) The change from Russia is a black hole to India is a black hole was annoying.<br />3) The length of time it took for the back of the plane to become infected and break out into chaos. The virus takes seconds to show signs and 10-12 seconds to complete the transformation. Unless for some reason the dog was the carrier it would have been known within seconds that one of the passengers was infected.  Not the hours it would take to go from Israel to Cardiff.<br />4) The teeth thing the zombies do.<br />5) I understand making one look terminally ill, but it would be hard to travel long distance while sick with H1N1 , unless they found a way to make your body show signs of being terminally ill without actually being terminally ill.<br />6) Why did ingestion of the zombie blood not infect Brad Pitts character?<br />7) Pacing was bad, not enough character development, not enough suspense.  Action scenes okay but could have been done better.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent !<br />I sucked on ice cubes while I was reading this book to stay calm.  Of course, it was summertime in the South, but don't think that had too much to do with me getting 'flushed'.<br />I thought my Kindle was going to melt!<br />Great read.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|action packed, did not drag on, was not slow to start, got right to the point.  great movie, loved it.
B000P407K4|5.0|After so many years, a few great movies still stand up.  Hilarious and frightening.  Peter Sellers was one of the greatest actors ever.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book kept me interested until after the end! Just when you think the book is over, you are in for yet another surprise. I immediately ordered another Liane Moriarty novel. I hope the rest of her books are equally as spellbinding!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I enjoy this game and it is very addictive. The only problem is that when I go to get on, it always says that I cannot play. Still fun when I had it though.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|Very good user guide. Provides information to get you started for basic projects. Very good details for rpi optional configurations. I'm new to rpi and this guide provides everything I need to get started.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I used to spend an hour or so each night playing this app.  It helped me to relax and I had so much fun with the beautiful puzzles.  Then you updated it and changed the puzzle pieces!  The puzzle pieces are now funny and not like \\"real\\" puzzle pieces.  I spent money getting all the new puzzles and enjoyed them Until your update.  I can not stand the new pieces.  I will no longer use this app.  It's now terrible, I can not stand it any longer.  To bad you changed it.
0385523394|5.0|Nothing like you would ever expect it to be!!!! Such a great book, I never wanted to put it down!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great book. Historic accuracy. Recreates he first half of the 20th century very well. Wars, fall of the aristocracy, the rise of the worker class
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I missed this book when I was young.  It is very good.  Things have sure changed in our idea of what kind of behavior is expected of unmarried girls.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Recent changes in the app make it nearly unusable. It used to show how much of a song from my cloud player was downloaded so to avoid buffering issues I could pause the song until 1/4 or so was downloaded then begin playing. Now with no download status it's just blind guessing.<br />Additionally, I can no longer skip back a small amount to listen to part of the song again. When I try now, it skips back to the beginning of the song so I have to listen to the whole song again. It's like a super cheap MP3 player. I pay for cloud storage to listen to songs on the go, but the app now makes it difficult.
B004PE0SR2|5.0|The Movie speaks for itself ... Dont want to give any information that may spoil the movie for you... so enjoy
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love it, easy to play and get into. The dragons are so cute. Really like the game. Some of the colors are a bit much. But if you like decorating and  gigapets this is probably a good app for you. And it is free.<br /><br />cute
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This is a great app. It is like 7 calculators in one. Definitely cheaper and more handy than carrying all of them too...
B00F35B8F8|4.0|It was funny seeing the tie-ins/references to the original Star Trek movies and the role reversals with Kirk and Spock.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent book,  a fun read. This book is to the point, scientific without being dry or boring. It is inspiring and guides the reader gently to draw their own conclusions. I highly recommend it to anyone who is curious.
B00F91G5BS|4.0|First of all this film has nothing in common with the book by the same name other than the name of the protagonist and the zombies.  Note the book is called World War Z not Brad Pitt's Zombie movie.  It really is Brad Pitt's Zombie movie and unless they actually complete a sequel and have at least one scene from the book they should just abandon the whole World War Z premise altogether.  Having said all that I loved this movie.  I saw the rated cut version in the theatre and enjoyed it as well as it was completely new material bearing absolutely no relationship to the book I had just read.  Now it's been months since I've seen that theatrical release but if my memory is correct, and it probably isn't, I don't recall the final few minutes being in the original.  Those minutes showing the battle in Moscow.  Those who read the book know what I mean.  And that was a nod to the book and a promise to create a sequel which may, if it's a trilogy, make what they did in this novel perfectly appropriate in its vision.  I love me some zombies and this franchise is a totally different take on the genre.  The rule of thumb in the genre is that humans lose.  They spend the movie trying to survive only to find out survival is impossible.  In World War Z the message is the opposite.  We are nearly defeated but like in Independence Day we ultimately survive.  How this franchise gets us there will ultimately determine whether it's World War Z or Brad Pitt's Zombie Trilogy.<br /><br />Now that we went there, for fans of the genre, wasn't it just a bit of stolen thunder that the director chose Philadelphia as the place from which the story begins (sorry directors, I95 has never been that empty of traffic) considering Justin Cronin's &#34;Passage&#34; Trilogy is slated for filming and one of the best, most important, scenes in the Passage is the outbreak in Philly.  At least the director of WWZ didn't use 30th Street, that would have been too cheesie.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book encompasses the connectedness of all.  Time is fluid.  Values remain.  Archtypes of Woman, the maiden the mother, and the crone are in this book.  Through them there is salvation from evil.
0439023483|5.0|I was skeptical about reading this book with all the hype. However, it really is a quick read and the perspective and stylistic approach Collins has for this first book is rather intriguing. It is also interesting to see the direction the films have taken the style from the book and have run on a tangent that is much different than the way Collins writes her characters. However, I will say the character in the book for Woody Harrelson has much more depth.
B00DLKXF3A|5.0|I love avenged sevenfold. I've been a fan ever since I've heard the first album. It seems to me like they continually progress as a band and if u like any of their previous albums you will love this one.
B003ARSYOO|5.0|I had not seen this movie in years and I am so happy that it is out on BluRay, now I can enjoy it with my daughter.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|This is one of our favorite books. It was a pleasure getting to read it on the kindle. It was convenient and very good.
B00338CMTI|4.0|I am not that far into the second book yet, but I must say that I really am enjoying it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was exactly as described. It works very well.  Thank you.  Very reasonably priced too. I will continue to use this!  Amazon is a pleasure to work with.
0740745271|5.0|This book brings fun to exercises for the eye - I get a thrill each time I can discern the hidden images.  Bravo!
B0026S93C0|5.0|cheesy lines.  great body movement definitely a must to watch with all your other dance dance dance movies.  Great starter for the dance marathon.<br /> weekend.
B000SEFM6K|5.0|I decided to read this book because it comes is referred to in The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield as a favorite book of the characters.  Since I enjoyed that book so much, I thought I give this one a try.  I love this book!  Wonderful character development and both likeable and hideous characters.  The descriptions of people and places is so much more complete than newer novels.  The book is long - maybe because of the detailed descriptions of places and events...it keeps going and going, but it is so worth the ride.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I love Doctor Who! Excellent show to watch with anyone. Highly recomended if you love aliens and a good laugh.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|This is a ghost story...or is it?  Very good character development and a great read.  I really cared about the characters and was totally taken in by the story.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Absolutely amazing! Best horror show ever made! It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Loved it!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I can't say I've ever read a book quite like this. I actually slowed down reading it to make it last longer. Never done that before! You root for the guy and NASA the whole time. If your unsure, just get a sample. You'll get the rest!
B008AX1HD8|2.0|Strange and unsatisfactory ending. The book rambled on and it was difficult to feel any attachment to the main character.
B00EDCIEU4|5.0|Excellent album!  Diverse, but has so many favorites its a pure pleasure to listen to the entire list all at the same time.  Rarely happens, so this is a real treat!  I dare anyone not to sing along and/or dance when these songs play.
B001AFF25W|3.0|Did learn anything I didn't already know, but it was a huge motivator for me to get my act together.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just about everyone has seen the film.  The reading is very good and it's the type of book you lend to your friends for the weekend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fantastic and just addictive! I can't get enough of these cute minions! Challenging at times...but definitely entertaining!!! :)
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I first stumbled across this song while listening to some online streaming radio. I heard one of the songs and I immediately wrote it down and when I got a chance I checked out some of the samples here on Amazon. After Listening to a few I decided what the heck and I purchased the entire album. I was definitely not disappointed . The songs all convey a true sense of emotion and thought in their creation. I never get tired of listening to it.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|One of the best books I have read in many a year. Some already consider it a classic, but, if not, then it should be. This wonderous novel should be on every pre-teen's and every adult's must-read list!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Update:  Item broke after 1.5 years of use.  I wasn't particularly delicate with it (despite below comment).  Downgrading to 4 stars.  First headset I've used in awhile.  Very comfortable, fits completely over the ear.  10 hours+ battery time.  Good bass and audio quality in general.  Not great but definitely good quality audio.  My friends say I sound a little more clear and it cuts out more background noise.  Dolby effect is pretty cool.  Directional audio is standard I would say.  Not much you can do with just two speakers.  Range is solid.  I can use it anywhere in my apartment, even through closed doors.  Has a lot of moving parts so I feel like I need to be delicate with it but construction quality seems high.  Ear pieces rotate parallel with the ground as well as the standard tilting perpendicular with the ground.  Can't really comment on the noise isolation but it seems good.
B00A285OOW|3.0|I compliment the author on a very imaginative plot, and an original take on what really happened to Richard III's two nephews, BUT there were times I felt very little was really happening in this story. Two much emphasis on the family, and not enough on the cataclysmic events which shaped the Plantagenet and Tudor dynasties.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is awesome!!!!! I love the movie and mostly the minons. The game has good variety and speed.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It's not cleverness or elitism that cause other reviewers to want give this book such poor reviews. The truth is that no one is lying when they say it is truly terrible.<br /><br />I, like many, ignored their reviews because I thought, \\"I'm not looking for Shakespeare. I'm looking for a light read to entertain me this weekend.\\" Nope. Even as a frivolous indulgence it's just dumb. So poorly written in every way.<br /><br />Most of the reviews of this book have better writing than the actual book. When people write that it's repetitive to the point of annoyance they are not exaggerating.<br /><br />So far what I find most annoying about this book is that she refers to her vagina as, \\"down there,\\" with \\"there\\" always being italicized. I'm tempting to list other issues as well, but they're pretty well covered in the other reviews.<br /><br />This is my first novel of this nature, but I can honestly say that it had no effect on me, \\"down there.\\" Oh my. Now I'm blushing, and my inner goddess is biting her bottom lip...<br /><br />Anyways, kudos to James for putting herself out there, and making almost as much as Mr. Grey on such a poorly written trilogy. I mean that as a sincere compliment because as terrible as it is she has found her tribe. There are plenty more people with better and worse writings who never take the chance. I do find the success that she has created for herself admirable.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|The amazing Travis Luedke let me know that Simon Okill was looking for some reviewers for Luna Sanguis.  I saw the cover (gorgeous cover!), heard vampires, hello, I'm all over it.<br /><br />I should have read the blurb closer first, I would have been in a different frame of mind. You guys know how I like to surprise myself by not reading blurbs. :) I did know that it was 1925, set in France.  I was good there.  I started reading and was confused.  A vampire?  With amnesia?  But then, I went back and read the blurb, put myself in a frame of mind more suitable for a little more serious reading, and I loved it.<br /><br />This one took me a little longer to get through.  (178 pages) Normally I can read 200 pages in a day, easily, BUT that is lighter reading.  Simon's style of writing is very poetic, more dramatic writing, and I had to slow down a bit to absorb it all.<br /><br />I would recommend this to the over 18 crowd who disdains the sparkly vampire (though I do love my sparkly vampires too), the people who want their original vampires back with the gore that vampires make you envision (see Lucien and his minions in this book). If you like your vampires to glitter, you might be like me and enjoy this too, I'm just saying, those who want the vampires to be the evil blood suckers that they once were, they will love this book.<br /><br />This is just so different from any other vampire book I have ever read.  The amnesia, dual personalities, the extreme fear, the nurse and Bonbon, it really was an amazing story.<br /><br />Thank you Simon for letting me read Luna Sanguis.  I really enjoyed it!  Since this is #1, I look forward to the next in the series.<br /><br />I received a copy of Luna Sanguis in exchange for an honest review.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|It was a fun review of this classic comic. Very violent and often in extreme slow-mo as well. Some great pyrotechnics, and FX in general.  Fun but definitely not for kids. Some sexual content. Almost felt like it was a set up for a serial, though way too violent for TV.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read...dark with twists and turns till the last word! Read the authors other two books,  Sharp Objects and Dark Places...Gone Girl was the better of them.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|Loved the characters, especially seemingly innocent yet potent young ladies.<br />However, the fight scenes became a little tedious.<br />What makes me want to read the next installment is the unexpected loss of main characters in a novel - that takes courage by the author, and I am drawn into wondering what he/she will have in store for me next.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was very well written. I did not see the ending coming at all. I thought it was going to be the complete opposite!!!!! I recommend this book to anyone who wants a real page turner.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|Did not load properly on my Kindle.  Was a waste of time to try to get it to load.  I'm usually very very happy with Amazon and the apps but not this one.
B008Y212PI|4.0|These puzzles are fun. Most are not real hard but some are very hard, so you get a good mix.  I find these puzzles addictive, so don't start unless you have time to play.
B00F9A903O|3.0|There needs to be some instructions on how to play certain aspects of the game.  Not willing to pay cash..that makes it too much like Farmville.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Love the game as do my kids but because of the store nature it's harder to get farther without purchasing coins and gems and no way around having &quot;invited friends&quot; to achieve some tasks
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|This is another great Steve McQueen movie that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat with great action.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|As described and does the job.  Ships fast.  I shop at Amazon for accessories like this all the time. Period
B00DTMCSO2|4.0|This is a very good app of a WWI aircraft to fly either in the cockpit or outside the plane.
B003AJKPL2|5.0|I never used a pitter before, but I've been buying some excellent olives from the farmers market and they don't come pitted, so . . . This thing works like a charm. Doesn't take much time, hasn't missed a pit yet, and seems to go through the dishwasher just fine.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Cast, characters and plots make it the best drama on television . I can't imagine it not being on at least one more season!
B004NS7120|2.0|I paid for the HD version and got a very fuzzy low quality playback of this movie. I will not be purchasing any more Amazon movies.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|The best pin ball game for the Kindle Fire.  Would recommend to download this game.  Very fun and entertaining, and excellent graphics.  GREAT game for any Star Wars fan.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I'm a big fan of Robot action films and shows, I grew up watching Japanese animation (Macross, Voltes V, Daimos). This was pure fun, don't go looking for deep and thought provoking story lines mixed with some action -- for those check out Seven Samurai or Yojimbo type stuffs.<br /><br />Seeing Gypsy Danger (no relation to Carlos Danger) with an Oil Tanker ready to use as a pummeling bat was priceless!<br /><br />Also reminded me of a campy film, Robot Jox, but this is 100 times better
B003UYUP58|5.0|I couldn't put it down!<br />The book gives the history of cancer from its first identification 4,600 years ago by the Egyptians. It also expplains the latest research and therapies.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|I missed all of season One on TV, so this really was necessary. But the thing I like most<br />is picking up subtle comments and issues that I would have missed.
B008PCVGKI|4.0|Important topic, well written. I've read and enjoyed the book Bad Science from the same author. So when this book came out I bought it at once, and I'm very happy that I did.
B009EJSUBY|5.0|At a bit more than two dollars per CD, it would be hard to go wrong.  Even if this was a set of piano classics by generic artists and unknown orchestras, it would still be more than worth the price.<br /><br />Instead, at this remarkable price, we get some of the world's best piano classics played by one of America's best known masters of the keyboard.  Not only that, we get a set of RCA \\"Red Seal\\" albums that were known for the quality of the reproduction.  The sound quality mandated by RCA for its' classical recordings is maintained throughout this set.<br /><br />On this set, Van Cliburn plays music by many of the best known composers for the piano and some music by lesser known (to me, at least) composers.  As such, this set would serve as an inexpensive  audition to the music of many different composers.  Even if there is an album or two that you simply can't tolerate, you'd be losing very little to simply junk those CDs and enjoy the remainder.<br /><br /> Even if they raised the price to four dollars per CD, I'd still consider this set to be a tremendous bargain.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Another excellent read from Kate Morton. Love her books and this one had me engrossed right to the end. Couldn't put it down!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I guess I  was expecting something more like Apple TV but even with that aside, the resolution is very poor and reading on line content can be difficult.  Was reviewing for teachers and it will just not work well enough for them.........
B001ED7C58|5.0|Most of the songs on here, are really fun and cool to listen to both in the car and at home, or at a party with friends. As I have said before, I feel that part of what the Twilight movies successful was the amazing soundtracks on all of them and this one is absolutely NO exception.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this little game. It's simple but the graphics are excellent and takes great advantage of my Kindal HD capabilities. I would recommend it to anyone, even a friend!
B0029O08WA|5.0|Well the CD is fantastic....every song has a great tune on it, and I can't even say I have a favorite. The music is what helped to make the movie excellent too! Worth it to buy!
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|The graphics are great, it's just challenging enough to pass the time with. Would recommend to anyone. Better than most I've gotten for my kindal.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I've been playing this on my laptop and tablet and I'm completely addicted to this game. Would suggest it to anyone who likes a simple game with fun rooms.
B008K9SG9K|2.0|I had heard a couple of their songs on the radio, but really \\"discovered\\" IMAGINE DRAGONS, on PBS one random night. I hesitated to buy \\"Night Visions\\" because of poor reviews on the quality of recording.  I went ahead and purchased since I am far from an audiophile.  Man.  These guys should sue their producer.  This album sounds like it was recorded under a pillow.  I LOVE their music, and was thoroughly impressed with their performance and sound on PBS.  But they sounded better on my 20-year-old television than on this CD.... That is just wrong. I am so sorry to say it, but I am returning this CD.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Definitely not the book but really how could it be.  Worth the watch, intense at times but not overly gory.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I hear about complaints that you cannot stream what you want, but, alas, you can with your wireless notebook. Stream what you like from a Google Chrome browser and for movies, just drag and drop what ye desire into a google chrome browser and enjoy ;)
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I received the Withings Pulse Wireless Activity Tracker a couple of weeks ago and started using it immediately. It does what it's advertised and can monitor my activity on mi iPhone, iPad and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 without any problem. It's a very good product and useful device. Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery !!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best and most interesting book series I've ever read an sad to seethe third book end. It's my third time reading the whole series since last year.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|This is the first game I've used on my Kindle. It was easy to understand what to do and fun figuring out how to get through the map of the city. I love the way the characters fall over when they are hit. This is great for figuring out angles and strategies. I love this game.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love period shows.  This takes place in<br />England in 1895, and it shows the lives of the common people at that time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 left me wishing January 2014 wasn't so far away to see episodes start for season 4!!!<br /><br />Go purchase season 3!
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Outstanding insight into an under reported and generally inaccessible region of the world. Definitely worth the read if you enjoy world cultures and human rights issues.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|After &#34;Rapture of the deep&#34; their last Album, I wondered if Deep Purple could deliver the goods to the standard they have set themselves over their many changes in line ups.<br />All I can say is each time I buy an album of yours, you guys seem to find something new and inspirational and down right Rocking.<br />This Album is no exception, Deep Purple are still on top of the game still delivering live and in the studio.<br />Lots of great playing and Singing by Gillan, Paice, Morse, Glover and Airey.<br />They have grown together musically and the pieces, all fit really well.<br />Very musical, very Rocking and Most Definitely Deep Purple.<br />Love it Guys, thank you!
886613578X|3.0|Would be 100% if it were spiral bound so that it would lay flat on my desk. I use this format and have it open all the time so that I can refer to it at a glance. The hard binding does not allow it to lay flat.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|good character build ups, engaging plot, waiting for next season to start,,,love the twists that are thrown in...fun an engaging
B00E0SX118|5.0|Family friendly and very funny.  My son and I love this movie!!!  We give this movie the croods five stars!!!
B000AP04OM|5.0|A special edition of a favorite movie for a gift. It has the special features to enhance the gift. It came promptly and we have not complaints about it. I would buy again from the seller.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I can see why some people were disappointed by this take on Gatsby, but I really liked it and think that it really captured exactly what the novel portrayed. I really enjoyed this movie and think the cast members were all perfect choices for their roles.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Fun game. I love hidden object games and this one kept my interest. Not too difficult to play. Good for beginners.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good story line that kept me interested to the end. Going back and forth between two worlds was a good twist.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|It's a good action movie but not as a zombie or scary movie. Worth a watch just not a buy.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|zombies? Come on get real! I can't believe I paid for it. Does Brad really need the money to stoop so low?
B00847KFDS|5.0|The songs bring back a lot of great memories. Great CD if you want to crank up loud, put the windows down and hit the road
B00BFTV09K|5.0|This is a real live horror story unfolding before us and a real eye opener.<br />Whilst Monsanto is one of the biggest culprits of the food industry, these guys are equally as corrupt and responsible for a lot of today's health issues.<br />This book guides you through the land mines of the food industry and educates one so that we, as consumers can make informed choices about food purchasing.<br />Salt, sugar, fat the book, can change lives for those that are ready to listen to the message.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Not a bad movie, it just didn't grab me. Plenty of stars, acting wasn't bad, writing wasn't bad, I just didn't feel involved in the story.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I invited an old friend over and we usually cannot decide on a movie because she prefers comedies, while I enjoy action.  This movie had it all!  When we saw the cast, it was a no-brainer; the movie would be good.  It certainly did not disappoint.  We are planning to see Red 2 at the theater this week because we like the first movie so much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The excellence keeps right on coming!  Joy and grief, animosity and changed attitudes are only the beginning.  The chasm between the aristocracy and the downstairs servants is growing more and more narrow as the group continue to grow into what can only be viewed as family.  Although the &#34;chain of command&#34; remains intact, the emotional connections both &#34;classes&#34; have for each other is palpable.  I am in love with this series and wish we in the US could see it in September along with those in the UK instead if waiting till January!!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This is a Holiday favorite and arrived before the expected arrival date.  I would highly recommend this CD especially if you like Rod Stewart as much as my wife does.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Poorly written dialog. Better with the Cold War than with terrorists. Not his best effort by far. It's too bad.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It is better than the free version but I don't like that I can play music from googl music as an alarm.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|Another fun movie from the Marvel franchise.  This is well acted and entertaining for all ages.  They have done a great job of integrating the stories.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|A woman in power finally speaks up about the gender issue, instead of trying hard to blend into a male dominated world.<br />This is the type of book that would prod me to go to a book club and discuss
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book doesn't grab your attention right away.  I gets better but a little far fetched as you get to the middle. Entertaining but not one of my favorites.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|I have reviewed my order and can't find anyplace where the dvd is identified as letterbox format.  would never have purchased a movie of this dynamic in letterbox.  I will be purchasing a new dvd at my local Costco to replace this one.  you should really identify the format a bit better for us.  I am very surprised about this.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I love this sequel so much more than the last one<br />but I think they should have more levels because I finished it in two days?!!!???!
B00009RDG9|5.0|One of Tommy Lee Jones best movies it was brought new so it was in plastic and sealed when it arrived . No remake the real movie . It did have a return label inside of box .
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Without giving away any portion of the overall plot, I wanted to share the best scene for me.  Uhura is about to deboard a shuttle and Abrams, without a single cutaway, pans from the top of the still-landing shuttle to the side where Uhura's standing at the doorway as the door opens downward and gently touches the planet surface.  Uhura walks down the steps and leaves the shuttle.  This scene was filmed perfectly in 3D.  There is so much computer graphic and live actor interaction and yet at the higher resolution and in 3D, there were absolutely no glitches giving away the technical makeup of the scene.  It leaves the viewer in the movie without them analyzing the faults.  I was really impressed on how well JJ Abrams used 3D in this movie.  The story is fantastic and you must watch \\"Star Trek: The Wrath of Kahn\\" and \\"Star Trek: The Original Series: Botany Bay\\" to get the full aspect of how Abrams' staff paid tribute yet blazed their own path in their new Star Trek timeline.
B00020JPI6|5.0|Nicely done new case the sound is great and I really enjoy the cd. I got it in three days .
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I took a chance and I want my 3 hours back.  It's one of those movies you think it's gotta get better because Tom Hanks is in it, but nope.  I don't get this movie as too many stories intertwine in such a way that you want to go home.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it!!!! I can't wait to read the next book!! To leave you hanging at the end is just exciting!
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Love the characters and the humor mixed in with some more  serious story line.  I have watched all three seasons.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I am planning on purchasing the hard copy so I can share this with other people...<br />after spending decades being symptomatic, I think I can finally get a handle on chronic illness !<br />I have a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, but after reading this and Terry Wahl M.D.'s book Minding My Mitochondira and Wheat Belly by Davis - I have a new perspective on the role of wheat gluten and carbs in my ailments.  Dietary cjamges to follow ASAP !<br />Easy to read and understand.  Should be required reading for every practitioner!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We are on the third season and still are enjoying Downton Abby. I started watching and my husband got hooked. So glad we have amazon prime.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Well done British mystery with a flawed investigator and a village full of suspects = It is beautifully and masterfully done!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My kids and I are having a fantastic time playing this game. We got it after the 2nd movie came out in July and are still playing it to this day. My kids are from 6 to 10 and all 3 can play but each find their own challenges within the game to keep their interest.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|A good laugh with some fun romance!! It was a good movie - I'd watch it again! And I love Cameron Diaz!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|It was a fun read after reading several very serious books for a book club. I even enjoyed it knowing most of what would happen from watching the TV series.
B000W965QW|4.0|Hornby gets inide a character's head like few writers are able.  I can sense my own confusion in trying to graduate from altruistic ideals (however shallow or inconsequential they are) to the reality of adulthood.  Facing your past and owning up to your decisions is difficult.  Some have the emotional intelligence to do so gracefully.  Others not so much. The walk thru memory lane by way of top5 lists was great, amusing and (being the nerd I am) prompted me to explore the items on the lists I wasn't familiar with.  Hornby nails it again.
B004QZ9P6K|4.0|I read this book just prior to going to Israel.  It provided me with some good information about the economy and the society. I was expecting to see many electric cars when I was in Israel, but I did not even see one.  I asked our tour guide about this and he said the concept failed because the cars were too expensive.  I guess even Israel can't break the oil habit.
B009NNMB70|5.0|I'm a 30 something year old directioner with no kids, and I loved this movie.  I found it really interesting to see how they first started and got to where they are today.  They are all very dedicated and their success is much deserved.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I am a late-comer to the series so I had to catch up on all the seasons over the past month.  It was on Hulu Plus!  It is funny, touching and sometimes downright exciting.  Love the entire cast.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game, very addictive. Only fault is it always stops around level twenty on my kindle fire.still for free it's well worth the download.
1400169178|5.0|I love this book! It's truly an outstanding book. I learned a ton from beginning to end and I glad I bought it.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|It is really fun and addictive<br />REALLY good game and people should really buy it  I rate it at five stars
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Just started with this game today and I am really enjoying it. :)  the only thing I have is that I wished I could zoom in some more to find some of the items.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|One of my favorites from Floyd....saw them live during this tour. Have on VHS tape....nice to see it on disk
B00846REIS|4.0|Can't wait to read the next book in this series...move over Shades of Gray....Crossfire series is just as sexy! Enjoyed
1594202273|5.0|This book reads like a novel but is filled with fascinating and frightening accounts of Americas nuclear weapons. A must read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and detailed. Me and my little cousins love taking turns playing this game fir hours.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A good light read when you don't have anything better to do!! Good when I can't sleep. Rather shallow characters.
1250007208|2.0|I am bearly reading it and its starting<br />to get interesting and i thik is going to be a good book
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I tried reading this book while riding the exercise bike, which led to a near accident with my first giggle fit, so I had to save it for when I could focus. There were so many laugh out loud moments compliments of Tina Fey's smart, self-deprecating sense of humor and just dealing with daily things (falling asleep in meetings, feeling terrible about job interviews, holidays with family where no one is completely satisfied). It is not so much a biography/memoir as it is a collection of essays (like David Sedaris' Me Talk pretty One Day, which I was reading at the same time). Highly recommended if you are a 30 Rock fan or just like smart, funny women.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Enjoyable book. A quick read because of its fast pace and short chapters. Some of the characters could have been developed further but I guess that is why it is a trilogy.
0316777722|4.0|I added this book to my list of books not to read while riding a stationary bike. The funny bits are so funny that I nearly fell off. David Sedaris' self-deprecating sense of humor in this collection absolutely shines. This was my first Sedaris book and I will definitely be checking out others.
B0059XTTW8|2.0|Very very hard to follow the story, plus the accents made it difficult as well. I think you would need to watch this 2-3 times to understand it. Good cast but ....
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Third book in the series and I loved it. At times too  much sex but overall a great story line to end the  series. Actually I could not put the book down. I even several nights got up when I couldn't sleep and read. Highly recommend reading the entire series starting with book one.  Go for  it!
B003JTHWJQ|1.0|Long Review Ahead, sorry. I'm pro-atheist, so should explain why the one star.<br /><br />Kindle Edition: TOC lacks page numbers and Chapter Titles; though each chapter's linked. Amazon Prime Members can borrow the book. I bought mine.<br /><br />So: pretend you're an atheist. Pretend further, you wish to account for being an atheist.  Even though, until YOU see proof God exists, you're right to be an atheist. So here in Amazon, are 2 books each for $8, by 2 atheists: David Berlinski's Devil's Delusion, which refutes Dawkins, and Dawkins' own God Delusion. Which better justifies an atheist position?  Hands-down, it's Berlinski's book, which I also reviewed as 'brainouty' in Youtube. The Berlinski $8 was the best I've spent.  God Delusion? Fracaso.<br /><br />For Dawkins writes like a 13-year old, ignorant and defensive. Belligerent, parroting stuff 'adults' say, no discernment, insecure. See his Preface to the Paperback Edition, via the 'Look Inside' option here in Amazon. He proves puerile in his first paragraph.  Why begin that preface with a need to badmouth reviewers who disagree with him?  Why rant even against atheists who disagree?  Is that how a 2nd preface, should begin?<br /><br />Where the humility, the corrections? For his 'scholarship' is abysmal, as others have long noted. Instead he launches into a tirade, from first paragraph. Dawkins' book goes downhill from there: a bundle of assertions heaped on prejudices, piled on rantings, all absent homework.<br /><br />(Peter Ruckman is a leader in the King James Only movement. Read his stuff, and you'll note an astonishing similarity of belligerent, defensive, ranting style.  Try his 'Bible Believers Bulletins' (read them online). If you want to be shocked, read the first few pages of Hitler's Mein Kampf. All 3 men are obsessed with praise, putting down critics.)<br /><br />So let's make more appropriate titles per Chapter in Dawkins' book.<br /><br />CHAPTER ONE (p.31, 'A deeply religious non-believer'), should be:  \\"Watch Me Name Drop Einstein and Sagan to make Me Look Good; Watch Me Conflate God with Religion\\" -- that's all his chapter 'achieves'.<br /><br />For if God exists, religion is NOT what God wants, but what man wants. Bible, for example, says Satan invented religion, in Genesis 3 (tempting the woman to make herself like God), Isaiah 45:7, 18-19, 'Pharisees, scribes, hypocrites!' verses, Hebrews 5:11-6:12, etc. God decrees evolution of some kind for fauna in Genesis 1:23-25.  So if Dawkins 'proves' evolution, then he 'proves' Bible right?  Didn't he notice that gaffe?<br /><br />Then he fatally maims his book, writing (page 41) 'In the rest of this book I am talking only about SUPERNATURAL gods...'  Does he know what 'supernatural' means?  ABOVE Nature. So NOT 'Nature'. So CREATING 'Nature'. Which, 'Nature' cannot prove, as Above nature is BEYOND nature, so 'nature' can't detect a SUPERnatural God.  (Dawkins later claims God is only God if NOT God, Chapter 4.)<br /><br />CHAPTER TWO (p.51, 'the God Hypothesis'), should be titled, 'Watch Me Flaunt My Prejudiced Ignorance of Old Testament, Google, and 'Watch Me transfer My Flaws, onto God'.<br /><br />Defense mechanism of projection, here.  No research into Bible's construction, scholarly analysis, nor any of 3000+ years' work available to Dawkins, was used to write this chapter. No, instead he spews his 13-year-old's ideas of God as Petty Judge (dour-God depiction to make adolescents behave).  He was schooled in infancy, he says. So, has an infant's ideas. Did he analyze passages?  No. Did he check the Hebrew and Greek to see if the translation was accurate?  No.<br /><br />What does he do, instead? Present irrelevancies: what Churchill, Waugh, Jefferson said (name dropping in lieu of solid argument); and oh -- let's swear like adolescents, proud of being old enough to get away with it, Dawkins quoting 'God is s***'.  What, he couldn't find a more useful quote?  Ironically, Paul uses that same word for religious works, in Greek of Philippians 3:8.  Dawkins doesn't know that.  Not good, to admit Bible is against religion.<br /><br />For useful info, is not Dawkins' goal. He rants, like Hitler. Is it scientific, to name drop and use swear words of famous people with nasty things to say re God?  Is that how a chapter on The God Hypothesis -- a scientific title -- should flow? Worse, Dawkins won't present the definition of God per Bible, yet claims to speak OF that God. Bad science: a scientist must first describe a target in its OWN terms, which requires doing his homework ON that target: here, Bible. Yet in Dawkins' later chapters, we'll see he never does his Bible homework.<br /><br />Yet Dawkins says (page 51), 'It is unfair to attack such an easy target.' So, he makes clear his motive is to ATTACK. Now, if you don't do your homework but hallucinate a victory, you'll think the target 'easy' to defeat. So is Dawkins is a true scientist?  No. So I don't fault him for atheism or nastiness;  rather, for dishonesty, not doing his homework.<br /><br />Compare how neatly the more erudite David Berlinski, explains The God Problem in his Devil's Delusion book (pp.34-38, 132ff): origins are postulated as 'God, Logic, or Nothing' (p.37, with pages 132ff devoted to that quote).  Berlinski concludes all three as 'inadequate' (ibid).  In a few sentences, he deftly shows why inadequate, from moral principle.<br /><br />Do you see Dawkins engage in the same rational discourse?  No.<br /><br />Rather, Dawkins' page 51 continues, quote: 'any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.'  So God is only God if He is not God, for 'god' can only be the END product of a gradually-evolved process that created him. Then God cannot be Supernatural, so A is never equal to A?  Ergo, W. V. Quine (who wrote Methods of Logic) -- would have to flunk Dawkins?<br /><br />Since the rest of Chapter 2 becomes seriously anti-Semitic (Monotheism section), replete with utter ignorance of the Old Testament -- Berlinski faulted Dawkins on that, too -- I'll skip the rest of Dawkins' Chapter Two.  For anti-Semites experience mental degeneration when talking about anything even indirectly related to the Jews.<br /><br />CHAPTER THREE (page 100, 'Arguments for God's Existence'), should be titled, 'Watch Me show I'm ignorant re Philosophy, Math, and the New Testament'. Aristotle, not Aquinas, talked about the Unmoved Mover. Yet Dawkins defaces himself further, proving no grasp of the arguments, to wit:<br /><br />1.  'Unmoved mover' is foundational to mathematics and cosmology, from which we get INFINITY (sideways 8 symbol) and the maxim, 'no information can be lost'; hence matter into energy, and vice versa. Mathematically, that means the largest UNcontainable set of ALL attributes (existence, deviation, variables, constants, sequence, potentialities, impossibilities) -- is UNMOVING. Stasis. Does Dawkins 'get' this?  No. He talks of regress and progress, which only apply to FINITY; which can only go on, if contained by the INfinite; so there is always room for finity to regress or progress.  Flunk Logic, again.<br /><br />2. and 3., Uncaused Cause and Cosmological Arguments are corollary to #1, which math proves. Dawkins also shows no grasp of the Law of Opposites reflected in math, physics, biology, nature:  if A then -A, all balancing to zero, hence STASIS, no info outside the Ultimate Set. So too, if the material exists, the immaterial must exist like math laws, themselves neither matter nor energy but acting on matter and energy.  So 'by indirections, find directions out'.<br /><br />So I'll skip his tirades on the remaining theological arguments.<br /><br />Next, his 'Argument from Scripture' section (starting on page 117).  Dawkins used kindergarten atheist websites, for his sources?  For he writes, 'the historical evidence that Jesus claimed any sort of Divine Status, is minimal'.  Really? Christ calls Himself Son of Man many times -- see my boring 'Son of Man' videos in Youtube showing them all in Bible -- it's a GOD Title in Daniel 7:13. Messiah=Christ in Greek, also a God title in Daniel: Messiah by definition is God-Man SAVIOR, hence the refrain in the NT that folks must believe IN 'Messiah'. Ooops.<br /><br />Christ was crucified, for claiming to BE Christ. For back then, Jews could appeal to Rome for crucifixion, only for blasphemy or a capital crime.  Dawkins might claim Bible books are much later than they are, as he can't read the Greek to know better. Yet just as Shakespeare today is obviously 500-year-old English, someone who reads Greek can tell how old and in what century or even what decade, Bible verses were written. The language changed that much and fast. We have a lot of Greek text outside Bible, for comparison.  But Dawkins didn't do his homework on textual-criticism facts, either.<br /><br />Worse (p.118): 'Ever since the 19th century, scholarly theologians have made an overwhelming case that the gospels are not reliable accounts'.  Really?  WHO?  J-boy Wellhausen?  He was joke, even then. Or the (sing Twilight Zone wooey-wooey here) Quellies?  Who would cut and paste valid Gospels we have, to concoct a shorter 'original' that never existed?  The Q folk are so daft, they don't even grasp 'incorporation by reference', a literary practice by which a later (Bible) book textually 'hooks back to' its predecessor, so we KNOW Matthew first, 2nd Luke, 3rd Mark, 4th John?  (See my Synoptics playlist, on that style.)<br /><br />Okay, what about other 1000s of Bible scholars in every denomination who tirelessly compiled, collated and corrected with 1000s of suddenly-FOUND Bible mss, so that for the first time, in the 19th century -- we had real PROOF Gospels and all other Bible books, were 98% the SAME text?  Even catching a kauTHesomai, a one-letter misspelling of kauCHesomai, the former not used until centuries post-Paul (1Cor13:3, Tischendorf THCH vs. A, B, and Byz texts)?<br /><br />Didn't Dawkins know, we can DATE CHANGES IN WORD USAGE even within 10 years, based on many Greek texts from SPQR back to Attica; i.e., Greek 'malista' from LXX, to Matthew to Luke and later Paul's writings, to Josephus and then Hadrian? So inter alia, we can prove Matthew wrote in 30's AD (see my 'malista' playlist in Youtube)?  So instead, the 'overwhelmingly case' is that Gospels are RELIABLE.  What was Dawkins smoking?  Aren't 'scientists' supposed to check their data beforehand?  Ooops.<br /><br />So when he decries 'religious agendas' (p.118), he instead proves to have his own.  Disregarding massive facts -- one of the biggest events in 1800's, proof of Bible accuracy -- is not scientific.  It's a shell game.<br /><br />So when Dawkins writes 'Luke screws up his dating' (p.118), Dawkins parrots kiddie atheists, again. He could have Googled to find how wrong his text would be, in advance: Jewish custom, you must register for taxes in your TRIBAL hometown;  HEROD collected taxes for Rome; but the year Jesus was born, Herod was dying, had Augustus as executor for the kingdom;  Quirinius, close friend of Augustus, was then in charge over the latter's grandson in Syria (the boy was in a garrison).  Dawkins didn't know Roman practice of ad-hoc titles for duties like tax collection, which a garrison in nearby Syria could readily support; nor did Dawkins know Luke 2:2's Greek 'hegemoneuontos' means (a participle, lit.) 'ruling', not strictly 'governor' as a fixed office. Acting officer gets same RANK to justify his ad-hoc duty;  that was required, in SPQR.<br /><br />So Quirinius was in Syria in 1 or 2BC.  We have a BC/AD dating issue, for a Catholic scribe cut off 3 years from Augustus' reign to create AD; so 2BC (end) is close enough, pending refinement. Dawkins didn't know this, either.<br /><br />Dawkins also didn't know end of Luke 1, Magnificat then Zecharias metered play ON Magnificat, both being Time Meters. Mary tells you WHEN she speaks. Jewish kids learned this syllable metering as a mnemonic game -- so to avoid carrying, heavy scrolls.  Meter begins with a dateline, first 7-syllable-factoring, and the style goes back to Psalm 90 (my Psalm 90 playlist shows that style also in Isaiah 53, Daniel 9; 'GGS 10-11' and Magnificat playlists show Mary's, Zecharias', Paul and John's Hebrew meters, yet Greek words).<br /><br />So Luke begins his Chap2 after quoting Mary and Zecharias. Every Greek reader would know the dates, esp. since Christ was prophesied to be born by the 1000th anniversary of David's Kingship START (since Adam; see my Genesis Epi.8c1ff videos and Psalm 90 playlist), on Chanukah (Haggai 2). Luke 1:26 and :36 tell you Gabriel came to Mary, in Adar. But Dawkins didn't know that, either.<br /><br />Now you might counter, 'brainout, Dawkins is no Bible expert'. Yeah, so whence his inept chutzpah?  I can prove all this stuff with only BibleWorks and good university sites. So why didn't he do even that homework?<br /><br />FLUNK Chapter 3.<br /><br />Alas, CHAPTER FOUR (p.137, 'Why There Almost Certainly Is No God'), is even more illogical and unstudied. Title it 'Watch Me reverse math and logic, so A never equals A, and I Refute Myself'.  He goes from arbitrary to baffling, to contradicting, to delusional, as follows.<br /><br />a.  He starts again with arbitrary, adolescent name-dropping, using Jefferson the DEIST, writer of our Declaration of Independence. America was founded as Freedom From Religion. 1000s of persecuted believers, Deists included, fled to the Colonies to be free of 'the priests';  Europe was largely Catholic, Calvinist, Anglican, all full of their own popes and pogroms. Jefferson, like most Founding Fathers, was into Masonic culture, an eclectic mix of 'all religions', including 'sacred geometry'.<br /><br />So ask: would you use a Deist to claim no God?  Would you AGAIN conflate God and religion, by quoting a Deist? How does that help your points?  For Deism says God DID IT ALL, then sits back and watches. Ooops.<br /><br />b.  Now the baffling fun begins. Having misused Jefferson, Dawkins next misappropriates Hoyle; Berlinski takes Dawkins to task for this, in Berlinski's Chapter 7 (of Devil's Delusion).  Watch how Dawkins refutes himself (page 137): 'This, in a nutshell, is the creationists' favorite argument' (that a hurricane going through a scrapyard can't build a Boeing 747, so life on earth didn't begin by chance)..'somebody who thinks natural selection is a theory of chance whereas -- IN THE RELEVANT SENSE OF CHANCE -- it is the opposite.'<br /><br />What is the opposite of 'chance'?  Well, in Roget's Thesaurus (Google on 'chance antonym'), 'opposite' (antonym) means 'designed', 'planned', 'foreseeable' and 'understood'.  Note all those antonymal terms require MIND. Minds design, Minds plan, Minds 'foresee', Minds 'understand'. Mindless nature doesn't see, design, plan, grasp anything, hence 'chance' belongs to 'nature'. But for Dawkins, Nature is the Planner, the All-Seeing Mind.  To Dawkins, OPPOSITE is somehow a 'relevant sense of chance' -- in what universe? It's no sense, and he makes no sense, either. See, he uses religious double-talk: Peace is War, Love is Hate, Big Brother Loves You.<br /><br />c.  So now adolescent, arbitrary, baffling confusion, becomes Contradicting.  For he writes: 'In fact, as I shall show in this chapter, Darwinian natural selection is the only known solution to the otherwise unanswerable riddle of where the information comes from. It turns out to be the God Hypothesis that tries to get something for nothing.'  Huh?<br /><br />Dawkins goes down the rabbit hole, for what did he claim earlier? 'I am only talking of SUPERnatural gods' (p.41) -- hello?  If God is SUPERnatural, then nature is subject to Him, not vice versa.  If God is SUPERnatural, He's NOT natural, so not matter nor energy, nor Time, nor even math, but Immaterial Infinite Mind Creating All -- just as Jefferson and other Deists stridently say.  Coming from NOTHING natural, is SUPERnatural God, Who Dawkins claims to refute?  Bible stresses SUPER.  Dawkins turns SUPER into SUB, then gets SMUG.<br /><br />So paired whoopsies -- Dawkins shoots himself in one foot via Jefferson; then in the other foot, by making God SUBnatural (take THAT, God)!  Voila, someone NATURAL (God) coming from something NATURAL (nature via natural selection, deus ex machina in Dawkins).  Yeah, God is but END PRODUCT of an evolutionary sequence (page 51).  Again, God is only God if He's NOT God!  So A never equals A!<br /><br />PT Barnum was right, and there is no joy in Mudville.<br /><br />d. So having adolescently, arbitrarily, bafflingly, Confusingly Contradicted himself, Dawkins now shows his Delusion, after 13 more pages of irrelevancies (name dropping and tirades), page 150:<br /><br /> 'In any case, even though genuinely irreducible complexity would wreck Darwin's theory if it were ever found, who is to say that it wouldn't wreck the intelligent design theory as well? Indeed, it already has wrecked the intelligent design theory, for, as I keep saying and will say again, however little we know about God, the one thing we can be sure of is that he would have to be very very complex and presumably irreducibly so!'<br /><br />Doesn't Dawkins see he shrank God to SUBnatural, so God is no longer God, so Dawkins invalidated his own thesis? Or is this more bamboozling double-talk to hide the gaffe...<br /><br />For irreducible complexity isn't key to the God question.  Key, is that we CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR ORIGINS any other way, whether simple or complex. A dishonest person will pick the wrong argument to mask the right one, which is WHAT CAUSED 'NATURAL SELECTION' to begin to exist?  If as Dawkins describes (and no evidence confirms), 'natural selection' is a mindless minded process of benevolent, incremental only-improving succession, HOW DID IT GET HERE?  No answer.  It just always was. Yeah? Yet it's illogical to conclude God birthed the thing, just as Genesis 1:23-25 decrees?<br /><br />Ahh, but Dawkins uses the non-sequitur of irreducible complexity, to mask his REDUCING God as subject to Nature.  Then having REDUCED God to that finite complexity, if life arises on earth NOT by chance, then God cannot arise by chance, as God is never God unless He's NOT God! Yay! Irreducible Obfuscation Complexity Complete (IOCC, io non vidi niente)!<br /><br />Yeah, Darwin posited a MINDLESS DESIGNER in 'natural selection', but of course there is zero evidence of such a minded mindless process, which magically 'selects' to improve. Fake Speciation Monster is Born, but we don't even get meat sauce.<br /><br />THINK: were Darwin's/Dawkin's FSM real, we'd have no death or disease, no mutations that in five successions routinely become cancers, etc. Else our 'natural selection' god is even more cruel than The Real One Dawkins Decries; Who at least, provides an afterlife 'with no more sorrow, no more tears' to make up for all the pain.<br /><br />Dawkins cannot prove that God does NOT exist. Even his title says 'almost certainly'.  Yet the 'god' he debunked, is NOT SuperNatural!  So he DIDN'T debunk God, at all. Ooops.<br /><br />Let's pass over Dawkins' ranting about 'gaps' (pp.151-161). He uses ad hominems, calling those who point out the problem of evolutionary gaps, 'worshipers'.  After he just worshiped 'natural selection' as a mindless yet benevolent 'god' for which/whom there is no evidence anywhere in any biological record past or present?<br /><br />Sigh: CHAPTER FIVE (p. 190, 'The Roots of Religion'), should be titled, 'Watch Me betray My Own Agenda, then Pretend it's God's'. Dawkins must again conflate God with religion, to mask the obvious flaw in his already-deficient, logic: WHERE DID THE AUTONOMIC PROCESS COME FROM?  See, his theme is that religion creates automatons.  Who, he intends to retrofit just as Lenin did, with a mindless nature needing to be extolled, as Darwin did in Origin of Species.  So the bell tolls.<br /><br />Oh, we won't notice, an autonomic process can never 'disprove' God or even render the idea of His Existence, unlikely.  Don't you automate things?  So why wouldn't God automate processes, Genesis 1:23-25? Oh, gotta hide the fact autonomic processes are but MIDDLE DATA; accounting for origins, not at all.  Santa Claus bringing home a newborn and telling the other children, 'the stork did it'. Finding 4 of 100 checks written from your checkbook, then claiming the other 96 are the same as, those 4.<br /><br />Yeah, a key gambit is to decry other religions, to replace them with one's own.  We dare not recall Hitler's 'master race', or how Lenin, Stalin, and later Mao, all used Darwin to advance atheism, force-feeding it to children. Hitler destroyed his millions, Stalin upwards of 30 million, Mao maybe twice that many, all in the name of The State, which Replaced Religion and thus became the new opiate everyone had to snort. Faster kill rate, than theistic religions.  Goose and gander...<br /><br />THAT is why it's so 'natural' to claim evolution true, why young people have trouble believing in God: 'evolution' was drilled into our baby minds over and over -- here, but more so to kids in Russia and China.  Carl Jung quipped, science is the new religion...<br /><br />Thinly veiled, too, for Dawkins labels Chapter Five's first section, 'The Darwinian Imperative'.  Yeah, Imperative.  Not, 'inquiry'.  Fahrenheit 451.  Not, hypothesis (as no evidence supports it). So it must BE imposed, on all us tykes from age 5 onward. Imprimatur.  Catholic.  The Only Answer.  If we take our Darwin Dummy Pills, we'll feel better (page 195). God forbid, another definition of 'evolution' might fit the data better.  Our Ford forbid, that string theory might better VERTICALLY account for the origins and variations in life (sudden OR slow) vs. those pesky horizontally-mutating genes; for strings might reveal underlying 'blueprints' in math formulas playing as fractals (sans need to invoke 'God', gaps or no). Oh, but all competition must be ruthlessly extirpated, just as Dawkins did in his Preface; dissenters are faith-heads, packed off to 'Siberia' to be 're-educated' by the smarmy peasants. Dawkins memes should alone rule supreme.<br /><br />Hitler, Stalin and Mao must be smiling down on Dawkins.  Or, grimacing up.<br /><br />CHAPTER SIX, (p.241 'Why Are We Good'), should be titled, 'Watch Me Deflect The Real Issue As I Cant Refute It'.  Here Dawkins again displays total ignorance of Bible.  Its #1 theme is that man is NOT good, so needs a Savior.  Again, the Real God is SUPERnatural, so all of nature's goodness, is not even in the same universe.  So there had to be a God-man, not merely a man, not merely God (man sinned, so in humanity sins must be SUPERnaturally paid).  Obvious, from Genesis 15:6, to Revelation 20.<br /><br />Worse: no amount of knowledge the woman in the Garden could get, would make her as good as God, even BEFORE sin (Genesis 3). For God is SUPERnatural, Unlimited.  So having cut God down to an END process of mindless magical nature, Dawkins must cut God down to 'good'.<br /><br />Which Bible refutes, naturlich. Romans 3:23 in New Testament, Isaiah 64:6 in Old, David's bad yet gets a Greater Son (2 Samuel 7 and Psalm 110:1, God-Man Messiah).  Else none of us could be born the first time.<br /><br />Now, intellectual sleight-of-hand demands substituting relevancy you cannot refute, with irrelevancy you can refute, ergo Chapter Six.  Even so, Christians who can't think properly, have long made this same argument, and response is required. Dawkins did it badly.  Berlinski did it well (pp.34-38 of Devil's Delusion).<br /><br />Yet note how The Real Issue is rather, WHY IS IT IMPORTANT 'to be good'?  Bible tells us we got that idea, from SIN. Adam didn't know what 'good' was. Satan tempted religiously, with a real tree's fruit (=doctrine) named Good-and-Evil (a hendiadys in Hebrew, two sides of a coin). Oh, she'd be AS GOOD as God if she ate it (magic). As a result, the urge to BE GOOD got into our DNA (Romans 5:12), and manifests religiously, starting with the itchy fig-leaves thingy.<br /><br />So we've been anal about being good, ever since. Even, religifying hair gel or 'oh, I'm a vegan'.  Everything is pitched in terms of you're a good person if you buy into it, and a bad person if you don't.<br /><br />So all those evils Bible depicts, the harsh rules under the Law, were to CURB the religifying impulse.  Sodom and Gomorrah was a mass raping, as the Bible story makes clear.  The Canaanites loved to skin people alive, rape, plunder, roast their own children in the arms of Baal/Chemosh/Molech/you-name-it, then have sex while the kids burned alive. So the right question to ask of God, is this:  why did He wait so LONG before wiping these people out?  Do you know, revenge was inculcated even into five year olds?  Many have rebutted Dawkins parroted accusations many times over the centuries.  Dawkins didn't do his homework here, either.<br /><br />Notice Berlinski, never argues in the same way.  He knows many of the arguments were properly rebutted years ago.  He did his homework.<br /><br />So now let's unmask The Real Issue.  The human post-sin mind, unlike animals, creates ABSTRACT 'good', is obsessive about it.  Animals must be TRAINED to have that idea. Many puppy-wetting newspaper sessions transpire, before the puppy knows he must 'hold it' to get Master's approval. That's not a natural value, in the wild.<br /><br />End Chapter Six, it just gets worse. SOS, same old stuff, long since eaten and regurgitated.<br /><br />CHAPTER SEVEN (page 265, 'The 'Good' Book and the Changing Moral Zeitgeist') is worse.  Should be Titled, 'Watch Me Flood You with my Bible ignorance.'  I guess Dawkins doesn't know the Zeitgeist crowd are repeatedly proven fake scholars (they make up 'evidence' ex nihilo like Gail Riplinger does): see labarum312 in Youtube, he's writing a new book on ZG you can buy here in Amazon?<br /><br />We already saw enough of Dawkins' ignorance, in Chapters 1-3, 6, but page 268 is a doozie: Dawkins writes 'God took a dim view of humans'.  So he didn't study the history of that time (2450 BC and up to 120 years prior), blithely ignoring that was one of the most violent times in history.  Per Bible there were only eight HUMANS left.  Everyone else, was a demon hybrid.  Dawkins of course also ignores the portion of the story we can prove, extra-Bible. So he doesn't notice the sexual prohibitions in the Law, were designed to curb a culture worldwide, of violent and rampant 'sex', even long after the Flood.  Oh well.  Maybe someday he'll do some ancient cultural history homework.<br /><br />So how scientific is it, to ignore the history, the cultural context?  Even were we explaining the Epic of Gilgamesh, we'd have to gauge that story in its own terms.<br /><br />So of course Dawkins finds the nuttiest, most apostate Christians' obsessions (i.e., with sex) and ascribes all their foibles, to God.  Dawkins treats these nutters as the True Voice of Christianity, for it suits his agenda. Then picks another nutter, Lot (who Bible uses to PROVE an idiot), as if GOD approved of rape? Thus Dawkins cherry-picks whatever he can spin, to blame it all on God.<br /><br />Yet all the stories of bad behavior in Bible show PEOPLE ARE NO GOOD, hence we need a Savior. Dawkins can't permit that clear meaning. Chapter ends with a kind of defense (page 308ff) re Hitler and Stalin, for only theists can be evil.  Hitler, like Dawkins, was born into a Catholic family. But oh no, Hitler cannot become an atheist invoking German Master Race as 'god'?  MASTER RACE was cornerstone for Nazism, newly re-founded ON Darwin. That doesn't make Darwinism untrue; but its abuse as a religious gambit, is real.<br /><br />And it's Dawkins' gambit, too: CHAPTER EIGHT (p.317, 'What's Wrong withReligion'), should be titled, 'Watch Me keep betraying My Real Goal of Replacing God with Darwin's Faith'. In taqqiyah, you play victim of an enemy you brand guilty of what YOU do. For Dawkins aims to SUBVERT SCIENCE to atheism.  That's why he won't do his Bible homework, and instead picked the wackos of Christianity in Chapter 7.  So here, he picks Prolifers and other nutters, to justify IGNORING Bible which contradicts him and them.<br /><br />As every Jew knows, Bible says fetus is not a legal person, Exodus 21:22 (see my Prolife Blasphemy videos for that and more verses). 'Human' isn't even biological, Genesis 2:7. So Dawkins needs to mask that, by using anti-Bible Prolifers, who like him, also claim 'human' is biological, so shriek 'abortion is murder'.  So Dawkins thinks he smears God and masks Bible's SOUL definition of 'man' (Gen 2:7), all the while reaming out the anti-Bible Prolifers as enemies to 'science'. Cute!  End Chapter Eight, no more value here.<br /><br />CHAPTER NINE (p.349, 'Childhood, Abuse, and the Escape From Religion') should be titled, 'Watch me replace My Brand of Abuse, for other religious kinds'.  No one wanted to escape from any atheist-controlled country like Russia, China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia?  When Dawkins talks of mental abuse (page 354) as criminal -- may we now sue him and his co-Darwinists, for the abuse we've suffered these last 150 years?  For Darwinism is but endless assertion, claiming we cannot SEE the past evidence, as it's too slow. So the difference between a God we can't see but can account for, vs. Dawkins' Flying Speciation Monster we can neither see nor account for.. is what?  Are the priests of Darwin gifted like the fake psychics who claim to 'see the other side'?  WE can't see it.  Glass houses, thrown stones, go both ways.<br /><br />For millions of kids have been INDOCTRINATED with these 'evolution' lies, too. Billions of dollars in wasted time, production costs; meeting hall rentals, endless refutations wash rinse repeat. Will Dawkins take responsibility for the fact no Darwinian has ever ONCE produced a shred of hard evidence?  Talk about scam artists;  this is worse than Piltdown Man.  If Dawkins were a woman and a Christian, his name would be Gail Riplinger.  She claimed 'visions' of the Titanic holes, proved the KJV infallible.  Dawkins claims visions too small in the past for us to see as 'holy', too.<br /><br />One last proof Dawkins is dishonest or inept:  page 378, and Chapter 10, re 'gaps'. Dawkins, who did no research into 'the gap theory' re Genesis 1, though there are many scholarly versions over the last 100 years -- Dawkins ignores all that, instead quotes an ignorant Christian saying Earth is 6000 years old. Live Hebrew refutation of that nutty idea is in my Genesis playlist, to prove Bible never says Earth is 6000 years old;  which I learned, forty years prior. So why didn't Dawkins know?<br /><br />So his CHAPTER TEN (p.388, 'A Much Needed Gap') should be titled, 'see My Gap in Scholarship' -- quipping his book fills a gap. Yeah, it does. Until reading it, I didn't fully see how irrational neo-Darwinism was: God is only God if He's not God, but evolved?  Wow. So I didn't know, how seriously in peril, objective science has become.  Now I know. Thank you, Mr. Dawkins.<br /><br />Berlinski already long refuted Dawkins 'evidence' claims, and so too did many others.  Daily.  Darwinists merely chirp 'Evolution is True Because Evolution is True', then 'conclude' their mere claim PROVES evolution true. Yeah, ex cathedra.  They're our new popes, now.  With ugly clay feet.ind Creating All -- just as Jefferson and other Deists stridently say.  Coming from NOTHING natural, is SUPERnatural God, Who Dawkins claims to refute?  Bible stresses SUPER.  Dawkins turns SUPER into SUB, then gets SMUG.<br /><br />So paired whoopsies -- Dawkins shoots himself in one foot via Jefferson; then in the other foot, by making God SUBnatural (take THAT, God)!  Voila, someone NATURAL (God) coming from something NATURAL (nature via natural selection, deus ex machina in Dawkins).  Yeah, God is but END PRODUCT of an evolutionary sequence (page 51).  Again, God is only God if He's NOT God!  So A never equals A!<br /><br />PT Barnum was right, and there is no joy in Mudville.<br /><br />d. So having adolescently, arbitrarily, bafflingly, Confusingly Contradicted himself, Dawkins now shows his Delusion, after 13 more pages of irrelevancies (name dropping and tirades), page 150:<br /><br /> 'In any case, even though genuinely irreducible complexity would wreck Darwin's theory if it were ever found, who is to say that it wouldn't wreck the intelligent design theory as well?

Then having REDUCED God to that finite complexity, if life arises on earth NOT by chance, then God cannot arise by chance, as God is never God unless He's NOT God! Yay! Irreducible Obfuscation Complexity Complete (IOCC, io non vidi niente)!<br /><br />Yeah, Darwin posited a MINDLESS DESIGNER in 'natural selection', but of course there is zero evidence of such a minded mindless process, which magically 'selects' to improve. Fake Speciation Monster is Born, but we don't even get meat sauce.<br /><br />THINK: were Darwin's/Dawkin's FSM real, we'd have no death or disease, no mutations that in five successions routinely become cancers, etc. Else our 'natural selection' god is even more cruel than The Real One Dawkins Decries; Who at least, provides an afterlife 'with no more sorrow, no more tears' to make up for all the pain.<br /><br />Dawkins cannot prove that God does NOT exist. Even his title says 'almost certainly'.  Yet the 'god' he debunked, is NOT SuperNatural!  So he DIDN'T debunk God, at all. Ooops.<br /><br />Let's pass over Dawkins' ranting about 'gaps' (pp.151-161). He uses ad hominems, calling those who point out the problem of evolutionary gaps, 'worshipers'.  After he just worshiped 'natural selection' as a mindless yet benevolent 'god' for which/whom there is no evidence anywhere in any biological record past or present?<br /><br />Sigh: CHAPTER FIVE (p. 190, 'The Roots of Religion'), should be titled, 'Watch Me betray My Own Agenda, then Pretend it's God's'. Dawkins must again conflate God with religion, to mask the obvious flaw in his already-deficient, logic: WHERE DID THE AUTONOMIC PROCESS COME FROM?  See, his theme is that religion creates automatons.  Who, he intends to retrofit just as Lenin did, with a mindless nature needing to be extolled, as Darwin did in Origin of Species.  So the bell tolls.<br /><br />Oh, we won't notice, an autonomic process can never 'disprove' God or even render the idea of His Existence, unlikely.  Don't you automate things?  So why wouldn't God automate processes, Genesis 1:23-25? Oh, gotta hide the fact autonomic processes are but MIDDLE DATA; accounting for origins, not at all.  Santa Claus bringing home a newborn and telling the other children, 'the stork did it'. Finding 4 of 100 checks written from your checkbook, then claiming the other 96 are the same as, those 4.<br /><br />Yeah, a key gambit is to decry other religions, to replace them with one's own.  We dare not recall Hitler's 'master race', or how Lenin, Stalin, and later Mao, all used Darwin to advance atheism, force-feeding it to children. Hitler destroyed his millions, Stalin upwards of 30 million, Mao maybe twice that many, all in the name of The State, which Replaced Religion and thus became the new opiate everyone had to snort. Faster kill rate, than theistic religions.  Goose and gander...<br /><br />THAT is why it's so 'natural' to claim evolution true, why young people have trouble believing in God: 'evolution' was drilled into our baby minds over and over -- here, but more so to kids in Russia and China.  Carl Jung quipped, science is the new religion...<br /><br />Thinly veiled, too, for Dawkins labels Chapter Five's first section, 'The Darwinian Imperative'.  Yeah, Imperative.  Not, 'inquiry'.  Fahrenheit 451.  Not, hypothesis (as no evidence supports it). So it must BE imposed, on all us tykes from age 5 onward. Imprimatur.  Catholic.  The Only Answer.  If we take our Darwin Dummy Pills, we'll feel better (page 195). God forbid, another definition of 'evolution' might fit the data better.  Our Ford forbid, that string theory might better VERTICALLY account for the origins and variations in life (sudden OR slow) vs. those pesky horizontally-mutating genes; for stringsmight reveal underlying 'blueprints' in math formulas playing as fractals (sans need to invoke 'God', gaps or no). Oh, but all competition must be ruthlessly extirpated, just as Dawkins did in his Preface; dissenters are faith-heads, packed off to 'Siberia' to be 're-educated' by the smarmy peasants. Dawkins memes should alone rule supreme.<br /><br />Hitler, Stalin and Mao must be smiling down on Dawkins.  Or, grimacing up.<br /><br />CHAPTER SIX, (p.241 'Why Are We Good'), should be titled, 'Watch Me Deflect The Real Issue As I Cant Refute It'.  Here Dawkins again displays total ignorance of Bible.  Its #1 theme is that man is NOT good, so needs a Savior.  Again, the Real God is SUPERnatural, so all of nature's goodness, is not even in the same universe.  So there had to be a God-man, not merely a man, not merely God (man sinned, so in humanity sins must be SUPERnaturally paid).  Obvious, from Genesis 15:6, to Revelation 20.<br /><br />Worse: no amount of knowledge the woman in the Garden could get, would make her as good as God, even BEFORE sin (Genesis 3). For God is SUPERnatural, Unlimited.  So having cut God down to an END process of mindless magical nature, Dawkins must cut God down to 'good'.<br /><br />Which Bible refutes, naturlich. Romans 3:23 in New Testament, Isaiah 64:6 in Old, David's bad yet gets a Greater Son (2 Samuel 7 and Psalm 110:1, God-Man Messiah).  Else none of us could be born the first time.<br /><br />Now, intellectual sleight-of-hand demands substituting relevancy you cannot refute, with irrelevancy you can refute, ergo Chapter Six.  Even so, Christians who can't think properly, have long made this same argument, and response is required. Dawkins did it badly.  Berlinski did it well (pp.34-38 of Devil's Delusion).<br /><br />Yet note how The Real Issue is rather, WHY IS IT IMPORTANT 'to be good'?  Bible tells us we got that idea, from SIN. Adam didn't know what 'good' was. Satan tempted religiously, with a real tree's fruit (=doctrine) named Good-and-Evil (a hendiadys in Hebrew, two sides of a coin). Oh, she'd be AS GOOD as God if she ate it (magic). As a result, the urge to BE GOOD got into our DNA (Romans 5:12), and manifests religiously, starting with the itchy fig-leaves thingy.<br /><br />So we've been anal about being good, ever since. Even, religifying hair gel or 'oh, I'm a vegan'.  Everything is pitched in terms of you're a good person if you buy into it, and a bad person if you don't.<br /><br />So all those evils Bible depicts, the harsh rules under the Law, were to CURB the religifying impulse.  Sodom and Gomorrah was a mass raping, as the Bible story makes clear.  The Canaanites loved to skin people alive, rape, plunder, roast their own children in the arms of Baal/Chemosh/Molech/you-name-it, then have sex while the kids burned alive. So the right question to ask of God, is this:  why did He wait so LONG before wiping these people out?  Do you know, revenge was inculcated even into five year olds?  Many have rebutted Dawkins parroted accusations many times over the centuries.  Dawkins didn't do his homework here, either.<br /><br />Notice Berlinski, never argues in the same way.  He knows many of the arguments were properly rebutted years ago.  He did his homework.<br /><br />So now let's unmask The Real Issue.  The human post-sin mind, unlike animals, creates ABSTRACT 'good', is obsessive about it.  Animals must be TRAINED to have that idea. Many puppy-wetting newspaper sessions transpire, before the puppy knows he must 'hold it' to get Master's approval. That's not a natural value, in the wild.<br /><br />End Chapter Six, it just gets worse. SOS, same old stuff, long since eaten and regurgitated.<br /><br />CHAPTER SEVEN (page 265, 'The 'Good' Book and the Changing Moral Zeitgeist') is worse.  Should be Titled, 'Watch Me Flood You with my Bible ignorance.'  I guess Dawkins doesn't know the Zeitgeist crowd are repeatedly proven fake scholars (they make up 'evidence' ex nihilo like Gail Riplinger does): see labarum312 in Youtube, he's writing a new book on ZG you can buy here in Amazon?<br /><br />We already saw enough of Dawkins' ignorance, in Chapters 1-3, 6, but page 268 is a doozie: Dawkins writes 'God took a dim view of humans'.  So he didn't study the history of that time (2450 BC and up to 120 years prior), blithely ignoring that was one of the most violent times in history.  Per Bible there were only eight HUMANS left.  Everyone else, was a demon hybrid.  Dawkins of course also ignores the portion of the story we can prove, extra-Bible. So he doesn't notice the sexual prohibitions in the Law, were designed to curb a culture worldwide, of violent and rampant 'sex', even long after the Flood.  Oh well.  Maybe someday he'll do some ancient cultural history homework.<br /><br />So how scientific is it, to ignore the history, the cultural context?  Even were we explaining the Epic of Gilgamesh, we'd have to gauge that story in its own terms.<br /><br />So of course Dawkins finds the nuttiest, most apostate Christians' obsessions (i.e., with sex) and ascribes all their foibles, to God.  Dawkins treats these nutters as the True Voice of Christianity, for it suits his agenda. Then picks another nutter, Lot (who Bible uses to PROVE an idiot), as if GOD approved of rape? Thus Dawkins cherry-picks whatever he can spin, to blame it all on God.<br /><br />Yet all the stories of bad behavior in Bible show PEOPLE ARE NO GOOD, hence we need a Savior. Dawkins can't permit that clear meaning. Chapter ends with a kind of defense (page 308ff) re Hitler and Stalin, for only theists can be evil.  Hitler, like Dawkins, was born into a Catholic family. But oh no, Hitler cannot become an atheist invoking German Master Race as 'god'?  MASTER RACE was cornerstone for Nazism, newly re-founded ON Darwin. That doesn't make Darwinism untrue; but its abuse as a religious gambit, is real.<br /><br />And it's Dawkins' gambit, too: CHAPTER EIGHT (p.317, 'What's Wrong withReligion'), should be titled, 'Watch Me keep betraying My Real Goal of Replacing God with Darwin's Faith'. In taqqiyah, you play victim of an enemy you brand guilty of what YOU do. For Dawkins aims to SUBVERT SCIENCE to atheism.  That's why he won't do his Bible homework, and instead picked the wackos of Christianity in Chapter 7.  So here, he picks Prolifers and other nutters, to justify IGNORING Bible which contradicts him and them.<br /><br />As every Jew knows, Bible says fetus is not a legal person, Exodus 21:22 (see my Prolife Blasphemy videos for that and more verses). 'Human' isn't even biological, Genesis 2:7. So Dawkins needs to mask that, by using anti-Bible Prolifers, who like him, also claim 'human' is biological, so shriek 'abortion is murder'.  So Dawkins thinks he smears God and masks Bible's SOUL definition of 'man' (Gen 2:7), all the while reaming out the anti-Bible Prolifers as enemies to 'science'. Cute!  End Chapter Eight, no more value here.<br /><br />CHAPTER NINE (p.349, 'Childhood, Abuse, and the Escape From Religion') should be titled, 'Watch me replace My Brand of Abuse, for other religious kinds'.  No one wanted to escape from any atheist-controlled country like Russia, China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia?  When Dawkins talks of mental abuse (page 354) as criminal -- may we now sue him and his co-Darwinists, for the abuse we've suffered these last 150 years?  For Darwinism is but endless assertion, claiming we cannot SEE the past evidence, as it's too slow. So the difference between a God we can't see but can account for, vs. Dawkins' Flying Speciation Monster we can neither see nor account for.. is what?  Are the priests of Darwin gifted like the fake psychics who claim to 'see the other side'?  WE can't see it.  Glass houses, thrown stones, go both ways.<br /><br />For millions of kids have been INDOCTRINATED with these 'evolution' lies, too. Billions of dollars in wasted time, production costs; meeting hall rentals, endless refutations washrinse repeat. Will Dawkins take responsibility for the fact no Darwinian has ever ONCE produced a shred of hard evidence?  Talk about scam artists;  this is worse than Piltdown Man.  If Dawkins were a woman and a Christian, his name would be Gail Riplinger.  She claimed 'visions' of the Titanic holes, proved the KJV infallible.  Dawkins claims visions too small in the past for us to see as 'holy', too.<br /><br />One last proof Dawkins is dishonest or inept:  page 378, and Chapter 10, re 'gaps'. Dawkins, who did no research into 'the gap theory' re Genesis 1, though there are many scholarly versions over the last 100 years -- Dawkins ignores all that, instead quotes an ignorant Christian saying Earth is 6000 years old. Live Hebrew refutation of that nutty idea is in my Genesis playlist, to prove Bible never says Earth is 6000 years old;  which I learned, forty years prior. So why didn't Dawkins know?<br /><br />So his CHAPTER TEN (p.388, 'A Much Needed Gap') should be titled, 'see My Gap in Scholarship' -- quipping his book fills a gap. Yeah, it does. Until reading it, I didn't fully see how irrational neo-Darwinism was: God is only God if He's not God, but evolved?  Wow. So I didn't know, how seriously in peril, objective science has become.  Now I know. Thank you, Mr. Dawkins.<br /><br />Berlinski already long refuted Dawkins 'evidence' claims, and so too did many others.  Daily.  Darwinists merely chirp 'Evolution is True Because Evolution is True', then 'conclude' their mere claim PROVES evolution true. Yeah, ex cathedra.  They're our new popes, now.  With ugly clay feet.

B00AQN09VQ|3.0|My wife and I only recently started catching re-runs of this gem of a show and I decided that a more expedient way of catching up before the seventh season was starting was to purchase this set, which includes all six seasons on blu-ray.<br /><br />At the time I placed the order I did not realize that this is the UK/Europe region-free version of the show.<br /><br />Each season is arranged on TWO blu-ray discs, which means the shows are compressed quite a bit more than they are on the North American BD releases (where I believe every season is on 3-4 discs).  Also worth noting is that these come with DTS audio, in lieu of HD audio... not that it will make much of a difference for a sitcom.  I don't know how much the compression really matters, they look similar to HD broadcast quality to me, with each episode clocking in around 3GB in size.  It might matter to someone who wants the absolute top quality achievable for the show though so I'm mentioning it.<br /><br />The shows being compressed is not my principal beef with this set.  The packaging for this set is pretty terrible.  Seasons 1-3 and Seasons 4-6 are each contained in a thicker than normal BD case that is really flimsy.  I actually dropped one from about 3 feet onto a tile floor and pretty much destroyed it (part of the spine broke off and it no longer closes).  Even worse, the cardboard that houses these two BD cases is made of really flimsy light weight cardboard, not the thicker \\"collection quality\\" cardboard that I expect with box sets.<br /><br />The show itself of course is great, and if you don't care about the packaging quality, the episodes seem to be the same as their US version counterparts... so this does save you a few bucks versus buying the US versions on sale.  When I checked, Seasons 1-5 were on sale at worst buy for about $20 per season with season 6 being about $30, so by going this route I saved about $45.<br /><br />//update - it has been pointed out to me in comments that all versions (US and otherwise) of this show have DTS audio and have a similar number of episodes per disc... although there might be more special features on US domestic versions.  The packaging for the set is still pretty terrible, so I will stand by the 3-star review.(US and otherwise) of this show have DTS audio and have a similar number of episodes per disc... although there might be more special features on US domestic versions.

B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Our professor of theology shows this film, in its entirety, to her classes on \\"Theology from the Underside\\" about those who preach for the oppressed peoples of the world. One must make a double-take to recognize that the events in the film took place in the middle of the 20th century, and not 200 or more years ago.<br /><br />I'm loathe to say anything about the story in advance, to lessen the impact in any way. There is only one name actor, Kenneth Branagh, in a role where you have to check the credits to verify that it is in fact the famous interpreter of Shakespeare. There is inevitably controversy over the degree to which the villains are painted as too villainous and the heroes are too heroic. But that does not take away from the power of the film, which, in spite of a total absence of flashy CGI and power actors, the story is heart wrenching. One almost wants to believe that things were not as bad as the film makes them out to be, in order to dull the pain. In fact, things may have been worse. While the automobiles signal the '30's, the policies of Australia did not change, eliminating the policies carried out on the screen, until the 1970's. This era created \\"The Stolen Generation\\" which, if you read it from the Australian government at the time, makes perfect sense. Seen from the point of view of the aborigines, it was cruelty of the worst kind.<br /><br />One can be happy that the practices depicted in this film have come to an end. This is the kind of film you may want to insist that your children watch with you (as long as you get them before they are teenagers.)

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'll begin with some reference; I haven't purchased cable tv in over 10 years, so watching Youtube, Netflix, ect are quite normal for me.<br />Allow me to cut right to the chase- it works flawlessly.  This device allows you to broad\\"cast\\" your media to a television.  The easiest way to do this is from your laptop or device using netflix- just click on an icon (square with \\"wifi\\" looking curves in the corner).  It will ask you which device and it will list the name.  Using the Chrome browser, download the extension from the web app store, then click on the icon to broadcast the page.  Set up was a breeze, just follow directions.  I set it up using a Macbook air; I downloaded the chromecast setup .dmg file, opened it, followed the instructions.  Within 30 seconds of opening the program the chromecast was ready.<br />On Apple devices: everything comes up automatically, click on the chromecast icon to broadcast.  This will not tie up the device, you can watch on the tv while doing anything else on your iPhone or iPad.<br />On Android devices: As with Apple devices, everything is automatic, just click the icon.  Today on my old Nexus 7, I broadcasted Youtube videos for my kids while I checked my email.<br />Laptop and desktop computers (Mac, Linux, that other one): Using the Chrome browser, just click the icon to broadcast to the device.  The cool thing is that you can broadcast one tab and leave the others out.  So you can type an email on your laptop while another page/program is being broadcasted.<br />Windows: I don't have any Windows devices or computers, but I read that it is NOT supported on Windows Phones.  I would expect a Windows laptop or desktop to work just fine with this as long as you are using the Chrome browser.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The picture is wonderful- full 1080p.  The sound is crisp and clear.<br />Such an easy device to add to your life if you are accustomed to watching tv online.  Netflix works without any trouble at all.<br />It's small and very portable.<br /><br />Con:<br />The device must be \\"plugged in.\\"  A provided micro USB cable plugs into the rear of the chromecast and must be plugged into a USB port.  The simplest method is to plug it into a USB port on the tv.  It comes with a USB adapter for an outlet and a long USB to micro USB cable.<br />This will not run on networks that have AP/Client isolation.  That means that this won't work in some (more complex) network environments.  A standard network is what this is made for; wifi networks that require a web authentication (i.e. you put your username and password in a browser) will not work.  See the google page on the chromecast for more information.<br />I tried using the Chromecast to broadcast my email page, there was lag while I was typing.  I would type and a second later it would appear on the screen.<br />Also, the device gets warm.<br /><br />Overall: Fantastic device, I think I'll buy at least one more.

B00571F26Y|5.0|A must read if you want to take control of your well being.  Within two weeks of starting a gluten free, low carbohydrate, low sugar diet you will feel less tired and overall feel better.  Try it.  Celiac disease runs in my family, even though I don't have it I have high cholesterol and can't take the medications so I am trying it to see if it makes a difference.<br /><br />It is amazing how without lots of carbohydrates and sugar how much less you actually eat and want to eat.<br /><br />It has been several weeks and I lost 5lbs within the first week.....stayed there for awhile but now I have lost 9lbs.  Looking to lose another 10-15 lbs.  The biggest difference I am noticing is the bloating.
1401938906|5.0|This book knocks it out of the park..blows it out of the water...!!!

What I have to share are<br />my so called thoughts...but are coming from my Heart....!!!

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|In all seriousness though, this book was fantastic. I realize that as a 21 year old, I'm not exactly the demographic they were looking for. Even so, the book made me laugh about the rather uncouth life a very funny lady. I genuinely enjoyed the stories told and found a lot of myself in the in these stories. The way Tina Fey describes both the glamorous and humiliating portions of her life are both quick witted and endearing. Five Stars.

B0009IW98O|5.0|Oh could this man rock!! Worth it for his version of Bo Diddley alone, but not a single sleeper here. IMO, this was Seger's was best period - along with Mongrel and Back in 72, he showed grit and fire and blow-em-away vocals that were never really matched in his more popular era.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I saw this in the theatre. I felt like a Zombie when I walked out of there. This could have been a really good movie, but I kept asking, \\"When will this movie end.\\" I enjoy Sci-Fi, and thrillers, etc. This not so much. If you're a teenaged boy, or younger man, you might enjoy this more. The book was 100x better!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's hard to express how I feel right now. The people felt real and the emotions were too. I knew deep down I needed to read this book and I know there are still many people who need to as well. Life is fragile and short...and this book touches that sensitive subject (death) and makes you think about it. Pain is really truly meant to be felt.
B004SDEP38|4.0|I confess, my son put this on my Kindle. I don't use it very much but when I do I like the app. It works fine.
B00F91G5BS|2.0|Straight from the moment this started, it was action sequence after action sequence taking part in just about every clichéd zombie moment you can think of and more. When they were there, they were great and enjoyable. However, I wish I'd have fallen asleep before the end of the movie as my wife did because the end sucked! To have a film that continued to fill the viewer with action and then to just drop off like it did left me looking for more and very disappointed.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I confess my son put this on my kindle. It works fine Yet I forget to use it sometimes. I like my kindle and most of the apps I have on it. One of my sons put a few of the apps on it.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I read decent reviews on these and the price was right (they had a sale on these and I wanted a set of wireless headphones). After getting them charged they &#34;worked&#34; but I noticed every now and then they would just short out, it would go quiet then I would hear a &#34;beep..beep&#34; then the sound would come back. I thought maybe this was a thing with wireless headphones and it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />On Day 2 the problem became worse, but again, I stuck with it figuring maybe it was working itself out. It still technically worked but the cut out was annoying. This would persist until today... I am now trying to play online with friends and they cut out every 2 minutes or so for sometimes 30 seconds or more. The sound is static sometimes with the volume at any level and I even have them plugged in but have the same problems.<br /><br />In short, I hate these headphones and should have just saved up completely for the Astro A50's. I'd love a refund but I think it's too late for that. I'm stuck with these pieces of crap on my head from now on.

0374203032|4.0|In this book, popular Harvard professor Michael Sandel addresses the question of when it is inappropriate to use market solutions to social problems. Twenty years ago, such a book might have seemed nonsensical, but in recent years, economists promoting markets have gained prominence in many fields -- pay kids to do their homework, pay poor people not to have babies, etc. And in areas far from public policy, explicit markets have thrived -- pay homeless people to wait in line for you, pay kids to gather autographs from baseball players, etc.  Though many economists celebrate such developments as beneficial for all and harmful for none, Sandel is not so sure.<br /><br />Much of the book amounts to catalogs of examples like these. This portion of the book is fun to read, but lacks depth and is never very convincing. \\"Here's an example that surprised me. Here's an amusing quotation from a New York Times article about it. Economists think it's great, but I'm not so sure. Next example!\\" Three chapters deal with particular markets in detail (the market for spots in line, the market for life insurance, and \\"naming rights\\" in stadiums and schools, etc.), and are worthy of comment. The chapter on insurance seemed in many regards naive. Sandel points out that some whose policies were sold dislike it, but unless we take the view that every participant in a transaction should be happy afterwards, I don't see where this is an ethical issue. He then points out that some brokers of the policies misbehaved and broke laws. True, but the same can probably be said for automobile dealers and supermarkets; do we really want to eliminate markets for cars or food? More seriously, Sandel just doesn't seem to understand insurance very well. He nowhere discusses the fact that, absent a secondary market, life insurance carriers routinely return only the cash surrender value of a policy to an insured who needs to get out early. That's the equivalent of your selling a car and getting only the cash back from the glove compartment. Only the secondary market pays the insured for the actuarial value of the policy. Would Sandel argue that it's ethically better to allow life insurance companies to steal from their customers? Probably not, but he manages to devote about 20% of the book to this subject and I don't think he really understands it.<br /><br />The chapter on naming rights is similarly unconvincing. Who cares if sports teams have logos on their jerseys? I appreciate it was different when Sandel was a kid and watched the the Twins play for $2, but much of this chapter comes across as [[ASIN:1586487736 Andy Rooney]]ish-grumbling by an old man. The portion of the chapter about why we shouldn't let companies advertise in schools is better, but also sort of obvious.<br /><br />So why four stars rather than fewer? The book does make an important, convincing argument in chapter 3. In fact, this chapter is good enough that I suggest readers start there, and perhaps skip the rest of the book. In that chapter, Sandel argues that we all benefit from civic virtues, but that civic virtues can be \\"crowded out\\" by market forces and are hard to restore. For example, students who raise money for charity because it's the \\"right thing\\" to do will raise more money than those who are paid a commission, but once you have introduced the idea of a commission, all the students will work less hard at their fundraising, because the social-spiritedness of the enterprise has been tainted. Sandel provides numerous examples, all of them excellent.sh back from the glove compartment. Only the secondary market pays the insured for the actuarial value of the policy.

030746363X|4.0|I have only really read the diet/exercise portion of the book so far...<br />I had very good success with the plain low carb diet several years ago. But it was a painful process for me since I am a chocolate and carb addict. I could survive totally on potatoes/pasta/rice with some ice cream/muffins/brownies for desert! Protein? pfft! So low carb for me is not a lifestyle. I just can't do it.<br /><br />When I read this it was the cheat day that sold me. I was sure that being able to tell myself on a weak day &#34;you can have that (ice cream/brownie/potato) in X number of days&#34; Rather than NEVER being able to have chocolate on a typical low carb diet, that would save me and keep me going.<br /><br />I have been doing it a little over 3 weeks, and I added in light exercise the last week and a half. I have lost 10 pounds so far. I have about 30 more to go to be at the &#34;perfect&#34; BMI for my height.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|When I started this book, I had just finished Gone Girl, which I loved, and was looking for another suspenseful story. I quickly realized this book was not it and could possibly be &#34;chick-lit&#34; of which I am not a fan. While the book was somewhat light and a quick read, I was drawn to the characters and the author's style of writing. She clearly loves her characters and I did too. I found myself thinking of and going back to look for certain observations the author makes about life and relationships. I would recommend this book.

076531178X|5.0|Put simply, I loved Mistborn.<br /><br />The mix of heist elements and almost dystopian fantasy elements were married wonderfully, and gave the story a freshness to someone (at the time) a little burnt out on more straightforward or classic fantasy.<br /><br />Equally impressive was the magic system (where various metals were ingested to lend the user differing attributes) which never functioned as a deus ex machina - a strength to all of Sanderon's stories. While the whole trilogy is great, I feel this the strongest of the three books. It had some fun twists and Vin was a great POV character - her angsty moments were understandable, though I found that Kelsier, her mentor, stole the show.
0385736002|1.0|Was a DNF for me. I don't like that the author, who was not born in America, saw fit to place the story here because he clearly doesn't know the layout of the land. Also, he mixes too many myths incoherently. Was a disapointment.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|I was skeptical at first, but this turned out to be a really good movie. I was kept interested throughout the whole film and it was actually close to being realistic (i.e. General sending Pitt's family off as soon as there was no sign of Brad Pitt). It was really good and balanced with the right amount of gore and a solid storyline.
B005KJJ4F8|3.0|originally posted here: [...]<br /><br />Cinder is based on the fairy tale, Cinderella. But Marissa Meyer added her own personal twist on the original story and changed a lot of it. Cinder is a cyborg and the best mechanic in New Beijing. She has an evil stepmother and stepsister, but she also has a little android friend, Iko. Cinder is abused by her stepmother to do all the work for the family and earn for them. But this is not a typical rags to riches story. There's a plague spreading in the planet and there is an impending intergalactic war, and Cinder has a role to play in it.<br /><br />I am sorry to say that I was underwhelmed by this book, and I'm usually the kind of person who agrees with the majority in liking a book. People have been raving about this and saying so many good things about it, but I did not see or feel whatever they did because this book just didn't sit well with me.<br /><br />I don't understand why they have prejudices against cyborgs. This is supposed to be a time of peace for the whole planet Earth (they have a peace festival every year!), yet they are still oppressing these people. It's not like they had much of a choice. They can't function well if they don't get these robotic parts attached to them. Why do people shun them? This is supposed to be futuristic or something.<br /><br />I know that this is a fairy tale retelling, but the whole story was just way too predictable. I hate that it's so predictable, I would just point out what would happen and I would get impatient for it to actually happen already. I wish I would be wrong and surprised somewhere along the way, but it just didn't happen. It felt draggy.<br /><br />Cinder was an okay female lead, but I don't really have much going on for her. I like her sarcasm because it makes me laugh, but nothing more other than that. I don't really understand Kai very much. I definitely did not fall in love with him. Also, the characters that I really liked only existed in the first parts of the book so that added to my distaste. Although I think the villains were well-made. They are definitely evil.<br /><br />OVERALL, I'm sad to say that I didn't like this book very much. I started feeling iffy about it from the first chapter, but I finished it in just a few hours so I think that merits something. I didn't like the prominent characters, and I hate how predictable the story is. And now, I'm quite afraid to pick up the rest of the books. This did not work for me, but it worked for a lot of people so I guess people should give it a try.the book so that added to my distaste. Although I think the villains were well-made.

031623480X|5.0|I must first admit that I am an advocate for living the Paleo lifestyle, and thus my review may have some bias. However, I offer that this work in many ways offers additional support for that lifestyle, or at least reducing the consumption and thus the impact of grains on our bodies.<br /><br />Admittedly, some of this work does mention allowing the consumption of gluten free grains, which I do as a treat from time to time, even though a very strict/pure Paleo diet does not allow this. However, even with this distinction I offer that this is a good work that should be read by anyone looking to improve their health.

B00AFPVPDG|5.0|I had written and posted a long-winded review of this book, but less is always more. My main points are this. FWIW, I have worked with Josh and vouch strongly for the depth and accuracy of his research. Ignore the negative reviews here unless one says specifically that the reviewer read the book, actually tried the strategies JK promotes and then articulates why they did not work. Notice - none of them do that.<br /><br />If ever there was a writer who was \\"deceptively simple\\" it is Josh. He has a gift for distilling things down to their most essential qualities and for putting them in terms that are practical and easy to execute in real life.<br /><br />The bottom line is the book does exactly what it claims - teaches you skills to get up to speed on things you want to do as quickly as possible and with minimal stress. I read it, am using it, and in my experience it works. But most importantly if learning new skills tends to stress you out then going through each chapter, and seeing how someone with Josh's unique level of intelligent, laid back determination solves problems and acquires skills rapidly, will be helpful. Definitely ignore the reviews that claim the skills Josh learned are not helpful unless you want to learn those specific skills. It's the mindset toward solving different kinds of problems that is key.nsitions and title cards then export the video into a format we can post on our site. #2 says \\"Focus your energy on one skill at a time.\\" Okay, easy enough - import the video up first, etc.  In Chapter Three, \\"Ten Principles of Effective Learning\\" the first principle is \\"Research the Skill and Related Topics.\\" For me this meant re-upping my subscription to Lynda.Com, ($25.00 per month, highly recommended) and reviewing the related training for A.P.E.<br /><br />Are some of these principles obvious? Yes. Does it make things simple? Yes. But busy people with full-time jobs, families to support and long lists of things to learn need simplicity. These are big pluses. I honestly think some of the negative reviewers would have liked this book much better had the author larded it with 100-page chapters filled with charts, graphs, stats, references to Universities, etc. It's as if they would prefer a treasure map to require a DaVinci Code when all it needs is some red dots and a big \\"X.\\"<br /><br />IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS<br />Here's the reality of this book. Josh is a researcher, teacher and writer. He is basically saying to people, \\"Hey, I have developed a systematic approach to learning new things quickly and field tested it, acquiring a passable level of skill in six very different areas. I'm concerned that people have been turned off to learning new skills because they think they have to \\"master\\" everything and don't have the time. If you give me less than $20 (just $7.50 for the paperback), I'll share my ideas with you.\\" That's it. That's the simple human being-to-human being offer being made here.<br /><br />So, for this Josh has been called, a \\"fake\\" a \\"plagiarist\\" and the book derided as \\"superficial\\" a \\"rip-off\\" and \\"poseurism.\\" Some reviewers astonishingly even claim the book doesn't offer a systematic approach. This despite the fact that chapters two and three meticulously spell out the entire system. At the risk of seeming defensive or emotional, I can't let the slander someone I know to be righteous go unchallenged. This simple, he is very well read and does not steal. But here's the bigger point about the absurdity of the negative reviews found here. Not a single one says this, \\"I tried Josh's method and it didn't work\\" or even this, \\"I tried Josh's method and it took me 21 hours.\\"<br /><br />WHY JOSH KAUFMAN IS \\"THE DUDE\\" OF INDEPENDENT LEARNING<br />In Roger Ebert's brilliant review of the classic Coen Brothers film he writes, `The Big Lebowski' is about an attitude, not a story. It's easy to miss that, because the story is so urgently pursued.\\"<br /><br />This is the real genius of this book. Beyond Rapid Skill Acquisition, it's about an attitude. It takes you into the mind of someone who is intelligent, patient and truly loves to learn.<br /><br />So, if you're thinking about buying this book, ignore the negative reviews here. Forget about Tim Ferris, Malcolm Gladwell or whether or not you want to learn the exact same skills Josh did. Forget how this book compares to Josh's classic, The Personal MBA. Just decide if you would like to develop a stress free mindset about learning new skills and a simple, effective methodology backed by high quality research. If you want to learn a new skill and are willing to give it 20 hours of focused energy, you will be amazed by how far you get. That's the simple promise made by this book and it delivers. Now I gotta run. I have an electric guitar to man up to. It's been laughing at me for years and I'm gonna put us both through 20 hours of Hell.
B008ROF114|4.0|Picked this movie out of the blue and absolutely loved it!  John Wayne, Dean Martin and Angie Dickenson at their best!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|For a movie about super heroes, I like the semblance of reality; Bruce Wayne unable to deal with the lose of a loved one and the disintegration of his body from all the abuse. He isn't a super hero, he's a human being with some cool toys and a lot of drive. But, in the end, as we all must face, the body can't take that for long. So I enjoyed the movie for what it was and the many subtle under currents. Plus the ending was definitely cool.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am not a gamer, but this game was so fun.I played the ten levels in two days. In the beginning I thought it was too tough.The instructions could have been clearer.But after I got the gist of it I couldn't  stop.Can't  wait until new levels come out.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A movie everyone should watch.  Brings out values that everyone should strive for and values to teach your children to strive for
B00EDF43MY|5.0|my 4 yr old grand son loves these games and this one he says is the best. three more words?
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Great show - couldn't stop watching. Very engaging. I watched 4 shows back to back. Look forward to watching all the seasons episodes.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Only just discovering this cult-treasure in my early 30's.  The first time I watched it, I hated the kinky weirdness and confusing story line.  But now, I'm officially hooked.  The songs are infectious, Richard O'Brien's score timeless.  I WILL LOVE TIM CURRY FOREVER.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|Well done. Enjoyed the action. Matt Damon is great in this movie.Would highly recommend watching all the Bourne movies.They are interesting.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Loved the three characters.  Great soundtrack.  Very relate-able to my experiences growing up and learning about true friendship.  Great acting.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|For being free it's not too bad. My main complaints are that there are always 4 players and each turn is timed. I also wish there wasn't so much extra stuff - like the rewards and bonus stuff. But since it is free it's good enough...
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I really like this game because it is more difficult to find the hidden objects.I Don't like the fact that each game doesn't let you know exactly what you are expected to do so it takes several tries to accomplish a task. This brings me to the second reason I like this game for being a little differant and that is that your energy fills back up pretty quick!
B0089J270U|5.0|This movie is great! Marilyn Monroe was a good actress in her early years. Very good story line. Would recommend it to anyone.
B008CJ0KBU|4.0|I liked the subject line.  It sort created a thought in your mind that maybe this could be something that could be happening yet not so surprised if it was.  Kept adding different creatures and movements all around you.  I can't wait for the second season
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Loved this movie. It was very touching. It would make a great chick flick movie night even for young girls!
B00BOXZAJ8|3.0|Not too much to say.  the sad part was the was the way the two had to meet, but, his inventive way was unique and impressive.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I bought this movie because my daughter in law said she loved it. Now I love it! My young daughters love it too!
B0090SI4LU|3.0|For a sy fy  I sort of expected a little more.  But, in it's own was it was different.  I did like the fact the people at the end did learn that there is good in each other and can live among themselves in peace.
B00514HDNW|5.0|Like most people, my experience with this story is through the films with Charlton Heston (The Omega Man) and the recent adaptation with Will Smith, I enjoyed the book much more. I have found a copy of the first film with Vincent Price, \\"The Last Man on Earth\\"  and look forward to seeing that one.  I recommend this book to anyone.
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|The title was not was the move was.  But, It was good and did have a wonder to why he stayed on the island so close to his girl.  When the end came around it then made more sense but still a little unsure.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Having received a much more expensive sharpener with a knife set, but apparently not doing it correctly as we could never get the knives sharpened with it, we bought the Smith PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener.  This thing is awesome!  So easy to use.  Works great!  The only thing you need to know is stick to the sharpener near the outside edge unless your knife is absolutely as dull as a butter knife.  just pull it through a few times and your knife will be SHARP!
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  It kept me on my toes and was always wanting to know what was going to happen next
B007EC27QM|5.0|I really like having such a great flexible user-friendly calculator at my disposal. I use this program every time I need a calculator.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|It's a bid odd to be seeing a prequel to have better technology than it's sequel but that's the movies. The characters they have depicting the original cast is dead on. Hope they make a lot of these. It delivers in all catagories
B007GCY8FS|5.0|good plot, lots of action, enjoyable characters and character interactions...  believable bad guy... somehow Lee Child continues to hit the target for me.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|*Edited* Anker customer service reached out to me regarding this issue and offered a full refund without return of the product. That speaks volumes for a company's integrity and efforts to provide quality service. Please note, the mouse is NOT defective in any way, so I have upranked my review to 4 stars. I do \\"like\\" the mouse features and button programming. It simply does not work for my small hands. Hopefully this review will still help others. Thank you Anker for being a top company, would purchase from them again.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I really want to love this mouse, honestly. It got really great reviews and I chose it after comparing gaming mice in similar price range for my budget. In that, the Anker lives up to the stated technical points most gave in that it has very good tracking control, solid buttons and hardware design and easy to use programming for the buttons. The LED light is cool and the little set of weights to vary the heaviness of the base are easy to install. There's no skipping or drift that I noticed in this mouse's abilities. I would say overall it's a very solid device.<br /><br />But now for why I did not rate it higher. It's too big, seriously. Granted, I'm a female, and my hands are not huge, but they aren't tiny mouse paws either. I have long, thin piano player's fingers and I can normally reach a full octave so I should not have any problems holding this mouse. I found the palm of my hand constantly sliding down the back of the mouse and I was always aware of my thumb trying to stay put on the little indentation area below the three buttons there. They made a kind of grippy material there, but it always feels like my thumb is sweaty there, sliding down to the base and it's not sweaty, I'm just having a hard time gripping the mouse comfortably. The left and right click buttons are fine and the scroll wheel is ok, but on the other side, my pinky is also not sure where to be because I'm always trying to readjust my grip.<br /><br />Now granted, I just came from using a R.A.T. -5, a much higher end mouse (that frankly has a very crappy left and right click button that wears out too easily for the high cost (L button broke). I wasn't expecting the Anker to blow me away since I am on a budget right now. But I am disappointed it doesn't fit my hand at all and is making gaming uncomfortable for me.<br /><br />Summary: Great mouse in technical use and precision, but not recommended for those with small hands or a more claw-grip style of holding the mouse..<br /><br />Now granted, I just came from using a R.A.T. -5, a much higher end mouse (that frankly has a very crappy left and right click button that wears out too easily for the high cost (L button broke).

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Great story, and I am enjoying reading the rest of the series! I saw the movie first and knew I had to check out the books.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I love the new crew and I love the new movies. I wish JJ Abrams would have given us a new story. I'm hoping for a new story in the next film. That said, I enjoyed this film immensely. There are always things that fans would like to see differently, but the film was amazingly cast, acted, and filmed. There are few scifi films shot with this level of excellence. Set aside you love of TOS and view this as a re-imagining, you'll be surprised how much you love it!
B0093X805W|5.0|Very well written, easy to love, fun and Dahl is always creative with his words and line of work. Daughter loved it and moving onto Charlie and Great Glass Elevator!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Re-reading the book before catching the second movie.  I an really enjoying the character development as well as the storyline becoming increasingly captivating.  Recommend
B000FBFN1U|2.0|Since beginning this series I have gone from being excited over the material to only hopeful, then I slipped into a vague sense of annoyance, and now I'm simply disenchanted with it. I have issues with the storytelling and also the writing itself at times. I'll try to list the reasons (in no particular order) why I give Martin's work only 2 stars.<br /><br />*** Beware -- minor spoilers ahead ***<br /><br />1) Every chapter from a different POV can be interesting at times, but it gets old, because one's favorite characters are visited sporadically. And by the third book, this method also slows the story to an absolute crawl. At times it even goes backwards!<br /><br />2) Too many characters! I actually had no problem with this until this third installment. But I've finally tired of slogging through details about minor characters, their houses, their sigils, their alignments, their histories. Yes, it gives the world an epic feel, but it's too much.<br /><br />3) Many people like the \\"grey\\" characters of this series (they are not totally good or totally bad). That's fine by me. A good example here is Sandor Clegane, the Hound. He is an intriguing character. But Martin makes him and others like him so darned \\"grey\\" that they go nowhere in the story. They are so stuck in the middle that they really do nothing but create filler.<br /><br />4) Every honorable character in the story (Hi, Ned Stark) are naïve morons, lacking even a smidgeon of foresight. They usually act in illogical and stupid ways, and even when they do show some smarts, they are crushed by their all-knowing adversaries. I am actually afraid to become emotionally invested in a character because I just know that Martin will run them through a medieval gauntlet of horrors, and then kill them off. I realize that characters must die. In war, there is death on both sides. But again, too much here.<br /><br />5) The age of Arya Stark. She is what, ten years old? No ten year old could be capable of doing or enduring what she does. I do like Arya, but her plot (along with all the others) is never ending and I've lost patience with it.<br /><br />6) Sex anyone? How about graphic vulgar sex? Would you like a detailed description of Tyrion's private parts? I didn't want it, but now it's etched in my mind! And another thing is Martin's fondness for nipples. In this story, every man in the world likes to pinch them. What a turn off.<br /><br />7) No plot resolution anywhere. The reader gets no closure, even on subplots. We are all running in place here.<br /><br />8) Dany Targaryen - the woman grown! I am so sick of her telling everyone that she is no child. She is thirteen years old, spends a year as Drogo's play toy, and suddenly she has worldly wisdom and is a woman grown. Please. I wanted to like her, but she is getting as bad as her brother Viserys was, thinking the whole world owes her an army.<br /><br />9) Why doesn't Westeros know about the dragons yet? Is Varys the Spider losing his mojo?<br /><br />10) Martin spends far too much time inside each character's head. He ends up doing a lot of telling versus showing. He uses flashbacks a lot. And far too often, major events happen \\"off screen\\". We read about them after the fact, by a far away character simply being told about the event. Martin managed to vanquish two armies with Melisandra, which I thought was a little lazy.<br /><br />12) Alliteration exists all over the place. Word echoes too. The author is very fond of a few words and phrases, such as Trestle table, Trencher of bread, Soldier pines, manhood,  people doing things \\"not ungently\\" or \\"not indifferently\\", Tyrion's \\"waddling\\", food grease running down chins and beards.<br /><br />Yes, I'm nitpicking. I just wanted to vent everything that irritated me while slogging through Ice and Fire. To close, I just feel that this story started out great, but has steadily gotten bogged down under the weight of too many characters. This series is becoming reminiscent of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" in the way things just stopped happening. I actually finished the last half of Storm of Swords by reading chapter summaries on a wiki site. I'm glad I did, because I was spared the agony of some later events. I don't know if I'll continue the series or not, because it is just so depressing.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Well written, objective recollection of those 2 island battles and what it was like to be on the ground there.  Very thought provoking

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is one of best books I have read all though the kindle format is a bit messed up and strange
B004ZH66XO|2.0|Fun, but I will never get to finish the game due to the fact that our continously crashes at 7-8. Kindasad to spent all that time and never to actually beat the levels.  FIX IT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The app is so fun and I can't get enough of it you are aloud to train pet and go in contest with the
B00BB8T9FC|5.0|Well written.  Kept my interest until the very end.  You think you know what's around the bend then you are surprised as it continues.  Characters well suited for roles and a great job of acting done by all.<br /><br />Sharon

B0042TV4IW|5.0|Very interesting cast of characters worked well together.  Story line kept me attentive until the end.  Looking forward to more.<br /><br />Sharon
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Lovely story that shows that we all are helped by having someone even a cat, to take our mind of ourselves...to have something/ someone to be responsible for...this helps see a bigger picture of life & that motivation for change comes from many places/sources. Great book for anyone including those dealing with any kind of addiction.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It works great with youtube, netflix and basic web browsing, but not Amazon. Nor is it compatible with the Kindle Fire HD.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This is probably the best bingo game you'll ever play.  At first, it's perfect.  You have plenty of credits and the hardest of collection items take a couple weeks.  Your daily credits increase when you complete rooms and every time you level up you get bonus credits.  But as you keep playing, the rooms become more expensive, harder to complete, and that loving relationship becomes love/hate.<br /><br />You will eventually buy credits.  The game is rigged that way.  The daily credits can't be stretched enough to play more than a couple times in later rooms.  After a certain point, the hard to get collection items that can't be purchased show up rarely.  It's such an issue, the chats often revolve around players' frustrations and bitter attempts to secure that last item.  I've spoken with multiple players who haven't seen certain shadows in over a year.  I've been playing one room for about six months and have seen the last item I need once after playing three to four rounds everyday.<br /><br />Should you buy those credits and not receive them, there is no customer service.  I purchased around eighty dollars worth of credits and did not receive them.  There is no phone number, so you have to send an email.  I sent several over two and a half weeks before I went to Amazon's customer service (who by the way was completely fantastic) and was refunded my money.  Thinking it was a fluke, I tried again and again, resulting in the same problem I should have been smart enough to avoid.  In all, I sent about 20 emails from three separate domain email addresses over something like two months, I have never received a reply from the people at BB.  I've scoured spam folders and all, leading me to believe that they could care less about clients as long as they're getting paid.<br /><br />And there's also the issues of disconnection and format.  If you accidently hit bingo, your entire card is lost.  I've been looking at the little fun fact boxes and clicking through when suddenlyup come my bingo cards and I've lost one and wasted credits by hitting bingo by accident before a single number is called.  I've been disconnected six times when a hard to get item is on a card, once right before I hit bingo.  I've been disconnected more times then I can count after completing a game and before collecting rewards, which leaves me less the credits and the rewards.  This is not a kindle issue or a Wifi issue, this is another way BB bilks the soul of me.<br /><br />I'm highly disappointed I've played this game for so long and have wasted so much time, energy, and money on it.  Players beware.
B0017YZIL4|5.0|After all these years, I still go back to listen to the way he puts it all together. Most enjoyable .
1575666286|4.0|I appreciate all of the research and the work that has gone into this book and feel I am benefitting from it.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|IT WORKS GOOD JUST LIKE IT SHOULD. ME LIKEY. YOU SHOULD GET IT. THAT IS ALL. THANK YOU VERY LITTLE.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|Excelent product, nice movie. A masterpiece of animation. Very cheap and its a tow disc edition with a lot of new content
031623480X|5.0|This book is one of those few that can qualify as life changing. Put it alongside [[ASIN:1609611543 Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back to Health]] and the standard American diet is turned upside down. And, that's exactly what this nation needs. As a culture, we're sick and we know it!<br />So often we think of our weight, or our general health and can link it to food but too often have put things like Alzheimer's  in a separate category, genetic, or dementia, inevitable aging. Our culture has been quick to link diet to heart health, but what about our brain? Grain Brain finally brings our brain health to light and empowers us to take control of our mental health. From depression to ADHD to Alzheimer's, there's something we can do!<br />Since eliminating grains (I do still eat quinoa and every once in awhile millet) I have mental clarity like never before. I also have more control over my reactions and emotions. Basically, I'm a better person and I feel it!<br />Dr. Perlmutter aknowledges that life is 'an endless series of choices'. This book will arm you with the knowledge and confidence to take control of your health on a whole new level. He also suggests you aim to stick to a 90/10 rule, following the guidelines 90% of the time. (PHEW! As the suggestion to limit most fruits would be a tricky one for me!;)<br />This book will help you live AND age WELL! Read it, you'll be glad you did!
B000687M48|2.0|Wish I never bought it.  Some of the live stuff  on this CD was too hard to listen to.  Awful.  I will stick to Within-Temptation recordings.
B002ZG97LK|3.0|movie was okay, had scratch on disk, and cover had few scratches and a tear in it,but I guess you get what you pay for! I only paid few bucks so it was okay!
0783225547|4.0|I already had this in old VHS version, but I did enjoy the movie and wanted to have it in my collection.  It was priced right and it came quickly.
B0045HCJSK|4.0|A wonderful addition to my John Wayne collection.  The price was good and it came in swiftly.  I will undoubtedly buy more as time goes on.
B00E00RB5I|5.0|All the classic hooks with all of the best things EWF have going for them. I generally do not<br />pay enough attention to new releases from older bands (dumb). I am happy to have not missed this one.
B000OVLBIU|5.0|I ordered this movie because I love movies with Nicolas Cage.  This movie was better than I expected and I thoroughly enjoyed watching.  It is a must have if you like Nicolas Cage.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|I bought this game just find out you can't buy coins or anything to help you beat levels so I went to Google play and found out there are many features to help you beat levels, you can buy coins and things you need to beat harder levels, so my advice is don't buy thus game from amazon go to Google play store, I am sure glad I never got the kindle fire....with android you have more choices for games and thingsmyou want kindle fire you only have amazon app store as a option...
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Super fun game if you like the village and story type games. Beautiful graphics and good story. Two thumbs up!!!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Could have been much shorter. Not so interested to find the ending to this story. It was too much  involved.
0525478817|5.0|I have not found a book in a good while that I couldn't wait to get back to. Even at work, I would carry this book with me and the moment it was break time, I started reading. This is my first John Green book, and definitely won't be my last.
B005USZML4|5.0|This book was good. You felt like you were right there. He holds you up to the very end. Also<br />Awsome
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I just had to read few comments regarding this streaming box from Google/ Chromecast  and figured until they get the bugs worked out of it I will wait to buy it. If you must have it then for $35.00 OK you could do worse with your money. But I am  happy with my Roku3 and it too has it drawbacks No local channels available, NO NFL Channel bummer :(  if they offered that instead of the NFL mobile app for smart phones that cost $ 5.00 per month to use I say great and if you have more than one HDTV  you will need an another Roku3. And if you are like me in need of new HDTV  I check out some of the used dealers on the various websites like Amazon ect  you will find many of them have streaming services already installed
B008ALAHA4|1.0|Bought the wrong adapter, thought I needed this to make it work; didn't. Not the product's fault. Finding the right connector online can be a challenge.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I found this book from watching the movie trailer and I loved it. The story line was so creative and the writing was magnificent. I really really enjoyed this book I can't wait for more
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This works for me so much better than the strap camera bags. With it on my back does not make my neck tired and achy. I love the Velcro dividers that can be moved around creating different sized spaces for storing the lens.
B001EYU1VO|3.0|It seems that if you want a decent joystick below $100 you are very limited on<br />your options.  This joystick accurate and certainly not sloppy, but you will find<br />that the handle body is rickety and not as solid as I would like.  when you twist<br />the handle for rudder function you can feel the entire body flex.  Also, the base<br />does not lock open so if you move the joystick while on the desk you risk having<br />the base close (the throttle base and right side &#34;wing&#34; collapse).<br /><br />It's a nice stick to take to lan parties due to being able to break it down to a packable<br />two piece stick.  System wise I like the way it works... don't like the build quality however.
B009ZQJVAK|5.0|My wife had secured the book, Kinky Boots, which is nothing like the broadway show or the movie.  As she describe the pornographic nature of the book, I soon realized that there was a disconnect between the book and the broadway show we were going to see.  Located the movie on amazon prime.  Movie allowed us to fully enjoy and understand the broadway show.  If you want to see the broadway show, I strongly recommend renting the moive as it fills in some of the gaps that the play has.  Movie was very enjoyable.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Most amazing superman movie ever!! Although not your classic, it difinetly goes into the character better than the other movies.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The story was very moving, the acting suburb (as expected) and a grand directing debut by one of America's most talented actors Mr. Dustin Hoffman.  I hope it will be only the first film he directs..am looking forward to many more!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Enjoyed it and will recommend to all my friends...every page was very captivating and felt like a thrill ride all the way.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Great set of characters and plots. Hooked on this show, sad to see Ziva leave the series. Hope they get someone half as good.
B001P3SA94|5.0|The roll of each blues singer was well played the music was old school and it is a movie U can have when<br />company come by to enjoy Etta James will always be remenber
B006MPKDD6|4.0|An interesting mystery/detective story with Michael's usual twists and turns. It is a good book to read while on a journey.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As a devoted John Grisham fan I am again impressed with yet another one of his books. They always leave me wanting more.
B003E2UQMS|4.0|This book/novel is very good. Most of wording and sentence is easy to understand even for non-English like me.<br /><br />The story is very attracted and unable to stop reading.  This book give me the meaning of hope, and meaning of improve ourselves. Pat People is a protagonist that like no others, I always wish he has a happy life.<br /><br />The things that I don't like in this book is it spoil other novels too much in a story line.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|My two boys, ages 5 and 2, both enjoyed watching the movie. The characters were charming and the music was catchy.
B00ESY77LO|1.0|I don't know why people like this director. This is absolutely the last movie of his I will see. He is as subtle as a baseball bat to face which is what I want to do to him for ruining the Great Gatsby!
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Really bad with u guys i ordered on 25 days aga and i havent even get my movie and it looks like this guys are not doiing nothing about it
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I constantly looked forward to resuming my reading and enjoyed it greatly. I expected it to be depressing because of the subject matter but it was not at all. As a medical professional who has worked with quadriplegics I found the author to be quite well informed medically. The story rang true and unlike many books had a well thought out ending.
B0000C23DO|5.0|This compilation is wonderful. For any Grateful Dead lover it is a winner. If you need to be &#34;picked up&#34;, this CD will definitely satisfy and you will want to dance.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Wonderful writing.  Those of you who like to follow characters through and miss the magic of the Harry Potter Series this is it!
B005I4JG80|4.0|a lot of what's in this book is, to me, just common sense - and it's so helpful to have it in print! there's so much information on parenting out there that it's nice to be reminded that one can just trust their instincs. the book gets a bit repetitive towards the end - it felt as though the author had a page requirement to hit. other than that, a wonderful quick read.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is a real fun game and I play it all the time<br />their is a lot of iron man suit's and exploding
B00BT70IWS|4.0|This is in some ways is an easy review and a hard facing of facts.  First, I am a huge fan of this uniguely gifted tenor.  He is one of the best before the public at this time of vocal famine.  However, it seems at times he is a great voice in need of guidance and management as to repertoire.  I have to whole hearted agree with Ralph Moore's excellent and detailed review.  Read it!  This voice has naturally darkened and taken on some weight.  This is normal.  The French and German Romantic repertoire would be ideal for it as this time.  Even more Wagner; with possibly TRISTAN and TANNHAUSER.  He might be wise to look at the repertoire of Jon Vickers, Ramon Vinay, Ben Heppner and of course Melchior.  Even SIEGFRIED down the road. Some of his dark color, size of voice, and the passagio are now a shade too big for all of Verdi; especially The Duke, Riccardo, Alfredo and the lyric side of Verdi.  However, having said that, OTELLO, TROVATORE, DON CARLO, I MASNADIERI and even some verismo roles would be ideal. I have heard a MET intermission interview where he stated quite strongly that he would not want to be type cast as only a Wagnerian Tenor.  I agree.  HE HAS SO MUCH MORE TO OFFER!  The orchestra and conducting are routine at best.  I love this voice and some of this recital; but, not all of it was a wise choice at this time for this voice.

0316096199|5.0|I read this book a while back and was moved to tears. Lucky is a painful hard read but important and inspirational.I recently picked up another book from Alice Sebold, Lovely Bones. If I had read it before Lucky I think I would have felt quite different about the book. Both books are very well written and moving. Well done Alice, you are a remarkable woman.
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|It was my husband's turn to pick a movie so we saw this in the theater. Now although comic book movies are not my first choice, I can usually find some redeeming qualty. Not so with The Avengers. I am shocked at the high ratings for this. It was awful from beginning to end. It was nothing but guns and fighting and explosions. There was NO PLOT. There was no character development at all. I never gave a damn about any of the characters. It was like the movie was \\"written\\" by special effects guys.
B00846F1YW|5.0|You don't have to post to anywhere unless you want to. I love playing these games. The levels go on forever. You won't be disappointed get the game.

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I got this game as free app of the day some time ago. It really surprised me because it looks like it has crappy graphics. Instead it turned out to be a fast-paced game so graphics don't matter. You have to get specific combos to move on. Chaining seems to be dependent on luck though. It is a very creative game and I find myself playing it over and getting didn't things first. Starting over doesn't make you feel like you are losing so much. Great game!
B00915G6MG|5.0|As far as I'm concerned NCIS gets better every year, if that's possible. The character development,  the fine acting, the story lines - it can't be beat.

B0081336FO|5.0|I am re-watching all the episodes in this series because I am pining for a Sherlock fix. I can not wait for it to come back and for them to explain the un-explainable (I won't say anything else because of spoilers). Love this show. Absolutely love season two!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player does a fantastic job of streaming video to the TV, I have an older computer which is a little slow but it still streams Netfix and YouTube with no problem. Streaming from Google chrome is a little more difficult but as I said my computer is old and a little slow. I see in the instructions it says the unit may get hot, I don't normally watch more then one program at a time so I haven't experience that problem. If you don't have a USB port on your TV it has to be plugged into an electrical outlet, I keep the unit plugged into the TV but I unplug the unit from the electrical outlet after use.

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I came across this some time ago while searching through upcoming DVD releases online. The title grabbed my attention and I'm a fan of some of the actors so I looked up the trailer for the movie. The trailer was good but didn't tell me much so when I dug a little more I found out what it was about. I had no idea the movie was about a school shooting or that the movie was adapted from a novel. (I love when I see a good movie, or movie trailer in this case, and find out it's based on a book!!) I still haven't had the chance to get my hands on the movie but I remember watching the trailer several times throughout my reading. This is not a happy story. It does not have happy or even likeable characters. But the story is gripping and the relationships inside have made me appreciate things more in my life. The depth of emotion caused me to take my time reading the book. I didn't want to skim or miss anything important. The school shooting itself is more of a backdrop to Eva Khatchadourian's life; because this story isn't about just Kevin and his actions on that fateful Thursday. This is about Eva herself, her relationship with the world before and after Kevin entered it, and her ability to pick up the pieces of her life and get them working again.<br /><br />My only real issue with the book is the author's use of vocabulary words. Bring on cuss words, bring on made-up words, and bring on lame dialogue that makes me roll my eyes any day! But bring on extravagant and excessive language and you'll have to give me a moment to look that up please. I mean thank goodness I was reading the book on my Kindle or I'd have to have a dictionary or thesaurus with me. I literally had to highlight at least one word every other page (if not every page) to see what a particular term meant. Maybe that says poorly about my own use of terminology...I know my vocabulary could be much better. I know I could be more sophisticated, but hot damn some of those words were crazy. Of course context clues can be your best friend while reading but sometimes after I highlighted and looked up a word I literally said \\"Seriously?!? You couldn't have just said *insert something a little less over the top here* But I digress; the vocabulary usage is more a problem for me because I'm not a literary critic and honestly, it was probably above my level in many different aspects.<br /><br />While the characters aren't the people you want to be your friends, neighbors, or even live anywhere near you so you might run into them kind of people I was still completely fascinated by them. Eva and Kevin both are impossible to forget and I have a feeling I'll want to re-visit them many times in the future. I've always wanted to be a mother and I love every minute of it. However, how would my life be if I had a child that seemed to hate me and the world? I don't know... and that scares me. Putting myself in Eva's position is very unsettling and I like that that this story has affected me so. I like books that make me question things, that make me uncomfortable, and can make me cry and cringe. The author has certainly accomplished something with their book if it can affect readers on such an intimate level. I enjoyed Shriver's writing (even with her excessive vocabulary lessons, thank you by the way) and I'm looking forward to more of her work. No matter how difficult this book can be for certain readers I think one is missing out if they pass up on Kevin.<br /><br />**I received an eBook copy of this from my local library**ues can be your best friend while reading but sometimes after I highlighted and looked up a word I literally said \\"Seriously?!?

B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I really enjoy this game until it will freeze up, or it will completely shut you outta the game and you will lose the life you're using. If those problems were fixed I give it a five star.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was hard to read for me as i have recently lost the father of my two sons to cancer.  It really saddened me to read this hopeless perspective on life and terminal illness. This isn't the end... There is more to this life than living and dying! There is HOPE and it is found in Jesus Christ. There is life after death in Heaven for an eternity. Cancer touches us all. Me and my boys know their dad is healed in Heaven and i wish this author and these characters would've known the joy u can have through earthly pain and suffering because u know your eternity will b perfect and without suffering. This is a sad account of how too many people who dont know Christ view life and death.  It is very well written but it saddened me to read this perspective when I know there is so much more to this life! I pray the author finds someone who will share the truth with him so he can write another book with an eternal perspective.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Favorite movie to watch.  Have watched it every day since I bought it.  I Highly recommend this movie for a good laugh.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I just finished book 5 in the Game of Thrones series. I think starting with book 4 and then continuing with book 5, Mr. Martin lost his focus of the big picture and just started writing little scenarios down. There are a lot of branches coming off the main trunk of the plot with nothing bringing them back together. Hopefully he regained his focus for book 6 which is out next year or I may be done with this series. It's a shame because books 1-3 were fantastic. I love the world and the characters he created, but they are not keeping my attention span anymore, nor his it would seem.

B00ECU34ZM|2.0|My family was split regarding this movie.  Some thought the movie was too slow and there were too many questions at the end.  You might have to read the book before seeing the movie.  The other side of family thought that the acting was excellent.  They felt that it was thought provoking and promoted a great deal of discussion.  I recommend that you proceed with an open-mind.

B005D4YOFK|4.0|The first pair I received was awful. Stitching in the ankle strap of the left shoe would rub up against my skin and rub it raw. I couldn't even wear this first pair for a whole day, let alone for hiking.<br /><br />But it was just a defect! I sent them back and the ones I have now are fantastic. The stitching in the ankle straps is not exposed in a way that rubs against my skin. I wear these almost every day and have worn them hiking. They protect my toes and provide good support. However, keep in mind that they do not aerate as much as other sandals would and they also took a surprisingly long time to dry off after getting rained on.

B00AZNEW5G|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0<br /><br />Emboldened by her big Oscar win for 'Hurt Locker', Director Kathryn Bigelow was determined to fry some bigger fish, by taking on the herculean task of chronicling the 10 year manhunt for America's most wanted man: Osama bin Laden. Initially, Bigelow partnered with screenwriter Mark Boal, to write about the failed attempt to catch Bin Laden at Tora Bora. Everything changed when bin Laden was caught and disposed of, so Boal scrapped the Tora Bora script and hashed out a new one rather quickly, featuring the now famous mission that resulted in bin Laden's demise.<br /><br />Bigelow's strategy was to create a composite character based on the exploits of numerous CIA agents who were involved in tracking down and eventually uncovering bin Laden's infamous lair. She ended up creating 'Maya' (Jessica Chastain), after hearing about one particular female CIA agent involved in bin Laden's capture. As Rex Reed correctly notes in 'The Observer,' there was no evidence that the hunt for bin Laden was the exclusive province of one woman. In Reed's opinion, Bigelow's desire to create a \\"Wonder Woman\\" character backfires, as it ends up that \\"Ms. Chastain's stoic, textbook approach to the role does nothing to illuminate or enlighten.\\"<br /><br />The bigger problem with 'Zero Dark Thirty' that it's inherently undramatic. Maya is never pitted against a concrete antagonist, who she must butt heads with. In its place are a coterie of both individual terrorists who we get to know for only a short time (Ammar Al-Baluchi, who's water boarded due to his 9/11 connections, or faceless terrorists, such as the ones who attempt to assassinate Maya, when she attempts to drive out of the US Embassy in Pakistan). Bigelow ends up connecting her fictional Maya through sleight of hand: suddenly she just happens to be eating dinner at the Islamabaad Hotel, when it's blown up in 2008 or her good CIA friend Jessica, is killed in the 2009 Camp Chapman attack. It's all good journalism, but Maya's individual drama, feels forced. When Maya does butt heads, it's merely with one of her CIA bosses, who's slow to act on her intelligence, due to orders from above (the new Obama administration certainly is proceeding too slowly for the veteran analyst's tastes).<br /><br />After a series of drawn out CIA torture scenes, as well as the aforementioned historical scenes straight from the CNN breaking news play book, Bigelow's and Boal's journalistic 'research', pays some dividends when we're made privy to the way in which the CIA (Maya) tracks down bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed, who eventually leads them to bin Laden himself. Perhaps the most interesting scene in the film, is the way in which Ahmed is tracked down while driving his SUV (he's located through his cell phone signals).<br /><br />While I would argue Bigelow is way overrated in the script department, she does know how to use a camera. The final scene, where the crack team of Navy Seals invades bin Laden's compound, and finishes him off, is expertly choreographed and actually somewhat nail biting (even though everyone knows the outcome).<br /><br />Still, I'll argue Ms. Bigelow is a vastly overrated director, another Hollywood 'flavor of the month' (usually 'flavors of the month', can last a good number of years, before they lose their taste). It's understandable, given the fact that there have been few female directors singled out as significant by the Hollywood powers that be, that suddenly Bigelow finds herself in the spotlight. In Zero Dark Thirty, Bigelow and Boal mistakenly assumed that by merely clipping a few newspaper articles and conducting a few interviews with people connected to the CIA and then inserting a composite character into the action, that's enough to create a compelling story. Their 'mistake' still paid dividends: the overwhelming body of critics as well as a liberal general public, overjoyed by the liberal Obama administration 'win', rubber stamped an ordinary film, as a masterpiece!ma administration 'win', rubber stamped an ordinary film, as a masterpiece!
0316044695|5.0|An epic adventure of the hardship, sacrifice and determination of the nation's elite warrior.  I have read the book more than once and marvel at the heroism of our troops.  This should be required reading for all history students in America.
B00BGI086Q|1.0|Since I do not like to watch TV, commercials and having to wait week, to week to follow the story.  I buy the DVD's.  I just finished watching, The Walking Dead (Excellent!), Point of Interest (Excellent), Spartacus (OK). DaVinci's Demons (OK). I tried Arrow.  I read the reviews listed in Amazon and I took the chance.  What a mistake!!!  The characters, are narcissistic, shallow, superficial.  The scripts are cliched, predictable.  I would imagine since this show aired on CW, that this series is geared for kids.  Stay away from it
B000001IPL|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums ever! Definetely one of my favorite. Anyway I purchased it as a gift and I was a little nervous about ordering it but when it arrived it was sealed in great condition. I had lost my origional so was happy to have this baby arrive in the mail. A few weeks later I saw the Offspring in Longbeach, CA and that was amazing as well.
B0076D21O2|5.0|This was an interesting story of political intrigue and scandal.  It was very interesting and made you re-evaluate how people use to live
B008602KQI|4.0|Not the best book to film adaptation, but definitely not bad. The acting is fantastic, but the story is less than adequate. If you read the books first, you probably won't like it as much. But bear in mind that the books couldn't have been made into a PG-13 movie.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  Fun.  Cute monkeys. I have played this game more than any other games I have.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you are new to the Laws of Attraction, then this is the perfect start! Simply do the exercises, believe they will work and be in amazement.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|I've read all his books now. They are so beautifully written and provide such an insight into Afghanistan life and people.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|I know... Gazillions of people LUV this movie, so this review is to warn off anyone who:<br /><br />* Expects any sort of story and/or plot<br />* Doesn't think sitting through almost 2.5 hours of explosions is especially cool or entertaining<br />* Expects a movie that's comparable to the \\"Batman\\" trilogy.  Don't even imagine...<br /><br />But if gobs of heavy-duty special effects are good enough for you, then The Avengers will make your day.  I will say that the weird dragon-like giant creature that floats through NYC wreaking havoc was sort of memorable.
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|Awesome songwriting and vocal talent.  Seems to have been produced with a low budget.Would like for there to be live drums.
B009K0OPQQ|3.0|I've been an ardent fan of the show from the beginning, of the extraordinary cast in particular (they get 5 Stars!)- in seasons one and two I waited each week with baited breath for the next episode. But even though I want to see what happens next, and I'm watching season three, some things have troubled me about the show from the start. I've thought about it quite a bit, and though I'm not sure how well I can express it, I'll try. [NOTE: There's an update at the end of my review.]<br /><br />I read recently that the director Sidney Lumet said \\"In a well-written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well-written melodrama come out of the story.\\" Though I'm still puzzling over what this means, exactly, by that definition I'd say Once Upon a Time is a melodrama, in that it is plot-driven, rather than character-driven. I think in the best works, in any genre, a great story zigzags back and forth between drama and melodrama, i.e., between plot and character development, each seamlessly informing and enriching the other. ONCE is woefully inadequate in the character development department. The characters are one-dimensional. These fantastic actors (and we fans) deserve so much more.<br /><br />Before you say \\"They're fairy tale characters, for goodness sake, what do you expect?\\" I expect good drama- character development to rival, complement mythic themes. In thinking about the show, it finally dawned on me that the character neglect reminds me of the cognitive deficits in certain syndromes. In autism, for example, especially Asperger's Syndrome, one thing that characterizes many patients is a preoccupation with the trees to the exclusion of the forest. Such patients focus for hours on separate parts, on the mechanics of things. An analogy might be someone intent on cataloging the stars in the sky, one after another, but being unable to appreciate the majesty of the cosmos, feel a sense of awe and wonder when appraising the night sky in its entirety.<br /><br />Similarly, in Oliver Sacks's wonderful book THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HAT, he describes the behavior and bizarre \\"reality\\" of patients who've suffered right-hemisphere brain damage. What remains is the left hemisphere, and the way it processes info is by parts and feature analysis. Lacking the right brain, which puts everything together, sees relations, wholes, and attaches feelings and significance to perceptions and events, the left brain focuses on sequential details, linear analysis, which results in a very odd and unsatisfying experience for those affected, sadly. Indeed, patients with Asperger's and RH damage tend to have great difficulties with personal relationships, their perceptual blinders rendering them unable to apprehend other people in all their complexity. People who love them often find interactions extremely frustrating.<br /><br />ONCE reminds me of that brand of reality, a focus on the machinations of the plot, with scant appreciation of the depth, profundity and emotional complexity of human beings, both individually and in concert with each other. The characters' major function is to drive the plot forward, it's the plot itself that take precedence, like a big math problem (albeit at times an intriguing one).<br /><br />The antithesis of this, for me, might be the pithy, splendid TV Series THE CROW, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN or the movie FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY. They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.<br /><br />And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist- I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem). Seriously, if I didn't know better I'd swear the show was written by a bunch of 14 year-old boys with high-level Asperger's Syndrome (some Asperger's folks have high IQs, see the world in simplistic, black and white terms, but construct super-elaborate scenarios around simplified themes from which they're loathe to deviate).<br /><br />[Update: I stand corrected- as others kindly pointed out, they've corrected that situation and have hired female writers, I'm happy to learn.] Fairy tales have traditionally been the province of girls, much more so than boys. Granted, most fairy tales were recorded &/or collected by men, but I've always pictured them being offered as gifts, infused with hopes and dreams, by mothers down through the ages, told as bedtime stories, a feminine oral tradition fueling their children's- especially their daughters'- imaginations. I DO applaud the writers for depicting strong, heroic women, kudos for that. All I know is that what l most love about fairy tales...isn't here, it's missing.<br /><br />Were I the head writer on the show, I'd ensure that the writers focus less on the dizzying intricacies and pyrotechnics of the plot (could it BE more pointlessly complicated??), and slow down a bit, putting flesh on characters' bones and exploring relationships between them. Can you do that without sacrificing clever plot twists, and while still showing what's happening with multiple characters? Sure, ST. ELSEWHERE, for example, did it spectacularly well (the best TV show ever, I think)- and the hit show BORGEN too, from Denmark. And actually, come to think of it, another offering starring Ginnifer Goodwin, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, also succeeded in that respect (at least I think so, not everyone liked it as much as I). In a review of it it was noted that even a brief scene in which Bradley Cooper declined Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette bespoke volumes about the characters (while also advancing the plot), no wasted moments. Anyway, the marvelous actors on ONCE deserve such character development and subtlety, that's what I'm waiting for, yearning for, anyway...<br /><br />Then again, when I'm feeling a little less magnanimous, I wonder if maybe the writers and producers don't know EXACTLY what they're doing. Now and then there's this nagging feeling that somehow I'm being made a fool of, that maybe someone's having a good laugh at my expense. Why would ANYONE stick around, year after year, given so few crumbs, on a mere promise of something that never seems to materialize? Where's the payoff for my attentiveness, my loyalty? Perhaps some suit said: \\"Mix up the metaphors! Throw in everything but the kitchen sink, THAT'LL keep 'em guessing. Hell, we can even call it a new GENRE!\\" Or: \\"Just toss around a few buzzwords, you know, true love, true hearts, true WHATEVER...human imagination being what it is, they'll supply their OWN profundity. HEY! How about SAVIOR- it's LOADED with associations, throw THAT in!\\" Could there be a standing bet as to how long the show can be drawn out, how much profit can be amassed, how much convoluted but simplistic DRIVEL can be heaped on hapless fans before they begin to get wise? You know the old saying, you can fool some of the people...

Granted, most fairy tales were recorded &/or collected by men, but I've always pictured them being offered as gifts, infused with hopes and dreams, by mothers down through the ages, told as bedtime stories, a feminine oral tradition fueling their children's- especially their daughters'- imaginations. I DO applaud the writers for depicting strong, heroic women, kudos for that. All I know is that what l most love about fairy tales...isn't here, it's missing.<br /><br />Were I the head writer on the show, I'd ensure that the writers focus less on the dizzying intricacies and pyrotechnics of the plot (could it BE more pointlessly complicated??), and slow down a bit, putting flesh on characters' bones and exploring relationships between them. Can you do that without sacrificing clever plot twists, and while still showing what's happening with multiple characters? Sure, ST. ELSEWHERE, for example, did it spectacularly well (the best TV show ever, I think)- and the hit show BORGEN too, from Denmark. And actually, come to think of it, another offering starring Ginnifer Goodwin, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, also succeeded in that respect (at least I think so, not everyone liked it as much as I). In a review of it it was noted that even a brief scene in which Bradley Cooper declined Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette bespoke volumes about the characters (while also advancing the plot), no wasted moments. Anyway, the marvelous actors on ONCE deserve such character development and subtlety, that's what I'm waiting for, yearning for, anyway...<br /><br />Then again, when I'm feeling a little less magnanimous, I wonder if maybe the writers and producers don't know EXACTLY what they're doing. Now and then there's this nagging feeling that somehow I'm being made a fool of, that maybe someone's having a good laugh at my expense. Why would ANYONE stick around, year after year, given so few crumbs, on a mere promise of something that never seems to materialize? Where's the payoff for my attentiveness, my loyalty? Perhaps some suit said: \\"Mix up the metaphors! Throw in everything but the kitchen sink, THAT'LL keep 'em guessing. Hell, we can even call it a new GENRE!\\" Or: \\"Just toss around a few buzzwords, you know, true love, true hearts, true WHATEVER...human imagination being what it is, they'll supply their OWN profundity. HEY! How about SAVIOR- it's LOADED with associations, throw THAT in!\\" Could there be a standing bet as to how long the show can be drawn out, how much profit can be amassed, how much convoluted but simplistic DRIVEL can be heaped on hapless fans before they begin to get wise? You know the old saying, you can fool some of the people... I haven't given up on ONCE yet, but I'm getting awfully close.<br /><br />UPDATE: The show continued in much the same vein, until Episode 4, Quite a Common Fairy- smashing, brilliant, exactly the kind of stories, with the interpersonal punch, I've longed for.

B00AEFYS8G|1.0|It starts out with a stranger rolling into town with 3 men waiting to kill him.  NOBODY in this story knows who this guy is including the gang that killed him.  Does that make sense to you?  That's pretty much the way the whole movie is to me.  A bunch of people talking to each other, fighting each other, then allying with each other, then fighting each other again. In this movie was some story about a railroader trying to gain control of a piece of land. I also found the harmonica music very annoying.  Now, it may not help matters that I was doing other things while watching this movie, but still, I found the storyline very unorganized and confusing.<br /><br />Very long and drawn out.

B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a seriously delightful comedy! It's for sheer entertainment. Louis is a little over the top, but by Season 2 he is a little more reasonable. I love the synergy between Harvey and Mike. Donna is high on my list of favorite characters. Jessica is a class act.<br /><br />The romantic scenes are not so graphic they are unpleasant, but they are there. Language is kept pretty tame, too.<br /><br />To tell the truth, this is about a world unknown to me:  riches and serious competition, so maybe that's why I enjoy watching it so much.
B00E8B1358|3.0|Mindless violence and things being blown up.  Okay entertainment if there's nothing else to choose from...which I would find hard to believe.
B005LJETYI|5.0|Great work of science fiction.  Very entertaining and different.  A lot of short stories are based on standard plot lines for the genre they represent but I have never heard a tale such as this one.  My only criticism would be the back story on who sent the mimics. Good book overall and I highly recommend it.

B000GTCZWQ|4.0|Whale rider is a heart-wrenching story of a girl, Pai, who believes that she was born to be the next leader of her tribe.  The story takes place in eastern New Zealand among the Whangara people.  They believe that their ancestor, Paikea, rode to shore on the back of a whale when he encountered trouble at sea.  This is a patriarchal tribe that believes the first-born son is a direct descendant of Paikea and that they are destined to be the chiefs of the tribe.  When Pai was born there was a twin brother who died along with her mother.  Her brother was destined to be the next chief.  Pai lives with her grandmother and grandfather, Koro.  They have a special bond and love each other dearly.  Koro is very traditional and will not allow Pai to learn the ways of a Whangara chief.  Instead he gathers all of the first-born males to teach them and then test them to see who will be the next chief.  When he finds out that Pai has also learned all the boys are learning he gets very angry and will not speak to her or rise from his bed.  One night whales start beaching on the sand in their village.  The villagers try to make the whales comfortable and to coax them back into the sea.  There is one whale apart from the others, the biggest whale.  The villagers believe that this is Paikea's whale and they know that if he goes back into the water the other whales will follow.  The villagers cannot get the whale to go back into the water.  After the start leaving the beach to rest, Pai goes over to the whale and the whale goes back into the water with Pai on his back. Pai rides the whale into the sea and is found and rescued a day or so later.  All of the other whales follow.  Koro realizes that Pai is gone and at that moment accepts that she should be the new leader of the tribe.<br /><br /> This movie is very reflective of the indigenous tribes we have studied in our World Religions class.  The tribe has the story of how they came to be through the story of their ancestor Paikea.  They are very strict in their traditions as to the roles of men and women and they have rituals and chants for different ceremonies or occasions.  The indigenous religions we have studied in our class also have their different creation stories and their rites of passage for certain stages of life.  They have songs or chants for all reasons, be it death, birth or a coming of age.  The movie Whale Rider gives the viewer a feeling of how these tribes continue to keep their traditions even in a more modern age.<br /><br />Barnett, John (Producer), & Caro, Niki (Writer/Director).

0553386794|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Game of Thrones TV series, so I decided to check out the book version,too.  I liked it a lot.  The book and the series seem to follow fairly closely, but the book definitely goes into a few things in a little more depth than the show does.  Relationships between characters in the past, especially, are covered better in the book.  I enjoyed it well enough to read further volumes in the book series as the television series gets far enough ahead of them so that I don't run any risk of spoiling the show for myself.

Faves are Thrashers Abbatoir, The Granulating Dark Satanic Mills (with a powerhouse of a chorus), Grade 1 Surgical Steel (which echoes No Love Lost lyric wise) and the epic closer Mount Of Execution!

140006922X|5.0|After stating that the evidence for and against a historical Jesus are of about equal weight the author then presents plausible and scholarly historical speculation about Jesus of Nazareth and it is well worth reading for the historical background upon which his life was played out. The author presents the analogy of having bought a forgery (the myth) and found the original (the history) underneath. If your view of the story is one in which myth and history are seamlessly intertwined illustrating the evolution of one theology into another then you may have some restoration to do on your own.<br /><br />I think the material is well organized and masterful in presentation. It is rare, I think, to find an author with whom you agree completely. If you think that the Gospel of Mark combines the elements of Jewish myth and the Homeric Epics then you may be a bit resistant to drawing a conclusion from the \\"fact\\" that the author of this gospel shows no particular literary talent.<br /><br />All in all I cannot bring myself to subtract a star.
0307352153|4.0|Without question, the United States chugs along on the Extrovert Ideal: gregarious, alpha, and comfortable in the spotlight. Ms. Cain's book is not an attempt to sully extroverts, but to show that introverts bring other valuable characteristics to the table that extroverts lack and should heed. She analyzes our shift from a Culture of Character (Introvert) to a Culture of Personality (Extrovert) which began with the success and influence of Dale Carnegie. Then the self-described-introvert author journeys to other notable domains to better understand the extrovert mindset. These areas include attending a Tony Robbins's retreat, the Harvard Business School, and evangelical minister Rick Warren's campus.<br /><br />On the flip side, Ms. Cain also visits Cupertino, California which is home to an inordinate amount of academically-minded, introverted Asian-Americans; interviews an introvert professor whose lectures and classes are widely popular on campus; and attends a workshop for introverts to overcome their fear of public speaking or, heck, actually adding their two cents to any group discussion. The author makes many cogent points about how the 2008 financial meltdown could possibly have been avoided if the gung-ho extroverts running the show had listened to the introvert's opinions which are personified in Warren Buffett. She also points out that the school environment of group participation as well as brainstorming business meetings do not work well for our ilk. Even our conflicts with countries such as China can be partly attributed to the extrovert/introvert dynamic. I don't know if the author was aware, but many of the introvert characteristics she covers are also attributable to high-functioning autists.<br /><br />The book is an easy, enjoyable, informative work. The next-to-last chapter \\"On Cobblers and Generals,\\" however, I found annoying because it gives recommendations which felt very much like one of those gooey self-help books that women love to eat up like they're hot fudge sundaes. In addition to recently reading the excellent 'The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion' by Jonathan Haidt, 'Quiet' gave me a better perspective of the human condition and how conflicts arise. The book hopefully will help me become a better husband, parent and citizen. If you are like me, an introvert, the author's work will be a great comfort. For extroverts, it likely will be an eyeopener.ike they're hot fudge sundaes.

B0070Y46UY|1.0|This book was extremely hard to read. Not only because of its style of writing, but because it just didn't make any sense! I mean, seriously? This book is about as spiritually deep as a kiddie pool. Yan Martel just doesn't realize what the word &#34;spiritual&#34; means. It means devotion and faith to something, not just saying and doing the stuff your supposed to do to be &#34;considered&#34; part of that religion; or to be able to  say &#34;I have faith in...&#34;<br />It makes me so irritated and upset to see that this &#34;spirituality&#34; is where our society is going. Though I do think that a couple of things of what Yan Martel said about some stuff like the thing on fear was pretty good, I do not recommend this book to ANYONE who is just starting in ANY kind of faith (esp. Christianity). Trust me, it will confuse you terribly.

B001BR5NN0|3.0|Although John Hughes' classic teenage film lacks an exciting plot, its exceptional character development and its timeless message make it a worthwhile watch. The film focuses on five high school students, each from a different social group, stuck in an eight hour Saturday detention. There's Bender, the criminal, Claire, the princess, Andy, the jock, Brian, the brain, and Allison, the basket case. They are stuck in a library with only each other for company, so gradually, even though there is initial resistance, they all begin to talk.<br /> The film's best quality isn't that it has an original, exciting plot, because it doesn't. With one setting, a high school, there is a lack of interesting scenery, and the premise of a film based on high school students was popular during the eighties and became overdone. However, the witty and thought-provoking banter between the characters and the development of each one helps to make up for the uninteresting plot. Each character tells their story, offering tidbits about their family and personal lives and they slowly start to develop into much more than the stereotypical nicknames they're given. At the beginning of the film, as soon as Principal Vernon leaves the room after addressing the students, Bender (Judd Nelson), in true troublemaker fashion, begins trying to get a rise out of Andy (Emilio Estevez) and Claire (Molly Ringwald), and succeeds. Claire points this out to Andy, telling him, \\"Just ignore him.\\" Bender replies with, \\"Sweets? You couldn't ignore me if you tried\\", to which she has no response. Following, there is a moment of intense eye contact between Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson. This scene sets the stage for the continuous sexual tension between Claire and Bender throughout the film. Bender has some of the most memorable lines of the film and delivers them well, dripping with sarcasm. Estevez does an excellent job of playing the tough jock, but occasionally throws in a sensitive moment. He doesn't hesitate tothreaten Bender after he insults the girls, but when everyone else is shunning Allison (Ally Sheedy), he stops and listens to her. Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) is the typical brain, throwing irrelevant academic information into the conversation and quickly shutting his trap if he is challenged. However, Hughes reveals another side to Brian when they all open up to each other, a side most viewers wouldn't expect. Sheedy does an excellent job of playing the school basket case. Her delivery of biting dialogue and her accurate portrayal of quirky, strange habits are enough to make the viewer believe she is a little bit crazy.<br />At some point or another throughout the day, they all open up and reveal very personal secrets about their lives. It's no surprise to the viewer that each of them isn't exactly as they seem on the outside, and they don't all completely fit their character molds. Andy points this out to all of them saying, \\"We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all.\\" Some of their secrets are predictable, yes, but the problems these kids face are realistic and relatable to current teens, even over twenty years after the film was made.<br />The Breakfast Club may lack originality and a sense of excitement, but there's no doubt the film has a timeless message. Everyone has their problems, even those that seem most put together. Hughes is able to keep the audience appeased while delivering this message, and the film has enough interesting moments to keep the audience entertained. Each viewer will have his or her own opinion on the story, but there is no doubt that The Breakfast Club has become an American classic.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I have lost many documents over the past month from my kindle fire HD.  When you try to open a document it tells you there is a backup avail or some other.  It is never the last version of the document created and it overwrites your most recent version of the file.  I have overcome this problem with word docs by backing up to the cloud. This is not an option for the .xlsx files.<br /><br />Expect your work to be lost and never create any important docs with this software.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game but get slowed down some by needing items to continue playing that they want you to buy.  Still can play for free but it's delayed going.  In all pretty fun game.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have a Samsung Smart TV and the Google Chromecast is interesting but does not work well with my TV, the resolution is very poor. There really is not much more I can do the Chromacast that I could not already do. So I gave it three stars for affordability, It's an interesting start but has a long way to go.  Apple TV is much much better in my opinion.

B0074D3CAQ|5.0|If you love British lit-- if you love British countryside-- and if you love wonderful and moving literature you cannot do much better than this. Again I find myself surprised that there are readers who just don't \\"get\\" this book. It's a tender story of a man setting off on a VERY unlikely pilgrimage to visit an old, sick friend. As he travels, things change, memory unravels, secrets are revealed, and hearts turn toward each other. Too many beautiful passages to name. Best book I've read in years. Just go read it! A thousand times more truly British than Downton Abbey.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|like the fact you never have to wind it but it does tend to pick up a couple minutes over a couple days.  As far as reading the dial, well, if you're anywhere near needing glasses you'll need them to see the day/date...

044024630X|2.0|***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />The good news: Okay plot, some back-story on the protagonist, and the best use of a midnight train since the Pips. Deus ex diesel engine. I found myself sympathizing with some poor conductor, unseen and unnamed, who by the end of the book must be suffering from a really bad case of post traumatic stress disorder. (Read it, you'll understand.) Despite problems of style and substance, the book at least kept me reading.<br /><br />The bad news:<br /><br />1. Reacher is a murderer. During the course of the book he executes three people. (Actually, he kills a fourth, too, but we'll give him self defense on that one.) Reacher is supposed to be a cop, but he conducts himself like a psychopath. I've known a lot of cops who daily dedicate heart and soul to bringing wrongdoers to justice. Summary execution isn't justice. Any cop who decides to simply murder bad people is a monster. Should we admire the economy of Reacher's \\"justice\\"? He's admirable only if you're the sort of fan who admires Walter White in \\"Breaking Bad\\"--as a ruthlessly efficient bad*** narcissistic destroyer who has no compunction about killing. Count me out--I know a villain when I see one.<br /><br />2. For a protagonist who thinks himself a man of few words, Reacher's narration suffers from logorrhea. Leading up to action, he'll endlessly describe the setting when a few apt words would suffice. This man of action can't get to it without blather. In the tradition of writers of tough-guy fiction, the author wants to employ short sentences (sometimes), but his sentences have a bad habit of piling up like the cars of a derailed train. He'll describe something and then add another very short sentence that restates exactly what the preceding sentence said. It's almost as if he's decided the first sentence is too long, so, as a man of brevity, he adds a shorter sentence to summarize. (It's hard, I suppose, to correct a writer this commercially successful, but a good editor with abig box of red pencils could improve the Reacher books. Not gonna happen.)<br /><br />3. Lee Child is a Brit attempting a classic American literary archetype, and in some ways he gets it right: The loner, a man of action but not words, complete in himself and not tied down by social conventions. Child, however, pushes the archetype further than it will go: Carrying only a toothbrush, a little money, and the clothes on his back, Reacher wanders about the country homeless, randomly stumbling into slam-bang adventure. (For a man who walks everywhere and likes to get romantic with beautiful women, wouldn't it be good to carry a stick of Mitchum Power Gel, too?) Reacher evokes characters like John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee (sadly under-appreciated by modern readers), Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer (ditto), Richard Kimble from \\"The Fugitive\\" TV series, and numerous hard-boiled detectives from earlier decades. But the loner archetype only works if he has an ethical code. The hero can't be just a killing machine, and if he does kill, it must be only out of necessity. Such a character should never appoint himself righteous assassin, otherwise he becomes ethically indistinguishable from John Wilkes Booth.<br /><br />4. I'd hoped that this story would tell us why Reacher adopted his peculiar walkabout lifestyle--was it some traumatic event that delivered a staggering blow to his psyche? Unfortunately, the slight explanation offered up comes across as lame and unsatisfactory. Same for the limp resolution of Reacher's association with the military and relationship with the sexually impeccable Sheriff Elizabeth Deveraux. (As the Pips would say, Woo-Woo, Woo-Woo! Trying to not spoil too much.)<br /><br />This was my third Jack Reacher. I'll probably try another after awhile. If the protagonist continues to be wantonly murderous, the present book will be my penultimate.<br /><br />ON FURTHER REVIEW:<br /><br />After I posted this article I gave it some more thought. (I concede thismay be more thought than the book deserves.)<br /><br />I pointed out that Reacher has two troublesome characteristics: He's an extreme unsocialized loner and a near-psychopathic angel-of-revenge. I also said that the ending of the book didn't satisfactorily explain his decision to go straightaway from his rigid and disciplined military career to a life as a drifter. I'd thought  the book would reveal some horribly traumatic event leading to Reacher's walkabout, but no.<br /><br />I've come up with a new theory: Jack Reacher is profoundly mentally ill, a dangerously insane voices-hearing anti-social drifter who keeps on the move to stay one step ahead of the butterfly net and straitjacket. If so, that makes him a completely unreliable narrator, and his descriptions of his very unlikely lifestyle, superior combat skills, and against-the-grain heroism are in fact only delusions of grandeur. Mental illness might also account for a somewhat obsessive and disorganized prose style. It would explain the real reason the Army cut Reacher loose and why he can't hold onto a relationship.<br /><br />Previously I'd thought of Mr. Child as a British admirer of America and its streak of rugged individualism embodied by the tough-guy loner archetype. But is that the case? Or is Jack Reacher a sly satire on something Mr. Child sees as pathological in the American character, the brutal sociopath representing America going it alone, dangerously cut off from the civilizing forces of the rest of the world?<br /><br />Just a somewhat subversive theory. If it's true, the book is both more thought-provoking and less agreeable.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really like how the book was written in letter form.it gave a while different feeling than just a story. There were twists and surprises that kept you interested and made you want to keep reading. I haven't seen the movie so I don't know how that compares, but I really enjoyed this book. It is great for anyone who knows what it's like to be an outcast in high school, or anyone who likes stories about teenagers.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|After reading about 14 or 15 books written by Jeffrey Archer, I must say that the stories get a bit predictable.  However, I must like his writing because I read so many of his books.  They are typically easy reads and the reader sort of get sucks in by rooting for the hero or heroine and want to find out what happens to his or her life.  Let's face it; his stories are one hell of lot better than the &#34;drama&#34; & &#34;suspense&#34; that the TV Networks are trying to sell as entertainment.

B00A2H9OZS|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo85JSTSQ2LDSD]]My video review of Riddick from my videoblog, Pulpcrazy.com. If you liked either of the Riddick live action movies this is right up your alley. It's done more in the style of Pitch Black, but it doesn't forget about Chronicles of Riddick either. This is also a throwback to the classic Rated R movies of yesteryear, think Alien and Predator. It also owes some to Jeremiah Johnson and Rambo: First Blood. Not to mention its pulp roots.

B00D5LC4GY|4.0|I love this game.  It has easy, medium and hard puzzles. My granddaughter was able to figure out the easy puzzles and I love the medium and the hard ones. The only thing I don't like is when you move a piece to the place you want to fit it in, the piece will jump back out and you may have to put it back more than once to get it to stay and this uses up the seconds that it takes you to finish the puzzle.  That is why I'm giving it four stars.  However, I would still recommend it.

B003F1WM2K|4.0|It is a story of two artists and lovers that evolve artisticly and sexually in most ways. I find the author honest and candid about her struggle to move on and never moralizing or make herself a victim of sircumstandings as most feminist writers would have. I loved to observe the artisic scenery of early seventies and late sixties as it resonates with my own experience although I'm ten yrs younger and living at that time in a remote town in Iceland. My lack of understanding the finer threads of her text is because my english is not authentic and many names and places in NY are not so intricate but what I could relate to was surprisingly much. I would compare this to Dylans Chronicles.

B0053KWDES|4.0|Purchased to boost volume and clarity of phone calls paired with iPhone 4S.  While the sound quality is better and will help clarity, would have liked to see more of a volume impact. Now understand volume increase will require a more powerful amp--which may be my next purchase.
B000OCY7JE|4.0|The quality of the acting was near perfect in all the major roles.  The directing must have been fantastic to bring out such quality performances.  The plot starts out interestingly, but becomes a little too predictable once the main secret is revealed.  The problem is the story itself and its heavy-handed message.  Nevertheless I was hooked by the cinematography and the characters, and would definitely recommend; bring Kleenex.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked the pace of the book and the very extraordinary plot lines. The characters seemed so unaware and predictable until they were faced with very unusual circumstances. Kept asking myself what would I have done.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|[[ASIN:B009XIXVU6 And the Mountains Echoed: A Novel]]<br /><br />Having read Khaled Hosseini's previous two novels: The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, which I found real page turners and very dramatic, I decided to read his latest novel. This novel was very different in style but also illustrated Hosseini's remarkable talent for writing interesting novels.<br /><br />This novel was slower moving with myriads of characters interconnecting with each other. They were either relatives, friends or neighbors spreading over two generations or even three in some cases. The novel begins with a folk tale about a div, a giant in Afghan folklore, who steals the youngest son of an impoverished family in a poverty stricken village. When the father sets out to find his son, the div shows him that the child is living happily in a palace, playing with other children. The father then has to decide whether to turn back and leave his son where he is or take him back to a difficult life in the village.<br /><br />This story is told to Abdullah and Pari, a day before they take a long and difficult journey from their village to Kabul, where the father leaves Pari, the sister of Abdullah, with a rich childless couple as it was difficult for the father to support both children. Abdullah was devastated by this for a long time as he and his sister were very close. The separation of the two siblings forms the basis of this incredible novel which at times seems rather long-winded as it is composed of a number of short stories, told from a number of different angles by the various characters in the book.<br /><br />The actual story begins in 1952 and meanders along with the various players relating their own experiences and their connections with the various characters in the book.<br /><br />Hosseini's medical knowledge in describing the illnesses and handicaps of some of the characters makes the novel even more realistic. The writer is a qualified physician and this blends very well in adding a lot of realism to the novel itself. The characters actually flip out of the pages making the reader empathize with their misfortunes, desires and the brilliance of this writer's portrayal of them makes the book really hard to lay aside.<br /><br />I would recommend that the reader not put the book aside but read it from beginning to end in as short a time as possible. If this is not possible the reader can lose the thread as there are so many characters involved who have much to say from their perspective that one can get confused.<br /><br />This is the reason why I feel that this novel is short of a 5-star rating. Despite this all the loose ends seem to tie up towards the end as the families had spread out over a number of countries. I found the book very readable even though I would have preferred less characters and more emphasis on the main players that make up the story.in adding a lot of realism to the novel itself.

140006922X|5.0|Lots of Christians in the US are not going to like this book because of the conclusions the author reaches.  They are happy with their lifetime of hearing the party line from various Christian churches.  This is about the original person, Jesus of Nazareth versus the complicated person of The Christ that was written about in the New Testament, which was written many years after his death. I am personally interested in learning and this book has provided me with lots of new information, and also helped me to clarify my own feelings about spirituality.  Don't approach this with immediate hostility, and you might learn something.

B00CLT31D6|5.0|Hello everyone,<br /><br />I would just to comment on the book \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" by Drs T.Stanley and W.Danko. I've read some of your reviews and have found them all very interesting.<br />I was recommended to read this book by an American man back in 1996. I remember paying about $10 for it. I had never been an avid reader, so when I was encouraged to read a book just like that, I thought, well I'll read it but it will probably be just another read...<br /><br />Today, last year, and the year before that,I can safely say that \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" has influenced my life for ever. And I thank the Lord it has for the better and not the worse. I'll explain..<br /><br />Like other people who have written a review on the book, I can tell you that I used to spend what I didn't have! I never had any money in the bank, and although I had a few jobs here and there, I was lucky to have a few savings in the bank- if any at all! But the truth is that whenever I needed money for my rent, food, transport etc I simply had to touch my hard fought savings. I felt at a dead end for years.<br /><br />I found that when I first began to read about the study made of the lifestyles of the US millionaires, I learnt many things! Not just about the information on the wealthy etc,, but about words like frugal and affluent which were not in my daily vocabulary. (By the way, I'm a teacher of languages, English especially!). Anyway, the book is a must for anyone who wants to learn to \\"hang on to his or her money\\"; for anyone who is tired of getting into debts; for anyone who wants to accumulate thousands of dollars by living well below his or her means; also for people who want to learn to invest in order to accumulate wealth. Remember the lines.. \\"Wealth is not what you spend, wealth is what you accumulate...\\"  Remember also the letters PAW - and become one!: a prodigious accumulator of wealth. It will pay off in the end.<br /><br />Since reading this book, I am extremely frugal, And why not? Why spend $200 on a SEIKO watch (or any other make for that matter) when you can get a TIMEX for $55.00 which I guarantee can last you 10 years! A watch is a watch. Huyndai is a good car. Why take out a loan for a Mercedes when you cannot afford it?? A car is a car. Why American Express Gold etc credit cards when a VISA does the same job and gives you free miles? Chapter 2, no matter what they say.. FRUGAL  FRUGAL  FRUGAL.<br />Today, like some reviewers, I have thousands of US dollars in the bank, I owe only a small apartment and soon I will have paid it off. Other than that...ZERO DEBTS!<br />I enjoy my life most days, I've travelled half the world (the other half is coming). And I don't have to wear a hat to impress anybody like Mr Texas with his \\"Big Hat No Cattle\\". Live well below your means, be frugal, accumulate and invest. And you'll see the results before you know it, I assure you.<br /><br />God bless you all and thanks for reading my comments.

145162607X|4.0|My full review can be found on my blog: [...]<br /><br />Anne Neville and Richard III have always interested me. Well, Richard more so than Anne, but still. In my mind, Richard was this evil, intimidating, old man who tormented England and killed his nephews. I never opted to research or read more into it. I just accepted it. I'm not saying what Philippa Gregory wrote is what happened, but it is interesting to read an account of what MIGHT have happened.

1451626096|5.0|This review can also be found on my blog at: armywife2310.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/the-white-princess-by-philippa-gregory/<br /><br />Rating:  5 stars<br />Pub date:  23 July 2013<br />Publisher: Touchstone<br />Genre: Adult Fiction, Historical Fiction<br />Format: hardback, obtained from the Public Library<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />The White Princess opens as the news of the battle of Bosworth is brought to Princess Elizabeth of York, who will learn not only which rival royal house has triumphed, Tudor or York, but also which suitor she must marry: Richard III her lover, or Henry Tudor her enemy.<br /><br />A princess from birth, Elizabeth fell in love with Richard III, though her mother made an arranged betrothal for her with the pretender to the throne: Henry Tudor. When Henry defeats Richard against all odds, Elizabeth has to marry the man who murdered her lover in battle, and create a new royal family with him and his ambitious mother: Margaret Beaufort, The Red Queen. But, while the new monarchy can win, it cannot, it seems, hold power in an England which remembers the House of York with love.<br /><br />The new king's greatest fear is that somewhere, outside England, a prince from the House of York is waiting to invade and re-claim the throne for the house of York. Fearing that none of his new allies can be trusted, Henry turns to his wife to advise him, all the time knowing that her loyalties must be divided. When the young man who would be king finally leads his army and invades England, it is for Elizabeth to decide whether she recognizes him as her brother and a claimant to the throne, or denies him in favor of the husband she is coming to love...<br /><br />As much of a Tudor lover as I am, I must admit that I didn't really know all that much about Henry VII. I knew that his marriage to Elizabeth of York basically ended the Cousins' War (War of the Roses) by merging the two houses (York and Lancaster), but that was about it other than he was the father of Henry VIII.<br /><br />We start just after the battle of Bosworth where Henry Tudor wins over Richard III. Richard III is killed, the crown is stripped from his corpse, and his body is left in shame to be buried in an unknown location. (If you didn't know, he body was recently found and identified within the past year. Cool stuff!) Elizabeth knew either outcome of the battle she would be the next Queen of England. She was Richard III's lover and his wife, Anne Neville, had recently died. She was betrothed to Henry Tudor to secure his supporters in trying to rescue her brothers in the Tower, but when that failed, the betrothal remained anyway and shifted part of the York support to him against Richard.<br /><br />In his way of revenge for her making him look like a fool while she was Richard's mistress, he forces himself on her over and over until she conceives. Only then does he consent to marry her. It is announced that the baby is a \\"honeymoon baby\\" conceived in love and bliss of the beginning of their marriage. She is safely delivered of a son, named Arthur, who is to become Prince of Wales.<br /><br />The royal family is plagued by \\"pretenders\\" to the throne. Boys claiming to be the Princes in the Tower. The first pretender comes to nothing and is taken into the royal service and slowly rises from kitchen boy to falconer. The Dowager Queen Elizabeth, helped support the uprising and is eventually banished into retirement at Bermondsey Abbey. Henry believes that this will be the end of her meddling. He still stays extremely distrustful of his wife, Elizabeth, always saying she still supports her York relatives.<br /><br />Another rebellion rises surrounding her cousin, Edward, Earl of Warwick, who is the son of George, Duke of Clarence, and his wife Isabel Neville. The young earl is then imprisoned in the Tower and never again gains his freedom. He is portrayed as a simple boy who does not fully understand the trouble of being related to the fallen royal family of York. His sister Maggie is a constant companion to Elizabeth.<br /><br />Through the struggle and haunting of \\"the boy,\\" Elizabeth and Henry fall in love for a while. They get over that they were forced into a loveless marriage to secure alliances. The love is fleeting as the threat of the pretender grows and grows over the years. Henry is nearly driven mad with the chase of this boy who claims to be Richard, Duke of York, the younger brother. Elizabeth never admits that she and her mother slipped Richard out of sanctuary and sent a pauper in his place to the Tower.<br /><br />While dealing with the threat of the pretender, Henry struggles to gain the love of the people of England. He taxes them to the brink and is hot and cold in his clemency. The lords and commoners hate him which drive them to support in secret and in the open, the boy called Richard. Elizabeth finds herself caught in the middle. She doesn't know if she should stand by her husband or turn to the boy who claims he is her brother. She ultimately decides to stand by her husband and her children.<br /><br />After the threat of uprisings in England seem to die down and chasing the pretender all over Europe, Richard lands in England. He is taken prisoner at Exeter and Henry decides to be lenient and keep him as a prisoner. He also falls in love with Richard's wife, Katherine, who is cousin to the Scottish king. He promises her that as long as the pretender does as his parole commands, he will not be harmed.<br /><br />Henry hopes that in showing the pretender to the people and having created a history for him, the people of England will turn against him and finally support Henry. This plan backfires. \\"The boy\\" has all of the charm of the York family and draws more supporters. Henry then keeps him close at court. At the Palace of Sheen, there is a fire in the wardrobe, where \\"the boy\\" is staying. Henry thinks there is no way he could have survived and is delighted in the beginning until he realises he was duped and he had been in his wife's rooms that night and was safe. Elizabeth fears that Henry set the blaze himself in order to be free of the pretender.<br /><br />After a progress, the royal family returns to the Tower. In the middle of the night, \\"the boy\\" flees from his guard. It is believed he drugged the guards to escape. He is quickly found and placed as a prisoner in the rooms that the Princes in the Tower were originally placed in. He is on the floor above his \\"cousin\\" Edward of Warwick. Henry then tries to entrap them in plots. He finally confesses this to Elizabeth as he realises that his plan is backfiring against him and more people than those he ordered to entrap the boys are involved. Finally, he has no choice but to pursue execution.<br /><br />Henry tires of waiting for the court to draw up a jury and has the verdict called out against \\"the boy\\" before he even faces a trial. He is executed by hanging, Henry deciding to be lenient and not have him drawn and quartered as well as hanged. The day he is hanged, Elizabeth hears the singing of Melusina, the founder of her house, which is a signal that one of her household died. Elizabeth is further convinced that besides looking like her brother, Richard, that he was in deed her brother.<br /><br />Days after\\"the boy\\" was executed, Edward of Warwick was found guilty of treason and executed. Elizabeth's half-brother, Thomas Grey, believed that he didn't fully understand what was happening. He was a simply boy and had spent over half of his life in captivity in the Tower.<br /><br />After the executions, Henry withdraws from court claiming sickness. Rumours start swirling around court and Elizabeth goes to confront him. His mother explains that he deeply cared for \\"the boy,\\" because he was the only one who could understand Henry. Not fully understanding, she confronts Henry telling him he must return to his court. He then explains that he is riddled with guilt over executing two innocent boys. Hesays that only \\"the boy\\" understood what Henry had gone through as a child in exile. Growing up being told he was born for greatness and to wait until the time was right to come forward.<br /><br />Elizabeth admits to Henry, after she had admitted to her confessor, that she and her mother had placed a curse on the murderer of the boys. The curse was that whoever harmed the princes would lose their own son and a grandson in childhood and that their line would end with a daughter. Both the confessor and Henry scoff that there is no such thing as curses. Henry goes further to say that he never harmed her brothers and that they are safe in their succession with three boys. Elizabeth points out that her mother also had three sons and died with no heirs but girls. Henry says that he had to kill the boys otherwise they never would've been safe on their throne. He pleads for forgiveness and reluctantly Elizabeth grants it, realising there is much she has to forgive.<br /><br />Though this is where the book ends, this is not the end of the story of Elizabeth of York. If you know Tudor history, you could say that by the wording of the curse, either Henry or his mother had Edward killed in the Tower as well as the pauper (if a swap occurred), then if \\"the boy\\" known as Perkin Warbeck truly was Richard of York, the curse played out against them. Arthur Prince of Wales dies in adolescence. His younger brother, Henry, eventually succeeds to the throne, and leaves as his heir, a sickly boy in Edward VI. Edward also dies in adolescence, leaving as his heirs, his older sisters, Mary and Elizabeth. Both die childless, thus ending the male Tudor line.<br /><br />We don't know what really happened with the Princes in the Tower, but to me, this account seems likely. Otherwise, why would Henry VII have spent so much time to create a back story for the boy who was executed with no name, but was also called Perkin Warbeck? Also, if the boy wasn't a true claimant to the throne, why would somany courts of Europe and so many English nobles have supported him? Who knows? It's a great mystery!<br /><br />I can't wait to see how the last book plays into the series and how it ties in with the Tudors series Gregory has also written. I would definitely recommend this book and series! It's been so full of feels! I also enjoyed learning more about the beginnings of a family I've loved studying for years. Seriously, you should see my nonfiction shelf. It is FULL of Elizabeth I books. I've written more reports on her than I care to admit haha.<br /><br />Recommended for: History lovers, those interested in the first Tudor king, Elizabeth of York, and the mystery surrounding the Princes in the Tower<br />Not recommended for: History haters, those who have no interest in English history - especially Tudor history or the Princes in the Tower
B007MB5OCE|4.0|The book is very entertaining and hard to put down.  It is a little like the movie Forest Gump, so if you liked that movie you will enjoy this book.
0143124544|3.0|If I hadn't really enjoyed the author's other books I would have given up on this one. I really had no desire to read about how sad Louisa's family was, how poor and slightly dysfunctional. I hated her sister, I hated her boyfriend, I didn't really care too much for her. Then we meet Will, and he pretty much sucked, too. He, of course, had a better reason for being a jerk, but still.....I was depressed the entire time I read the book.<br /><br />Things only got interesting after Louisa found out about Will's grand plan, and especially when she started planning their adventures. It did make me think about the subject matter, and I still don't know where I fall. I certainly can't fault Will for his feelings, and I hope I never have to experience that pain and make that decision.<br /><br />The Last Letter From Your Lover and The Girl You Left Behind were excellent. They both started out very, very slow, but I ended up loving them. This book is monumentally different from those, so don't go in expecting that same premise. I did end up enjoying that last third of this book, but it's not something I will ever read again or recommend to friends.<br /><br />Hopefully her next book will follow the same formula as her other two. This just depressed the hell out of me!

B00AEBB86A|5.0|It came on time, new, and at a great price. Winning combination. I got tired of  getting it mixed up with the western by the same name.
B00EV4EUT8|4.0|First things first: although \\"The Butler\\" aka \\"Lee Daniels' The Butler\\" (the longer name forced on the film by a Warner Brothers' copyright threat over their own nearly 100-year-old film \\"The Butler\\") is based to some extent on the true story of Eugene Allen, who did in fact serve under seven presidents and lived to see Barack Obama become the first African-American President, a great many of the details in the film are fictionalized for dramatic effect.  If this is a major issue for you (it is for many folks), be forewarned then; a significant example occurs early on, as our title character (named Cecil Gaines in the film) leaves the plantation he's working on in the south largely because of an incident of violence that did not in fact happen to the real Eugene Allen.  There are other important details in the film that are fictionalized or altered; this one is worth mentioning because it makes for a greater contrast between the life he left and the life he gained than there actually was.  Given the harsh realities of black life before, during, and even after the Civil Rights era, I'm not sure it was necessary to begin the film with such violence.<br /><br />But this is not, for me, a huge problem, and I think the film's general thrust - that a black man's service to the men who occupied the highest office in the land did not exempt him from indignities small and large, and that there was still blatant racism even in the White House, even years after MLK, Malcolm X, and the Civil Rights Act - rings true and is generally well and potently told.  Forest Whitaker, one of the finest American actors of his generation in this reviewer's opinion, gives a typically excellent and well-rounded performance, playing a character who is essentially passive for much of the film but managing to give him plenty of pathos, dignity, and occasional moments of emotional power.  I don't think it's anything close to Whitaker's best performance - that would be his monumental portrayal of Charlie Parker in [[ASIN:B000053V7P Bird]] - but the difficulties in playing a static character who must hide his emotions over much of his life shouldn't be underestimated.  David Oyelowo as Gaines' eldest son Louis - Freedom Rider, close associate of Dr. King, Black Panther, and ultimately Congressman - is just as impressive, and the rocky relationship between the father who is willing (generally) to wait for black lives to get better, and the angry son who will do anything to help create equality NOW, is at the heart of the story.<br /><br />Louis, though, does cast a light on one of the problems with the film - the need to hit every historical event possible, to put the Gaines family in the center of as much of black experience as can possibly be shown from the 60s through the present.  Louis' achievements aren't impossible and are mirrored in some real-life people, but added to all of the close associations that his father seems to have with every President - being alone with Jackie as she weeps over JFK, hearing Reagan defend his South Africa policies but then later listening to him wonder aloud if he was right, handing LBJ his toilet paper, etc - does make it all seem a little \\"Forrest Gump\\" at times.  And the famous names who play the Presidents, including Robin Williams as Ike, John Cusack as Nixon, and Alan Rickman as Reagan, distract as much as they add any dramatic urgency to the story. I'm also not entirely sure that Daniels and his screenwriter Danny Strong needed to soft-pedal the actions and attitudes of the Presidents themselves; the film leaves you with the feeling that the men who served in the office were all (eventually) pretty decent-minded when it came to their attitudes about race (though admitting that LBJ, Nixon and Reagan had quite imperfect records) and one feels that the blame is placed almost entirely on southern racists.  It feels a little gutless at times, in refusing to really take these men or their administrations to task.  As the film draws to an end, it all adds up to a frankly predictable, play-your-heartstrings finale that honestly didn't need to be pitched at the emotional heights that it hit. The real story - or something closer to it - would have felt a bit more satisfying to me.  But if you're a big fan of the traditional Hollywood ending, you may not mind; and I will say that there was a tear or two on my face, despite the \\"oh, of course this is the way he'll end it\\" feeling.<br /><br />And a big part of that lump-in-the-throat effect, I'm pleased to say, was due to Oprah Winfrey's outstanding portrayal of Gloria, Cecil's brash, sexually charged, hard-drinking, but world-weary and always caring wife Gloria.  I'll say right off that I've never been a huge fan of Oprah's TV show, or her public persona.  Maybe it's because she often seems to be putting on an act even when I'm fairly sure she's not; and I think that's because she really is a born performer.  I HAVE been a big fan of her as an actress, and her Gloria is almost as memorable as her Sethe in Jonathan Demme's criminally underrated [[ASIN:B00C4Q0238 Beloved]].  There's a wonderful toughness and brittleness and intelligence in Gloria, but also a crazy side, and one of the major achievements of \\"The Butler\\" is as a convincing portrait of a tumultuous marriage in which each partner really does seem to realistically complement the other.<br /><br />So to sum up, this certainly isn't a film that feels real as history - a little too much is stuffed in - and it's a little too Hollywood and sentimental at the end for my tastes.  But it does feel emotionally true to the periods, and it is well worth seeing for the excellent performances, especially that of Oprah Winfrey.  I don't think the great film about the American Civil Rights era has been made yet, but \\"The Butler\\" does get more right than it gets wrong, and it's eminently watchable.ilm draws to an end, it all adds up to a frankly predictable, play-your-heartstrings finale that honestly didn't need to be pitched at the emotional heights that it hit.

B00DC7N9NS|4.0|james franco slips up a few times in very subtle ways, so not much affect over all. the witch is totally not believable or scary (unless maybe one of her fireballs was streaking towards you for real) but over all it is a good movie and fun to watch
1401234542|5.0|I'm not big into graphic novels or Green Lantern really, but I bought some Green Lantern comics cause I've always kind of liked his powers and his character. I loosely know some of the story so I had to go back and look stuff up because I guess these pick up where the series is at currently, but overall These new 52 storylines are fanfreakingtastic. I read it cover to cover in one sitting. The artwork is phenomenal and the story just left me wanting more.

B00D3NSDVO|4.0|While this is a mighty tome, the way Terry Hayes moved the narrative between characters kept me engaged throughout the 700 odd pages. At times it was a bit gruesome but the detail was in keeping with the genre and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I found this film adaptation of Jane Eyre very frustrating and lacking.  I am not a stickler for a movie to adhere closely to the book, however, this one changed so many details that it was just frustrating. (Sorry, I can't think of another word.)  I'm so glad I did not spend a lot of money getting this. I ordered it in the four movie set offered here on AMAZON. Very disapointing.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I found this to be a fascinating mix of stories. One story discusses the misguided shift in modern running style, driven by over-engineered shoes that essentially increase injury and rob of us our evolutionary drive to run. The other two stories cover the modern evolution of ultra-running and some of the characters in the field juxtaposed to the ancient running styles and culture of the Tarahumara people of Mexico. Interwoven through it all is the author's personal journey from broken down runner to burgeoning ultramarathoner. I found it completely inspiring. I'm not a serious runner, but I have started moving to minimalist shoes to allow my feet to do their job instead of relying on marshmallow padding.

1400097029|2.0|This reminds me of another book by Banville - The Eclipse - as it is about an elderly man fleeing his previous life after the death of his wife and starting a new one in a quiet spot by the sea where he has spent his childhood.<br /><br />Once the author has taken this idea - which is hardly original - he has to come up with either a good plot or good characters or he will be forced to write much ado about nothing.<br /><br />He interlinks the present day with episodes from the character's childhood 50 years earlier.<br /><br />We have memories of his own parents, a well-off family who used to spend the summer and with whom he became involved.<br /><br />It's easy going stuff but cries out for some action. I abandoned it as I did The Eclipse as I felt it verged on self-indulgence.

031623480X|4.0|This is an excellent book, written by a neurologist who is also a nutritionist.  The material is accessible enough for the layperson, yet also gets quite technical at times, which should satisfy those readers looking for in-depth information.  It seems clear to me from reading this book that gluten in general and all grains in particular are a problem for many people. Dr. Perlmutter explains why in detail, giving ample explanation of what inflammation does to the body and the brain.  He also talks quite a bit about sugar, which is another big piece of the puzzle in brain health.  I was already following a mostly Paleo eating plan; I am now motivated to eliminate all grains, starchy vegetables and all sugar from my diet.  I will report back in a month to let you know how it's going.  My motivation for eating this way has to do with low mood and low energy level. I gave the book four stars rather than five because I think the author might have somewhere included the role of bio-identical hormones in improving one's brain function.  I am a 52 year-old woman and have seen marked improvement in my symptoms after starting bio-identical hormones.  I did some research and discovered that more than 1 in 5 women between the ages of 40 and 59 are taking an anti-depressant, the highest rate for any group. I'm hoping the addition of bio-identical hormones and the elimination of grains and sugar will put me on a path to better health, along with close monitoring of the adrenals and thyroid. All of these things are related.  That being said, Dr. Perlmutter certainly does a superb job of elucidating the grain-sugar-brain piece of the holistic health puzzle.

Moreover his guitar solos are no match for Nat's beautiful piano styling. Nat was truly one of Jazz' Piano Greats and George can play great Jazz guitar when he wants to, but unfortunately he did not choose to or wasn't allowed to do it on this over produced/ over arranged recording. Too much effort and money went into \\"updating\\" the material for today's younger audiences, as if they were not capable to understand the beauty of the original.<br />Please, do yourself a favor - save your money and get the real thing! There are many wonderful recordings of Nat Cole singing and especially don't miss his wonderful piano playing - if you are not a fan already you will be one for sure!<br /><br />In a words of a great detective Monk : \\" You'll thank me later!\\"
B00F2362IE|1.0|First time I ever actually spent money on an app and the thing barely works. Most of the time it never loads or takes minutes to load. It worked the first day fine, but now it's horrible and I have a crushed 3 year old. I have uninstalled, restarted, reinstalled several times. I have hundred of FREE apps that never crash or lock and here is a 3.99 app that won't work. Very disappointed!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|I was going to rate this lower, but then I asked myself, \\"Self,\\" this is a movie about comic book heroes. And for what it is, it's darn good.<br /><br />However, I think the hype that surrounded this one made me go into it expecting more.<br /><br />If you are like me and haven't seen this, put the hype aside, focus on what makes comic book hero movies good, action, larger-than-life characters, special effects, and get ready for some good old-fashioned CGI dust-ups.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B00EE3FTNM|2.0|Starts off interesting but now... I don't care any more. When I found out that none of the actors knew \\"who did it\\" then I can understand why it seems all over the place with no real commitment from any of them (actors or seemingly writers). Its blah, blah. blah lets see where this goes. It suffers from... a lot of nothing... meaningless dialogue and events...  I think it sounded good on paper but the lack of involvement is boring and the script, actors and production leave me flat! AND I'm sad about it because I thought it sounded promising!
B007HU7NBK|5.0|Loved this book! Brought back so many memories. If you were a duran duran fan this is a must read
B00BAXTYF8|3.0|I like this film a lot; I really wanted to love it.  I've said a million times and I'll say it again; Star Trek works best on TV.  The best Star Trek stories - the ones that deal with social and moral issues - have been TV episodes.  The films obviously have to do a bigger job of selling to millions of people who may or may not be diehard Trekkies.  Billed as \\"A Generation's Final Journey\\" (obviously the final film for the cast of The Next Generation, Star Trek: Nemesis tried hard to be that.  In some ways it succeeded, it others it failed.<br /><br />Where \\"Nemesis\\" whole-heartedly succeeds is the farewell of Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner) and the introduction of the beloved android's dysfunctional prototype \\"brother,\\" B4.  As with the character of android Lore, Data's more sophisticated sibling from TNG, Brent Spiner plays the new character with perfection.  The film's other big success is the relationship between Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his foil, Reman-raised human Shinzon, who becomes Praetor of the Romulan empire after a successful Reman coup.  Patrick Stewart and Tom Hardy play those scenes brilliantly, a tribute to both actors.  Captain Picard comes face to face with what his life could have been like under different circumstances, and the conclusion of that storyline is a heroic and tragic sacrifice, the most \\"human\\" sacrifice of all.  Finally, the relationship between Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes)and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) comes full circle.  The film includes the wedding of Riker and Troi, which includes the return of characters Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) and Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), but takes a dark turn during the film's overall mission that includes telepathic rape.  The \\"funeral\\" for Data was also very touching.  Three of the main characters - Riker and Troi, and Crusher - depart the Enterprise at the conclusion of the film; more on that in a minute.<br /><br />For the era (circa 2002) and the relatively small budget, the special effects in Nemesis are great.  The space battle between the Enterprise and the Scimitar is awesome.  I enjoyed the scenes on Romulus with the Romulan Senate, as well as the Romulan characters and their relationship to their once Reman slaves.  Speaking of the Remans, this was a very enjoyable introduction.  There is a scene in the Enterprise conference lounge that acknowledges the Federation has been aware of the Remans for some time, despite their first appearance in this film.<br /><br />While \\"Nemesis\\" succeeds on several levels, it also fails on several more.  First, too much of the film was cut.  We know from the wedding scene that Commander Riker has been command of a new starship, the Nova Class Starship Titan, and that his new bride, Counselor Troi, is accompanying him.  What you don't see in the film - and you won't know if you don't watch the deleted scenes or know anything about the Star Trek universe - is that Dr. Beverly Crusher is also leaving the Enterprise to once again helm Starfleet Medical.  While this departure is short-lived (in the succeeding original Star Trek novels she returns to the Enterprise and subsequently marries Picard), I always wondered why her goodbye scene with Picard is never shown.  Also, other than a few scenes in sickbay and one very \\"clinical\\" private scene with Picard, Crusher is once again given NOTHING to do.  Gates McFadden is a great actress and Beverly Crusher and Captain Picard have a rich history; since this film was billed as \\"a generation's final journey\\" the writers and the director failed big time here.  This was the perfect opportunity to finally bring these characters together.  Next, LeVar Burton's character Geordi La Forge is also shafted.  He has a few scenes with Data - he was lucky enough to get more scenes than Crusher - but Geordi was Data's best friend.  Other than acknowledging Data's cat Spot had chosen Worf as its new master, Geordi was not properly allowed to say goodbye to Data.  Finally, WHY is Worf still the security chief of the Enterprise?  He came back after \\"Insurrection\\" as the security chief (in \\"First Contact\\" and \\"Insurrection\\" his character was \\"on loan\\" as \\"Deep Space Nine\\" was still on the air), but why?  He was the strategic operations officer on DS9, and the Federation ambassador to the Klingon home world. Isn't going back to being the Security Chief on a starship a career step backwards?<br /><br />Yes I realize my gripes do not really detract from the overall story - unless you are a diehard Trekkie.  This film had the potential to be amazing, instead it was just a \\"good film.\\"
B00B2LPYNE|4.0|The Divinity of Purpose is a very good Hardcore/Metal album. The lyrics are as movitational as ever, especially on tunes like Own Your World. I would definitely recommend anyone to pick this album up.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I did not go into this film with as much dreaded anticipation as I did its predecessor.  There were a lot of things to like and dislike about 'Star Trek Into Darkness,' but overall the film is very enjoyable.  I first watched it back in May in the theater, and again this past weekend after purchasing the Blu-Ray.  The spoilers for this film really put me off, I will admit.  Is he (the deliciously brilliant Benedict Cumberbatch) Khan, is he John Harrison?  After a while I became bored with all the speculation.<br /><br />The payoff - and let down - is that he's both, and I won't say more than that.  Remember that Abrams' reboot series exists within an alternate universe separate from that Roddenberry and his successors created, so the old rules don't apply.<br /><br />The opening sequence of the film is absolutely brilliant, with only one real letdown.  The opening sequence consists of Kirk (Chris Pine) and McCoy (Karl Urban) on a very lush and colorful planet (called Nibiru) running from very alien-looking primitive natives.  Elsewhere, Spock (Zach Quinto), Sulu (John Cho), and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) are attempting to deactivate a very violent volcano that's about to erupt and would eventually eradicate this burgeoning species.  The opening sequence, while it has nothing to do with the rest of the film, touches on one of the basic tenets of the entire Trek mythology and if Abrams' team is smart they will come back to this in future films.  My only gripe is that the crew has submerged the Enterprise under the planet's ocean to observe this primitive species.  First, a ship of the Enterprise's design and configuration could not enter an atmosphere much less be submerged in water.  If you are a diehard Trekkie you have to suspend your disbelief on that one.  Second, why do they need to be underwater to observe this culture or render the active volcano inert?  This is a primitive culture with no real technology ... they aren't going to a detect a ship in orbit.<br /><br />The plot for 'Into Darkness' is very well-conceived.  While I was disappointed they decided to take a classic Trek film (The Wrath of Khan) and some elements of TOS (John Harrison, a frequently used minor character) and even DS9 (Section 31), they took the references and twisted them into something unique so that the story felt fresh.  The inclusion of the character of Carol Marcus (Alice Eve), obviously much younger than when we met her in TWOK, added an extra dimension to the story's second villain, the war-hungry Starfleet Admiral who sought out war with the Klingons.  As in the 2009 film, each of the \\"main characters\\" received something important to do.  McCoy, Scotty (Simon Pegg), Sulu, and Checkov (Anton Yelchin) once again take a back seat to Kirk/Spock/Uhura, but each character is paid enough attention so that you don't feel they're just taking up space.  The inclusion of Carol Marcus as a member of the Enterprise crew at the end of the film, when the ship embarks on it's \\"historic five-year mission\\" is a nice surprise.  Clearly this was set up as a romantic plot-point for Kirk in the next film.<br /><br />I will say I hope for the third installment of the reboot series Abrams does not borrow elements from previous films.  I don't want to see anymore characters from the established Gene Roddenberry universe.  Abrams created the perfect set-up with his alternate universe, and since the end of this film shows the Enterprise embarking on its original \\"five-year mission\\" I'm sure there's a lot of original stories that would excite fans.  Before I close, there are two things I must mention.  First, the Klingons did not need a makeover.  They don't look menacing at all. Why did the Klingons need to be redone?  It's like remaking the Romulans in the last film.  The Klingons from The Next Gen/DS9/Voyager era look far more menacing than these \\"glistening creatures.\\"  Second, the utilization of Leonard Nimoy was cheap and did nothing for the story.  If Spock Prime appears in the next film it needs to be sending him home to his own universe.  Keeping two Spocks in one universe is dumb.<br /><br />Overall I am giving this film five stars, because despite the minor plot holes the film is engaging and held my interest.  Abrams and Co. do a great job of continuing the story they began in 2009's 'Star Trek' reboot.
0399165274|5.0|Thrilling, exciting and simply excellent, however the ending is not as dramatic as most of this author's books typically are.
0756686970|4.0|I bought this for one of my sons for his fifth birthday. He is a lego maniac.  On top of that, he loves Star Wars. This book and my son are a match made in heaven. The book has large, full color pictures and small captions describing the character and some of his traits and abilities. Being a DK book, the text is easy to read (uses larger fonts and well placed captions) and easy to follow.  Our book came with a little Han Solo Minifig which has since been removed and played with.<br /><br />Here are the only problems, the binding is a tad weak and some pages have fallen out (although, I think my son played a small role in that... but I cannot tell as the spine does seem to be weak). Second, the price. It seems a bit high for such a short book (its thick, but half of its girth is for packaging the minifig).<br /><br />Overall, if you have a lego maniac or love lego Star Wars, this is a decent book, especially if you can find it on sale.

B000VDUWMC|3.0|This book is a great example of both the intelligence and stupidity of university professors. It has a number of clever ideas in it that make it worth reading, but it also has a number of knee-slappers where the author says things that only an ivory tower elitist who basically looks down on others (especially his own culture) could say.  Good summaries of silly statements provided in other one-star reviews. Some of the fawning five-star reviews are funny because their writers aspire to be oikophobes (oikophobiacs?) themselves.

0307271609|5.0|With every new insight of the most historical figures of the past, there is renewed interest and understanding with much depth of figures that contributed to the major advancements of a country and people.  This is the sentiment after reading Jung Chang's Empress Dowager:  The Concubine Who Launched Modern China.  Chang places much emphasis upon two points that somewhat debunks past presentations of who Empress Dowager really was as a leader and how she may have contributed to the fall of China's Qing Dynasty.  For many years, Cixi has been portrayed as a ruthless leader, but this picture of a woman that held China's empire together may have been tainted by great revolutions in China from the end of the Qing up to Mao Zedong's cultural revolution.  Within this biographical and historical narrative, Cixi is painted within a different vein as a strong-willed leader respecting China's cultural traditions as well as preserving traditions of the Middle Kingdom within a powerful empire that experienced major transitions from outside regions and allies, especially the United Kingdom and the United States prior the end of her reign.<br /><br />Chang addresses and retells of Cixi's active role to move China forward toward modernity, which begins with her birth and her gradual rise to power.  This is twofold in terms of explaining or contradicting what has already been written about the Qing period and Cixi's role.  First, the attempt to preserve China's traditions as its leader after the death of the \\"Masters of Ten Thousand Years,\\" Emperor Xianfeng and succession to the throne his son Tongzhi, and her somewhat period of supervising her adopted son and child Emperor Guangxu.  Second, how she allied and worked with the most innovative figures within and outside the imperial court.  And it is the latter, the key figures of Cixi's court, Grand Council Prince Gong and Prince Chu, Chief Negotiator Earl Li that led the country towards peace and prosperity through productive means, Self-Strengthening and industrialization.  And with the rise in population growth that amounted by the time the dynasty ended to over 200 million people and migrations of peoples to and from neighboring regions, these events contributed to maintaining economic growth through trade and social and political alliances.  With much interest, these instances show how Cixi maintained relations with individuals from the United States and Great Britain as well as France to provide this growth to occur, Thomas Wade, Soldier of Fortune and 39 year-old American Frederick Townsend Ward, English Officer Charles Gordon, Robert Hart from Belfast and was the Chinese Maritime Customs Officer.  In essence, Cixi worked with a group of individuals that made it possible for China to attempt to balance and not to disturb its cultural traditions.<br /><br />The title of the book is quite fitting to describe the achievements that occurred during China's last dynasty and eventually mark its entrance into the modern era.  Chang shows how Cixi's power and wealth but most importantly, how these traits transgressed as a whole to establishing the foundations of a modern China while preserving the dynasty and its past of an empire that endured a tremendous amount of adversities and upheavals in its over 200 year existence.Self-Strengthening and industrialization.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A gripping story line. I absolutely love the Crowleys.  Each character is important in their own right and shows personal growth.  Although the staff have their problems to deal with , the same is for the family, and they help and support each other through the good and the bad.  Can't wait for season four.hmm

B00BEIYOHC|1.0|If you were a fan of the first one don't see this one. It should be called the last chapter not chapter 2. The director hit the first insidious and the conjuring out of the park I guess 2 out of three isn't bad. I don't need to go into the same details everyone else did. But save your money to rent or if you are a movie collector like myself and will buy it just because you have the first one wait and rent it from redbox or for it to hit the five dollar bin at Walmart trust me it will be there quick.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|While this seasons point was 2 create the setting for the later seasons that followed (which are also all really great!) and also 2 give you a first glimpse at the characters that would radically change over the course of a few seasons. Walter White is a chemistry teacher who is dealt a very dreadful hand, CANCER! And now with limited time on Earth he comes up with a scheme 2 support his family and even his grandchilderen for future family generations! Cook some meth! This season really opened the door too this great show and sort of dispalyed what these characters were all like before they really broke bad! ;)
B00AFEXRME|4.0|The acting is solid, and I've never seen Denzel Washington disappoint, but the real strength of this movie is the story, especially its ambiguities: the pilot truly saves the day, yet the event exposes his problem with substance abuse; the plane's mechanical failure is called an 'Act of God' and there are other religious elements, yet the pilot seems doubtful about religion and God; the pilot's union defends the pilot, despite knowing of his substance abuse; the pilot can't bear telling one more lie about his substance abuse and thus goes to jail, yet he could have gone just as clean after telling that one more lie to stay out of jail and be perceived as a hero by most.  The one criticism I'll offer is that the movie opens with explicit female nudity, but this is just an obvious ploy to hook the male audience and the movie doesn't need it.  But otherwise, I found this to be an enjoyable movie, particularly given my professional and personal interest in failure investigations and associated human factors.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|As my title suggest. Walter White at this point in the series is starting too look more like scareface than Mr. Chips! The series takes another dark turn as Walt is given an offer he cannot refuse working in a state of the art high tech lab making his pure blue gold!!! Once again this season has a lot of the same great aspects as the previous seasons from the cast, writing, and overall production of the show is still very good. The writing in this season is very good when it comes too the numerous plot twists that erupt and spin through out the season! In this season there are a ton of \\"close calls\\" where it appears that a characters time is about too end or the show is gonna take a very negative turn, but then it suddenly changes but also seems believable and never fails 2 entertain the audience! You also see the greater depth of the characters as each one of them begins too evolve with the radical changes that are occuring all around them!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|A  most insightful and heartbreaking story. Keyes' powerful story delves into the human psyche and deals with the fundamental existential questions of rejection and acceptance of self and by others.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Vince Gilligan's master piece is taken too a whole new level! What made the first season so good is multiplied in this season! Everything from the writing, acting, cinematography, music, the atmosphere! The production on this series is made too a very high standard. I know some people like this season less than the 1st one, I will say they both have there high and low points. This season starts off with high energy and a bit of action, then it slows down 2 mid tempo and towards the end things really pick up again with a really insane, dark, dismal, and bizarre cliff hanger. Can't spoil much in this review, lets just say in this season Walt really finds out how deep \\"this business\\" he is in really is, and what it might take 2 make it big in it ;)

B00BH0VSM6|3.0|The book is correctly structured, but it's just average... I expected it to be at the level of a Larsson, but it was quite a disappointment.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love it, but I've loved the whole series so far so that's kinda a given I guess. I will say that this book seems to move a little slower than others. It feels like a lot of setup, like Martin is just winding up that trebuchet. Also Danerys et al. are not in this book as the stories mostly focus on what's going down in Westeros.
B00B780TAK|5.0|Oh Downton Abby Why cant this family have joy without some great tragedy soon fallowing! Not Matthew too! I'm hooked but how many more deaths after birth can this show have? It may be that I'm still too upset to appreciate the writing or maybe not.

B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Backgammon is all about doubling and probable rolls of the dice...This is fast and great play.  A well designed app on my KFire.

B0082A3HTQ|5.0|I loved this movie.  My husband loved the movie and we are planning to watch it again and again.  I could understand why the caretaker was chosen above others and why he was missed.  We thought that we weren't going to like the subtitles, but they were no problem at all. We pray that all is going well for he and his family........
B00D5EWRHW|5.0|I ran across this band in the free music section of artists on the rise.  I got She Wants to Know along with several others by different artists.  I turned the new music on and after hearing their song, had to look up more.  After listening to a few track samples I decided to take a chance on the album and I'm so glad I did.  The sound is a rich blend of harmonies with alternating haunting (No More Losing the War) and upbeat (Call Me in the Afternoon) instrumentation.  Immediately reminded me of Radiohead The Bends-era.  Highly recommend giving the album a chance.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B009EFP278|5.0|I love British music and having recently discovered Olly, I would highly recommend giving his music a listen!  I have been listening to this almost non-stop in my car to and from work since I bought it and it really puts me in a great mood!  The song &#34;Dance with Me Tonight&#34; is practically set on repeat!  If you love Robbie Williams (who should be way more popular in the US), then give Olly a try!
1476733953|5.0|I've been reading for many years and have indulged in many qenres.  I've frequently read others' reviews of books that they loved.  This one really wowed me.  The characters are well developed and believable; the pace moves along quickly and never slows.  And while Mr. Howey sets his story in the future, postapocalypse, in an environment that is totally new and foreign, these modifiers aren't as important as the characters, their motives and decisions.  None of his characters is all good or all bad.  Even &#34;the bad guy&#34;, Bernard, has made understandable decisions and the reader can feel somewhat sympathetic toward him.  However, his better qualities don't shine for very long, as evidenced when he feels challenged by Lukas', his young protege's, questions.<br /><br />I have to admit that I read this large tomb late into the night, finishing it in three days.  Even TV and NPR held no temptations!  I would not ascribe this book with &#34;fantasy or scifi&#34; classifications.  It goes well beyond the limitations of these genres.  I would describe it as an awakening of the human spirit, disillusionment, groping for truth through one's own lenses, and finally coming to an understanding within one's self.<br /><br />I find I'm not able to express what it is about this book that has so moved me....I guess you'll just have to read it and find out for yourselves!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|This is a band that I recently discovered and I really love them.  I loved this album so much that I plan on going back and buying their earlier releases.  I would highly recommend this band.  They have such a unique sound!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple, intuitive, and an amazing price. Chromecast is the best. I can not wait for the software updates to come.
B00DJYK9ZU|5.0|This is a band I recently discovered and I love them!  They have a great sound and I can totally hear the influence of Paul Simon's &#34;Graceland&#34; and &#34;Rhythm of the Saints&#34; when I listen to their music.  I would highly recommend checking out this band.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Fun and challenging. always more to do takes a long time to advance but we'll worth it can play forever
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|A seemingly simple death turns into a murder.  David Tennant plays the investigating officer battling with his new team and his inner demons from a previous case.  The small town begins to tear itself apart as the investigation drags on.
B000O179EA|1.0|Well, crap.  I have a brand-new Sony Bluray/DVD player in my house, and it won't play this disc.<br /><br />I guess it's because this is am &#34;HD DVD&#34; and not a standard DVD.  I have 400+ regular DVDs that play perfectly well.<br /><br />Since I waited a long while before trying to use this disc, I am sure I'm past the return date.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|So far this is a very compelling book, sharing the history of the time period in which Jesus Christ lived, the political situation of the region and why it was necessary for him to be there at that time!  Well written, can't wait to finish it.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I am a Jane Austen fan and enjoy collecting different versions of DVDs made from her books.  This is a very good version of Persuasion.  The producers understood the characters, and the two main actors were very good.
B0049M7BDE|5.0|This movie is wonderfully acted, wonderfully edited and is a great edition to your video library. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo shine in this fast-paced film.
B0041D843M|5.0|A must read !!!<br />But be aware this book may change your way of living forever !<br />It certainly has influenced a lot of people to do so - me included (I changed from being a vegetarian for 30 years to become a vegan)
B005O7PXNS|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love anything that has Nathan Fillion in it.  Ever since we saw the Firefly Series, we find any and everything with him in it--and watch it.  He is absolutely witty in everything that he does and has a way of capturing your heart during dramatic interludes.  This series does not disappoint.  It has an amazing cast and a very well written script.  It has everything from drama to comedy and romance and I love the little things that just happen between characters like Castle and his daughter is very endearing.  I have three girls who also love and watch Castle with us and I hope they take Molly Quinn's portrayel of Castle's daughter Alexis as their real life role model.  I recommend this series for all age groups, it is a series worth watching.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I tried so many times to upload videos from my tablet, but I could not. I could only upload photos.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is my new favorite author. I seriously couldn't put this book down. This has such a mysterious plot and back story.  I loved the main character and felt everything he felt going through the book. Definitely recommending this book and author to my friends,family and facebook!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Game is very fun but the token system without purchasin them is a big problem and the most I got from the scratch off is only three.<br /> very slow.  Game itself is very good
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game, and am very addicted to it.  I just wish it has a few changes, like the building that take cash...you can accidentally click on it and bam, the money is gone.  It would be nice if it has a pop-up that says &#34;Are you sure?&#34;  Also, I hit a glitch that took some cash and made a building just disappear.  I have contacted customer service but have not heard from them for THIS game which I guess is fine, since I think that it is just having some issues because I have a Kindle Fire.  My husband has an IPAD and has had zero issues, and also has an option to earn free cash back, which on my device I do not.  It is still a great game.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This item is not supported in my country and i can't dowload the setup from Googleplay. In our age of WiFi and world Google, I can't use this gadget. So i will bay small android dongle  from China for the same purposes.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is an easier alternative for your tablet.  This is self explanatory I believe.  If not, then download the app and make your life easier!
B00C0K6NUY|5.0|This is the second of Graham's Katie Maguire books. Having read the first and really enjoyed it I dove into the next one.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book and found it a page turner. It is however, fairly gruesome in parts.<br /><br />A great character in Katie, I hope there's another in the series!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|The way this is written is such that it does not promote a divided sense between understanding and believing. Ender knew that understanding was the most powerful form of empathy that humanity could ever hold, that this book holds it in high regard tells of the author's wisdom.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Nice app. The white noise is a little irritating as it must be on a loop and you can tell when it is repeating.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Very gripping, intense and scary! Definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it and you like suspense.  I don't normally get into zombie movies but this one is a cut above the rest.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Good game overall. Better on android you have the option to save your file on a cloud or compete in weekly tournaments.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love it when I see stuff flying everywhere it's the most fun game in the world and you will love it!
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Love the Reacher books in general, but find it irksome when Mr. Child gets technical and gets it wrong. In several of the books he talks about how powerful a 9mm pistol round is.  The 9mm parabellum that he touts as being so powerful is actually at the bottom of the range of acceptable stopping power for handgun cartridges.  The 40 S&W and 45 ACP cartridges are substantially more effective, but when Reacher gets a hold of a 45 ACP handgun in M1911 form, he dismisses it in spite of this fact.  The spec ops guys have gone back to the M1911 style pistols for their work. Most law enforcement has gone to the S&W 40 cal. I know many folks don't care about this stuff, but it's like the media reporting on a multiple homicide like the Navy Yards and get the details wrong.  If you're going to get technical, get it right.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I got this app for free earlier this year, and I use it nearly every night. I'm prone to bouts of anxiety and being unable to sleep, and the variety of sounds helps me to relax. Love it!
B00B7PIRIE|1.0|i loved every bit of this movie  and i recommend this movie for every one and i am waiting for the 4th series to come on
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I honestly can't believe this is going to be turned into a major motion picture! Most of the movie will have to be made up because there is no good story line to follow.  I purchased this book because I was curious what the buzz was about and wanted to judge the book for myself.  I was prepared for the raunchy sex scenes and basic plot of the story based on what I heard from family and friends that have read the book.  What I was not prepared for was the intense lack of story and purpose of this book.  Seriously it's a book about a girl who meets an emotionally screwed up billionaire and they toss around the idea of a BDSM relationship. There is no other content in this book that constitutes a good story.  How many books are written about that? TONS, and half of them are written better than this book.  I'm sorry, but I was just dissapointed in this book greatly. I expected a lot more than what I received, but this is only my review.  Read the book for yourself and you be the judge.
1857885082|3.0|I wasn't so crazy about this book.  The subject matter was interesting enough, but it was a bit dry for me.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|the film is about the unfulfilled dreams of broken hopes the film is about the people who are the people in the not-human conditions
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This is one of my favorite TV shows all-time and I am 50 years old! I feel it gives credence to being young and intelligence as well as actively promotes science and math. 2 subject matters that are far from being promoted in today's science; however, desperatelyneeded, more so than ever, in today's world. Not to mentioned it's damn funny!
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I expected a little more from him. It was good but not great. Ill listen to it more maybe ill change my mind.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|A book that will stick with me for a long time. It might even be a book I will re read a few times.
B00DPKQ60A|4.0|The first time I heard \\"The Way,\\" Ariana Grande's first single from her album Yours Truly, I was convinced I was listening to the legendary vocalist and pop star, Mariah Carey. The tone quality and control of this petit twenty-year-old's vocals are simply enough to keep you listening to her breakout hit featuring the Rap artist, Mac Miller. If Grande's talent is not enough to draw your complete attention, enter her name into an internet search engine and discover how captivatingly beautiful she is.<br /><br />Grande began her career not as a singer, but acting as Cat Valentine in the popular Nickelodeon show, Victorious. Her trademark loose curls and half-up, half-down red-dyed hair style may be what placed her on the up-and-comers map, but her new music in Yours Truly will be what catapults her to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 charts. As Grande left behind her red hair to embrace a more natural brunette look, music fans greeted her first, second, and third singles warmly, granting Grande her a solid fan-base to pursue a career in music.<br /><br />Each song featured in Yours Truly has a specific, soulful and relaxed, yet fun, vibe to them. Whether you listen to \\"Tattooed Heart,\\" \\"Honeymoon Avenue,\\" or \\"Almost Is Never Enough,\\" no doubt you will be swaying your head from side to side on beat to the snaps in the instrumental. Every note, including some very high G's, Grande sings is reached perfectly. The riffs she attempts in almost every song are impressively flawless and assimilate to Beyoncé's popular vocal runs.<br /><br />The tracks \\"Lovin' It\\" and \\"Piano\\" prove Grande's versatility. Each represent differing styles of Pop music and both determine the singer's possible musical ventures. Several of the songs sound very similar--instrumental snaps and an old-time mood and a little variety goes a long way. Both songs are largely more upbeat and contain a happier, more optimistic quality. There is no doubt that while listening to these songs, your emotions willupgrade from indifferent to content.<br /><br />Although it is important to create a specific trademark sound for a new artist, too many of Ariana's tracks sound similar. Each involves a cappella sounding background vocals with a slow beat. Rap artists Mac Miller and Big Sean are featured in Yours Truly and this is an excellent example of variety that is needed in the album. I would recommend the next album to consider more upbeat music and maybe some dance-inspired tracks. Ariana's voice would do very well in a heavy bass, R&B stimulated song. Because many fans are calling her the new Mariah Carey, Ariana can definitely accomplish similar feats as Carey.<br /><br />If you enjoy Mariah Carey, I would absolutely recommend listening to Yours Truly. Her voice quality is very similar to Ariana's. A few other artists to listen to would be Megan & Liz, Ryan Beatty, and Megan Nicole, who were all made famous on YouTube, Rita Ora and Big Time Rush. This listener is excited to watch Grande win honors at award shows and will definitely keep tabs on her future musical endeavors.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|I wanted to look at a lot of my old &#34;home movies&#34; to see which ones I wanted convert to DVD's but on most of the tapes there was no picture at all and on a few tapes it was very snowy.  I was ready to take the camcorder in for repairs but thought I'd try the cleaning tape.  I popped the tape in for the required time and voila - all my tapes had great pictures!  I was amazed at the results and I'm sure I saved at least $100 in &#34;repairs&#34; if I'd taken it into a shop.
0452295548|5.0|This is an excellent book, extremely informative and well written showing clearly the differences between the left and right hemispheres of the brain in language simple enough for any one to understand.  It is of great value as it demonstrates the real value and importance of our right hemisphere - left brain behavior.
B0086449YA|5.0|The more I listen to this album the more I really like it.  So give it a chance and you will be impressed.
0399165274|4.0|I am a sucker for a good story and &#34;The Kill List&#34; was worth the wait. The characters, although extreme, have believable  and compelling attitudes which never fail to either make me angry or stir accolades for their bravery. It is a - let down - when you finish the story.  As even in today's news, terrorism dominates, and you feel like Mr Forsyth's heroes are required.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|Every entry in the Mission Impossible series has been unique and different from each other. In the fourth film they've dropped the number and added a cool subtitle. The way I see it Ethan Hunt has been created to be an American version of a James Bond with the gadgets (particularly in this one) mixed with a little Jason Bourne (even though the first MI came out before the first Bourne). I feel like I'm one of the last people out there who really likes Tom Cruise. I mean, how could you not like the guy? He's a fantastic actor, does his own stunts and never backs down from a challenge. The biggest problem I found in this film was the simplicity in the plot. I personally liked the 3rd film better, a few more twists and intense sequences, this one relied mostly on stunts.
B005PW3OS8|2.0|This movie was intended to be a serious action adventure movie, but I ended up laughing at many of the scenes that were just too ridiculous to be believable.  Probably the funniest scene was when Captain America was sneaking around an enemy compound wearing a bright red white and blue uniform.  If you are not going to dress up in an enemy uniform, you would at least wear camouflage or something that didn't draw attention.  LAUGHABLE!
1423136802|4.0|We ordered this for a Christmas present for our son (4th grade).  He has read 2 of the books so far and really enjoyed them.  I like that it comes in a box that lets us keep all the books together as a set.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Loved the magic and twists along the way. If you like movies that make you think and entertain watch this.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|I so enjoyed this version of &#34;Persuasion&#34; that I find myself using it as a stick for measuring other versions I come accross.  Particularly lover the musical score.  I wish it was available for purchase...
B009RH9J7W|1.0|It does not stand up very well. And it left marks on the screen of my Kindle where the band wraps around to secure it shut.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I am delighted to read a story to fill in spaces in Miles' timeline. And so happy to see Ivan come out ahead of the game.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I have viewed Avatar in a Theater when it first came out and really liked the movie. So I decided to add it to my video library. The package arrived in a timely manor and in good condition as expected. I enjoyed viewing the movie again.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received my Chromecast last week and was excited to connection and get started. I had a little trouble getting it set up to my home network, but I have been having network issue for a few weeks (I need to get Comcast out.<br /><br />My first impression of the Chromecast was it has a nice clear picture and nice screen save which displays the date and time I believe and background picture changes according to the time of day. I was able to set my Netflix up and watch a movie. I liked watching Netflix via the Chromecast because I was able to get a clearer HD picture. Before I was watching Netflix on the same 60in LED HDTV via my bluray player.<br /><br />Over I'm happy with the Chromecast, but am looking forward to seeing new apps for it.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|I am continually surprised by the X-Men series.  I anticipated predictable storyline of the eye-rolling kind.  Predictable, some parts sure, like you know they are going to form the X-Men, but I didn't realize there would be real drama like finding out how Professor X got into that wheelchair.  Totally worth a Saturday night viewing, especially now that the NYC movie-theater prices are beyond eye-rolling at $15!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie was fabulous as well as the first one was. All the characters play their parts real well. I wasn't a Star Trek fan on anything but the movies. I didn't watch the series so not sure how these match. The graphics are fantastic and characters are awesome with a fantastic story line. I had heard there were 3 in this series. I hope that is true. Glad I bought the bluray.
B000IMKDPC|4.0|I am not sure if it was better than I expected because my standards for action films has gone so low but I enjoyed this movie.  Some parts were predictable of course, but with life so frighteningly unpredictable I suppose it is not so bad knowing what comes next it in a film.  Especially when it is Hugh Jackman in tight-fitting clothes!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I normally don't write reviews for movies unless I think they are really bad. This movie was great. I haven't read the book though I heard it was better. But isn't that always the case. I thought Brad Pitt played an excellent part. I felt like my heart was racing the whole time I was watching this movie. Talk about zombies on crack too. Wow they are not slow in this movie they are speed demons. With that being said this was well worth the watch and the money. I am glad i bought the blu ray I'll definitely be watching this again.
B00ADS98FC|3.0|I ordered this for my daughter and a friend and figured it would be heavy on the cheese. I was right. However it also had cute moments and funny moments and &#34;awww&#34; moments.  Unfortunately, it also contained questionable, inappropriate moments that were NOT tucked into that &#34;right over her ten year old head&#34; place.  I don't believe in raising  a child in a bubble so those moments weren't  quite raunchy enough to fast forward or stop it all together.  Overall, it was cute enough to watch it with them ( the friend is 13) and get in some quality time.  I think it is important to show interest in what your children are interested in even if it is a sappy teen film.  Mission accomplished.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Terrific read! Don't worry about the length--so well written--just loved it! Highly recommend to anyone who loves to read and learn.
B00F2362IE|5.0|Teenage Mutant Ninja Fun on the Toliet, Bus, Plane, Where ever!!! I love the turtles more then life itself. Being g a long life hardcore fan, This game is right up any turtle lovers alley. Ran into some trouble in the beginning with play, but I freed up some space on my Kindle and it now works like a charm. So those haters that give this a 1 star, it's probably because you have too many useless apps on your tablet. This app is not one of them. Ninja Turtles for life!!!!!!

B0040FMG2G|5.0|And moreover, it is a drama that has heart, a great soundtrack, good acting, and an element of genuine history, despite its fictional basis.  Well worth watching.
0744014956|3.0|I typically do not buy strategy guides because most of the time they are useless. This one proved my point once again.<br /><br />-First it did not cover any online content.<br />-It did not cover the stock market or what to \\"Invest\\" in when doing the assassination missions.<br />-There was no clothes inside, on the GTA san andreas one it listed their clothes and how much they cost ect.<br />-They did not show any secret locations of any cars<br />-They did not put the \\"Cost\\" you gain from secret packages.<br /><br />Personally unless you really want to know what is going on in the main story mission I would not waste your money on this book.

B00991TCOG|5.0|Really liked this CD, my only complaint is that my speakers cannot handle it when it's cranked up. I first saw her on Youtube and had to have this CD, I know some people do not really like what she does but I find the mix of her playing and the modern heavy bass beats on some tracks to be very interesting. This is often playing as background music at my place

B008RA3X5E|3.0|It works fine and is better than most alarm clocks but lookout flags this as adware that collects personal info.  This version does have ads but only for their other apps.  I'M not sure if it's a false positive but it seems to be ok for now.  Just be aware that this could just be really popular and good functioning malware
B000F1IQMS|5.0|The movie was brilliantly cast and had me sitting on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.  Such a marvelous portrayal of the much larger picture of &#34;counter-terrorism&#34;.  This movie stays with you and still makes me think to this very day.  The best movies transcend art and become greater than the sum of their parts.  This movie does just that.  BRAVO.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This series is a great one with wonderful actors.  It is really great to be able to watch all of season two without having to wait weeks to see it all.
0451419243|3.0|I loved Fall of Giants because the idea is so great!  A \\"century trilogy\\" about intertwined families and the events that shaped the world around them -wow!<br /><br />But... the repetetive descriptive sex scenes detracted from the seriousness of what was going on around them.  Winter of the World reads like a romance novel for women of a certain age.  I was hoping for something meatier and deeper.  I was also hoping for more character development of Grigori, Senator Dewar and Rosa and the characters from the first novel.  A good novel if you are looking for distraction on a crowded beach, I guess.<br /><br />Mr. Follet, your publishers are talking you into wading in the shallow end to sell more books.  Please don't pander to the masses, it's so boring! I love the depth of Edward Rutherford.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|I have always been a fan of plague games, especially the Pandemic series on the internet. I saw this on the amazon app store for $1 and decided that it wouldn't be much of a loss. 3 weeks later and I have probably put over 40 hours into this game. The variety of symptoms and disease types make it so no two games are the same.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoy seeing the culture; and social interactions of the era. I like seeing the beautiful costumes. I try to unravel some of the plots before they occur.Character study is also a hobby for me, so there are surely enough &#34;characters&#34; to engage with.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|I am sitting here trying to find an explanation for what the writers of this series did with the last season. I was a HUGE fan of this series. Dexter, together with Breaking Bad were the two best series I have ever watched, but then they had to ruin Dexter in Season 8. The problems started early, since right from the beginning of the season the episodes were dull and boring. Dexter was a different character and things were moving really slow. It felt like the writers did not really know where the story was going and with each episode they were changing their mind. This left us with a bland and unsatisfying plot.<br /><br />Of course, there was no way I was going to stop watching one of my favorite shows, so I kept plugging away and watching each week. At the end of each episode I would feel like things were wrong, but I did not want to believe that things were this bad. Surely they were going to find a way to make it up to us and to deliver a grand finale that would make us forget. And indeed they did, but not in the way I was expecting. They gave us a final episode that does not make us forget their mistakes, they gave us one that makes us want to forget this season even existed.<br /><br />I have a hard time to believe that fans of this series can be satisfied with this final season. It did not have even a hint of what made me love this series for many years, and felt truly like an afterthought. The ending is as anti-climatic and bland as one can be. I am truly baffled. Rant over!
B00CR1DX9A|5.0|Always tongue in cheek, this story had me laughing out loud on the train on my way to work in the mornings. There is an element of mystery to the storyline, but it's just good fun to be honest. The characters were all great, even the 'bad guys' who were parodies of real politicians and greedy lawyers. The hero, Bobby, was a bit of a wet blanket - but that worked well and allowed his two sidekicks, Maggie and Guy, to shine through. Overall, it is entertaining and easy light-reading that should put a smile on your face.
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Once again i was unable to watch this through my xbox360, the video would buffer  or say amazon instant video was unavailable.
B00BEOYPCK|5.0|Best Kurt Vile album I have heard to date.  Every song can stand on their own and it really is a great listen all the way through.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie! A bit slow at first but picks up quickly. I would recommend it for the drama lovers!
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I barely remembered what happened in this movie from when I watched it as a kid. However, my husband had expressed interest in watching it again from his childhood. After we watched it together, we loved it. It's full of magic and laughter and fun. I love adventures, and this one was great. Great for adults and children!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game<br />love this game....tons of fun to play. its fun to play with horses and compete in competitions.<br />love it!
B00DU74U74|5.0|The story line of this movie takes a different turn regarding the traditional &#34;Alien Invasion&#34; story line. It is a post invasion story from the point of view of one of the invading aliens that becomes a sympathizer.
B009UNGYHG|3.0|Wear and tare a little less than a year made this blue tooth inoperable. This simply shouldn't be expensive as it is if it cant last at least a year.
B003O86FMW|5.0|'re-reading for the movie release. Can't wait. Books are always better, so I will probably read it again after the movie.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|It put me to sleep. Since I need fifteen words, I will say it again, it put me to sleep.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|What can i say, it's J Mayer - a phenomonal musician with an awesome sound. I enjoyed this CD, took a little time to grow on me - but I like it. It's a must have to add to your J Mayer collection.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this app. Its just the right balance of points without spending money. I really enjoy playing while winding down for the day.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Alien has always been one of my all time favorite sci-fi movies.  Being able to get it at such a low price is unheard of.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book wasn't what I was expecting. It was surprisingly strange and a bit familiar. I liked it and recommend it to teens.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|very intertaining if you like action. No comptor special effects. Real  action sceans and outstanding driving and stunts. enjoyed this movie, will watch again.
B00EMJD6TC|1.0|This is a zombie movie (with Brad Pitt and needless children) that has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REAL WORLD WAR Z book or audio.  It is Ok to watch, but Return immediately after viewing... i'ts not that good.  Acting is poor, casting it terrible, and again, has NOTHING TO DO with the real WORLD WAR Z.<br /><br />As a Zombie movie, I would give it a C-.  Expecting World War Z, I give it an F- or worse if possible.<br /><br />Amazon will not let me return this worthless coaster until I have received the rest of my order.  That's OK, I will wait.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Its a show with definitely a large amount of drama. Constant situations that always keep you guessing.<br />Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose. Character development on this show is fantastic.<br />One reason I love to watch shows is to see characters (change) and (evolve) over time from circumstances. Just about every character on the show has changed and had something affect how they portray there characters.<br /><br />A must see!
B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|Glad she still singing.  This Cd sounds more like some her older stuff that I enjoyed.  Keep singing sheryl crow
B005PK57NU|5.0|I have enjoyed catching up on episodes missed, since I have been busy with kids and life in general lately.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Once again Pendergast has me enthralled. Non stop tension. Hard to put down, you want to race ahead and see what happens next!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I'm almost caught up and I love the Alicia coming out of her shell. Looking forward to more to come
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love this book. I believe it! I know it's all true. But, just like becoming really good at soccer, you have to practice. Practice. Practice. This is something I didn't learn about till Tony Robbins taught me. Your brain is a muscle and just like other muscles in your body, you have to work it out, pump it up, take care of it. Practice happiness. Practice love, and you will see it more often in your life.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Well I bought this CD just because I like the band. Plus it's not too bad of a price if you want the cd and the downloadable version, i recommend getting the cd if u love the band.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Le Carre can draw the picture of a character or a scene in a few deft strokes. Whether they are people of good will trying to do an honest job, mendacious opportunists or outright scoundrels, Le Carre brings them all to vivid life. As always he tantalizes with flash backs and  snippets of scenes that hook the reader like an elusive trout in a fast-running stream. He twitches that line and slowly, inexorably reels us in. His mastery of the craft is undiminished. To those who thought his time was up when the Cold War ended, think again.<br />Unlike Alfred Hitchcock, we, the audience of readers don't know more than the characters do as the plot unfolds. Only Le Carre is pulling the strings, and he pulls them so very well. His skill is undiminished,
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game and I wish I had more  games like it great great weapons great bloodshed mages need better spells
B00DJXSKWU|4.0|I got this game for my kindle fire and I have to play it with the kindle laying flat or the game is upside down. Its a fun game I do wish that you could control multiple troops at a time and move them further than the edge of the screen maybe in a later version.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I really loved this movie because Katy Perry opened up to us and let us get a view of her work and personal life. The movie also shows how shes not an overnight success. Also, explains how growing up with her family impacted the way she is today. Last but not least it shows how dedicated she is with her music. She is a great song writer and all her songs come from her life experiences. I really recommend this movie, its very inspiring ! :D I LOVE YOU KATY PERRY &#60;3
B00178JDCK|1.0|This pedal along with the echo machine, digital reverb/delay, and compressor/sustainer pedals by Behringer all worked great for the first two day I had them. The second night while using them they all one by one started malfunctioning. They would cut on and off and produce unpleasant sounds. I replaced the batteries thinking although the batteries should last longer than two days perhaps that was the issue (which it was not). I realized I got what I paid for, cheap poor quality pedals. I almost gave these products 2 starts b/c while they were working they sounded fantastic, how ever there is no point in guitar pedals that can't maintain working order after such short time. I didn't handle these pedals roughly nor expose them to any harsh environments that could warrant defective behavior. Simply had them on my carpet floor in front of my amp. These pedals were practically undistinguishable in sound from the higher end pedals they are based on and it was truly a tease to have thought I found a cheaper alternative to them. I will NEVER purchase any products from Behringer after this experience.
B00COCY67A|5.0|I enjoyed the music as always the photos and the music outtakes that are new to people as they were never released before so if you like Elvis buy the cd
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Good book. I had to keep putting it down and sometimes wished it was shorter so I could find out who the killer was.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I love the entire triology!  Jeffrey Archer's writing is seamless and very entertaining.  In the past I have read several of his other books.
B00AQM7T74|5.0|This is just the best movie ever!  It is laugh out loud funny and just never gets old or tired! Its a must have!
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Does not work on iPhone.  Very frustrated and not happy because of this.  iPhone is a large segment why not come up with one for it.
B00F91H666|1.0|Well, as far as I am concerned this movie is worse than one star.  Ok, I will blame myself for not reading up on this stupid movie before I rented it because I absolutely hate zombie movies of any kind!  But..I didn't anticipate the two main actors involved lowering themselves to a zombie movie either.  Let me say this, I rented the 128 minute version.  It took me 3 days to get thru 46 minutes of the 128 minutes!!  I just kept saying, &#34;OMG! This is so horrible!&#34;, and then turned it off!  Even the parts I forced myself to watch had such poor lighting that it seems like they filmed this in the dark our something.  Maybe they couldn't afford lights, I don't know.  But Brad Pitts last name has taken on a new meaning now.  It falls under movie ratings now...&#34;The Pitts&#34;. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan anyway but give me a break!  Even if I were I would hate this movie.  Like I said I didn't watch it all the way thru because it was literally that bad. I just want to pretend that the main characters were devoured by the zombies and therefore, I will live happily ever after!!!  Please don't tell me otherwise.  It's my fantasy.  Don't bother renting this unless you are a die hard zombie fan because that is all this is about.  I have to stop typing now.  I'm having WWZ flashbacks.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|As a long time PSB fan, I have to say this is a great album. It's got a more dance/mix sound, much like Introspective. All of the tracks are good, but my favorite in &#34;Vocal&#34;. For you PSB fans, it's a must get!
