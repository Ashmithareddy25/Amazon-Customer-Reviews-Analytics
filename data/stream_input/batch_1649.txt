030758836X|5.0|This book is one of the better ones I've read this year.  It is hard to review without giving away any spoilers.  Just do yourself a favor and get this book. It takes mind games to the next level and will make you rethink all of your relationships.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Thank you to all involved - a fine film. Beautiful story about an unlikely friendship - seriously heart warming. Don't delay - see it - you won't regret it. I wish I could say that more often. I  watch a lot movies these days and I'm frequently disappointed. And, that's why I rarely write movie reviews...

1596680199|4.0|This book is all about technique of creating polymer clay BEADS. Very easy to understand, plus picturial tutorials. It will be a great reference for beginner to learn the basic techniques and for intermediate or advance polymer artist to take the step further.<br /><br />My only small critic is some of the finishing beads are quite simple, i think carol can do better than that with years of experience but other than that, its all worth the money in the technical aspect.<br /><br />This book will be your \\"polymer bible\\" as long as you are polymer claying. Definitely a keeper. Do keep in mind that this is a technique book in creating polymer beads not a book in creating creative jewelry.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This movie has everything. It is a beautiful love story, it has a message, Never give up on your dreams and of course the shining star of this movie is the music. It is uplifting and entertaining. This is a excellent family movie that can be watched and enjoyed by everyone. I often give this movie as a gift and everyone who sees it loves it.
1476715904|5.0|I ordered this on my kindle but waited a while before I started to read it. Last night I started it and forced myself to stop reading at 2:45 AM and had gotten to 74%! This a great story, full of emotion! I can't wait to finish it!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|When I heard that two Snow White movies were being released in one year my first thought was, \\"Why?\\" How many different ways can you tell this story without it being stale? What does the tale of Snow White, a domestic goddess, waiting patiently for her prince to come, while being a homemaker to seven little people, say to the 21st century girl, or woman, that's worth saying twice?<br /><br />Rupert Sanders and his team of writers did an admirable job of proving that the tale can be told on a much grander scale as an allegory about good and evil. Snow White is not just a pure and charming princess who's waiting for her prince to come and rescue her. Forces in nature guide her to a means for escape, but she has to have the heart and gumption to use it. She is a Savior, with a capital \\"S.\\" Her wicked stepmother, Queen Ravenna, is a demon and a plague that must be eliminated; although, she's just as much a victim of darker forces in the world as the inhabitants of the kingdom she usurped through a military coup and distinictly feminine trickery. This story is an epic tale of a heroine off to battle.<br /><br />The cinematography is gorgeous and it seems that the director's intent is to remind you that despite the fact that he set this story in a dark and sinister, reality-based world, it's still a fantasy. His allusions to Princess Mononoke, Lord of the Rings, and even Star Wars (Ewok-style) is appreciated and places the audience firmly back in the right state of mind when the situations in which Snow White finds herself become downright depressing.<br /><br />Then there is Kristen Stewart, who gets an entirely undeserved bad rap for her acting. She is brilliant, beautiful, and entirely believable as the embattled Snow White who just wants to get what's rightfully hers. She doesn't want to do it simply because she wants the power. During her journey, she and the audience gets to see emaciated inhabitants of a kingdom that flourished under her father's rule; dwarves whohave lost their magic and been reduced to eight in numbers and living a shameful life; women with scarred faces to escape Ravenna's vampiric desire for beauty; and men gone and at war with an evil so powerful that their fight is an exercise in futility. Snow White is their only hope and she gives them her word that she can win the war. She'd rather die than to continue seeing people live in a dead world.<br /><br />The religious symbolism is strong throughout - three drops of blood, possibly symbolic of the blood of Christ. Snow White comes onto the scene with a prayer and dolls of her father and mother held tightly to her chest - The Father and The Virgin Mary, perhaps. I think this movie was well-done with a few editing and pacing problems.<br /><br />Charlize Theron's slightly over-the-top antics as the deranged queen is counterbalanced perfectly with Kristen's understated and consistent performance of determination and resolution to end her reign. They compliment each other well. Charlize's intimidating, deranged queen is exactly what is needed to convince the audience of the urgency of Snow White's journey to defeat her. The Prince, William, played by Sam Claflin is underutilized, but very effective, and his intentions surprisingly ambiguous in his small part. Chris Hemsworth's performance is heart-breaking, humorous, and soulful. Eight of some of the best English film and stage actors play the dwarves, from Bob Hoskins to Johnny Harris. They are funny, a little dark and twisted, and very necessary.<br /><br />This movie ends smartly. Everybody knows that good will win. They didn't change the core of the canon story. However, some things are left uncertain and the weight of the reality of ruling a kingdom entirely alone after being imprisoned for ten years dances across her face. Once again, great acting from Kristen who in the end gives us a small smile. I won't say why. If not for the editing and pacing, I would give this movie five stars.
B005LLSNNE|3.0|Sons of Anarchy is an amazing series! Cheap and easily accessed via Amazon.com. Unfortunately, streaming was a little shaky. Sounds and video rarely lined up. Could put up with it because of the price, but not as good as streaming at Netflix.com.
B00533CLE2|4.0|I have been a big fan of Derek Trucks, but had never paid too much attention to Tedeschi.... but now I am. I really like this album, compared to most people who have reviewed this album, I heard this album very late. But I am glad I did.  Deff a recommendation to any body who likes good music, blues music, rock music, and music in general. Midnight in Harlem, Bound for glory, Until you remember, learn how to love you are some of the gems of this album. Give it a listen.

B005OCHOZS|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It is the story of how a boy grew into a great ultramarathon star and gave quite a bit of insight into the psyche required for that sport. He talks a lot about trascendence and the importance of living in the moment, about how he has always searched for the feeling of nothingness. About half way through the book I started thinking, 'why doesn't he just go get high if he wants to get lost in the moment so badly'? Right after I wondered this he started talking about how ultramarathon running attracts recovering addicts, so I guess there is a connection.<br /><br />Being a casual jogger and a mostly-vegan I appreciated the training tips and the recipes. I also though he did a nice job of encouraging the reader to get out and go for a run, participate in a race, volunteer for an event etc. without being patronizing. Although he is clearly an elite athlete I felt like he really believes that running is for everyone to engage in and enjoy.<br /><br />I only took a star off because after a while I started to get annoyed by all his talk of yearning and seaching for transcendence and I just wanted to shake him by the shoulders and tell him to get a grip. Everyone has tough aspects of their lives and you just need to find a way to deal with them while getting on with life. I started to wonder if running was actually fueling his obsession, but he ends up thinking that running and eating healthy food is what has helped him to find inner peace. Oh well, more power to him, I hope he finds what he's looking for.

B004LUS390|5.0|Sketchbook Mobile<br /><br />SketchBook Mobile , is an app from the app store. This is an art app, and one of the best ones too! It includes the usage of layers, and has many other little tools to make your art stand out! I especially love that it's great for all art, big and small!<br /><br />I was looking for a suitable art app I could use for my iPad, and iMac computer. And this was recommended to me! It works great, and it is easy to use. But, it also has a sophisticated format.<br /><br />You can do a lot of things with this little app! It also makes my art look Amazing! I learned a lot from this app as well. For instance, I learned how to use layers, which saved me from Art Disaster! I truly believe this has made me a better artist than I was before.<br /><br />Just to forewarn you, this is an app for people who LOVE art! This isn't just a little doodle app either, this is a project app. DO NOT get this app if you dislike drawing. Also, you may want to learn how to use layers BEFORE getting this, I learned the basics from YouTube, but there are other ways as well.<br /><br />The only complaint I have for this app is, you need to SAVE your work before you quit completely out of it. This does not save automatically.<br />But in the end, I love this app dearly, and can't imagine living, or continue, with my art without it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app!Now I can make book covers for me and my friends and plus I can pictures for my friends that are on twitter and I can send it to them very easily!This app is so much fun and I can never get enough of it!
0486295559|4.0|My first impression of Persuasion was that Jane Austen writes some interesting and detailed characters. Right from page one, Sir Walter was my favorite character. He's a jerk, yeah, but he's hilarious. I don't know that the characters in this book are as modern as they are in say Pride and Prejudice, but the author's brutal honesty, especially about the less appealing characters, is always entertaining. The whole story made me really think about how much other people influence our lives and whether or not that is always a good thing.<br /><br />And can Jane Austen write a romance. The flirting, the dashing hero that you want but can't have, and that beautiful love letter! I do have to say that there was one major climactic scene that just felt cheesy to me. Oh the horror! Other than that, it was refreshing and fun to read a Jane Austen novel that I didn't even know existed until a few years ago.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I enjoy pinterest on my computer it is also nice to have it on my Kindle Fire as well.  This way I can see my bulletins and share and find new fun stuff wherever I am.  Pretty good job folks! The views are clear and works well.
B002PJN59M|5.0|I thought it was interesting that the first 2 nights filming on this movie turned out too dark and worthless!  The cinematographer was fired and Alex Thompson, BSC took over and photographed the rest of the film.  He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography for Excaliber that year.  This is a great, but very dark telling of the legend of King Arthur with great performances and beautiful cinematography.  Camelot the musical this is not!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|iT WAS AN EASY READ.. GAVE AWAY MO SECRECTS.. wHAT BRAVE MEN!! iT WAS A NON BIASED ACCOUNT OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.
B00371V6SE|3.0|I thought it was heartfelt and captivating story. It had a very nice start and the anticipation feeling to it. At first it was hard to tell who is going to be main character, of those two.<br />I really loved reading about his relationship with his dog. I thought it was beautiful. Actually, that relationship and the bond between him and the animal was more believable than between him and her. But it's only my opinion. I did like the scenes where they interacted, but I wished that the chemistry an her part would have been stronger. There was no doubt about his feeling towards her, but her character fell a little flat, in my opinion.<br />But I absolutely loved her grandmom. She was nice contribution to the story.<br />The thing that I was missing was the drama. There were quite a few scenes where I felt like they should have been more dramatic. The things that the characters were experiencing didn't feel as emotional as they should have felt. I felt like the dog and the guy had more chemistry than the hero and heroine. I did feel the buildup, but often, when it reached the top, scene it self fell flat.<br />I did like the way story ended.<br />I also want to say that the movie didn't do the book justice. But then again, movies based on books rarely does.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I love this lady. I think I have every CD she has ever made. I also had the cassettes..ha ha. I'm a big fan of Ms Raitt.<br />This is some remakes of some old tunes that I loved before but I like her spin on them.
B000JMKRKC|3.0|3.5stars  actually<br /><br />The synopsis is accurate enough to not require a re-hash or clarification.  What kept me going was the insane love affair that Ms. Setterfield described in the most loving and intimate manner.  As every reader knows it is the insane love of books!<br /><br />Bookshop clerk & amateur biographer Margaret Lea's very quiet life takes a turn when she's been invited to pen the biography for one of the most prolific and notorious contemporary writers.  While Margaret is deciding if she will take on this daunting assignment she fills the time by uncovering a family secret and learning more about the reclusive Vida Winter and her writing - most notably the never published thirteenth tale.  Ms. Winter who has spent a life charming the media while dangling her life's secrets and her personal history as a treat to journalists has now offered this tidbit to Margaret. Spinning rich tales worthy of Scheherazade to explain her life, Ms Winter the enigma allows a peek to her true self. As the two danced around sisterhood, friendship and the telling of secrets I found myself both interested and bored. The literary setting with the Victorian air is perfect for this read and the characters were fine.<br /><br />With so much to interest & please me I was disappointed to only be able to give this read 3.5stars.  There is such a thing as teasing too much and/or wanting too long.  I felt that here.  The information I needed was dropped too slowly and the descriptions went on a bit too much to ensure my enjoyment (I am more than fine with less than 3examples - honestly. I get it). While the beginning was held together with charm the unexpected ending was definitely the payoff for patience.
B000CDO330|4.0|The giraffe is strudy, well painted and tough. I like it alot. It is not easily broken. I would recommend it to a friend.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|4.75Stars -Sometimes Life is Hard<br /><br />This book was recommended & gifted to me \\"for it's great poetry\\" and immediately shelved. I thought \\"Ugh, poetry?  really?\\"  Then I promised to read it. Well no, it really wasn't primarily poetry. Yay I promised to read it. In modern lyrical vernacular this tome is appropriately titled - it is the epitome of raw emotion. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with these characters.<br /><br />I could not put this down once I began reading it - I was utterly caught up in what would happen next for these characters and wanted to know how things would end.  This extremely quick read is a love story and takes you through every emotion possibly like no other. I found myself smiling at thefoilbles of the fully fleshed characters. I also found myself saddened when life kicked them a little too hard in the teeth.  Not to be outdone there were tears of joy and sadness because they felt so right in the moment.  I didn't register a false step in the flow of the storyline.<br /><br />Layken and Will led an all star cast but the supporting characters almost deserve equal billing.  Surprisingly, I immediately connected with every single character as they were introduced.  As Lake and Will meet and quickly progress to deep feelings for each other life keeps rolling along and their road is both smooth and strewn with obstacles. The plot and storyline are so tightly woven and so accessible that as a reader you would be hard pressed to not recognize personal life moments.  That is not to say there aren't the angst-y moments present in the earlier chapters, but there is maturity in the majority of the book as characters stretch and grow.<br /><br />This is a gem to lose sleep over.  Brava Ms. Hoover - well done!
1611761565|5.0|An incredible inside look at the personal side of these dedicated american patriots.<br />Not just doing a job, but selflessly dedicating their entire existences to doing whatever is necessary to keep america safer. Most of us know the tales of the excruciating physical training these select few have to go through to become a member of this elite force. This book goes one-step further and shows you the complex psychological makeup and methodical drive that places these elite warriors in a class of their own. A must read for people who want to know more than just the newspaper headlines. Well written, to the point and well worth the read. In my opinion the author neither jeopardized national security nor betrayed his comrades. He simply told a story that needed to be told from an insider's viewpoint, in order to set the record straight, as well as to remind the public that this most important historical event, in modern times, was performed without political motives by Americans whose sole purpose on earth is dedicating their lives, 24/7/365 to being the Minutemen of the 21st century.[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]

Even though I only looked at it a few times it is really is a hands on book.  Full of diagrams and instructions for different scenarios this book covers everything.  For instance has colored pictures of toxic plants versus non-toxic plants and how to classify them.  I don't regret getting this book.  It even covers some urban scenarios.

0316236535|5.0|This is a wonderful book that has entertained and amused children for years and years and to some extent helped them with their fears and bad dreams. Once children are three and over, though, they can be empowered to understand bad dreams with monsters as stories they tell themselves in response to upsetting events from the previous day.  In [[ASIN:0983866406 Mommy, Daddy, I Had a Bad Dream!]] Joey, a bouncy kangaroo has bad dreams which his parents help him to understand until by the last one he can figure it out and go back to sleep without waking his parents.  Once children begin to think of their bad dreams as puzzles they can solve, they are no longer at the mercy of bad dreams and the monsters do not have to be shooed away!
B002UTKSBK|5.0|The cd that I originally bought got a scratch on it.  I was very disappoointed.  I immedidiately purchased the download from Amazon.  I listen to this cd almost on a daily basis, particularly if I am studying.  The music is fantastic in itself, but for me, it makes studying less stressful, time goes by more quickly, and it can be even a little more fun!  Great music!  Howard Shore did an incredible job!  Not sure what will come with the Hobbit.  Not sure HS can surpass FotR soundtrack, but we will see!  I enjoy the rest of the LotR soundtrack, FotR is my favorite.  I would recommend this to anyone!

I was going to give the movie 4 stars (and not five) because Kristen Stewart did another EMO, lip-biting, damsel in distress role that we have all seen (and many do not love). What is the fixation with her? Prettier than Charlize Theron?  Really? That was my only complaint with the movie and that is not Amazon's fault - Amanda Seiyfreid would have been much better in the role, except for the fact that she just did the OTHER similar movie. Oh well...back to the review.<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon, for this service! GREAT job. Oh, I use a ROKU device and love it, my iPhone with an app is the remote and it is flawless. Love this system.

I'll just say it has to do with the way some conflicts are resolved and that there's not enough Hit-Girl. It's also pretty short, and I guess could've had more story to it. Otherwise, like I said, if you really liked the first Kick-Ass, this one is worth a look.

B003QSS2VW|4.0|My family and I really enjoy watching these older Disney movies for our weekly \\"Family Movie Night.\\" We rented this through Prime, and the streaming quality was very good. Our only wish is for more of these older Disney movies to be made available.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It's so much better than flipping through a magazine. There are so many great ideas. Too bad there's not enough time to do everything that pinterests me.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book grabs you from the first page.  It's a \\"can't put it down\\" book!  It's about a lawyer whose young son is accused of murdering a classmate.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|While the writing is somewhat sophomoric and often repetitive this book provides interesting insight to the training and personal dedication of our Navy SEALS.  It also provides the skinny on the operation that brought down UBL, details we would never learn from our government leadership.
1451662432|1.0|Change Arnold's \\"I'm not perfect\\" refrain to \\"I'm extremely flawed\\" and this book might make an interesting psychological study, but it won't make it an interesting read.  This is Arnold's story about his insatiable desire for fame, sex and attention...blah blah blah.  It's Hollywood commercialized junk in print.  This guy has some ego, and that's the story.  Enough, already.  His sanctimonious confessions are as salacious as the next politician's, but the only real story here is the historical development of Arnold's ego.  Yawn.

0525953728|4.0|The book captivated me from the start.  I was pleased with how easy it was to read and finished it rather quickly.  Story was good though I am still not quite sure as to how there was/is so much controversy.  Everyone knows SEAL training is tough.  To me there was nothing ground breaking or earth shattering about the story told.

0765322889|5.0|I'll preface this by saying I've read the entire series.  I stuck through the whole thing right until the conclusion.  What did I find?  I found an incredible world unparalleled in scope.  I found characters who lived and breathed.  I found emotion that few books are able to evoke.  I also found confusion.<br /><br />I'll start off with the bad.  This entire series is convoluted and nigh impossible to understand in one go.  Nothing is explained in this series.  Everything just is.  I read 10 books of this stuff and I still could not even truly begin to explain to you how the magic system works, and I promise you the magic system is very prevalent in the series.<br /><br />Then you have plotlines.  I lack the words to describe how horrid the structure of this novel is.  If you think of a normal epic as having many plotlines which weave together to form a beautiful tapestry, you'll best understand the Malazan series as a tangled mess with no shape and some of the strings strewn about on the side.  Things happen and they don't make sense.  The ending of the series is beautiful but at the same time is nothing.  A character we haven't heard from in two books does something across the world with no foreshadowing whatsoever and it has a major effect on the end of the story.  This doesn't make sense and it's a bit disappointing.<br /><br />That said, the good.  The story is good.  It may be a tangled mess, but it is one beautiful tangled mess.  Once you finally find your feet you will enjoy where the story takes you.  I think this is mainly due to the characters.  Some of them are hit and miss, but when Erikson hits, it's a home run.  I truly cared about many of the characters and reading about them was a blast.  Some of them are misses, but this is rare.<br /><br />This is a series you'll truly have to work for.  If you want casual reading then stay away.  Don't buy this book because you'll hate it.  You have to really want this series to be good and you have to put in theeffort.  I do not mean reading 100-200 pages, I mean reading 1000 pages before things start jumping out.  I thought the entire series was pretty mediocre or even bad until I got to the third book, easily 1500 pages into the series.  If you're willing to strive to be enveloped in the world, I'd be hard-pressed to find a better fantasy series and I've read quite a few.  There is a masterpiece here if you can find it.
B0013AZLP0|4.0|If you like movie soundtracks and / or classical music you will enjoy this stirring theme.  Its interesting to hear the music on it's own, then you realize how crucial it is to maintaining the tone of the film.

0143119680|5.0|A Discovery of Witches by: Deborah Harkness is an amazing book.  It kept my interest from the beginning to the end.  There was a part that involved DNA and history of the US and other countries that was hard to get through, but it is important for the second book.  When I finished this book I was ready for the next one.  Deborah is amazing author.  This series kept my interest as much if not more than the Harry Potter series.

1849514003|5.0|This book is great! It comes with a ton of great examples and covers a very great breadth of how to use Cocos2d. I use this book more as a reference book than the other one \\"Learning Cocos2D: A Hands-On Guide to Building iOS Games with Cocos2D, Box2D, and Chipmunk\\", which takes you through a great app to make, but is also more rigid in terms of being able to do what i need to do.    Note: at first I tried the download the sample code from [...]  but the website was down at the time and so i ended up emailing the writer with a copy of my receipt to request the code. Not only did he give me the code, but he also gave me an extra chapter of reading material, and gave other helpful tips too. AWESOME writer + content. If for some reason packtpub.com is down, just email the author directly. it'll save you a lot of frustration.

0316228532|3.0|When you've written a multi-million dollar book series that has spawned movies, merchandise up the wazoo, and miraculously magnetized boys back into the reading fold, as J.K. Rowling did with the Harry Potter books, much is expected. Loyal fans want to love the next book you write; snobby critics look forward to skewering it--\\"She can write children's novels, but...\\"<br /><br />THE CASUAL VACANCY, however, is not as dramatic a departure as one would think. At the soul of the HP books is a love for the underdog. The least advantaged (Harry, Dobby, the Weasleys) are the noble souls, the wealthy aristocrats (the Malfoys and their kin) petty and corrupt. Rowling's Pagford Village is as much a character as any of the people living in its privileged enclave, as is \\"The Fields,\\" where lives darkness and desolation on the edge of town.  Other than the recently deceased Barry Fairbrother (the name proof positive that this vacancy doesn't fall too far from the Rowling oeuvre--she loves giving characters names that fit their attributes), A CASUAL VACANCY's characters are unpleasant in ways large and small.  At best, the Pagford denizens are uncaring, and at worst, they are uncaring--and to Ms. Rowling, there is no greater sin.<br /><br />Rowling is an avowed admirer of Jane Austen's writing and has constructed the equivalent of a small British village for her \\"little bit of ivory.\\" Unlike Austen, she includes a close-up view of the seamy side of life. Rowling is, to put it mildly, not the wordsmith Austen is, but she does have her gift for creating characters who are both distinctive and universal. Pagford is filled with characters we all know: dissatisfied wives who mourn their lost youth and drink too much; fat old lechers who see themselves as avuncular; single men who fear commitment and confrontation in equal doses.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple. Plays for power arise when Barry Fairbrother dies, leaving an open seat on the village council. If only a true Pagfordian can get the seat (as opposed to a bleeding heart liberal), the village will finally be able to unmoor \\"The Fields\\" from its borders.<br /><br />There is not a single living character who is basically decent, though Rowling suggests that the denizens of The Fields want to be better than they are, unlike their more privileged counterparts. This presents a conundrum--if privilege spoils humanity, won't the decency of the underprivileged be altered if they are given the same opportunities?<br /><br />The grim scenes culminate in a climax that proves just how dangerous the lack of basic caring can be. Rowling's political philosophy is more naked in this book than in the HP series, and while it didn't stop me from reading it, I felt that nuances and characters were sacrificed in order to deliver a too-clear message. There's a thin line between fiction and propaganda and I am afraid THE CASUAL VACANCY is diminished by too much black and white and not enough subtle gray.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|this game says its on the kindle tablet, but it says 'Sorry, this app is currently unavailable for your device. Please try again later.' It looks like a good game and i wish it will come for the Fire. p.s. i have an HD<br /><br />---UPDATE---<br /><br />A week later it comes out. I got it and it is very fun. One update had a glitch. When you went to the shop and tried to see your warrior, it showed a mob of beige and white. The next update fixed it, thankfully.

Not only are the references easy triggers to a ton of memories, the pace and style of the book reminds you of the very games and adventures it describes.  Weeks later, I am still thinking back to how much fun this was and wishing there was more where it came from.  Well worth the read.

1451662432|1.0|Why this book and why at this time ? The author was one of the worst Governors in the history of California--and I say this as a conservative . The publication of this tripe now establishes that he is even a worse human being . The revelation that he did not let Maria Shriver review the book before publication tells you all you need to know about the Governor. Better to take the $20 and donate to Ms Shriver's charity . Ahnold---good riddance sir.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Its great when the final book in a trilogy is just as good, no better, than the first book.  Loved it.  Couldn't get enough

B0036BK6MW|4.0|Very well done.  When my 25-year-old daughter suggested it, I thought I was going to have to sit through a chick flick.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Many great laugh-out-loud lines.  Engaging characters, good acting.  This movie would appeal to everyone in the family.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is amazing!! I couldn't put it down! After I finished it I was ready for more! The entire series is a must read!
0439023513|5.0|Be warned, this is heavy subject matter.  I became interested in the series when my 10 year old son said he wanted to read Hunger Games because his friends were reading it.  My wife and I bought it for him not really thinking about it because he likes to read and we're thrilled with that.  Then the movie came out (luckily we bought the book within a short period of the movie release).  After seeing the movie I confiscated the book, which my son had only gotten a few chapters in, thank god, and I decided to read it.  The movie is close to the book, but the situational violence is worse...  and the rest of the series is even darker. So, like I said, great trilogy story, but very dark.
B008XG1X18|3.0|it would be better on my kindle fire if I didn't have to force close it at least three times before it opened. but other than that works great for me.

B005LAJ212|5.0|the show keeps you wanting more, and what is going to happen next!!! it has a lot of unexpected twists and turns ,and keeps you enthralled and can wait till the  next epidsode to see what comes next, great show
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had so many twists and turns! I would think it was going one way and then there was a complete shift and then another complete shift after that. It was compelling, but creepy and left me feeling a bit disturbed that anyone could be so conniving and manipulative, cold and patiently calculating. Whew!
B007WV05GY|5.0|I saw the movie at the theater and liked it so much that I wanted the DVD.  Somehow I got the instant video version and couldn't watch it on my computer.  It is a movie that you can't miss.  I just wish that I can get a DVD so I can watch it as many times as I like on my blue ray player.  Excellent movie.  Very intense.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. Yes, Marilyn Monroe bios have been \\"done to death,\\" that is true, but this was a different take on the actress, from another person's persepctive. This was a young man who actually only knew her briefly and spent one week of his life with her. However, the innocence of both this man and Marilyn were so touching and the moments they shared so tender, that I couldn't help falling in love with her story all over again. Michelle Williams was brilliant, capturing the mannerisms and dialect of Marilyn so well, I forgot at times that it wasn't actually Marilyn. The plot is basically a snapshot of a moment in the late movie star's life, when she was filming The Prince and The Showgirl with Olivier in England. The relationship between Marilyn and her then newlywed husband, the late playwright, Arthur Miller, was only touched on, as it wasn't the focal point. As far as Sir Laurence, her strained relationship with the late great English actor and director was highlighted, as was his philandering and troubled marriage to the late Vivien Leigh. Marilyn's obvious emotional problems and insecurities give the viewer a sense of foreboding as to further troubles to come toward the end of her life.  All in all, it was a well made film worth seeing, and I enjoyed the trip back in time.

B0091REZMW|3.0|meh the best thing is the price is fairly additve and can be fun . but needs more<br />s<br />tory to it
B000002WPH|2.0|They definitely should have made this 2 vinyls. The maximum length for a 12 inch should usually be 26 min. but Enter the Wu-tang is nearly 62 minutes long. When they pressed it all to one vinyl it ruined the signal to noise ratio and now it's too quiet and pops are the loudest thing on the record. It really is a shame because this album is classic but I guess I can't complain since I only paid $12.

B00004VVND|5.0|I recently pulled out my copy of this movie for a re-watch and was reminded all over again how well some movies age. This is one of those. While it is a Michael Crichton story, and most books don't do well being transitioned to film, this one did. Pared down, yet maintaining the tension and smoothing out the edges too much dialogue would create, this is one of the best transitions I've seen.<br /><br />Westworld, Roman World and Medieval World make up the segments of a new type of grown up Disneyland called Delos. The story revolves around what happens in Delos when a glitch (modern day folks will recognize it as a computer virus) wreaks havoc on this machine driven utopia for humans. Our two main characters, wonderfully portrayed by James Brolin and Richard Benjamin, have chosen to visit Westworld for a good old fashioned gun-slinging adventure. One of them is fully immersed while the other still feels rather odd shooting people or having random sex even if they are robots. They look and act human within the context of their programming. They get a whole lot more gunslinging than they bargained for during this very bad vacation.<br /><br />Yul Brynner, our main foe, is not singing about Siam in this movie either...he's a robot gunslinger and a bad dude. And he is also infected with the virus that makes them react aggressively against the humans who blissfully vacation there. He is stunning in this movie. For a robot that displays no emotion he does an excellent job of using microexpressions and posture to create a fully realized menacing enemy that never tires or sleeps.<br /><br />The virus or glitch that ruins Delos isn't limited to West World and though the movie doesn't focus on it too extensively, the mayhem in Roman World and Medieval World is just as horrifying and the results very deadly. There are secondary characters that we intermittently follow in those other worlds that allow the watcher to see what happens, if briefly.<br /><br />Now, I love a movie with a morality tale behind it and this one is chock full of them. It's also quite prescient in many respects. Today, almost 40 years after it was made, we are nearly immune to the pain of others. We are entertained by reality TV where people are in danger or deprived. We watch stand-offs on TV, eyes peeled for the shoot out or dramatic suicide (as just happened the other day on FOX). We watch endless replays of bombings and grainy footage of horrific happenings (like the man who ate the person's face recently). We are entertained by the horrible and increasingly seek more extreme methods of getting an adrenaline rush. At least a lot of us are.<br /><br />In this future we've taken it to the ultimate level. Robots programmed well and realistic in looks are there for any fantasy. Roman orgy, medieval crusade or western shootout, it's all there for the taking. No more virtual killing in video games, this one the paying public gets to really act out but in perfect safety. That is, until a virus hits that makes the poor robots decide getting their faces blown off isn't so fun and they best fight back. Classic technology coming to bite you back tale. You gotta love that.<br /><br />Yes, I'll admit there are some 1970s-isms in there in terms of fashion, styles and behavioral norms you'll have to look over. Some of the tech is hilarious when compared with today. My microwave has more complicated boards in it! But still, its a fun romp with a good tale to tell and I highly recommend it for those who like classic sci-fi, dystopian movies, near future movies and just plain 1970s movies.ith a morality tale behind it and this one is chock full of them.

B0083SBJXS|4.0|Excellent, excellent movie.  Hold on, let me think of another word to describe it..... extremely well-done!!  Well, that's three words.  Nonetheless, for any Marvel fan, action movie-goer, or for those who have yet to see it, you will not be dissappointed.  I can be a tough critic at times, and granted this movie had if any one flaw.  And that is only that I wish Hulk could have been played by Ed Norton rather than Mark Ruffalo.  His perfomance was good, but I've read that it was superb and was better than every hulk EVER.  Those of you are entitled to that opinion.  Other than that, the film blended perfectly action and humor, which at the outset - the weeks leading up to its release - I was worried about.  All of the individual films were so close together that I feared this film may have been rushed and would fall sub-par.  But I was incredibly shocked.  The performances were delightful.  Yet there were the serious moments that kept you pressed against your chair, wondering if this team of loose cannons could pull of the big job: protecting our planet.  But in the end, and sorry if you think this is a spoiler, they come together and do a damn good job.<br /><br />Why the four stars?  Eh, just wasn't a fan of Mark Ruffalo.  But I still give it 5 nonetheless.  Can't wait for the sequel!!!

B005LAJ17M|1.0|This show was very good until the writers decided to have Carrie's bi-polar disorder discovered by her CIA bosses. That revelation gets her kicked out of the agency at the end of season 1 yet somehow she's sent by those same CIA directors to the Middle East to get information from a woman on the agency's behalf at the start of season 2. Do the creators of this show really think the viewers are that stupid? Maybe some people overlook that plot killer, but this is being called one of the best show's on TV and the truth us it's not even close to that. She also had numerous classified documents in her possession at her home and she gets in no trouble at all? Need I go on? How this show beat out Breaking Bad, Mad Men, or Boardwalk Empire in ANY Emmy category is pathetic. I can't believe I gave season 2 a try last night, but when the CIA came to her home to recruit her (not as a CIA agent) to go back and get info for them about an imminent attack, that was it, I had to turn it off. If anyone deserved to be nominated for an Emmy it was Mandy Patinkin, but as good as he was in all of season 1 it would have just been a nomination since both Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito deserved to win for Breaking Bad (still the best show that's currently on TV). Hey writers, here's an idea...keep the disorder that once discovered kills the character's believability going forward for the show's finale (at least until the last few episodes). That's writing 101.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|Stewart did much better than I expected. I was expecting a Natalie-Portman-In-Star-Wars debacle (Natalie couldn't hold her prop gun convincingly; let alone act). But she brought the right amount of angst to the character to be convincing.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the show belonged to Charlize Theron.  To paraphrase one of her lines, she was the queen that wretched world deserved. Terribly beautiful, miserable and bitter, hate-filled and constantly scanning for the fairest one who could break her power.  I really enjoyed this interpretation of the queen.<br /><br />Over-all, pleasantly surprised!

Just gives you the experience of the missions leading up to and the mission that killed the number one most hated man in America!

1476712042|2.0|This book was recommended by Amazon along with really professionally written, moderately literate books such as \\"Light Between Oceans\\" and \\"Gone Girl\\".  (You know the part where they say \\"Customers who bought this item also bought...)  I used to use that as a guide to what I would purchase, but no more.<br /><br />I'm sure Debbie McGuire is a very nice person, and I admire anyone who can sit down and write 350+ pages.  However, this is really just an uninspired romance novel.  It is violent, boring, overly long.  Where was the Editor?  Several scenes lost continuity, such as Abby sitting in her dorm room, and the next paragraph Fitch is handing her a beer at the Valentine's party.  There are many typos and mispellings, and misuse of apostrophes.<br /><br />I read about 3 books a week, and this one really was just a total waste of time and money.

The note section is great for jotting down things you learn while reading the scripture, and you can share with others, so you can get different opinions and encouragements for daily life. This is the best Bible app yet!

0345803485|5.0|PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read Fifty Shades--it is the best romance that I have read in a long while. I really really enjoyed the book as well as the intense psychology tension that drives the plot. Great book, fast read, can't put it down. You should read it too.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The app works pretty good. sometimes slow to load and does freeze on occasion but otherwise...<br />What drives me nuts is the Icon in my favorites is just a gray box. What's up with that
0345803493|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and I encourage everybody to read it. It is deep, emotional, absorbing, everything that I am looking for in a romance. I have read many romance in the past, and Fifty shades trilogy is one of the best.
0345803485|2.0|These were interesting stories about a couple and their sex life.  It is written by a woman, oddly enough who is married and has children,  The book itself has a nice story to it but the characters are really oversexed and it seems to take over their lives.  I mean who has time to go to work?  They are filthy rich but that doesn't seem to change their swearing and weird sex habits.
B0000041WV|5.0|It's kind of a shame that people in general know so little about this great composer, but it seems, apparently, they don't.  Most people know of his Ninth Symphony, the \\"New World\\" Symphony, but how many have ever heard the others?  Not too many, I'm sorry to say, and I shouldn't boast because before a few years ago, neither had I.  It wasn't until I got hooked on a classical FM station back in New Jersey (Yes, I said New Jersey!) that I got to hear some of Dvorak's other works.  (I wish this set-up would let me put in the correct diacritical marks so I could spell his name properly, but it won't!  Drat!)  Once I heard them, I knew I had to get the set of his symphonies, so I did.  This set is a total delight and all nine are represented, which is the the beauty of this set.  If you do purchase it, I'm pretty sure that like me, you will love it.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Great movie!  Now that we've seen it, we are definitely adding it to our collection! Great action and the cast is amazing!
B0001BKAEY|5.0|\\"Matrix\\" is, was, and ever shall be a masterpiece of photographic magic, and this is no exception.  I refuse to go into detail lest I inadvertently ruin it for you.  Neo, Trinity, and the rest are nothing less that great, and the photographic effects must be seen to be believed.  I will say the bad guy gets his, in spades, but that's all I'll say about that.  Watch it, and you'll see what I mean, but above all, WATCH IT!!

B002RV01QI|5.0|I must confess, I knew very little of Enya's works, but I bought this CD, anyway, and am I glad I did!  This young lady has an exquisite voice, and the back-up music will blow you away.  The whole disk is a delight, even if she does one of the songs in Latin and a few in Gaelic.  Who cares about the words?  The music does it all, trust me!  I was just carried along on waves of delight until the last song.  That one just blew me away.  It was the cherry on the sundae, so to speak.  It is a chorale version of \\"Silent Night\\" in Gaelic, and is so hauntingly beautiful it will send chills down your spine.  If you don't have this disk, then do yourself a massive favor and buy it!  You will not be sorry, I guar-on-tee!
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|If you can appreciate the slower pacing of this movie you'll find a great lower budget zombie flick. I was very pleased to stumble upon it and will probably watch it again sometime soon.
B007SGM084|1.0|Very thin plot line, shallow characters.  Every 3rd page is pornographic sex and masochistic play.  Another example of media hype and bestseller lists telling us what we should be reading.  Would not recommend this book.
0345803493|1.0|i was curious about all the fuss surrounding this book so bought all three of the trilogy. i just managed to get through the first one and the other two were a struggle but i did finish them; probably because i wanted to find out what happened to the improbable characters. if i'm going to submerge myself in the imagination of a writer i prefer at the very least a tiny bit of believeability. i found none in these books. when i was only a short way into the first book i got the distinct impression that the book was aimed at female readers in their early teens. it seemed to be a romance novel with some supposedly \\"naughty\\" sex added. the sex scenes weren't the problem for me although they too seemed downright silly. i suspect that it's difficult to write a good sex scene but these are very unrealistic and i speak as someone who has had sex. not with a young godlike billionaire or a wide eyed stumbling twit though. maybe i've been missing out? the books caused me to bite my lower lip.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was not expecting Harry Potter but expected much better from Ms. Rowling. Are you sure she actually wrote this? This book is a complete boor and I am returning it immediately.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a decent version of solitaire. if it told you when there were no more moves, it would be better.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I have read alot of your stuff and this is the best.  I was clueless right up to the end.  That almost never happens (unless the plotting is bad and the ending a cheat)  I read this in 6 hours.  Don't go back to the blood and gore.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I really don`t leave comments for anything, but I have to leave one for this book. I couldn`t put this book down. It kept me wondering what would happen next. The flow of the book was great and the book was very easy to read. I think this book was by far one of the best books I have read. It was amazing.
B005LAIHE0|1.0|I may have laughed twice during this endless film.  It seemed way to long.  The movie really dragged on and on.  Was a very depressing comedy.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|If you haven't heard anything about \\" The Dark Knight Rises,\\" you've probably been living in a cave for the past few months. This amazing superhero thriller has been making box office records since its opening weekend. Although a tragic shooting was involved with this movie, it's a movie that's worth seeing.<br /><br /> The movie itself is very well done. Intriguing the viewer, the script does not bore you, and it's complemented by flawless acting. The special effects are done perfectly, with explosions that never bore the audience and plenty of good fights. Gotham, the fictional city in which the story takes place, has so much detail that you often forgot it doesn't exist.<br /><br /> This movie has very interesting characters: Bruce Wayne/Batman, Bane(the villain), Robin John Blake(Batman's sidekick), and Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Wayne, a billionaire socialite looking to protect Gotham, is an appealing character who never really says much, but is easy to understand. The villain of the story, Bane, has a brutal style of fighting that's only purpose is to cause the victim excruciating pain. He communicates with people in such a manner that makes it impossible to read his emotion, making him an even better antagonist. Batman's sidekick, Robin, wants nothing more than to protect Gotham and its orphaned boys, making him an excellent character that you grow to respect. And lastly, there's Selina Kyle, a cat burglar who steals jewels, who offers a character that isn't violent like the others and prefers to run away from dangerous situations, much like a cat would do. Throughout the film, she works her way into Wayne's trust and eventually wins his heart.<br /><br /> Overall, \\"The Dark Knight Rises,\\" a wonderful film with a good combination of action, romance, and suspense, will definitely keep you entertained. So be sure to stop by a movie theatre and check it out. You won't be disappointed!
1449415881|5.0|Every year I buy a new dilbert desktop calendar. Few years ago they were a little better: they had activities in the back and there were strips to saturday and to sunday, separated. But they still are a good piece of fun over my desk...
B0052AC8C6|3.0|The only reason I, a full blown adult, decided to watch this movie by myself was because it had Johnny Depp in it.  I was probably not the first person to do this and I will probably not be the last.<br /><br />I didn't really go in with any expectations, good or bad, and I found myself pretty entertained. But... I am an adult. I am not sure it is a great movie for kids.<br /><br />Even if you ignore the sexual references (because I don't think even most quasi-older kids will pick up on them) there is violence (guns, fist fights, yaddah yaddah..) However, the biggest thing for me is the dare-I-say-it SUICIDE attempt! I don't know how a child will react to this, I don't have kids, I am not extremely knowledgeable about kids, so I am not claiming to be an expert by any means. But it shocked me.<br /><br />I grew up watching Dumbo drinking alcohol and having weird hallucinations, looney tunes with dynamite and anvils, Bambi's mom getting shot, the lion king's Cain and Abel like murder of Mufasa..<br /><br />and I think I turned out just fine.. So maybe check it out first before letting your kids watch.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story line of Grey continues to pull me in and I can not wait to download the next series!!
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, I thought it followed along the graphic novel very well with some slight alterations.  I liked the revealing nature of an aging Batman as he struggles to perform feats he could easily do in his youth, but also revealing as he still struggles with and is still haunted by the death of Jason Todd/Robin.  Was not a big fan of the \\"new\\" Robin though, I think they could have done that role a little better.  If you're complaining because it didn't say \\"animated movie\\" somewhere in the title, the front and back covers should have been a clue that this was not the Batman movie you were looking for.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I heard Tattoo on a music video website and thought it was sonically awesome.  I love Dave, so his lyrics weren't a let down.  But, I just wanted to say that there is genius in Eddie's playing plus good poetry and story telling on this song.  And, Wolfgang is very good on the bass throughout the CD.  I think the people who were dissappointed with it were expecting something over produced.  This is their style and I'm happy they're back together.  I made comments on Youtube, but there was so much trolling, I stopped.  I bought the MP3 download of the CD here at Amazon.com for half the price.  I have no more expectations of these guys.  I wish them well and hope they go muti-platinum.  I also wish Michael Anthony good luck.  Saw a video interview of him.  He seems like a rich man who's enjoying retirement.  As for Sammy Hagar; well, this was never a competition to me, but I hope he realizes that Van Halen wasn't his band and that he never reunites with them.  I saw a video of him on their last tour and he acted really immature.
B003CH9PTU|3.0|Very annoyed when the show would just stop for as long as two minutes at a time. Also it did not appear to be in HD. I have  ordered through  Netflix for the 2nd season and beyond, and the problems are solved!
0439023513|3.0|I was disappointed in this book since it lacked the suspense of the first two. There are a few things I found hard to believe; one is that the leaders of 13 would give teens so much power, SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br />********<br />********<br /><br />the other is how Gale and Katniss grew apart. I just didn't buy it...<br />on the other hand how she ended up with Peeta was understandable. After all they'd been through together who else would be able to understand? But after what happened to Peeta, I found it unbelievable that Katniss would ever be able to trust him again.<br /><br />However, I found the book ended up conveying a feeling of hope, which I liked. The fact that Katniss and Peeta ended up having a family was the ultimate symbol of hope for a better future.<br /><br />I've read some reviews where some readers were upset the with the death of Prim at the end. I thought it was very authentic: no one is safe during war.<br /><br />Overall, I liked, but didn't love the series. Very imaginative way to present the dangers of an overly-powerful government.
B0011BDQ44|1.0|This is yet another throw-away episode.  This episode was made to \\"catch\\" new viewers up to the plot over the previous 5.5 seasons.  I'm a big Gate fan, and I can't stand clip shows... usually because I watch in marathons, and don't need to be reminded of the plot points.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I have a comic vlog on YouTube in which I discuss mostly each week's comic releases, but occasionally I throw in a subject video about this or that, and one that I felt that I was compelled to do was one about the year 1986, or as I call it, The Year That Changed Comics Forever. You had two major releases in the same year. One was Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' WATCHMEN, which for the first time, really introduced the deconstruction of the superhero to the comic book world, and holds the spot for the only comic book to be considered one of Time Magazine's Top 100 Novels of the 20th Century. The other was from a very popular writer/artist who had come from an extraordinary run on DAREDEVIL to DC Comics in 1985 with a strange and wonderful avant-garde fusion of a dystopian future blended with ancient Eastern mythology called RONIN. This still-young artist then, in 1986, decided to create a future vision of one of DC's most beloved and iconic characters that was brutal, dark, uncompromising and socially conscious. That man was Frank Miller, and that book that he created is one of the undisputed masterpieces in Comic Book history: BATMAN - THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS.<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS starts with a simple premise: It's the future, and it has been exactly ten years to the day that Gotham City and the world had their last sighting of Batman. And although it's not explicitly discussed, it is due to a few different things; the main reason being the implied death of a partner, and the other (and this is only an assumption) being that all of Batman's rogue's gallery as well as all elements of organized crime have either left Gotham, are behind bars or dead, or are in Arkham Asylum. So we have Bruce Wayne, a somewhat empty shell of a man trying his best to enjoy his retirement. We also have Commisioner Jim Gordon, facing his own mandatory retirement. The two are friends moreso than they ever were before because Gordon now knows that Bruce was Batman. This future is far from perfect though. The criminals of this era are products of a very new generation. They call themselves The Mutants, and they are not a gang of unruly kids; they are thrill-seeker killers that run around the city butchering children and nuns and anyone they want to show their depravity. Bruce, still a haunted man, and still very much an obsessive man, can no longer continue to ignore the threat they pose. And on a storm-toss'd night, suddenly The Batman reappears to wage his one-man war on crime.<br /><br />Now, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is far more than that description. It is epic in its scale of emotional storytelling arcs and the amount of characters it has; it's epic in its battles; it's epic because it needs to be. A return of Batman after a 10-year absence requires something of such a grand scale that a mere 70-odd minutes would not be enough to contain it. So the adaptation by Bob Goodman and the direction by Jay Oliva smartly divided this into two segments and this film is Part One, which covers the first two chapters (THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS; THE DARK KNIGHT TRIUMPHANT) of Miller's four-chapter tale. And sometime in 2013, we'll get Part Two. Unlike the previous Miller adaptation to be made by DC Animated, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, which was compact enough to be parsed into about 70 minutes of film, THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS is frankly too large for that.<br /><br />Now, many of the less-than-or-moderately-positive reviews of this film from people who are fans of the source material are upset because they feel the film waters down so many of the elements of the savagery and biting social commentary that made the book into what it is. And I can totally understand and appreciate that point of view. There was stuff in the film that wasn't in the book and vice versa. There were lines of dialogue from the book I desperately wanted to hear the gruff voice of Peter Weller, playing Bruce Wayne/Batman, say on screen. But for the most part, they kept a great deal of thebrutality in, like the scene with The Mayor and The Mutant Leader is the one that sticks out heaviest in my mind. There are moments of instantly recognizable panel composition from the book, including the immortal image of a silhouetted Batman brightly backlit by a lightning bolt. Much of the stylized street slang of the Mutants is present.<br /><br />But film, live-action or animated, is a much different animal than comics. Comics can offer so many different styles of narrative. Such as internal monologue that you can read into the mind of your characters, giving you insight, and while that's great on the page, it can really hurt your momentum in a film. Oliva ignores almost all of the internal monologue, except for a pretty glaring scene in which he decides to use it. That moment is very important, but because we are treated to the internal monologue there, the viewer who is familiar with the source material wants more, leading to the aforementioned disconnect. It really proves the old chestnut of how you can please some people some of the time, but you can't please everyone all the time.<br /><br />From a casting standpoint, Andrea Romano (who's been at this game for decades) assembles a list of great voice actors that are largely character actors that have appeared in some films and a lot of television. Weller is spot-on perfect. He has just enough of the world-weariness, but enough of the gravelly intonation that makes Batman a true bad@$$. David Selby, of shows like the original DARK SHADOWS and FALCON CREST, does an excellent job as the aging Gordon. Wade Williams, who has been in just about every television show from the 90's through today (and was even the Warden of Blackgate prison in Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT RISES) does a commendable job as the \\"rehabilitated\\" Harvey Dent. The real standouts here for me were young actress Ariel Winter as the voice of Carrie Kelley aka Robin and Michael McKean (THIS IS SPINAL TAP, and was even Perry White in TV's SMALLVILLE) as psychologist Bartholomew Wolper. Winter gives the youthful energy and strength that Carrie needs, and McKean gives the right air of pompous superiority as Wolper.<br /><br />The animation style doesn't totally ape that of Miller, but it certainly shows its influence with its heavy use of almost cube-like faces and enormous hulking bodies that give the characters that even-larger-than-life aesthetic. Occasionally, in particular with vehicle sequences, the movement gets bogged down by CGI, which can be really jarring. But the fight and action choreography is very fluid and the big fights are very brutal.<br /><br />DC Animated Films, under the auspices of mastermind Bruce Timm, have made quite a name for themselves since 1992, when BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES first premiered. That groundbreaking series made way for what is now considered the DC Animated Universe. They've recently been releasing a slew of nearly full-length animated films based on either some of the more famous characters or some extremely popular comic book story arcs, from characters like WONDER WOMAN and GREEN LANTERN: FIRST FLIGHT or GREEN LANTERN: EMERALD KNIGHTS (which are not from a specific story arc) to SUPERMAN/BATMAN: PUBLIC ENEMIES, JUSTICE LEAGUE DOOM, BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD, THE NEW FRONTIER, and SUPERMAN VS. THE ELITE. These have worked to varying degrees of success, but THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS PART ONE is one of the more successful attempts at bringing something to the screen that is something of an impossible undertaking. They know that there are legions of fans that consider DKR their \\"Batman Bible\\", and trying to please all of them by simply translating the book page-for-page would have been a disaster. You have to have enough surprising moments in the film that will keep the audience on its toes, or you might as well do a motion comic.<br /><br />My main complaint with this film is that I don't know how successful it will be as a storytelling experience unless you're familiar with the source material. I think that there's too much included that, just from a style standpoint, is really going to be confusing for fresh eyes to see it.

1597801585|4.0|THIS IS NOT A YOUNG ADULT BOOK. IF YOUR CHILD BRINGS THIS BOOK HOME, YOU SHOULD READ IT FIRST.<br /><br />Warning: This book contains graphic violence. In addition, there are graphic rape scenes that are performed in front of an audience as entertainment.<br /><br />\\"Don't look so worried. You have the same sickness. Life is, after all, inevitably fatal.\\"<br /><br />After a devastating world-wide event, food is controlled by three major corporations that modify plants to prevent fatal diseases as well as to make them impossible to grow from seeds outside of corporate control. The production of electricity has reverted back to man or animal powered methods. Japanese engineered humans called Windups were manufactured to live a life of servitude. And human life has little value as the survivors are forced to do whatever is necessary to survive. A fruit is discovered that was not grown by the corporations and one man tries to discover its source. At the same time, an immigrant looks to improve his situation by attempting to steal an improved technology from his employer. And a windup pleasure model desires to cast down her genetic shackles and escape the city to a community of new people. Part apocalyptic fiction, part science fiction and part mystery, this is an extremely dark and disturbing view of the future.<br /><br />The beginning was a little confusing at first as I felt it presupposed certain details. In fact, this novel is a continuation of the world set up in the short stories The Calorie Man and Yellow Card Man; I recommend reading those first, although it is not necessary to understand and enjoy this book.<br /><br />The Windup Girl is reminiscent of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick both in tone and theme. Bacigalupi's world resembles that of Dick's and the theme of whether or not artificial humanoids have souls is also a main topic in Windup. While Windup is similar in some aspects, the story is still unique and touches on many more political and societal issues that appear in Bacigalupi's world.<br /><br />The lack of value for human life is consistent throughout the story. This is a world where the death of one will likely ensure the life of another. Those who have the nerves required to set aside moral holdups and are willing to do anything that is necessary to survive will be more successful. And when death does occur, as it frequently does in this novel, it is quickly brushed aside as any other insignificant nuisance so work can continue. When someone dies, inevitably there is someone who is glad because it means their chance of survival just increased. This sense of disconnect and loss of empathy is truly terrifying.<br /><br />The topics are heavy; I do not consider The Windup Girl a light read. For example, it feels like the author is making social statements regarding corporate greed, social inequalities, ethnic tension and moral depravity. Whether or not it is intentional, it provides good material for discussion. Either way, it is an intriguing world and if you are a hardcore dystopian/apocalyptic fiction fan, you will likely enjoy this book.<br /><br />4 out of 5 stars.

B0095T3ES2|4.0|The premise of the movie and the actors were both strong -- what happens when two professionals have great opportunities in different parts of the country, and the man gives up his job for his fiancee's opportunity? But the plot turns became farcical as the man \\"bottomed out\\" during his three years of living in a small town for his fiancee, and became some sort of disturbed Unibomber-type character that made very little sense.  Nor did the ending make sense, when the couple decided to reunite and let their problems \\"work themselves out\\".  The cast did a great job, and the movie was entertaining and funny, which is why I'm going with 4 stars (I think 3.5 would be most accurate, actually).  But it was hard to buy into Jason Segel's character transformation in Michigan.  It was also a let-down to see the movie avoid any actual discussion of the real issues involved in balancing the career demands of a couple where both are professionals with highly demanding careers.  It's a pity that the movie avoided actually looking at the problems faced by the couple and went for the cheap laughs instead.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its one of the best best games I have ever played and I have played a lot of games including Chrono Trigger.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a very quick and easy read.  It did not present anything new about myself, but it helped me to understand more about who I am and that there is not a \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" character trait.  Yet, it is more about using who you are and your strengths to become successful.  I highly recommend this book - it is a great pairing with \\"[[ASIN:0974320625 Emotional Intelligence 2.0]]\\"
B004SBQGHS|5.0|A great game with ads is even better without them.  That's just sensible.  I mean who hasn't played Angry Birds at this point?  A long story shortened is that i had the free version a long time ago, lost all my data before i finished, and never reinstalled the game .  Now Angry Birds Ad-Free is the FAOTD and i couldn't resist.  I'll start over from the beginning and destroy all those naughty pigs and hopefully complete game this time.  If you haven't actually played this game, here's a quick summary.  You simply have to launch birds (your ammunition) of varying quantity, size, shape, and ability with a slingshot at pigs who sitting in/on structures.  The structures are made of different materials such as glass, stone, wood which all can me moved and/or destroyed.  You have to have the right trajectory, speed, and timing to destroy all the pigs in each level.  The fewer birds you use to eliminate all the pigs and the more objects you break, the more points you earn.  To advance to the next level, you have to receive at least one star.  Each level has a maximum of three stars that you can receive.  The graphics are nice and crisp and the sound quality is good too (there is a mute setting).  Controls are perfect, which they need to be in a game like this to ensure proper trajectory and speed of the bird.  Lastly, the game can be moved to the SD card if your phone has one, which is nice.  Once you play, you'll get hooked.  You'll be whistling the theme music without even realizing it.  HTC Thunderbolt stock rooted.

B0053O89Z6|2.0|This season really took the show from a comedy to a drama. I was a huge fan of HIMYM, however this last season left me feeling sad after nearly every episode. I rarely laughed, far different from the first few seasons that had me laughing out loud nearly the entire time.

0316228532|1.0|Truthfully, I want to forget this book. Where's Hermione when you need her?<br /><br />Like so many others who read this literary abortion, I feel very violated.<br /><br />The lack of plot, vulgar language, incoherent dialogue and unlikable characters made this one of the most uncomfortable reads of my life.<br /><br />It felt more like an obligation than it did anything else.<br /><br />Hopefully Rowling can redeem herself and prove to the world she isn't a one trick pony after all...<br /><br />Because at this point, that's what the world is feeling.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I loved reading this terribly written book. What a great escape when I wanted to distract my mind from the real world and read something I couldn't put down.  Its sexy, great story, didn't offend my feminist sensibilities too much, and was the perfect vacation book.  That said, some of the writing was laughable.  Where were the editors??  If she says one more time \\"he pressed his mouth into a hard line\\", I think I'll explode!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|it was great, met and exceeded expectations, would purchase again and again and again. best deal around, couldn't ask for more

0689878451|5.0|I saw this story on YouTube, where it was read in its entirety with the images on display. Now I'm going to buy this book and have it shipped to Iceland so I can read it to my five year-old sons. I'll have to translate it for them, as they don't know much English, but that won't be a problem.<br /><br />This story is super sweet and the images make it all the sweeter. I've never seen emotions drawn on animals as animatedly as they are here, making me go \\"awww\\" more than once. I'm glad the caretaker in the zoo was open minded about this couple and gave them an egg to care for (the bit about the little rock (and the images that went with it) was just too cute, but I was glad they got an actual egg). A must read for all children (and parents!).

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book left such a great impression on me that I felt compelled to write my first review ever on a novel.  It's hard to summarize the story without giving too much away - but in sum, this novel is about a young couple who are married and live in NYC.  They both lose their jobs and circumstances bring them to move to Missouri, the husband's (Nick) hometown.  When his Manhattanite wife (Amy) goes missing, what ensues is a stomach wrenching (in a good way), plot twisting rollercoaster of events that has you on edge and keeps you guessing and wanting more.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn is an incredible writer.  She really gets us into the minds of the main characters, and tells the female perspective AND male perspective extremely well.  You really felt she understood how men and women think and was able to convey it brilliantly in this novel.  The characters are morally twisted and there is a lot of foul language, but this book is a great read for anyone who likes a good mystery novel.<br /><br />Before reading the book, I read a ton of reviews on here.  There were many that stated how awful the ending was, so I braced myself to be disappointed.  It was quite the contrary.  I felt the ending was appropriate.  It's by far the best book I've read all year.  I can't wait to read her other books!
B00005JLEU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie as a kid and just recently stumbled upon it once again on Amazon and had to place an order! Arrived on time as always thanks to Amazon insanely fast shipping and packaging was nicely done. The DVD set comes with all the awesome features I never seen before when the original came out in 2002. One prized gem to be kept in the top ten movie collections! This product can't go wrong! It would be amazing if the developers would create an HD Blu-Ray release but even with or without, the story and characters make this set exactly what I had imagined many years back.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Another great game by Big Fish Games; entertaining and well done.  Interesting HOG and good mini games.  I have never been disappointed by this dev.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use, love that you have access to so many translations, and it was free! There are options available within the app that I've yet to use; but the note feature is easy and used often.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|No complaints here, it's a fun, challenging puzzle game. It's frustrating at times but that's part if it's appeal. It starts very basic and quickly gets difficult. figuring out the color combos is part of the puzzle.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a very fast read. It's very much the reflection of the drama in the different stages of relationships; how relationships evolve over time. It is so typical that you just must find out how it all ends.
030726839X|5.0|This is a great read read for anyone with an interest in WW II, Churchill, or enjoys Max Hastings' work. Hastings paints a very different picture from the standard portrait of the valiant figure supported by the entire English nation. How Churchill managed to essentially will his country to continue the struggle against Nazi Germany until the twin salvations of the entry of the U.S.S.R. and U.S.A. is vividly told.
030758836X|5.0|This is my second Gillian Flynn novel & I've got to say she is an author to watch. Her books are amazing, complex, character driven thrillers. I can't wait to read more.<br /><br />Gone Girl was a great book. In a nutshell it's about Amy Dunne, a woman who goes missing on her 5th year wedding anniversary. The book rotates from her husband Nick's POV as the investigation goes on & he becomes the prime suspect, to Amy's POV through past diary entries. It's impossible to say much more without giving stuff away but this was a great way to see how different both characters view things.<br /><br />But there's so much more going on. It's disturbing, it's thrilling, it's all over the place. It's insightful & unsettling the way Flynn writes about people, marriage,'relationships, men & women.  Both characters are richly drawn & I found myself being unable to put the book down until I finally knew what was going on.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed if you read this book.....but it may leave you glancing at your significant other, wondering, how well can one person really know another?

0061900656|5.0|The main message that this book tries to get through is that the \\"big brother\\" is still loved just as much as before, and that the \\"new baby\\" (non-gender) is a good thing for the family and for him. This is not a message that is always believable by the \\"big brother\\" since he has lost a great deal of his parent's time and attention, but it bears repeating. It is also something that opens him up to express feelings and observations that he might not have voiced before and now you know what is going through his mind a little better. A lot of thought and empathy went into the writing of this book and they are complimented by the calm and colorful illustrations.<br /><br />Will it prevent jealousy, backsliding, and attention-getting misbehavior? No. But, whatever reassurance you can give the your child or grandchild that he is no less loved or important than he was before the blessed event is well-worth doing. Spending time together reading this book (and the conversations it engenders) is a wonderful thing. It is a boost to his self esteem and time set aside just for him.

B005FITIGO|5.0|That film is a pamphlet against an unregulated financial market and the story of that catastrophe that occurred in 2008 started after the 1929 crisis when Keynesian policies of all types were instated for individuals to buy on credit and even for the states to do the same. These policies have produced the credit crisis in Europe that we know now; Then in the 70s and 80s, especially with Reagan, and then when the Soviet bloc was out of the picture and no international competition was to be taken into account, we decided to get rid of all regulations on financial markets. Happy were the Chinese who recuperated Hong Kong in 1999 and kept a strict control over their financial markets.<br /><br />This deregulation of financial markets produced the subprime crisis that we know in 2008. But we have to keep in mind that we are all responsible because we elected the politicians we elected and we let them do anything and they on their side let the financiers do anything they wanted. And we know what happened and what we are still suffering because of it.<br /><br />The film does not concentrate on the horrific trauma the crisis is for the simple traders of the financial firm that is considered here. It concentrates on how the crisis can be managed by this firm who is happy to know before everyone else. They find out when the assistant sale manager who was just let go and who had devised a program to assess the financial situation of the firm, gives the USB key with it on his way out to the young rocket engineer who runs it and is able to project the present situation into the future. Too late boys and girls: in less than a week the whole financial Titanic hits rock bottom two miles under the iceberg.<br /><br />Within two days the truth must have come out, first day and first night, and then the problem must be solved to avoid bankruptcy and judicial lawsuits, second day. The boss then has to take a decision and it is simple. In the second day of this two day emergency 93% of all the spoiled assets must be sold, even at a loss. Better lose 20% than everything. And it has to be done by the traders who must be convinced to do it before the Stock Exchange closes in the afternoon.<br /><br />They are motivated with the announcement that they will all lose their jobs but that everyone who will reach the selling quota of 93% will get a more than one million premium, and if the department manages the same global quota, each trader will get an extra more than one million premium, nearly three millions all together. And they will do it, they will cut the branch on which they are sitting because of this nice little parachute or cushion given to them to soften the fall. Speak of faithfulness and loyalty.<br /><br />During that time the boss is playing his associates, deputies and other executives one against the others to select the two or three he will need afterwards. Because they liquidate their own firm, they lose all credibility and all customers, but since the crisis will explode just after that black day, which is a Friday of course, they will be accused of having started it, but in the longer run they will become geniuses and will recuperate their credibility and credit to start a new adventure, a financial speculative adventure of course, no matter what the conditions will be then.<br /><br />But you cannot flush the financial markets out of the picture. You have to get them under control and keep them under control. If we just blazed these financial firms out of the way we would be forgetting that we ALL need what they are providing: credit. We have an instalment purchasing plan here for a car, a house, a washing machine. We have a credit card there that gives us free or nearly free credit for slightly more than a month, though we cannot afford to overdraw at the end of the month when the credit card payments are balanced from your account, except if we can pay a 16 or 18% interest.<br /><br />And I repeat we are all responsible becausewe elected those who let the speculators come into the picture at first through the chimney like Santa Claus then through the window, finally through the door, at first under the table, then around the table and finally in the middle of the table top. It is high time proper authorities put all these financial people under control and get us rid of the immoral ones, those who are so un-ethical that you cannot reform them any more. That is difficult, that will be difficult, that will hurt. Let's hope all will foot the bill proportionally to their resources and means.<br /><br />And dram on the ending that is so similar to the end of Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, the salesman planting carrot seeds at night in his garden that does not get any sunshine anyway.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUwe elected those who let the speculators come into the picture at first through the chimney like Santa Claus then through the window, finally through the door, at first under the table, then around the table and finally in the middle of the table top.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Well, being a 63 year old lady, most folks think I am nuts for loving The Walking Dead!  But I have found friends who agree that it is a wonderful , well-written series and is gathering \\"herds\\" lol of fans!!  I was looking for Season 2 on DVD and finally found it on Amazon and ordered it.  To my pleasant surprise, I got a discount after the sale~~!  Thank you for that!  Money is tight in this failing economy and every little break helps a lot.<br /><br />The DVD delivered as promised and is awesome.  All the special features just mesmerized me.  I am now awaiting Oct. 14 and the Season 3 premiere.  And when it is all over I will order it on DVD also!!  Hopefully you will have it soon after the Finale in 2013.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed in this DVD.  If you are a true WD fan, it is a must have!!  Enjoy!!

0425263908|5.0|I stumbled upon this book because it was sitting next to the 50 Shades books (which there is no comparison to me) and didn't want it to end.  I even went back and retread it because I have been counting down the days until the next book in the trilogy comes out.  The relationship between Eva and Gideon is one that will draw you in and wanting to know more about their story.  Sylvia Day is an excellent writer and has a gift to draw readers into her stories.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|It was a quick read.  Interesting peek into the not so glamorous side of being a Navy Seal.  The story about the actual assault and capture was interesting and the supporting details help paint the picture of how it happened.  Didn't see how the DOD could claim it contained any classified material.  Read mostly like a sequel to the movie starring Charlie Sheen and Michael Biehn.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Avengers is out on DVD and Blu-ray and wow was it ever well-worth the wait. I watched the 3D version first thing and it just blew me away with how fantastic it looks on my home setup. I saw it in the theater in 3D on opening weekend and it looked pretty good but at home it just looks so much better. Get the 3D version if you can, it is fantastic.<br /><br />The movie itself is really great also and does not disappoint in the least. It is a very worthy addition to the Marvel Movie Universe, along with the Iron man, Thor, and Captain America movies. To have all of these great actors and superheroes all on the screen together in the very same movie is just a real treat and this was definitely a summer blockbuster movie that truly lived up to the hype and then some. The action scenes are plentiful and intense, the special effects are jaw-dropping and stunning, and the story is really good too with some good revelations and some unexpected twists and turns. I cannot wait to see what they do in the sequel to this one, it is going to be a very tough act to follow, that's for sure.<br /><br />I rate it HS for HULK SMASHTASTIC.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Fourth in the Mortal Instruments series..The saga wages on between good and evil..Amazingly creative author. 5 stars and well worth the investment of time both reading and purchase price.

B003DNN0L2|4.0|Love this movie! It's not like anything I've ever seen before, which is probably a good part of why I like it. :) It's full of off-the-wall humor, without being totally bizarre. The wonderfully detailed stop-animation is fascinating. The story is fun and family-focused, with many touching moments. And it's an interesting study on anthropomorphism - we see a character struggling to reconcile the instincts of being a wild animal with the morals and inbuilt conscience of being quasi-human. Mr. Fox sums himself up pretty well: \\"I think I have this thing where everybody has to think I'm the greatest, the quote unquote \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\\" And if they aren't completely knocked out and dazzled and slightly intimidated by me, I don't feel good about myself.\\"<br /><br />The one and only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is the inventive use of the word \\"cuss\\" - the characters use it several times throughout the film, in place of language ranging from mild to downright vulgar. I appreciate that they didn't put any actual language in the script; but at the same time, it's a little too easy to \\"fill in the blank\\" and I find that irritating. :/<br /><br />You won't find a movie quite like 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' anywhere else. If you're like me and appreciate \\"random\\" and \\"different\\", you'll enjoy this one. After all, in the words of Mrs. Fox: \\"We're all different.... But there's something kind of fantastic about that, isn't there?\\"
B0041RTE50|5.0|As indicated in the title of my review, customers are charged per episode to view the series, so this is not for the entire movie. The production itself is superior, and I rate it five stars.<br /><br />Being an avid Jane Austen fan, I have watched every single adaptation of Emma (as well as Austen's other works). The older 1972 BBC adaptation, Emma (BBC, 1972) was quite tepid and the lead actress was not very inspiring in her role, lacking the upbeat, and sunny disposition that one associates with Austen's character. Then there was the A&E version starring Kate Beckinsale in the title role, in Emma (A&E, 1997) which though much better than the 1972 version (which also suffered from inferior production qualities), was still not the best adaptation. Finally, there was the movie version of \\"Emma\\" starring Gwyneth Paltrow, and until this current adaptation, this was actually my personal favorite (even though I personally found Paltrow's accent rather stilted)- it was a gorgeous movie with beautiful cinematography and the chemistry between Emma (Paltrow) and Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Northam) was simply wonderful and altogether credible.<br /><br />This is truly a stellar production in terms of casting, and production qualities. The title role of Emma is credibly portrayed by Romola Garai, who has also been in other notable productions such as I Capture the Castle,and Daniel Deronda. She is perfectly cast - luminously beautiful, snooty, a busybody matchmaker wannabe who feels self-justified in her quest to pair off couples regardless of their own wishes, and yet possessing of a warm and sunny disposition. Romola Garai convincingly portrays all of Emma's characteristics - both her lovable and annoying qualities, her immaturity and impetuousness, and also shows her ability to transform from a self-centered immature young girl into a mature woman who realizes her flaws.<br /><br />The other lead is of course Mr. Knightley, and he is also convincingly portrayed by Johnny Lee Miller, who had portrayed Edmund Bertram in the 1999 movie adaptation of \\"Mansfield Park\\"Mansfield Park (1999) which was rather reviled by critics and purists alike for its liberal adaptation of Austen's classic. Miller was also excellent as Lord Byron in Byron.I was quite concerned initially because I had always thought Jeremy Northam's portrayal of Knightley to be the best thus far, but Miller comes close, and in fact brings a new interpretation to the character that I really appreciated. There is this one scene in the series where Emma invites Knightley to dance, and as they dance...viewers get the sense that these are two individuals who are gradually realizing their real chemistry, not just as childhood friends and relatives-in-law, but as true soulmates. It is definitely one of the most romantic parts of the series and a highlight!<br /><br />The other characters are also generally well-cast - Mr. Woodhouse is played to delightful effect by Michael Gambon (aka Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movie franchise); Harriet Smith is portrayed by Louise Dylan (though I still prefer Toni Collette's portrayal of Harriet in the movie version); the talented Jodhi May plays Emma's governess turned Mrs Weston (Jodhi May is a veteran of BBC productions and Henry James' The Turn of the Screw, The Other Boleyn Girl (2003 BBC Version), as well as others, including the coincidence that she was also in Daniel Deronda cast as the Jewess Mirah Lapidoth who attracts the attentions of Daniel Deronda, showcase her diverse acting talent); Frank Churchill is portrayed by Rupert Evans and I must say this particular adaptation portrays Frank Churchill in a thoroughly unflattering light - the man is simply infuriating, and gives Mr. Elton a run for his money! Mr. Elton is played by Blake Ritson who recently portrayed Edmund Bertram in Masterpiece Theatre: Mansfield Park.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent, capturing the beauty of the lush English countryside through the seasons, and the score is memorable (I still cannot get the music from the Emma-Knightley dance out of my mind!). The costumes are gorgeous - simple in their beauty, yet detailed and period-accurate, and the other production qualities are impeccable (the English manor houses picked for the various residences such as Hartfield etc are well-chosen).<br /><br />Austen purists might take issue with some of the liberties taken here - the way the characters are portrayed, missing dialogue, the sequencing of certain story arcs, etc - but I still loved this adaptation - it is sunny, and bright, and all that I love in an Austen adaptation, and it is certainly my favorite adaptation of \\"Emma\\" thus far!he score is memorable (I still cannot get the music from the Emma-Knightley dance out of my mind!).

B0068MNO4S|1.0|A tale told by an Emmerich is likely to be full of sound, special effects and fury signifying very little indeed.  Roland Emmerich's film \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\", which collected carbon credits from the global warming community that was engaging world government politicians at the time of the film's release, depicted a world where the seas rose and froze, so that outside the windows of the New York Public Library a great oil tanker hove to and froze there.  Readers trapped inside the building warmed themselves in the stacks by consigning all the priceless volumes to the flames; all but the last copy of Gutenberg's 1455 Bible, that an extra from the cast of thousands was clutching (in a gross Emmerich touch) to his heart, to save for posterity. Before \\"Anonymous\\", this sentimental touch marked the highpoint of Roland's engagement with early printed literature.<br /><br />After demurely treading the red carpet, past a vision of the beautiful back of Joely Richardson; it was evident on the evening of October 26th, 2011, as Roland Emmerich himself introduced us to the cast, before its first showing at The Mayfair Hotel Gala Premiere, of \\"Anonymous\\" at The Empire Leicester Square, that the personable Roland has a serviceable but Berlitz grasp of the English language.  This did not bode well for lovers of English literature, even though, next, we were advised by a luminary of the British Film Institute that we were in for a \\"rare treat\\" that would, despite the nature of the subject matter, also be \\"thrilling\\".  After it was all over, the audience dutifully clapped as the credits rolled.  As we rushed to burst out of the fire exit doors into London's night air, we heard the same labourers at the coalface of the entertainment business, working a little louder with their picks and shovels as the name of Rhys Ifans and that same Joely Richardson went by.<br /><br />Joely Richardson herself, seated in front of us, was in a good position to see that there were many empty seatsin the imposing arena.  Perhaps it was this realisation that galvanised that moiety, determined to have a good time, to make up with laughter for points when her execrable colleague, cast as the man from Stratford (Timothy Spall), made up to look like the Stratford Monument, failed to entertain in the least. The film might have brought the issue of authorship into the fogs of daylight at last. I understand, in a protest from orthodox scholars, when the film was released, that the statue of the husband of Ann Hathaway in Stratford was covered for the opening day, in a white sheet.  Here we have Stanley Wells, winding his dynamo for one last bicycle-lamp-flicker of publicity before he joins Halliwell-Phillips in the similarly white-sheeted and gated community of old scholars in the sky.<br /><br />Edward de Vere is however a worthy creation, a beautiful man, a sensitive man; but larded by Orloff with ludicrous words more suited to an English North Country disc jockey with a cigar.  The nadir of his delivery must be when he explains to his unsupportive wife, late in this execrable piece of work: \\"I hear these voices in my head and I have to write them down.\\" There is none of the \\"monstrous adversary\\" that Nelson documented; nothing of the charismatic jousting champion, the great gold and vermilion knight of the sun and the East Anglian superstar.  The idea that he is actually the son of Queen Elizabeth, the old boot he also manages to copulate with, against all the odds of the folds of fabric which she is beset by, was surely designed to attract derision.<br /><br />Mark Rylance, by his own admission, never reads his reviews.  This inclination probably informs the worst of his work; which was plumbed when he walked around, like a Hever brass rubbing of Thomas Bullen, in \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\".  Mark, upstaged once more by the vasty fields of his own costume, as he was on the cover of the recent book \\"Dating Shakespeare\\", appeared once more for us in a great pair of pantaloons; this time mincing the speech that opens Henry V: \\"O for a muse of fire\\".  Is it possible that such a magical introduction describing itself the essence of theatre, such instantly engaging words, such inspired words, will ever be brought down so low again?  As Mark opens his mouth, was there ever a more piping or a more wooden \\"O\\"?<br /><br />The film is a travesty.  Oxfordians have waited a long time for it, full of hope that it might be a sincere attempt to present theories about the nature of the writer we know as Shakespeare; that themselves might be illuminating even if we did not agree with them.  In the current climate, I am hard put to mention that John Orloff (may his tribe increase) scripts the recent non-Catholic word \\"bloody\\" for use; but that cullion word celebrated by The Sex Pistols also puts in an appearance; anachronisms as out of place, as Kate Winslet giving \\"the finger\\" on her way to steerage as the lift door closes for the film \\"Titanic\\".  It's an egregious insult to the intelligence of any audience strapped in to take it lying down.<br /><br />Perhaps this film, by making such a derisory fiction of what has occupied Oxfordians, and the likes of Nina Green and Peter W.Dickson, for so long, beyond the calls of reason; will bring an end to the Sisyphean struggle because it has all been made, in one powerful sweep of the mighty cinema, to appear so nonsensical.<br /><br />The IMDB.com encyclopaedic database, reports that the film has an estimated budget of $30,000,000; but in its first month took only $4,152,954 (USA) (20 November 2011).  This very frosty response of the cinema-going hordes is not computer-generated. It is the real thing that slowly freezes pipes; a blockbuster. The film will need more than Derek Jacobi's scarf to keep out, for everyone associated with the film, future encroachments of this cold.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|the best game I have played in a long time. well worth buying.  great graphics and story. wish there were more games like this.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|So I had a friend who got this, and I just fell in love with it. So I bought my own! It's really fun, almost too much fun. You can just take it to Walmart and sonic all of the food and the people. It's a lot of fun.<br /><br />It's quite durable, but you have to be careful, you can loose various parts. But overall it's alright. If you're gonna cosplay it's alright if it's just for fun, and you're not going for a completely official looking screwdriver. So far it's lasted. I definitely think it's something great to buy for a Whovian!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|i really liked this game. very fun and great story. cant wait for the second part to come out. i will tell others about this game.
B007SGM084|5.0|This Trilogy is as I stated in the title; complete seduction and captivation from start to finish on each and every page. So absolutely riveting that you simply cannot put it down at night until you are literally falling asleep out of PURE exhaustion from staying awake far later than you should reading night after night.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|works great on kindle fire. the best game I have ever played on a mobile device. well worth the price. large game because it has so much to it.  if it wont load just get rid of other things to make room for it.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|\\"Tempest\\" is one of the most anticipated albums of Bob Dylan's storied career, and keeps alive his consistently high and definitely eccentric home-stretch string of albums and tours (The \\"Never-Ending Tour\\" and his phenomenal, long-time band undoubtedly have helped) that started with \\"Time Out of Mind.\\" Dylan always has seen himself as a song-and-dance man, and the western-swing, nearly show-tune feel of much of his recent work is on display in the opener, \\"Duquesne Whistle.\\" You can almost see him decked out like the Train Conductor for a ride you may not survive, but if you do, you will have many lifetimes of stories to tell.  As has been written elsewhere, there are some violent themes and characters throughout \\"Tempest\\", with Dylan and band providing a backdrop dripping with some of the dirtiest blues and most rollicking folk of his career. The subtle use of fiddle, percussion, whistle and accordion (some courtesy of the remarkable David Hidalgo) enhance the sound to tell a story of its own.  Along with the opener, \\"Scarlet Town,\\" the jaw-dropping title track, which cleverly combines fact and fiction in the story of that famous ship, and the emotional closer \\"Roll On John\\" about close friend Mr. Lennon, show \\"Zimmy\\" at his most incisive and most human.  His voice? As Dylan biographer Paul Williams has said, his music and writing are centered around his vocal style, and this is true.  The sandpaper-and-nails character of his pipes will be harder than ever for non-fans or casual listeners to swallow, but it's lived-in and lived-hard nature is an essential part of the storytelling of \\"Tempest\\" (Dylan has become more novelist than poet at this point), and there is alongside the harshness an equal amount of warmth that isn't always associated with him (\\"Soon After Midnight\\" and \\"Tin Angel\\" along with \\"Roll On John,\\" which along with the title cut make up two of the most stunning album closers in a long time and by anyone). There are a couple of throwaway moments, buteven they are fun to listen to, just to hear the band rock out a bit. \\"Tempest\\" is a great place to start for the Dylan fan who may have been away for awhile, and shows the man at yet another creative peak when it would be easy to think otherwise. On the other hand, he is in a dead-heat with label-mate Bruce Springsteen for most consistently bad album artwork.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This brings back so many fun memories as a child at the carnival and I finally got a prize lol!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The Timekeeper is like no other book I have read. Unable to put it down, I read it all in one sitting. The theme was thought provoking and caused me to evaluate my own concept of time and to make some changes in the way I approach my life.  I highly recommend this book.
B0098VXE50|5.0|This was a great movie because it took the basic premise of \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\\" and changed it into a neat noir fantasy.  I thought the fact that the dwarves were well known actors like Ian McShane was interesting, because of the special effects they still looked like dwarves.  ALL of the special effects were very good, and in my opinion, Charlize Theron was perfect!  I'm not a fan of morose Kristen Stewart, but the movie was good enough that I was able to ignore her.  It was beautiful to watch, and fascinating enough to hold my interest, and I would recommend it to anyone.  I loved it, and will probably watch it again after a few months.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie...good story line, the evil queen did a great job...somewhat dark and evil but my husband and teenage kids all liked it
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is a lot of fun.  just wish the game was longer. similar to the angery birds games but different enough to make it fun.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Quick read and funny- I don't usually pick up this kind of book, but it was a book club selection. I really enjoyed it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is the best game of this type ive played yet. its so long! you definitely get your moneys worth. and its pretty spooky. made me jump a couple times. I was glued to my kindle for days. you wont be sorry for picking this one up.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This DVD collection is a must have for fans of the series. For those who are unfamiliar with Once Upon a Time, I would highly recommend it for fans of the fantasy genre. Fans of mystery, supernatural and dramas would also enjoy this. A good description for this series would to call it a fairytale version of Lost.  The price on Amazon is one of the best and the cost per episode it is a good deal.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Fun and if you like quick and easy puzzels this is for you. Now if you like lots of pieces. and those thar challenge you then skip this one. You can get some that are free but others you have to buy if you want more puzzels to do that goes with this game.
0439023521|5.0|It's so interesting that I can't easily put it down. My son talked me into reading this book cause he enjoyed it so much, and I have to say that I really didn't expect to get into it, but I was wrong.
B000VUCIZE|5.0|Sam Harris analyzes the major religions from a logical,  evidentiary,  and critical standpoint.  Harris being a neuroscientist,  writes the book almost from the standpoint of a psychologist,  attempting to analyze the ideas that encompass he major religions.
1451662432|1.0|I have to admit that I haven't read the book, now will I.  I do admire Arnold's determination to be successful in his chosen profession.  Having said this, his total disregard for his wife in every aspect of their lives together (she gave up her career for him, folks!) prove he is selfish, manipulative and downright offensive.  But he had help.  Maria enabled him to treat her with casual disrespect and this I find truly disturbing.  I also find her defense of him, especially during his run for governor, to be the highest form of denial and self-loathing.
0316228532|2.0|I LOVE the HP books.  As an adult, I just marvel at Rowling's ability to weave a complex story... she just thinks of EVERYTHING.  She's funny, and I loved most of all the \\"life lessons\\" of good-vs-evil, with there being both real evil and real good; imperfect characters who strive to do the right thing.  We cheer for the hard but fair teachers like Minerva McGonogal and Dumbledore.  We love the devoted (though far from perfect) families.<br /><br />This book is clearly from the same pen.  Good writing.  Funny, witty.  Layered, interweaving story.  But... no good-vs-evil... just lots of casual evil v slightly less evil.  No good teachers who are hard and fair, really.  No functional families.  I get what she's trying to do, I think-- to convey a sense of having to help the unfortunate as part of maintaining human hope & decency, NOT merely to see our efforts \\"work.\\"  She successfully shows much strife for the mean pettiness it is.<br /><br />WAY too much swearing.  Way too much graphic sex-- or casual sex, or mention of sex, or mention of thoughts of sex.  Way too much graphic everything.  (Many times the f-bomb dropped right in the middle of Jesus' name, which is offensive to me).  It reminded me of Daniel Radcliff (who played HP in the movies) going out and riding a horse naked on stage the second he turned 18, trying too hard to prove \\"I'm NOT a child actor anymore!\\"<br /><br />Rowling could have done all the things she set out to do without going overboard on the sex & violence.  I felt dirty reading this book.<br /><br />I swapped it out for \\"Kisses for Katie,\\" the true story of a teenager who has started a faith-based ministry feeding & schooling children in Uganda as well as adopting 13 girls... by age 22.  THAT book confronted so much darkness and suffering, yet left me encouraged and strengthened to do my part, rejoicing.  Totally different genre, yes, but the contrast stuck with me.
1439153663|5.0|Excellent read. Could not put it down. Gave it to a friend for her birthday & she loved it. Also could not put it down.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This was one of the best series I've ever watched. I watched it in 3 days it was that good. I highly recommend this show. Damian Lewis is one of the best actors to come along in a long time. This show wons 6 emmys! Yay!!!!
0316228532|1.0|This is the only review I have ever written.  I have never felt the need to tell people to save their money on a book before.  This book is painful to read.  I made it half way through the book, before I put it down for good.  I expected so much more from this author.
B0088749CW|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie. I realize it won't seem good to everybody, but you should give it a chance and watch for yourself. Don't discount it because of the reviews of others. You might like it, as well.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book, unable to put it down and am eagerly anticipating the next installment!! Perfect balance of storyline and erotic content!

B006S053K8|1.0|Adventureland is the opposite of Superbad in almost every way except the 'coming of age' theme. Where Superbad was immature and funny, Adventureland is serious and 'mature'. The sad thing is Adventureland could've easily been a good comedy if the writers tried, but they didn't. They went for easy indie trite.<br /><br />So what's so damn 'mature' about this film? Sure as hell wasn't the story, it's just another standard coming of age story with 'unique' 'hip' touches. It sure as hell wasn't the characters, they were all one-dimensional cardboard cutouts basically. In fact the only thing that seemed to have time put into it was constructing the excellent soundtrack, but like Garden State, a good soundtrack doesn't make your cheap coming of age story any better.<br /><br />Let's go over the actors: Jesse Eisenberg has the same anti-social vibe from the Social Network (which was infinitely better), acts disinterested in everything, and is ultimately boring. So in other words he's the perfect uncharismatic protaginast! Kristen Stewart actually puts some effort into her acting, but her character is another dull love interest that's 'mature' because she's conflicted between two guys, you know, the same kinda maturity you see on an afternoon soap opera. Ryan Renolds sleepwalks through his performance as some burn out who never changes his expression nor voice to anything but monotone. Bill Hadar is the funny guy I guess? But he's not, he's just a more obvious douchebag than the rest of the cast, and his 'hilarious' moments are when he yells at people sporatically. Martin Starr as the friend had more natural charisma than the leading man, but again, he doesn't do anything like the rest of this dull cast. He kinda just stares off into space with a look that says 'nerd angst'. So they get all of these good actors and don't do ANYTHING with them, it's almost as big a waste of a solid cast as Life Aquatic.<br /><br />The Story: take any coming of age story and apply here.<br /><br />The Interactions: Oh boy, here's where the (unintentional) jokes come in, where to begin? Well speaking of one dimensional characters, there's some squeaker 'ex best friend' to Jesse Eisenberg who always kicks him in the balls, and yet Jesse hangs out with him anyway. It's like the writers are trying to make a familiar character that we all know in real life. And how does his story arc go? Eventually Jesse kicks him in the balls, to signify that he has indeed become a changed person. Barf. You're probably wondering how the conflict ends up between the two guys? Well there isn't any, it all ends with Jesse passive-aggresively calling Ryan an idiot for not knowing a Lou Reed song. And speaking of which the characters seem to compare their music collection like jocks compare penis sizes in a locker room, multiple times someone will say something like \\"I got this new Lou Reed single\\" and someone else is like \\"wow, that's cool, lets totally play it and not be interested in anything going on\\". I think Jesse realizes that he loves Kristen when she puts on Velvet Underground, and Ryan Reynolds is an idiot we should all look down on because he doesn't know that it's obviously Sattelite of Love, duh!<br /><br />It's pretty painful watching how hard this movie tries to be hip, as if it's whole purposes is capturing teen apathy and being unique, but really it's another mass-produced indie film about 'finding yourself' and 'getting laid'. Avoid like it's the album Squeeze.<br />The Interactions: Oh boy, here's where the (unintentional) jokes come in, where to begin?

B0073B587E|4.0|Just three days after arrival (only 3 and a half weeks since ordered, not the One To Four Months they scared me with ;-) it's been a kind of portable multitouch sensation, hardly played home, mostly at bars with stunned people laughing hard (included me) at my \\"retrofuturistic performance\\" (you know, playing retro style BeatleHendrixBowie with 21st century hardware, oh, yes, 21st Century Schizoid Man ;-) attracting everyone interest and curiosity, simply saying......SENSATIONAL!!!<br /><br />BUT......it has his limitations, let's see:<br />  *Possibly because my iPad is first gen, there's some noticeable delay on fingerpicking in Ion app, not that noticeable when strumming. But the main problem for me is the unbalance between tapped notes on neck keys (sorry, non sensitives to velocity) and the ones played on virtual strings or keys on the iPad (sensitive but even hitting hard, much softer)<br />  *No string so no neck bending, but possible with virtual vibrato lever (whammy bar) (on Ion native poor-but-anyway-amazing guitar app) or MOD wheels (on some GarageBand sound, on all Music Studio ones, and on Korg's MS20), even by iPad acelerometer on MusicStudio, not only controling pitch but, alternatively, filters, modulations, arpegiattors etc, really fun to change the sound somehow by moving the whole guitar<br />  *SoSo integration with GarageBand, for example you can't (at least I can't by now) assign a different sound to the neck keys and the iPad virtual keyboard (vkb), you can do that with MusicStudio, only few sounds on percussion sets, compared to one-key-one sound on MusicStudio, some strange behaviour on Smart instruments, well, maybe I'm being too exigent, GarageBand is what it is.... (and I <3  it!)<br />  *Some sounds don't allow playing the same note on neck keys and iPad vkb, some do, I can't see why but maybe related to polyphony or so...<br />  *Mmmmm, let's see, there's something more but...mmmm.....I can't remember (f* hangover!!!;-)<br /><br />Well,I won't derise the product saying ¨just a toy\\" but if you REALLY want to play guitar, buy a real one. If you just want some learning-following-the-lighted-keys and some I-play-music-even-without-knowing-how fun, that the accesory you need (other than the iPad, of course). If you want a MIDI input for the iPad (that's what in essence it is) you'll have to accept the dinamic flattness of the non-sensitive neck keys, but if you don't play piano but guitar, is a giant step on finally sequencing with a \\"guitar (sort of)\\" without spending K$ on hexaphonic stuff. Other than that, you'll be centerstage wherever you appear with this, at least when they first see and hear it, probably when \\"everybody is got one\\" it'll be less sensational.<br /><br />So, the one star missing is for its limitations as a REAL instrument, remember, more than a toy but far less than a professional instrument, but for the price an excellent value, the kids (and not so kids) will LOVE it.<br /><br />I'll update when euphory passes, this weekend has been so hilarious I hardly can be objetive.....<br /><br />Ah, one more thing.....the best musical moment of the weekend:  soloing by tapping neck keys with left hand while \\"arppegiating\\" on GarageBand with right hand ...Groooooooooovy!

B003H4I4JU|5.0|I read these first two books on a recommendation from a friend, and was really surprised how much I enjoyed these books.  I guess for me I was impressed with how well the author touches on concepts, psychological, philosophical, or technological  with so much ease.  He does not spend tons of time stressing these concepts but rather mentions these things in an off handed way.  This is not to say that his explanations lack detail, just that there is good balance between explaining complicated concepts, and storytelling.  Card's vision is the perfect backdrop for so many issues that while relavent today, seem to continue to be things we deal with as humans well into the future.  In his world, human nature doesn't change.  This is what makes these books connect.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to anybody.  Even people who are not currently into the SciFi genre.  This series provides a really good starting point, or introduction to quality Science Fiction.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great game fun for the whole family. challenging brain teasers and action games gives this game a good variety pack!
B007SGM084|2.0|I bought this trilogy because friends recommended it and I've been picking it up and picking at it... There's not enough real content to keep my attention, but admittedly there are juicy islands of salacious sex - actually almost soft porn? - that wake one up for awhile... I probably wouldn't buy it again (& certainly not for $30)...
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a really challenging and fun game! Play it all the time for stress relief. Lots of different manning tiles to match!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The past few fantasy books I have read were disappointing to say the least, so I was hesistant to spend my budget of reading hours on another fantasy novel but I took a chance.  It was well worth the investment of time.  If your looking for lots of elves, dwarfs, and magic...you will probably be disappointed but if your looking for a great story with interesting characters, a unique plot, and excellent writing, I highly recommend this book.  Rothfuss may be one of my new favorite authors.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Whats so sad is that other authors like myself who has had to endure \\"self publishing\\" on my book which is not FILTHY or sado masocist...it doesnt have filth in it, its just a clean story about the exotic adventures of a tour manager \\"CAMELS TO CAVIAR\\"...I cannot find a real publisher so have to go through the rip off of a self publisher.  It is a good, easy read, funny, heartwarming, adventurous book; some psychology, some instructions in travel and with a touch of sex here and there as it cannot be all goodie two shoes.  And yet this publisher gobles up income from trash.  Isnt that the way things go usually?!

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Very dissapointed. After installing and using the game it began to go into endless cycles of a promotion to upgrade to another Rovio product. I have repeatedly contacted Rovio with no results to solve the issue. The worst part is that I enjoy the game.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Read this series in a short span of time and really liked it. did not think i would but glad i got it.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I enjoyed the book; it was an 'easy read'.  I would recommend it to anyone to read.  It was interesting enough that once I started it, I kept reading until I finished it whereas often it takes several weeks for me to read an entire book if I am not really interested in it...
B008XG1X18|4.0|When the app is working correctly I looooove it! What I do not love is the 15% of the time that it just randomly shuts down or locks up. Fix that problem and you have an amazing app.
B002GYI9C4|3.0|Entertaining as far as Fantasy and magic ...<br />Too much Revolution flowing into Religion without, that part NOT well done
B000J1AGQI|2.0|I'm sure my opinion won't be popular here but I can't lie.  I wanted to like this movie, and I wasn't expecting a lot.  Mel Gibson is a great actor but he couldn't carry this film by himself.  There were a few moments that I thought were well done but for the most part it was canned feel-good war porn for baby boomers.  I guess I tend to be a little overly critical, but I couldn't help noticing things like how literally all of the soldiers except for the token black guy were white.  But the token black guy's wife got to make a little speech acknowledging racism, so I guess they covered that base.  And the movie went out of its way to touch on all the excuses for the American failure in Vietnam so it could still glorify the noble American soldiers.  I just found it hard to stomach stuff like the guy who said he wanted to help orphans, not make them to which Mel's response was to pray to God to help them \\"blow up those heathen bastards\\".  And then he tells his daughter that war is when he has to go stop bad men from killing people.  I thought those scenes made him look like a two-faced sociopath but the movie continues to treat him like a heroic figure.<br /><br />The other actors' performances were mostly forgettable, although I have to admit that some of the scenes probably lost a lot of their impact from having been done to death, and done much better in other movies just like this one.  And a lot of the gore seems just thrown in for shock value, I mean how many times do we have to watch body parts exploding in slow motion accompanied by inspirational music?  The bad guys in this film, meaning the politicians and the vietnamese, were one-dimensional caricatures.  I don't need for a movie to be historically accurate or morally responsible to enjoy it, but halfway through this film I wanted it to be done and I kept saying \\"seriously?\\"
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|Same as book one ... Fantasy - good. Philosophy - bad<br />I liked the voices in peoples heads - well done, but<br />otherwise, the philosophy is treading a dangerous ground for<br />the folks less religiously inclined
B007I2BZIE|3.0|After listening to Clockwork Angels for five weeks on my hi quality 2-channel stereo system I have concluded that it has a very harsh \\"digital\\" sound. I'm referring to both the audio quality and many of the compositions. For comparison, the old albums that were produced by Terry Brown have a clear natural inviting sound and the songs flow. I feel that Clockwork cannot be listened to loud on my home system because it sounds too harsh and computerized which is more obvious with a good stereo and at higher volumes. To put it simply, Clockwork annoys my ears but the earlier Rush albums sound good when I turn up the volume. You can easily tell which pieces were overdubbed and added like as if the producer and mixer did copy and paste of various pieces. I really like five of the songs and I can listen to it in the car or at low to moderate volume at home. Maybe it is just another album that was sewn together from a bunch of email atachments. Hopefully their next album will be recorded with all three musicians playing simultaneously and without the harsh sound that comes from too much computer editing.

B0081L391C|5.0|As I'm sure you've heard, this movie doesn't have much to do with the original 21 Jump Street. It's more of a high school action/comedy, which I think is actually a good thing. At one point they even mock the premise of rehashing another 80s show because Hollywood has no originality. Ice cube plays an angry black man while acknowledging the trope of the ABM in one of his angry rants. One of the funniest parts for me were the over-the-top setups for massive explosions which didn't go off. I understand that it is counter-intuitive that there wouldn't be huge explosions in an action movie but just watch it and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. Clearly the writers new that they were just cashing in on name recognition and managed to use that to make an action comedy that is far more fun than anything that has come out in a long time.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a pretty fun time killer. I refuse to spend money on any virtal game so I'll never buy more coins. But this is good to kill time at orthodox and Dr. appointments

1449314287|5.0|\\"High Performance MySQL\\" is required reading for anyone who needs to dig deeper than MySQL 101. It's well organized, extremely well written for a technical book, and targets its content at exactly the right level: toward people who have the MySQL basics down, but are looking to add to their understanding and knowledge of MySQL in order to tackle both everyday and more esoteric problems. The writers do an excellent job of explaining how everything is working and fitting together in the background, which has certainly given me a clearer picture of MySQL's architecture, which in turn provides a better basis for problem-solving. This book is full of practical tips that are clearly based in the real-world troubleshooting experience of the authors.  Highly recommended.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought it had really good action and good plot. I was just too cartoony for me. Overall a movie I would watch again
B0002HWQEE|5.0|The little dog is well balanced,with a beautiful finish that resists chipping. The head turns, the ears can be moved and the tail boinged. The colors attract  attention, very well made and babies love this dachshund. Simple and well designed, this one can move on to be used in the older childs play too. Elegant.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I was not sure what to expect as the follow-up to the Harry Potter books from JK Rowling, so I came with no preconceived ideas on what this book should be, or would be when I bought it.  While a bit disappointing, it was still worth reading.<br /><br />To me, the Harry Potter series, started off with some fantastic ideas, and sunk deeper into the darker struggles of the characters as they aged.  This book parallels that somewhat, as we get to meet the characters, see the struggle, and get a final (if somewhat jarring) result.  (SPOILER:  It is as if Harry Potter's wand mis-fired and killed him at the end of the first book).<br /><br />Like actor Anne Hathaway jettisoning the 'Princess Diaries' persona to get to more serious roles by making 'Havoc,' 'The Casual Vacancy' uses adult language and situations gratuitously.  To say that it is a serious piece of literature would be a mistake, but, hopefully, it will allow Ms. Rowling more freedom of expression in her future work.  I found her writing style to be too basic, but typical of books for general release of the last few years.  Maybe she is having a problem shaking her HP-mode.<br /><br />As adult as the book is portrayed in the press, the only real and interesting characters are the teens.  The adult characters seem to be more caricatures of political positions and medical conditions.  Unfortunately, even the teens seem to be characters that come from British pop culture like the main characters from the movie, 'Bend it Like Beckham,' or the rapper Lady Sovereign.  Boiled down, it is really the tale of Barry and Krystal with a large supporting cast.  While I would not recommend it for children or young teens, it is a fable that someone over eighteen years old could get something from.<br /><br />That said, Ms. Rowling has once again developed an interesting setting that is detailed enough that we feel that we have been there, and could walk around without a map.  We get to know the characters well enough to acknowledge them as they passed on the street.  The first third of the book lays out the background in a plodding manner, but once past the workmanlike exposition (read: boring infodump), the book becomes harder to put down as you go. There is not a huge payoff, but there is a sound story with a heavy load of emotions in this book.  We may not agree with some of the ideas that the author is trying to advance, but she is very clear how she thinks. It will at least make you think, if not feel.<br /><br />Personally, I wouldn't recommend the book to everyone.  But if you do start, you have to keep going!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I saw it in the theater and could not wait for the DVD release.  It is full of action, special effects and wise cracks.  As always Robert Downey Jr steals the show.  I can't wait for another!
B009329ZF2|1.0|This is one slick advertisment.  I imagine the navy donated a massive amount of time and resources to this project.  If you want to be manipulated, watch this film...Come on kids...get out there and die for 'merica. Go fighting Teabags.

030758836X|3.0|Something must have gone way over my head girl, because I did not \\"get\\" the ending.  I agree with someone else here who said it seemed the author didn't know how to end the book so she just stopped writing...so what a big disappointment the ending was. I read the last chapter a few times and I still don't know how the story ends.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had been waiting for this book at my local library for a couple of months but as soon as my Kindle came in, I downloaded and had it read very quickly.  A good book!  Well written!

B0058YPGVQ|2.0|I missed some of the last season, and wanted to catch up. Unfortunately, disc #1 is bad. It skips, freezes, just all around bad news. Disc 2 and 3 are fine, but that's not the point. I asked for a return, and was emailed the forms. IU sent the set back, asking for a replacement, but got a credit instead. Oh well, at least I got my money back. Amazon is always great to deal with, and this is not their fault.
B0081L391C|5.0|LISTEN UP!! The police are a big part of our lives. We always hear about their accomplishments on the news. However, they usually only mention the major drug crimes. You never hear about the high school ones. Well the wait is over! You can finally hear one about the hilarious story behind it in 21 Jump Street.<br />By now you would have probably realized this was a TV show back in 1987-1991, but the directors did a great job \\"modernizing\\" this film according to People Magazine and The Washington Post magazine. Directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller are extremely good at what they do and make the entire world burst out with laughter. Together, these men created and write for the hit TV \\"friends\\" and the hit kids movie, \\"cloudy with a chance of meatballs.\\"<br />This movie contains the story about how two high school opposites join the force and become best friends to help each other pass the police academy. They stink at being regular cops so they are appointed to a secret division called \\"21 Jump Street.\\" Together they face hilarious situations, violent gangs, and party-loving teenagers.<br />This top selling box office film has been on the top for four weeks! According to rottontomates.com, 98.6 percent of people loved and laughed a lot during this movie. Fans on Fandango.com said this is a \\"must-see\\" movie. That's the highest rating a movie can have. In addition to all of these good words, Everyone loves this movie on yelp.com. Everyone is going to be talking about so don't you want to be able to contribute to the conversation.<br />The actors in this movie are brilliantly chosen because they truly look like the characters they playing, many say they were born to play these roles. These well known actors are Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube. Yes, all of these actors have been in hilarious movies such as Superbad and Kick A**, . If you liked the movies Superbad, The Dictator, Borat, ted, and 17 again, you will love this movie.<br />This movie is very easy to find, it is in every theater, in redbox, in blockbuster, and in the top five movies on the iTunes store. This movie is also always running on the movie channels such as FX, Starz, and Cinamax. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone who likes a good comedy.<br />21 Jump Street is the hit movie sweeping the nation and racing up the box office charts, basically everyone loves this movie and there is a pretty good chance you'll love it too. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone who likes to laugh, enjoys comedies, and loves a good time.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I gave into temptation and bought 'The Casual Vacancy' minutes before it was released on Kindle. It was not long before I regretted my impulsive buying. Some of the language I found to be rather contrived and forced. A minor detail. At times the writing lost its forward flow. Again, a minor detail. Certainly there was the promised humour but with a flippancy that seemed to remove reality from the characters. It was not long before the characters' lives exposed themselves for what they were or for what they were to become, humour being overtaken by the stark reality of gloom and doom. This was to be the focus of the much larger part of the book and  made the book as a whole seem out of balance. The endless, sordid and squalid misery in the lives of the over-ample sufficiency of characters presented me with nothing beyond my awareness of life for some people. A year of Coronation Street on paper. Here was an opportunity to offer our troubled society some possible solutions for consideration. But, alas, this did not happen.<br /><br />What was Ms Rowling's aim in writing the 'The Casual Vacancy'? Was it to portray the effects of sick, violent or morally defficient parents on their children? Was it to point out that most people have skeletons in the cupboard? Was it to illustrate the dangers of sex, drugs and alcohol on teenagers? Or the effects of lack of love in families and relationships? Was it to depict the universal law of Cause and Effect? I do not know! Does Ms Rowling? But it was all there. A hotch-potch of unmitigated misery. Becoming quite sickened by it all I resorted to a quick scan of over a good half of the book, wondering why, in fact, I was bothering to do even that. Well, if I'm honest, I did need to discover what happened to the multitude of characters. But I found the book to be quite depressing and grew to resent being immersed in perpetual darkness of life. Rape, murder, drugs, alcohol abuse, cutting, character assassination, foul language and more. It is with regret that this, my first review, is so unsupportive of Ms Rowling's first adult novel.<br /><br />I am a fan of Harry Potter, even as a septuagenarian, and look forward to the next instalment! I have read that Ms Rowling might entertain us with yet another Harry Potter book. Yes, please!<br /><br />P.S. It would be interesting to see just how much the size of the book was reduced if even eighty percent of the 'f' word was cut!

1439102430|4.0|As usual Kathy Reich's has written an excellent detective story based on the protagonists medical and postmortem skills. The plot goes to a new part of the world and is a good read all the way through. My only regret is the boilerplate ending with Temperance in peril is rather stale
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Amazing book with unexpected twists and turns  .  Wonderfully written and a great read. I can't wait to read more from this author.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is OK... just writing to get the invest points to move forward in the game... nothing more to say... thank you.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bite my lip and flush deep crimson at my inner goddess's poor taste in books. My subconscious rolls her eyes and strolls away. I feel strange muscles clenching deep in my belly. I take a deep breath and PUKE.<br /><br />I have issues with wasted time, but I keep reading, thinking that it just has to get better, but it doesn't. I roll my eyes in disgust thinking that two more epistles await my twitching palm. Excuse me while I go hang my inner goddess with a silver-gray woven tie.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay was a wonderful commentary on human nature, love, uncertainty, war, death, fear and so much more, just like all three of the Hunger Games books were. I read the Trilogy in less than a week and hungered for more, but was very happy with the way Suzanne Collins ended the saga. It was full of surprises but nothing that came out of left field, which are the type of surprises that work in literature. Very satisfying.
0525953728|5.0|Much like the author, how he stated that he was inspired by books on SEALs when he was a kid, I hope that this book inspires a younger generation into aspirations of becoming a SEAL.<br /><br />Good book, not my usual venue, but I loved it.

B0099G3I96|1.0|Seriously No Doubt?<br />Why?<br />Did you need money? I would have sent some if you would have asked. You didn't have to embarrass yourself like this.<br /><br />The album is chaotic, inconsistent and schizophrenic to the point where it doesn't have enough pop for top 40 and lacks the edge and originality for alternative stations.<br /><br />I am very disappointed.

0307749606|1.0|I always bring an audio book with me on long drives, and was excited to get this for my most recent trip.  I didn't think the book was up to par, but what made it worse for me, was the reader.  I had a hard time getting past that.  The female voices were horrible, and Reacher was read with an exaggerated head cold.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I am a retired Army (airborne)soldier. This work was well written, kept my attention throughout,and was not overly technical even though it had to contain many facts and military events just to keep it a truly historical document.<br />Would like to read more of these in the future.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush was the first band I saw live, back in the spring of '79. They changed the way I listened to music. Suffice it to say I have been a fan since then, although I have not always been able to follow them (so to speak). They have gone some places I could not (i.e.-the whole synth-drenched phase in the 80's).<br />Clockwork Angels is the best album they've done in years. I'm not going to pick it apart track-by-track and spoil the magic for anyone who has not yet heard it. I will say that Clockwork combines the best elements of both the classic and modern Rush sounds on a concept album that tells a great story. My personal faves (if it matters) are \\"BU2B\\", \\"The Anarchist\\", \\"Halo Effect\\" \\"Wish Them Well\\", and \\"The Garden\\". But really, the whole album is amazing if you're a Rush fan, not a single clunker on this one.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I like it when a genre can parody its own conventions without slipping into absurdity and this book manages that well.  The 3 codas idea was interesting but it felt as though the author was trying to complete an english class assignment (write in 3 points of view) rather than an organic occurrence.  That 'forced' feel is only thing keeping the book from being 5 stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of those books you are going to love or hate, with that being said I loved it! I could not put it down and I immediately read the other 2 after. This book consumed me and I am not afraid to say it! The story line was great and kept me wanting more, the sex scenes did get a little repititious for me but the overall story was excellent.
B0053O89KG|2.0|I own the first three seasons of \\"Castle\\" and had high hopes for the fourth season.  Regrettably, problems that started to become evident halfway through season three rained down on the series all throughout season four.  By the end of the first episode, it was clear that the engine was beginning to sputter.<br /><br />In brief, here were just a few of \\"Castle's\\" season four misses:<br /><br />1. Castle's \\"big confession\\" from the season three finale - telling Beckett he loved her as she lay near death, and the question of whether she heard or remembered it.  As the season progressed, the endless \\"did she or didn't she\\" became an insult to the viewer.  Why? Because it required the viewer to believe that Beckett was a complete idiot.  The idea that she wasn't already aware of Castle's feelings for her - confession or no confession - was utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />2. Captain Victoria Gates.  Just a bad character all the way around.  A totally unlikeable and one-dimensional caricature of a tyrannical female boss with an enormous chip on her shoulder.  A complete waste of a talented actress like Penny Johnson.<br /><br />3. Castle's wardrobe.  The dashing and debonair mystery writer began adding pounds and dressing like a hobo.  Definitely not okay for a romantic leading man who's pursuing a stunner like Stana Katic.  In real life, maybe.  On television?  Never.<br /><br />4. Supporting cast became annoying and dull.  Alexis' endless whining, Martha's \\"mothering\\", Esposito calling everyone \\"Bro\\".  In season four, they all turned into cartoon characters.<br /><br />5. Nathan Fillion has trouble with drama.  It took me four seasons to realize this, but Nathan Fillion is not convincing doing dramatic scenes.  He does comedy well but seems out of his element when things get serious.<br /><br />I would love so much for the producers to turn things around and breathe some new life into the show.  Based on seeing the season five premiere, however, I am forced to predict that Castle's final season is upon us.  Unfortunate.

B000KX0IOA|4.0|\\"No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include each event, each person who helped shape a lifetime. What can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man...\\" - Preface to the film<br />Gandhi, filmed in 1982 and directed by Richard Attenborough, was a biography film that portrays the dreams and beliefs of a single man so well. The inspiring film started out with a young man, Gandhi, sitting in a first class train car for which he had the ticket to. Because he is of indian decent the trains conductor threatens to throw him off the train if Gandhi does not move back to the third class train car, refusing to move Gandhi gets thrown off the train along with his luggage. Outraged by his treatment, but unwilling to engage in any form of violence, Gandhi began a half-century long battle for political and economic equality for his people. This film did a great job portraying the events that took place in Gandhi's pursuit towards and independent India and does a good job of having them displayed in chronilogical order over decades of time. Gandhi is a film that brings a deep message to the people that view it. As this movie so testifies, Mohandas K. Gandhi understood that peace, justice, and equality for all people could best be achieved through non-violent means. His words and actions displayed  the message throughout his long life.

B001SWA8A6|5.0|Like many people, I saw a movie first. Naturally, due to media constraints, you expect certain amount of the book to be homogenized. Therefore, I wanted to read what was missing. To my amazement very little was missing or modified. I do not normally read this sort of book. Therefore, I was surprised at finding myself wanting more when it finished.<br /><br />In addition, until I read the book I did not realize that Charing Cross Road was a real place. The whole book is based on a collection of correspondence between Helene Hanff, an avid book reader, and Frank Doel an agent for British bookseller.<br /><br />My wife has taken this one-step further and is collecting all the books that were mentioned in the correspondence. Some of these books appear to have been reprinted due to this publication.<br /><br />If you can find it there is a book called \\"The Library of Helene Hanff.\\"<br />I wonder what became of all the other people described in the correspondents after the book.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00003CX8N 84 Charing Cross Road]]
B007X15GRQ|1.0|The movie took around two days to download to my iPad. When I say \\"two days\\" I don't mean it took a long time, and I got impatient. I starting downloading it to watch it on an international trip.  It took around 48 hours to download. I wrote to Amazon customer service to complain, but I was already out of town when they responded asking for the title of the movie I was complaining about.  It slipped my mind until now and it's probably too late to do anything now.  It's the second time I had an issue and I don't think I will ever use the service again.
0451196716|1.0|Every year, 100 teenage boys are selected for the Long Walk. Everyone gets a canteen, processed food belts and 3 warnings. After 3, your simply shot. You must not walk under 4 mph, speed walk, or come to a complete stop. You must not harm or help the other walkers. An interesting premise, of course. But, how Stephen King, (Bachman) can write 370 pages of this psyche, it's very tiresome. It's very effective material, because as Ray Garraty, our protagonist, gets weaker and weaker throughout the walk, mentally and physically. YOU get weaker and weaker during the LONG read. I found myself staggering, tired, rushing to complete this book.<br />And they walk on..and they walk on..and they walk on. A conversation...and they walk on. A 2 page flashback...and they walk on. New terrain...rain...and they walk on.<br />This book is as excruciating to read, as this very review I'm sure.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|Im sure that the product worked well. i only returned it because the office needed another piece of equipment along with this one. So, in lieu of having both, the office manager opted to get one device that could do everything she wanted it to do.<br /><br />Not sure how helpful this review is going to be. But, it doesn't knock the product at least. It did actually work!
B008IGP8LY|3.0|Boy do I love Nolan's Batman score, and Hans Zimmer. But if you enjoy the clean, crisp sound of vinyl. You will not get that on this pressing. So get the CD I suppose. Lots of feedback and clicks, what a downer. Again, this is not the product, which is a five star soundtrack This is about the records somehow flaw at the factory. And that leads to this 3 star review.<br />Thank You.<br />Although, I have recently discovered that if you turn the treble all the way down, it is a little better.

B008PE9GSA|4.0|I've been a fan since the mid 70's and this stuff rocks. This is the best that ZZ Top has put out in decades. La Futura is actually a throw back to the music from the 70's and early 80's. There was a period in the late 80's and 90's when they pumped out really cheesy music/videos. Well that is passed and now they are rocking the blues again. Some of the knuckleheads reviewing this CD have no idea....they think that  Legs was the best ZZ Top song ever. While Legs was ok,  go back and listen to Tres Hombres. BL, this new ZZ Top release is awesome and unexpected...buy it (at Best Buy for the extra songs).

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't been a big reader for the last few years. So this was the first book I have read in a while. I actually watched the movie first and loved it so much I thought it would be worth reading the first book of the trilogy so I could read the rest. Even though I already knew what was gonna happen I loved this book. It is very well written. It is intriging and an easy read at the same time. I have since read the whole series and lived it. I would highly recommend it to anyone from the ages 12 and up.

0385344333|5.0|I've been a Reacher fan from the get-go and although not one of his best \\"A Wanted Man\\" is still Reacher doin' his thing and I liked it.<br /><br />I really enjoy Child's attention to detail be it a weapon or a location, but the one thing that bothered me slightly (and this is REALLY whining) was the scene where Reacher and Sorenson go to McDonald's and he orders his usual cheeseburger and she orders from the breakfast menu. Now I will admit I've not been to every Mc'D's in the nation, but I've been to a lot of them and have never been able to order a cheeseburger before 10:30 in the morning or an Egg McMuffin after 10:30 in the morning. Maybe they should have gone to Burger King.<br /><br />Other than that - no problems. Enjoyed the book and am looking forward to the next one.

B005LAII8K|5.0|Just like Ryan Gosling in 2011, it seems like Joseph Gordon-Levit is in every movie of 2012, most recently \\"Premium Rush\\" and \\"The Dark Knight Rises.\\" In a 2006 film called \\"Brick\\" he hooked up with writer/director Rian Johnson for the first time.  A small film, it showed what Gordon-Levit could do as an actor.<br /><br />In this big budget collaboration, Gordon-Levit is Joe, a hit man of sorts called a looper from 2044 or thereabouts.  His job is to terminate men like him who are sent back from 30 years in the future. Time travel has become possible in the 2070's era but has been outlawed.  But the outlaws have managed to control it for their own use.<br /><br />All time travel films have their complications and while this is no exception, Johnson does a remarkable job keeping it simple.  He even goes so far as to set up a scene where old Joe (Bruce Willis) confronts young Joe in a caf&eacute; about how he not only managed to escape, but what life would be like in the next 30 years.  Old Joe essentially tells him not to over-think the time travel aspect.  The same for the viewer.<br /><br />As hinted above, old Joe comes back but avoids the \\"termination\\" by his younger self by not being bound with a bag over his head.  This surprises young Joe enough for old Joe to get the advantage.  After old Joe escapes, young Joe must follow and kill him or his own existence will be jeopardized.  This chase along with that of a goon squad summonsed by Abe (Jeff Daniels), the man in charge, becomes more complicated because old Joe is also on a mission to kill a young boy.<br /><br />This boy (remarkable Pierce Gagnon) will grow up to have a major influence as the head of the criminal empire of the future and the man who decides to kill all of the older loopers (called closing the loop).  As both young and old Joes center in on the boy, yet another wrinkle develops.  The boy's mother (great performance by Emily Blunt) becomes entangled with young Joe.  All of this leads to a conclusion, unexpected but satisfying.<br /><br />Yes, this is a thinking person's sci fi and yes, you need to pay attention, but it isn't beyond comprehension.  Terrific performances enhance the film which is soaked with adrenaline and tense action sequences. Even the requisite shoot out seems authentic.  Johnson's two future worlds are not filled with spiffy flying cars and laser guns, nor is it a bleak, smog filled world.  It pretty much looks a lot like now with enough evolution to seem real.  This is certainly one of the best films of the year., unexpected but satisfying.<br /><br />Yes, this is a thinking person's sci fi and yes, you need to pay attention, but it isn't beyond comprehension.

B005H9B44A|3.0|The epic and complicated mythology connected with Thor, gets a major reworking in Thor (2011), one of the more intricate entries in the ever expanding Marvel movie universe.  A story about Thor inherently involves the duality of the mythological realm of Asgard and the Norse god universe, contrasted against the realm where the mortals of Earth exist.  Extensive special effects are employed to present a vision of this unique fantasy world, however the construct is not always understandable, or the characters particularly convincing.<br /><br />An uneasy peace exists between Asgard, led by their king Odin (Anthony Hopkins, [[ASIN:B000MGB6N2 The Silence of the Lambs]]), and the frost giants of Jotunheim.  After discovering their enemy in their midst, Thor (Chris Hemsworth, [[ASIN:B008G33O0G The Cabin In The Woods]]), his brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), and a group of warriors, journey to Jotunheim to do battle with the frost giants, with whom a tenuous peace exists.  After a skirmish, Odin intercedes and his sons escape alive, but with the peace now broken, Asgard may now be in danger.<br /><br />The character's origin gets a complete makeover, as Thor is banished to Earth by his father Odin where he meets astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, [[ASIN:B0041KKYEW Black Swan]]), and her scientific team.  Stripped of his powers, Thor is regarded as a handsome stranger, who speaks of strange things.  This ploy works in large part, due to a winning performance by Hemsworth, who bears some resemblance to a young Brad Pitt.  The real Thor was clean shaven, so Hemsworth's beard may seem out of place to purists, but after being mortal for much of the film, when Thor finally regains his hammer and his powers are restored, it is truly a glorious moment.<br /><br />With Loki plotting to take control, Thor's ultimate challenge lies back in Asgard, where special effects tend to take over.  It's a colorful, overdramatic affair, that concludes with some matters left hanging in the air, although Thor's availability for The Avengers (2012) is made abundantly clear.<br /><br />The godly nature of the character, makes Thor a challenge to capture in a movie, and the special effects are kind of up to par, as the vision isn't always very coherent.  The Dr. Donald Blake from the comics, who tries to keep a low profile, and taps his cane to transform into Thor, is nowhere to be found, as the movie has a completely different tone, and more youthful and modern spin, as Marvel Studios remains focused on the extremely profitable teen audience.  Hemsworth is a physically impressive and engaging Thor, but the story runs a bit long, and drags in several places.  Add in some scenes in Asgard that don't play very well, to some of the good moments on earth, and the overall result is an uneven, semi-entertaining film, that is recommended viewing to Prime members.e air, although Thor's availability for The Avengers (2012) is made abundantly clear.<br /><br />The godly nature of the character, makes Thor a challenge to capture in a movie, and the special effects are kind of up to par, as the vision isn't always very coherent.

0307744434|5.0|An old-as-time contest pits two illusionists against one another. Bound in a fight to the death, Celia, the daughter of a famous magician and Marco, the chosen prot&eacute;g&eacute; of a mastermind strategist are pegged against one another to each create their own brand of magic using a newly created circus as their platform. This circus is born of a few select talents under very secretive conditions. It exists only at night. With no clear understanding of the rules and especially the outcome, Celia and Marco embark on a torrent love affair. After two particularly upsetting tragedies occur, they slowly begin piecing together what the contest is really about and that everyone associated with the circus is inexplicably entwined in a game that breathes a life of its own. What has been set in motion so many years ago cannot be stopped and Celia and Marco must make the choice to succumb or fight to preserve what is theirs.<br /><br />This is one of the best novels I have ever read. I enjoyed it immensely and was sad when it ended. The prose is rich and lyrical, akin to the sound of a beautiful singing voice or the consumption of a truly satisfying meal. It is a feast for the senses in the form of written words and that in itself makes it a wonder. Morgenstern goes beyond even that however by offering a story so truly unique and captivating that I found myself playing out the scenes in my mind as I read, imagining what a real night circus would be like. Yes, this book is truly magical and dare I say, a real jumpstart to get the creative juices flowing.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This is one of those gems that is an extremely entertaining and interresting read, but also provides enough information for some self improvement.  While the author proclaims that this is not a 'self help' book, he does go into enough detail on how to actually improve your memory.  I've read the book twice - once for entertainment, and the second time for the techniques.  Either way, if you're looking for an interresting story and a good read, I highly recommend this book.  I read this book while on travel and couldn't put it down!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Boring as batsh.t.  Oh my goodness!  I thought it would never end and was so glad when it did.  I kept hoping it would improve.  There was zero plot; just sex, inane conversation, sex, inane emails, sex, etc etc etc.  I won't be buying the sequel.
0756697875|5.0|We have several of the DK Lego books and all are great. The batman one is no exception. Excellent photos and details about the various sets and figures. At 95 pages long it isn't lengthy but the pages are large and the illustrations detailed and brightly colored. There is a considerable amount of verbiage on each page too so if you have a young reader rest assured they aren't just getting a picture book. My 8 year old has spent at least a half hour per day with this book since getting it over two weeks ago and often longer than that.  Yes it is late September and his christmas list is done and on the fridge, filled with about half the sets in this book. I'm ok with that because I know he is actually reading it as well, as I have now heard every small factoid about every set since made since 2006.<br /><br />If you have a young person who likes Legos than you cannot go wrong with these books. All of ours have stood the test of time and Amazon usually has them priced extremely well.
0393080269|5.0|Ruchir Sharma (Head of Emerging Market Equities and Global Macro at Morgan Stanley Investment Management) has written an absolutely worth reading book; Breakout Nations - In Pursuit of the Next Economic Miracles. This book comes at an opportune moment when the world at large is looking at emerging markets for increased growth. Sharma very convincingly debunks many myths and takes the reader on a very interesting tour. The great thing about this book is that the author backs every argument with lots of captivating and logical data.<br /><br />The author has traveled extensively around the world and typically spends one week per month somewhere in the world and takes the reader from Lagos in Nigeria to Seoul in South Korea. This book is a vast collection of ground realities of more than two dozen countries Ruchir has minutely observed and the book absorbs the reader at almost every page. For e.g in the chapter on India, \\"The Great Indian Hope Trick\\", there is a fine piece on `High Context' and `Low Context' societies. Also, in the chapter `The Fourth World' he talks about Frontier Markets and mentions how Nollywood (Hollywood of Nigeria) with cheap technology and entrepreneurial spirit has become the second biggest employer in Nigeria.<br /><br />The key argument that the author makes in the book is that the past decade of extraordinary growth in the emerging markets is coming to end. He correctly points out that the growth in the emerging market countries came more from the global free money flows and less from domestic policies. He argues that going forward one cannot view emerging market countries as one group, but have to understand them as individual nations. For e.g. in the segment on Russia the author mentions that the outflow of private capital from Russia hit $80 billion in 2011 which was $42 billion in 2006, and that key things to watch out for Russia would be non-oil based growth and reversal of capital flows.<br /><br />The author right through the book offers various `Rules of the Road' to watch out for potential `Breakout Nations'. The author explains that the break-out game is all about beating growth expectations relative to one's per capita GDP level and in order to find the next breakout nations, one has to look at different wealth categories. According to the author, in the $20,000 - $25,000 income range Czech Republic and South Korea have a best chance. In $10,000 - $15,000 category Turkey and Poland could be potential winners. The author believes that Thailand could surprise on the upside in $5,000 - $10,000 income range. Under $5,000 Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Nigeria have a chance. According to the author India has a 50-50 chance to breakout.<br /><br />The author also presents in the book some innovative ways of looking at facts. One of the things he mentions is `The Billionaires Index' which means that if a country is generating too many billionaires relative to the size of the economy, the economy is not well balanced. The key thing is which sectors are generating billionaires and there has to be churn in the billionaires list. More billionaires generating from industries (Real Estate, Mining, Oil & Gas) where there is government patronage is a not a good sign. Sharma also touches upon developed countries such as USA and Germany and persuasively mentions that how USA will maintain leadership in technological innovations and will keep up the pace in the global growth game.<br /><br />Lastly, the author has an art for smart lines and some in the book are quite fascinating. For e.g. in the chapter on the global commodity mania, the author mentions that those countries (Brazil, South Africa etc.) that have solely depended on the growth in commodity prices are heading for a tough landing. In author's words \\"Meanwhile the nations that have reveled in the commodity boom are likely to face a disheartening return to the mundane ordeals of a normal life. Buddhist monks have a phrase for it: After the ecstasy, the laundry\\".<br />Breakout Nations is certainly worth reading!
B006LSZECO|4.0|References to Hitchcock are a bit of a stretch and had me looking for poetic justice throughout so i recommend putting those reviews aside while you're reading this but still get it.... This is a great book! It keeps you guessing and I have to admit, I guessed wrong quite a few times! The characters are very, very well developed deep into the cast.
0439023521|3.0|I originally balked at reading this book.  But once I accepted the premise, which was that kids were brought togeether to kill each other for everyone's entertainment, than I was all right with it.<br /><br />I was sort of disgusted by the whole thought, but the story was well written, the characters well defined and developed.  I wasted no time after the story, and went right to the second one.<br /><br />I think that the love story between Peeta and Katniss was a little far fetched.<br />Spoiler alert:  They both win the games.  Didn't happen any other year.  So we can have two star crossed lovers.  Sort of unoriginal of a story line

0545265355|3.0|As an adult who read this for a book club discussion, I had a hard time thinking of this as entertaining fiction. Guess I have read too many current memoirs of young children in third world countries fighting for the lives after watching their parents, siblings and friends tortured and their villages destroyed.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Unlike some people I do not feel jipped by this book whatsoever. Yes it does feel slower than previous installments but that is the beauty of it. The war has left the 7 kingdoms ravaged and here we get a story about those who are not or are unknowingly playing the Game of Thrones. To me its the behind the scenes of those who are unravelling and those whose purpose is taking shape. A piece of art!
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Ok, I bought this movie and it came on time and was packaged safely. Me and my fiance was super excited to watch this movie. We were about 1/4th into the movie when it started skipping on us. Was very disappointed with this purchace!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I would not interpret this film as a morality tale or a love story. The film is a metaphor of how superficial means of appeasement (\\"Hunger Games\\") might be applied to a society which had been divided and had broken down. It's impressive how well they filmed a bleak mining town of the future -- where the heroine Katniss lived. It reminded me some Soviet \\"dystopian fictions\\" of the 1920s and 1930s. The dystopian \\"future\\" where society held together by \\"bread and circuses\\" is reminiscent of Rome in decline -- yes -- but also of the Soviet Union on the 1930s where society \\"hanged together\\" by the Statin's \\"Show trials\\". But wait, is it possible in America? The possibility of civil breakdown is probably more real than we care to think. We do not need nuclear warfare to cause a breakdown. You take a large city like New York - its water supply comes from hundreds of miles away and any interruption of that, or food, or power, or cell phone, or computer networks for a period of time will cause probably breakdown of order. Our society is so fragile, so dependent on the interworking of things to provide us with the goods and services that you don't need nuclear warfare to fragment us anymore than the Romans needed it to cause their eventual downfall. I recommend this film.
034580404X|5.0|At first I didn't want to buy into the hype and I'm definitely not a woman who thought she would ever like the thought of another woman, let alone myselself, being \\"dominated\\" by some ego-maniacal man.  I received the books first as kindle editions via a friend of a friend who said after his wife read the first book he had the best sex of his life! Then he told me to tell my boyfriend \\"you're welcome!\\"  I wasn't sure about them, but my sister-in-laws both said they were well worth the read and there was a love story underneath it all.  I still wasn't sure.  So, one cloudy Friday evening I decided to stay in and read.  I threw my kindle down on my bed three times, yelling about how I would NEVER in my life let some MAN do anything like that to me or anyone I knew if I could help it...but I still wanted to see where it would go. After all, this is a story about two consenting adults.  I have never even read one of the Harlequin romance novels my Mom used to read when I was younger.  My friend and I would take them and scroll threw to find the sex scenes and read them and laugh and giggle until we were blue in the face, but never really readng the story. So this was all new territory for me in more ways than one!!  Wow!  That's all I could say for hours...Wow!  I think I began reading after dinner around 7:30pm, and the next thing I knew it was 1:45am Saturday morning!!!  I thought it best to finally go to bed, hopefully dreaming of Christian Grey...I woke the next morning to use the bathroom, still quite groggy and in need of more zzz's, but I decided against going back to bed and made some coffee so I could find out what happend next!  And so, at 12 o'clock noon on Saturday I finished the first book!  I forgot to download the other two books, and they weren't on my cloud, so I had to go all the way to my office (in my PJ's, no less!!) and get them, for fear of being without Christian and Anastasia the rest of the weekend!  Needless to say, I got absolutely nothing acomplished that weekend.  I think I may have showered once, I'm still not sure.  I didn't even pause to make dinner.  We just ordered take out all weekend so I didn't have to leave the confines of Seatle and Mr. Grey!  Once I finished all three books, I was left with such an emptiness, I thought my heart was breaking, literally!  WTF?  These were just some smutty books I was supposed to be reading for fun, right?  I got so wrapped up in their world, I really felt like it was all ok...the contract, the punishments, the rules, the authority he had over her...all of it and I wanted it! I wanted it all and MORE!  I bought the paperback set so I could proudly display them on my bookshelf.  Yes, I am a fan.  Yes, It made my loins ache. Yes, I purchased the soundtrack. Yes, I can't wait for the movies.  And Yes, I can't wait to see if there's a book 4!  Please do read them, not because I said so, but because you have come this far, and if you're this curious, you might as well read them...YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I delete most games within a day. I didn't delete this one. Slow but fun. A very good time waster.
006016848X|5.0|This is one of the most important books I have ever read. It succintly puts together the reasons why men (basically all men, in any culture) are different from women (all women); why this creates problems of communication in a couple; and what to do about it. I found it fascinating reading and illuminating for its insights. This is a summary table I have written based on the book (sorry it does not appear as a table here because no html is allowed by Amazon. I think it summarizes the main thrust of the argument Gray makes and is spelled out  in the video by Paul Dewandre (in French) Les hommes viennent de Mars, les femmes de Venus.<br /><br />Man:<br />1) values competence,<br />2) reasons in sequential mode,<br />3) wants to resolve a problem alone,<br />4) is rational,<br />5) needs trust,<br />6) needs appreciation<br />7) is like a dolphin, wants a fish when he gets something done<br /><br />Woman:<br />1) values relationship,<br />2) can do multi-tasking,<br />3) wants to talk about a problem,<br />4) is emotional,<br />5) needs attention,<br />6) needs understanding,<br />7) is like a garden, wants to be mantained every day no matter what.
0316226424|5.0|I am disappointed at how many bad reviews there were of this book. In part, I think, it was the huge publicity and drama of the series. With all great series, people can get into their own ideas about how the series can end, which can lead up to huge disappointments. Just look at the reviews on the Deathly Hollows for the Harry Potter series, which was one of the best books I ever read. For me, though, there were no let-downs.. Everything was a bit magical for me about how it all just fell perfectly into place-there were no hesitations, no thoughts that something wasn't right. I loved everything about where the story was going. I followed every word. In a mistake about which of the books of the series was first, I read Breaking Dawn first, then Eclipse, and then Twilight in two days. I have to disagree with everyone else about this, because Twilight was my least favorite, and Breaking Dawn I loved most.<br />Second, I have to disagree about the outrage at the sex scenes. I never had a problem with it. I was eleven when I first read this [yeah, yeah, I was young and all, but no one told me there would be sex] and I was NOT misled by the bruising sex, and the whole bloody, agonizing pregnancy. Real life and this story weren't linked in my mind. It was the difference between a vivid dream and waking hours. If anything, the book led me to appreciate the bond between mother and child-though at times, I did feel like slapping Bella for her utter disregard for self-preservation.<br />All in all, I loved this book. I'm sorry for the people who just couldn't make the leap. Maybe it has something to do with still being a child, when the Twilight series was like a portal to fairyland. If you're thinking about buying this book, don't pay too much attention to people with preconcieved ideas. If you loved New Moon and Eclipse, then this book is for you.
B000LXHK22|3.0|A feel good movie to take you to Provence for a couple of hours. Crowe is not at his best, whereas Marion Cotillard is the real star.<br /><br />The moral of the story is one I share: work to live, don't live to work. The setting (ruthless London city trader sees the light and a pretty woman and turns good) is a bit trite. But then again the point the movie is trying to make is a simple one. But a strong one.<br /><br />But this is also a movie about wine. You learn a bit about French wine making specifically, though American wines enter the fray when Max's cousin comes into the picture. A couple of references are made to the France-California rivalry: I would recommend watching the film \\"Bottle Shock\\" together with this one. This movie was made the same year as the rematch of the famous blind tasting challenge known as the Judgement of Paris, again won by California over France.<br /><br />The ending is predictable, sort of, but with a fun twist...
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Why is a review required to delete this from mhy kindle?  who cares what itbink oftbis book?    and more words are required?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I just don't see where all the hype is coming from with regards to divulging top-secret information. Heck, Tom Clancy novels have more details about some of our nations hardware/procedures then ever is mentioned in this book. This book helps to prove the theory that the more someone talks about something in a negative way in order to make people avoid reading a book only makes people go out and read the book in question. This was the case for me as I had read 3 or 4 SEAL related books in the weeks before the release of \\"No Easy Day\\" and was ready to move on to other topics but all the hype on the news made me decide to buy and read this book. Wow, I could not put the book down and read it in a day and half. I think the book is hard for some to swallow for two reasons; 1. The first book to deal with the OBL raid was written by an enlisted man and not an officer. 2. The author's book takes away some political capital from President Obama in an election year.<br /><br />I highly recommend giving this book a try or at least download the free sample if you are a kindle reader.
0525953728|5.0|This is a book you can't put away even if you are tired of reading. The author reveals a lot about special ops training without compromising any details that may be of concern to future missions. It just proves the value of all of our military personnel both in well known large operations and those secretive operations that are little or possibly never reported. I am a former Army NCO (1965-72) and I was totally blown away after learning of the extensive training and the capabilities the US has when these special units are in action. I am going to order several more copies as gifts for several of my friends.
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|He may be 71 years old with a bit of gravel in his voice, but this album is so fresh and innovative one would swear it to be the work of a young creative genius just preparing to leave his mark upon the world. \\"Tempest\\" has a fresh sound with instrumentation and arrangement unique on the music scene.<br /><br />Bravo! This album is a true gem.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I have read a couple of reviews that say this CD is a lot of flourish without true emotion or substance underlying it.  Well, I say fooey to that.<br /><br />When I heard Sigh No More for the first time, my reaction was that it was a solid CD but the rave reviewers must be drinking some Kool-Aid that I had not sampled.  Well, Babel is so much better than Sigh No More and to my mind puts Mumford solidly on top of the heap of all of the neo-roots bands playing today.  I could listen to this record over and over, and in fact I am.  They are so exuberant, it has me bouncing around in the car.  I love the formal, old-fashioned language, the revivalist fervor, and the sheer joy of music that these guys exude.  I love the quiet numbers just as much.  Their patent delight in playing together comes through in every note.  Highly recommended.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|I liked this movie when it came out and still like it in 2012. It's Robert Redford and Paul Newman at their best. Keeps you thinking and guessing until the end.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD were really great. The Blu-ray makes it look better than it probably did on the screen in 1973.<br /><br />The only weird thing with this movie is that it has Scott Joplin ragtime music, which I LOVE, but doesn't relate to the 1930's setting. (Not sure what they were thinking here.)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was amazing!  I couldn't put it down and I was completely absorbed in the adventure Pi Patel goes through.  Pi is an ordinary boy from India who is going to move to Canada with his family.  The ship sinks and he gets stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker.  It is an absolutely incredible story and I left it with a new perspective on life.

B00003CXI1|5.0|Under Chris Columbus' masterful direction, with an appropriate score by John Williams--the theme song being a creeping waltz that has that \\"once upon a time in a haunted castle\\" expression about it, the inaugural film of J.K. Rowling's beloved young wizard--vividly brought to life by the perfectly cast 11-year-old Daniel Radcliffe--takes flight.<br /> I fondly recall the initial photo of the trio of the film's young leads when they were first introduced to the world, and how everyone cooed over them. They did not fail to live up to expectations, and in fact surpassed them!<br /> The story begins one evening in the fictional English neighborhood of Little Whinging in the town of Surrey, where a wizened old wizard named Albus Dumbledore(the incomparable Richard Harris, fulfilling his granddaughter's wish that he play the role)uses a magical device called a deluminator to draw light from the area's streetlamps as he waits with anticipation an arrival of great significance. He pauses to acknowledge the presence of another professor of their school--the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry--named Minerva McGonagall (the equally incomparable Dame Maggie Smith)who transfigures from cat to human, and consults Dumbledore about a recent tragic event.<br />  Coming forth from catastrophy, bundled in the flying motorcycle of a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid(Robbie Coltrane)is a sleeping one-year-old infant with a jagged scar on his forehead, whom the three deposit on a residential doorstep despite McGonagall's misgivings.<br /> Ten years later, we find the young Harry Potter, an orphaned ward of his abusive and neglectful Aunt Petunia(Fiona Shaw), and Uncle Vernon Dursley( Richard Griffiths), and their spoiled, ill-bred son Dudley(Harry Melling)on Dudley's birthday. Relegated to a room in a cupboard under the stairs of his guardians' home on Privet Drive, as well as to cast-off and ill-fitting clothing, Harry is the servant of the family who prepares and serves the mealswhile Dudley has no responsibilities, all the priviledges, and mistreats his cousin, who has remained sweet, self effacing,polite, and unbroken, just as his parents do.<br /> But this boy's version of a Cinderella story begins to take an unusual turn when the family visit the zoo on Dudley's birthday, and Harry personally empathizes with the confinement of the zoo's boa constrictor, beginning to chat with the snake, who understands him, and mysteriously escapes from his glass enclosure, while, to Harry's amusement, Dudley ends up trapped in the enclosure.It is one of many moments when the crinkled bright-eyed beam of the tremulous and beautiful youngster lights up the screen.<br /> Shoved back into the cupboard as punishment for Dudley's humiliation after coming home,  Harry is soon deprived even of a mysterious piece of mail that arrives for him, when his uncle cruelly burns it in front of him.But even on Sunday, the letters keep coming as mysterious owls congregate on the Dursley's front lawn. Letters for Harry flood the house, and the Dursleys vainly attempt to evade them by fleeing to an island lighthouse.<br /> But Harry's call of destiny will not go unanswered.Hagrid confronts the Dursleys there on Harry's eleventh birthday, and the boy learns the truth about his background as a wizard, as well as the reasons why his aunt, who was jealous of her dead sister, could never love him.Gradually he learns the truth of his parents' death as well. For commandeering the birthday cake Hagrid brought for Harry, Hagrid gives Dudley a pig's tail.<br /> The journey towards a new life begins under Hagrid's supervision.Harry leaves with the formidable stranger who delivered him to the Dursleys as an infant, and the two travel to Diagon Alley, where they shop for Harry's school supplies, unlike any in the Muggle world. The go to Gringott's Bank where Harry learns of the vast wealth his parents left him.In a pub, Hagrid introduces the boy to many who know him and are glad to meet him, including the turbaned Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor Quirrel(Ian Hart), who will prove to be two-faced in more ways than one.<br /> After Mr. Ollivander( John Hurt) sells Harry a wand, Hagrid reveals why Harry is famous, and the details of his parents' deaths at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort, whose name wizards avoid speaking.<br /> Soon Hagrid leaves Harry, his luggage, including his new pet owl, Hedwig, at the King's Cross Train Station, emphasizing the importance of sticking to his ticket.Unable to get Muggle assistance in finding Platform 9 3/4,  a chance encounter with a family of redheads, namely the Weasleys, helps him transport through the barrier.Molly Weasley(Julie Walters) tells Harry her son Ron( 12-year old Rupert Grint),is a first-year student as well.Soon Harry celebrates his new life by entertaining his new friend, buying all the magical candy on the cart offered to them, which is enjoyed by Ron's rat Scabbers as well.An imperious young girl, assisting in the search for a missing frog comes by.She is the Muggle-born intellectual, Hermione Granger(10-year-old Emma Watson with a face full of baby fat),who critiques Ron's unsuccessful attempt at casting a spell, but is more impressed by Harry.<br /> Clad in robes and uniforms, the first-year students disembark, and are guided to the boats by Hagrid, which sail magically to the castle that is Hogwarts.<br /> Professor McGonagall leads the newcomers to the great hall. As they wait to enter, Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton), introduces himself to Harry, but fails to secure his friendship due to his slighting of Ron.The other fateful decison Harry faces is which of the four houses in which to be sorted: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Learning  that Voldemort was a Slytherin alumnus, and seeing Malfoy sorted in to that house, Harry successfully pleads with the Sorting Hat(Leslie Phillips) to placed anyhwhere but Slytherin, and he joins Hermione and the Weasleys in Gryffindor, where his parents were also placed.<br /> After dinner(during which John Cleese cameos as Gryffindor House Ghost, Nearly Headless Nick), the students are led amid paintings with moving figures, and changing staircases to their respective houses.While his roomates sleep, including Seamus Finnegan(Devon Murray), Neville Longbottom(Matthew Lewis, who found his  missing frog, Trevor), as well as Ron, Harry contemplates his new life,  the suddenness of  change, and of experiencing more wonders in a day than a boy's imagination can hold.<br /> Together, he and Ron face a reprimand for being late to McGonagall's class and witness her tranfiguration  in the process,they take flying lessons from Madame Hooch(Zoe Wanamaker), resulting in Harry's being placed on the Quidditch team as his father once was for an unexpected display of skill, and along with Hermione, have that now iconic moment of encountering a three-headed dog named Fluffy.<br />  Perturbed by Hermione's besting everyone in Flitwick's(Warwick Davis) Levitation class, Ron expresses his annoyance with Hermione. But when the three take on a mountain troll in the girl's bathroom in one hilarious scene, the friendship is permanently sealed.<br /> We will watch Harry develop as a wizard with the help of his knowledgable young friends, finding encouragement from other mentors including Quidditch captain, Oliver Ward (Sean Biggerstaff), under whose guidance he triumphs in his first match.<br /> The three wizard detectives will see Harry saved from Voldemort by the Centaur, Firenze(Ray Fearon) in the Forbidden Forest, and gain clues about the Sorcerer's stone, which they discover Fluffy to be guarding, its maker, the actual historical figure Nicholas Flamel, and what the mysterious Professor Severus Snape(Alan Rickman) is trying to do with it.Intellect counts greatly with these three, and it is moving to see the once neglected orphan find joy in the recipience of a Christmas present, albeit the unusual Invisibility Cloak, and to be in a place where he is better clad in beautifully vibrant and complimentary monochromatic knits, better fed, and cared for than he has been in ten years.An encounter with the Mirror of Eiresed gives him a chance to confront his longing for his dead parents.<br /> In addition to capturing the vibrant colors for which frequently rain soaked Britain is known,Director of Photography John Seal sharply flatters his beautiful young subjects, notably in one scene where the warmly clad hero walks across a snowy courtyard with his feathery friend and lets her fly into spring.<br /> In due time, Hagrid unintentionally drops enough clues about the Sorcerer's Stone, and how to get past Fluffy.The three are very much up to the challenge of preventing the stone's theft, although they have to get past Neville to do so.Using previously, as well as newly acquired skills, they work their way down until it is Harry who confronts the villian , and is made aware of the influence of Voldemort in a dangerous and dramatic encounter, after which Dumbledore explains to the boy how his mother's sacrificial love for him continues to protect him.Harry will now probably better endure his homelife because from here on in, he will spend most of his life in a place where although quite perilous,he is loved, admired,and validated.<br />  Despite some inconsistancies with the book,great justice has been done to Rowling's modern epic tale that will have everyone cheering for the young musketeers with wands, the triumph of courage and virtue, and for the scarlet and the gold for generations to come!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read the whole trilogy and while it was highly entertaining and a fast read, the author might not know the meaning of the word murmur. A dictionary and a thesaurus would be a great tool (gift her!) for her. This was just one example of her lack of creativity as far as word play. She succeeded in writing a soccer mom erotica book. If you want to read erotica, I suggest you do your research and find more worthwhile titles.

B0018LX9T4|4.0|I'm not sure I liked it but the performances were incredible. It's a bit heartbreaking even. There is S & M but it's not as Bettie Page as it sounds.
0545265355|5.0|The product came on time, it was in great condition and exactly as it said it would be. I bought it at a fairly low price, and love the trilogy.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great acting .... a show that brings out all emotions (laughter, hate, saddness, love) is<br />truely rare these days !!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I purchased this movie a few years ago when it came out. I watch it all the time. I don't care if it is a Christmas movie, it is a great movie. They have come so far with the way they do animation for movies now than when I was a kid. This is a must have for your Christmas movie collection.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book had me guessing and second guessing all the way through. Wham! What an ending! If you like legal thrillers, then read this one.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really liked this game & there didn't seem to be any bugs using it on my Kindle HD.  I probably played it 2 hours a day for 3 days so I feel I got my dollar's worth.  The plot was kinda blah but it kept me interested (I am not a zombie lover like a lot of people).  The puzzles were challenging enough but not too difficult to figure out with some thought.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is pretty fun. leaves a lot of room to expand play free. I would recommend to anyone who played zynga  games on facebsyntax.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was an easy read and a great romance.  I appreciate when the author does not drag on storylines, and that is exactly what Jamie McGuire did...she cut to the chase and wrote a very interesting love story.  You don't want to put this book down.  I loved both characters as well.  If you like Fifty Shades of Grey, this is a great followup without all of the sex.  This book has some sex but more story, which I loved!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Well done but still adolescent values. The film proves that there are no super heroes. The film's message is through metaphors.
B0068FZ1KA|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I ordered it, and it shipped within a couple of days. It arrived many days sooner than expected without a scratch on it. I highly recommend watching this movie!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its really good its  easy . i love the bible so much its so good to no whats in it
B0098VYCCE|1.0|This movie was, without a doubt, the worst movie I have seen in almost 20 years!  It was a complete and utter waste of time.  It took three days and three attempts to finish it.  I kept giving it a chance, hoping it would finally get better, but it just got worse.
0375507256|1.0|This book gains your interest, loses it, gains it again, loses it again, gains it again... guess what happens next.
B0058YPGSY|4.0|I'm hesitant to buy DVDs on line because they don't ship well. This one was fine though. Good series at a Good price.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest..this app is great! it has tons of need things to do and look at. I recomend for everyone
0452289963|5.0|This is my favourite book now!  If I had to go somewhere else and I could only take one item with me, this would be the one! If you follow what's written in this book you won't need a psychologist, neither any other book on personal growth!<br />I know it's not simple to switch your mind, it needs work, but if you are constant, it will really change your life.<br />I trully recommend it.
B008B11R1Q|1.0|I was excited about this new release.<br /><br />Sadly, the majority of it is a bunch of poseurish mumbly. It makes you want to find the band and kick their ass for moping so much about nothing. Go do some volunteer work or something productive in society, I wanted to scream at them.<br /><br />I really liked the first album.  I only like the graphic of this album, and maybe the song \\"Angel\\".  That is all.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It was a great app...until it woildnt let me download vids or songs.i was so sad so 3 stars for now
B0063GORYU|1.0|I find that the game is not accurate. When I move a column of cards it often goes to the open space next to it and not onto the column I indicated. This leads to a false count in the actual number of moves, which is not helpful when you are trying to break a record number of moves.
B005LAIHE0|2.0|This is the story of the trials and tribulations of a couple consisting of an American and an English woman. He is living his dream job and is about to be promoted, but he gives it all up when his fiance gets a job in cold Minnesota. He follows her as she follows her dream. So that pushes back the wedding. They have lots of good reasons for postponing their wedding, everything from moving, to injury and even a breakup. This is a painfully long, slow and dull movie. It has witty moments, but nothing that feels laugh out loud funny moments. More like amusing. The two main characters are to normal and or bland to be all that captivating for a romantic comedy that is longer than 2 hours. Thankfully they have a cast of quirky fun characters that make them look even blander.<br /><br />Please pass on this movie, you feel every minute of the 2+ hours.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a superb source of information. I enjoy every component. The games are fun and challenging. Each section offers many layers for indepth exploration. Can't say enough good things about the product.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I didn't like this as much as the first one, but I never tired of the relationship between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. I just couldn't seem to put it down - I had to know how it all ended!
0525953728|5.0|This book is very good. It doesn't have any type of secret information about our military. if that's what your looking for then this isn't for you. This book is about the Osman bin laden killing. and it does give detail about it. The way it starts out is kinda like when am i going to get to the raid but it builds you up to where you get a background on how brave these men are for what they do. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know about how brave these men and women are and how much they do for our country.
B000NQPZCO|4.0|I  love donnie brasco. One of the best mob movies. Only compalint is the Audio can be better on Blu-Ray. Video is very good.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have not finished the book because it is not to my taste.  It is poorly written and far too 'descriptive' than it needs to be.
072325804X|2.0|I was disappointed with such tales as 'Tale of Pigling Bland' and 'Tale of Samuel Whiskers'.  Whether to read the story, or even worse, the video(s), it is disturbing for a young one.  In the first story mentioned, a man captures Pigling Bland, and at one point ominously hovers over him, and pokes him, and says 'its not time in the season for curing bacon.'  Then in the latter story, it depicts a kitten being captured by rats, who wrap him in twine, and then wrap him in dough, all the while the kitten is mewing and writhing to get away. I really can't let my 2 1/2 year old watch this stuff! I am soooo disappointed. Such charming artwork and imagery!! I didn't know the Beatrix Potter stories had such a dark side.
0060837020|5.0|Read a library copy of Bell Jar and had to have it. It felt like I was side by side with her, all the way down. It seemed so clear what she was saying, it was spooky. Now I can re-read the book and notate on every page. Books I REALLY like I must write in. Feels like I know her. I always want to understand, or try to, the mental and emotional trials of struggling, highly intelligent individuals. Bell Jar is on the list, and not overwhelming. On the way to Infinite Jest.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing and cant wait to read the others. The movie better live up to this! I will be reading this again!
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|\\"But\\", I hear you say, \\"I read the synopsis. It IS about a guy who goes back in time to stop the Kennedy assassination!\\"<br />Yes it is. And the story behind the assassination is somewhat interesting, and the description of the life and times of the late 50's and early 60's - not an entirely rose-tinted one either - is quite fascinating.<br /><br />But that's not what it's about.<br /><br />If one measure of good fiction writing is the ability to make the reader invest in the characters, believe in them, care about them, then in my opinion King succeeds beyond anything else I've read recently... or possibly at all. Judging from some of the message board and forum postings that I've read since finishing the book, I'm not the only one who holds that opinion. In my view a measure of even better writing is the ability to resist the temptation to give the audience an easy ride, with the events and outcomes that they would like to see. Some unpleasant things happened to a number of the characters, things which made for uncomfortable moments for any readers who had come to care about them. In addition the story ending was not a \\"happily ever after\\" one but somewhat bittersweet... and somewhat open ended as well.<br /><br />But I repeat; the story is the characters, not the Kennedy assassination, not the alternative timelines, not the time travel. And not just the principal ones, but many of the minor ones as well. Several days after reading it they're still on my mind and again, from the aforementioned postings, I'm not the only one there either.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into specifics of who they are or what they do because I don't want to be responsible for spoiling the story for future readers. (Even though with a book this popular this review is likely to be buried on page 10 within 24 hours  and no-one will ever see it. The fact that I'm still taking the time to write it speaks of my opinion of the book.) You'd be far better off seeing for yourself.<br /><br />Idid find that parts of the story lines sagged a little (for me, it was the ones relating to the assassination plan) but in the end I really didn't care as it allowed me to spend perhaps a few more pages in the Land Of Ago with a group of people that I wanted to see more of.<br /><br />I'm not a Stephen King fan (horror is not my thing) and I would not normally give any book a five star rating since no book ever reaches perfection.<br /><br />(One of King's romantic scenes was nominated for the Bad Sex Writing award, and while I wouldn't have nominated it (If most people wrote honestly about their own erotic encounters, those would probably qualify for such an award as well since it's just the nature of the act) I will admit that one aspect of the scene stretched credibility a bit. I can't say what without giving away an important plot point but I'm not sure that \\"oh sugar\\" is quite that easy to achieve on someone's very first attempt at it. However in a novel that runs to hundreds of pages, quibbling over one or two paragraphs is very petty, in my view.)<br /><br />For me this book is probably as close to ideal as any writer is likely to get, so on this occasion I'll give it the full five.
B008OHV5C8|5.0|It was only a year or two ago that a good friend introduced me to The Bad Plus as something \\"I might like\\". I did.<br />Someone, somewhere will be able to categorize them, but until they do I'll refrain from attempting.<br />This particular album I bought as MP3s so that I could hear it immediately, and the only comment I can muster is: if you like any of their other albums, you'll like this even more. It has been playing on a loop for three consecutive work-days and has increased my productivity and personal happiness by some significant amount. Probably.<br />Regardless, I love it.
B007CM9AMI|5.0|At first listen I wasn't immediately drawn into this album.  Bruce tunes don't have the catchy beat and riffs of the latest pop songs that make you want to listen 10 times a day and then burn out on them.  But after a few times through, the refrains and then the depth of lyrics did start sticking with me and have grown on me more and more - We Take Care of Our Own, Wrecking Ball (particularly fun as someone who's been to the Meadowlands), Jack of All Trades, etc.  I'm not sure there's a Rosalita in the bunch.  It's more heavy than that with its commentary on our national condition. But several do seem to be future classics and ones that will be played for a long time to come.
0316228532|4.0|The problem (some) people are having with this work of fiction is that they don't seem to be able to separate J.K. Rowling from Harry Potter. This book would be well-received by any other author but Mrs. Rowling's fame stemming from the very popular children's series has impeded many a critical thought. Think outside of the walls of Hogwarts, people.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|I like everything Michael Connelly writes. I'm glad he is putting out singles. More writers should do that. I enjoyed the preview of his next novel.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This second book was a page turner till the very last page.  I'm not much of a \\"trilogy\\" reader, but, cannot wait to start the next book.  You really get lost in the book.<br />Just loved it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I cheat when I read mysteries; I can't lie. I'm one of those \\"reads the last page\\" readers - which is tough in an age of digital books.  So I read reviews and looked up spoilers (of which there weren't any tell-alls that I found), but I knew that LOTS of people really hated the ending of this book.<br /><br />I was prepared for that.<br /><br />When I got to the end, I understood why people hated the ending, but I wasn't one of them, actually. I thought both characters are pretty are awful people, and I don't care for them AT ALL, but I really liked how Flynn worked it all in and pulled together an ending I didn't anticipate. I'm still thinking about it, which, for me, is a marker of a great book - when the characters stay with you for days/ weeks after you've read it, teasing apart the strands of the story to investigate the deeper underlying themes. For that reason, I gotta give it five stars: I'm still unravelling themes and motifs and realities from Gone Girl.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its just like it was when we were kids but you don't waste your quarters!  Pointless, but addictive! I love it!
0439023483|4.0|I read the book because my daughter is a librarian and insisted. The idea of children killing children was not something I cared to read about. The book is so well written you don't want to put it down. I still think it is not for anyone under the age of 18. Who decides what is appropriate for children to read/ Just because it has children in it, does not mean it is suitable.

B003M98792|5.0|FOLKS, THIS IS SWORDS PLAY AT IT'S BEST BY A MASTER SWORDSMAN. Tomisaburô Wakayama was a true master samurai. His brother is famous for playing Zatoichi the Blind Swordsman. Shogun Assassin delivers on all levels and is considered by most to be one of the greatest displays of skills with a bladed weapon. This is not for the kiddies as blood spills everywhere and Tomisaburô Wakayama takes no prisoners as Lone Wolf and Cub on the road to hell. This movie is a combination of scenes taken from the five or six films showcasing this superb samurai. If you are a action fan you will love this movie. One thing is guaranteed, you will definitely not be bored. Made is the 60's, the fight scenes has stood the test of time and can stand against anything made today. I have been a fan of Shogun Assassin for 35 years now. Excellent job on the blu-ray. Cheers.
B007J2TMQ0|5.0|This is an interesting and thoughtful analysis of the 2nd world war, the events that led up to it, and the more or less simultaneous events that took place in different parts of the globe, starting with the 1930's.<br />Thus we are are treated to some of the thoughts going through Hitler's mind (as recorded by some of his government members and senior military, his views of Mussolini and Franco, and their thoughts about their place in the 'new world order'.<br />The Japanese invasion of China, the atrocities that occurred there, and the competition between the communists and the Nationalists; their relationship with the soviets is also explored.<br />I have only read about 15% of the book so far, but I am enjoying the fresh insights into a war which was taking place (and ended) before I was really aware of it.<br />I have read others of Beevor's books (no, I'm not truly a war buff - I do read lots of other non war books) and have always found him insightful and a good read.

1603420398|2.0|I bought this book in hopes that it would have patterns for motifs that could be combined and used in afghans. This book has many patterns, but not a whole lot of motifs that can be joined together. (Or, I suppose you COULD, they just wouldn't look nice.) If you plan on making something along those lines, I would recommend a book of granny squares or something along those lines.<br />That being said - a lot of the motifs in this book are creative and pretty. But again, if you plan on joining them, go with a different book.
B008MEM24S|5.0|when I purchest this game I thought it would be boring or not worth buying but I actually love it. its my most favorit of all games.
B0083SBMBM|4.0|The only way this movie could be better is if it was an adult film with gritty cinematography. Created as it is in the Marvel Style ( bright, clear, witty, sarcastic, comic-book-y ) this movie is fabulously entertaining. Now for the critique: the story makes little if no sense. It is just an excuse to have a big fight in Manhattan. I actually pity the poor screenwriters; they have to take the Marvel Universe, excerpt parts of it, and weave together a story with certain characters. This seems like an impossible task. It is surprising that the film holds together at all. There is also the problem of showing real damaged bodies. There must have been horrible dismemberment and wounding of people, but none of it is shown. There is also the problem of the heroes; we have a group made up of a God, a man in an armored super-suit, a super-enhanced soldier man, an indestructible hulk, a regular woman who can fight well, and a regular man who can shoot nifty arrows. If there was any reality in this movie, the God, the iron man, and the hulk MIGHT be able to fight. The Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Cap would have been killed almost instantly; but it's a comic-book movie... anything can happen. I admit that the digitally-designed SHIELD facilities and heli-carrier look fabulous and almost believable... not too enormously complex. Some of the sequences in this film work very well; probably the best is when the Hulk thrashes Loki around like a rag doll... very satisfying. The movie does have a bit of a problem with continuity. There are lulls that go on too long, and a sort of a part 1 and part 2 to the action... but it does all come together nicely. we adults who watch it realize that in any remotely realistic universe the only ones who would have survived would be the Hulk and Thor, and why in tarnation didn't anyone think of shooting some nukes up into that portal in the first place. And I always like the little afterthought-endings that Marvel tacks on, to entice us towards the next development. This time we get the inference that the bad guys have to answer to another more powerful alien ruler, who we only see briefly as he turns his head. I got the impression somehow even before he turned his head that it was the Super Skrull. Thanks to obsessive people avidly reading reviews, I now know that the character is someone named Thanos, whom I very vaguely recall from reading Marvel comics 30 years or so ago. I have no idea what he does or where he fits in, but obviously, it's easy to find out nowadays. One last thought, I just watched a few bits and pieces again of the movie, a day later. It is even better than I thought. The set designs, the dialogue, the witty banter, the costumes... it is breathtaking.xt development.

B0088RQ4X4|2.0|I was not crazy about this movie, although it had some good parts.  And then it seemed at the end they weren't sure how to end  the movie that to me the ending didn't make sense and if it did I was so tired and just wanted it to hurry up and be over. It was extremely long...Just glad I didn't go to the movies and see it.

Gandhi was a man of virtue and loved everyone, and believed everyone should do the same.<br />Gandhi begins in a public scene where a man with an evil look on his face approaches and shoots Gandhi three times and kills him. Gandhi's death was a tragic event and thousands of people mourned over him. The film flashes back to a scene where Gandhi is an attorney and he is riding a train and because of his status they try to make him ride third class when he had a first class ticket. He refuses and is thrown off the train. Gandhi takes these attempts of discrimination as inspiration to his cause Gandhi does not give up any time soon. He encourages people to burn passes in defiance of the law, and Gandhi is then beat by police. Gandhi gives a speech to a packed hall calling for non-violent actions against the passed laws. Next, Gandhi calls for a miners strike and is soon imprisoned with thousands of other protestors and the mines still remain closed. General Smuts creates a deal with Gandhi and protestors are freed. Gandhi is jailed repeatedly and grows frustrated with the violence he witnesses. He decides to go on a hunger strike when he hears about a mass murder in India. Chinese and East Asian gunmen shoot and kill thousands of Indian children and mothers; the scene shown by the producer shows the cruelness of the leaders in these countries. This event and the sadness of Gandhi creates a turning point in the film. Gandhi tries to show the importance of non-violent actions and how powerful they really can be. Gandhi finds a away to be meaningful and get his point across in a away that isnot forcing anything on anyone. The Hindu people are a very religiously tolerant group of individuals and that usually why people are so drawn to Hinduism. Gandhi is a perfect example of perfect peace and he idea of been completely drawn to uniting with his lord.

B0098VYCCE|1.0|Ugh, this movie was disappointing to me! I was waiting the whole time for something to really hit me, and nothing did.<br />Don't pay to see this movie. Anyone who tells you that Stewart was amazing in this movie, has a very odd definition of, \\"amazing.\\" She had about 15-20 lines, not including the speech. There wasn't much acting required on her part and it's so blatantly obvious that it seems intentional.

0316228532|1.0|This is not an adult novel, this is just an adult trying to be crass, vile, and bring sex/exploits/etc. into a horrible plot and storyline. I never did like her writing style for the Harry Potter books, but I thought hey - she is only writing to kids (specifically) so do not get held up on the childish grammar and writing skills, but this continues to show that she really is not a good author. Period.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Note: There may be some SPOILERS here according to some commentors<br /><br />Difficult to believe that this series is able to maintain a high level of good writing and ideas and character development on such a morbid theme as Dexter, but here we are with season 7's first episode - and we're off an running, literally.  The opening of the season picks up where season 6 ended - same room, with Dexter just having murdered Travis - while his sister Debra (now a lieutenant in the police force) watching. Dexter tells her \\"I snapped,\\" blaming Rita's death. She asks about him being wrapped in plastic and he says it is just \\"second nature not to leave a trace.\\" When Debra tries to call the station he stops her, pointing out how weird everything looks. He points out that even if it is ruled self-defense he'd lose his job and his son. He suggests getting rid of the body, but she doesn't go for it. Dexter then thinks they could make it look like a suicide, including setting the church on fire. The plan involves gasoline and Debra says she'll go get a few gallons. Dexter flashes back to childhood and Harry wanting to get rid of a dog that Debra likes. Dexter thinks he needs to keep Debra from the \\"whole truth.\\" Dexter takes down all of his kill stuff. Dexter is forced to attempt a cover-up, which works for a while until Debra uncovers enough evidence to as Dexter is he is indeed a serial killer.  It looks as though the season will play on this strange predicament with every episode, but meanwhile there is an added murder with grand implications that sets the team, including Dexter, into action to uncover the killer.  The entire cast returns for this season - Michael C. Hall as the blood spatter expert Dexter Morgan, Jennifer Carpenter as Debra Morgan, C.S. Lee as Vince Masuka, Lauren V&eacute;lez as Lt. Maria LaGuerta, David Zayas as Angel Batista, James Remar as Harry Morgan and Desmond Harrington as Joey Quinn.  Grady Harp, October 12
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is a real page turner (even if that doesn't 'literally' apply to a Kindle product).

It's a great story that you can<br />get through in just a couple of sittings, much like some of the better John Grisham books.

0525953728|5.0|As a lady and Christian musician and singer, I was apprehensive about reading \\"No Easy Day\\" in thinking it would be a book mostly for tough men, with possible crude and vulgar language.  But to my surprise, there were only a few \\"manly\\" words that were no worse than what we heard from one of our \\"leaders.\\"<br /><br />I sat down in a book store to skim only few pages, but it was such a compelling book that I couldn't put it down and read the entire last half of the book. It is an excellent read and moments that were breathtaking!<br /><br />The true story about the night Osama bin Laden was captured and eliminated needed to be told; and who better to tell that story than Mark Owen on behalf of the Navy SEALS who spent a decade trying to find a very evil man who was responsible for the death of thousands of Americans.  President Bush and his administration<br />also deserve a lot of credit for the initial strategy in finding Osama bin Laden and wish it could have happened during his presidency.<br /><br />I would like to personally thank Mark for making the decision to break his usual code of silence to reveal the facts about this historical moment for the sake of U. S. History. The only thing missing was a photograph of UBL; that the American public has wanted to see since the night it was announced he had been killed.  But, it is understandable that Mark could not have released a photograph of bin Laden without the consent of the White House -- and that obviously is not going to happen. However, the world saw Saddam Hussein coming out of his filthy rat hole and later hung!<br /><br />Thank you, Mark, for writing a book that was appropriate for both men and women.  I highly recommend it for any adult. May God bless you and all of the Navy SEALS who risk your life every single day to keep America safe.  It is very sad that your identity and safety were not considered with the same respect.  Take care!

This is wonderful music!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is incredible. You can upgrade vehicles. Unlock amazing gadgets. Gain money. Level up. Style your player. Unlock achievements. The best part of the game is that it is free or I wouldn't have got it. You can pay for the game to get extra cash, but in my opinion it is better to just earn the game money through going past different sectors and collect it on the way. I had no trouble downloading it yet, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to update if a new update comes out. So far there has been no trouble with the game, so I'll give it a good 5*.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book presents an easy read on the background of an \\"elite\\" Navy Seal who was part of the team that \\"got\\" Bin Laden. If his account can be fully believed- and it has never been vetted by anyone else so who knows?- the good guys won, the bad guy lost and it was a little hairier than the popular press and our government let on. The picture in paints if of a group of loners (I'm retired Navy and have known a few Seals) who perform a very valuable service to this country, but aren't necessarily guys the average American could relate to very easily. It also clearly shows the author's disdain for traditional authority, whether it be his Navy superiors or the \\"clueless\\" politicans. He lives in a world where moment to moment decisions are life or death but the larger understanding of their ramifications in this country or the world seem lost on him and his peers. Were it only as clear cut and easy to make the big decisions as he seems to believe.<br /><br />Others can decide if he is a \\"hero\\" or not. I had very mixed feelings even buying this book, as I don't think someone in his capacity should have betrayed one of their most basic tenants to keep their operations secret. The fact he avoided getting permission or review of the story leaves me less than satisfied in the author or the absolute veracity of his account.

0547258305|3.0|3.5 Stars. When I started reading this book, I love it. It had action, fantasy and mystery. It's set in a medieval like setting and had a fairly original concept dealing with its \\"graced\\" characters, or characters with special enhanced abilities. But, as it went on I felt like it was two stories that got mashed together, and by the end I had lost interest and stopped caring about the characters.<br /><br />In the beginning when Po came into the story he was Katsa's match, they were both graced and both perfect for one another - equals in strength and skill. Their relationship started out so wonderful. It had spark, and snark, and chemistry. But then I felt like they became friends too quickly and that spark turned amicable, and I found this a little boring. Conflict was later introduced again, but I wish that there had been more of it between them throughout. I also loved when Po told Katsa that he'd give himself to her however she would take him, but then I was disappointed that it took so little time for them to hook up. The suspense had little time to build and then was lost completely. By the time I got halfway through this book I felt like any piece of the plot that revolved around Katsa and Po was resolved and thus there was little reason to continue on.<br /><br />Part of this book is a love story between Kasta and Po, and the other part is a fantasy quest with Katsa and Bitterblue. I feel like I would have liked it better had it been one or the other, especially because the angst and sexual tension that were building between Kasta and Po at the beginning was entertaining. But, it wasn't completely fleshed out and was resolved far too quickly. It left me wanting and feeling like the second half of the book was restarting with a new story that slowed things down because it was completely different from how it started. After the halfway point of this novel I felt like almost all of the questions I had, all of the mystery, had been resolved and then for the next 30% of the book things slowed down as you see some really awesome locations, but many of them we only get to see as Katsa is moving through them where there's little action. It was nothing more that Cashore telling us about this awesome world she created- which it is, but I could have done without that. The second half of the book lost the story for me.<br /><br />In the second half this book becomes more of a quest and the characters change, but not in a way I liked. The relationship between Katsa and Po that I felt was even matched turned into Katsa being stronger than Po. She also held all control in their relationship telling Po that she may just leave one day. I understood her need for freedom, but healthy relationships should involve compromise and commitment which this lacked. It felt just a little to radically feminist as if Cashore was trying to make the point that women are better than men.<br /><br />I'm all for strong female characters and I understood why Katsa was how she was, but there were parts of her personality that I had trouble relating with. I hated that she cut her hair off. I understand that it was practical, but this just bothered me. Kasta may not be a girly girl, but her hatred of wearing dresses, cutting off her hair, dislike of marriage and really anything considered a traditional female role, made it hard to find softness in her. I can understand her not wanting to get married, but she often looked at marriage as extremely oppressive of women and in a very negative light. To her being married meant to be a possession, and it made me feel like her opinion was rather biased. I felt too much like Cashore was trying to make a point with Katsa and that her character lacked some development because of it. I will say, Katsa's relationships with the men around her, particularly Po helped make her feel real, but I felt like they were somewhat glossed over and rushed through.<br /><br />There is a definite theme of wanting to protect young girlsfrom being forced to do something against their will. Cashore looks at power and control and how these things change who we are. This theme is repeated with the king's daughters who Randa sends Katsa to force one of which to marry, with Katsa herself and dealing with Randa's control, with the servant girl in the tavern, and then of course with Bitterblue and Katsa's dealing with Leck in the end. I didn't mind the theme, but I felt that it was a little strong.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed Katsa and Po's reunion but the few questions I had left such as, what did Leck want with Bitterblue, and why were there cut up animals and children dying, were still unanswered. I get that there's another book and guess that this will be answered then, but all my other questions were answered before I was even halfway finished with this book. So, this was the only question that kept me reading, and then not having it answered left me feeling frustrated.<br /><br />Overall, I think there is an audience for this book but I'm not it. If you like that stronger, feminist, `women are better than men' kind of characters you will relate to Katsa, but I didn't. Also, if you like books about quests and don't need the suspense of romance to carry you through a novel, you might enjoy the second half of this book more than me.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's boring, repetitive, cheesy, badly written, badly edited and a little offensive. The characters aren't interesting and the sex is reeeeaaallllly  awkward, mostly because she keeps talking to herself. She has these two subconscious personas that remind me of the Lizzy McGuire cartoon at the bottom of the screen. It doesn't help that she describes sex as if she is a 12 year old. I'm not into that and it's really disturbing. If she wasn't introduced as a 22 year old I wouldn't have guessed she was past puberty.<br /><br />But if you really have to read it, think of professor Farnsworth's voice (from Futurama) whenever she says \\"Oh my\\" or he says \\"oh baby\\". I guarantee it will make the book 10 times more interesting.<br /><br />I'm a glutton for punishment so I read 1/3 of the second one...it doesn't get better, so I stopped. Don't waste your time.
0316228532|4.0|This is nothing like Harry Potter.  Okay, I knew that, but deep down I was envisioning some of the ... magic in the world of Harry Potter would be evident here - but this is truly an adult book where honesty is more valuable than beauty.  It's real life, and it's harsh.  It was a little difficult to get into because of the vast array of characters who interact against the backdrop of the parish council election.  And J.K. Rowling takes her time masterfully shaping and delineating each character, creating a characteristically intricately plotted story which weaves the lives of at least twenty people into a varied, lively tale of the every day.  This novel is like a soap opera full of drama, petty jealousies, sex, drugs, abuse and adolescent rage.  Every private thought is revealed to the reader through the omniscient narrator making every failing of each character clear.<br /><br />At the heart of the political debate behind the election is the clashing lifestyles of the middle class and the very poor.  It's a look into where the line is drawn between handouts and civic duty to your fellow man.  How much care we should give to our neighbors, and when must we expect them to take care of themselves.  There is no easy answer and there is not one provided in this book.  This book just looks at the people who suffer under the system and it seems like it's everybody.<br /><br />This is a challenging and thought-provoking book, heavily dependent on realistically-portrayed characters and real-life issues.  It is tragic and darkly humorous, but not without some hope and charm.  Some of the characters are pompous and self-aggrandizing, wrapped up in their own small world-views, and the hope stems mostly from the younger characters who are not yet completely corrupted.  And yet for some it is too late.  There is so much in this book that makes you think about life at every stage, and though it didn't touch me on a deep emotional level, I admire it very much as a tremendous work of art.of art.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Horrifying dreadful.  Badly written, and as a devotee of the lifestyle, it is truly horrifying that this book has become successful. It does not depict, in any way the truth of the romantic, nurturing and promise of a D/s relationship.  In fact, it does just the opposite and it is most upsetting that it has become so successful.
B008S80P38|5.0|\\"Album title goes here\\" was just delivered today and i absolutely love it with the exception of \\"Failbait\\", that song is stupid, but besides that the album is great, delivered in perfect condition and a plus is that the album cover is holographic! which was a nice surprise
B0031RAOVY|4.0|It was in the last scene of the film that I realized just how good the film is. I couldn't move. I was so taken aback and stuck by a strange feeling of pain in my heart. Richard Gere finds a dog on the road and after numerous attempts at finding it a home finally decides to keep it. His wife is not a dog person so he doesn't know how to convince her but eventually...<br /><br />What really moved me about this film the most was - how complicated we make our lives and how much happiness can be derived from the simplest and noble most of things. This film is about a small community of regular people who care about one another despite being disconnected. Living in the city one tends to cherish little things like being part of such a system of community, unobtrusive and friendly.<br /><br />Wonderful film. I would recommend it again and again.
1451648537|5.0|I don't typically read biographies. I don't really read non-fiction unless it is about triathlon or fitness. I have wanted to read this book for quite some time now and finally decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I started reading last week. I became so intrigued by this man that I had to do read this entire book this weekend. I was not able to focus on anything else and when I was not reading I was not motivated to do anything but find a way to read more. I have not been this way about a book in a long time. Actually, I should say I have not been this way about a person in a long time.<br /><br />I found the story of Steve to be fascinating. I am not going to evaluate him in terms of a person because who am I to judge? We will never fully understand another person and simply reading a book does not give me \\"Expert\\" level knowledge on a person. I have a hard time knowing who I am most days.<br /><br />With that being said, I believe that there is much that can be learned from his life. There are all sorts of thoughts out there about trying to copy him to be successful like he was and other thoughts about doing the opposite because he was so ruthless. In the end we can only be ourselves. I think that is the important take away from it all.<br /><br />One quote that stood out to me in the book was<br /><br />\\"We probably only have the opportunity to do a few things really great and do them well.\\"<br /><br />This is what I am going to take away from his life. There simply is not enough time in the day or in our lives to do all things we want to do and do them well. Instead we must focus on what is really important to us whether that is family, job, inventing new ideas, art, etc. Steve did just that. He poured his life into his ideas and would stop at nothing to see them come to life. This desire has to have a balance and therefore other things suffered in his life along the way.<br /><br />This was a great story that allowed the public to get a glimpse about what goes on in the business world, in the mind of creative people, and to a world (Apple) that was so closed off until the unveiling of a product.<br /><br />I highly recommend this read. IT gave me plenty of ideas to think about and allowed to take away some key thoughts that I can apply to myself and my life. This is a well written biography.on in the business world, in the mind of creative people, and to a world (Apple) that was so closed off until the unveiling of a product.<br /><br />I highly recommend this read.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't usually go for this kind of crime, thriller books but I must say I'm really glad I bought this one. Gone Girl kept me wanting to know what was going to happen. I enjoyed that even at the end of the book the author could pull off another plot twist. If I have to say what I most cherished about reading this novel, I would say that it's the fact that the book's everything BUT predictable. READ THIS!! You'll be hooked.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|It would be nice if we could continue devotions without having to connect to the Internet.  they've steadily gotten more devotionals which has been nice.  I can't remember,  but I think you have to be connected to the Internet to make notes.  it would be nice if you could split screen between notes and Bible or devotional.

B008PZ69T8|1.0|To say that Fifty Shades of Grey is a good book is an out and out lie.  To say that this album of music that EMI has so kindly released to accompany the book is stooping to the lowest level of pandering is outright truth.  Firstly, it is quite clear that the author wouldn't know decent classical music if it smacked her in the head with a baseball bat. Canon in D? The slow bit from Rachmaninov's 2nd Concerto?  Hell she should have just mentioned Fur Elise and what is already a horrid, horrid compilation would have been made into quite possibly the worst travesty of a recording imaginable.  Had she any idea on what good classical music is, this album would have been intriguingly different and just *might* redeemed the content to a slightly lesser level.  Secondly, EMI chose some of the worst recordings of already poor music - Riccardo Muti is about as far from sex and passion as one can possibly get. Seriously the man has hardly ever shown a measure of passion in anything he's ever conducted in his distressingly long career.  How he continues to manage landing top orchestral jobs is completely beyond me.  This is but one example of the very poor chances made for this album.  Thirdly, and what distresses me more than anything, is the fact that EMI, a label that has a very long repuatation of recording great artists (such as Otto Klemperer, Herbert von Karajan, etc) would bring themselves to sell this schlock.  Is it really that bad that hey have to attach their name to rot and garbage?  A pity EMI, a pity.  Also, I doubt anyone who has read this book is even smart enough to wrap their head around this music anyway.  Oh well, garbage begets garbage.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I think the title speaks for itself. the game is really bad. all you do is place coins and hope something falls off a table. its worse than chucky cheese!

B002PZ1H6E|5.0|I have this movie on DVD and liked it so much that I downloaded it to my Kindle.  It's a powerful coming of age movie with a special kind of wit and a beautiful love story.  This story is filled with passion, tragedy, overcoming of obstacles and leaves you with a beautiful feeling when you are done.
B00881VLCE|4.0|the game is ok. nothing too special, it passes the time. its a bit simple but cute. it would be nice to have more detailed pictures
B007L5LD9O|5.0|This is a great version of the book.  Lots of dry humor and beautiful scenery.  Being a Jane Austin fan, I'm rather picky about the remakes of her stories; this did not disappoint at all.  Rent It - Buy It - See It, however you do it this is worth the cost.  I have this one, Sense and Sensibility, and Pride and Prejudice downloaded to my Kindle so that I have pleasurable entertainment with me at all times.  Great when traveling (especially when flying).  Hope this helps, enjoy!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|The blu ray came quick. The description stated that it was semi used but when i got it, it looked brand new, great price for an Awsome movie
0451169514|4.0|This one is hard for me to rate. I feel that if I would have read this book when I was younger (late teens maybe) I would have probably had nightmares for a long time. After reading it now though it didn't do much to scare me. I think I also had very high expectations for this book as well. Horror is such a wide diverse area. What scares one may not scare the other. So this is just my review on what this book did for me. I know others who have read it and never were the same afterwards. Same goes for the movie made based on the book.<br />As for my likes... my favorite part of the book are the characters and their wonderful friendship. I really enjoyed reading their moments together. It brought back memories of my childhood. Also IT was creepy! Some of the scenes involving IT had me cringing.<br />Dislikes... book was too long. I have read large books and have been totally entertained the whole way through but with this one I felt dragged in many places. I really think it could have been condensed and ended up being a much better book. The ended was a bit too far fetched for my tastes. The idea of where IT came from just made it less scary for me.<br />All in all it was a good book and I'm glad I read it. Even though it didn't terrify me, it might terrify you. Think it should be a definite read for horror fans.
B007SSEU9O|3.0|One of the best movies I've seen. I've recommended it to everyone I know. One brief split second of a bare-breasted girl was the one downer for me - totally unnecessary and had nothing whatever to do with the movie-why do they always do that?
B008O69SZ0|4.0|A very good album of songs from someone who's been around for quite a long time.  Recommended for someone with matured taste for classic type music.
B0046JT796|5.0|I've always liked everything about this album. I figured my over 40 year old stereo Lp of \\"Highway 61 Revisted\\" might have seen better days so I purchased the new 2010 mono remaster and am very glad I did. The stereo Lp always seemed to lack the bass and be rather shrill in places, but the sound on the Mono Version is very warm and well rounded to my ears! After several days listening to it, I do prefer the new mono remaster to the old stereo Lp version.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|I picked this up a couple of months ago.  My 7 year old son has a big/bad Lego habit and I thought it would be fun to channel that addiction into something we could all do together as a family.<br /><br />I was not disappointed, the whole family loves this game.<br />The idea is to select a card with a picture on it, then build that object out of Lego and get the other people playing to guess what it is.  Just like Pictionary but you are building the \\"picture\\" not drawing it.<br /><br />I like the way you can choose the difficulty of your task when it's your turn by selecting a level 1, level 2 or level 3 card.<br />My son definitely had an advantage because he was well acquainted with the way all of the little hinged Lego blocks go together but he was helpful in helping us find what we were looking for if we asked him.<br /><br />We are always modifying games to make them work for our whole family.  We didn't like the container that came with the game to hold the pieces so we dumped out all the pieces onto a cookie sheet so we could see what was there to work with more easily.  I think that was helpful.  We also don't necessarily follow the rule book when we play, we don't play for points, we just play for fun and take turns guessing what the object is.<br /><br />This game requires some thought, some effort and some imagination.  Sometimes the pieces you wish you had to build something aren't included in the pool to draw from so you have to improvise and do the best you can with what is available (kind of like life, right?).  Sometimes the pieces aren't the right color...maybe everyone will guess and guess and then need a hint or a little help by having the builder hold the object a certain way or move the object a certain way.  Sometimes the littlest builders will dust their elders in both guessing and building.<br /><br />If you do not have an imagination, if you do not know how to problem solve or think out of the box don't bother wasting your time or money with this game.  If you like a fun family game that can be challenging for a variety of skill levels, requires imagination and problem solving and is fun for young and old alike you will love this.h this game.

B0063HBPH6|5.0|I have read this book at least twice a year since I bought my first paper copy in 1996. I have owned at some point several of the fan copies so deftly described in the preface on this book i.e. held together with tape, dropped in the bath, and 'borrowed' and never returned.<br /><br />Traps for new readers, do not go looking for a Douglas Adams `style' book, this book is not written by Douglas Adams. Do not go looking for Neil Gaimen style of book, he is only responsible for part of it. Do not go looking for a Terry Pratchett style of book, he is only responsible for part of it. However, If you are a fan of Gaiman or Pratchett you will find echoes of their early work in this book.<br /><br />I first picked up this book never having heard of either Neil Gaimen or Terry Pratchett. I would not say that I'm a huge fan of either of these writers. I find both of their styles to be very hit and miss. I do nonetheless truly adore this book.
0061122416|5.0|This book is amazing, captivating and inspiring. Every one should do what they love and follow their dreams. Truly an amazing book, Paulo Coelho is brilliant author i recommend this book to any one.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I was able to find this at a small hardware store locally for about what amazon was charging.  I got it out of the package and tested it out on my old trusty HRT knife.  I was concerned to see actual metal filings coming off of the knife as I've had it for more than 12 years.  With only a few swipes, the edge is sharper than I've been able to get it in years.  I used to spike to touch up an old hatchet.  Did just fine.  Great last minute add for my next backpacking trip.
0312330529|5.0|This novel, Shantaram, was purchased through Amazon. It is one of the best written and most intriguing books I have read in a long time. I am an avid reader and have recommended the purchase of this book to all of my friends. It is a long book and  you'll want to enjoy every minute of it. It is a book that I will read again just for the pleasure of reading such fine writing. I have been a writer for over 40 years and I find it difficult to find another author (Grwegory David Roberts) who can capture my imagination and give me visuals like he does. The book flows so smoothly and you'll just never want it to end.<br />Marilyee Dowling

0316228532|5.0|I woke up at 2:30am, BING, and finished reading this book. I really enjoyed it, although it's not flawless and gets a little S.P.E.W. in places. This was exactly what I wanted to read, a kind of modern day Dickens/Austen thing. The characters were so engrossing, even the characters I have nothing in common with - Gavin, Samantha, Kay, Cubby. I'm going to miss them. Jo, you've done it again!<br /><br />And gosh, some of her turns of phrases were brilliant.
B005LN5UOC|5.0|I've never had an ear piece before and i really didn't want to pay for an expensive one. i saw this gio-tech and read up on it. it came in the box perfect, and was ready to go. Syncing it to my ps3 was easy and quick. i use it now to play COD and Borderlands and it has really helped my game play and being connected with my friends. mind it that it doesn't have the sound like a turtle beach but since i don't use it just for COD, it was a win/win for everything. my wallet didn't suffer, my gaming increased, and I'm far better off now. highly recommended for someone who isn't looking to spend alot but still wants a high quality ear piece.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Entertaining in all ways.  Lots of action for testosterone junkies, romance for the girlfriends/spouses, and even some funny lines.  Am ready for the next movie in this series.
0316067598|5.0|The story of Operation Redwing is an incredibly sad and heroic event that I believe every American should read!  The \\"Rules Of Engagement\\" puts our military in a position of \\"Hesitation\\" where the difference between survival/success of a mission and death are split second decisions!  Unfortunately this has and still is costing lives!  Our Navy Seals are the top of the pinnacle and are trained to do a job, do a job well, and do a job with only the required casualties.  Sending these Seals into an intense situation with basically,  One Hand Tied Behind Their Back, makes me sad that this is what our country has become.  My opinion .......... Go Seals!  Do what needs done, no more, no less!!!!!!!  And most importantly \\"THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE!\\"<br />10-1-2012
B008QE9XD2|2.0|Be very aware that there is alot of Vampire fans out there, and a lot of Johnny Depp fans, and seeing Johnny Depp as a vampire is a wet dream for those kind of fans. So expect to see a lot of 5 star reviews that would give the movie top scores on the mere fact that such and such have been put together for the first time. I on the other hand am no fan of Vampire movies, especially ones that sparkle, nor is Johnny Depp a favored actor of mine: so let me be brutally honest when I tell you this movie is really getting overrated reviews from women who just enjoyed seeing one actor of the world play a role that is being done to death lately.<br /><br />The plot is about a wealthy and respected guy (Johnny Depp) who wouldn't fall in love with a witch. So the witch casts a spell on the guys girlfriend to throw herself off of a cliff. The guy plummets after her, only to find the witch has cursed him to be a vampire. The witch then exposes him as a vampire and the town go after him with pitchforks and torches to bury him in the ground forever. 100 or so years later, his coffin is dug up and he returns to his mansion to find his decedents are living there. He introduces himself, but only the mother of the clan, played by Michelle Pheiffer, understands that he is actually the vampire guy who he says he is.<br /><br />The vampire then ends up living with the family and some almost humorous moments take place as the vampire meets and greets new people and talks of vampire things he does, before Michelle Pheiffer steps in and throws them off track by making up an explanation to hide the fact he is a vampire. These scenes could have been much funnier, but look like they where just added in at last minute to try and make some humor for the rest of the mostly dull and boring dialog.<br /><br />The witch who first cursed the guy is still alive too, and she finds out about his return and confronts the guy, and says he must either join her corporation of selling fish, or he will spend another century buried in a tomb. The guy still does not love her, even tho he gives her a vampire vs witch love making scene that failed to be funny, but then says he still doesn't love her, instead he is in love with someone who looked like his former girlfriend. Played by a not-so pretty woman who hardly appears or speaks in the film, it was done horribly wrong to care about.<br /><br />Besides the mother character of Pheiffer, she also has a cheating husband, an annoying 70's style emo daughter, a dork of a kid for a son who rips off the kid from Jurassic park and Jumanji too much, and a nanny who see's dead people. The witch threatens to hurt the kids if the guy doesn't do what she wants, and of coarse, he refuses and the battle is on.<br /><br />By the time the movie ends, it felt rushed, and things seemed thrown in at last second. I wont spoil it for you, but I will say this which will make more sense if you see the part in general... what the hell was with the werewolf thing? It made no sense, was pointless and a stupid idea.<br /><br />The only decent part of this movie was the appearance of Alice Cooper. Playing an intro to Schools Out, into No More Mr Nice Guy and then Balled of Dwight Fry. However, almost ruined when the music is turned down to hear boring \\"is it my breath\\" dialog of a 100 year old vampire trying to kiss someone who looks 17 years old who see's dead people.<br /><br />Why can't vampire legend be left as it was? Why does this one try to give up drinking blood to fit into the times, look like a bad emo version of Aston Kutcher, and be dead, but have enough blood in his body to keep his heart going to actually get an erection? If the heart doesn't pump blood, no way will that happen... but yet, this guy manages to accept some oral enjoyment from a character in the movie... yeah, just, wouldn't happen if vampires did exist. Sorry ladies, but if Johnny was a vampire, he'd be useless to you in that area, so quit fantasizing about it :P<br /><br/>Some parts of the movie where funny, but not all that memorable, so I wouldn't even call this movie \\"dark humor\\"... thats just something people say when Johnny Depp and Tim Burton make films together... but, it's not what I would call dark. Sorry, but dark humor is not humor played out in a night-time setting.<br /><br />Overall, worthy of a rental, but not to keep and watch again if you are not obsessed with certain actors or the role they are playing. But beware, the ending is is as rushes and stupid as possible and makes little to no sense. Leaving you with the dissatisfaction that the movie was intended to make money on Depp as a vampire, and not a decent script to do so.

B007U8U1V8|4.0|Blunderbuss shows more of Jack White's genius.  This is not the White Stripes, but the twists and turns of the album I believe will intrigue you if you like any of Jack's work.  At first listen I did not like this album immediately, but it didn't take long for it to grow on me.  The lyrics and song structure is top notch and everything you would expect from Jack White.  Take caution as this album may grab your fingers gently, slam them in a doorway, then put you face into the ground.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|wow this is such a captivating game! the graphics are the best ive seen. the story line really pulls you in and some of the parts have even made me jump! im hooked, for the price you cant beat it.

B007NG93CK|4.0|I don't know how Kathy Reichs continues to keep the series fresh but this book is terrific.  The only reason that it doesn't have 5 stars is that in places it got quite technical in description and it can make the enjoyable past time of reading tedious to get through wads of detail.  However, the twists and turns in the story, the unique setting of the story and the pace of the action of the novel will ensure that this is forgiven and everything will be left aside until the book is completed.
0525952926|5.0|I'm wondering about the negative reviews.  The first review was another Kindle price basher but it pretty much seemed to get squashed before it really started.  I gave the comments about poor character development and ghost writers some serious thought.  I don't see it.  All I can say is I thoroughly enjoyed the read and will be buying the next one.
B0095R64AO|4.0|I really liked this movie. It had an usually ending but getting there was fun to watch. I would recommend this movie.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|I find it amazing that you have to scroll through so many pages here to find anyone who is reviewing the blu ray disc and when they do, they just say that it was exciting and that they liked it.  Sorry, that is not a review. Once again, with Amazon's now downloadable viewing there is no separation of reviews of the downloaded versions, which are highly compressed, the standard def versions, and the blu ray versions.  Amazon would do us all a huge service by separating these 3 different formats of viewing.<br /><br />I don't give plot summaries or my opinions of the movies, the acting or any of that nonsense. If I didn't initially like a movie, I certainly wouldn't bother to buy it.  I will admit that when I first saw the film, my only complaint was that it was too short.<br /><br />Thus, this review focuses, as do all my reviews, only on the quality of the transfer to blu ray itself.<br /><br />The audio is DTS HD 5.1 and makes good use of the front sound stage with appropriate panning across the screen.  Not a whole lot for the rear channels in terms of discreet channeling as they are mostly used for ambient sound but not necessarily discreet foley effects.  There are many scenes where the rears could easily have been used for such but this is typical of theatrical releases who are stingy with their audio budgets.  Even an old movie like 'Air Force One' made great use of the rear channels so ' Taken' certainly could have.<br /><br />The video transfer is good.  Not great.  No grain, artifacts or any image issues and there are details in the shadows.  However, the overall color images are rather soft when, in many places, they really could and should have stood out more.  This is the reason why I lowered the great pop corn movie from 5 to 4 stars.  I don't believe that, if you already have the 2 disc version on Standard Def DVDs, that you will notice a truly significant enhancement between the two.  Not much, if any remastering was done here other than reformatting the film to Blu Ray.<br /><br />Lots of wasted space on the blu ray with trailers for other movies and not much else other than the usual commentaries that can be found on the SD DVDs.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksthe film to Blu Ray.<br /><br />Lots of wasted space on the blu ray with trailers for other movies and not much else other than the usual commentaries that can be found on the SD DVDs.<br /><br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks
B003Y5H5B0|2.0|Not that im saying Jonah Hill wasin't funny, it' just that he wasin't in this one. And when you executive produce and star in it thats proably to much. Channing was really funny did'int expect that at all he always does drama. I liked him big he had more humor as in his other ones: [[ASIN:B000WZEZGI Superbad (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B003VPX5Y4 Get Him to the Greek (Single-Disc Edition)]] & His latest one [[ASIN:B004LWZW5G The Sitter]]. The laughs were ok cant say it made me crack up like the back-cover said \\"Your laugh till it hurts\\" NOT. But it's alright, i would rent this like i did $1.99 not bad though.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am so addicted to this game, and have introduced others to it but this version is driving me absolutely bunkers.  It force closes so often it makes no sense.  I have lost more gifts and energy this way, and the energy takes forever to reload.

Did I mention that none of the gift codes work?<br />I think its time to delete this version and return to facebook or ipad and just continue to read books on the kindle.  I am so disappointed.

B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love this game.  I just downloaded and cannot stop playing.  ready to level up.  it works great on my kindle fire.  cant wait to finish the game.
0553801473|5.0|A wonderful book, and only disappointing in the fact, that I must wait another few years for the next installment.
B000024EXP|5.0|I remember when this first came out in vinyl in December 1976. I bought it along with The Missing Piece by Gentle Giant, and spent all afternoon progging out on both splendid records. Both epic and poetic, Wind and Wuthering is the last Genesis album with Steve Hackett on Guitar. It is in a way the last of the truly British folklore albums by Genesis, dealing with historical epochs like 11th Earl of Mar, or fantasy tales such as All in Mouse's House.  The production quality on the re-master is superb, whether you play it on surround sound or a portable player. Wot Gorilla is a clever jam tune, and of course Your own Special Way was the single for this record.<br />Blood on the Rooftops seem to be the consensus favorite of the band itself, according to recent interviews in Prog Magazine this last summer. This song is still timely today, in light of the Mid East situation.<br />This is must own for Prog rock fans, and will appeal to devotees of fantasy and mythology as well.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game. I think I've spent tons of quarters playing this game, so playing for free is a welcome treat
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this fun interesting game. It is a great game to download for kids and adults it can also waist some time if h need it to.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book will keep you up at night; mainly to keep reading to find out what happens next. More twists and turns than a scary roller coaster.
B000H4TX9I|3.0|Really enjoyed it but the last couple episodes had way too much sex.  Intimacy should be between husband and wife and is sacred and private.
B0098VXE50|3.0|It was a fun film but not a great film.  All of the old cliches were there, the dwarfs, the apple and the talking mirror. There was lots of action and it moved well.  Even though it was not great, I did enjoy it.
B00932A2MC|4.0|I was not expecting this movie to have so much action.  Storyline was a bit far-fetched in reality to military, but that is what going to the movies is all about - being entertained.  Enjoyed the humor.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book! Unfortunately every thing said gives some of the premise away.<br />Anywho....<br />Fortunately or not, these people seemed very real to me. Well until she went too far. But I understood the wife much more than the husband. It is very easy to see how a chick who was a money maker for her parents, had no feelings for other people. She was revered but never looked at too deeply and never asked to be too much. What I don't get. I really don't get why she so wanted that husband. Even in the end.  But unlike other readers, I thought how it ended was appropriate. This sounds weird but I will say this.... That woman, the character that the author created,  would only have let it end that way.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|He was kind of all over the place in the story. He would be describing a mission in Iraq then he would digress and start talking about childhood in Alaska. The story was good when the writer stayed focused on the bin laden raid.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I was bored on netflix one day and always saw vampire diaries on there and thought hell no, the only show i love right now is sons of anarchy and twilight was enough of the \\"vampire craze\\" for me but my curiosity got the best of me and I'm thankful it did.  I was interested as I started watching season 1 and then I couldn't stop, in less than 2 weeks I got through all 3 seasons of Vampire Diaries.  Wonderful show, amazing story lines, twists, action and thrills, its mysterious, simplistic, but so much to take in.  Amazing acting and so many characters to fall in love with.  I was waiting for this show to get cheesy but it hasn't even come close. Season 3 was amazingly powerful, be careful with episode 7 though, I never even tear up during emotional moments watching tv and I was bawling at the end of that episode, it snuck up on me. I can't imagine anyone who watched that episode not have dry eyes at the end, such a moving episode. Can't wait for season 4!
B008BO61BE|5.0|Screaming for Vengeance 30th Anniversary has a little more to offer than British Steel did, they didn't do an anniversary tour like they did for British Steel, but they added the 1983 US Festival Tour for the first time to DVD, that's a huge plus there, and the included the 2002 remastered album and added rare live tracks as well. British Steel is where they boost for the 80's mainstream metal, and Screaming For Vengeance boost even higher Its too bad that the 1981 album \\"Point of Entry\\" didn't get a 30th Anniversary, i mean i know it wasn't that much on par with the other two albums when it comes to metal, but i still think all three of those albums deserve the equal respect, when it comes to music videos, Point of Entry did three, British Steel did two, and Screaming for Vengeance did one. Well i think you priest fans get the point. I hope they make an anniversary of \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" and \\"Turbo\\". Well above like the Anniversary album of British Steel, if your a Priset fan, i totally recommend Screaming for Vengeance anniversary album. One of best albums of 1982 (the year i was born)!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It's $2.00 but it's worth it.u can use it if u want to know more information about your battery life then just saying 34% battery left.
B003AYPMBU|5.0|British Steel was a groundbreaking album in 1980 with hits like \\"Living After Midnight\\" and \\"Breaking The Law\\", 1980 was a year that many metal bands that made an impact and Judas Priest is one those bands. 30 year there still groundbreaking. Anniversary live DVD is fantastic and it was a a nice bonus to add other live songs to make it worth your while. The anniversary cover was awesome, but the album booklet could have been better. Either than that the album is the same as the 2002 remastered album and the anniversary DVD kick ass, if your a Priest fan, i totally recommend it!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Decided I loved the show so much had to buy the seasons to watch at home on DVD.  They were delivered earlier that estimated delivery date (awesome).  They were new so in great condition.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I just got minecraft, and uh I usually play it on the computer but I wanted to bring it with me. All of a sudden it crashes and wont open up again. I am giving minecraft pe a 4 star because I still like the game, it jet stole my money and wont work help if you know the problem I am having, would really like to play minecraft again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i really enjoyed these books and hopefully as indicated at the end of the third book, there will be more in this series. My friends and i read this series so fast that i was disappointed when I was finished.  Whoever passed on publishing these books must really be kicking themselves.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I don't know what to do, none of the games I buy work. I really wnlouod like to play this but it wont work help plz
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|The best movie ever according to my grandaughter. And by letting her watch it on the Kindle I don't have to watch it 100 times over and over!
B0058YPL66|5.0|Excellent show.  Kinda like Lost, where you have multiple stories/people, and as you go, you get their backstory or other world story.  New season looks interesting as well.  (As long as in Season 6 they don't find out that they are in purgatory, or that it was all a dream...)
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I have not watched this series in the past so I was looking forward to seeing what this was all about.  I have to say after watching this I was quite impressed! The show is quite intense, and has such great complex characters and a plot that is so engrossing and keeps you on the edge of your seat from the start to finish of each episode. That show is also full of so many twists and turns, that you will not see what is going to happen next. If you like a series that is full of great writing, characters, dialogue, sets and artistry, this is the series for you! I am hooked and I know you will be too, just pick this up and you will be impressed!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is an amazing story about two damaged individuals coming together - definitely one of the best books I have read in 2012.  Jamie McGuire makes the reader believe they are in the story - her characters are so real and her dialogue so realistic.  Go out and read it!!!
1607053888|5.0|Found this book in my library, borrowed it. Read it, looked through the patterns, returned it. I did this so many times per bag I made, I finally just decided to buy the book! This book was my first attempt at making a bag too, so good for beginners that want to try something other than a \\"tote\\".
B005LUJWBM|4.0|Could not put the book down - an excellent read - typical David Badalci. I would recommend to anyone who likes this style of writing.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|THis instruction manual was well written and easy to follow. I had no problem formatting my book the first time I used the book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book moved very well. I thought it was very well written.  The information seemed to go along with the information I have read from other accounts in most cases.  The differences in some accounts were small points but could make a big differnce in the way people look at the US from an international standpoint but who is telling the facts the way they really happened.  I would guess that the account we have heard from the government may be a bit different than the way it really happened.  I think we will know in a year or so which is the correct account of things because others that were there will either verify or discount the accounts in this book.  I tend to think No Easy Day is the proper account.<br />Great book... Thank you to all the guys and gals that have put and are putting their lives on the line for our country...
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I was attached to SDVT-1 ASDS at the time of this tragedy. I played water polo and worked out with this amazing bunch of guys. Their story had to be told. Thank you Marcus and God bless you and your family.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wonderful read all around.  The author does a great job of character development.  Although not typically a science fiction fan, this book had all the great stuff fiction is made of.  I could not put it down and look forward to more books in the series!!
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  Like a few other people I did get stuck on level 6, but once I figured out that yellow was the only color that paired with itself it was really easy.  Now I am on level 15.  This game is easy to play yet challenging. I also like the fact that the developer cares what we think. You don't need instructions because they are in the description of the game.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of Joss Whedon's genius will love this as much as every other thing he has touched with his brilliance. I truly believe this show didn't last longer because it was just ahead of its time. Firefly takes you to a future so unique that you will be immediately drawn in and have trouble imagining it any other way. There is a character for every viewer out there, and whether it be Jayne's lewdness,Mal's innate leadership and bravery, or River's adorable innocence and genius, no one is capable of watching this show and not LOVING it! If you don't believe me, give it a try and see if you can prove me wrong... you can't:)
B0083SBMBM|5.0|so purchased this movie for my husband who is a DC and Marvel comics fanatic.  I couldn't get him to go to the theater to watch-didn't want to spend the money.  I pre-ordered and recied it exactly when promised.  I sat down to watch with him just to be together after a long week at work.<br /><br />received unopened, new.<br />it is a great movie.<br />action paced of course.<br />comedy.<br />we picked one upfor our grandson for his birthday also.  He had already seen it in the theatre. but was so excited to see it again.  he is 8 yr old.<br /><br />it would probalby help to watch \\"thor\\" before watching this one.  There were a few other references I didn't understand, but we'd pause the movie, hubby would explain and go on.  but really did n't take from the experience.<br /><br />we have watched it 2x's and loaned to a family member who also has watched it 2x's.<br /><br />enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well, Book 2 did not dissapoint, I'm loving every minute of it,  almost done with 2 , ready to order 3.  If you have not read the first one ,  50 Shades of Grey,  please do,  and then get this one, Book 2, I love these books great story, love, sex, kinkiness.  All good!
B00699SDR8|3.0|While there is a great deal of philosophical thought covered in relatively short order (500 pages in print version), the device of question and answer between the teacher and student is tedious. The puzzles in the interludes between pedagogy lead to a mind-boggling conclusion. My sympathy to the young narrator Sophie and her guide to the world of thought, Alberto, who finally melt away like the Cheshire Cat. Be hopeful and  remember, \\"The only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder.\\"
B0061PEAUY|5.0|As always this book by Kathy Reichs was sooooo good. she always puts alot of dynamics into her work. I like it when she is in Canada and working closely with Ryan, what a twosome they make. Sometimes the French words are hard to understand. Keep these books comming.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a fun fast read, mainly because it was hard to put down. So many twists and turns in a good who dunnit. I thought I had it all figured out and I was wrong. There could've been several aternative endings. Have fun!
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Pentatonix are awesome!  The intricacies in the arrangements, the tight harmonies, and the phenomenal bass and beatbox make them an incredible group.  All the songs are great, my favorite being Aha!.  Can't wait for another album.
1401937519|5.0|Having experienced NDE's and read of many others, I wasn't enthusiastic about this book. A long time student and friend gave this to me saying she had been inspired in ways that could not be explained.  But she felt I would get it's message given what she had learned from me over the years. Weeks before I picked the book up, my dear neighbor died from cancer at age 51.  Struggling with fatigue and minor personal issues, I \\"humored\\" my friend and opened the book.<br /><br />From that moment on, it was difficult to put down. With some books offering views different from any traditional path, I experience internal resistance or confusion.  I felt nothing but crystal clarity as I inhaled this experience.  My mind and brain felt like a fusion of connections were occurring in ways that were totally odd for me.  In the end, it simply must be read and brought into each reader's being-ness for personal integration.  Foolish of me to add unnecessary words.<br /><br />This may seem like a simple book with simple ideas; but I find it profound, inspiring for me to continue my own work on self.  Dive deep where judgment is unnecessary and freedom exists.  Or, walk away and all is still well.  A bumper sticker:  Try Being Informed Instead of Just Opinionated.  This is one of my favorite reminders to keep my mind open.  Currently my all time favorite is: \\"To be truly radical is to make hope possible rather than despair convincing.\\"<br /><br />As a bereaved parent, sibling and aunt, thank you, Anita Moorjani for sharing your experience and for the clarity of your efforts to put words to things where words are feeble representations of infinite love.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book is wonderful!!!<br />But let me talk about Amazon delivery of Kindle Pre-orders.<br />I bought this book ahead of time so I could read it at Midnight.  It was not delivered until nearly 1am.<br /><br />UM, maybe Amazon doesn't know about time zones, but midnight is midnight.  I don't really care if midnight, Eastern Time is earlier at Amazon headquarters, it's midnight for me and I paid for the book.<br /><br />Nook got it at midnight.  If Amazon can't deliver at Midnight Eastern, I don't really have a problem buying from B&N or getting it on the iPad.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|For nearly I week I have lived with this album and listened to it at least a dozen times.  It has not ceased to be beautiful, brilliant, inspiring, and hopeful.  Each listen reveals more, both musically and lyrically.<br /><br />Mumford & Sons have released two albums that prove the future is moored to the past, that we cannot and should not try to leave it all behind in a full on postmodern, technological embrace.  A few have mentioned that the guitar and banjo playing can be similar from track to track.  This is true because both are rhythmic instruments here.  Folk is ultimately based on rhythm and so most of the foundation here is to support the rhythm and drive the song forward.  The power there is to accent the voices and what they sing.<br /><br />Biblical allusion is hard to miss here - with a name like Babel, how could it not be?  That concept can be seen throughout the album - the idea of trying to get to God through human means, erecting all kinds of towers and facades along the way while trying to avoid looking at ourselves honestly.  I can't even begin to hit on all the recurring themes throughout each song, but they are all tied together.<br /><br />I'm going to assume that the regular version of the album is the artistic statement meant to be made here.  The Deluxe is likely just a couple extra tracks.  So it is worth paying attention to the conclusion - and it is stunning, much like it was on Sigh No More.  There are so many great songs here, but the crescendo of Below My Feet is definitely a high point - a prayer to stay grounded despite the allure of the world around.  The final statement, Not With Haste, is so hopeful and beautiful:<br /><br />\\"Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste<br />As it keeps my heart and soul in its place<br />And I will love with urgency but not with haste\\"<br /><br />Profound.  But that is commonplace when it comes to Mumford & Sons.<br /><br />This is the best album I've heard since, well, since their first one, Sigh NoMore.  If you haven't heard that one, give it a listen and then listen to this one.  Be prepared to be taken somewhere else.  Utterly brilliant.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I've asked before, but am still wondering why there's no individual episodes purchable yet. It's rather important to me. Anyone?
B008G12ERC|5.0|Muse have returned! The 2nd Law is the 6th studio album by the band who over the last 13 years (officially) have developed a gigantic, rabid fan base and put together an impressive resume and B-side back catalogue. Initially written off by critics as nothing more than Radiohead \\"lite\\", they have since far exceeded perceived limitations and expectations from critics and listeners. From sell out stadium shows to having their material appear in blockbuster movies and the Olympics, Muse prove year after year that it is nearly (if not impossible) for the trio hailing from Teignmouth to lose momentum. With each release, their live shows grow increasingly grandiose, their material more complex, orchestral and progressive, and their acquisition of new fans increases (almost)exponentially.<br /><br />The culture shock of listening to any new Muse album is one of the more difficult parts of being a fan, and with good reason.  Every time they release new material, the band finds cunning ways to reinvent their sound and it's as though we're not even listening to the same group anymore. We expect to hear songs similar to their last album because let's face it, Muse are so darn good at planting the seed of attachment and leaving us in disarray when it's over. We beg for more, but instead Muse shatter our expectations when they switch gears and run in the opposite direction.<br /><br />So what does that mean for The 2nd Law? Which album does it resemble the most? Does it have the chaotic, guitar driven madness safely quarantined in Origin of Symmetry? How about the methodic, visceral rhythms of Absolution? Is there any of that splendor we loved so much about Black Holes?<br /><br />The answer is: none of the above. Though the second law is vaguely comparable (if at all) to any of their previous work, we still hear familiar elements of the Queen-esque grandeur, political undertone, environmental catastrophe and Bellamy's fascination with conspiracy and human corruption that makes their music so palpable. This time around, Muse spend some time experimenting with a more synthetic, electronic tone but there is still plenty of tantalizing variety to sate even the most insatiable of Muse fan appetites. Supremacy starts the album off with a groovy orchestral sound fitting for a James Bond flick and then transitions into Madness. The second track begins innocently enough with a soft, pulsating beat, crescendos into a soaring, haunting plea for forgiveness and embrace of love. It eventually ends with the softness it started with, tacking on a subtle introspection referencing its title. The track Panic Station is reminiscent of early Red Hot Chili Peppers/INXS with its heavy funk tone while Survival ruminates in a gooey, orchestral swell that rises, eventually overflowing into a no-holds barred anarchic shred fest. At the peak of the song, Dominic maniacally attacks his drums, Chris engineers the only kind of bass line capable of sustaining all the chaos and Matt bellows and wails his heart out about surviving at all costs. Follow Me is drenched with savory, electronic goodness (and i'm not even a fan of the genre!), Animals is strangely reminiscent of Screenager from Muse' Origin Days with it's chorus, and though it doesn't provide much for the album other than a nice intermission from the album's first half and a wonderfully executed guitar lead, it's still a solid track worth revisiting. Chris has his share of vocal duties on the tracks Save Me and Liquid state (which seem to tell the woes of a man drowning in his alcoholism, literally), but they fall short and may just be the 2 weakest tracks on this album. That isn't to say they aren't good, because they do work in the context of the album and seem to fit in with the rest of the songs.<br /><br />Other tracks include Explorers with its beautiful, Invincible/Guiding Light like melody, Big Freeze which seems eerily influenced (in a good way!) by Joshua Tree era U2 with it's upbeat (albeit a tad poppy) groove and the last 2 tracks which make heavy references to the album's title and experiment with elements of dubstep, electronica and the orchestral vibe we heard on the Exogenesis symphony (The Resistance, 2009).<br /><br />If there's one thing Muse have always been good at, it's continually challenging themselves to defy the status quo most would have them maintain. Rather than copping out to an obviously successful formula, they choose instead to invent new ways to approach a particular sound or style while retaining their musical integrity which is what they've succeeded with here. There are no sequels in Muse's discography. There are only a handful of unique albums that stand alone, each with its own merits. Ultimately, what The 2nd Law does is capture the essence of the current state of their career. They, like the songs are larger than life, captivating and seemingly unstoppable superstars. It most certainly won't hit the mark for every listener, but for me the 2nd Law is loud, bombastic, grand, energetic and above all, it's unapologetically Muse.<br /><br />My only real advice before you listen to this album is to do it with a good set of headphones. You'll hear sounds you didn't think possible to hear. It's wonderfully layered and mixed, and sounds phenomenal.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|In preparation for this book. I reread Bared and was thinking that this book would really have to be intense to top it. Well, thats an understatement in describing this book! I devoured this book the second my preorder downloaded on my kindle, ( at 1:25am, not at all happy about the fact Amazon couldn't get it to me at 12am sharp!)I preordered the third one already too! These two are addicting and you just hope and pull for them, hurt for them, laugh at them and pant just a little because of them! I'm going to read it again and it's not even been out 24 hours. This second installment is so full of raw emotion and the supporting characters really start to blossom. I can't believe Entwined will be out by the end of the year and we will be done with this series! I feel like it should go on forever!
B006R1T40I|5.0|I've been listening to Bonnie'smusic for atleast 40 years and found that she continues to recoerd amazing music. Theres many sides to her music: blues/rock of the 70s; funk/pop in the 80's, reggae/funk/pop of the ninties... well she knocked it out of the park on this CD. Bonnie brings back her roots with blues, rock & one reggae tune, and teamed up w/Johnnie Lee Shell... Wow... the best CD since \\"sweet forgiveness.\\" She even did a reggae version of Jerry Rafferty's \\"right down the line.\\" This CD is a runner up for CD of the year.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|12 episodes.  12 reasons to purchase if you don't subscribe to Showtime.  Well worth the money at Amazon.  Looking forward to season 2 next year right during 2013 Night Emmy's.  Hope they do just as well as they did this year for Awards.
B005KTZ05G|5.0|The toy is awesome it has great detail,O.K. accesories and the sculpt is awesome and it is very in line with the game. The packaging is very hard to open but it is worth it. You can get it into some very awesome poses. I reccomend it to any Assassin's Creed fan or collecter.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is a fast paced Novel.    Great Read!  Will recommend  it to many of my friends.  Good book for book clubs.
B004EPXXGA|4.0|I loved this book.  It was such an interesting insight into a man's perspective on love and his values.  Beautifully written, it felt like a very intimate tale.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|you should get this game. it is the best!!!!you can get alot of coins-and it is so adducing.you will LOVE. IT!!!!
B0037RDPEG|1.0|This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read.  So badly written I just wanted to take my editor's pencil to it or re-write it. Preachy tone, boring prose.<br />Someone told me that it would be a good book to read while I was in Ubud.  The only good thing to do with this book in Ubud was to throw it into the ravine of the Monkey Forest.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it because this app helps me know how much battery life I have left on my kindle fire.

B006LQQ1GE|3.0|The American breakthrough of Gotye is an interesting if slight work. The freaky breakthrough of \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" knocked top 40 world on a loop. Here was a song that didn't have auto-tune, manufactured beats, and you sure couldn't dance to it. (In fact, some radio stations took to adding drum tracks to try and force fit the song that was too popular to deny into the narrow confines of their station's sound.) The man had a voice that fell somewhere between Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. By all accounts, \\"Making Mirrors\\" shouldn't be a hot number in the age of Justin Beiber and \\"Call Me Maybe.\\"<br /><br />Yet it was. \\"Making Mirrors\\" is now the unlikliest hit album of the summer because of that. I just don't know how Gotye will be able to sustain his success. I keep thinking of The Dream Academy back in the 80's, when one unlikely but sublime single catapulted an album into hitdom, but doomed the followups. The songs here are not awful by any means, but the quirky, xylophone sampled \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" is the outstanding song among the crop. There are plenty of clever bits to be found, like the Kraftwerkian \\"State of The Art\\" while the Mowtown/Phil Collins ringer \\"I Feel Better\\" could make a decent radio tune.<br /><br />I just can't find much beyond these songs to recommend the rest of the CD by. Gotye makes nice pleasing pop without the trappings of modern recording technology (minus the sample-happy construction), but he's no Kiesha, you follow? However, the depth issue my limit his likelihood of sustaining a career, much less making a solid, better than C-grade CD.
0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse-Five sets out to protest war without glorifying it, and it succeeds in accomplishing that task. Vonnegut can find no answer for mankind's decisions to commit gross violence against its own kind, except in the meaningless song of a bird: \\"Poo-tee-weet?\\" He purposely does not develop his characters with any depth, a decision that works because it signifies the toll that war takes on the individual. The novel's hero, Billy Pilgrim, wanders through life with little concern or feeling for anything. It doesn't seem to bother him that he slips through time, to the past, the present, and the future. Then again, I wonder if it's possible to read the time travel element on a less literal level. As I was reading it, I couldn't help but wonder whether the alien species called the Tralfamadorians were a part of Billy's damaged postwar mind, a symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder.<br /><br />Vonnegut makes lots of use of irony, satire, and humor, and in surprising ways. The famous line from the novel, one he uses in relation to death, \\"So it goes,\\" seems to comment on society's desensitized attitudes towards death. The phrase calmly and easily tosses the impact of death aside, yet sometimes the reader can't help but feel its effects immensely, particularly in the way the phrase actually draws more attention to death. Vonnegut has a gift for drawing the reader's attention to the sadness of human fate by making us laugh. One of the funniest scenes of the book takes place at a POW camp, where English POWs welcome the exhausted Americans by putting on a play of Cinderella. At one point Billy laughs and can't stop laughing until his laughter turns into shrieks and he has to be carried into the hospital. I don't think I laughed harder in the novel than at this point, but I felt guilty for laughing. Billy's uncontrollable laughter was a product of the horrible things he experienced in the war up to that point.<br /><br />There seem to be lots of hints scattered about that Tralfamadore is a product of Billy's imagination. After his first encounter with Montana Wildhack, for example, he wakes up in his home in Ilium to realize he's just had a wet dream about her. That his perhaps imaginary experience on Tralfamadore serves as a coping mechanism for his experiences in the war can be found in parallel descriptions about him undressing in Dresden and on the flying saucer. Kilgore Trout, Billy's favorite author, is probably the biggest piece of evidence to show that Billy has only imagined his encounter with the Tralfamadorians. For one, many of the ideas we learn from Trout's books are very similar to details we learn about the Tralfamadorians, such as the fact they can perceive sexes in the fourth dimension. But Trout is also a big clue about the reliability of the narrator.<br /><br />We can assume the narrator is the author himself, since Vonnegut makes many mentions of himself in the first person. Some of what he says is factual. Dresden was bombed, and Vonnegut was there when it was bombed. However, Kilgore Trout is a fictional person, though he's not treated as such. This mixture of fact and fiction, both told as though they were one and the same, clues the reader in that we can't necessarily take the narrator at his word. Thus, though he describes Tralfamadore as though it were real, that doesn't mean it is. It could very easily be a product of Billy's post-traumatic stress disorder, a coping mechanism. The idea that Billy can see all times of his life is never fully established either. We don't really know when the present time is, so it's difficult to gauge whether we truly do see into Billy's future. There is a scene where Billy describes how he dies, but this scene is tricky. It's not written as something that has or is happening, as the rest of the scenes are, and the narrator states it not as fact, but as something Billy has said. The question is, can we take Billy at his word? I don't think so.that Tralfamadore is a product of Billy's imagination.

B004G5ZY7E|5.0|This is the second book of Jo Nesbo I am reading.  The first was \\"The Leopard\\" I read in the wrong order. I love the suspense and mystery.<br />The author keeps you on your toes, so to speak, keeps you guessing again and again until the last word.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I was not prepared for the magic of this movie!  It isn't your typical fairy tale, and I thought that it was incredible!  I have not been a Kristen Stewart fan, because up to now, I have not seen her in anything that she could really act in.  This movie proved/showed her acting chops and her performance was almost as good as Charlize Theron's.  I recommend this movie highly if you like intense, action/adventure, twists on fairy tales.  This one should not disappoint you!
B00062PN6I|2.0|I had purchased these about 4 months ago for a cheap pair of dj headphones. Now I know why they are so cheap. I never have my cue volume all the way up, but somehow these headphones still blew out or something. The right phone just stopped working suddenly. Also, the color is silver, even though it may appear white in the product picture. They had a decent run, but I would suggest to purchase something better if you're a dj (even a bedroom dj).
B0030B624E|3.0|This wasn't as funny as I had heard it would be.  But if you're looking for a movie that you don't have to pay much attention to, in order to figure out what is happening, this movie is it.  Woody Harrelson, as usual, delivers a solid performance.

1609611543|5.0|This book will blow your mind.  You could also call it \\"The Myth of Whole Grains\\".  I read it six weeks ago, and as an experiment gave up wheat and other grain products after Chapter 1.  Everything in this book is true.  I have lost weight without even trying.  I have no more aches and pains, which I was attributing to getting older and the inevitable arthritis.  (Now I know that was all about inflammation caused by today's version of wheat).  I am no longer bloated or constipated.  I am sleeping better and wake up in a good mood with no \\"fog\\".  Best of all, I'm not depressed, and my anxiety is gone.  I love bread and other wheat/grain products as much as anyone, but now I see that those items are terrible for my health. I will never go back to eating the way I did before.  If you truly value your health, get this book and read it and stop eating wheat and other \\"whole grains\\".

B000002MTR|5.0|I never have been able to figure this one out. One Hot Minute is clearly RHCP's lightning rod for barbs and slams from fans, the press and even the band members themselves, although I suspect the band's gripes were directed more at their situation than the music.  And that's a shame. Nestled between their mid '80's hip frat-boy college-punk/funk thing and their rather sleepy tunes of the past dozen or so years, the Chili's found a sound and style that set them apart from the rest of the quasi-funk/hard rock movement of the late 80's and early 90's (think Living Colour, Faith No More, etc). Their trilogy of musical terror started  with 1989's Mother's Milk, followed by their masterwork BSSM and concluding with the much maligned One Hot Minute. A revolving door of guitarists stopped momentarily to allow ex-Jane's Addiction Dave Navarro to climb aboard. In return, Navarro gave the Peppers a (much needed) dose of heavy ass-kickery. His sound, looks and style was a perfect compliment for an already schizophrenic band (and I mean that in a good way!). Alas, drug addictions and general bad vibes sank this titanic lineup. All we have for a souvenir is this album, a huge mix of funk, hard rock, psychedelia and general groov-i-tude! Navarro's penchant for thick sounds, coexist side-by-side with great little nuances, effects and licks. Coffee Shop, Warped, Aeroplane and Walkabout are great examples of the dynamics at play on OHM.<br /><br />Bottom line: if ya like it hard, heavy yet groovy, buy the damn album.  You'll love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hooked from page one; immediately caring about the characters.  The first book was the best - such a page turner!  I missed a lot of sleep trying to find out what happened next.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I started reading this series after the first movie.   I have not read straight through a book in quite some time, let alone two!  If a story can have that effect on me, I think it deserves a 5.  This book is great for anyone who enjoys, adventure/thriller type stories, with a flare for a view into the future.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Fifty Shades of ... who freaking cares.<br /><br />Bared to You was better. Reflected in You was absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />WOW. Is all I can say. I could not put this book down.<br /><br />The first thing I want to say is THANK YOU for writing a heroine who I don't want to punch in the teeth. A heroine who is strong, who gives as good as she gets, who has friends and family that love her, and who, if needed, could move beyond the hero for the sake of herself. A heroine who EATS!!! Thank you for that. Also, thanks for making her a curvy little blonde. There are no where near enough of us in these books, it's always a waif like brunette.<br /><br />It makes a huge difference I think having an author who isn't jumping on the bandwagon or writing fan fiction that is somehow published but is actually established and successful in the romance genre. All the best features of a good, smart author who understands that readers want an intelligent book are here, and then it's absolutely steamy without being over the top which makes a huge difference. There are not as many sex scenes as you might think, and that just makes what is there all the more powerful. The emotional climate of this book is insane.<br /><br />This book is emotionally fraught, sad, frustrating and freaking HOT. Two enormously flawed and damaged people, it was almost too much to bare at times. But just wow ... what a fantastic example of the genre. Now I need book three ... like immediately please Ms Day. I can't wait until December.<br /><br />Four stars instead of five because I don't think they can escape the scope of what happens in this book without genuine consequences, it goes far to far for there not to be ramifications in a number of different ways, and because the relationship became so frustrating at times that it really seemed like it would be better if they both walked away. However, hopefully Ms Day will pull it off in book three.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|It makes you think about how you are living and how would you really want your life to be. The book don't give you all the answers, but instigates you to think!

B008GVD6D8|5.0|Read more reviews on my blog Coffee, Books & Lipgloss<br /><br />I'm still in an utter loss for words and I can't find it in me to express how this book made me feel. Got it today and finished it in one sitting. Ignored everyone and everything and God I'm still tingling from the experience.<br /><br />Beautiful and jam-packed with such raw emotion... my heart broke almost all the way through... I got the girly giggles every other page and I heated up just from reading the insanely descriptive love scene's.<br /><br />A perfect follow-up to the previous book Bared to You and I'm so happy about the way things turned out in the end :)<br /><br />Gideon Cross once again proved that although he's one hell of a fine specimen... he's just as much human as the next guy. He's passionate and deep and that's exactly how I love to be.<br /><br />Eva completely surprised me in this second book. I can't help but feel proud at how she seems to have matured throughout this book. In the beginning she's still the same sweet but spicy Eva... but as the book progresses her personal growth is clearly evident and I left with a sense of pride at her actions and reactions. I didn't realize it at all while I read the book, but as soon as I finished the last sentence... that's the second thought that came to mind (The first beginning \\"You got to be kidding me with this cliffhanger ending!\\") Proud of you Eva!<br /><br />I enjoyed the way the old characters reappeared in this book ~ but without taking up too much time. I really enjoyed that their roles were important without stealing thunder from Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />I loved that we got to find out Gideon's secret and then a bonus drama added which completely threw me into a flat-spin ~ but completely lapped up all the same :)<br /><br />Now I admit that the second book didn't have the same bite as the first (Bared to You), but then again you can't really judge it in that light. We leant to either love them or hate them from the first book and if you loved them then no matter what they do in this book... you'll always be a fan. It's the same feeling in every book really that have a second installment... you will never ever be as captivated by characters as you where when you first let them in, regardless of the plot or emotions a second book gives you. The first will always be the favorite and that's perfectly acceptable. That's how I feel about Reflected in you. I learnt from the first book that I loved them and I knew that the second would never give me that first love flutter and it's simply put out there to scratch that needing itch to continue following their story as they build their life together.<br /><br />All I can add to the ending of this book is that I cannot wait for the 3rd one. 31 December (apparently that's when it's released) can't come soon enough for me and I'm so excited. The New Year will start off with an official Bang when I get my hands on Entwined with You (book 3)!<br /><br />After all the hype and public press about Reflected in You, I'm so glad I was not for one second left hanging or feeling empty when I finished this book! I couldn't have asked for a better second installment of Gideon and Eva!ok and if you loved them then no matter what they do in this book... you'll always be a fan.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The authors did an incredible job explaining the chain of events leading to this mission, and the mission itself.  I was concerned about the revelation of inside secrets and spotlight searching, but found neither.  The author was humble and straight forward, even taking the time to address those issues.  I'm proud we have people willing to push themselves so far in an effort to protect and fight for our country.  I have recommended this book to several friends and believe anyone with an interest in reality would enjoy it.  It is very easy to read and difficult to put down!
1577314808|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read ... period! You will see some 1* ratings here because not everybody is ready for the message found on these pages.

It is a 6 week workbook to help you along the way.  :)

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mr. Howey is a very talented writer.  That much is clear.<br /><br />His story is a breath of fresh, literary air in an intriguing but cluttered and mostly unremarkable genre.  Everyone seems eager to write about the strife and turmoil of a wrecked world these days (just look at primetime television), but Mr. Howey's crisp, vivid use of language and metaphor breathe more life into his characters and setting than any tale I've read within a similar vein for some time.  This series is a worthy champion for the post-apocalyptic cause.<br /><br />What isn't yet clear is whether Hollywood will take full notice.  (See Mr. Howey's Huffington Post article dated 5/23/2012 for an explanation of this.)

1423140605|4.0|My oldest son made me read The Lightning Thief a few years ago, and after whipping through that series, he and I both await each new entry into the series with excitement.  I just finished reading it on the Kindle, and the hardcover awaits my son.  So let me start by saying I enjoyed this book almost as much - but not quite - as the others to date.  I enjoy the characters, the mythology, Riordan's ability to portray the ages and culture of the teenage characters.  I loved that the new series (The Heroes of Olympus) brought back favorite characters and the familiarity of the demigod world while still keeping his material fresh with new characters and the introduction of the Roman camp and demigods.<br /><br />In The Lost Hero, I enjoyed having the narrative voice switch from character to character - it made a nice change from the first series and gave insight into more than one character.  Riordan repeated this device in The Son of Neptune, and while it still worked, I never developed the attachment to Hazel and Frank that I had for Jason, Piper and Leo.  I realized that for me, it was because Percy's narrative voice was familiar and overshadowed the others.  I couldn't get \\"into\\" Hazel and Frank because I just wanted to go back to Percy's POV.  So, while I've enjoyed the changing narrative voice, which I think is one of the ways Riordan is distinguishing the second series from the first, it presents some challenges.  And for me, using the different POVs was a challenge that didn't work as effectively in Mark of Athena.<br /><br />As hinted at in Son of Neptune, Mark of Athena brings together all 7 demigods.  So I expected to read chapters from all 7 points of view.  That's not the case.  There are only 4 narrative voices, and I found it distracting from the story to keep wondering when/if I was going to get the other points of view.  I'm first to admit that having seven different narrative voices would probably have been worse.  That probably would have been too frenetic and fractured.  So even though I  was distracted by the \\"missing\\" voices, I'm willing to accept this was probably Riordan's best option.<br /><br />Regarding the other \\"spoilers:\\" I'm not giving anything away.  But I will say that in every previous book, Riordan has satisfactorily concluded a quest within the framework of the multiple-book story arc.  The quest is complete and everyone's together at the end of the book enjoying some well-earned R&R.  That's not *quite* the case in this book.  A goal has been successfully achieved, yes, but it's definitely a departure from the other books in that it's more of a \\"prelude\\" to what will come next.  The end feels more like a stalemate than a celebration.  Think Empire Strikes Back, or even the end of Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring.<br /><br />It's going to be a very long time until the next one!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a really good game. has plenty of fun mini games that will keep u occupyed for a long time. overall WONDERFUL game, especially for free! definitely would totally recommend!
B008SVS3FC|5.0|I wanted to give this a good listen before I reviewed it and I am happy to say that this disk follows John's previous two as some of his best work to date! The Hiatt/Kevin Shirley partnership continues with \\"Mystic Pinball\\" and it delivers some great songs. I'd like to list standout songs but I just love this album from start to finish. John really knows how to take real life experiences and tell a story within a song like no one else. I hope it never ends for Mr. Hiatt because the man is just making some incredible music these days, even if he self admittedly couldn't play the pinball machine itself :)

B008FPZQQU|3.0|Was never that big a fan of ELP but I like their music and appreciate their place in rock history.  Brain Salad Surgery was probably their high water mark.  They sure road the horse that was their few hits to death.  Never owned this particular album so it was a new experience for me to hear it remastered and in 5.1/2.0 higher resolution. For some strange reason not clearly explained in the liner notes, TANK was left off the DVD-A.  That's kinda like false advertising.  Anyway, not impressed with this effort from the band or the record company as deluxe reissue.  I hope Tarkus is better.  Still grooving on my copy of Brain Salad Surgery on DVD-A.

B000FBFN1U|4.0|If you are a fan of this series the twists and turns continue. If you are not, you should be!
B0098VYKSA|2.0|and that's where the positives end.  I can only assume Charlize Theron owed someone a favor, or perhaps has crippling gambling debts.  Kristen Stewart is basically paid in this movie to stand and look at whomever is talking.  She's effectively a soundboard off which the other actors bounce their lines.  The only other positive is that this movie eventually ends.<br /><br />The special effects are nice, and some of the bit characters are fun (if predictable), but overall I'd give this a 1.5 if I could manage to figure out fractional star-ing.  This movie is a great example of why a 10-point scale is needed.  Five-point scales don't provide enough granularity.
0061353248|5.0|Well researched book written as an easy read, you don't need a degree in psychology to enjoy this insightful book, full of logical experiments that most people can understand and draw similar conclusions. Can't wait for the next book from Prof Ariely!
0812992784|5.0|Salman Rushdie's JOSEPH ANTON: A MEMOIR is a triumph of nonfiction, one which lends meaning to the often-vapid form called 'personal journalism'. And well it ought to, given what the author endured during its gestation; for over nine years a 'fatwa', a sentence of death imposed by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini, hung over Rushdie, his family, and all those connected with the publishing of his 1989 novel THE SATANIC VERSES.<br /><br />The novel became an international bestseller, but a dangerous item to be associated with; Rushdie's Japanese translator was stabbed to death, one European publishing executive was shot several times, and yet another was stabbed in the neck. Rushdie himself was forced into hiding, driven from his home and into the protection of Special Branch police teams. (They became close and supportive friends in many cases, and Rushdie's respect and gratitude shine through his account). His dealings with politicians and senior police officials weren't always amicable; Rushdie makes clear his frustration with their assumptions that the threats directed at him were somehow deserved.<br /><br /> He's equally unsparing of himself, and of some of his choices, during the long ordeal; blessed with support from good friends and loving family, he ultimately emerged as a clear-minded spokesman for freedom of speech and intellectual inquiry. Under President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's titular leadership, Iran finally decided it had no interest in pursuing the 'fatwa'. Salman Rushdie was free---and the finale of his book highlights the moment when he emerged, quite to his surprise, from living under constant guard. It's both stunningly anticlimactic and a joyous finale. Highly recommended.
B009B2U73I|2.0|Annette Hanshaw's recording of \\"We Just Couldn't Say Goodbye\\" sounds sweet, swinging and sincere.  Maxine Sullivan's reading of the same song a half-century later was also warm, lilting and convincing.<br /><br />Similarly, Peggy Lee's superb update of \\"There Ain't No Sweet Man...\\" had a contemporary, yet timeless feel.  Peggy got to the guts of the song, mining its blues and jazz roots fully, yet she seemed to be testifying about an incident from her own life.  You believed her; you felt the pull of her varying emotions and her resolve.<br /><br />Diana Krall hits the notes but does not seem to be relating  real experiences; she comes across as being uncommitted to the lyrics, and her versions fall flat.<br /><br />I applaud Ms. Krall for trying to acquaint new audiences with material that deserves to live on, but she does not make the songs come to life; she seems uninvolved and unenthused.<br /><br />In precise terms, she seems like a bored clerk in a record store, telling a customer about a song on an album she has in stock.  She belts out an impromptu performance, to give the customer a rough idea of what the album contains, but she neither tries nor has the capacity to convey the emotion and the excitement of the recordings she's trying to sell.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|Just finished the second book! Keeps you on your toes.... can't wait for the third book!  How much more suspense can she keep us in?  Can't wait to find out.....
0316228532|3.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan and would read anything J.K. Rowling wrote.  But I probably won't be reading this one over and over. It had so many characters, all unlikable, that it took a long time to get into it.  Many of my favorite books have a setting or characters I'd like to revisit.  I didn't find the \\"darkly comic\\" element of this book funny enough to compensate for the fact of nearly all the characters being desperate, whiny, involved in sordid behavior and endlessly thwarted.  I kept wondering what was the author's point in writing this book, since it couldn't be to tell an enjoyable story.  And the horrible details of poverty, drug addiction and various kinds of abuse are all too familiar to anybody who reads the news.  In the last 10% of the book the plot finally started to move along, and some of the characters at the end did get to grow and change.  **SPOILER ALERT**--when certain characters died tragically I was actually relieved, as they had no future and were doomed from the start by the circumstances of their lives (and also the circumstances of the book--it was hard to see how they could sink much lower and this wasn't the type of book where they were going to get a happy ending).  One of these characters was the most sympathetic in the book and only in the last few pages were some anecdotes revealed that added to her humanity.  By the end I thought the author's point was probably to draw attention to the ways in which society fails its most disadvantaged children, and that in an interdependent world this has repercussions for people from other socioeconomic levels.  She accomplished this pretty well but it wasn't new territory, and not the book I was hoping for.<br /><br />My 12-year-old daughter and all her friends were planning to read this book.  I expressly told my daughter no (the first time I've ever forbidden her to read anything) and I hope the others don't either.  I understand that J.K. Rowling feels she has the freedom as an author to write whatever she needs to.  But this book, or what they could understand of it, would be very disturbing to kids that age, and it's a fact of life that some of them are going to go looking for it because they are Rowling fans.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Most books have the usual stereotypes in in that we all read about and believe. But every so often you find a book that breaks all those rules and gives you something magical. The story was great well written and impossible to put down. I'd recommend this book to any  and all fantasy fans.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Although I have not finished this book, - I read only a third of it yet - I can tell you already that it is one of the best books, maybe the best, I read this century. It ranks with the first book of Chaim Potok, 'The Chosen' in bringing all of your emotions to centre on the story. I don't know how the books ends, and certainly many sad things are going to happen, but I want to be there with the parents and with their children, till the very end.<br />The book is very well written, the psychology and thinking of the main character is absolutely convincing. This book leaves other contemporary books that I read (like 'Freedom' from Frantzen) far behind - although this may be my personal taste. In the NRC-paper (a quality Dutch Newspaper) it got 5 stars out of 5, and I agree, totally!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE IT WAS GREAT. I LOVE WATCHING IT. I THINK HIS IS THE BEST BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW SOME PEOPLE NEED HELP AND HOW PEOPLE ARE WILLING TOO HELP THEM THROUGH WHATEVER THEY NEED.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this id a gun game. and great time waster. love the graphics and the shake button!  wish you had more coins yo start.
B000O78KW4|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Die Hard series (not so much the second, but even it merits a look).  It's safe to say that if you see John McClane in a building, airplane, or telephone booth (maybe even a doughnut shop) you better run like heck because said structure will be blown up (or at the least riddled with bullets) within seconds.  Bruce Willis is the ultimate every-day hero with flaws and a biting sense of humor, as he is raised from the bottom of the bottle he has drowned himself in to battle again with an uber-terrorist bent on worldly domination (played deliciously by the always entertaining Jeremy Irons who I feel plays some of the best bad guys in the business).  Sounds too much like the first?  Heck no, because there is a high-octane, adrenaline-packed side kick in the form Samuel L. Jackson (that's Zeus, not Jesus) who provides amusement in the form of his one-line zingers, yet still able to open up a can of self-righteous whoop on the enemy.  It's a virtual feast for the senses with dazzling special effects, a great soundtrack and fast-paced dialogue (what else would you expect from razor-witted Bruce).  The characters are rich, multi-dimensional beings whom you can empathize with, or wonder how depraved they truly can be.  It's definitely a film that you can watch over and over, seeing something new each time you do so.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addicting, love it. it is like playing the one in the arcade. recommend for all ages. the prizes are cute. like the extra coins when not laying.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|ok way to just give it away. its people like you that i hate in this world. thanks. ive been waiting for this book for nearly a year and thts what i hve to find out before the book is even delivered to my kindle?? awesome. anyway, cant wait for it to get to me. hasnt arrived yet..
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I personally feel this installment of the Fifty Shades triology was much better than the first. This book introduced more interesting characters that play a larger role than some characters in the first. The plot was very creative and less predictable than that of the first book. It leaves you craving more and to know what's going to happen in the last step.
1603427244|5.0|I never really knew there were that many ways to cast-on and bind-off. After a couple of less-than-spectacular results on sweater cuffs and collars I decided to expand my horizons and was very impressed with this book. It is organized by type of cast-on or bind-off, which ones compliment each other, for what application they will be used, how they are like or or different from the others in that section and pros and cons for each one. Instructions are very clear and include photographs or illustrations. I definitely recommend this book as an excellent reference and I actually now carry it with my current knitting project as it is small, spiral bound and easily portable.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|something good to pass the time. Reminds me of the boardwalk game when I was a kid. Just not spending $20 to win a $2 toy.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A great explanation for why Christian is the way he is. its a roller coaster ride you will enjoy. Ana is a lucky girl.
B003O86FMW|4.0|the book will hold your interest and it will never be the why you think it is gonna turn out. you must read all three to fully enjoy it
0062060562|4.0|This book will give you a very creepy feeling.  You are reading this book with a narrator that you're not sure you can trust, who also doesn't even trust herself!  As a reader, you have no idea what is real and what isn't.  You're not sure what's important in the book, what's a clue, what's a red herring.  After awhile, you can understand the madness of the narrator......or is she mad???<br /><br />Is she reliable???  That is the question that will haunt you all the way through.<br /><br />Christine wakes up every day as if it is her first day and her last day-because it is!  Years ago, she was the victim of an accident or crime and she suffers from a form of amnesia.  She only remembers her present day.  As soon as she goes to sleep, everything is erased and she wakes up with a blank-slate mind.<br /><br />She soon finds a journal that her psychologist has asked her to keep.  In the journal, she finds a note that days, 'Don't trust Ben'.  Ben?  Her husband and biggest supporter?  What is going on?  Christine has to work at finding out if this note is reliable and if her mind is reliable and if her memories, such as they are, are reliable.  As a reader, you're working just as hard as she is to figure the whole thing out.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book!  I could not put it down.  I loved that I found out everything right along with the main character.  It's like a ball of yarn unraveling....right into the cat's mouth!
B008X8P8A8|5.0|For what it is ..it's pretty dang awesome! I really enjoy the campaign, but wish it were longer. Maybe a future update would add more content..and I'd really like the ability to control alot more units in battle. Or at least increase the amount of soldiers per unit. I mean 2 riders in a cavalry unit is just pointless. Lots of potential with TW:Battles!!

B00493E1GI|5.0|I have read the book and while the movie is more \\"Hollywood\\" than the read, this is a must-see for anyone who has gone through, or is going through, major changes in life.  Inspirational, funny, and romantic.  Do not pass this up!

0525953728|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  Unfortunately, I wish that the author had been able to go into more detail.  However, I do understand that, based upon potential security threats, he could not do so.  I cherish the fact that we have young men and women like him in the Seals, Delta Force to help protect us from evil in the world.  Wish we had something like that to help protect from some of our politicians and the uninformed populace that place them in office.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I liked this app better than Office Calculator Plus for my Kindle Fire (1st generation) because the buttons are much larger.  I find myself irritated the more I use it though for multiple calculations (I.e. adding up the new family budget a la Dave Ramsey style).  For fast very simple math it is good.  I realized also while using it that it does NOT reorient landscape /horizontal when you turn your tablet.  This is frustrating because I often prop my Kindle on the counter while cooking to view recipes and listen to music.  I switch to the calculator for quick math on say doubling a recipe and I have to pick up the case and rotate it to use the app.  It isn't horrible, it is free, and the ads are mostly unobtrusive.  Three stars = average.  Nothing special.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|got this watch a year and a half ago, and loved it.  now the battery dies after 1 mile.  garmin said i should reboot it......  did not work.... i did not know it would cost a small fortune to replace the battery..  now i have a useless 200 dollar watch... would not recomend this watch.
0393088731|5.0|I really hate this book, and all Irvine Welsh books. Why? Because they always have to end. Welsh in my opinion is a very under rated writer. He sucks you into the story, brings the characters to life to a point of prodding the reader to search for the characters while out in the public living life.This is a must read for any Welsh fan.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  Very informative, supports many of my beliefs. My grandson turned me on to this, way to go younger generation!!! Let's take control of our diets and heal.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have this game on 3 different devices.....and it is awesome! I have many friends addicted now also!!! but  wish there was more description of what all the coins and puzzle pieces and prizes mean.
B006VA57CY|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderful show. I like to describe it to my friends as Pride and Prejudice but in the 1910s. I love characters both upstairs and downstairs. It's a costumed drama series with a bit of romance and a splash of humor. The costumes and scenery is amazing. By far one of the best shows I have seen in years. Can't wait til series 3!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a must see for anyone over 50!!  Younger viewers would certainly enjoy it, too, but the message for older folks is invaluable:  Aging is about turning another chapter and seeing what is next in the story--NOT about closing the book and giving up!  With all the great reviews, I was expecting the film to be good, but was delightfully surprised at just how good it was!  With a cast of heavy hitters and a wonderful script, it couldn't lose.  By the end of the movie, I wanted to jump up and go see what I could go out and get into! lol
B007THA4FI|4.0|really a great read, though it takes a while to keep all the characters' lives straight.  Rowling has a great ear for character's voices and I am amazed at how well she is able to represent different personality types, especially the teenagers.  I found it very moving and well written, not at all cliched as some have reviewed it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|tons of fun! just challenging enough to keep you interested. only problem is occasionally  i lose all my progress! but I keep playing anyway. possible to advance without spending money!
0345803485|5.0|I admit, it's not the most plausible story on the face of the Earth but, as fiction, it doesn't have to be.  Is anyone else ripping other fiction authors like this?<br /><br />This story began as Twilight fan fiction so right off the bat, I didn't expect much.  I started the first book and couldn't put it down.  Not for the obvious (the sex) but I really just kind of got roped into what was going to happen, where the story would flow.  I like to finish a story I start so I made it through.  Christian is by all accounts, perfect but - the story is through Anna's eyes.  What is perfection, a huge penis, beautiful eyes, etc to HER, may not be to everyone else.  I did find that the British slang was not in keeping with the story and was distracting.  Anna also rolls here eyes and bites her lip so much that -were I Christian- I would wonder if she had a seizure disorder.<br /><br />Is it a perfect novel? No.  It entertained me, I've read the whole series several times over and still enjoy it.  It's a good book.  I read fiction to be entertained and experience things that are outside of reach in reality.  This book hits the mark for me.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the target demographic is married women over 30 ;)

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog<br /><br />Sylvia Day has done it again.  She can seriously write a sensual and sexy story.  She can also write with a lot of emotion and show us a damaged side to her characters that you can easily connect with.<br /><br />REFLECTED IN YOU picks up pretty much where BARED TO YOU left off.  Gideon and Eva are dating and have been going at it like monkeys, staying mostly at his place after the mess with Cary.<br /><br />This is a difficult review to write because there were many things that I liked about the book and some that I wish I would've liked better.<br /><br />Gideon is hot and dominant and sexy as all hell.  This book will make you fall in love with him all over again, in spite the fact that sometimes I felt like clubbing him over the head.  He's comfortable in a suit and boardroom as well as jeans and t-shirt at a concert.  He's willing to fight for the woman he loves and to keep her by his side.  Although, I have to say that if it had been me throughout the book that he would talk to like he did...I might be in jail for assault charges.  But once things are revealed at the end, all was forgiven.<br /><br />How Eva stood up for him.  My heart broke completely for Gideon when he finally opened up to Eva about his past.  And I just loved that she went on that little rampage and put everyone in their place who had ever messed with Gideon's life.<br /><br />The sex.  Yes, I said it.  The sex.  Because wow, just O.O WOW! LOL  At the concert, in the bathroom, in the limo.  Gideon is a God and he knows what he's doing.  I'm so jealous of Eva.<br /><br />Eva grew a pair of balls towards the end of the book, which I thought was fantastic and made me jump up and down because I was totally on her side and rooting for that to happen.  I had been complaining throughout the book that I wanted her to take more charge and see some growth, and I finally did get that.<br /><br />The storyline in this book was excellent.  There were enough normal conflicts between Eva and Gideon while also having a small mystery element  after Cary gets attacked.  I actually didn't expect that to go down like that.<br /><br />I feel that a measure of healing started happening in this book for both.  And although it seems sometimes things have to get worst before they get better, I can't wait to see where Ms. Day will take us in the last installment of this trilogy.  Anxiously awaiting.<br /><br />Favorite Quotes:<br /><br />~I found myself pinned to the hallway wall by six feet, two inches or hard, hot male.<br /><br />~It was a look that screamed SEX. Hard, deep, endless, mind-blowing sex.<br /><br />~You're the greatest risk I've ever taken.\\" He pressed his lips gently to mine. \\"And the greatest reward.<br /><br />~Gimme that coffee. I want to be caffeinated when I kick your ass.<br /><br />~You know...I love you madly.<br /><br /> ~People get over love. They can live without it, they can move on. Love can be lost and found again. But that won't happen for me. I won't survive you, Eva.<br /><br />*ARC provided by Netgalleyllent.

B008B0QH5S|2.0|Quality opening track, quality closing track, with the rest in-between that mostly fail to make much impression.  Unfortunately, both the opener and closer are mellow numbers that won't climb high on chart if released as singles.<br /><br />My main complaint, though, is on the quality of production and recording.  The instruments sound flat, Neil's vocal anemic and whinny.  Worst of all, when several instruments and vocals come together in chorus, they sound cramped and staticky instead of being rich, lush, with a sense of spacial imaging.<br /><br />Related is that some of the middling tunes sound as if they could have been developed/polished a bit more to bring out the special quality of each tunes, something that should have been done in the production/recording/mixing stage.<br /><br />On the whole, the album sounds like a collection of demos, of not quite release quality.

B007THA4FI|5.0|I inhaled this book as soon as it hit my Kindle.  I did not have the formatting problems mentioned by other reviewers.<br />This is not Harry Potter redux.  Instead, it offers us a close look at the unseen lives of English villagers.  I would compare it to a Miss Marple mystery without the mystery -- with very detailed characters.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|Due to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to see this movie when it was in theaters; so I had to wait until it was released on DVD/Blu-ray to watch it.  The wait was agonizing, because everyone kept raving about how great it was.  Many people were even saying that it was the greatest superhero movie ever made.  Well, I've been a fan of Joss Whedon's work ever since \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\"; so I knew he had it in him.  But the level of fanboy gushing over this movie was so over-the-top that even I was getting a bit skeptical of all the hype.  That is until I was able to watch the movie for myself, and see how spectacular it truly was.  It's a fun ride from start to finish; but it wasn't until the film's final act -- which I watched with a giddy delight that I don't think I've experienced since childhood -- that I finally became convinced that this might actually be the greatest superhero movie ever made.  That climactic battle has to be the most epic thing ever put on film.  Joss Whedon really knocked it out of the park with this one.<br /><br />In addition to Whedon's brilliant screenwriting and directing, this movie has an amazing cast, great production values, and the best special effects I've ever seen.  I'm still in awe of the Hulk (who totally steals the show, by the way), and am completely dumbfounded by how real they made him look.  But all the action and special effects wouldn't be worth all that much if this movie didn't make us care about these characters.  And that all comes down to the writing and the acting.  As a screenwriter, Joss Whedon is rightly known for his witty dialogue; but he is also a master of characterization.  He knows what he needs to do in order to \\"sell\\" a character to the audience so that they have a stake in what happens to that character. By the time we get to the epic battle that takes up most of the last act of this movie, we are rooting for the heroes in a way that we never would have had Whedon not spent the previous hour and three quarters building an emotional bond between the audience and these characters.  But Whedon can't take all of the credit for this.  Much of it must go to the wonderful actors who play these characters.  They really sell it.  These actors were born to play these parts.  I can't even imagine better casting for these roles.  Marvel really lucked out by getting the right people to bring these iconic comic book characters to life on the big screen.  They ought to be very pleased with the final result.<br /><br />In addition to the movie itself, this DVD/Blu-ray set has a number of special features.  I really enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes.  The movie works perfectly well without them; but they do add a bit more context to some of the things that happen in the film.  There's also an audio commentary by Joss Whedon, a gag reel, a featurette about the making of the movie, another one about the cast, and a music video by Soundgarden.  But perhaps the most unusual special feature included on the Blu-ray disc is a short dramatic film that loosely ties in to the plot of the movie.  Of course, it's the movie itself, and not the special features, that really matters.  And this movie is definitely worth having on DVD/Blu-ray.  If you're one of the few people who haven't seen this movie yet, I'd definitely recommend checking it out.  It's a whole lot of fun.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|This book is amazing! It has our 2 wonderful characters in Eva and Gideon still turbulent as ever. I could not put it down. It made me laugh and  left me very teary right through out the book. I don't want to give anything away in my review. I just want  to  say that this is by far my favourite series of any books I have read....truly amazing! Another 3 months till the next installment and I can't wait!!
0307720950|4.0|The latest book from bestseller author and Wired's editor in chief Chris Anderson is dedicated to the Maker Movement, what has been dubbed as the [start of the] third industrial revolution.<br /><br />If you never heard about  Makers, 3D-printing, digital fabrication, Arduino, Kickstarter, and the new DIY movement, then this book is a great start (also check out the article The third industrial revolution by The Economist).<br /><br />As in his previous books ([[ASIN:1401309666 The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More]] and [[ASIN:B0043RT912 Free: How Today's Smartest Businesses Profit by Giving Something for Nothing]]), Anderson does a great job in explaining a nascent trend in an easy language and with plenty of examples. Much of what he writes about is backed by his personal experience and through his access to key actors of the maker movement.<br /><br />The book tells the story of the maker movement and compares it to the previous industrial revolutions, presenting the thesis that this shift in manufacturing could offer a way for the USA (and the Western world in general) to fend off the predominance of China in the production of physical objects. Anderson explains how manufacturing (\\"the world of things\\"), or more appropriately, digital manufacturing, is following the same steps as the Web, which has democratized publishing, broadcasting and communications, into the world of atoms, allowing almost anybody with a smart idea and a little expertise to make those ideas into physical objects.<br /><br />*The Tools of the Maker Movement<br /><br />Anderson describes the basic Maker tools -hardware and software- and their underlying technologies by dedicating a final chapter that describes such tools as:<br /><br />-3D printers -  additive processes like Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) or Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)<br />-CNC (computer numerical control) machines - a substractive technology<br />-Laser Cutters (according to Anderson this is the \\"real workhorse of the Maker Movement [...] they're the digital tool everyone uses first, in part because they're so simple and foolproof.\\")<br />-G-Code (the machine language used by 3D printers, CNC machines and others)<br />-Software like AutoCAD, Adobe Illustrator, Solid Works, Sketchup, TinkerCAD and many others.<br /><br />*Making & Marketing<br /><br />[spoiler]<br /><br />As a marketer, I found interesting the author's reflections on community building and marketing:<br />\\"When you're creating a community from scratch, consider starting it as a social network rather than as a blog or a discussion group. [...] One of the key elements of a successful community is content with broad appeal [...] such rich, engaging content is marketing -- marketing of the community itself, but also of the products that the community has created.

B005LAJ1O0|4.0|Despite its memorably creepy and pulsating title sequence, AMERICAN HORROR STORY is actually shorter on scares than I would have liked. The show's creators, Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk (the creators of GLEE and NIP/TUCK), seemed far more interested in creating a complex narrative and a comprehensive mythos than in genuinely scaring their audience; yet even so, the series is still gripping and stays with you. The show is more than a miniseries than a series, with the episode run forming a narrative more or less complete in itself: a dysfuncional small family from Boston buys a faux-Jacobean mansion in Los Angeles, and discovers not only that it is \\"The Murder House\\" featured in local civic tours of gothic LA but that the many slaughtered occupants in the house cannot rest and can actively menace them. Murphy and Falchuk seem so wound up in going over the top as much as they can in the show's absurdly eventful two-hour pilot that most of the potential for instilling fear in its audience is drained right out. If you make it past about the third episode, however, the show builds up enough narrative momentum so that its elaborate entangling becomes fairly engrossing; and the fact that the Murder House has fairly consistent rules to its haunting (which become slowly revealed as the show works its way to its conclusion) is also quite satisfying.<br /><br />The best thing about the show are the little murderous incidents in the house's past that begin each episode; there's a lot of morbid narrative pleasure to be had in waiting for the former inhabitants to get it, usually as awfully as possible. The supporting actors who make up the various victims and victimizers in the house's history (some of whom remain around it still in the show's present, both living and dead) are some of the best actors working in the United States today, and are more than enough reason to watch the show. Jessica Lange (a deserved winner of the Emmy and the Golden Globe for the show) gets to playthe most complex and fun character, a Virginia-bred neighbor who can turn in a second from honeyed hospitality to poison vindictiveness; she offers basically a Master's Class in Gothic acting, and she's well supported by a number of other superb actors such as Christine Estabrook, Denis O'Hare and Lily Rabe as her fellow walking wounded. Less effective are the actors who play the central Harmon family members who have moved into the house; through some dreadful and shallow creative decision, the Harmons are envisioned as sexy glamorpusses rather than as more ordinary people, and so it takes a while to feel much sympathy for or interest in Dr. Ben Harmon, with his improbably perfect ripped abs, or for his wife Vivien, with her eternally fabulous hair. (When does she even find time to go to the salon between all the hauntings and murder attempts?) The actors in question, Dermot Mulroney and Connie Britton, are both quite fine, but they seem centrally miscast, or at least far too done up and prettified. Fortunately they don't much get in the way of Lange and company (and Britton manages ultimately to turn in quite a strong performance overall).
B008NW67E0|2.0|After breaking out with Sigh No More, Babel shows no growth and maturity with this band.  As others have remarked, this album has songs that sound very similar to the others on the album.  After a while of listening, it's almost like you're listening to one long track.  Babel and I Will Wait are great, but I think collectively, this album takes a major step back from Sigh No More.  It's not terrible, it's just that I expected more from the next album.  I would be very surprised if this album were to take home any big music awards.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|When I first heard about this movie, I thought...ah hah!  Johnny Depp and Tim Burton do Dark Shadows, great!  But then the trailers came out and I wondered if they had flubbed it all up.  I was prepared to be disappointed big time.<br /><br />That being said, I went to the movie after all and enjoyed quite a bit of it.  Much much more than I expected to.  Yes, it had little to do with the tone of the original series (which I also loved) and some of the humor fell flat on occasion.  But the overall look to the movie was fabulous and many of the scenes were really really funny, mostly those that involved Barnabus having to deal with the 1970's.  Well, and some of the scenes were just funny because of looking back at the 1970's in general.<br /><br />Basically, once I stopped expecting it to be the old classic Dark Shadows, I enjoyed it for what it was.  It's like the difference between reading the Sookie Stackhouse books and watching True Blood--they are both different and both good in their own light, but you can't go into them expecting them to be exactly the same.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is the best movie Johnny Depp or Tim Burton have ever done, but it was worth going to see and is worth owning if you want something a bit dark, a bit strange, and a bit campy.  It also made me want to run out and get a lava lamp...

All of the songs on this new CD are about tired, Vegas-desert-trailer-park relationships.  Gone is the glamour and musical variety I liked in the start of their career.  Very disappointed.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|This album is so rich on so many different levels that even after the multiple times I've played it, I'm still discovering new things embedded in it.  The performances by Bob's touring band are top notch, and Bob is also in top form.  He uses his diminished vocal skills in new and thrilling ways, and the lyrics are revelatory for folks willing to really probe their depths.  All of those one star reviewers who claim to love Bob, well, I'm sorry you don't get it.  Your loss.  Some of you (like the reviewer who advised avoiding anything after Blonde on Blonde) would probably prefer Bob to keep recording Like a Rolling Stone over and over and over again.  Thank God he's chosen a more exciting and interesting path.  This is one of Bob's best albums.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This is a dark tale of woe.  There are not many characters in this books that are likeable...but there are moments of hope and light.<br />I recommend that people read this book over the course of a couple of days...<br />If you love to read about human observation, then this is the book for you. JKR does a wonderful job at describing people and the way they act.<br />I have a feeling that most of the people who are reviewing this book negatively are doing so because the novel was so far out of what they had expected.<br />It is a brilliantly woven story involving many characters, there is a tonne of absolutely horrific behaviour, all of which I found to be quite true to the mark, and<br />if you look carefully enough I expect you will find some hope in this story.  I did.  I am not sure where, but having finished reading the book (which is very tragic) I feel strangely optimistic.  That is I suppose the power of JKR's gift.

B002KYHZLQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this.  The magic/sorcery was not overwrought. The supernatural was part of the story, not the story itself.  There was plenty of gritty realism and plot-crossing intrigue.  I will definitely continue reading this series.

B007THA4FI|2.0|JKR is such a good writer, rich descriptions, clever plots and characters that I was simply blown away at how ghastly this book was. To be fair, I simply could not even finish it and I read phone books and cereal boxes if that's all that's handy! This story moves at a snails pace, the characters are dull and lifeless and the theme is tedious. There is a it of \\"language\\" which I don't care about but seemed stilted and unconvincing as if Rowling wanted to convince the reader that she knew big girl words. I am sorry I purchased this book and wish I could return it. Actually I think I will return it!
B0010SEMP0|5.0|This is my favorite book in the series.  Cat is older, wiser and tougher - thanks to the expert training she received from Bones in the first book.  The reunion between Cat & Bones is steamy.  A must read series!  So much fun and the rest of the books get better and better!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Enjoyed this book right up until the ending, at which point the author must have developed writer's cramp because she ended it with no warning and no resolution. It's like she wrote herself into a corner, couldn't figure out what to do, so she simply stopped. Kudos for the creativity and storyline but a big fat F for the ending.

B008N5UX9M|2.0|The only redeeming thing about this disc is the song writing, which isn't bad at all, but that's all that isn't bad.  The production is so poor I wonder if the Caveman agreed to put his name on because he owes Steve his first born and this was cheaper.  The lead singer is weak, has no charisma and sings in an annoying falsetto.  Steve should have marketed this as a pre Maiden high school band demo, hell, even the Sound House tapes sound better.  'Lospher words here so I'll just go drown my sorrows in my work.

B008QE9VJI|2.0|*revised with possible spoilers*<br /><br />When I first heard that Johnny Depp and Tim Burton were collaborating in making a Dark Shadows movie, I squealed like the biggest fan girl ever. Being both a huge fan both Burton and Depp while being a fan of Dark Shadows, I thought I was getting the best of both worlds. When I started to see production photos slowly coming out, I thought they got it spot on, until that trailer came out... Disco music, comedy, really? Still, I went this past Friday into the movie with no expectations..... And lets just say it's not the Dark Shadows your mother grew up with.<br /><br />The movie starts out great with an original story line from the show. Barnabas Collins and his family create Collinwood and Collinsport. He then spurns the love a servant girl named Angelique and falls in love with another girl by the name of Jossette. Angelique, being a witch, curses both of them. Jossette falls to her death and Barnabas is turned into a Vampire. He is then locked away in a chained coffin by angry mod, led by Angelique.<br /><br />Fast forward 200 years. Collinwood and Collinsport still stand. The Collins family still endure with only a couple members remaining: Elizabeth Stoddard and her daughter Caroline, Elizabeth's brother Roger and his son David. There's Willy Loomis, their groundskeeper, Mrs. Johnson, a maid (who served no purpose but to stand around and pretend to be an old crazy person), Dr. Julia Hoffman, David's always drunken slosh psychiatrist, and soon they're joined by Victoria Winters (aka Maggie Evans) who comes on as David's governess. Already, Vicki's character is pushed into the wayside many times in the film, although you would assume she would have a bigger part as being the reincarnation of Jossette. She only appears when it suits Barnabas' scenes.<br /><br />Depp's Barnabas awakens in 1972 by a construction crew building a Mcdonalds. Already starts the downfall from here. Instead of being the serious Barnabas in the opening of the film, Depp plays him as a bumbling fool, all wigged out about all the \\"weird\\" things he sees along the way (the giant glowing McDonalds M, cars, lava lamps, etc.) In the television show, Barnabas had put Willy under control and then seemingly planted himself in place with no issues and charm the Collins family in letting him stay at Collinwood. Never did they know he was a vampire either, as they spill in this movie.<br /><br />Another character dynamic they got all wrong was that of Dr. Hoffman. In the television show, she was a doctor that dealt with studying blood diseases, thus trying to always cure Barnabas of his curse. She was always the voice of concern and did develop a friendship with Barnabas. Helena Carter's portrayal is far from the loving doctor we know, where she is constantly drunk, uses sexual favors to get what she wants and instead of finding a cure for Barnabas, she has other plans on how to use his blood.<br /><br />You find out later on that the Collins are almost broke due to another company called Angel Bay. You can see where this is going. Angel could be short for Angelique maybe? Eva Green did Lara Parker a grave injustice by portraying Angelique as some sad, desperate slut who happens to be a witch. Hilarity ensues, there's conflict, and a big climatic ending.<br /><br />My biggest beef with this film is while it made many references to the television show, Burton and Depp had made this more of a campy comedy rather than a serious soap opera. Granted the television show was know for it's very campy drama and occasional bloopers in scenes. But it still managed to be serious when it needed to be. I think the biggest mistake was to let Seth Grahame-Smith (Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) write the screenplay. He's know for writing humorous spoofs and that's what he did with this. Sure it had it's moments, but to do that through out the entire movie was a mistake. Another thing that was wrong was all the \\"surprises\\" they made. Caroline turns into a werewolf and breaks the third wall, telling not only her mom to \\"deal with it,\\" but her face faces the audience, expecting us to \\"deal with it\\" as well. Okay sorry, I wanted to cry foul and not deal it. It was lame delivery with an even lamer surprise.<br /><br />As a stand alone film (not comparing to the show), I felt it was really bad. It's not Burton/Depp's best work (in comparison to others they have made). It would be last on my Burton/Depp list. The ending was rushed and almost laughable, especially the whole werewolf scene. Most of the theater was busting in nervous and ridiculous laughter. I feel Johnny Depp overacted (as with most of the other actors, mostly Eva Green). Granted most of the characters he does are over the top, but he took this to the next extreme. As briefly stated, the serious scenes did not match the funny ones.<br /><br />The only thing rewarding about this film was the performances of Jackie Earl Haley (Willie) and Michelle Pfeiffer (Elizabeth). Even Belle Heathcote (Victoria) had a great performance, it's a shame they didn't give her more to work with.<br /><br />Out of all the Burton/Depp movies, this one was my least favorite. That's very hard to say, considering I love all of the films they've made over the years. It had so much potential, but they ruined it. I prefer my cheezy soap opera. It's like they made 2 different movies, one serious and one humorous. They should've worked more on it, made it serious and released it on Halloween. Would've been more fitting that way.line turns into a werewolf and breaks the third wall, telling not only her mom to \\"deal with it,\\" but her face faces the audience, expecting us to \\"deal with it\\" as well.

B007MJ9LA2|4.0|Would have bought the CD just for \\"Never The Same Again\\" which my wife and I both enjoy - over and over again. Love that feeling of a Santana adult contemporary instrumental track that makes you want to dance but has feelings to it as if it has a cousin named Samba Pa Ti.  The CD sounds as if it was made to have a little something for everyone - from relaxing world music type tracks featuring guitar crescendos to cutting edge rock on \\"Shape Shifter\\" and \\"Nomad\\", to latin infused \\"Mr. Szabo\\" \\"Macumba in Budapest\\" or \\"Eres La Luz\\" which is sung with conviction and another family favorite that reminds of Supernatural's (Da Le) Yaleo. The wife has her picks and I have mine and we meet in the middle with tracks we both enjoy - something for everyone - that's Shape Shifter. Unfortunately because of that same diversity in tracks - that offers something for everyone - the CD's continuity ability suffers at times causing us to jump tracks or burn our own CD's, which actually is fun when the artist is Santana...  You can have a lot of fun with this album!
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|This movie received terrible reviews and I could never understand why.  I really liked the story frame: Edgar Burroughs wrote this a century ago and it is still fresh today.  Any story that can seamlessly take us from Victorian-era steam powered cities to the Old West to Mars! is worth a night of watching. The exploration of gravity differentials on Mars is fun and creative. The visual artistry is great: alien technologies, and life forms are very creative and amazing. OK, so there is some ho-hum love story and a large part of the plot is left unexplored, but John Carter is an entertaining watch to say the least.

It painted a wonderfully vibrant picture of how hard and with what dedication our American elite forces train and how they then effectively blend into the background.

Very highly recommended read.

Reflected in You takes the characters I loved and goes even deeper and further with their stories.  It's terrific.  I got up in the middle of the night when I woke up and realized that it would be waiting for me on my kindle.  I read it stratight through and now I'm re-reading because I KNOW I missed little clues and plot points in my eagerness to see what happens.  I don't think you HAVE to read Bared to You first, but why wouldn't you want to?  The series is fabulous.
0345803485|3.0|I have never reviewed a book before, but I am compelled to do so here. Admittedly I am behind the ball in picking it up in the first place; however, I caved and here I am. Many other reviewers note the repetition of several phrases, going so far as to count several of them. I was wondering how many times Anna and Christian \\"murmur\\" to one another. This in and of itself, is the one issue that may cause the book to go unfinished. Disappointing given all of the uproar and publicity.

0385344333|4.0|More like 3.5 stars, but I love Lee Child's writing and the Reacher character, with  his observations and asides still enchant. I almost never give a pass to unrealistic situations but somehow when Reacher uncovers byzantine conspiracies and ends up out of touch and out of reach in a Corner of Nowhere despite this being an extremely connected society... I go along. I don't know why I cut Child so much slack. Perhaps it is because I love the \\"Stranger comes to Town\\" trope.<br /><br />I hope Child gets back to more grounded situations. The villains were faceless. We never get to know them. That can work, but here it just makes the conflict oddly bloodless despite all the blood. Also, not really a spoiler, but the \\"eye code\\" used in the book is the silliest thing I ever heard of; a great code and brain-teaser, but never in a million years would it be created or figured out in the situation described.<br /><br />Oddly David Baldacci's \\"Zero Day\\" has been called a Jack Reacher homage, and I find \\"A Wanted Man\\" to be weirdly evocative of \\"Zero Day\\", and I know that is either a strange coincidence... or a conspiracy!<br /><br />One final note on action and violence: way way to little. Reacher never even punches someone in the stomach till near the end of the book. I appreciate that he is a detective unraveling a mystery, but he is a very large, very strong detective who knows how to fight dirty. The best fight is the one you walk away from--- unless you're a thriller writer.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day recounts,firsthand, the Seal 6 mission to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden.  I read it on my kindle. I felt as though I was sitting on Marks' shoulder through out his years of specific trainings and missions. In my opinion,(with no military experience or references to identify with) Mark Owens left no stone unturned. Whether it was dry,hot,wet,cold,dark,or light, you could feel his environment his writing was clear. His missions were difficult, at best, but I could feel his pride, and duty to USA, as a Seal.  I loved the book, and as many movies do...I hated to have the book come to an end. He is the poster child for America...tipping his \\"helmut\\" to those who have come before, and those who paid the ultimate sacrafice.

Maybe this is one of them?<br /><br />The Harry Potter series played to her strengths: wide appeal, simple language, character development. The same qualities that make an engaging children's book, make an adult's novel seem fake (especially the first two).<br /><br />If we wanted J.K. Rowlings to write stuff like Nora Roberts or one of the other adult authors, don't you think those would have sold?
B0034G4OYK|5.0|What a fun and heartfelt film Hotel Transylvania was when I recently attended a screening whereby producer Michelle Murdocca (Open Season 2, Stuart Little) explained, \\"Executive producer and star, Adam Sandler did an amazing job joining this production late in its original inception. It took some 10 years to get this project in theatres,\\" who herself was on the project from the beginning.<br /><br />Russian born director Genndy Tartakovsky (Star Wars: The Clone Wars) says, \\"It was a fun an amazing challenge to get this going and it was a real different environment working with a larger studio.\\" His attention to the details made this film work from page to screen.<br /><br />The story centers around a place where all monsters can go to be themselves. Naturally walking around, celebrating anniversaries, eating as they do, sleeping the way they do, even swimming in pools and enjoying a night of fun and partying. The place (a really creepy castle) was built by Dracula himself (voiced amazingly well by Adam Sandler (Click, Bedtime Stories)) and because of an early accident due to the fear that monsters have toward humans, a tragic accident leaves him to be a single father. Raising and `protecting' his daughter from the outside world.<br /><br />Mavis, his daughter, who is sharply voiced by Selena Gomez (The Wizards of Waverly Place, Another Cinderella Story) reaches her 118th birthday and decides she needs to see the world because of the sheltered life her father has created for her. Due to a series of mishaps and bad turn of events a `lie' goes very wrong and she soon realizes what she has been hidden from.<br /><br />In steps a real human, quite by accident, Jonathan, played by Andy Samberg (SNL, That's My Boy), wanders his way into the hotel. Yet another lie, Dracula tries to cover his true human self and pass Jonathan off as a `real' monster. Another thing that Dracula didn't see coming was the moment that Mavis and Jonathan meet and their eyes connect, you guessed it, the real magic of the heart happens.<br /><br />The screenplay by Peter Baynham (Borat, Bruno) and Robert Smigel (SNL, You Don't Mess With The Zohan) does something that most live-action screenplays try to achieve but never do,  it mixes some great fast paced visual gags with a real heart and real believable story. This movie is about a father and daughter relationship as well as misconceptions we all carry with us based on really never checking things out for ourselves.<br /><br />This film has a great line-up of really hysterical characters including; Frankenstein voiced by Kevin James (King of Queens, Hitch); Mrs. Frankenstein Wanda voiced by Molly Shannon (Superstar, Analyze This); The Wolfman Wayne voiced by Steve Buscemi (Boardwalk Empire, Grown-Ups) and his wife Eunice voiced by Fran Drescher (The Nanny, Beautician and the Beast); The Mummy Murray voiced by CeeLo Green (Kung Fu Panda, Kick Ass) and playing the hunchback Quasimodo is the voice of Jon Lovitz (Big, A League of Their Own).<br /><br />Great for the Halloween theme and in full 3-D, this film was amazingly funny, and full of great classic-style sight gags that you'll probably need to see it more than once to catch them all. \\"I took a lot of time to make sure this film worked on all levels. From the script to the performances and even the technology in making it,\\" says the director Genndy . And you can really see it on screen!<br /><br />What makes this animated feature by Columbia Pictures so good, is that it has a very big heart and an extremely relatable story to go with it. The whole family will really enjoy this film!t, the real magic of the heart happens.<br /><br />The screenplay by Peter Baynham (Borat, Bruno) and Robert Smigel (SNL, You Don't Mess With The Zohan) does something that most live-action screenplays try to achieve but never do,  it mixes some great fast paced visual gags with a real heart and real believable story.

B008RV5K5E|5.0|I have been an avid collector and fan of all the DC Universe animated features from the beginning, but none of them hold a candle to the latest release The Dark Knight Returns Part 1. Split into two parts, TDKR P1  tells the story of a future Gotham City where the Batman has retired and the city is being overran by violence and crime once again. Bruce Wayne now tries to hide from the demon that is the mantle of the Bat and suppress his need to right the wrong. Bruce eventually gives in to his true-self and the Batman returns to bring those who would threaten the innocent to justice, something he does in a surprisingly violent (for a cartoon) way. The animation is top-notch, and it is exciting to see that we are getting an improvement on these films on every release. Frank Miller originally wrote this masterpiece back in the eighties. A time when comic books were near extinction, Miller decided to turn the tide with a violent and dark story that brought the Batman, and comic books into a new era. Warner Premiere's release is not only the best of the bunch but also the most loyal to the source material. With a few tweaks here and there, ones that can easily be overlooked, The Dark Knight Returns is bright look into the future of what the genre is capable of entertaining us with. As usual there are two episodes from the vault of previous DC animated show, on this disc 2 episodes from Batman: The Animated Series which are Two-Face centric. Also on the disc is a 45-minute documentary about Bob Kane, a sneak peek into The Dark Knight Rises Part 2, and some trailers. Nothing to get overly excited for, I am actually very disappointed that we are not getting any more DC Showcase shorts, the real treat is waiting for part two to be released in early 2013!<br /><br />I give this movie a 9/10, I can't wait to see this film as a whole, especially the battle with you know who.<br /><br />Stay tooned :P<br /><br />~CynicNerd
B008KEQMDC|1.0|I didn't expect much but I think this is the new low for Hollywood. There was one reason I can't call the movie boring: I was on the edge of my seat to find out if this complete drifting between different scenes and characters without any point or entertaining value was real and when it would turn into an actual movie. It never did. They didn't even bother to connect the \\"stories\\" together, and when they did, it was just stunningly stupid, two characters happened to be related and in the same building.<br /><br />I have nothing against pregancy, with children of my own, and finding birth a miracle and all that but showing various women growing throughout their pregancy and then delivering the baby is not a story. You actually have to add something to it to make it one. I seriously hope this is the bottom of the hole for Hollywood and they can't go any lower.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|iv been waitin FOREVER for this book!!!!! but my acount doesnt hv a credit card and evn tho i can buy it it still says its a pre order so i can only get the FREEKING SAMPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000HF6XV8|5.0|This 1993 version of The Secret Garden is a superbly directed, superbly acted movie about a neglected young girl who is spoiled and angry and goes to live with her wealthy uncle in England after her parents die in an earthquake in India.  Kate Maberly grabs the screen and keeps it in a tight grip throughout the movie; you just can't look away from her character, Mary Lennox, for a moment.  The other child actors in the movie are also exceptionally good actors, and they bring their characters to vivid life on the screen.  Among the adults, Maggie Smith makes an impressive Mrs. Metlock, who is the housekeeper.<br /><br />The movie is about Mary finding a closed-down garden which belonged to her aunt, who died in an accident ten years before Mary came to live on the estate.  She begins to bring the garden back to life by caring for the plants.  Then she stumbles upon Colin, her uncle's son, who is a hypochondriac convinced that he is going to die young.  Mary convinces the boy to join her in the secret garden, where they tend the plants together.  Colin slowly grows stronger.  They are joined by a second boy, Dickon, who has a gift with animals and is always in the company of animal friends.  These three are inseparable.  Mary slowly becomes a better person by helping others, and Colin gives up his unnatural fears of death and disease as he grows healthy and strong.  The plot arc of the movie is a very satisfying one, and the director does a brilliant job of showing the characters' growth throughout the movie.  I heartily recommend this movie to both children and adults; as a family feature it is rousing and most pleasing to the spirit.
B005FISBTO|3.0|This season didn't get interesting until past the half way point.  It wasn't nearly as good as the previous 2 seasons with Julia Stiles and John Lithgow, although the cliff hanger ending was excellent!
0525953728|5.0|Thank you Mark Owen. No Easy Day was a very intriguing and interesting book. I wanted this book to document and go along with the newspaper articles of the attacks that occurred on that day, September 11, 2001 that I purchased and saved. I wanted my grandchildren and their children to be able to read about it and know what happened as this is history. It was a good clean account of what went on and shows the dangers that our servicemen are in to protect us, not just that day but any day. If there was a way to have my book autographed, I would have it done.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have now read all three of the fifty shade books. With the first book I was not as impressed with it as I thought I would be with all the high reviews that some of my friends gave this boook. When the true story came out the book was good. But I felt that it was a slow start to get to a good ending.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A friend loaned me THE NAME OF THE WIND and I couldn't put it down.  Then I bought it because.....I knew I was going to want/need to reread it.  Then I bought the sequel immediately THE WISE MAN'S FEAR.  All I can say is:  I can't imagine not getting any book by Patrick Rothruss as soon as it comes out.  It is always a wonderful experience to encounter a great new fantasy writer.  And he is definitely one of the best now writing.
0385344333|3.0|I have read all of Child's books and they seem to be getting a little stranger each time.  this book stars off very boring for mthe first 100 pages.  So much so that I almost put it down.  I have never done that with a Childs book before.  the middle of the book became entertaining and enjoyable.  Then it got bizarre.  Really bizarre.  When a book ends and I wish there were a few hundred more pages because I enjoyed it so much, that is my idea of a great book.  This was definitely not a book that I I hop[ed continued on.  Happy to end it.  Actually 3 stars is a stretch.

B0028IDXDS|3.0|So I thought this would be my saving grace to not have to endlessly go in and constantly reinsert the pacifier. It helped a little, but only when I propped it up with another wubbanub pacifier.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|I just can't stop playing, even when I stop playing I keep thinking how to solve it.  Level one, the 6th puzzel is the the key.  without instructions is at first frustrating but this is what keeps me coming back, to see if I can solve the next puzzel.  Keep making new updates.  I plan on solving all 90 levels.  What fun!!!
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|Please listen to everyones advice on here, and DO NOT buy this product. shorted out within first or second week, but still worked if put in certain position so i never returned it because i did not have the time. slowly got worse and worse, and now does not work at all. there are better options out there, get the one that is just an hdmi cable with a mini display port on the other end of the cable. works brilliantly.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The best one yet! Can‘t wait to read the next one! Freaky or not everyone needs a man like that.
B008IJTFYW|1.0|this the worst app ever come on u should put it were we don't have to stay on that one page seriously birding y'all
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is the best TV series ever. I love so much how it brings all the story tales together making them all link in some way is the best idea anyone could ever have had. It always keeps me guessing what is going to happen next. It truly feeds my imagination. I've never really been into a tv series, where I'm like oh my what is going to happen next and what I can't wait it the next episode or season. Best Tv series ever by far.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|Such I LOVE THIS FLICK & couldn't wait to buy it on blu-ray..NOW NOT going to with This lame 1.85 ratio release. That's not damn widescreen & theater releases on bluray format!Should be 2.35 ratio widescreen<br />I would just see it as rental worth NOTING MORE!
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great way to pass time.  I find myself playing for hours and putting the game down just to pick it up again
0525953728|5.0|No East Day was Great book. I am not a big reader, but this book captured my attention and the pages kept turning. I couldn't wait to read what happened next.  Highly highly recommend this book.
0061537934|5.0|I am a life long pet owner, particularly dogs, so I grabbed this book right after \\"A Dog's Purpose\\". I loved both of them for what each said to me. Different, but very similar.  I, at one time, had a large website of Pet Loss tributes, resources, and I still am sensitive to that issue. I especially loved this book, because it was about an adult man, loving his dog. I know most probably do, but this relationship especially struck me. It was written with emotion and heart attached to each page. When I first read the title \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" I thought it would be about a dog racing joyfully in the rain, not car racing, and in the end, that is exactly what it was about! Buy and read this book today!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I bought book one with hesitancy because of the reviews.  I found myself through book one in a day, and purchase this book on day two and then book three was bought and finished in less than a week.  I couldn't put it down.  I got lost into the life of Christian and Ana.  I typically will read motivational books for my business.  This certainly was a nice change and I appreciated the ability to get lost in the story.
B008M87GJK|3.0|I enjoy watching BBC World News on PBS so I purchased the app for my Kindle.  Its ok.  They don't change the stories everyday, so its kinda boring.  I do like reading how other countries view the US and see what other countries are experienceing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great HOT series!!! May be a little over the top for the \\"prudish\\". What a turn on and a great story to go with it. Written porn with class!!!
B004SDEP38|1.0|Every button on this free app just leads to the prompt to buy the $15 version. really not even worth being free.
145168939X|1.0|This was not what I expected. I never read a Don Delillo book. I don't think I will read another any time soon. It was difficult to follow, strange, and weird at times. It reminded me of a Quinton Tarantino type story (I love Tarantino films), but without the suspence and direction. I found it to be dull, even boring. I may watch the movie out of curiosity once it is available for free, but I won't pay to see it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Omg just as good as the first can't believe have to wait two more months for last. Even better than Shades of Grey!
0345803485|1.0|When a book like this so childish and stupid becomes a runaway best seller this is an indication of the kind of world we live in...Now I see the rights to the book have been sold for 5 million dollars for a movie.  Hell, people have so little time for sex as it is and now this infantile little book is going to convince women that they should have Grey in their life until their clits fall off.<br /><br />Fifty shades of hallucinations would be a better title.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is the best book I have read lately. I liked this book so much that I went on to read the second and third books.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It is a unigue  book to read.  This book is not meant for kids under the ages of 20 in my book. It is really graphic throughout the whole book. All the books are for the adults only.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the variety of games! This game never gets old. I would have given it 5 stars but the controls on a hand full of the games don't seem to work correctly.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book is very interesting.  It explains in great detail about the relationships of Katniss, Peeta, Gale and other characters in the book.  It was a very nice continuation from the first book.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining shows on television.  If you love Zombies you cant go wrong with this.  Great storyline and special effects.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I'm happy the Pinterest app is finally available on my Kindle. I use this app often. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because it sometimes needs to force close or might take a little longer to load search results.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Blake Crouch takes the reader on a creepy, thrilling ride in Pines. There are numerous memorable scenes involving a protagonist that you like and want to root for as he faces considerable, sometimes seemingly insurmountable challenges. I read the Kindle version in four or five sittings and felt like the action made the pages turn themselves. All in all, an enjoyable thrill ride for this reader!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is amazing, if you haven't read the first book i totally recommend it you will fall in love with the characters, as well and the story plotted around them it's just amazing and this book doesn't stay behind, I love it very much cant wait for the next to be out in Dec. READ I PROMISE YOU, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|the book was a good read i am glad it ended the way it did.David found himself  it made the nook a good read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well written and there is no critical intelligence revealed in the book. Started to share the the book with family members. This is second book read on special forces of USA in action. Proud of these men for their sacrifices.
B00866H7SS|1.0|Better written than Fifty Shades of Grey?! Kidding, right?<br /><br />I'm mystified as to why people are making that declaration. EL James created characters with... well, character. Even if some of the grammatical structure and plot development in FSOG were less than exemplary, the characters were quite believable and the dialogue was relatively engaging, provided you weren't expecting Shakespeare (and, seriously, who of us was - other than those who started reading with the jaundiced eye of a try-hard, high-brow literary critic?). On the other hand, Sylvia Day has created two-dimensional knock-offs that fail to hold the attention of the reader (or this one, anyway), to the point that Eva and Gideon became seriously annoying cardboard cut-outs who lacked any credibility for their actions. There was so little character development and well-constructed tension between the hero/heroine that I was confused when they were suddenly mauling each other in the back of the limo and making decisions that were at odds with their usual MO. Edward was initially frustrated by Bella because he couldn't read her mind, then enthralled by her refusal to be intimidated by him; Christian initially lusted after Ana because she was his 'type' and then she became his obsession when he found out he was her 'first'; exactly what makes Gideon fall for Eva I never did figure out (other than she had a pretty face, but given he was surrounded by those, who really cares?).<br /><br />I enjoyed the Twilight series (despite Breaking Dawn) and loved FSOG, so of course I'm keen to see similar stories - but PLEASE if you're going there, at least do a decent job of it; because, like many others, I'm quickly getting over the multitude of very poorly contrived knock-offs.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Hard to put down.  Graphics are nice too.  Well worth the money.  I use this on my Kindle Fire HD.
B0025KVLU6|1.0|these guys suck! they are just 4 irish noobs (one died in 1966, a second committed suicide in 1980) who got sick of eating potatoes & cabbage and decided to try to make \\"music\\" instead. this sorry bunch of \\"musicians\\" clearly had no taste - why did they leave the album cover blank?! the worst part is that they couldn't even spell their band name right - it's supposed to be spelled b-e-e-t-l-e-s
B002N2P1SE|5.0|You know, I'm glad this show was limited to two seasons.  I'm tired of sci-fi series that drag on and on without reaching resolution. (I'm looking at you, Lost and X-files.)  Having only two seasons to work with kept the writers honest in my opinion.  They didn't have to flop about looking for ways to extend the series, but instead could focus on telling Echo's story.<br /><br />Again, the plot-of-the-week was nicely interwoven with the overall plot arc.  Season two features all the strengths of season one, and adds on a number of revalations.  Some I saw coming, some left me agape and applauding the audacity of the writing.<br /><br />The ensemble cast and the guest-star appearances were again great.  My favorite guest-star is probably Ray Wise (sorry, Summer).  Leland effing Palmer himself!  Ahhh, joy.<br /><br />If Mr. Whedon again gets a Fox contract I hope that a) they just flat-out limit it to two seasons, and b) find someone who can come up with a non-crappy name for the title!  Kudos to everyone involved for a great take on a classic sci-fi theme.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|Fun little time waster. Fairly simple concept but definitely not easy. When it gets going fast as the level gets higher, it becomes quite difficult to add on the fly.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I don't do many reviews and I read a LOT of books but I felt that I had to add my voice to the praises of this work. I took a chance on this book based on reviews alone. You should to...  The character development is as extraordinary as the story weaving. Almost none of the standard cliche's are here in what is truly exceptional writing. This is [[ASIN:0886773687 Armor]] on horseback.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|What this guy experienced and survived is absolutely amazing. I can‘t even imagine becoming a functional member of any society after what he endured.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Exciting movie .. Can't wait for the second one .. You don't have to have read the book to enjoy the movie.
0345803485|2.0|I'll be brief.<br />1. The vocabulary is si British - eg keen, shall, lovely. I didn't get the point of the Seattle setting<br /><br />2. The initial character building for Ana doesn't provide explanation for why Christian would be attracted to her, or she to him.<br /><br />3. There is way too much \\"murmuring\\".<br /><br />4. Both lead characters are annoying and shallow.<br /><br />5. The writing was so unengrossing I at times skimmed.<br /><br />I read this book bc I wanted to know what all the brouhaha was about. Nothing much except for mainstreaming S&M.
B008N4XC2I|4.0|Muse's follow up to The Resistance is interesting. Featuring scientific-apocalyptic lyrics and haunting riffs, it is definitely worth a listen.<br /><br /> The album begins with a massive track entitled \\"Supremacy,\\" which might be their best track since Black Holes and Revelations' \\"Knights of Cydonia.\\" It has a spy-movie theme feel to it with the dark, melodic lyrics (\\"You don't have long - I am on to you\\") and the \\"New Born\\" and \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\"-esque guitar riff. In fact, Dom Howard (the drummer) has stated that he thinks this track should be the theme for the new 007 movie (but apparently Adele is doing it).<br /><br /> The next track on the album is \\"Madness,\\" which was the second single off this album (after \\"Survival\\"). At first, I didn't know what to think of this song. I could either love it for it's catchy vocals and it's simplistic instrumentation, or I could hate it for it's electronic atmosphere. I've grown to love it. It has harmonies and a solo similar to Queen, and Matt Bellamy sings with great emotion at the end of the song (\\"I need to love\\").<br /><br /> \\"Panic Station\\" immediately comes on after \\"Madness\\" with a funky feel that you would think would have a clavichord. Two members who worked on Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\" are featured on this track playing horns. Muse has ventured into a genre that they haven't touched before with this track. \\"Panic Station\\" is one of my favorites on the album, and I predict that this song will be the next single.<br /><br /> After \\"Panic Station,\\" the prelude to \\"Survival\\" starts playing. The prelude is basically a short string arrangement that is quite similar to The Resistance's \\"Exogenesis\\" suite. It's not bad, but Bellamy's orchestral arrangements are getting predictable. The prelude then segues into the first single, \\"Surivival.\\" I am not very fond of this song, and honestly, it just doesn't fit on this album.<br /><br /> Following \\"Survival\\" is \\"Follow Me.\\" Bellamy has described this song as a lullaby, as it was written for his kid. The track is filled with inspirational lyrics, but in my opinion, it loses it's charm as soon as the synth and electronic drums kick in. There's something about the \\"fake\\" instruments that make the song less effective.<br /><br /> As soon as \\"Follow Me\\" is over, \\"Animal\\" starts with a mellow keyboard riff and a calming guitar noodling in the background. This is also one of my favorites on the album, but it seems as if Muse is plagiarizing their OWN music. The chorus of this song is almost identical to the chorus of Origin of Symmetry's \\"Screenager.\\"<br /><br /> Then come the two worst tracks on the album, \\"Explorers\\" and \\"Big Freeze.\\" Every review I have read on the 'net that mentioned these songs have stated that these are the low points on the album. To me, \\"Explorers\\" is just a boring lullaby-type song with no real reason to come back to it. \\"Big Freeze\\" is a blatant U2 ripoff. Just listen to it so I don't have to explain.<br /><br /> \\"Save Me\\" comes on with delayed guitar and mesmerizing vocals. But wait, who is singing? Chris Wolstenholme, the bassist, sings on this one. This is a good song, but I feel that it drifts away during the chorus. The next track, \\"Liquid State,\\" begins with extremely distorted bass (think \\"Hysteria\\") and a tight drum beat. Then, the vocals come on. Chris sings this one also? A member of Muse who hasn't sung lead before has two tracks on this album, played after one another? Okay then.<br /><br /> After \\"Liquid State,\\" the two final \\"tracks\\" on this album, \\"Unsustainable\\" and \\"Isolated System\\" come on. \\"Unsustainable\\" begins cliche Muse orchestral arrangements, then news anchors start speaking about how the economy is \\"Unsustainable.\\" The part of this song that has generated a lot of talk is the \\"dubstep\\" part. I think that part doesn't fit on the album, and Muse created a lot of unnecessary fear about the album. \\"Isolated System\\" follows \\"Unsustainable\\" with more news anchors talking, and a repeating piano riff similar to Hullabaloo's \\"The Gallery.\\" I don't know what to think of these tracks, as it really ends abruptly with no lyrics or anything.<br /><br />The first half of the album is very good, but as soon as \\"Explorers\\" starts, I feel the album loses momentum. The sequence of the tracks could be improved, too. Two songs which feature Chris Wolstenholme on lead in a row? Really? The album doesn't flow well, considering the multiple genres it spans.  If you are a Muse fan, you should definitely check The 2nd Law out. Though it is not a new Origin of Symmetry, I think it is better than The Resistance.

B000SEIK2S|4.0|Good, satisfying read in the style of a techno-thriller in space. Could have been a bit longer, if anything. Keeps you wanting to read more.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I really liked this book, it was intriguing and had me guessing til the very end.  I read Gone Girl and loved it as well, so I had to try this book too.  I was not disappointed.  It has the same raw feel and intense emotion that I enjoyed so much from Gone Girl.  I like my books to be a bit cringe-worthy and pack a bit of a bite.
B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|Prolific director Steven Soderbergh has made so many great movies - \\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape,\\" \\"Erin Brockovich,\\" \\"Traffic\\" and more - and a few bad ones. Whatever he makes, he brings in something new into the material, and \\"Haywire\\" is no exception. It is stylishly shot. It avoids loud music and big effects. It has some authentic martial arts action stunts. It has a mouth-watering cast that includes Michael Angarano, Antonio Banderas, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, Mathieu Kassovitz, Ewan McGregor, Bill Paxton and Channing Tatum. And it is boring. Yes, \\"Haywire\\" has styles, but that doesn't mean it is a great movie.<br /><br />\\"Haywire\\" is about a vengeful black ops agent Mallory Kane played by Gina Carano. This is basically an action movie template that is used differently. The lead is Mallory, a strong female agent. The car chase ends up in an unexpected fashion. The rooftop chase sequence unfolds more slowly (and realistically) than those of usual Hollywood blockbusters. I see the point. Still I must say the film is dull.<br /><br />For the film's story goes nowhere. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, whose penchant for experimental film techniques is well known among filmgoers, \\"Haywire\\" goes back and forth in time, showing bits of action here and there, giving us clues as to what happened and is happening. The unique narrative method of deconstructed storyline, that was effectively used in \\"The Prestige,\\" does not work in \\"Haywire,\\" of which script is made up of a hackneyed origin story and recycled ideas.<br /><br />Another disappointing thing about \\"Haywire\\" is the heroine Mallory Kane herself. Gina Carano can do action (as seen in the film's thrilling martial arts combat scenes), to be sure, but her acting needs to be worked on.<br /><br />It is reported that the director wanted to create \\"a Pam Grier movie made by Alfred Hitchcock.\\" Well, I see what the director is trying to do, reinventing the espionage-action genre, but Pam Grier has never been dull,and neither is Alfred Hitchcock, master of suspense whose stylish touch never bored us.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|One of the very best in the genre. Max Brooks covers all the bases with this novel. A must-read for those who love, hate, or love-to-hate zombies.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child provides the reader a thinking man, an anti  hero with nothing to lose who moves about the country helping people in hard times. Reacher is a tough guy, and does not suffer fools lightly. Still, he has a certain style that reminds us of the old Travis McGree series by John MacDonald. An excellent read. I enjoyed the A Wanted Man. His words race off a page.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book gave more attention to characters that had been minor characters in the earlier books and added more color and depth to the entire series. It also went into more detail about places that had previously only been mentioned by name.  It whet my appetite for the final book in the series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was incredible.  Parts were predictible, but so well written that I honestly didn't care.  I cannot wait for the next book!  I'm so in love with Gideon it's not even funny.  At this point, it's not even comparable to 50 shades, although I enjoy both series.  I was not disappointed in the slightest by this follow up!

B008LZHA3G|4.0|I have effortlessly listened to \\"Tempest\\" in its entirety twice this morning.  I was a little surprised to learn how long the album is--68 mins. plus.  Dylan's previous effort (\\"Together through Life\\") only clocked in at 45 mins., and it took me a few weeks to get around to listening to all of its ten songs.<br /><br />Although I don't believe \\"Tempest\\" is equal to \\"Love and Theft,\\" it is definitely a stronger, more enjoyable, and scarier album than the two studio albums in between (\\"Modern Times\\" had good moments, but was an overall disappointing follow-up to \\"L&T\\").<br /><br />Oh, as for the \\"cowboy Vincent Price\\" title,\\" the song \\"Pay in Blood\\" may be Dylan's most vicious lyric to date (which I know is a bold statement), and his delivery is genuinely frightening.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Wow. I am completely wrecked and at such a loss for words. Sylvia Day has rocked my world with Reflected in You and I honestly don't know where to go from here. My heart is beating fast as I wipe the tears from my eyes. Words just can't express how I feel. When I say that this book is amazing, I mean it. It was a roller coaster ride and is definitely not for the feint of heart.<br /><br />If you have read the previous book in the Crossfire trilogy, Bared to You, you know that the relationship between Gideon and Eva is tumultuous and intense. The both love each other so fiercely, yet both have so much damage and insecurities that they have to wade through. Reflections in You picks up directly where Bared to You left off and with it we are still on the emotional roller coaster that is Eva and Gideon. Both are still working towards being together despite their dark and damaged pasts.<br /><br />There are so many ups and downs with the two that sometimes it might feel a bit much but it makes complete sense for these two characters. When I say they are effed up, they are seriously effed up. Both are just trying the best they can. They are constantly being thrown one obstacle after another and and you as the reader are waiting to see if this is the thing that will finally break them.<br /><br />The way these two feel for each other as well as the way the react to one another is electrifying. It jumps off the page and slaps you in the face. It makes you root for them and as a reader you wish desperately for them to get their well deserved HEA. I found myself gripping the edge of my seat with worry for these two. I believe in their love for each other and I find that I will follow these two anywhere their relationship takes me.<br /><br />Sylvia Day has another winner with Reflected in You. She just has a way of implanting you into this story and making it feel so raw and real. Not only does it feel real, but I'm left with such an intense desire for more. January can't come soon enough for me. I am desperate for more Gideon and Eva and I can't wait for what I am sure will be an exciting conclusion to the Crossfire series.soon enough for me. I am desperate for more Gideon and Eva and I can't wait for what I am sure will be an exciting conclusion to the Crossfire series.
B003M5AXN4|4.0|The movie as a whole is a really good movie, I enjoy the movie it isn't a movie that I watch once or twice and maybe never watch again. To me though it really shines when it comes to the visuals especially on Blu Ray because the colors really pop and just look even more incredible.

B005LAII80|1.0|OK. I'm coming out of Amazon-review retirement to write this.<br /><br />I'm a huge Judge Dredd fan. I discovered the character in the `80s when Eagle Comics reprinted the British 2000AD Judge Dredd stories in comic-book form for the American audience. To my delight I discovered the essence of Judge Dredd: shocking violence mixed with wonderful comedy. It was something really new. Dredd became, and remains, my favorite comics character.<br /><br />Basically, I think DREDD stinks, because it ignores the essence of the character.<br /><br />People have asked me which is the better Dredd film--the unfortunate version starring Sylvester Stallone, or this humorless blood-and-guts fest. My answer? The best Judge Dredd film was ROBOCOP.<br /><br />ROBOCOP captured the character of Judge Dredd beautifully--a humorless law man/machine in a hilariously insane future, fighting hilariously insane bad guys. The jokes in ROBOCOP were Judge Dredd jokes. Those of us who understood the tone of the film burst into laughter while others were offended. [By the way, DREDD seems to contain a nod to ROBOCOP, as Dredd gives some baddies \\"fifteen seconds to comply.\\" This was the joke that first stunned ROBOCOP audiences, who found them/ourselves laughing and screaming at the same time.]<br /><br />If they wanted to throw some lame characters and a lame storyline together just to push the limits of cinematic violence, they should have named the character Judge Bludd and been done with it.<br /><br />Someone once said the great thing about Judge Dredd is, he doesn't know the joke is on him. He moves straight ahead from one case to the next, battling Mean Machine Angel [who has a dial on his head that makes him more and more violent--\\"I'm goin' up to four on ya, Dredd!\\"] and the Dark Judges, led by Judge Death, the ghostly menace who rents an apartment from a little old lady too blind to notice that he's a demon from another world. Judge Dredd takes them all on without once cracking a smile [or removing his helmet, even when he's in a hospital bed.]<br /><br />Oh yeah, the helmet gag. Stallone had to pull his off at the first opportunity, but the DREDD Judge Dredd keeps his on. A joke-non-joke nobody gets.<br /><br />In the wonderful world of Judge Dredd the comic, we're in on the joke, and the joke's on Dredd. In the world of DREDD, the joke's on us. And it's not funny.r removing his helmet, even when he's in a hospital bed.]<br /><br />Oh yeah, the helmet gag. Stallone had to pull his off at the first opportunity, but the DREDD Judge Dredd keeps his on.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and I want to thank everyone involved for sacrificing so much for this country.  I think all the hype around this book is unjustified.  I've read numerous war and special forces books and this was no different. I thought he paid respect to all he served with in an honorable fashion. I highly recommend.
0451232852|5.0|What a fantastic book but what else would you expect from Ken Follett. Well researched, brilliantly told; one of those books you just can't put down.  It sweeps across continents, draws you into family life and keeps you wanting to turn the pages. I have recommended this book to friends and family. If you like an amazing story that keeps you engrossed from the first to last page, this is the one for you.

B007I1Q4W2|1.0|How did this flick get the \\"Bloody Disgusting Selects\\" insignia?  What was \\"bloody disgusting\\" was the fact that this was the S-L-O-W-E-S-T zombie flick I've ever seen...I had to fast forward on a number of occasions.  Every scene lasted three times longer than it should have.  This could have been released as a 30-minute vignette...not 114 minutes.  Don't get me wrong...it definitely had its high points but it was not a \\"Bloody Disgusting\\" zombie flick.  This passes as PG for me.  Deceptive trailers and advertising agitates me.  \\"Exit Humanity\\" is definitely a film you may \\"exit\\" before it ends.

B007NZDES0|5.0|Ahhhh... Sade, her name alone speaks to my inner sense of beauty, taste, and style that makes listening to her music-and that special quality of her voice that some have described as 'smoky', sultry, whatever, an continually unique experience, no matter how many times I hear her sing. I love her performances because she doesn't over-do anything, yet, offers what comes across as a private part of herself, which, personally, I feel has always been the very heart of her appeal.  EXCELLENT concert DVD

Although intrigued by the release of the motion picture, I purposely waited to read this novel until after all of the excitement diminished a bit.

And the storyline is both plausible and imaginative, at once.<br /><br />I'm currently digesting \\"Catching Fire\\" at a rapid pace, and hope to offer a review of it shortly.  Bravo, Ms. Collins!

Thanks to this book, I am now looking forward to getting to know the Birkie Trail, and getting heckled by snowmobilers.<br /> This book made me stay up later than I wanted to, and had me laughing out loud. Thanks Walter, for a VERY fun read, and some great inspiration. See you on the trails!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This was one great read! I almost never read any kind of low tech fantasy setting books. This one was recommended to me by a friend that deployed with me to Iraq.

0385536828|5.0|Somewhere in Ian McEwan's brilliant and riveting new novel, Sweet Tooth, readers are treated to a game of mathematical probability. The beautiful and duplicitous Serena Frome - the book's narrator and - walks her lover, a promising writer named Tom Healy, through a complex game of chance.<br /><br />He doesn't truly grasp the context, yet soon after, he pens a story, donating her definition of probability to his key character. \\"At one level, it was obvious enough how these separate parts were tipped in and deployed. The mystery was in how they were blended into something cohesive and plausible, how the ingredients were cooked into something so delicious,\\" Serena reflects.<br /><br />Sweet Tooth is a reader's book and a writer's book. At its heart is invention; the logic that defines the outer world is sublimated into the author's vision of that world. It works beautifully and is, in my opinion, perhaps the most satisfying book that Ian McEwan has ever written. With masterpieces to his credit like Enduring Love, Saturday, Atonement, Amsterdam and others, that says a whole lot.<br /><br />The plot incorporates elements of a classic spy story. Serena Frome is a beautiful and brilliant Cambridge student who is recruited to join the British M15 in the early 1970s during a jittery time in the country's history. Her special mission is to infiltrate the literary circle of an up-and-coming writer and essayist, Tom Healy in a psych-ops mission. To say much more would be to spoil the pleasure of discovery.<br /><br />Suffice to say this: along the way, Mr. McEwan treats us to stories within stories. All of these dazzling stories carry within them the seeds of a future novel. Each is a polished little gem. The craft of the writer is similarly explored; as Serena states, \\"There was, in my view, an unwritten contract with the reader that the writer must honour. No single element of an imagined world or any of its characters should be allowed to dissolve on authorial whim.\\"<br /><br />Lastly, Ian McEwan is at the top of his form in getting into the mind of his female narrator - no easy feat. I completely understood the complex character of Serena and was half in love with Tom Healy myself. Mr. McEwan performs sleights of hand that show an intricate knowledge of the geography of a woman's mind. Whether this book is read as a thriller, a glimpse into the writer's craft, a psychological study, or just a darn good yarn, the themes are universal: love, betrayal, and yes, atonement.br />Lastly, Ian McEwan is at the top of his form in getting into the mind of his female narrator - no easy feat.

B002ZMZBD2|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the second Sherlock Holmes movie, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.  After watching the movie, I wanted to buy the soundtrack.  I listened to it on Spotify, but was a little disappointed.  It wasn't the type of music that I would want to listen to over and over.  Just out of curiosity, I decided to listen to the music from the first movie.  I was blown away at how original, intriguing, and complex it was!  Never even having seen the show, I listen to this soundtrack almost every day.<br /><br />It is one of the few soundtracks that I own where every single track is spectacular and delightfully unique.  \\"Catatonic\\", \\"Ah, Putrefaction\\", and \\"Panic, Shear Bloody Panic\\" are the best of the best.  And in case you were wondering whether it is worth buying the whole album to get \\"Psychological Recovery\\", wonder no more.  It's amazing.  18 minutes of all the themes from the other songs masterfully blended into one track.  (the Sherlock theme played with bag pipes - how more amazing can you get??)<br /><br />I highly recommend this incredible soundtrack. It's as quirky and brilliant as the consulting detective himself.  As a huge fan of the Sherlock books, I'm constantly amazed that Hans Zimmer was able to do one of the greatest characters of all times justice through this music.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Good dystopian science fiction in the tradition of a lot of '50s fiction such as the \\"Demolished Man\\", \\"Level Seven\\", or even \\"On The Beach\\". Well written. I am not quite finished, but I am enjoying it. Nice break from military sci-fi.
031603438X|5.0|A great book. Did not expect it to be as good as it was. Keith describes his life beginning in WWII England, his youth and first interest in music greatly helped by a musician grandfather. Then its on to the blues scene in the early 1960's London, meeting Mick Jagger on a train platform, forming the Stones...<br />Sure there is a lot on the wild lifestyle, the tours, the whole Outlaws on the road stuff which was characteristic of the Stones in the 1970's. But what really comes across in this book is just how much Keith loves music. Some of the discussions get a little technical (open string tuning, getting an acoustic to sound like an electric guitar surprised me - there was no electric on original recording of Jumping Jack Flash and Street Fighting Man, all acoustic). But the one big theme that comes across the whole story of Keith's life is his deep love for music. After reading this I get the sense that Keith really is in the game for the music and has been throughout. I think that Mick also got in the game for the music, but was later sidetracked into what Keith calls LVS (Lead Vocalist Syndrome).<br />We do get to read about the lost decade (1980's) of bad relations between Keith and Mick and how they put it behind them to reunite the band in 1989 and take it forward until their 50th anniversary this year.<br />At the end what I was left with was a story about a terrific musician who led a wild life, created some of the best music for generations and who has been for the past couple of decades a devoted family man.<br />Bottom line - a great book by a great musician, describing one of the most unusual lives...well worth a read!

There is examples, articles inside that boost your thoughts about business and where you could to improve your service and your vision about how do you provides your service.<br /><br />The book itself can make you think about 'how you could to design better services' and it provides tools, thoughts and practice examples that help you collaboratively or alone, to look with empathic eyes for your customer. Highly Recommend.

B000025XE5|5.0|A nice collection of their 1960's radio hits, this disc, in my opinion, serves to showcase one of the world's first \\" garage bands \\". Not great musicians, their music nonetheless, had a rather unique quality.
B008PNBU30|5.0|What can I say about Three Days Grace that has not already been said? These Canadian laddies have grown into strapping, young, maple syrup-chugging men from the mere boys they were when they first exploded on the American music scene in the early 2000s with their Grammy-winning and highly intelligent songs like I Hate Everything About You and Animal I Am Becoming. With Transit of Venus, I think I'm not being too forward or audacious by stating that things have turned full circle for this duo.<br /><br />It is clear that this band is at the top of their personal game in this moment, producing some of the awesomest, sophisticated and grown-up soft rock that any Barry Manilow-lover could possibly want. Again, no one is more surprised than me at the absolute spiritual/personal/emotional growth of these Canadians than I am. It seems like just yesterday that I was popping my Three Days Grace or 1-X CD into my LG 303X radio bookshelf unit and making little devil horns as I put on eyeliner and rawked out to their alt-metal/emo sounds that would help me deal with my many demons! However, Transit of Venus totally represents a turning point of musical creativity for this band, and I hope they just keep going in this intrepid direction.<br /><br />Take the song The High Road, just as one lonely, little example. Don't fri/g/gin tell me that this would not be right at home on Adam Lambert's new CD, okay?! Just don't tell me that, aight! This is a perfect example of their maturity that I'm talking about. Sure, their old hits like I Hate Everything About You boasted of a sophistication and an inner maturity that was light years ahead of all of us and right at home with the Jacka/s/s crew, but the songs on this album are truly for grown-ups.

B008G12ERC|4.0|Boy, oh boy, it is about time that Muse came out with a new CD; I was getting fed up with repeatedly singing the only two songs that this band is ever known for: Uprising and The Resistance. I became a massive Muse fan, I bet I'm the biggest Muse fan in the world right now, ever since I heard Muse's Uprising being played when the genius and very reasonable Glenn Beck was being introduced for his 2010 CPAC speech! I suppose it makes all the sense in the world, too, that all the members of Muse are super Glenn Beck fans who are libertarians at heart (even though they are across the pond and live in Wales).<br /><br />It's safe to say that Muse is the biggest rock band in the world right now, and with very good reason. In fact, just listen to some of their new songs on 2nd Law, and you'll understand why in a jiffy. On songs like Supremacy, they blend the pop-rock sensibilities of Hootie and the Blowfish with the alt-metal leanings of Linkin Park to create something I can only describe as...really, really...special. Other songs such as Big Freeze are apparently the band's love song to their favorite character from Batman (Victor Frees), featuring the hardcore rock elements usually associated with Train and even some serious licks and hooks that you would normally only hear on a Spice Girls album. Surprisingly, to me, anyway, Muse venture into political territory with songs like Madness, where they sing about the madness of the US unemployment rate failing to dip below 8 percent. While they do not mention Barack Obama in this song, they allude to him by singing \\"the Kenyan...the Kenyan...\\" It is clear they mean ole number 44 himself.<br /><br />Okay, okay. I know I said I'm the biggest Muse devotee on the planet right now--courtesy of the fact that I downloaded Uprising and The Resistance from iTunes recently--but I still have to be fair in this review and lightly criticize them. For example, Muse could learn a lot from Justin Bieber. The band members could learn about how to play their instruments a lot tighter, which Justin Bieber (who plays the guitar, the drums, the cello and the bass perfectly) does really well. Second of all, the band members could also learn a lot from Demi Lovato, eating disorder or no eating disorder!! What Demi does really well is write about a lot of serious and deep issues like how to get a boyfriend and staying up late until 11:30 PM on a school night. If Muse would learn what good songwriting topics would be about, then they could elevate their game to even more awesome territory, which I'm all for.<br /><br />Overall, though, buy 2nd Law. You will not regret jamming along to Muse's unique style of Hootie and the Blowfish meets Train for a Welsh audience.ow to play their instruments a lot tighter, which Justin Bieber (who plays the guitar, the drums, the cello and the bass perfectly) does really well.

B008EZVNO0|5.0|This epic record is titled Born To Sing: No Plan B because Van Morrison says that this CD is just not a rehearsal...no sir. Like other records that feel like nothing but rehearsals--CDs by Tony Bennett and Bruce Springsteen come to mind immediately--Van Morrison's latest release feels like he really tried  ultra-hard to make a CD that sounds pretty average, and succeed he did!<br /><br />On this epic record, Van Morrison goes back to his roots, his Beach Boys, pop-infused roots that make this record sound like a Kidz Bop offering, which is a good thing, actually. Just when you think that Van Morrison will finally throw a curveball and pull out a Barry White number, he does something even more amazing: He instead pulls out a Vanilla Ice number by throwing in some raps and some turntable scratch sounds, particularly on tracks 7, 9 and 2. I respect Van Morrison for this, for it seems he is trying to court a much younger and much more gangsta audience, which is a smart move since these demographics control all the money in the CD-buying world anyway. Hey, if Barack Obama can court younger people by hobnobbing with rappers like Jay-Z instead of creating jobs for the American people, then Van Morrison can court younger people, too, right? Right!<br /><br />My only complaint--and it is a very teeny one--is that Van Morrison could still take a lesson or two or three or even four from more established giants than himself in the music industry. I feel that learning from some of his musical superiors would help produce an even better Van Morrison CD in the future. For example, he could learn all about autotune from the likes of that pop-country princess, Taylor Swift, teenybop pop from the likes of that Justin Bieber gal, and jailhouse rap from the likes of Little Wayne.

He enjoys it so much that he says he could play it and watch his favorite program at the same time. He likes the Christmas theme the most. The only thing is that we are in search of the pink angry bird. When the game is loading they show the pink angry bird in those pictures but we don't know which theme/game she is on. All in all game is fun:)
B007TK77QE|1.0|I pre-ordered this book as soon as the possibility came up, and when I received it last week I was thrilled to bits!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was expecting something written by the creator of Hogwarts. What I got was written by JK Rowling (it says so on the book and in all the papers...), BUT I cannot get my mind wrapped around the fact that it is written by the same author as wrote Harry Potter's story.<br /><br />This book is so dark and pessimistic, so full of cruel, stupid and sordid people - I think even Lord Voldemort would have turned his back in disgust - that I frankly had to put the book down. Given my expectations I'm not quite sure I will ever take it up again. Had it been written by someone else, I would have a) read the summary more thoroughly, and b) never have bought it.<br /><br />I am so disappointed, mainly because I've been looking forward to this book for so long, and now it's here it's a stupid grown-up book!!! Says me, 50+, but still a child at heart

0385738765|3.0|The Scorch Trials is the second book in the Maze Runner series by James Dashner.  I always recommend starting at the beginning of a series, and this one is no different, but to be honest, I had a hard time following this one even having read the first.<br /><br />After escaping the maze, Thomas and Co. only think they are somewhere safe when all of a sudden, they find themselves in the middle of another test.  This time they're turned loose in the Scorch, a hot dry area with sickened \\"zombies\\" roaming about.  They all have the sickness too, and are told that in order to get the cure, they must reach a place one hundred miles away in just a few short weeks.  From there it's fighting death and facing betrayal and Thomas has to make several decisions that aren't easy.  But the need to survive is strong in him.<br /><br />Thomas isn't that great of a character.  I don't connect with him at all and it seems like things happen a little too easy and coincidental for him.  With everything being a test it's hard to say that that isn't on purpose, but without revealing enough of those tests, as a reader I simply don't care.  Some of the characters I did really like, like Minho, take a back seat in this book too and it's always about Thomas, which gets a little wearisome since I don't care for him.  Teresa too doesn't improve with this book and in an odd sense, she and Thomas really are perfect for each other, because I rate them at the same level of interesting.  The new girl, Brenda, at least has some fire and real human emotion in her.<br /><br />The plot moves along very quickly but even so it was filled with violence and different descriptions that would make your eyes bug out.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it just seemed like filler to me.  Yes this is a middle book, but it can have a decent plot of its own without merely being words to connect two other books.  I also wonder at how some of the things in this book are written, we have description but it isn't really complete.  I can't picture the places they are talking about very well or even the people.  Thomas himself is supposed to be sixteen, but I always get the impression that he's younger than that based on his description.  It just is hard to form an idea in your head on what the world is like with the little information given.<br /><br />This is just average reading for a dystopian novel.  It has an interesting idea but there's so many loose ends and the fact that this book was filler does it no favors.  I want to know what happens so of course I'll read the last book, but I can only hope it improves on the flaws of the first two.<br /><br />The Scorch Trials<br />Copyright 2010<br />360 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

0451450523|5.0|I grew up with the Last Unicorn movie.  Obsessively watched it in fact and loved every moment of it.  And then just recently I came across the book.  Well of course I had to read it.  And I truly did enjoy it; there were a few things that I would have liked to see done better, but really, this is a great piece of fiction and I can see where the wonderful movie got its inspiration.<br /><br />A unicorn, who's lived in the woods for a very long time, has just gotten word that she's the last.  Which is strange to her, unicorns are solitary creatures and maybe the others are just hiding.  But it's enough to pique her curiosity and get her moving to see what happened to the rest.  But danger follows her on her journey in the form of men, witches, and dark King's.  And even though she gains some helpful companions, she starts to lose herself and forget her journey, even though the future of the Unicorns can only be rescued by her.<br /><br />The unicorn is a very unique character in this book.  Beagle presents her as having different emotions from humans and I think he does it very well.  She's somewhat foreign but still has some base instincts that we can relate to.  Her companions, the Magician and the Molly, are also quite wonderful.  The Magician Schmendrick is a complex character that it's hard to tell sometimes whether he is quite wise or just has dumb luck and even while he can be infuriating at times, you can't help but want him around.  Molly is just solid and steady and comforting, both for the other characters, and the reader.  Even Haggard, the evil King is a great character and while he is somewhat evil, you actually can feel pity for him.  Overall the characters just do a great job of expressing emotion and wisdom and there's a lot of lessons fit into this book.<br /><br />Having seen the movie first I was surprised by all the extra parts of the novel that weren't in the movie.  It doesn't detract from either media, but it made me consider things about the characters that I had never thought before and explained quite a few things about their motivations as well.  I do think the pace was a bit rushed with all that extra added in though.  This book could have easily benefited from an extra hundred pages to keep it flowing smoother.  But it was still magical and one of the better fantasy books that I've come across.  Add in the reminiscence of my childhood and I was hooked.<br /><br />This is definitely going on my \\"keep\\" shelf.  As I've been paring down my books only a special few make it there too, so that just proves how special the book is.  Definitely a fantastic read.<br /><br />The Last Unicorn<br />Copyright 1968<br />248 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B000JIHP88|5.0|I got this based on really good reviews that I saw on this site.  At the time, they were offering it cheaper elsewhere, so I bought it from the local big name mass marketer. I am so without any disappointment whatsoever!! My fiancee was able to put it up with seemingly little to no difficulty.  The batteries seem to be holding out fine so far but we've only had it for a month or so.  My almost 2 month old is in love with the animals and the motion of this mobile. I'm in love with the music.  She's in there as we speaking \\"talking\\" and cooing at the animals and it's just the cutest thing ever.  The music is soothing and the motion is smooth and flawless.  The leaves move counter up and down and around each other.  I'm really hoping this holds out for the long haul.  I really like the fact that the night light can still be used even after baby outgrows the mobile function.  The nightlight is very faint, however and cannot be considered a real night light, but she does seem to stare at it as if transfixed and it's quite cute.<br /><br />**** Update **** Four months later, the mobile is still going strong and she seems to still be enjoying it.  She is hilarious conversating with Mr. Monk, Ms. Ladybird, Mr. Gecko, etc.  We recently had to replace the batteries, but we used the thing quite a bit so 4 months of use seems ok for how much we would let it run.

B00943SQCI|3.0|Tedium is never a good thing in a movie. when you keep checking your watch to see how much is left of this thing, the act of passing time becomes a particularly excruciating exercise. I measured when, for me the thing began to fall apart- 101:13. It was around there when the writer went to a movielover's subtext to maintain the narrative of the film. Movielover's subtext? Vampires represent the oppressive feudal lords of europe, bleeding their peasants dry with oppressive logic which claims their lifelong debt to their feudal lord.  The writer picks up this subtext in earnest around 101:13 and tries to play with it, toggling between camp and brainy fun in the background. You know the script is in trouble when it drags out Alice Cooper to hot things up at 1:26:08. Sure, there are some vague hints toward the philosophical  subtext of the entire vampire genre, but the feints are not clear, instead, shrouded in campy reference which clouds the reason behind the gag. The end, though, returns to victorian camp, with generous footage of slashing, splashing waves and a weepy part which gives heart to the conclusion. So, at the end, from 1972, there is a return to the romantic sentiment of 1876. Debatable as to which is more heartfelt.
B00932A2MC|4.0|Loved it.  Fun ride.  Navy vets are highlighted and honored towards the end.  Pretty cool.  Acting and production quality are very high of course.  Entertaining.
B000J10EQU|1.0|Let this be a lesson to you Bryan Singer, finish what you start and keep the good things coming. I'm not one to tear apart someone's \\"great work\\" but this movie is laughable. Kevin Spacey is given little to work with and comes off as a weak villain. We're not even addressing the infuriating soap opera like feel of the entire story with Superman opting to save a jumbo jet because Lois Lane is on it rather that it being a matter of the right thing to do. I tried to give this movie a chance but about an hour through and I was bored to tears. I felt no passion for Superman or Lex Luthor, they could have been perfect strangers for all intents and purposes who got killed in a driveby that I would have just passed over. Yes old Clark is still bulletproof but the intelligence is in serious doubt as is the chemistry or the the schoolboy charm which is not working for our hero. One has to believe that somewhere at this very moment: Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve and Dean Cain are sharing a collective laugh at this monumental flop. Save your money, rent don't buy.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|Really enjoyed it!  The acting and production levels are quite good.  It's a controversial topic of course, but this seems to take back seat to the unique love story that unfolds.  Very interesting.
B004EPYZU8|1.0|Picture Sin City made much worse and do I really need to say any more about Sucker Punch? Oh the story doesn't follow any linear lines, somewhow we get from mental institution to brothel over night. I didn't make it past that part. My eyes started bleeding profusely as my soul offered itself to a higher power for soiling my DVD player with this crap. Abysmal doesn't cover this movie, it's the kind of trash you should to death row inmates 24 hours before execution just to violate the sanctity of their hearts and minds. This kind of films makes you wonder if storytelling shouldn't be a licensed job where you actually have to show serious competence before ever entering a studio.
B005LAII80|5.0|Just got a chance to see this movie, yesterday. It was great. Karl Urban brought a faithful rendition to our favorite judge, Judge Dredd. Great visuals and music. I hope that a sequel will be done, despite the low number at the box office. For the cost of making this movie, the cast and film crew have created a cult favorite, that should be commended for. This is no \\"Battleship\\" nor a 2012, \\"Total Recall.\\" Outstanding movie.
0345803493|4.0|For some reason, I find myself expecting to disklike the books in this series.  And not wanting to like them so much.  But at the same time, I couldn't wait to get a break from tour books just so I could indulge in this guilty pleasure.  And once again, I found myself surprised by how much I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />I really liked Ana once again.  Strong yet vulnerable and gives Christian a hard time when he's being unreasonable.  I found that her inner goddess and subconsious didn't make as much of an appearance in this book and I missed that (although I definitely enjoyed the times they did appear).  I was glad to see that Ana stuck to her beliefs about the whole Dom thing.<br /><br />And I think Christian might starting to be growing on me.  I know, I know.  He's still fifty shades of messed up but I like how he changed his ways for the woman he loved.  And I like how we're shown that he does have a heart.<br /><br />I was once again sucked into the book and can't wait to get my  next break from tour books so I can dive into the third book of the trilogy!

B008NR90HQ|5.0|This recording was made in what seem to be almost informal conditions at the London Hippodrome in 2007. The informality is underlined, not only by Gary's pleasantly laid-back approach to the audience and to his own performance, but also because of the frequent sights of the recording technicians behind the players but still 'in shot'. Rumour has it that this recording was made more as a private recording for Gary rather than as a full-blown commercial venture. If this really was a non-commercial venture initially then we can count ourselves very lucky indeed that it was made, that it is as good as it is technically and that it has been released for general consumption.<br /><br />Gary was one of the finest guitarists of his generation and had a particularly high regard for the work of Jimi Hendrix. It is arguable that he was probably the only guitarist capable of such a tribute at the time and what we are able to share here is an absolutely authentic Hendrix sound but with the added advantage of a far superior recording quality than was possible in Jimi's own lifetime.<br /><br />The concert starts with the iconic Purple Haze then works its way through a further 12 numbers before Gary concludes with the comment that he doesn't know any more to perform! We should not complain as this is a generous selection running for some 74 minutes and delivers high musical quality throughout. The style of performance is that of modest concentration demonstrating Gary Moore's obvious personal respect for the music of Hendrix. Two members of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Mitch Mitchell on drums and Billy Cox on guitar, join Gary for a couple of numbers towards the end. No-one would guess that this was achieved with the minimum of rehearsal time.<br /><br />In conclusion therefore, this is a fine tribute to one ground-breaking guitarist by another fine guitarist and which is presented simply and modestly and with obvious respect and enjoyment. The recording is visually fine enough to convey the atmosphere of the occasion and is presented in enjoyable quality of both DTS surround and stereo sound. It should give followers of both Jimi Hendrix and Gary Moore great satisfaction and on that basis, this unique concert can safely be rated as a 5 star release.convey the atmosphere of the occasion and is presented in enjoyable quality of both DTS surround and stereo sound.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|SPOILER<br /><br />I enjoyed both first and second seasons of The Walking Dead. I'll say that I've never read the comics, so I have no basis for comparison between both.<br /><br />Anyway, from what I understand, this is a show that should take four or five seasons most before ending. No matter how complicated and hard are the situation of the characters and their relationship, I think there is not enough plot and premise to extend the show for six, seven, eight seasons.<br /><br />I thought Season 2 is as good as Season 1 (and longer, of course, with 13 episodes). The fact that whole lot of episodes occur in a time frame of two, three days was very unusual. But the scary moments were enough to excite me, a good balance between the drama that evolve in the farm (however, I did not expect the \\"Pregnancy Card\\" to come so soon into play...)and the damned zombies.<br /><br />The extras in this package are also excellent, with figurine details, the death of Shane, some interviews with cast.<br /><br />Acting is top notching. Heck, I watched the whole thing in two days!<br /><br />Can't hardly wait for Season Three.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is just fun to read especialy if you are old enough to remember the movies and games from the '80's that decorate this book from start to finish.  Good plot, well written and moves fairly quickly; what more can you ask for!
B008RV5K4U|4.0|Part One of this adaptation is spot-on. Because the illustration is so crucial to this story, it could only be animated, not live action. The voices are great, as well. Unfortunately for part two, the voice of the Joker was chosen very, very poorly, all but destroying the character from the book (TDKR's Joker should be voiced by Tim Curry, not Beavis). I intend to skip all the Joker parts of part two (they REALLY screwed this up!), but Part One is terrific. My only criticism of part one is that much of the terrific narration from Batman/Bruce Wayne was omitted, lines that helped create the tone of the book. However, the Mutants seem to have retained the cool language of the graphic novel, and for that I am grateful. Oh, and you hear the Joker at the end, which left me eager to skip part two.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you have read the two first books, this is also a great book that continues the story. The more you get into the story the better you know the different characters and the more you will enjoy. You have to like long books and long stories.
0123694965|5.0|Frankly, it is a thick book, and I haven't finished reading it. But frankly once more, making a good game is beyond one thick book.<br />This book is a great starting point.<br />There is no guarantee that one can make a great game after reading this book, but it is almost a certainty one would make avoidable mistakes without reading this book.<br />It starts with the whole picture as briefing what makes a person a game designer and a game, well, a game. Then it breaks elements down into categories, such as the process of brainstorming and structure of an effective production cycle. Then, for most of the book, it is about how to design elements of game correctly, with players in mind.<br />The only downside of the book is Schell sometimes describes excessively, which is probably one of the reasons this book is this thick. On the other hand, he writes \\"summaries\\" after each important point by giving out lenses of essential questions so that readers can quickly recall memory and be on track.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|great film got it for my wife who had read the book.. though it was used the dvd played perfectly. thanks again for great service
076790592X|1.0|I picked this for a book club based on the many great reviews and fertile topics of discussion the book seemed to bring.  Unfortunately, I found the afforisms in the book to be light weight and the sort of thing  one might read in a fortune cookie.  \\"Love each other or perish\\";\\"Forgive yourself before you die. Then forgive others\\"; \\"Dying is only one thing to be sad over. Living unhappily is something else.\\" I also found the author coming across as opportunistic.  He sought out his college professor only after finding out from the Ted Kopple Show that the professor was dying of a disease process in his 80's.  The author loses his job AFTER finding the professor and then begins his book writing effort supposedly at the encouragement of the professor.  The author emphasizes that the book was the professor's idea several times. Not life changing; not entertaining; but short at least. I found The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch to be a thousand times more inspirational.
0316228532|4.0|So I just finished The Casual Vacancy by JK Rowling.<br />I loved it personally but it's very much my taste, I could see a lot of people strongly disliking it.<br />It's very character driven, Rowling uses multiple points of view and sometimes you wonder where exactly she's going with it, but there is a climax and resolution, it's just farther down the road than you would expect.<br />Not only is it character driven but it's also introspective, most the book takes place inside the heads of the characters. I personally love it when books do that, but again, many people do not.<br />It's very different than Harry Potter, however, sometimes the writing does remind me a bit of her writing in Harry Potter. I would not recommend this book to a lot of people, since they may think it'll be JUST LIKE HARRY POTTER (trust me it's not), but I also think certain groups of people would extremely enjoy it, especially people who enjoy literary fiction.<br />I honestly didn't expect anything that happened in the book, which is refreshing for me because I'm used to theorizing and predicting what is going to happen next. I only made one silent prediction and I was wrong.<br />It's very... sexual and drugs and (obviously) politics are a big part of it. But I enjoyed it all, even the character's perspectives who I either didn't like much or disagreed with, because you could feel the empathy that Rowling had for all of them. Even the swots. Therefore,  the reader could feel bad for/sympathetic the even the most obnoxious characters, which I always feel is a good thing. The more empathy you have for fictional characters the more likely you are to feel empathy for a living human being (in my opinion).<br />Parts of it really, really touched me, but I have to say this book will probably not be one of my favorite books. I did really enjoy it but I don't know. It's not going to be a favorite of mine although I'm glad I bought it and I'm proud to have it on my bookshelf.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Omg Gideon Cross. I am well aware of the fact that he is a character in a book, but God I love that man. I have a love for the Crossfire Series. I laughed and cried while reaing this book. I really wanted to knock some sense into Gideon for the way that he was hurting Eva. I love to read a good book that make you feel as if you personally know the characters, and that is what I got when I read Bared to You and Reflected in You. I have no idea that the story would play out the way that it did. I figured that if Nathan ever did come back into the picture to hurt Eva that overload of OMG sexy Cross would kill him before he even had the chance. They just need thier complete happy ending now. I cannot wait for book 3,and please Ms.Day please, please dont stop at 3. The life and Eva and Gideon should seriously be turned into a TV series for all of the Eva & Gideon junkies.

B009AMAKJU|5.0|I just got out of the theater and watched Perks of Being a Wallflower.  While I was not expecting anything more than your average typical teen film, I was pleasantly surprised.  I have to admit I never read the book and have no intention of doing so.  In fact the only reason I went to see the movie because I absolutely adore Emma Watson.  This was apparently her first post potter film<br /><br />The movie takes place in Pittsburgh.  While I loved the tunnel scenes while they were driving in the truck and Sam(Emma Watson) was standing in the bed of the truck with the with blowing in her face and the bridge shots of the city.  Overall I was a bit disappointed that other than that there were really no scenes whatsoever in downtown Pittsburgh or interesting landscapes whatsoever, but apparently that is irrelevant to the movie's plot.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Logan Lerman(Charlie) who is the main character starts his freshman year knowing no one and is a loner.  He meets the tall gay gay with the long her who introduces him to his bevy of friends and makes him feel welcome by making a toast to him at a party making Logan feel welcome.  One of those friends is the adorable Emma Watson(sam) who Logan is enamored with, but it starts with innocent friendship and common trust and similar abusive backgrounds which they can relate to.  Sam is dating an older college guy who is not really interested in Sam but just using her and Sam has had an abusive childhood of her own fraught with pain. Just like Charlie(Logan) who was also sexually assaulted and abused as a child and has left scars.  This makes their connection stronger.<br /><br />In other words these groups of friends become  Charlie's family and make him feel welcome, however they are all upperclassman and are ready to graduate while he is still a freshman and he will likely be a loner again. Charlie is into writing and wants to become a writer. Charlie briefly dates some annoying girl in the group of friends briefly butat a party decides on a dare to kiss the prettiest girl at the party and he of course kisses Emma Watson even though he is still sort of dating the annoying girl who is sitting right next to Logan as he sucks face with Emma.  Both girls are flabbergasted and confused and makes for another awkward evening with Charlie leaving.<br /><br />Later after Charlie breaks up with annoying girl and Sam invites him to her bedroom they have a real heart to heart about their past, exchanging of sentimental gifts(a typewriter she buys for Charlie's writing), and she tells him he is the only guy to has ever cared about her- helps her  by helping her improve her SATS to get into Penn State and  he seems to be in love with Sam and vice -versa.  Charlie soon tells her how he feels about her on her bed and kisses her and it kind of implies they have sexual intercourse but it is not really clear as the scene changes to the morning after to another scene.  Later during the film as Sam drives off before she gets into the truck apparently heading off for college her and Charlie kiss but it is not clear whether they are a couple or not which should have been made more apparent.<br /><br />Anyway fast forward the end of the school year , they part ways and Charlie begins to write about them who is a literature buff and sees his old upper hs friends when they come home from college. And things seem to be \\"normal\\" again.<br /><br />The reason this movie is interesting is because it deals with real issues such as friends who can fall in love, , dumping annoying girls, falling in love with an adolescent who you can relate to and the wrong people, jealousy, homosexuality, parties, drugs, cafeteria fights(which in this movie was ridiculous and unbelievable to say the least) and just about any other thing that one has encountered in high school at some juncture.<br /><br />Logan Lerman gives a great performance and the gay dude, but I particular applaud Emma Watson's performance because she playsthe part of Sam so well with incredible motion range who is very sentimental and cries at the right moments and truly seems to care about the characters and hardships in the movie, particular Charlie. She has a good American accent too! She is no longer Hermione Granger at all. A bit of a tear jerker towards the 2nd half of the movie and the movie especially hits hard home for any hs student who has any been a loner or a wallflower in love with the cute girl in school or anyone who has never really felt they belong in those awkward adolescent teen years which is practically everyone.<br /><br />My only slight complaint was the ending. It seemed sort of rushed, incomplete, with all sorts of loose ends untied lacking deep emotion - mainly between Logan and Sam.  We never really get a sense if anything will ever happen in the long run with Sam and Charlie or how deeply they feel for one another(except the bedroom scene where they kiss) upon seeing each other in a diner when Sam is home on college break where the empathetic connection seems to be lacking between the two and one is left dumbfounded as to how they feel for one another.  I was definitely hoping for a more profound touching ending that made one think long and hard after the movie when the credits rolled and that was not the case for me anyway.  And Paul Rudd gives a perfunctory bland performance as he does in all his roles.<br /><br />Otherwise pretty pleased with the movie. A-/B+
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Though a grouchy, grumpy, or sleepy dwarf might give this film a mere average rating, this film deserves more than that.  The two swords of darkness and hope intersect for this fairy tale to feel real...and yet surreal.  All the magic is fantastical, but at times they go out of their way to explain how normal things can seem magical.  In many ways they wrap messages that help cut to the core of their reality.  Most interestingly, they come through with strong undertones that show the absurdity of the extreme feminist polarity by means of a female redeemer.  Overall, very well thought out and intriguing for entertainment and analysis.  However, the story did seemed a bit rushed at the end (thus 4 star).

0140120416|5.0|The New Penguin Russian Course has earned my most enthusiastic and unreserved praise! I must begin by saying I'm quite familiar with English grammar, and have learned four other languages. I subsequently employed two of the most well-known aural programs and several of the popularly billed instructional books in my attempt to learn Russian. All the other programs have left me doubtful/uneasy, and at worst, totally confused. Not so the New Penguin Russian Course.<br />In my judgement, the New Penguin Course is unequaled for its detailed clarity, usability, and simple excellence of instruction.  At every level from elementary to advanced, it explains what I need to know, starting with pronunciation, the alphabet, and working on through recognition of gender, cases, verb forms, special usages, and so on.  And it teaches these things thoroughly and in a way that makes them easy to remember.  An A+ for Penguin.

B001C4CI8U|4.0|It's interesting that rewatching the first season of Fringe, while we're currently in the fifth season, you can see the seeds of the future plots being planted.  The Observers, so central to the future episodes, can be seen in crowd shots early in the first season.  The production of the DVDs is first-rate, with interviews, explanations, and a gag reel, just like in a first-run movie.  I highly recommend this collection to fans and newbies alike.

B008QE9VJI|3.0|My review here is inspired by the myriad opinions being voiced about this movie, opinions which are highly bifurcated. Many people want to defend the movie entirely or lambast it in full with little room in between. I would like to join the vocal minority who believe this movie is neither dark nor light, but a shade of grey.<br /><br />This film does something that few filmmakers in Hollywood would ever dare to do: it attempts to capture the magic of a soap opera, and one that lasted the better part of a decade, in a 2-hour film. This has been attempted before, specifically with Dark Shadows. \\"House of Dark Shadows\\" worked at the time, and still feels good for long-time fans of the series, but newcomers are often left feeling that they missed something. They did - the entire rest of the series. A good soap opera never has just one plot - it has many which arch over multiple episodes/seasons, or wrap around each other, or come and go...it is maddening to try and follow. To boil down the essence of a series like that into a single film is a ludicrous task. But they did it, and good for them for trying. It is ambitious, and I respect that.<br /><br />Going into \\"Dark Shadows,\\" one needs to keep this in mind: Burton and crew attempted to take the most popular story arc from the series, Barnabas's curse and his feud with Angelique, and distill it into a stand-alone plot. But, being who they are, the filmmakers could not ignore the source material entirely. What we end up with is a solid plot which is constantly interrupted by smaller, less poignant plots which are related to the main plot (though some are more related than others). That is exactly what the series did, only it did it over the course of years, not a couple hours. Having watched the series, I know that there are some subplots worth skipping. This movie felt the same way - I really liked the main plot but I could have done without some of the sidebars.<br /><br />All this makes the film hard to swallow for viewers. Some viewers wanted a film slavishly devoted to the source material and others wanted a pure-bred Burton horror/comedy. What we all got was something in between. When this movie gets dark, it gets dark. When it gets goofy, it gets goofy. These two halves don't exactly blend together, and instead we get an oil/water effect - they never blend into the perfect mixture but neither does one detract from the other. They just sort of coexist together. Some people want the movie to pick a side: either be a pure comedy (which would have felt insulting to the source material and its fans) or a pure horror (which runs the risk of taking its dark side too seriously the way \\"Dark Shadows: The Revival\\" did). What we should do is take it for what it is. You may not like everything about it, but maybe you'll like more than you expected.<br /><br />Confused yet? Yeah, sorry, but this is a weird movie to describe while remaining neutral. And be sure, I am neutral. I didn't hate this movie like I thought I would, but neither am I willing to run out and pay $20 for a new copy. I'm going to wait for the price to drop, then I'll consider it.<br /><br />Would I recommend this movie? Yes, but only to open-minded DS fans, Burton fans, and the occasional horror/comedy fan. I don't think most people will feel connected to this story, but maybe they will connect with just enough of it to see it as an acceptable popcorn flick. If you feel like you want to give it a chance, do so. Otherwise, leave it alone and find something else. It isn't a movie to watch unless you really feel like you should.<br /><br />On a side note, my mother was a die-hard fan of the show back in the 60s. I took her to see this movie opening weekend and she really liked it, more so than I did. She took it for what it was and said to me afterwards, \\"It was like watching a miniature series, like I just watched an entire season in one sitting. I hope they make a sequel.\\" And she dislikes everything Burton or Depp does. Take that evidence for what you will. I know other die-hard fans who despised it. You never know...
B006LSZECO|5.0|I guarantee you that you are not emotionally prepared for the ride Gillian Flynn is going to take you on in her new novel. The story starts off a little slow and seems like a story you may have read somewhere before but as more facts are uncovered a series of WTF and OMG moments results and you suddenly can't put it down. In the end, whether the good guy wins or loses is wholly dependent on your perspective.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|My wife and I both played this and couldn't stop once we started. The puzzles can be challenging and the object searches are always entertaining. We are anxiously awaiting the sequel so we can continue the plot, which was suspenseful and entertaining. It reminded me of games I've played on Xbox like \\"Alan Wake\\" or \\"Deadly Premonition\\" with that Twin-Peaks-style murder mystery approach. I will also be looking into other games by Big Fish. I hope they are as much fun as this was.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was looking for a reason to escape from work and this was a fast paced read that kept me engaged and intrigued.  The characters were interesting and the plot unique ( at least to me as I rarely read sci-fi type literature).  I read all 3 and wished there were more.  I realize it is a youth read but as an adult I found it refreshing and enjoyable.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I enjoyed it. I would watch it again. It is more than a 3 star movie, but it has to be really good for me to rate a movie 4 stars.<br /><br />Well done. Pleasantly surprised.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It's fabulous. Amazing. I don't even know what else to say except that I absolutely loved it. Bared to You had become one of my all-time favorites. My expectations for Reflected in You were incredibly high and Sylvia Day definitely did not disappoint! Reflected began right where Bared stopped and just gave MORE. Of everyone - Eva, Gideon, and Cary. I read it straight thru without stopping and cannot wait for Entwined with You!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|20ish years ago, i worked at a major Electronics chain that sold the consumer version of these headphones (MDRV6). Those headphones were revered by many musicians and DJ's for their sound quality. When it came time for me to upgrade from my older MDRV6's, i decided to see what has changed . I found that there has been a new revival for higher quality headphones and there are old and new names making them. I discovered during my research these which were the professional models of the MDRV6. I tested a few others but liked the neutral sound the Sony's produced. After a few weeks, these I am still enjoying them and these are my observations...<br /><br /> Sound Quality: As mentioned in other reviews, these headphones are very accurate, meaning you hear what the engineer heard when either recording the music or producing the finished product. I have listened to other brands and the difference is these have crisp highs without artificial sizzle and deep punchy bass without the sloppy boom.<br /><br />Build quality: overall these have a nice feel, not too heavy yet solid. Like most items I expect them to wear over time, but so far they are solid.<br /><br />Overall,  if your listening preference is for overstated bass, these are not for you. These headphones are for the listener who wants to distinguish a Gibson from a Fender or hear the breath of the singer on a good recording. I highly recommend these headphones.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|If you love vampires (or witches, werewolves, hybrids, and ghosts) and YA-type romances, you will love Vampire Diaries! Season 3 had me gasping and cringing and ooing and awwing at every single turn. The love triangle in this show is epic, and so much more realistic than in other shows and books.<br /><br />Elena clearly has feelings for both the Salvatore brothers and is constantly torn between the love she has for Stefan, and the feelings that she has for his bad boy, older brother, Damon. I love that this is a REAL love triangle, unlike the triangle in Twilight which I thought was strange because clearly Bella never wavered from Edward and so it was more like Bella and Edward, with Jacob hanging around on the outside. This is not like that. This is a real triangle with real tangles and implications because she has real feelings for both of them.<br /><br />My only complaint was probably how the season ended. My jaw hit the ground (so kudos for that) but I couldn't help but feel worried about what's next, especially since...***SPOILER ALERT***...Elena is now a vampire!! Frankly, I was shocked, and concerned about what direction the show is going in because 90% of the previous plots had to do with keeping fragile, human Elena out of harms way, or keeping the original, Klaus, away from her human doppelganger blood. Obviously, all of those plots are going to get flushed down the toilet now so where will that leave us? Also, we already saw the 3-vampire triangle with Damon, Stefan and Catharine, and personally, it didn't do anything for me. I just hope it's not going to be like that or we might be in trouble.<br /><br />Either way, I loved this season and am waiting on pins for the season 4 premiere!
1423140605|5.0|I think I could kill Rick Riordan-but then I wouldn't get to read THE HOUSE OF HADES. That's the next book in this series, BTW.<br />Awesome book. Woke up at 5:00 in the morning just to get a head start on reading it. LOVED IT. It was everything I was expecting-and a few things I wasn't. Had me on the edge of my seat trying to finish it faster, and at the same time trying to slow down to savor the words more and take them all in. To all the people who haven't read this book-it does not disappoint. All of the Seven gather on the Argo II, and we get a great Percabeth reunion. I did not know Annabeth knew judo.<br />Lots of new monsters make an appearence-especially one who is, in my opinion, the most awesome villain so far. Some good jokes, too.<br />LOVED THIS BOOK. Everyone-hurry and buy a copy. I swear on the Styx, you will not be disappointed! Although if you also feel the same about killing Rick Riordan at the end, I totally understand.

1572816112|5.0|I received this deck today. The cards are well done. The finish is a matte finish. The dimensions of the cards are 5 1/8 by 2 6/8.  You will receive a title card and a card that gives a short biography about the author. You'll also receive a Little White Book (LWB) with all of the meanings...upright and reversed.  You'll also receive a large poster with the Lunatic Spread.  It gives you a ten card spread. It's really nice to look at. It's large enough to spread on a reading table. You'll like it. It's quite artistic. It has a large moon with a face in the middle. The ten spaces for the cards surround the large moon. The spaces for the cards tell you how to interpret each card.  For example, space number 4 says that you should deal with secret desires and wishes.  There are stars, buildings and trees.  It's a really nice poster. I intend to use it.<br /><br />You will really like this deck. I think that it's a great deck for Halloween which is coming up soon.  It's a good deck to read with every day. I really like it.<br /><br />Have fun with this deck!
0439023513|5.0|Let me preface this review by disclosing that I was recently 'awakened' over a year ago and have been spending a great deal of my time truth seeking ever since. When I saw the Hunger Games movie being heavily promoted for the summer movie of 2011, I was disturbed by the concept of fighting children to the death for the entertainment of the elite. I have a teenage son, and felt compelled to read the book to find out what kind of concepts were being pushed on the youth culture.<br /><br />Mockingjay is not a fairytale. For those that are not ready to deal with the truth and require a fairytale ending, this book won't be for you. Mockingjay is extremely realistic and deals with so many of the concepts that have existed in our world for thousands of years. It is a cautionary tale and perfectly portrays real concepts like propoganda, controlled opposition, cointelpro, mass mind control, psychological warfare, illusions and idol worship. How often do we fall in love with a person or guru on television, such as the Oprah's and Joel Olsteen's of today, and look to them for our inspiration without the use of discernment?  Their infectious personalities are what attracts people to them and we dont even consider that they could be used to distract the masses from paying attention to the real chess masters and even worse, these gurus probably don't know they are being used. Much like Katniss, who became the face of the rebellion, her intentions were good,however; the powers that be co-opted the organic movement of the girl on fire and Katniss was used and being manipulated for no more than a pawn in the play for power.<br /><br />We must stop looking to others to lead us. You may be lead down a dark road no matter how good your intentions are. As the old saying goes, the road to hell was paved with good intentions. We must get back to using discernment. We cannot believe everything we see on television, including and ECSPECIALLY the controlled news media outlets. We must stop the worship of characters that inspire us on television, they are most likely owned and controlled by the powers that be to push an agenda that does not serve humanity. Question everything! We must relearn critical thinking skills and teach our children how to think so we can stop this viscious cycle of a very small few controlling the many. We must stop feeding our children fairytales and start dealing with the truth.<br /><br />No fairy tale endings here. An excellent book and highly recommended.
1250000971|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book until the cliff hangar ending. I know there's another book yet to come but it would be nice to know the results before the long wait for the next book in the series. I also had a hard time believing the blood sample was still in a street persons coat after time had gone by and it was probably worn many times since. Even the thought that a street person had the coat was a bit unreal to me. In general, I loved the rest of the story.

B007THA4FI|1.0|After reading the Harry Potter series, I was so happy to see another creation by Rowling.  This book is the biggest bunch of drivel I've ever tried to read.  Her use of so much shocking language and subject matter is really irritating.  She had no purpose in using this type of material other than to make it an Adult book.  The language is unneeded for the story and the story seems to have no real plot.  It is total garbage as far as I am concerned.  I do believe that teens might like it just for the tittillating passages, but adults should be offended by the way the material is presented.  When necessary to make a point, then I don't mind graphic language, but her usage is only for shock value, I believe.  It seems she believes that it is needed to make it an Adult book.  I am sorry I wasted my money on this garbage.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is hard to put it down. I have enjoyed this book very much. Recommend if you like a good drama/thriller.
0345803493|2.0|I won´t complain about the bad writing, the constant repetitions (seriously, how often can a person blush?) or the missing plot. Other people already did it, and I agree with them. However, here´s what, for me, made the difference between a badly written, although sometimes quite entertaining love story, and this book:<br /><br />Most of the women I know are not (yet) able to get an orgasm from intercourse only. They need to be stimulated otherwise in order to find their release\\" (There, I said it. It´s rubbing off...) Some of them however managed to find their favorite position and, after a lot of - for lack of a better word, practice - they finally could come. There is this one really lucky girl I know who can do it every time and pretty fast. But none of them, not even her, is able to come in every possible situation and position! Seriously, with him on top, with her on top, lying down, standing up, after a fight, during a fight, at 3 am after waking up from a nightmare, at 6.30 in the morning before work (btw: morning breath or the typical need to pee after waking up? Non existent!), after being threatened with a gun or, and that´s my favourite scene in book one, by being pinched in the nipples. I mean, seriously? That´s not even sexy anymore, because all you can think while reading those scenes is Yeah, right, THAT´S how it works\\"... Frankly, I think it´s pretty mean to let people believe that all it takes for a woman to come is frowning and whispering (There, again!) let go for me\\". I know that it´s fiction, but inexperienced people might actually believe it and be really disappointed when they find out the truth. Oh, and re-reading the same old sex-scene over and over again does not make it any hotter, handcuffs or not.<br /><br />To  summarize: It´s a story about an inexperienced yet beautiful young woman, discovering her sexuality with a drop dead gorgeous, mysterious man who, by the way, is equipped to refuel a Boeing 747 in flight, and still it bores the crap out of the reader. Congratulations, Mrs. Jones, that´s quite an achievement!
0143116738|4.0|This is one of the most interesting books about education anyone can read, addressed to 21st century society. Robinson and Aronica illustrated their thesis with many real cases of espectacular moves from routine and boredom to happy creativity. Then come his last chapter \\"Afterword\\" and, to me, a wonderful book is tarnished. The chapter might have been written by someone else. In it the authors join the enormous bandwagon of \\"climate crisis\\" a clever invention serving special interests as the climate in the last 2,000 years cycled many times from cold to warm in a modest variation. Rachel Carson is recalled, no doubt of great importance to our concerns towards the environment, but we know how much she exaggerated and was wrong about issues. Then comes the \\"other climate crisis\\" where some of our serious societal problems are touched like the abuse on drugs to fight depression, alcohol, suicide statistics, expendidures on higher education vis &agrave; vis on prisons. Next they focus on population growth and the move of people to cities. The whole seems a shalow treatment of those issues and datached from the main thesis on education and creativity. Then come \\"aiming high\\" when, after describing the living potential of Death Valey revealed by a very rare seven inches of rain, the authors decide to connect the problems (now dubbed \\"crisis\\") in human resources management with \\"nature\\". I missed the connection by the way. They quote from Jonas Salk that the environmental consequences of the demise of all insects would be enormous but none if humanity disappears. This amazing quote is followed by the remark: \\"What he meant is that we have now become the problem.\\" While throughout his book he always points the solution this is just a scare and an invitation for guilt.<br />First, insects are that important for the \\"environment\\" because they are midway in the food chain besides acting as scavengers and pollinators. If all marine mammals disappear I would say that the result would be a lot more discreet than the demise of humans. Other groups of fish would rapidly ocuppy the vacant niche, with minimum effects because, like men, they also are at the top of a food chain. I am appaled that these days, members of my species became vocal in removing us from nature together with the impressive \\"works of men\\" (Shakespeare knew better...). The earth would, to me, look alien and, although beautiful as it is now (about 46% of the planet is untouched as environmentalist and photographer Sebastião Salgado found out) the lack of our species would degrade it and I would dearly miss cities, villages, plantations, bridges, the sound of music and work, the sight of humans everywhere people lived. I recalled being swept away by the words of Antoine de Saint-Exup&eacute;ry in his book \\"Terre des hommes\\" when flying over villages and thinking about the people below, their lights flickering in the night. How sad the world would be! I found remarkable that after explaining the wonders of human creativity the authors consider men \\"the problem\\". What a final message! No wonder suicide is on the rise. About cities please check Stewart Brand on TED (Stewart Brand proclaims 4 environmental 'heresies')<br />About the theories that men will deplete \\"natural resources\\" please listen to Julian L. Simon (The ultimate resource 2) and learn that, on a par with Robinson (!) he explains why the \\"only natural resource that matters is educated people in free societies\\". They will carry on and solve the environmental and social problems of the future better if we just stop preaching them catastrophe and guilt.be a lot more discreet than the demise of humans.

B007PZADLO|5.0|Train continues to amaze me.  The music they are making today, is music I love as much as their stuff from 15 years ago.  That's rare.  The vinyl pressing is good, and as usual, lends depth to the listening experience not found in other media.
1451662432|5.0|Since Amazon apparently sees fit to neglect any control over ratings of products, I will \\"join the fray\\" and rate the book despite the fact that I have not yet read it! It appears to be a greatly interesting book that I plan to read. I, unlike many of the other \\"non-reading raters\\" possess an open mind and am willing to read a person's autobiography even if the subject did cheat on his wife!
B008V4H6N6|4.0|FlyLo ambitiously stitches together a diverse array of musical styles on Until The Quiet Comes to produce a mesmeric lattice-work of psychedelic wonderment; with winding basslines, stuttering drum beats, bright keyboards and pitch shifted vocals featuring heavily throughout this albums duration. Although that might sound like an unpenetrable and potentially alienating concoction on paper, Mr Ellison's consumate compositional skills bring all these disparate elements together, by filtering them through his unique lens of jazzy electronica much like he did on his previous opus \\"Cosmogramma\\". \\"UTQC\\" is an all together more apporachable work than it's predecessor though, with FlyLo choosing to create a lush soundscape of mind altering mood pieces with the aforementioned elements, rather than densely packing everything together to produce something as abstract and otherwordly as \\"Cosmogramma\\". Fans of electronic music in general should find plenty on \\"UTQC\\" to drool over, but those of you who have a penchant particularly for Amon Tobin's brand of Jazz infused breakbeat and/or Matthew Herbert's soulful microhouse will be especially taken by this albums three dimensional fusion of experimental jazz and multifarious electronica.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Kids' movie? Hardly. Rango is a violent, crude, and worst of all, boring movie. Can't recommend this one for anyone under 16-years-old, and can't understand how anyone over 16 would like it.
B005LAII9Y|4.0|\\"Frankenweenie\\" is Tim Burton's first stop-motion animated film in seven years, his first film not to feature Johnny Depp in nearly a decade, and his first film not to feature his wife Helena Bonham Carter since \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" back in 1999. There also aren't any big musical numbers or songs in \\"Frankenweenie,\\" which seems a bit odd after watching the Tim Burton produced \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"Corpse Bride.\\" It's also a massive improvement over Burton's other film released earlier this year; the remake of the TV series from 1966 \\"Dark Shadows.\\"<br /><br />\\"ParaNorman\\" seemed to beat \\"Frankenweenie\\" to the punch by nearly two months, but the main difference is that \\"ParaNorman\\" is centered around zombies where \\"Frankenweenie\\" is more \\"Frankenstein\\" influenced. There are countless horror influences in both films, but \\"ParaNorman\\" is a bit more adult in comparison and makes you laugh out loud more often whereas \\"Frankenweenie\\" mostly just makes you snicker but certainly has a lot more heart.<br /><br />This is the first time in a long time that Danny Elfman's score for a Tim Burton film doesn't feel overly clich&eacute; or obnoxious. Maybe it's because this is coming from a dog owner and from someone who loves dogs, but it was really easy to relate to Victor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) and his relationship to his dog Sparky. Tearing up is also something that doesn't happen very often, but it occurred every time Sparky was brought back to life while that somber piece of Elfman orchestration tenderly picks its moment to sucker punch you in the chest. Boys that age often look to their dogs as their best friend, but in this case Sparky is Victor's only friend and they're inseparable. Sparky's never ending energy, his ability to amuse himself, and the way he dances whenever he's happy only makes you feel for the character even more.<br /><br />Most of the characters in \\"Frankenweenie\\" have these really tiny mouths and it's kind of boring to watch them talk. Victor's next door neighbor and mayor of New Holland Mr. Burgemeister (voiced by Martin Short) has this incredibly animated mouth though. His round shape helps, but his mouth movements are so extreme and fluid. The same can be said for Victor's new science-obsessed teacher Mr. Rzykruski (voiced by Martin Landau). Similar in appearance to Vincent Price, the outstretched shape of his head along with his long and awkwardly shaped teeth have you fixated on him the entire time. His eccentric speeches about lightning and the townsfolk being too stupid to comprehend science cements the fantastic nature of Mr. Rzykruski.<br /><br />The classic horror movie references are all over the place; \\"Pet Sematary,\\" \\"An American Werewolf in London,\\" \\"Dracula,\\" and countless references to the original \\"Frankenstein\\" including author Mary Shelley. You also can't go wrong with a \\"Gamera\\" or \\"Godzilla\\" reference.<br /><br />The frustrating part of \\"Frankenweenie\\" is that there are many factors that feel like a safe zone for Tim Burton since he's done them so many times in the past. While the Danny Elfman score only enhances the experience, many may think otherwise since Elfman has been Burton's go to musical director for his entire career. Many of the secondary characters in the film are really familiar, as well. When you first see Mr. Burgemeister's niece Elsa Van Helsing, she looks exactly like Lydia from \\"Beetlejuice\\" so you automatically know it's Winona Ryder before she even speaks. The black cat that shows up at Sparky's grave looks exactly like the Keith David voiced cat from \\"Coraline.\\" A rat is brought back to life with electricity and turns into this monster that looks nearly identical to the werewolf in \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas.\\"<br /><br />There is this fantastic story about the relationship between a boy and his dog at the center of \\"Frankenweenie,\\" but a lot of people won't be able to look past what they see as typical \\"Tim Burton fluff\\" to fully enjoy it. If you enjoyit and your friends don't, just ask them, \\"When was the last time Tim Burton had a cat in his movies who could foretell the future with its poo?\\"<br /><br />\\"Frankenweenie\\" isn't as good as \\"ParaNorman,\\" but it's certainly more charming. Tim Burton has created an enchanting animated film that is suitable for all ages that is quite possibly his most accessible film in the last decade. Amusing from beginning to end, a heartwarming relationship at its core, and its love for classic horror worn on its sleeve, \\"Frankenweenie\\" is one of Tim Burton's best.your friends don't, just ask them, \\"When was the last time Tim Burton had a cat in his movies who could foretell the future with its poo?\\"<br /><br />\\"Frankenweenie\\" isn't as good as \\"ParaNorman,\\" but it's certainly more charming.

B00514HDNW|5.0|I was rather shocked to see how much Hollywood had veered from the original storyline. Its a darned shame that a good team hadn't followed the book instead of what the movie turned out to be. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the movie but the book had so much more going for it. Don't believe me? Pick up a copy and read it.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Great Serie, Very nice, Real HD!<br />Exceeded all my expectations, Great for sharing with family or at school.<br />Each chapter is a new surprise
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a huge minecraft fan but I was a bit dissapointed with this app compared to the original Pc version. There are no caves and redstone ore generates but there is no redstone. Note that a lot of previous comments are outdated. The latest update includes crafting, mobs, creative and survival modes, beds, and all that basic stuff from the Pc.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow.  I do not write many reviews, do not have the time nor the inclination usually.  Making an exception for this series though.<br /><br />Was up 2 nights in a row reading this series, could not put it down though at 5am had to get ready for work and then spent the next night reading the rest of it.  I love it when you are on the edge of your seat until the very end.  That is a very rare talent, to keep the readers guessing till the very last page.<br /><br />Very well written and EDITED.  PLEASE BUY THIS BOOK.  You can NOT get this much ENTERTAINMENT for only $5.00.  My motives in this are very clear - I  want to read more of this world, how it came to be, how they will survive.  In order to do this, the more people that buy this, the more reviews, the better chance that Hugh will make it mainstream like Shades of Grey which is actually awful.<br /><br />Good luck Hugh, you are an amazing writer.  Thank you for 2 sleepless nights!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|After finishing the book one feels grateful and<br />proud of the SEALS who destroyed Osama Bin Laden.<br />It is important to be aware of this historic event.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The truth is, this movie was plan B for the filmmakers. It was supposed to continue directly from The Dark Knight and end with a grand showdown between Batman and The Joker but sadly this did not happen. Having said that, this movie is spectacular. For many reasons. However, I am going to cite some negatives for a moment, as I feel not enough people have acknowledged these issues. This movie is seriously loaded with plot holes and insane leaps in logic, some I still can't quite get over. I won't get into specifics just in case there a few hermits out there who never made it to the theater to see this (seriously, what's wrong with you?) and also because they're very obvious once you see the film but needless to say, there are many a ridiculous moment in this movie. That's not to say you can't overlook them and still enjoy it. I did. Millions of others did too. I absolutely love this movie. One of my all time favorites. The good significantly outweighs the bad. I can't help but wonder/wish though, what it would have been like if Heath Ledger hadn't died. Think of how THAT movie would have been. *Sigh* Oh well. No sense in dwelling on things like that. We should all be thankful Nolan and the gang even made this movie at all. He was understandably reticent at first. So thank you Mr. Nolan, and the rest of the brilliant cast and crew for giving the world  this movie. Bravo.
B0088ETCHW|5.0|From start to finish this book will help the beginner to the advanced swimmer.  Clearly written and most importantly with great results after reading you will feel as though you can master swimming to your potential.  And you will be able to discern what other swimmers are doing/not doing correctly as you make your swimming changes.  It was hard for me to tell what others were doing correctly OR incorrectly until  reading this book and now I know I can make those same changes work better for me.  THANKS, SMOOTH SWIMMING for making my swimming days more enjoyable, relaxing, and productive.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I rated the book with four stars because it was an easy exhilarating read, and I couldn't put the book down. I actually finished the book in 24 hrs at the hospital in between getting my appendix removed. What the members of DEVGRU have gone through since 9/11 gave me motivation and bravery to face down a simple surgery.<br /><br />I'll note that the book is raw written from the enlisted soldier's point of view, which makes the novel somewhat unique. The author shares what it's like to be an elite American warrior SEAL who's actually carrying out the execution of missions. (Unlike other historical war/secret mission books that are told from the officer or politician point of view and fluffed up after being screened by the Pentagon.)<br /><br />I didn't hand out a 5 star rating because as an enlisted veteran of the post 9/11 wars, I'm critical because the author wants to set the record straight, but in some of his one liner bureaucratic criticisms regarding leaking information, there's a little hypocrisy that's not acknowledged. Also, it doesn't matter if you're a super soldier in Seal Team Six, or a Private in the Air Force, or an Army Officer at the Pentagon, you should ALWAYS show respect for the Commander and Chief. (His criticisms are not slanderous, but the passive aggressive tone was distasteful when reading - and I'm not even really a Pres. Obama lover.)<br /><br />Other than the above, great read and definite buy. Please support the charities mentioned and other Wounded Warrior organizations!!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was a good read, I actually read the other two books first having seen the movie and I just wanted to see how this book compared to the big screen.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|had fun playing and am looking forward to the sequel of this app. great storyline and many hidden objects. graphics were great.
B00782O7IY|5.0|I first saw this film during a flight to NY and of course with all the in-flight announcements, extra noise, I couldn't really appreciate the whole movie.  After seeing it again last night I was absolutely blown away!  First of all the soundtrack was beautiful.  Whoever composed the music captured the tone and background of the 1920s era including even popular music from that time period.  Jean Dujardin's portrayal of movie star, George Valentin was brilliant--I never realized how difficult it must be to perform without speaking and trying to communicate with facial expressions and movements.  Berenice Bojo as Peppy Miller, the newly discovered star was just delightful in her role.  Of course, the addition of Uggie, the rescued canine made this film all the more special!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Rating: A .... Heat: Sizzling<br /><br />The Crossfire series is, in my opinion, a modern day fairytale. Sure, the handsome prince has been replaced by a handsome billionaire. The princess transformed into a socialite. And the big bad villain, well, instead of a monster to be vanquished, it's their own damaged selves that must be overcome. But it is, none the less, a realistic and contemporary fairytale... It's nearly impossible not to be swept away by Eva and Gideon as they fight for their Happily Ever After.<br /><br />And, oh boy, do they have to fight for it. Which makes every tiny success that much sweeter.<br /><br />Reflected in You takes places right where Bared to You left off. I'm really glad that there isn't a time jump. I wouldn't want to miss one single second of their romance. I'm utterly captivated (read: obsessed) by them. Addicted to them. And if I thought the first book was great--this one is even more so! Completely blew past all my expectations. Engaged me in their drama so thoroughly, you can't help but feel every sting of jealousy. Every twinge of doubt.<br /><br />And Eva is definitely put through the ringer in this installment. Some might say Eva is passive-aggressive, and maybe she is, but I also thinks she says, reacts, exactly how most women would. We all have insecurities and they're often ugly when they surface. Her reactions are organic and raw and it feels like unfiltered access to her every thought and emotion. How open she is as a narrator is one of my favorite aspects of this series.<br /><br />Gideon, on the other hand, is at the complete other end of the openness spectrum. If I thought Gideon was a puzzle, a mystery, before... Well, in this one he is even more closed up and locked down--the man practically has a vise around his emotions. Which is probably the majority (maybe half... okay, only a quarter) of his appeal. He makes you want to continually try to figure him out. That, and the fact that he is ridiculously sexy, says and does the most titillating things, and gives off that `needs the love of a good woman' vibe makes him nigh irresistible.<br /><br />Together, Eva and Gideon are making progress. Their growth is tangible and it fills you with hope, gives you a glimmer of better times to come. I'm not sure I even fully realized just how broken Eva and Gideon are in the first book, but it is shown in much more depth in this one. Probably because they are talking more and Eva has become more vocal. She's still rash, but not as quick to flee. Gideon is still unreasonable, but you see more of the motivations behind it. There is still jealousy and insecurity but, honestly, some of Gideon's behavior would drive me up a wall too.<br /><br />I felt for Eva a lot throughout. It was hard not to share her doubts about her and Gideon's relationship. Especially when so many people in her life are vocal about it and him. When they're seemingly the voice of reason, sharing doubts and concerns about Gideon. And he just does...nothing. It gave me depressing niggles of doubt too. The man needs to give reasons and explanations, at least try to justify his actions. One minute he is open and slightly vulnerable, the next he is the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz--desperately in need of a friggin' heart! And even though you sense, assume, think you know the WHY of it, it doesn't make it hurt any less.<br /><br />These two can wear you out with their ups and their downs, that's for sure, but I enjoyed every second of it. Especially their sexual escapades. Eva and Gideon's chemistry... like a lit match in a fireworks factory. They're explosive and temperamental. And Gideon has the stamina of a... I don't even know. I'd use the clich&eacute; Energizer bunny, but I think he could outlast even that. He's insatiable and I love it!<br /><br />And I must warn you: Reflected in You has within it THE hottest mile high nooky ever. Hands down. Your stomach will clench, your breath will come out in tiny little pants, andyour blood will feel like it's on fire. I really don't know how Miz Day consistently writes such wicked and wild and arousing scenes but, oh my goodness, does she ever! And, when Eva says, \\"I want to know what your fantasy is,\\" Gideon doesn't hold back. At all. Whew, the mental images still make me shiver.<br /><br />*** I trembled through another climax, my body arching with the need to feel him in me. Through the roaring of blood in my ears, I heard a voice making an announcement over the comm system, but I couldn't register the words.<br />\\"You're so sensitive.\\" Lifting his head, he licked his lips. \\"You're coming like crazy.\\"<br />I gasped. \\"I'd come harder if you were inside me.\\"<br />\\"I'll keep that in mind.\\" ***<br /><br />Reflected in You was sinfully sexy and deliciously dirty while also being so filled with emotion that my eyes were constantly leaking, releasing the excess feelings from me so that I could keep reading. I felt so much for Eva and Gideon and their struggles. And even though for every two steps forward they'd take, there was always one step back, they're still headed in the right direction.
