B00GO95BUU|3.0|I had really high expectations for The Day of the Doctor, given all the promotion and excitement leading up to it, so it's probably not a surprise that I was disappointed after watching it. In retrospect I believe the purpose of this anniversary special was more of a celebration rather than The Best Doctor Who Episode Of All Time (as I said, I had high hopes!), which makes sense but was not, in my opinion, the special we were &#34;pitched&#34;. I understand why fans are pleased with the references and inside jokes, but I've got to align myself with those who admit that the special could have been much, much more.<br /><br />The introduction we were given to Hurt's Doctor at the end of The Name of the Doctor made me expect a very dark, emotional episode that was going to make me empathize with the Doctor, and understand why Hurt's Doctor is kept tucked away in the future Doctor's memory. But, the episode was surprisingly lighthearted - hearkening back to the &#34;celebratory&#34; purpose I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />The pacing was off, there were too many filler scenes, too much quick-fire dialogue so if you miss an explanation, you're lost . . . not enough character development for Hurt's Doctor, which is a pity since this is (apparently) the only time we'll accompany him on any adventures. There wasn't much focus in the episode - it felt very scattered . . . the subplot was necessary for ONE detail that links it to the main plot, and for such a small detail, that subplot took up way too much screen time. Ten didn't always feel like the usual Ten, from facial expressions to attitude. I thought there was going to be more emphasis on the &#34;war&#34; part of The Time War . . .<br /><br />The basic mechanics of the plot are clever, there's no denying that. But I think the anniversary special tried to be too many things at once.
1401235417|5.0|This book was completely, front to back perfect. I thought hush was pretty good and haunted knight was really good but this batman story is perfect if you spend your money on any other batman book instead of this one you are using your money unwisely.
B00F91H666|1.0|I can't watch anymore.  There's so many twisted propagandist messages in here I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />Script - total joke<br />Plot - total joke<br />Brad Pitt - total joke<br /><br />Save your money for a coffee break or something.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app makes my Kindle useful 24/7. I especially love that I can fall asleep to a medley of Native American flute music and I can be  awakened by a gentle morning melody.
B001SN78JO|2.0|I personally just didn't like this movie but love Jim Carrey. But it seemed really slow and was boring too me. :( Sorry, just my opinion though. Someone else might love it.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This game holds true to many high end racing games with variety that appeals to a number of tastes. I enjoy the grind for upgrades and new rides. I also appreciate the control options and soundtrack that keep this interesting.
B00FK04JY8|5.0|I love this song she really sings so good . I think she will go far on this one. love her voice
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I tried the first experiment, and nothing happened. As the book suggested, if nothing happens feel free to stop reading it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Mojang should add flint and steel to creative. But overall a great app and super fun. You should buy this app.
B00GNIOJNC|5.0|So this song....IS AMAZING. If you are a huge directioner like me....you will love this song.  This song is upbeat and fun and just perfect
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice game  and londom nice place to pick anyways itsfun to play with othes members or friends and thabks for the game
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|The show goes without saying. And what KhubratKhan says about the barrel, etc I agree with.<br />My gripe is the outer container. What idiot decided to use rubber cement to keep the top on?  How about a clear plastic shrink band like salad dressing bottles.  Or even some plain old Scotch tape.  If one wants to protect the barrel then you want to keep the outer container.  It takes real work to not destroy it opening it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed the book. A different perspective of life; we forget at times, for those who are in a majority, the struggles so many go through, to take a breath, to walk, to smile, to love, when cancer strikes. Mostly, we forget the struggle to be real and authentic as a person... and The Fault brings us to that spot.<br /><br />We're all in this together; no one gets out alive. Love and live while you can.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a really good read. The story was excellent. Can't wait to read book two and three, of course!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love it but needs more guns and better customs. And better store menu and give the guns camo and add bows
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Huge fan. This prequel is every bit as good as the rest of the series. I am so missing teh show and the characters. It's great to have it at hand when I want a review!
B000HL0EEE|5.0|The stories are interesting, and follow an over-arching thread throughout the series, giving a satisfying fullness of depth. The characters are compelling. Jolene Blalock plays T'Pol brilliantly.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Experience the sweet sense humor King has cultivated in his 'old age'.  Thoroughly enjoyable  Entertainment fulfilled as is expected with the King of Kreepy!
B00G4I1CLS|2.0|Great and informative first 40 minutes. Then we hear the one sided biased view of ex-employees and a couple of activists. I believe whales born in captivity could display aggressive behaviors. Obviously those who work with whales can easily go to a library or rent a dvd that talks about whales to figure out that it is not the safest. But diving is not safe, neither is bungee jumping. Pups are separated from their moms for dogs and cats, yet we don't necessarily condemn it. Having visited the Monterrey Bay Aquarium, which is a research organization, and they have great programs that recover animals and release some in the wild and some are kept in display. Not every animal is able to return to the wild. Not showing this complexity nor any qualities about SeaWorld just makes this a propaganda. it is unfortunate. I thought it would be more along the lines of The Cove, where a broader set of people were heard about the topic. After watching the whales with their trainers in the movie, it made me understand that killer whales do not necessarily kill anyone. If over 30 years, a couple of people were dead, we could try to understand better what went on...  Of course, the inhumane capturing them in the wild, without reason is unacceptable.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I'm so sick of having to redo levels, they make it almost impossible to complete a level. And I refuse to spend money on a game!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I adored book 1. Book 2 was ok. Book 3 was just way too long. I didn't care to keep reading until about page 400. Then the action really kicked in. Of course it didn't end as I'd hope but that's how life can be too right? Ms Roth is an excellent writer, this is an amazing series I will continue to recommend to others, but this book was not my favorite. Wished it was a library book because I don't care to ever read it again. One pro is the story was explained pretty well why the world they live in started the way it did, and who did it which was nice to know. But I fell asleep every time I picked it up. And Four turned out to be quite a pathetic mess, which I wish he wasn't portrayed that way.<br /><br />If you love the series, read this book just so you know how it ends. But for goodness sakes, don't pay full price for the book.
B00BL9860K|5.0|Its a good read.  Sometimes a bit far fetched but  a fast paced good story line. I always enjoy David Baldacci's books.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I enjoyed the return of Jake as a lawyer trying to help out someone whom would never received help without him. In was glad it ended in the best interest of all.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|Blu Ray DVD worked well in my PS3. It has deleted scenes which I definitely didn't expect but I enjoyed. Favorite Disney movie!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I feel like I have a real horse the only problem is it has to much adds but it is still fun
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is highly recommended by me. I had great graphics and great screen zoom for a kindle. I recommend this game to everyone.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I bought this on accident and I keep getting an error that it isn't compatible with my device I wish I could return it.
B000FBJAOG|2.0|First of all this is what the title says, a guide on how to survive zombies. So don’t expect zombie attacks. Well don’t expect any zombies at all. All you will get is a discussion on different survival tactics in a “zombie” rules world.<br /><br />If you want zombies look somewhere else.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|this is the best online shooter i have seen on the market if anyone says different they are wrong there isnt a singular bad thing about it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The book is great. It is greatly written and the fact that a US writer is writing without focusing all his efforts in having US people save the world feels fresh. At least until half the book, when he demonstrates that writing narratives from other nations point of view is not his strength. Slowly we start falling into stereotypes and in the final chapters the “USA is going to save the world” speech is given.<br /><br />At least until that happens you have a wonderful and most entertaining book to read.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|don't wage your time this is stupid did you know fires don't even support youtube that's y we are having all these problems because Kiele fires are desgnied for reading only so some youtube videos don't work I hate this device now and I plan on getting money for it two
B004HXIZVC|3.0|Not exactly what I thought it would be so deleted and uninstalled after two weeks, who needs cloud sound when there is the music store on amazon with ton of music from artist from all over the world,  I like to listen to original singers not want to be singers as it appears to be on sound cloud.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can play candy crush all the time!! Thanks for making this game!! and adding new levels! I will never get bored
B00EH49DXA|5.0|Just great and powerful with meaning well put together and sang with much strength and delight.good music for the soul.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I'm amazed with this author. If I had to say anything negative about John Grisham would be that he needs to put out 3 books per year ;)<br /><br />My favorite author of all time!
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|Looks and performs just like the FREE App.  Chose this one since it said you could manage Contacts.....so far I cannot see my Contacts.....<br /><br />VERY DISAPPOINTED!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it<br />So so so much, it's so much fun.........one two three four five six seven eight nine ten
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Running Android jelly bean on Samsung s4 and this app won't register on  the device.  Have uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times but still won't work. Amazon chat support has been absolutely useless. Software works fine on Nexus 10.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Enjoy playing this game so much I find myself playing a couple times a day.  Can't wait for updates to come out.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I feel like this was well written, it continued to interesting storyline of Daniel Torrance. I have always wondered what happened to &#34;Doc&#34; after the incidents at the overlook hotel. A little boy with that much power and all those nightmares chasing him had to have a good followup story. I expected a different life for Daniel but i liked how Stephen king developed his adult character. The story kept me engaged and interested, curious to see what happens next. I would've liked to learn more about Tony however and I feel that the denouement was unnecessary. I understand the idea of &#34;what goes around comes around&#34; but feel as though the last chapter could have been omitted. Other than those I have no complaints about this book. Another great work from Stephen king. I wish he would write more along the lines of the &#34;eyes of the dragon&#34; not only was that scary but was a nail biter for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy this game and it keeps getting better.  keep bringing on new areas.  its a cool family experience trying to &quot;buy&quot; new characters.  characters are too expensive though.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|very diverse album.excellent work.Eminem does it again with another great album.Secont disc songs are also very good.nice designed case,is an cool design.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just started it today and I am at level 23. I highly recommend this game to those of you who like bejuled . Get it today . TODAY I SAY IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00FRYD6XC|4.0|Take all of the modern production value from the latest LOG album and apply it to the classic.  To be honest. I was a little worried that it wouldn't sound as raw and heavy, but my concerns were all for naught!  This is an especially good buy if you don't already own the original.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great movie very funny shipped fast was worth the money and made a great gift for my daughter thank you
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I mean. Come on. This movie is so perfect. Amazing effects and a good story to boot. Some acting and writing could have been improved, but the robots and the dinosaur-ish monsters keep you distracted enough. Watch it and love it.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Thought-provoking. A must-read for understanding the history of civilization.  Well written and presented in an easy-to-read, interesting style.  The Kindle version lacks maps.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing the game it's very addictive. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating is that when I had to update the game it took all my extra lives and I had over 80 lives accumulated. That should really be fixed. If your going to do an update it should carry over extra lives.<br />I myself have never purchased any boosters or lives but understand that other people have lost purchased items when they updated that really should be fixed.
B00280GDFQ|5.0|A marvelous, feel-good movie about the invincible human spirit in the face of incredibly daunting circumstances.  It doesn't candy coat the bitter realities of slum living, but it softens the harsh edges with a message of hope.  Great entertainment delivering some very important messages - how fortunate anyone is who lives elsewhere, other than a slum.  Count our blessings and lend a helping hand!
B00GIY5OGC|3.0|It was entertaining with the voices and music-kids liked it-good theme but kids don't want to buy so you know it is not that good
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is a fun and addicting game! I love  the new updates. I've never seen the movie but the minions make want to watch it. Lol.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is an easy read and is very informative. It was recommended to me by my dermatologist. The genetic modification of wheat is detrimental to our health. This book explains that premise in simple terms.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Fabulous book. Very well written. Changed my life . Lays out the history of the carb paradigm . Read also grain brain by David per utter
B004EPZ0AC|2.0|I liked the first movie- loved it- but just couldn't bring myself to watch the second. I lost interest quickly and early.
B005SCSL56|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time. Easy reading. Very entertaining. My 3 year liked the after stories of her princesses.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Great graphics, gameplay and story. Spent hours playing it. Simply a superb game. Lots of heroes and abilities. Great work!
B00FHATBGW|5.0|This game is a good time. It has a good storyline and you can choose to use the helpful hints if you get stuck, or are like me and are forgetful about where things need to go. Can't wait until the sequel.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 6 times and still cry at the ending. Though very different from the beloved miniseries, this is a powerful blend of cinematography, a lovely story, strong characters and beautiful music. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet has got to be my favorite of his roles ever. I love Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet; and Tom Hollander is suitably annoying as Mr. Collins. Kelly Reilly is almost snakelike as Caroline Bingley. Of course, the two principle characters are very good. Keira Knightley is saucy, and I love the scenes with Judi Dench. Matthew Macfadyen is a haughty and yummy, Mr. Darcy.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Love, love, love, love, LOVE this movie! It's full of action and suspense and keeps you hooked all the way to the end!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I don't have much to add that's new here. This miniseries gives a more detailed look at life during the early 19th century than a movie allows for. The total effortlessness of upper class life was portrayed especially well; rich people never seemed to request anything, their servants just knew what was required. The importance of restraint in society as opposed to the lack restraint in the Bennet family is also well emphasized. I, too, did not enjoy the portrayal of Mrs. Bennett; it was much too much. Mr. Collins is as annoying as he needs to be. Elizabeth is portrayed with many layers of emotion, from restraint to anguish. Mr. Darcy's portrayal is also quite good. The miniseries is very good.<br /><br />If I had seen this before I saw the 2005 movie, it would probably be my fave version of the story. Alas, I did not; that movie remains my fave.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game a lot and I need more words so I  Will say it again I like this game
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This is so far the best book on lean philosophy. It gives you actionable framework that doesn't take a long gestation period to grow on you. I strongly recommend it.<br /><br />Comparison to a few other lean philosophy books:<br />Lean Startup is good but takes a long time to get the core message across and still doesn't give straightforward implementable structure. 4 steps to ephiphany is a classic book. Some day I hope to find time to go through the book. It is great but only if I could find time.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|A fun movie for the whole family and perfect around Halloween.  In fact I bought this movie more for myself with the expectation that my daughter would watch it with me.
B00G6ZTM3Y|3.0|Pros.<br />TERARRIA IS AN AMAZING GAME.<br />there is a cool little magnifying glass thing makes for easy placement.<br />You can zoom in and out.<br />Plus.<br />Terraria is an amazing game.<br /><br />Cons.<br />Needs a jump button. For real.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Monsters University is a cute twist on the original Monsters Inc., making this movie fun for kids and adults.  We saw it twice in the theater and I can't wait to see our daughters face on Christmas morning when she opens it.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|In this moment is off the chain. Maria Brink is so hot. Guitarists and drummers are professional musicians and entertainers. Every single song on this album is really good. It's really saying something since almost every album has one or two songs you just have to skip if you follow me.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Not bad kinda predictable but a fun read. I do recommend to others.  I thought I would get all three books like wtf. It says trilogy.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's really cool! When you open it your tablet looks like a huge calculator. The colors are beautiful! And the numbers are big. Since I don't need a scientific calculator, this is PERFECT for me! Two thumbs up! ;-)
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS EPIC. I watched it when it was out in theaters - loved it. When I saw it was available for pre-order- I pulled the purchase trigger without hesitation. I waited many long weeks for the blu-ray disc set to arrive but every day waiting was well worth it.<br /><br />As per the quality of the discs- exceptional video and audio. If you're watching this on a TV without a decent 5.1 home theater set-up then you might as well return it- you dont deserve to watch it. ( I watched it on my Sony 55 HX750 with klipsch XF-48s package and the klipsch xw-300 sub)<br /><br />Granted the movie is over two hours of running time, I find it hard pressed as to what scenes could be cut out as the overall transition cut scenes were vital to relaying the story/character development.<br /><br />Henry Cavill- Awesome.<br />Michael Shannon- Awesome.<br />Russel Crowe (no big personal fan)- Awesome.<br /><br />People who complain that its not the same Superman as in the 70s/80s are right. That's stating the obvious. Different generation. I saw those Christopher Reeves editions and liked them- when I was a child. People need to grow up. They need to get over their nostalgia. That was a middle-aged version of a worn out character. This is a rebirth-  a much needed revitalization. People don't live in cartoon shells- war is war- resources are limited- difficult scenarios with limited options- Man up or go home.<br /><br />I also think its rather small minded of people to complain that the movie was nothing but CGI. A great movie consists of believable characters and deep character development, strong/plausible plot, with an appropriate resolution. For a one part installment- this movie does it all. And yes, the movie does rely heavily on CGI- we are talking about showcasing intergalactic species, intergalactic ships, cosmic battles and epic fight sequences. You cant express the strength of superman/kryptonians with mere blows to the face, a few broken ribs and shattered brick walls-the damage done must be done on a grand scale to give the viewers a glimpse of the shear magnitude of power and strength these characters possess. To have done it any other way would have been folly.<br />What set this movie apart from all the other superman movies- Superman killed. All the usual nonsensical thoughts of a super-hero with such marvelous powers of not having to kill anyone to save the greater good of mankind/species-kind are thrown out the window as they should be. Zod was an anathema. Superman recognized this- knew there was no other way- Zod would be relentless in his pursuit to destroy anything in his way in repopulating a new krypton. So superman did what he must- and I applaud Snyder on this.<br /><br />The ensemble of characters is virtually flawless. The musical score- a Hans Zimmer masterpiece.<br />This may not be an oscar winner- its not geared to that audience- but its still one hell of a movie that commands respect.<br /><br />Grow up people. rating this movie anything less than three stars is an insult to your own intelligence.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book....keeps you wanting more. Time for the next book, I know it's going to be just as good as this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I herd that there was gonna be a update on Dec.1,Nov.28,29,or the 30 and the update is 0.8.0 and in the update you can now brake Redstone and you can craft power rails,rails and those button rails and you can craft levers,iron doors,pistens,sticker pistens and other Redstone stuff.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|From the sixties on I have always had an interest in anything nuclear, both from the enormous potential for good, and the equally enormous potential for catastrophe. I knew that on several occasions the US had lost a nuclear weapon as a result of an aircraft accident or malfunction. Given the rigorous procedures and training for which the Strategic Air Command was famous, it never occurred to me that more than once we came within a hair's breadth of accidentally detonating one. This book is extraordinary on several counts. Factually, it is a real eye-opener about just how close and how often we came to nuking ourselves. Despite the extremely serious nature of the subject matter, it is also addictively entertaining. Mr. Schlosser not only knows his subject matter in depth -- he knows how to write!
1455525839|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with the book, especially after seeing all the 5 star reviews. It is probably a matter of taste, but my expectations of P&C books follow their earlier works - part macabre, part supernatural, part science fiction, etc. This book has none of that. Agent P plays a secondary role in the book, and appears briefly in and out of the story. The play between he and the \\"main \\" character leaves a lot to be desired. I really did not develop much of an interest in the main character, as she continually opens herself up to one bad situation after another. It is easy to guess who the arsonist is, and the ending comes about when the bad guy seemingly goes into brain freeze at the most inopportune time.<br />A very pedestrian effort by these 2, as they seem to follow the path of many authors who do their best work in the early years of their career. Some of their more recent offerings have been mediocre in my opinion.<br /><br />For a less capable author, this story would have been a nice effort, as it moved nicely and the scenic descriptions were done very well, putting you right there with the characters.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a well writen book in any genre and I'd recommend it for anyone to read . Indeed , it was writen before boys were being kidnapped and trained as soldiers in Africa to forward the ambitions of adults .
B005MTHRAA|1.0|I did not see anywhere on this DVD that it was in ITALIAN! I was unable to use it.  My high school kids had a good laugh though.

B001XV3LSS|4.0|Great story line with real people you can relate to. A little slow in places but overall well worth the watch even if you are not a sci fi fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is 100 good cause has a dog santa and different people this game is so fun I also play all day I mean all day not kidding
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|This was an engaging film that holds your attention. Characters are believable and the story moves right along .  Don't plan on flying the same day you watch this.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The 1st two books were very clear but the third was quite confusing...maybe it was just the war talk but it was hard to keep up with the characters and what was happening.
B001EBV0NU|5.0|Totally crazy spoof of a lot of Sci-Fi movies. I can't believe they could get so many big name actors to work in a movie like this.
B00A2H9OZS|5.0|The is by fare the best riddick movie...in the collection...great story, funny and edgie at the same time! \\"It seems like ever thing on this planet wants a peice of me\\"!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|It's an excellent movie. One that asks questions about the so-called battle between science and religion. Carl Sagan when writing thiis book had his own very personal reasons for asking questions as to the meanings of life/universe/God.

B001BR5NH6|4.0|For it's genre, it's a good flick. Teenage boys can be just this weird if not more so. Cutting through all the blatant sexual references, there is an underlying moral to the story.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love dungeon crawlers. This game seems to be pretty good can't wait to play some more.  It reminds me of diablo
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|Having so enjoyed Red, I was skeptical that a sequel could match the wry wit, exciting action and chemistry that the first troupe had.  I was more than thrilled that Red 2 had as much pizazz as the first movie.  When so many action films take themselves seriously to point of embarrassment, the tongue in cheek Red movies bring a refreshing mix of serious fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. Love the graphics. I just updated and love the new location. Keep up the great work. Please continue to add new locations keeps the game from being boring.
0399246665|3.0|Some of the pages were blank, others were turned upside down, so 2 of the books were defective. They are meant as a mix and match between the upper and lower part of the book (match the shape with the object for instance). So not quite suitable for a 1 year old.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I love pigs. PIGS ARE MY BUDDIES.This game is gust Good for me. Minecraft pigs any kind. PIGS are cute
B00ARPMIJE|4.0|This was really heart-warning. You really feel like you're right there with the characters! But I really fell in love with Maude and Matt, with their mixed up romance. It was just wow!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! easy gameplay but challenging minions are the coolest thing ever. I just wish that it wasn't. so difficult to get gru coins
B00CDTSFF8|4.0|This and is not based on real history. Ragnar was a real man and so was Rollo. The costuming for the Vikings was top notch. I am no Sir L. Olivier, but I would say the acting was pretty decent and was at a level demanded by the show's subject. I didn't give it 5 stars because just like in the 1959 movie The Vikings, to creat a separation between Anglo-Saxon people and particularly warriors the screw around with things in order to present them as some sort of unified, civilized Christian culture, In the 8th century most Anglo-Saxons were Christian...true, but they were as fierce as the Vikings, beat them many times and really didn't look a whole lot different than they did. What's with the fancy uniform like armor? Anglo-Saxons didn't have uniforms. With akll the examples of Anglo-Saxon battle hemets and armor they couldn't have come up with something better that the silly outfits they gave them? ONLY the Huscarls would have been uniform like that. Watch &#34;Beowuld and Grendel&#34; with the dude from 300. There you will see real looking Anglo-Saxon warriors. The Anglo-Saxons were no less violent than the Vikings, fought with the same weapons and pretty much looked the same except for some superficial differences. Finally. Anglo-Saxon warriors DID NOT fight from horseback. They rode to battle and fought on foot...in guess what...a shield wall or a Boar's Head offensive formation. The show is like a term paper where the first part is brilliant and the second part is bollocks. Hollywood, you failed to score the big one with this drama like you have every early Medieval movie you've ever done. Too bad.

149228856X|4.0|For the third time, I now have read The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.<br /><br />The book is as predictable as it gets because of the multitude of adaptations to the story through films. It’s so oft familiar because the behaviors that are characterized in the book resemble bipolar disorder the most. Once you know what the symptoms of the disorder are, there is no need to read The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.<br /><br />All in all, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is certainly Robert Louis Stevenson’s most famous book ever although I think Treasure Island remains his greatest work which is a must-read for all ages.
B003G4W49C|4.0|After seeing the movie with my son I decided to read the book to better understand the characters and I'm so glad I did. The book is a hundred times better.

B009MYAQOA|5.0|It's very hard today to imagine that two married people leaving their respective spouses to live out their love for each other could cause a scandal of the scope that resulted from the relationship between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick and the media's treatment of it.  But Nancy Horan successfully transports the reader back to the beginning of the 20th century, with all its sounds, smells, technologies and, above all, mores.  Her well-written historical interpretation captures the interminable unfolding of the event over time, ranging from the differing moral reactions to it by a wide array of people both in the United States and abroad to the couple's own doubts, convictions, strengthens, weaknesses and complex personalities, including Borthwick's ongoing search for her own separate identity in a time when a woman's identity was socially limited to being a wife and mother.  Equally interesting subthemes include the issues and debates of the women's movement on both sides of the Atlantic and of course the esthetic of Wright's architectural vision.

B006Q1SQCQ|3.0|Has some good techniques but most of the book is devoted to doing things that most people aren't ever going to need to do, like memorizing long lists of unrelated numbers. The more advanced techniques involve memorizing rather complicated (to me at least) list of things that will trigger your memory about other things. Might be good for a medical student or someone else that needs to memorize many things.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|This movie was a huge &#34;meh.&#34; The story was not tight at all, and they relied way too heavily on the &#34;going back to basics&#34; approach.<br /><br />The premise of the movie (that Bond is too old for this shit) was not well executed, and did not fit with the culture of Bond, anyway. He's been around for decades - he doesn't get tired. He's always Bond. That's part of his character, and this movie broke that some.<br /><br />*Mild Spoilers*<br /><br />The distinct lack cool gadgetry made this even less a Bond movie than the above. The biggest tech toy was a tiny radio about 1&#34; square, that actually looked like a little handheld radio, complete with telescoping antenna. Beyond retarded.<br /><br />*End Spoilers*<br /><br />The action was not exciting, and much of it seemed out of place. The acting was okay, but the material they were working with was lack-luster. All of the &#34;experienced field agents&#34; (including Bond) acted like they were new and didn't know how to carry themselves. Even the main villain, while his introduction scene was particularly good, was weak (character-wise) and inconsistent.<br /><br />That said, It's not on the level of Meet the Feebles or Wolverine, so it doesn't deserve a 1 star rating. Die hard Bond might like it (or utterly hate it). Overall, I would not recommend anyone to watch it.

I bought Gone Girl and it got great reviews and I'm looking forward to it.

B00B6OVOAO|5.0|This is my favorite of all Nigella's books. Her prose is as delicious as her recipes. The book reads like a novel. It's a rare cookbook that brings tears to the eyes, but Feast did just that with its unexpected final section on funeral feasts. But the words must compete with the recipes for top honours, because the recipes are outstanding as well.<br /><br />I admit to being partial to the baked goods. Among the highlights for me here are the chocolate gingerbread (now a Christmas tradition for me), Buche de Noel and pumpkin cheesecake.  Toblerone fondue is obvious but awesome.<br /><br />Among the savoury, I liked her peculiarly named &#34;back from the bar snack&#34; (cheesy potatoes), bubble and squeak and Stilton rarebit.<br /><br />I'm leaving out tons of recipes included here that I loved reading, but can't try because I'm vegetarian. But this is a long book, so there's something for everyone!

B001I45UFC|3.0|I read the Narnia books about a year ago, but I had already seen the movies. The the thing about movies based on books, is that if you read the book first it will probably seem better than the movie, and vise-versa. I really enjoyed this book, but, personally, I liked the movie better, that's just my opinion.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good game. Nice time killer. But it would be better if money was easier to make within the game & it wasn't just another credit buy pit. Would also be nice if there wasn't so much urging for facebook interaction. Not everyone wants to post every insignificant thing they do. It'll do for free but I'd rather pay up front for the game & not have to deal with the credit buying/or waiting hours for funds to regenerate. Not nearly as good as Majesty or Townsmen.
B00GS1DM2S|4.0|Fourteen years have passed since Third Impact was unexpectedly thwarted, yet the Angels continue their attacks against mankind. Shinji Ikari is salvaged from Evangelion Unit-01 and finds that things have changed, but not for the better: the world has been utterly devastated, his former allies from NERV have become hostile toward him, and Rei Ayanami, the girl Shinji risked everything for, is nowhere to be found. As he attempts to adjust to this strange new world, Shinji befriends the enigmatic Kaworu Nagisa. Together the pair learns the terrible truths behind the Angels, NERV, and the Evangelions. With only Kaworu to support him and the entire world against him, Shinji must now fight to bring balance to the world around him.<br /><br />Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo is a film about personal redemption. It is a film that is centered on the element of understanding one's own past wrongdoings and being able to confront those wrongs in an attempt to free oneself from the past. It is a film about honestly taking a step towards understanding the world around you and how one's past actions can greatly affect those you care for. But it is also a film showcasing how one can easily fall back upon the same actions that led to those past transgressions in an attempt to address the problems they face in the present. It is also a film that delivers substantially more questions than answers.<br /><br />For those accustomed to the universe of Neon Genesis Evangelion (1995), or are simply familiar with the previous two films in the Rebuild series, You Can (Not) Redo is a film that largely departs from such familiarity with considerable awareness. Unlike the television series, The End of Evangelion (1997), or Rebuild films released prior, You Can (Not) Redo presents a new take on the universe of Evangelion as a whole, inserting new elements within its narrative and expanding the scope of the series as whole. From the opening moments of the film, we are thrust into a foreign world in which we have absolutely no understanding of, with longtime fans and mere newcomers being equally as puzzled. We as viewers are similar to Shunji Ikari's current predicament--he awakens to a world unlike the one he left, with the people and places he once knew now changed, lost, or simply forgotten.<br /><br />With such a premise, it would be a complete understatement to say that You Can (Not) Redo is a very, very dark and bleak film. It is also a slow and methodical viewing experience, particularly during the middle portion of the film, easing us as viewers into a world of increasing unfamiliarity. There is very little action throughout a majority the film as well, with most of it occupying the opening and concluding portions of the film. If the conclusion of Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance (2009) was just a glimpse of the chaos to come, then You Can (Not) Redo veers completely into the dark recesses of the Evangelion universe. The film is pretty much devoid of any of the humorous elements found in prior films in the series, especially as seen in You Can (Not) Advance, but then again, this film is loosely based upon the final episodes of the television series, which consisted highly upon the philosophical and introspective interactions of its characters. Gone are the days of innocence: no humorous verbal battles at school, cooking bouts in order to gain affection, or gratuitous fan service on part of the female cast. Here we find the characters less sympathetic and overall well adjusted to the dire nature of their existence, both as individuals and members of humanity. These characters have been through a quite lot while Shinji was gone--much of what remains unknown to us as viewers--but it is expressed through their approach towards Shinji and his surprising reappearance. Rather than be joyous at his return, they despise him, looking to him as a burden and the source to their unnecessarily elongated battle to save the world.<br /><br />With this in mind,You Can (Not) Redo is a film that spends a majority of its time focused on the plight of Shinji Ikari. Like stated earlier, it is a film primarily dealing with the element of redemption, with Shinji being the one to question his role as an Eva pilot and how his own selfish actions led to the destruction of what he held most dear to him. The film spends much of its time within the sparse and isolated landscape of NERV's GeoFront, which was heavily damaged when Shinji initiated Third Impact in the conclusion of the previous film. Seemingly in a way to physically exemplify his atonement, it is in this barren, secluded environment where Shinji contemplates what he has done given the aftermath of Third Impact, witnessing firsthand the physical destruction brought about by own deeds. Like the previous film in which Shinji viewed the destructive onslaught and aftermath of the Angel Zuriel, here we find the tables have indeed turned.<br /><br />But as so much attention is given towards Shinji's current predicament, many of the film's other characters do not fair too well in terms of being influential factors within the film's narrative. Given the rather significant departure from the traditional narrative structure brought about by the two previous films, the lack of character development is even more pronounced in You Can (Not) Redo than even those films. Previously key characters such as Misato, Gendo, Mari, Rei and Asuka are provided little to any time for actual development here, instead being delegated to estranged positions of affronting Shinji off at any available opportunity. Other characters are strangely absent from the film as well. This is certainly surprising to see, but it further establishes the bitter and cold world Shinji finds himself in, even if we want more from the characters we have all grown accustomed to through the prior films.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the narrative of You Can (Not) Redo can't exactly be viewed in a similar vein. Given the time-leap of fourteen years, the narrative find itself in a perpetual state of catching up to inform the viewer as to what is actually going on, which is helpful, but writer and director Hideaki Anno also decides to throw in so many new plot elements that the end result will simply compound upon the confusion of the average viewer. It is not that the film is difficult to comprehend; it is rather the amount of information that one will need to decipher through to completely understand the entirety of it. Unlike the previous two films, You Can (Not) Redo is a film that will require more than one viewing in respect to the massive narrative scope that Anno presents, an audacious approach that one can imagine will make for a difficult and perplexing viewing experience for many out there.<br /><br />This approach also does not alleviate the film from running into, shall we say, \\"awkward moments,\\" specifically on part of the viewing audience gaining some simple understanding as to what is actually going on. I use the term awkward here to signify several moments within the film where Shinji, by simply pursuing to ask more questions than he does, could resolve so much and avoid a ton of rather unnecessary expository sequences (an unfortunate approach that permeates most of the film). Simple inquiries such as repeatedly asking what transpired during the fourteen years when he was trapped in Eva-01, why is NERV deemed an enemy now, and how come a practically inoperable NERV headquarters can still function with little-to-no staff, would have been beneficial in more ways than one in explaining to us as viewers some fundamental elements of the plot. These and similar questions could have all been answered if Shinji would have just inquired more from the individuals he interacts with, instead leaving much of us in the dark for a remainder of the film. This aspect of the characterization of Shinji may have been warranted given his current perplexed state of mind in parallel to that of theviewers' own, but it does not necessarily help out in terms of having a more focused narrative. Also, looking intently at the character of Kaworu, an individual that has been continually promoted as a significant figurehead within the Rebuild film series, remains just as mysterious and allusive by the film's end as he did in the previous films. One would hope for him to finally develop more as a character here, but he doesn't appear as dynamic as a character as we would initially perceive him as, which doesn't necessarily help in establishing his role as a prominent individual within the Evangelion universe.<br /><br />But characterization aside, the animation of the film remains a highlight. Like the actual narrative of the film itself, the visual quality of You Can (Not) Redo is also very dark as well, offering a stark contrast to the color palette of the previous films. Whether this is viewed in the decaying interiors of a destroyed GeoFront, to the elaborate and bizarre inner workings of Central Dogma, to the skyward battles of the Wunder, the look of the film is impeccably polished to say the least. There is also a brilliantly animated piano sequence that is shared between Kaworu and Shinji that is sure to appease piano enthusiasts and classical listeners alike. Out of all the films released thus far though, this film utilizes CGI the most, which may be a hit or miss with some viewers. Despite this approach though, Studio Khara is quite elaborate in their construction and detail of all the CGI sequences within the film, doing an overall wonderful job in regards to implementing them into the film. The opening space battle and final battle within Central Dogma are absolutely phenomenal displays of their technical prowess, continuing the tradition of being a studio that can truly deliver superb animation alongside an aesthetic experience.<br /><br />Another striking element of the film is the music. Composer Shiro Sagisu, a man well known for his work on the Evangelion series as well as other popular anime series and films, delivers a fantastic score that is both unique and fitting given the awe-inspiring nature of You Can (Not) Redo. While the two previous films offered a reinterpreted range of music that stemmed mostly from the original television series alongside several compositions from past Anno-affiliated animated works, the score for You Can (Not) Redo consists of primarily new arrangements that nicely encapsulates the emotional mood of the film. With thunderous drums and powerful choruses, one can see that Sagisu truly surpasses himself here in terms of musical ability, delivering an astute reflection upon the grandiosity of the film itself.<br /><br />Considering the substantial changes that are within You Can (Not) Redo, one cannot deny the impressive interpretation of the Evangelion universe that Anno has established with this film. While many of the characters don't receive as much development as one would hope, one can view this film as essentially all about Shinji coming to terms for his past transgressions. This approach will certainly alienate some viewers, perhaps even discourage them from fully enjoying the film, but it is an approach that provides a uniquely compelling outlook towards how we may cumulatively understand the series as a whole. While some viewers criticized Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone (2007) for appearing simply as a rehash of the original television series, one can predict that some viewers will criticize You Can (Not) Redo for quite the opposite reason--its interpretation of the original series is entirely too different. There is much material here to contemplate and debate though, which is something that Evangelion fans have a particular knack for. For better or worse, Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo remains a broodingly tragic, surreal, and emotional experience, even if its complexity may get the better of it at times. Let's hope that the final film will provide some answersto the numerous questions raised within this film, in turn offering adequate closure to one of the biggest anime film series in the last decade.viewers' own, but it does not necessarily help out in terms of having a more focused narrative.

B009GEYX5E|1.0|This film is horrible.  The only thing this shares with the original is that it fits in the camera.  The picture quality is soooooooooo bad, dark & ghost like, with the flash or without, indoors or out, terrible quality.  They truly should not be allowed to sell this this garbage.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|To me, this movie rates up there with district 9 -great story and special effects - will watch it again & again
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|Good... Not Great. This is the second game I play from this developer. While I loved 'Factory Ball', this one wasn't on the same level.<br />The concept is terrific, but as some have said, drawing crude lines to make the sugar fall as needed can be tedious. It takes patience and concentration to figure out the best way to finish a level. The final levels seem impossible at times, but it's worth figuring out. If I hadn't realized I was on the final level however, I would have quit the game.  Overall, I'm happy I got this when it was free app of the day.

0316055433|5.0|&#34;The Goldfinch&#34; deserves high marks for the sheer pleasure of reading it.  In fact, I'd love to re-read it at some point, when I have the time to gulp it down hundreds of pages at a time, as I think that's how it deserves to be, and should be, read.  Unfortunately, I started it at a time when I was insanely busy and only had time to read it 20 pages at a time, with an occasional 50 or so; however, I never lost interest in it and was always delighted to pick it up again (despite its weight!)<br /><br />I heard Ms. Tartt on NPR or elsewhere talking about her love for Dickens, and her book honors him in untold ways.  Aside from being a wonderful read, her evocations of New York City are in every way as brilliant as Dickens's of London (though I know New York far better than I do 19th Century London!).  I am one of those people who don't like Las Vegas, and I haven't been to Amsterdam in years, but in both cases she captures what I remember (and both like and dislike) about both cities.<br /><br />I wouldn't say the book is long on plot, but it held my interest through all but the last 25 or so pages.  The hero, his tragedy, his peregrinations, and the fascinating, idiosyncratic people he meets along the way, were more than enough to keep me reading.  As others have noted, the ending was somewhat disappointing - inconclusive and a bit pontificating - but in a way it was a suitable ending given all that had gone before.<br /><br />As a postscript, I should point out that I was one of those people who did not like &#34;The Secret History.&#34;  Perhaps it was the fact that I read it as our daughters were going off to college, and the haughtiness of late adolescence (as well as the excesses in which the characters engaged and the horrible things they did) did not appeal to me.  So when &#34;The Goldfinch&#34; started getting rave after rave, I was highly skeptical.  However, it's a keeper - and by that I mean something that will stay on my shelves and, hopefully, be re-read.e re-read.
B00G4ZACLC|5.0|The images are the hardest to remember . . . but still I love it too.<br /><br />By the way &#34;Why does this app put me to sleep&#34;?
B009LDCZ7I|2.0|This show was over for me the moment when, at Season Two, CIA agent Quinn is shot and left for dead on the ground, blood coming out of his mouth. And then... surprise! The writers wrote one of the oldest scenes in the book: the guy simply discharges himself from hospital, at will. Yes, after being shot apparently on the belly. He just let loose the medical equipment, put his clothes and from then on deal with the shot wound with some painkiller pills. As new and fresh as he has ever been in his life...<br /><br />This led the show into \\"24\\" territory.<br /><br />Over for me.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Now as for this app . . . I have to admit, &#34;I live for the challenge&#34; . . . nuf said bout dat.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|You don't have to know The Shining to enjoy this sequel, but you will want to read it by the time you're done. Supernatural worlds that overlap our reality and don't involve sparkly vampires or sexy werewolves (not that there's anything wrong with that).
B004UID2LC|5.0|Now this one is my favorite . . . but just because it is for You Tube, I still use other down load other apps.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun and easy game. Great graphics and easy storyline. So glad this has finally been made available for kindle systems.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|After finishing the prize-winning orphan masters son, I was curious about a non-fictionalized account of life in North Korea. I read this book in about five days, was moving, terrifying, and very beautifully reported
B00AREIAI8|4.0|If only it could be modes realistic! Would love to have more control in competition mode. But love it forming and feeding modes. Maybe add grooming tools you could buy and have the seasons change.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|A real eye opener for anyone who suspected Roswell really happened. Well worth the time to read. Are you ready for the truth?
B00008G8LG|3.0|A well acted movie with great scenery. Not sure if Jodie Foster won an oscar, but should have. All the children were very nice as well.
B00ET47USI|4.0|Lots of fun.<br /> Greatest graphics.  Fast response.  I have been playing for quite a long time.  This is the best so far.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game so much! It is a puzzle and you try getting out of different rooms and it is hard but fun! I recommend this game to people who like  this kind of stuff
B008LXZFH6|1.0|I was warned it was going to be full of stupid humor; I just wasn't prepared for the total lack of anything funny.  I'm glad I rented it though so I don't have to see part two in theaters for $15.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's an awesome game I love it soooooooooooo much!!!!!!!!!!<br />I love it soooooo much I play it all the time!!!
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|The saying is so true! Never capture what you can't control! Man's quest to lord over all life on this planet will be his undoing! This is a must watch documentary!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was a great read with an amazing twist in the middle.  It kept me wanting to read it til I was done.
0804162727|5.0|The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds - Collectors Edition Game Guide<br /><br />  Hard on the heels of the releases of Nintendo's latest game in the Zelda franchise - \\"A Link Between Worlds\\" - Prima Publishers has issued a companion game guide in a collectors edition.<br /><br />  For this amateur gamer I find these Prima guides indispensable. The guide is an encyclopedia of walk through helps, location of hidden items and hint for solving puzzles and defeating various evils doers. Numerous world maps in the back of the book are keyed with locations of places to visit, to avoid, and treasure locations and temples.<br /><br />  You certainly don't need a guidebook to play this game. Some folks feel a guide detracts from the challenge of solving the various riddles and defeating the bosses. I find having the guide very helpful when I reach a dead end, but that's one person's opinion.<br /><br />  The collector's edition is a large hardbound book measuring 8.5 inches by 11, gilt edged and 320 pages long. The cover boards are light green with a stylized gold border with a Zelda/Triforce design imprinted on the front cover. To my knowledge this is the fifth Zelda Collectors Edition published by Prima - the only difference is the other editions is the color of the hardbound boards.<br /><br />  Highly recommend as an attractive Legend of Zelda collectable and a useful companion to a challenging game.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I think everyone should get this because you can remove junk files and get more space!!! I rate this 5 stars for how awesome this is!!!  :)
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|its not easy to play the app you have too be smart and a good fighter so get the app
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am probably  one of a few readers who read the two books back to back. And to me its like two different authors. I can only think that many things change or mature us. I have discovered Stephen King 25  years after my wife bought everything he wrote but I wouldn't t touch due to  a fear of nightmares if I read them. I'm glad I waited .  Now I can appreciate the gift that is unique to the world of literature.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This my favorite app on Kindle Fire right now. There is always something to do owithout being gaudy. The graphics are gorgeous. Well done.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Not what I expected after the first two books. I did not like the ending. I would have like more drama and suspense.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This novel sucked me in, I was its silent observer.  Watching Ender's life full of dreadful sorrow for him, Orson Scott Card can breath life into his work. He has engendered my favorite story; one more deep,  intuitive, and more completely interwoven than I had the hope to expect.
B00FG5FRG6|5.0|It is just an amazing movie, we don't really know what going to happen with ours life, even if we have the oportinity to make a choice.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Awesome book, I loved it!  Marcus and his team are absolute heroes!!  Much respect for the Seals!  It's a must read.
B00000JAD6|5.0|This is one of the all-time best recordings - by anyone, ever. It has a good combination of solos and group stuff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun! I cant get enough of this game. Definitely reccommened to anybody,  who wants a game made for fun times when your bored.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|If you're reading this review, then you already know this movie is awesome.<br /><br />Blu-ray plus a good system makes the all-time great soundtrack really rock the house.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad you finally made it for the kindle fire.it's my favorite game and its hours of fun to play.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It is difficult to see the puzzle pieces in the 'tray' using the Kindle. It is an interesting 'time-passer' .
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|asdf here I think pool is cool because you get to hit the ball win pool coins and do mini games
B00136S0NE|5.0|I can not get enough of this soundtrack.  An incredible movie... a moving and emotional soundtrack.  I absolutely love the talent of these two amazing artists.  Only occasionally can you experience such amazing talented duos.  Amazing.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This seems to be a good game however I have not tried full choices. But what I.have played was good
0711986746|5.0|Great book!  The author was the closest person to Freddie & gives an honest respectful account of his time with him.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Scribble naunt is a good game . I just love it . It uses creative Ness and is a challenge
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's story and journey into death and back is inspiring. I have gifted this book to many family members. This book remains one of my favorites in my spiritual book library.<br /><br />We are all, as a species, conditioned to be fearful of death and the dying process. Yet, as she explains, we needn't be. If ever there was a book that explained what our true purpose was, this is it. Maybe the best experiential book on NDE out there.<br /><br />Anita Moorjani is one of the most compassionate people and I have watched many of her talks on YouTube. She is authentic and loving.
B000F3T7R4|5.0|Still my favorite Whitesnake album ever. A rollicking joyride through the landscape of rock and roll in the late 1970's. Blending blues with the sound popularized by Zeppelin and Deep Purple (from which came both David Coverdale and Jon Lord), this is the record for Whitesnake fans to hear. This is not the radio friendly Americanized Whitesnake, but the hard-rocking original. No teased hair or spandex here, just straightforward rock and roll. Forced to pick highlights, I would list the opening track &#34;Take Me With You&#34;, &#34;Love to Keep You Warm&#34;, and the wonderfully twisted cover of the Beatles &#34;Day Tripper&#34;, but there is no way to separate them from the rest. This disc includes the &#34;Snakebite&#34; EP in it's entirety, an addition that only makes it better. Put it on, turn it up, and enjoy.
B0060AY6FO|2.0|This book is really more of a 19th century murder mystery than a sequel to Pride and Prejudice,  I would have preferred a book that focused on crime investigation in the 19th without the subterfuge that it furthered the story of beloved characters, who, at best, are only there for local color.
B000EXZDOQ|4.0|A must for hard rock fans, this was the breakthrough album for the British incarnation of Whitesnake. While the earlier albums were well-received, this one produced their first real hit, the original version of &#34;Fool for Your Loving&#34; which was re-recorded for their American audiences some eight years later. One of my favorite albums (back in the vinyl days) this was one of the best albums of the time. Bluesy rock with the innuendo one would expect from the audacious Coverdale and company. The bonus tracks, one unreleased and three live renditions just make this collection better. Don't miss &#34;Sweet Talker&#34; and &#34;Black and Blue&#34;. Hard to pick a distinct highlight, as every song is good. Top notch stuff all around.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Common in show-business. Good to use if you wanna hear what many in recording industry hear. If you look at camera men in tv shows you will regocnize this ear phone many times. Not an extraordinarily great sounding headphone but common and good for that reason.
B000K2Q5X4|4.0|Another of the great albums that time forgot. When Whitesnake was first introduced to the United States, they were largely overlooked by the mainstream music scene. This should have been the record to change that. Alas, it required a complete revamp and a loss of the originality that this album provides to break through to the spandex-and-hair crowd. THIS is what the 'Snake was about, crunchy blues and driving rock and roll. The title track and &#34;Wine, Women, and Song&#34; should have been their initial big hits in the States, bouncing the listener along like a hayride through the countryside, grinning ear-to-ear. The tongue-in-cheek innuendo reminds one of Aerosmith, but the music is handled with much more diversity and grace. Fans of either should enjoy this. If you only know the hits that Whitesnake put out, this might just show you the light of what they should have always been.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I said I would never play, then I played and said I'd never become addicted. Well I have 2 games going; on my phone AND now on my Kindle. Need I say more.
B005FNJL7K|4.0|Having searched for a video of this symphony for a long time, I decided that an audio version was good enough and was well-rewarded. Fans of the film trilogy who don't like symphony music might get bored, but true music lovers will love this. Howard Shore's composition is brilliant and his reworking of a film theme into a full symphony is nothing short of genius. There are a few pieces listed as  &#34;not included&#34; which is a bummer, but what is here is great. Still looking for a comprehensive version, complete with the artists rendering of scenes stated to have been projected behind the orchestra during the performance, but this beats having nothing.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, but I guess it left me a little sad that all the characters were somehow betrayed or tricked  by life and left to make sense of it.  That's why I gave it the four stars out of five<br />I bought two more of Liane's books and have one on my wish list, so I will be interested in seeing what her other books are like.
B0091XOE36|5.0|P.T. Anderson had been my favorite director ever since I saw this movie about 10 yrs ago for the first time. This movie is so close to my heart - I can't even describe how much I can relate to every single character. I don't think this magic can ever be repeated - but if it will be, it has to be by P.T. Anderson or someone who can think exactly like him.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really am entertained by the entire cast of characters.  Of course who wouldn't love Harvey for just being himself and the sweet Mike and I must admit that Louis is growing on me in some kind of odd way.<br />The writing is crisp and refreshing.<br />Oh and I don't want to leave out Donna (wish I was her in my earlier life) Jessica for being a strong woman and Rachel for just being believable.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google never ceases to surprise me. This is one company that slowly keeps doing what it does best - make people's lives so much better with its amazing products. When other companies out there are coming up with boxes (Roku, TiVo etc.) and what not that they want you to connect to your TV (which is probably already bearing the weight of a ton of other boxes), Google understood exactly what a consumer needs - and that is less confusion. The device promises casting content that is displayed either on your web browser or Chromecast-participating apps (the list will keep growing) to a TV with ZERO hassle. Let me repeat that again - ZERO HASSLE.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great story.  Great author. Very plausible plot. Very we'll written in my opinion.  I enjoy all his books.  He keeps you wanting not to put the book down
B00EPFEY44|5.0|The very best voice. I purchased it because I have seen the concert in live. It is superb to have both the CD and DVD. High quality of both discs, excellent delivery, and very fast shipment. I have them all. Strongly recommend this company.
B00EQRP5LW|5.0|Amazing CD from John Legend....I'm impressed!!!!! I've always been a JL fan; this CD continues to allow me to remain a true fan.
B0048EANOM|5.0|You couldn't find better movie to represent so well the dark side of our political history happen in 1963. Excellent plot and cast, outstanding way to show the tragedy and political intrigues at that time, shocking. Well, This is Oliver Stone... Movie came in an excellent condition, packing, and fast delivery. Strongly recommend both the seller and the movie as well.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Love my new Nook HD reader.  Great to get books on line, no more shopping in the stores w/ all the crowds, Thanks Amazon
6305692572|5.0|I purchase this wonderful movie for many personal reasons. The movie came on time, in great condition as described in the add. Well packed it came in great shape. I enjoyed it a lot and strongly recommend this seller.
B00000K3D4|4.0|David Bowie is far out in this move,he makes the whole show. I like fantasy type shows, the characters are awesome, and the music makes it fun.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|I have the original film with Robert Redford. I missed this one on the big screen and with hesitation purchased this new version. Iwas nicely surprised by the movie and great acting. All discs came in excellent condition package, it came way before deadline, well packed. I like the seller and highly appreciate the business.
B005D4YOV4|5.0|perfect sandal,my second pair would purchase again, another color would be nice, I love the compfort of this sandal.Keen is the best
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I find it fun to play but no pearls means no gift from the chest. Very educational and good for kids.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|I enjoy dog stories,would be a great movie for all dog lovers, is a little sad,but a wonderful movie. buy this movie
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Cute game .... love the graphics. Just wish there was an easier way to get gems and coins. Overall it's a nice clean little game.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|This has some scary moments, but I am starting to wonder when the creators of the PA films are going to stop giving us more of the same.  I truly enjoyed the first three as they chilled and thrilled me.  However, this franchise is starting to remind me of a trip to a local haunted house on Halloween.  We expect to be scared, and because the tricks are the same each year, we leave going &#34;That was fun&#34; instead of &#34;That was terrific!&#34;--literally and figuratively.  Cleverness has been replaced by formula, and I am disappointed--even though I will probably give in and take a look at PA 5 with the hope that something new will pop out of the shadows.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|It would not load.  I wasted my money on a movie I could not watch.  Amazon needs to rectify this.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|This is the real deal.  For those of us over 40 our understanding of Superman comes from the 50's and for the rest of us it comes from cheesie Debra Winger movies but in this outstanding retelling we are introduced to him as he actually is - a baby sent from Krypton who lands in Kansas and is raised to be the man of steel, faster than a speeding bullet, etc.  This is a sci-fi movie not a fantasy film.<br /><br />This portrayal must have come about after a pitch meeting in which someone had the brains to say, &#34;We can't just redo Superman.  We need to tell his story.&#34;  HIS story.  And he's an alien.  So this is a story about an alien who is raised by humans and while Earth is being attacked by similar aliens it is Superman who proves not just that he's a good alien but an American one at that.  Superman is all you could want out of both a sci fi movie and a superhero movie.  Gone are the stupid scenes where we all know Clark is Superman and wonder why in the hell Lois can't figure that out.  This movie is logical.  It was well thought out and puts to rest all the logical continuity problems of all previous attempts.  It was truly enjoyable and worth every cent.
0764169742|5.0|One of the best texts for botanical drawing. Clear, colorful, concise, detailed.........and easily understood and illustrated. Love nature, drawing or colored pencil? You'll truly enjoy this book. I certainly did.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game with a lot of levels and people (aka) minions all I can say is a great game:)
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|First I was hooked on #1 and now I'm hooked on #2. Can't put it down half the time. Even played it in the doctor's office for 2 hours while waiting for an emergency delayed appointment.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|This is a gift and I know he will be thrilled with it.  He is a HUGE fan.  It was a great deal and I couldn't pass it up.
0321934318|5.0|Great book.  Wonderful instructions and photos.  Easy to follow and organized.  This would definitely be the one book to own for Lightroom 5.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|If you are in or have ever served in the military, read this book! You will understand once you read it. One of the best reads of my life.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|The director still has too many scenes where Bond is running all over the place and I miss the old  James Bond Gadgets and wise cracks.  At least this one had a little humor  Having the old Austin Martin in was a nice twist although they made sure that it wouldn't be back.  &#34;M&#34; will certainly be missed.  But the new &#34;M&#34; should be excellent.  I believe he starred as one of the avengers with Sean Connery playing the villain and &#34;Mrs. Steel&#34; was the new &#34;M's&#34; lovely and sexy accomplice. The next James Bond Should be even better
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Sucked... The trailer was much better than the movie!  Loved the concept, but the storyline was pathetic.  Why do they keep using the same writers, or in this case, mimicry is not the most sincerest form of flattery.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Okay but all the actors are trying to out do the other. Rather than looking like part of the plot it came off as too realistic.  I believe there was real animosity among them that was showing up in their acting.  It distracted from the move.  Captain American was still acting like the &#34;Human Torch.&#34;. The movie came off a little hokey for me. At least the movie was named Iron Man IV.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing simply amazing even better than the movie I loved every bit of it and at the end of each chapter Susan Collins had me on the edge of my seat!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is perfect for filling time spent in a waiting room or as a passenger on a road trip. It has just the right amount of fun with plenty of strategy, but the core game play is simple enough for a four year old to play. It has great cross platform support with availability in the Apple app store, Google play, Amazon apps, or through flash on Facebook in your internet browser(i use it on the galaxy s4, iPad 2, kindle fire HDX, and my Windows 8.1 laptop). The Developers hit a home run with this title and I would love to see it in the Windows app store.
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet you're seriously missing out. Anyone who complains or complained about this movie is naive and foolish. Don't listen to them. Be your own judge and you'll agree, GREATEST SUPER HERO MOVIE EVER!!!
0307720748|1.0|I rated this book one star because I've never actually read the look until recently.  A haircut would go along way, a trim really would make it easier to spit out what needs to be said.  He's got a certain animal magnetism, doesn't he?!  A literal growl.  (And since no one has given the book one star - I wanted to draw attention to it so I gave it one star so people would take notice.... otherwise they might go a lifetime without noticing.)  Given that the book is entitled...  well, you know - &#34;Losing My Virginity: How I Survived, Had Fun, and Made a Fortune Doing.....&#34; I wanted to add my two sense.  He has two beautiful children.  Those children are probably the most beautiful thing about him.  The look makes you feel like you almost know those children, intimately, and his affection and love for his children he unabashadely wears on his sleeve, making him more gorgeous than he already is - inside and out.  The growling though... is very disconcerting, I wonder if anyone else has ever noticed that?
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great movie. I absolutely loved it! I highly recommend watching it. It was a little bit of everything all in one movie. Great couples movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My granddaughters were very impressed with the calculator.  I was too.  It's large buttons and large read display make it e a st for me to see. Will recommend this to any one who has a android system phone or kindle.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|You never get tired of this awesome joyride jetpack game it keeps you playing for hours it's worth my game time love this game
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It already is an indispensable tool if you have Netflix/Hulu but it continues to become more useful and will add more functionality at a impulse buy price.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|My 12 year old niece and her friends have alot of fun with this game and I don't have to worry about the content
B00F91H666|2.0|Zombies, killing, Brad Pitt.  More than two hours of zombies, killing, and Brad Pitt.  I actually like Brad Pitt but this movie is junk.
B00139XTG4|4.0|While not a classic scientific text arguing a thesis and it doesn't look like it it was intended to be one it does make one think about the world, randomness and more.  A worthwhile read.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I love this game.  I am not young ans this really helps keep my mind active.  I have several of the FlipPix Art games and will eventually have them all.  I enjoy them so much that I have uninstalled and re-installed them a couple times to play them over again from scratch.  Seems simple until you get to the larger grids.  A lot of fun too.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|An ageless classic for everyone---it's part of our cultural core. To miss this one is like missing THE WIZARD OF OZ.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Seems like a lot of other games of bouncing a ball or bullet around, but has some unique quarks.  Worked well on my kindle and had a lot of fun playing it,
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I think this should have been ONE movie, not a two-parter.  Greed?  Stupidity?  Can't tell; the Hobbit is just not that long a story and didn't need 4 hours.  This was a gift and I haven't actually watched it - -and won't until the rest of it comes out.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this every day several times.  Keeps me out of the rain and aware of what is happening around me.  Simple and accurate.  easy to use and good visuals.
B001VTTRC6|5.0|Brilliant filmmaking by Clint Eastwood, brilliant storyline, and as for the film quality itself, nice clear picture and no problems watching it.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I love the characters, John Corey, his wife, Kate, Jack Brenner, Zamo, and even Buck. I love the story line which was to capture or kill the master mind behind the bombing of the Cole in Yemen. I found myself laughing out loud at John Corey's humor who DeMille used to tell the story. I loved the way DeMille brought in his star character, Jack Brenner, of such great novels as &#34;The General's Daughter&#34; and &#34; Up Country&#34; to team up with John and Kate in Yemen. I hope to see more of them together. However the story was stretched to it's maximum plus and became boring in the long middle. If it wasn't for my love of the characters, I might have gone to the last chapter prematurely, which I have never done.
B00G6ZTM3Y|1.0|it will not leave the name screen. worst 1.99$ ever. i cant do da turrotle because it not go past thr character screen!! wat do i do??
B002VHI8FE|5.0|best novel i read in at least 10 years ... even though i read &#34;A song of ice and fire&#34; three years ago.<br /><br />If you like novels with deep REASONABLE - not pure happy happy - characters in a well made fantasy world with a slight dose of humor buy this book with no hesitation.<br /><br />The characters and the set simply captivated me. First day i picked it i read it 8 hours straight. Going to buy the second and third books right now.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|A bit confusing, but addictive game after you get used to it! GO through the tutorial. Worth the space it takes up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and great game for all kids but yah there's no bad side to this so you should get it .has lots of levels
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Kids will love this movie!  It is visually interesting and the plot moves quickly.  Movie appeals to kids and adults.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Download this cool fun game everyone should play this game. if you play this game yo won't we disappointed......................<br />.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is incredibly awesome I may be just 14<br />but I know a good game when I see one
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is  a very good game!  What's with the one stars people.  I find the game very creative.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works well and is like my 10 key machine on my desk. Would recommend it to anyone that needs a calculator on the kindle fire.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is a wonderful collection and well worth the money! I watched this collection from start to finish, excellent buy!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a really fun game but it is really annoying to have to wait 30 minutes for my next life. I don't have all day to keep coming back to the game. Also, the game stops at the 35 / 36 level (can't remember exactly) and you either have to pay or beg your friends to unlock the next level. I wish I could just pay $5 or so and have complete access to this game. I'm not paying 99 cents here and 99 cents there. So, I guess I will have to quit the game now that my progress is locked.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun but definitely needs more rooms. will be watching for more.  hope they come up with more soon. thanks for sharing.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I became an Apple lover after reading this. He was a genius ass****. Indispensable for IT people. I'm a programmer, until 2010 I hated Apple and now I'm writing this on an iPad and planning to change my Samsung Galaxy S4 cell phone for and Apple iPhone 5S
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just a warning...it is addictive!! I have enjoyed this game very much.<br />Just wish there was a tutorial as I sometimes don't know what I am doing.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|Love this show - especially on DVD with no commercials - can't wait for the next season to come out
B009PMEEY2|5.0|I LOVE this game!!!  I first purchased it on my Mac computer and I'm thrilled I could buy it for my Kindle at such a reasonable price.<br />It's different from most games, and it has that Oriental flavor that I enjoy.  The colors and the artwork are just beautiful too.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is such an addicting game. This is one game, I do not mind paying actual $$ to get extras
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok this game is the best game I ever played. My 9 year old daughter loves it so much. Also my 8 year old daughter loves it too. Make more of this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It is really challenging and makes me think. You do have to do a couple rooms before you figure it out.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|Bought for my wife, she loves it. Its kind of hard to use this many words to rate an album.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|A masterful storyteller at work.<br />When I reached the final page I was disappointed that there was no more to read. The characters are so intriguing and well drawn that I had to immediately buy the next book in the series to find out what happened.<br /><br />This is set in Sweden. There are two key plots happening simultaneously. A Swedish financial investigative journalist publishes a libellous attack about a powerful industrialist and is fined a huge amount and sentenced to jail. Vanger, an industrialist, hires the journalist to investigate the 36 year old disappearance of his 14 year old grand niece. She is assumed dead. Yet, every year on his birthday, he receives a mysterious gift of a pressed flower, the exact gift his missing grandniece used to give him when she lived there. The journalist uncovers dark secrets about the Vanger family including connections to the Nazis. This story will have you reading into the night to find out what happens.<br />O.N. Stefan The Deadly Caress [...]
B00B7Y0206|1.0|this app is stupid it want even install and I tried to download it a million times it want work its horrible don't get it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a truly beautiful and tragic tale, filled with action and overwhelming emotion. Katniss Everdeen... forever the girl on fire!
1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now is life changing.  For those I have shared this work, a similar experience has been had.<br /><br />I will actually buy many more of this great work.<br /><br />God bless Eckhart Tolle,<br /><br />Paul deMontesquiou, Esq/Broker<br />Charlotte, North Carolina
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great drama. Interesting stories. Gotta love the Dowager. She's like the Groucho Marx of Downton with her rapid one liners.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Waste of time! Glad we got it from the library. It portrayed MT as a woman that no one liked and whose policies were doomed to failure! It made me very angry as the real Thatcher was a woman who stood her ground with her policies against liberalism and stayed confident as everyone else fell into the political correctness BS. This country needs people like her now instead of the wimps we've got! Typical Hollywood bashing of conservatism.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It doesnt work on netflix, just a fill movies, do not worth the price. I dont recomend that device. garbage.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Catan. It's a game of strategy, and luck. You can team up, make alliances, destroy those alliances, biuld your places.<br />Basically, it's the best non-cooperative board game ever.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book started a little slow for me, but by the end I could not put it down. I would recommend it to others.
B0093X805W|5.0|Always a classic.  Just as fun to read to my kid now as it was for me to read as a kid myself.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|What's more interesting than the story is the feeling of being trapped and suffocating under that regime. This book tells it beautifully.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Beautifully filmed, rich and fascinating characters, interesting history woven into the storyline, great atmosphere.  At the end of each episode, I can't wait to see the next.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I enjoy Grisham, his books are informative, interesting and well written. Even though he has become predictable, I still look forward to his new material, whatever the subject, law or sports.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I am always let down when the season ends. I try to limit myself as to how many episodes I watch at a time so it doesn't end too soon. The characters are so well developed and portrayed. I love the eclectic mix of history and fantasy.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|It lost 4min. the first 5 days. Amazon credited my account so all is well , it has an odd size band 16.8 mm hard to replace , need at least an 20mm for any kind of a selection.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Excellent read, both on the adventure and plot side of things and the thought-provoking, intellectual side as well. Charming, well-paced, and something that all ages can get a wonderful read out of. One of a kind.
0805086846|5.0|Everyone should read this book. I have purchased it and given it as a gift several times. History books in school doesn't tell you the whole story.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Loved this movie in the theater, was hardtop find on Blue Ray near me. Jessica Chastain is riveting in this gripping thriller. Keeps you on the edge of your seat even though you know how it has to end.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Lee Child does it again. Another great Reacher story with all sorts of twist and turns. You will love this one from start to finish.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can't put this down, almost done and can't wait to get the next book.  Really good book. Thank you!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. My kid does too.I recommend this app if you have children<br />My kid loves it a lot. It is so entertaining.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|Not quite as good as some of the previous Sigma books, but still a very good read and well written.
B000SW16NU|5.0|The movie does a great job of duplicating the excitment  the Crusades must have engendered. Glad I saw it, but equally glad I didn't have to live in that time.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Gave this Five Stars:  Great story line of how the aristocracy, with all the fancy titles live.  Very interesting even the distinction of the classes, even among the house staff and servants!  Honestly I do not understand about the money, budget, and finance of the Estate...  Maggie Smith, what a Treasure and smart wit, love, love, love..<br /><br />If could, I would give minus stars because I Hated the two commercials that suddenly showed up beginning Season 2 and again at the beginning in Season 3!!  I paid premium price for the Complete Series DVD Blue Ray Disk Set's.  I don't want to see ANY COMMERCIALS!! Nothing against Ralph Lauren and/or Viking River Cruises. BUT, I DO NOT WATCH TV, NOR DO I HAVE CABLE TV FOR THIS VERY REASON!  Saving grace, fast forward button's  ;)<br /><br />Overall LOVE IT,  you can love to hate the class structure.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|If you like playing Mahjong then you will like this game.  It has a lot to offer and a variety of choices to enhance your play time. I definitely recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Katniss, the flawed heroine, never gets any better, and while I enjoyed the twist at the end, there were other things at the end that left me wanting.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I really liked this game.  It has different levels that make it challenging and addictive. For me that was the problem.  I was staying up and not sleeping just trying to beat the level.  Definitely a great game.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|I'm a big fan of this author. While I am more fond of his Stormlight and Mistorn series, this was a good read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive.  I've known people at work who get in trouble because they can't see to quit playing this game.  I have to set a time limit or else I'd never quit.
B002DOSBMK|4.0|I have read the first three books in this series. I like this one the best. The setting and society is intriguing and very different from run of the mill fantasy settings.
B00FI7XBIS|3.0|Granddaughter was switching out games and thought she would try this one.  After 30 minutes she was bored.  She said it just wasn't that much fun.
0552774294|5.0|because it deserves the highest rating.  Gives facts not  fantasies.  Things I began to question as I entered my 30s are answered clearly in this book.  It's a great read.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|This is the first game my three year old grandson was able to play by himself.  It took him a while to learn some of the things like putting the bridge together.  However, he is able to make choices about the type of car and cargo and seems to really enjoy it.  The first thing he says when he comes to visit is, &#34;I want to play trains&#34;. I have tried several but this is the one I recommend to preschool aged kids.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is like potato chips, once you start, you cant quit. the levels are easy to complete in the beginning.  Then progressively get harder.
B008NMT684|3.0|Purchased this because I figured my grandson would like it.  He was okay with it but does't play it that much.  I think he was just tired of the puzzle aspect of games for his age.
B005544TRQ|4.0|This is a really good show. I love the characters and the story. Mike and Rachel are super cute as a team.
B00CHCUR9I|5.0|Nice artwork and layouts. I look forward to continuing the series. TV show follows the first book exactly. Can't wait to see where it differs.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great Great!! Great! My knives are happy!!! Sharpen knives great and is very practical for transporting. I recommend this product
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Smashing game indeed, I would say compare to Temple Run, Subway Surfers, Angry Gran Run, Beat the Boss Run, and more patients of this game. Warning: This game requires internet, if you do not have internet, then do not buy this app
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows.  The writing is top notch with a great blending of humor and drama.  While the quality of the drama can come and go, I will admit a lot of the stuff revolving around river can some times be tough due to Summer Glau's not so amazing acting, the humor always works.  Even Glau pulls off the comedy which really is saying something.<br /><br />Fillion really makes the show.  He was destined to play this character and you can just feel the charisma rolling off the man.  He has that good guy in a not so good world thing going on, and he is as ruthless as he needs to be while still having honor.  Its the kind of personality traits you see in great characters such as the Doctor from Doctor Who.  And he really pulls it off.  He has made me a fan of his for life.<br /><br />The other thing that really helps this show work is the world building.  The entire universe where these characters live feels real.  The level of detail that Whedon has gone to is amazing and unlike some other shows this one feels like it is set in a living, breathing world.  And how can you not love sci-fi western.  Its a great genre that many have been trying to copy since this show came out.  Combine that with really great details, like the mixture of Chinese and English, gives the show a backdrop to play each episode off of is that extra something that really makes this show sing.<br /><br />Also, for sci-fi buffs out there, having a show with no sound in space is a rarity.  It's a small detail and some more casual viewers may be bothered by it, but its a great detail.<br /><br />The only really sad part is how few episodes there are to this.  You can feel he was building to some great stuff that we will never get resolved.  Sure there was the movie, but this only resolved River's story and left so many of the other plot threads swinging loose.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I thought this game was very fun. It has about of minions you can choose from. Although they are expensive.
B003B02O0A|3.0|I realize that this book is well liked and from a successful and famous author and I also read that many consider this his best, but I didn't especially appreciate it. I didn't think the characters were well developed or believable and the story line had little suspense and was almost boring in its predictability. I recently read a real history book, Devil in the Grove about Thurgood Marshall and a real case of injustice dealing with racisim which puts this book to shame. The non -fiction book was full of suspense and there was real involvement with the people involved. Anyway, I guess this will be my first and last Grisham novel
B008XG1X18|5.0|I find so many great things. I ENJOY CRAFTS AND FUNNY NERDY THINGS. MINECRAFT WARRIORS AND FUNNY THINGS. WHAT I AM.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Love love love this album! I got this in two days and was so psyched for it. I don't have any criticism... Can't wait to hear what she's going to put out next!!
0743270754|5.0|Books like this thoroughly engage the reader in history. What I appreciate in Team of Rivals is not only the depth of research, but the personal involvement and the sense of being there in the times. It's a story well told, that looks closely at personalities and how they interact -- like Salmon Chase and his daughter Kate, or the frequency of men having intimate (though not overtly sexual) relationships with other men. Lincoln EVOLVED toward the point of freeing the slaves, and evidently pulled off a miracle in ultimately saving the Union -- often through trade-offs and constantly working with the many who opposed him, often including those in his own Cabinet. Through letters, diaries and other primary sources, Goodwin gives us a sense of the strength, magnanimity and kindness of the man rightly regarded as one of America's greatest Presidents.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game that goes on for seemingly forever since there isn't any actual end to it. Can be played extensively without spending your real cash but you have to have friends playing with you. Can end up costing you a lot of money too so keep it in check!  Essentially a hidden object game but you are searching rooms of an unusual manor. Worth giving a try.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|A good 007 movie. Some interesting plot twists. Fun. I am interested in seeing the next installment. Moneypenny - what a surprise.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is amazing just saying, this love story triangle is crazy and it couldn't get any better than this.
B00GFOIUVQ|1.0|Okay, I followed instructions and downloaded the Amazon Appstore (against my wishes, really...I just REALLY want THIS particular game.)<br />So now I can't find it...only some chibi anime thing called &#34;Thor: Lord of Storms.&#34;<br />???<br />I'll change my rating WHEN I can find and download the app (why can't they just be delivered to my Android like Kindle purchases, eh?)<br />Any and all suggestions gratefully accepted.  Even if it turns out to be obvious, and I feel stupid for not seeing it. :)
B004JK61K0|3.0|This did not work for me.  I don't know why.  Maybe I will try again after I have learned more about my tablet.
B003YTLKTE|5.0|I love love love this movie. It's funny, cheerful, musical, and uplifting. The scene in the piano store is brilliant.
B00EKJWS1Q|3.0|I am using this on my BlackBerry Z10 running 10.2.1.xxxx. The application is fast, but not that user friendly. It could be better, but still does the work. I did not want to add an Outlook account directly to my Z10 because I receive a lot of junk mail on that account. Thus, I use this instead to check it once a day.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|*Spoilers* DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK!!! JUST DONT!!<br /><br />  You know that feeling of despair that you get when the main love interest dies? It's because you imagine yourself as the main character, getting into their mind and sharing their thoughts and feelings, and when they lose them so do you. I thought that was bad. It does not even begin to compare to the loss of the one whom has become an extension of yourself.<br />  You become so attached to the main character of a story; experiencing their trials, hardships, wins, etc. In short, you become them. So when they are no longer there, you feel their loss like a missing piece inside of your heart.<br />  That's how I felt after I read this. I think I lost a part of myself with these characters that I can't quite get back. I still loved the book and could not have been more proud of Tris, but at the same time I can't deny the agony of her loss.<br />  If nothing else, this trilogy has taught many of the greatest lessons of life there are to know and I will carry them each with me, just as Tris did.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Has great grafics and it keeps you entertained. I like this game and hop they upgrade it so it will be better.
B00BFV1JZI|3.0|I love the hunger games series but the last one was pretty disappointing. It started off well enough but went down hill towards the beginning of the war. The characters seemed less interesting and even disconnected with many major plot elements simply rushed or glossed over. It's like the story was written too quickly. A disappointing ending to a great series.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|my game freezes on the 3rd level can't get it to go any further.  I like this game from my computer. but not on the kindle
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is beyond good, it's amazing. Once you start reading, you can't stop. Can't wait to read mockingjay! Yay!
006202406X|1.0|Horrible. This book felt rushed, the storyline wasn't tied up nicely and the ending is pointless and disappointing! The dual viewpoints does not work well, among other things.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Why isn't the Short Fuse levels on here when they SHOULD be?! Come on Amazon you're better than this! My son really wants the new levels.
B003O86FMW|5.0|IT WAS AWESOME. I LOVE IT IS NOT Appropriate FOR ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN FARIES IT IS WONDERFUL. THANKS FOR WRITING THIS
B00CATSONE|5.0|What a great read.  I never knew about Tesla.  Highly recommended for everyone to read and learn.  Three more words
0670024856|5.0|This novel spans the nineteenth century, or the `Age of Enlightenment' and is the story of Alma Whittaker, who was born in Philadelphia to extraordinary parents. Her mother, Beatrix, came from a Dutch family of botanists and her father, Henry was born in England, his father being the King's Apple Magus at Kew. Henry himself had sailed the globe as a young man and had made his fortune by helping the Dutch East India Company to break the Jesuit's monopoly on Cinchona (Quinine).<br /><br />From her mother Alma learned many languages and from her father much about botany and how to grow mosses. She became something of an expert on the latter and had books published on their development, cultivation and categorisation. She marries late and the marriage is a failure, but when her father dies Alma decides to retrace her husband's footsteps to Tahiti and to seek out the truth about the contents of his mysterious valise. This is truly a voyage of discovery which takes her to strange places, not all of which are charted.<br /><br />When Alma arrives back in her mother's hometown of Amsterdam she is reunited with her maternal family. She reads of Darwin's theories of evolution which accord with many of her own ideas and observations. She finds a kindred spirit in Alfred Russell Wallace who has also developed many theories similar to her own but has also never solved the evolutionary explanation for human altruism and self sacrifice.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary novel of an evolving century, encapsulated in the unlikely form of Alma Whittaker. It is, itself, a voyage of discovery rather than arrival, slow moving rather than pacey and perhaps a little on the lengthy side for my personal preferences. However, it is certainly a thought provoking read.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|Got this one after attending a seminar on what is takes to succeed. This book has done a lot for me, especially when it comes to my children and helping them develop the mental attitude and other tools that will achieve their goals in the future, whatever they may be.
1607066017|4.0|Really good start to the series. I want to buy the second volume. Artwork is excellent, fonts are really good for readability.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|The movie had a good story line and was very good but I could of done without the language. It would have been just as funny without the horrible language.
B00BSWMITK|4.0|More great songs from Joe.  He's on fire for this one, more great vocal-ish melodies.  Not much else to say,<br /><br />I was very enthused to hear Vinnie C. was in the drum seat for this one.  He's an amazing force on the drums, though his playing here is actually more restrained than I'd hoped for.  But he more than serves the song and his feel is just amazing.<br /><br />The intro song is massive and just gets you going.  There are a lot of fun songs, some feel pensive, others make you want to drive too fast, some just have beautiful & soaring melodies.<br /><br />But it's all good stuff (even the silly &#34;Three Sheets&#34;) and more than a worthy addition to my CD collection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game. It is very addictive and challenging.  I would recommend this game. Even the kids like playing it.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I have been a big Portnoy and Sheehan fan for years.  I only knew Richie Kotzen from a tune on the &#34;Bill & Ted 2&#34; soundtrack CD (&#34;Dream of a New Day&#34;, great song).  I was wary of buying this even after hearing &#34;Elevate&#34; because I was worried about getting another &#34;chops with no soul&#34; CD, which some of these &#34;supergroups&#34; seem to make.<br /><br />I worried for nothing.  This is just simply a great rock CD, start to finish.  Fun, catchy songs with lots of guts behind the notes.  Billy Sheehan especially shines in trios as this lets his tone come through more clearly.  He gets lost in the mix with keys or more than one guitar, IMO.  Mike Portnoy slams the tunes in just the right amounts, without getting too technical.  And Richie just makes this band.  His voice and his guitar is the perfect fit.<br /><br />My own favorite tune is &#34;I'm No Angel&#34;. &#34;Not Hopeless&#34; and &#34;Six Feet Deeper&#34; are my other faves.<br /><br />The sound production is great, I'd probably have backed down a bit on the master volume levels or compression or something a bit, though.  It feels a tiny bit too &#34;boomy&#34; for my tastes.  But it doesn't keep me from giving this 5 stars.<br /><br />Here's to hoping the 2nd CD kills this one!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is really fun I love the adorable pets  like always there's a catch almost all the pets cost gems do u really think I'll spend money buying gems they ended to fix that problem so watch your wallet .
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this daily to relist my items as they sell. Great to have if you are bidding on an item that ends before you get home. I also like to surf Ebay in bed, and my laptop is just too big.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Good for just fooling around. Good sound and graphics with super great guns all  realistic and relevant to the time period.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its fun but very time comsuming.......... I don't like the invest points<br />I would like it more if It didn't have the invest points
1451624468|5.0|What the other five star raters said. I learned a lot of things I was not aware of, the science of cosmology and physics is moving so fast these days it's easy to fall behind. This book will bring you up to speed, fairly easy to read, although I had to flip back a few times to reread some parts to make sure I was &#34;getting it.&#34; The diagrams helped.<br /><br />Ignore the one star reviews. They sound annoyed that the universe will eventually end, and it doesn't jive with their belief systems.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|this is not another minecraft ripoff. this is really good. it has really cool weapons yoou can find in the various caves and dungeons aroundd the large world. there are tons of bosses and npc. You can build houses for traders to move in or hunt zombies with your guns,swords,magic,and more
B008JFUN6E|2.0|This is a bad movie. The script is cumbersome. The actors look uncomfortable delivering the lines. The politics are ridiculously simplistic. I've read Howard Zinn, Marx, and Noam Chomsky, and they'd all, I think, see this film's politics as almost childishly simplistic.<br /><br />The earth sets look like something from an 80's break dance movie.<br /><br />The Sci-Fi part is barely explored. It's not like Gattaca in any way. Gattaca is ten times more complex and interesting.<br /><br />The director just wants to say rich people are bad. That's pretty much the sum total of his artistic vision. His depiction of the affluent people who reside on Elysium is so caricaturish that it's laughable. It's as if he looked at some photos of a party in the Hamptons he saw on Guest of a Guest and used those as his inspiration.<br /><br />Class war is a complex matter, but here it is addressed in the least complex of ways. Marx's Manifesto is far, far more complex. Go watch The Matrix and some Mike Leigh movies instead of this rubbish.<br /><br />I like Matt Damon, but he should stick to playing characters with a Harvard IQ. They don't have to be rich people. Will Hunting was not. The guy in The Departed was not. Just let his characters be smart. He looks trapped playing characters below his level of intelligence. Same goes for Jake Gyllenhaal and Edward Norton.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This giant just a kids book. My daughter's and I both read it and enjoyed it.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was better than I expected by a long shot, and I had high expectations for this book. I can't wait for the sequel.
B00DL2W7Q4|5.0|The books starts slow but gets better as it goes along . Classic Malcolm Gladwell - thought provoking and interesting!
B008NB0SQO|5.0|This is a must have Christmas movie to have in your holiday collection. It is sure to put a smile on your face. Crystal clear picture, and awesome sound track.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Amazing gameplay. So many great choices on how to wipe out humanity. Very, very weird concept, but a lot of fun is in store for you . Once you get past that realization, anyways..
B00CDJNHH4|5.0|This classic movie made the blu-ray conversion with outstanding results. Picture clarity & the sound track quality are both amazing. I watch all my movies on a 150&#34; HD projection screen, so I really notice picture quality improvements on a screen that big. The picture is quite noticably clearer over the upconverted DVD version. Can't wait for Jaws 2 to be released.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Terraria is a sandbox style game with little a storyline at all. The only possible storylines (you could probably just call them objectives) I've found are:<br />&middot;Find all the Crystal Hearts<br /><br />&middot;Make an NPC town<br /><br />Whether you decide to be a hermit, travel the world forever (at least until you fall off the edges of Terraria), or make the best town EVER, this game is sure to bring supernal joy to any young boy, girl, man, woman, or even grandma; only once she's done making a real farm, as she can make a virtual one. Terraria is a great choice because:<br />&middot;It is the tablet/pocket-edition of the game, not some $7 rip-off you have high expectations for. ie: Minecraft<br /><br />&middot;Tons of terrains, blocks, materials. All of these are in this amazing, rather addictive game.<br /><br />Worth every single dollar. Get it now for only $2 instead of the $5 (I think that's the cost normally, anyways...).<br /><br />Good luck journeying, and sadly you cannot swim in lava - I learned the hard way.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|it says I have to wait over 40 days until I get 1life. wtf is up with that? fix it. its really annoying how I cant play.
B000JFDBXO|3.0|That the director thought &#34;oh gosh, it's the end of a trilogy, so I can do whatever I want with the characters because no one is going to use them again!&#34; speaks very little of the director's care for the genre, theme, or IP.<br /><br />As a stand alone movie, X3 is good; better than a lot of movies in the genre.<br /><br />Then again, given wall to wall A list actors and a fan base that predates his birth, it's hard to see how anyone could screw this particular world up so badly; then again, I've watched &#34;Red Dragon&#34;, the big budget, big star inferior copy of &#34;Manhunter&#34;.<br /><br />That this man directs, apparently successfully, disturbs me greatly.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|A pretty girl. Things get blown up. The good guys win. Overall, a winning combination and a decent movie. Could have used some character development but that's being picky for this type of flick.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|This case holds a lot of barbie dolls and accessories. We have been using it for almost a year and it is holding up very well. We don't use it as a playmate, just as a storage container. But anyone who has stepped on one of Barbie's shoes knows that storage of accessories is important.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Love Daniel Craig, he makes an excellent James Bond!!!  Skyall is an awesome addition to the James Bond series, can't wait to see what they come up with next.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen King is back to his old self.  Now this is why I read him.  Tight plot, ghoulish story and good characters.  Much better than Under the Dome.  Evil characters, &#34;yes,&#34; but not bullies and loons like some of his other books.  And if you believe that the mind has indeterminate capacity, then you will love this book.  Enjoy!
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|I really enjoy the collaboration between Norah and Billie Joe.  These songs were originally recorded by the Everly Brothers in 1958.  Norah and Billie Joe make these songs sound current and fresh.  My favorite song is &#34;Roving Gambler&#34;. This is a great story song about what happens to a man with a gambling problem. The harmonica playing is superb throughout this song.  &#34;Long Time Gone&#34; is probably the prettiest folk song about heart break I have ever heard. Billie and Norah harmonize so well on this song.  The piano playing is so good on this track. &#34;Lightning Express&#34; is another great tune.  It is about a young boy travelling on a train to see his dying mother.  This young passenger does not have the money for train fare.  He is shown compassion by the other passengers when they pay for his train fare.  The words of this song are very moving, and that why I like it.  &#34;Oh So Many Years&#34; is an up tempo folk love song that features Norah Jones playing the electric guitar.  She really shows her versatility as a vocalist and a musician on this track.  &#34;I'm Here To Get My Baby Out Of Jail&#34; is a song about the things that a mother is willing to do to get her son out of jail.  I love the subject matter of this tune.  I would never hear a song on the radio these days with this much emotion. &#34;Barbara Allen&#34; is a song about a woman that a man ignores in a bar.  He tries to make amends for it when he is close to death.  I can really relate to the lyrics of this song. I have treated many women unfairly in my life, and I would like to make it up for it.  Norah and Billie make me believe that Kentucky is a place to be revered for the simple life style. &#34;Kentucky&#34; is a sweet song.  &#34;Put My Little Shoes Away&#34; is a song that tugs at my heart.  This song is about a young boy facing his own mortality.  This is another beautifully written song filled with emotion.  &#34;Foreverly&#34; is simply a superb musical collaboration by two talented musicians.n by two talented musicians.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Really liked this book.  Young adult books seem to have more to say than their adult counterparts.  It gave me a glimpse of what being terminally ill and young feels like.  Something everyone should experience.  A good book for discussion.
B0090SI582|5.0|A entertaining film for people who like comic books films or don't like them. The acting and film is entertaining.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The concept is interesting, but the \\"buggers\\" is a bit outdated even for 1985 to me.  The ending saved it, though, so go for it if you have nothing else to read.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I don't see anything that can be changed. but I know others do so lets try to make to game better
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Horrible story line. Rushed plot-- Disastrous ending to the series. I can't believe Veronica Roth let this book go to the publisher. I can't believe the publisher printed it!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I feel like there was so much more in what was being said. I really wish there was more to the story than what is. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is great for a quick adult fairy tail
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I enjoyed the challenge. I'd pay for this level of game all day long. I don't understand why it is so long between releases. I play on my Kindle Fire HD and the game plays flawlessly. The graphics are beautiful. I want MORE.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Dr.Luther king Jr is died  so you are going to celebrate it for support LOVE from his heart and his toes
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I'm sure it would be good but it wont let me install. WTF?! everytime I try to download it it does that
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|One of my new favorite games. Really fun action packed and enjoyable. One of the on my boxing games I like for my kindle.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This sophomoric attempt at a novel buries fine writing and fine sensible plotting in a morass of cliches. Characters are universally unlikable and even unknowable as the author strains credulity to create a sensational mess some have called literature.
0399159347|5.0|It takes a little while to get the characters under your belt, but then it is intriguing and fun. This is a book that keeps you reading through the day and into the night. Interesting that the real-life scenario has been in the news just this week despite being decades old.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|as a pretty low level player it is nice to just slide the difficulty level to the left and work my way up instead of being always pounded
B00BATG18K|2.0|Repetitive, soap opera, very far fetched, disjointed viewpoints incredible characters and coincidences<br />Most disappointing! Expected so much more from this writer
B00170DEM8|5.0|I love classic black/white movies! The movies are nostalgic of a time when baby boomers were young and the movies were innocent and filled and they us with imagination!
B00E9A656K|5.0|if you don't buy this game you are crazy the graphics are awesome and it is really really fun so you better buy this.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this series! Can't wait to read the next two books to see what happens between Kat niss and peeta!
B00FWLSLJ4|1.0|It's hard to believe that a director like Guillermo del Toro, maker of the wonderful fantasy Pan's Labyrinth, could come up with this horror show.  Godzilla belongs to the 1950s Japanese film makers - cheesy effects but the obtuse creature is somehow warm and fuzzy.  Pacific Rim's mechanical monstrosities singly and collectively have the composite personalty of the cold metal they were made from.  The film has neither social redeeming nor entertainment value.  When it comes to sea monsters, less is more. It's like someone trying produce a film that upstages Jurassic Park with a cast of dinosaurs endowed with superpowers like quantum entanglement and dna encoded cloaking mechanisms. I got so bored with Pacific Rim I couldn't finish watching the thing. Glad I tried to watch it on Amazon streaming rather than wasting time and money at a theater.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|The G13 is awesome.<br /><br />Games I've played with it so far:<br />Battlefield 4<br />League of Legends<br />Guild Wars 2<br /><br />That pretty much encompasses many different game types, and I have no issues using it with any.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy it at full price because 'technically' it's not a 'necessity', but it makes my gaming so much more efficient and comfortable, especially being a person with smaller hands. Keyboards are not all that great for me with gaming.<br /><br />I do have ONE thing that I would make me happier than I already am with the G13... which is a light on the joystick and the two buttons nearby. I sometimes kinda struggle to find the buttons during a panicky moment while I'm playing games with the lights off at 2am.<br /><br />(Oh, and an option to delete the 'Default' profile would be cool)
B005NFVZTM|1.0|I enjoyed the original X-Men movie.  This sequel didn't appeal to me. Too many gimmicks, bad writing, an unoriginal plot I can't even remember, and some unappealing characters.  The ten thumbs of each of several studio execs leave their prints all over this thing. A good movie will transcend any particular age group.  This one doesn't. It seems to target the lowest common denominator of the adolescent demographic. Video games aren't no brainers.  This movie is a brain drainer.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Typical Bond fare. Stunning scenes, women and Putin look-a-like, Danial Craig. Implausible storyline and superfrenetic action scenes. M finally dies. Judy Dench-you had a good run, old girl!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great way to spend your time. Puzzles have great pictures. Keeps you going. Puzzles are not to easy yet not too hard.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Better than the original.  Guns are cooler game play is easier. This has become one of my favorites by far.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|ZILLALICIOUS!!! BRAD PITT TOOK ONE FOR, &#34;THE TEAM&#34; TO KEEP US SAFE WOW!!! HOPE WE NEVER NEED THAT FIX TO SAVE MANKIND!!!  ;D
B00GIZO674|5.0|At first I didn't think I'd like this game but once I started I just couldn't stop.  It's addictive and fun :D try it! You won't regret it!
B0028AQLYE|3.0|I love FINIS products and own many (Zoomers, agility hand paddles, snorkel, cardio cap). I consider myself to have an above average cardio capacity. I swim with the FINIS Cardio Cap 6 days a week (10 Miles) and barely noticed the difference in the load except for the fact that my heart rate monitor displayed an increased BPM of 8-10 beats higher with the Cardio Cap in place. The Cardio Cap states that it &#34;increases conditioning and workload to the lungs by 40%&#34;. I bought this FINIS Swimmer's Dry Top so I could lower my lap times by making flip turns while keeping the snorkel dry. For that purpose it works well. HOWEVER...the level of air restriction mentioned in the product description is, in my opinion, GROSSLY understated. More emphasis needs to be placed on exactly how restricted the air flow actually is. This Dry Top attachment has to restrict airflow by at least 80%. I found it very difficult to draw air through the tube once this Dry Top attachment is in place. I was actually getting lightheaded after swimming 6 laps. I had to remove it from the snorkel after 10 laps.<br /><br />This product would merit a 4-5 star rating if FINIS can find a way to increase the airflow while still keeping the snorkel dry. Otherwise this product will be too restrictive for the average user to take advantage of.
B00742GBDM|4.0|Not quite as good as Gwyneth's Emma but still very enjoyable!  A little predictable but all ends as it should.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Amazing teaching tool for future social work students!  This film helped raise awareness of marginalized populations and government attempts to eliminate culture.
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|My grandfather, Karl Davis, a musician on the WLS National Barndance in the 1930's wrote two of the songs on this CD.  'I'm Here To Get My Baby Out Of Jail' and 'Kentucky'.  Billy Joe Armstrong and Norah Jones do wonderful versions of these songs and all of the songs on this CD!  No fancy production, just pure, clean instrumentation and beautiful vocal harmonies. Thanks Billy Joe and Norah for bringing this great and classic music back to life!
1936891026|4.0|Some areas of the book repeated subject matter, but all and all a funny and entertaining approach to life in general and our ability to handle it.
0060723513|5.0|A story well told. Deliveres a truthful and very spiriltual picture of how this tribe &#34;Down Under&#34; lives their lives. I am pleased that Marlo morgan decided to keep the identity of this tribe confidential thus allowing them to keep sacred their privacy. Thank you Marlo Morgan.
0300169787|5.0|Impeccable. Nobody in the world was or is like Alexander McQueen. Beautiful book. The hint of insight into his process is the most exciting information to have and the photos are stunning.

0345529057|5.0|i bought it because someone made me.. She is not reading it yet.  The HBO series is great.  Hopefully the books are better.

B0040I09RM|5.0|We were so bummed out -we have an antenna only-so couldn't get the show! After I bought my kindle-we received  free trial for Amazon Prime-so we bought a Roku  and now can enjoy the show-my husband loves it-he's an old school biker and doesn't sit still very long to watch a show or movie,but this and other biker entertainment has him hooked! Also I've been checking around and I find that Amazon Prime is the one I am sticking with--great value-great yearly price!! I just wish I could pay the yearly fee with my Amazon gift cards-hopefully that will change-because you could always save enough points in a year to pay your yearly fee-I found out the hard way!! Please-Amazon-change your rules-it would be greatly appreciated!!!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Cute movie to watch (I love musicals).  I could have done without the vomiting scenes, but everything else was very enjoyable.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|shut up Yoda.<br />I really think everyone who likes racing or games should really install this racing game!<br />I play this game on my kindle and the graphics are simply beautiful! This game is NOT a waste of time!
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I enjoy the game and it does have a lot of different things that you can do, but I was quickly stuck because of needing cash and crowns.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I used it for looking up informational stuff in the dictionary \\"_\\" and I love $_$ ^_^ ·_· °_° ¥_¥ I'm sad that I'm done we with it
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|While I have viewed videos before and the trailer does play, even so you library player won't let me play it.  It says that your player needs a flash player thing.  So glad I paid for something I can't watch.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|This game is easy to play. It also takes less time to play than with the actual cards. Love the fact that I can play all by myself. Cause I don't really have any friends that play Magic. Although I wish I could have a two colored deck.
B008XG1X18|4.0|If you enjoy spending hours looking at just about everything you can think of, then this deserves a five Star because I know several friends that get a lot of useful information, especially in the recipe department.....but my main area of enjoyment is reading and second in line is playing Scrabble.  I do know if I need to find a recipe or how to make something, this is the first place I would look!  Would have used this site more when I was younger!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Best game ever this game is so good you get to still cars, shoot people ,go to the club and more
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really enjoyed this story from beginning to end. Salander is a deep and complicated character. My favorite!! Enjoy this read.
B000SW2F80|5.0|/Good old fashion comedy horor.New movies try hard to target a certain crowd.this movie targets all people nation wide. Watch it
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Best Alice In Chains album in a while, and not only a great album but the vinyls looks AMAZING!! BUY IT FOLKS!!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Great little headset, but since it only lasts six months or so, not worth the price they are now charging
B00061QJZI|2.0|The movie appeared to be in good shape, but the dang thing wouldn't play the entire movie! Played about half and then froze up!:/
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is a great movie and the way I expected things to be when Christ was charged and eventually crucified.  This movie is not for children under at least 12 years of age in my opinion because of the brutally.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game, it is not one of those games where they get you into it and then make you pay to move to the next level. And the graphics are very good. Love this game :)
B00DQAM5LI|2.0|I just can't get into this album. I wish I had waited to read some of the reviews first. I won't make that mistake again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|played on my computer and loved it when it finally came to kindle i was ecstatic this game is the best!
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Fabulous music that takes me back to the 60s & 70s.  I had never heard of this small recording studio in Alabama.  What a story!!!
B00GH4R95C|5.0|I think we finally found someone who can step into Chris Reeves shoes. This guy is Superman!  Good movie everyone was believable effects were nice just felt like a Superman movie.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|If you say you love music, then you must watch this film. Had to watch it twice as I cried through the whole thing(probably mourning the loss of good music). Percy Sledge rocks!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent. Another hit for Grisham like always. Can't wait for his next. Always a fan and never disappointed. he hits the mark again.
B0044ZQ8QC|5.0|Nice collection of the works of a classic Italian baroque composer.  If you don't own any recordings of Corelli's music...get some.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|A very cool way to package such an amazing series. Any Breaking Bad fan would be lucky to have this. The barrel is a quality disc case, and will be awesome as a storage container.
1781161313|5.0|A great Book, Given as a gift and well enjoyed. Pictures are good and well printed pages. Seems to be well bound
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game works like farmville. You have a lot of actions to do and you have to know how to read in order to play. I bought it for my five year old and she put it down after 5 minutes. very frustrating.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I'm a huge Tesla fan.  I'm still confused as to how under-appreciated he still is, although he at least has some name recognition now.  He's a bit of a nut job, but Tesla has contributed more to modern society than any other person I can think of.  This is a great book with lots of good information on Tesla
0307712508|5.0|The book is a great chronicle of a phenomenal woman's life, and heroic death. This is a story that warrants more promotion than it's received. The story of Henrietta Lacks should be trumpeted.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm not exactly sure why, but my kids absolutely love this game.  They have the Xbox version as well and can play either one endlessly.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great graphics but slow to earn coins.  Also need to speed up quest accomplishments.  Otherwise fun to play and will recommend to friends
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|The graphics are good.  The game . is fun.  However, without crowns or enough storage space it is hard to get far in the game.  If you don't mind spending real money for a virtual item then you can go far.  Otherwise, it is annoying.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Nice if you like games that involves pet care and vet work. So I recommend this game to everyone. Must get
630529142X|5.0|Adam Sandler plays the waterboy for a bigtime college team.  His naïve, foolish behavior causes his coach and some of his players to tease and ridicule him.  When his coach fires him, he finds a waterboy job with a losing, smalltime team.  His new coach (Henry Winkler) notices the same behavior and tries to work with him.  At one point, the waterboy gets riled up and puts a spectacular tackle on a player of his own team.  His new coach's eyes light up and he puts the waterboy on his team as a player.  The result is spectacular, the team stars winning, the waterboy learns about wild acclaim from fans, he wins an attractive girlfriend (Fairuza Balk) and his formerly overprotective mother (Kathy Bates) realizes she is the cause of the waterboy's naïve and foolish behavior.
B002ZOF61M|1.0|This film is in Korean. I do not speak Korean. I wish I did, but I don't. I am sad.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Bag It is excellent time waster with some great replay value. This is intregal, as in order to progress without paying for additional levels, you must replay previous levels to perfection to unlock higher levels and other game segments. I love Bag It!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Easy to use -- wonderful to keep things from building up -- keeps the Kindle free of un-needed apps and files.
8866137626|5.0|haven't used the upgrade on evernote yet but look forward to it.  i can see how it will work but i'm just not sure i would utilize this to its fullest potential.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Eminem is an amazing artist. The things he does with words and phrases has me listening to this cd over and over again to pick up on everything he throws in there. He mixes all different types of music and really makes his message clear. You can tell how he has grown as a person and an artist in each of his cd's.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|It's ok<br />Could be alittle more difficult.copy cat game. Lacks pizzazz.sucks that I have to have a description word count for me to tell you that the game is&quot;just&quot; ok.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Great story...heart warming. Some scenes may be too graphic for some. Made the mistake of watching movie before dinner. Don't !
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Wish I could give it zero stars! Horrible ending! Ruined the entire trilogy for me! Would not recommend it. Not a good way to start your writing career!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I liked it.<br />it was good.<br />I like pencils.<br />it was good.<br />8 more words required, how about them apples?
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|The quests are close enough together to keep me interested, but far enough apart to avoid my becoming overwhelmed and irritated.  The app doesn't bug me to purchase something every time I open it either.  I can just play for a while.  I live the game.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book left me raging at one moment, crying the next and smiling at another moment. Wish there were more hunger game books after this one!!
B00B1RB942|5.0|After reading the comments posted here on Amazon, I decided to give Summer Wars a try. Although I wouldn't consider myself as part of the hardcore anime crowd, I used to belong to an anime club in high school (back in the early 00s) and have casually remained a fan of anime since then. Summer Wars is an anime which is surprisingly beautiful. I am glad that it retained actual human traits (drawing/artwork) and wasn't all CGI/special effects. Another reviewer likened Summer Wars to some of the works of Miyazaki; if you are a fan of Miyazaki or his works, you will definitely like Summer Wars. Overall, I recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for something new and refreshing, but doesn't want something too far off from the feel of traditional anime.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Made Krypton look stupid!<br />Superman is not just super smart. He is super everything, including super smart.<br />Who green-lighted this project without understanding that concept?
B00GFRA9AS|5.0|This is a beautiful and peaceful game that is alot of fun, and very addicting which is a good thing, I rate it five stars and I look forward to the next version!
B000A7DVR2|3.0|Everybody loves this movie, but I for sure didn't.  I don't know, but it just didn't work for me -- humor seemed forced and the characters grossly overdone, Goodman in particular, whom I've liked in other roles, seemed to be overacting to an embarrassing degree.
039916409X|5.0|Margaret M.Lynch is truly a brilliant master, healer and leader in the EFT/Energy Psychology field, and her new book Tapping Into Wealth is a complete work of art.  If you have not had the amazing opportunity to experience Margaret's new book yet, and if you or someone you know are looking for more abundance, wealth and prosperity in your life spiritually...emotionally...and physically...(literally on any level!) than I highly recommend that you read this invaluable book. Margaret Lynch's brilliant teaching, writing  and tapping style creates a very empowering, transformational ~state of the art~ easy to read step by step program chapter by chapter that has literally has changed my life that virtually overnight shattered all my limiting belief systems and programing that were attached to my money blocks. If you want to shine bigger and brighter in your life.... if you want to own your brilliance...and get paid for doing what you love to do, than this book is for you!
B000JQV68A|5.0|I loved this early work of F. Scott.  The characters are fully developed and one feels he knows them by the end.  The downward spiral of the main character, which recurs in, 'Tender is the Night,' is well drawn and very moving, in some ways more so than in the more famous later book, seems to me.  Some have commented that, 'The Beautiful and the Damned,' is not as good as, 'The Great Gatsby,' which, of course, could be said about almost any book by almost any author one might choose to name.  I thought it was wonderful and truly amazing, given how young he was when he wrote it.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|You move up in levels only if you get the colors you need.  Stuck on level 30 for over 150 turns. Don't waste your precious time with this game like I did. Deleted the game and will never play again!!!!!!!
B00DQC2FPM|1.0|What a shame.  The original competition-winning build (meaning actual legos were used) looked so much better than this over-priced blocky piece of junk.  This is a $15 set at best, not a $35 one.  Do a google image search for Lego DeLorean and check out the ones without those weird windshield frame pieces sticking up.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a great game and all the people who are saying that it is a bad game JUST because it doesn't work with the kindle fire 1st gen. That is a horrible reason to hate it. Yes, some of the later levels do sometimes need the coins for better guns, but you can earn them by ranking up. There is never a reason to buy coins, you just need to rank your character up. BTW, works fine for kindle fire HD
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|So addicting and fun but it doesn't sync with my phone so I have to beat the levels again. It doesn't always seems life's when I am asked.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I am enjoying this series of books and and have read next in line. I cannot wait until the following books are released.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|You need to put books in it.  This is the state of the Kindle Library.  Tons of free resources to help anyone become a published author.  GONE are the days of three months on the prospective publishers list before being accepted or rejected.<br /><br />The old way process of publishing print material in hard cover, I believe will always have its place.  It's too valuable to the future of the industry... but often, people just want to go through the process, &#34;stick their big toe in the water&#34; and check the temperature.<br /><br />The Kindle Library is perfect for all types of authors and &#34;Building Your Book for Kindle&#34; is an excellent guide produced by the people who brought us Kindle.  This book will introduce you to the facts and realities of publishing in a way that is easy to understand while providing useful information to begin your Kindle Publishing project.  With this resource... go for it!
0061950726|5.0|A very touching story. I understand that this really did happen. Two people, one old and one young, find common ground.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love my Chromecast. I used to always watch TV streaming on my 13&#34; laptop because plugging in the HDMI cable was a bit of a hassle. Also, I couldn't use my laptop for anything else while the show I was watching was playing. I think my favorite feature with the Chromecast is that if I cast a tab that I'm viewing (say hulu), I can still switch tabs or do something else and the tab I cast continues to show on my TV without interruption. I've noticed that if I cast a chrome tab it may sometimes lag a bit, but if I just pause and go again it usually fixes itself. If I stream netflix directly from my account with my phone it runs flawlessly however.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|its fun and cool good killing and great action really like this game a lot good for when you have nothing to do
0399255370|4.0|I read this book to my 4 years old boy; he really loves this story book.  I gave four stars because I realized the book cover was torn after I opened the shipping box! I bought a brand new book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun for the whole family....and very addictive..once u start u can't lay it down...I love it a lot...Everyone I know has joined since I started playing.....
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This is a visceral film that hits you, like a sledgehammer, in the guts from the beginning. Like an earlier, yet lesser film, made in the same genre with Val Kilmer and Mike Douglas, &#34;The Ghost and the Darkness&#34;, it has an incredible problem out of the gate, in that you respect the Wolves and also their valiant attempt to protect their rightful habitat, but you don't want these characters to be killed by them. Nevertheless, This film is a real grabber: There is a plane crash, at the beginning, of the most terrific and horrible magnitude, (please stand back, &#34;Flight of the Phoenix&#34;). Then, there is only the dreadful cold, unrelenting, with the chase of the Wolves intent to kill every survivor of the crash. Liam Neeson, as he says early in the film is &#34;cursed by the Damned&#34;. He is being pursued by the very animal that he has been paid, by a huge oil company, to kill as protector of the oil drillers, so irony abounds. He, really, is at his best here, and I believe given the flash-backs of his &#34;film-wife&#34;, this must have been a very poignant and moving experience for him, personally, and I think that is reflected in his intense acting skills, so exhibited. This is a gritty, semi-epic, that deserves respect for it's terrific sense of Tragedy in a Wilderness, where mankind is totally abstracted from it's element. Very like a London or Hemingway novel, it spares no mercy for the plight of Man in the Wilderness, with only fire, and their fists to fight off the inevitable prey. Excellent, all the way through.
0061950726|5.0|Wonderful book. You won't be able to put it down. Poignant, touching, connecting generations. My daughter loved it too.<br />Not just fluff. There is historical validity and an understanding of human psychology.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Funny movie very entertaining.  Exactly what we expected. Good rental well worth it.  Met my expectations fully recommend to anyone who enjoys comedies.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|*Galaxy Quest* is a hands-down, thumbs-up classic!!!  This film is a must-see for every sci-fi fan, especially Trekkies!!  Great special effects and aliens, adventure, drama, romance, and a ton of laughs--not to mention Tim Allen at his best and Sigourney Weaver in her most gorgeous role.  Top-notch script, and dynamite performances all the way around.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|3.75 stars<br /><br />I really loved the first book in this trilogy and enjoyed the second book. I liked where the second book left off and obviously I was excited to see how it all ended. There’s obviously been quite a bit of controversy about the ending, and as I said no spoilers, but I will say that I was surprised and wouldn’t use the word “like” but I respected the ending. I also know that this book took a while to come together and was a bit of a disaster for a while and honestly, I totally got that while reading, but I was also influenced by that going in.<br /><br />But let’s skip back a little. When the story starts Tris is imprisoned by the new government, run by Four’s mother, waiting to figure out if she can go free or not. Eventually she’s obviously freed and even though the factions have been abolished there are still a lot of problems. A group called the Allegiant forms whose aim is to bring back the old faction system and also explore what Edith Prior meant when she said they needed to leave the city and help repopulate society. The Allegiant recruits Tris, even though she’s not sure what she wants, and a group, including Tori, Four, Christina, Uriah, and Peter leave the city to go in search of what else is out there.<br /><br />I actually really liked what they found when they left city boundaries, although I thought it could have been developed a little more, I was left with some questions at the end. But I thought the explanation of how the factions and their world came to be was really interesting and, as disturbing as the whole thing was, I really did believe it could (mostly) be true. Which is what I think makes dystopian books either good or bad–you have to be able to buy into what you’re reading as possibly being able to be true.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the book was the length. It was just so long, but somehow felt like not much happened. Even know when I’m writing this review, I’m trying to recall what happened and pretty much I have Tris released, they leave the city, discover what’s in the world, try to figure out what they want to do next. The story never dragged, but I still think it could have been made considerably shorter and tightened up, as well.<br /><br />Bottom Line: This wasn’t a completely satisfying finish to the story for me. I wish Veronica Roth could have ended it as well as she started it, but I didn’t dislike it and part of me respects that she was able to do what she did. I’m glad I read the series and I am incredibly excited for the first movie next year!ed and pretty much I have Tris released, they leave the city, discover what’s in the world, try to figure out what they want to do next.

B003NFM3JK|4.0|We enjoyed this one last year on pay per view and wanted to add it to our DVD collection.  On a flat screen, all the visual tricks used to enhance a 3D experience seem a bit contrived, but like the effects in The Polar Express, the story still takes center stage.  In some ways, Robert Zemeckis misses the point of this Christmas story and in an effort to make this film an \\"experience\\" for 3D theater viewers, especially children, he sacrifices story and character for cheap amusement park thrill ride.  In A Christmas Carol, the story still comes through and many elements of the original story appear that are often not included in other film versions of this story.  Unlike the Polar Express, the music in this film is nowhere near as memorable.
B00BLCHZC2|2.0|Only 1 season, it's left hanging wide open at the end.  Anyway, not the greatest series, but I suppose some of the historical reference is interesting.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love the way Nicholas Sparks writes.  Another winning book.  Is there a movie about this one in our future?
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I saw my friend's playing this on their I phone and I had to look it up I think this game is extremely addictive and time consuming in a good way. The only downside is you have to wait for you're energy to recharge.
B00985E3UG|4.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but I can say that the introduction is thrilling and I am really looking forward to continuing this book. I wanted to provide some feedback quickly and I plan to provide more feedback as I get it finished!
B008OOYALE|4.0|Good game ... not great. I don't think it's great cause I can't even get the game to restart instead of going back to my game that I played but deleted.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey a family favorite, always great, still love the characters, miking the most out of every tiny plot line.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Good game to have. I'm always checking it daily.  Lots of animals to get and lots of goals to complete.
B008MM9630|4.0|needs more notifications about growing and or wilting plants and needs more clarifying instructions to guide you through the beginning overall fun game :)

B00F031X62|5.0|Was this concert filmed and will it later be released on DVD.<br />This would be great, and anything released by Jimi is almost phenominal.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|FUN but def needs more levels to advance too. Otherwise this game was lots of fun to play with my daughter.
B00G5G7K7O|4.0|There is no hope for any other animation studio to overtake Disney as the king of animated cinema. Despite the fact that I've noticed that most of their movies in recent years are more carefully orchestrated than challenging cinema, they have the secret potion. &#34;Frozen&#34; is without question carefully orchestrated to appeal to a wide variety of youths and adults. While the delivery is magical, beautiful and heart-warming is it also easy on the brain and predictable as they come.<br /><br />&#34;Frozen&#34;, based loosely on the Hans Christian Anderson tale, &#34;The Snow Queen&#34;, is as a whole catered toward a certain audience; preteen and above girls. There's princess', romance, singing and dancing and if the entire movie were that way, the boy Disney fans would be squirming in their seats. Disney would never make that mistake though, would they? Absolutely not. Insert a naïve little fun-loving snowman named Olaf and a giant frightening snow beast and &#34;Frozen&#34; is no longer just for little girls. It's for everybody who has a heart and wants to enjoy a world where people are sickeningly kind and good-willed for a couple of hours. Well, except for a couple, but you wouldn't have a Disney movie if it weren't for a couple of bad seeds.<br /><br />That being said, &#34;Frozen&#34; may be orchestrated and predictable, but it is also one of the finest visual treats Disney has produced in years. In fact, I will go as far as to predict that it will become, at some point or another, a classic that is viewed by millions every winter. Olaf the snowman may just go down as one of the best sidekicks to a leading character since Hermey from &#34;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&#34;.<br /><br />It's a shame that more people in the world aren't as simplistic, genuine and naïve as Olaf and Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell). That is the true source of Disney's magic and it is so very simple. We live in a world where we lose our innocence and simplicity way too soon in life. Disney paints a world that we've all forgotten and the kids can relate to. In the movie, Anna falls in love with a prince from Weselton in one-day and wants to be married because she's lonely. While the movie paints this as way too fast and questions what love is, we, in a matter of minutes fall in love with the characters on screen.<br /><br />We've forgotten what it's like to be trusting and openly joyous. &#34;Frozen&#34; explores love and kindness like only the movie studio that built the happiest place on earth can; heavy on the cheese, heavy on the cuteness, heavy on the goofiness, a princess, incredibly visuals, equally incredible sound and beautiful singing from Kristen Bell and Wicked star Idina Menzel. &#34;Frozen&#34; is a Disney classic in the making.<br /><br />This is a 5-star movie that isn't quite as good as the 6-star movie &#34;Tangled&#34;... and it's a 4-star bluray release because THIS version is less of a product than Disney was capable of delivering.  The 3D version of the movie was only released in the UK and I have this 3D version. It is beautiful. I had to have it shipped OVERSEAS to enjoy it. Obviously, Disney has this product available, but American's don't deserve it, or are prime for scalping down the road. Also, what would have been a remarkable behind the scenes movie with Kristen Bell, Olaf and Idina Menzel, is explored in a 'pfft' little video that accomplishes nothing. Shame on Disney for capitalizing with such cheap tactics when they made over 40 billion in profits in 2013.... despite paying a ridiculous sum for Star Wars rights.e.

B000QXDCQ0|1.0|I ordered this a few months ago and didn't have time to open it until tonight. Inside the Entrapment movie case was The Legend of Zorro! The movie was still in the shrink wrap so it had not been opened previously, and now it's too late to return it. What a waste, especially since I already own the other movie.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I hate the normal camera bags that come with cameras, particularly dslrs. They are bulky and just annoying. I love the backpack as it is very convenient. Only downfall is having to lay it down to take out the camera and change lenses etc, but thats probably better since it reduces the chance of dropping from a greater distance! Lots of storage. Holds everything needed and then some.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Great book. However I am always frustrated when they reference previous missions/books and I either haven't read them or can't remember.
0670033693|5.0|This is the first book in the Walt Longmire series. Definitely a great series!! I picked up my first Longmire book about three years ago. I went back and started from the beginning...this book! I love Craig Johnson's books !!

B00A25NLOU|3.0|A quirky little tome about books and the secrets they hide, the onslaught of technology and information fatigue, featuring a (codified) typeface, Gerritszoon, that potentially holds the key to immortality, Google code-breakers with big white boxes, and a quaint little vertical 24-hour bookstore with shelves that disappear into the darkness above, tucked inconspicuously next to a shady nightspot down a small street.<br /><br />Our hero, Clay Jannon, is a recently disenfranchised web designer for an upmarket bagel company, who stumbles into Penumbra's store by providence/accident, and finds himself embroiled in increasingly weird situations as a nightshift store clerk, encountering a motley crew of afterhours customers who come not to buy but borrow some ancient tome or other from the &#34;Wayback List&#34;, in the recesses of the already minuscule shop, &#34;with algorithmic regularity&#34;.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, Jannon, and his Silicon Valley friends, find themselves on a quest to decipher a text, or the codex vitae of the founder of a 500-year-old bibliophile cult, called the &#34;Unbroken Spine&#34;. This codex vitae is a document in code that contains what he learned in his life, which is held in a subterranean library in New York. And that's where the story goes the way of a Harry-Potterish YA novel, complete with black-robed cult members, led by Penumbra's old friend-turned-nemesis, the First Reader, Corvina, whose wrath descends on Penumbra when he finds out he's violated one old cult rule too many (no spoilers here).<br /><br />For the most part, this is an absorbing novel, with enough twists and hit-you-square-in-the-face contemporary references to keep the reader's interest. It's quite clear that the Sloan is a fanboy of the fantasy genre, as he makes Jannon voice these thoughts in a rather metafictive way, even as he gets ready his forces on the code-breaking quest: &#34;Why does the typical adventuring group consist of a wizard, a warrior, anda rogue, anyway?&#34; However, in a way, because the story is big on plot, the characters seem flat and stereotypical, as the quote above already preps the reader for, and the denouement scenes are just a tad too staged. Nonetheless, it does throw up some interesting perspectives on the way technology changes the way we read and decipher information, and what a book represents.<br /><br />And just for the record, I read this on a Kindle.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|This movie was sinfully fun. I really bought it just to check out the 3D which was excellent as other reviewers indicated. The saber tooth kitten, the warthog dog (I guess), Cloris  Leachman as the annoying mother-in-law-granny, Nicolas Cage as Grug, Emma Stone as Eep - all-star cast, you can read the credits-actors chosen had great chemistry. Pick it up. Amazon had the best price. Great fun for the whole family!
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|It's corny, but i confess it is one of my favorite movies. I watch it whenever I see it on TV, and couldn't resist watching it again on Amazon prime
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game! I love that I don't feel the need to spend actual money. Feels good when you're broke to have a game that isn't trying to rip you off like the others.
B009IJJ712|1.0|How did I get stuck with this as a download when I was trying to get it as a DVD?  There is no cancel button.
B00FP1NNJY|5.0|One of those songs that's beyond catchy. great party mover when im DJ ing can't help but  sing the chorus
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I'd never experienced a game like this before<br />I really like the new trailer for mc5 but this is really good
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved the book and the way it ended, however it took a long time to get there. For the content of a follow up to Time to Kill, it was great. It had a lot of chapters dedicated to each person in the family that went on a little long. Would recommend it for sure...The entire time i was reading it, i had visions of the cast from the movie A Time to Kill.. it made the visual so much fun.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great game and  even after you beat it it still amazes me how fun it is but I don't like the energy core crap
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Keeps you wanting to play longer.  So far this game has been very compelling.  I wish that you could have more crowns when you get into the game.

B0001WGDX0|5.0|While I am not a college professor, classical musician or dedicated critic of &#34;highbrow&#34; pursuits,I have always enjoyed the almost exaggerated expression the late Leonard Bernstein conducted with his Beethoven symphonies. Some conductors seemingly just ran through all of the nine. Others slowed them waaayyyy down.  Berstein ,fo me , is the superior interpretation of Beethoven!
B00821OX98|5.0|good characters for sci-fi.  Reminds me of starcraft a bit.  i watch walking dead too.  both make for a nice past-time.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|A long time die hard Die Hard fan, I rented this on my IPad.  Despite numerous buffering 'time outs' I did enjoy the movie.  Certainly not as good as Die Hard 1 or 2, but all in all a good use of a hundred minutes or so.  Bruce is Bruce and this time the action centers around his son.
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|I paid over 200 dollars for this set and It didn't even have all the contents inside. I guess having all the contents included in an expensive set is asking too much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My wife told me this was a great book and I waited a long time to read it.  But when I stared it was one of those rare books you just can't put down.  I loved it,
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have just started and am not disappointed. It has glitched a couple times, but nothing too serious. I will update after a while. So far, so good.
B00GIZO674|5.0|love it.  great music.  A bit hard to play on smaller screen if you have fat fingers.  Have been playing it all day
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I was 13 when I first read this book, and I have lost count of how many times I have read it since.  Romance, mystery, horror, suspense, it is difficult to put down.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The game is very good i like playing and there are different versions of the characters plus they make the superman and renegade superman are the most expensive finally SOME ONE recognized that superman is the king of DC nation

1451666179|5.0|I love Allie's blog, so I've been eagerly awaiting this book for awhile.<br /><br />Then I forgot that it was coming out. It came out. I saw it in the window. I meant to stop in, and then I didn't. Then I forgot again. Then I had trouble motivating myself to leave my house after I already acted (vaguely) like an adult for a while seven or eight hours.<br /><br />By the time I remembered and stopped in to buy it as consolation for missing my bus, which I knew would make me late to my appointment, she had already had an event at a local bookstore and was gone, along with all the signed copies of her book.<br /><br />I felt very sad.<br /><br />Then I read the book and felt vaguely vindicated, because she describes some similar things happening to her. But I still feel a little sad.<br /><br />The end.<br /><br />Except now I'm going to order another copy. Or two. I'm not sure who's getting them for Christmas, but someone will, because this is a really amazing book.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|There is a lot of sex in this book, but it is not erotic, and the author failed if  that is what he meant to convey. This character Grey is unbelievably crazy, and unbelievably the female character bought into it.  I wonder who is the craziest.  Or have I just led a sheltered life?
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great show!  I am hooked, and cannot wait to see what happens between Alicia and Will.  Am going to start season 2 now.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|enjoyed the story line and puzzles.  most of all had no glitches on my kindle fire which says a lot for some of the apps that have come out recently...enjoy....
B003V9OCS8|5.0|I had been wanting to watch this movie for sometime and could not find it anywhere except Amazon.<br />I am giving it five stars in spite of the fact that it has English subtitles...<br />I was not aware of this when I purchased the DVD. But it was well worth watching and having to pay extra attention to watch the content and read the subtitles. I will watch it again for sure.<br />These men....and the one woman....WOW!<br />Watch it for yourself.
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|The game has good graphics any cool ideas but it's really hard 2 fight. When u fight a boss monster it gets harder to hit and what u do miss it takes along  time before u can hit again. Over all it  an ok game.

0545586178|5.0|The first time I read it, I didn't quite understand everything. Everything was jumbled in my head. I didn't pay attention to the important details, I guess. And there's a movie. Right after watching the movie, I reread it. Everything that confused me was now clear. Everything that I didn't understand was now a solution. It was just amazing! This book is the perfect sequel to The Hunger Games, too! New characters and new settings. Plus, more suspense to it. Every chapter's ending is always so suspenseful at the ending. This book is great, and the ending is a cliff hanger! I was really excited that I had a hard cover copy of it and I would read it over and over and over again!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|bought this game for kindle fire after playing on my ipod. fun game but too similar to bejeweled hence 4 stars not 5.
B003O86FMW|5.0|the second book was so intense!! I love it! all the action and drama wow I couldn't put it down!
B005EHNMWM|5.0|Everything from YHF deserves 5 stars.....there is an honest purity in these songs redolent of Neil Young....simple but profound. The band may have an occasional tendency to go off into a distortion jam that might seem to be a wee bit too extended....but hey...nothing is perfect for all tastes. Five straight five star efforts...not too shabby.
B000NMW6J8|4.0|1999R: This pseudo crime drama turned psychological thriller would've been even better if they had just paced it a little more consistently. Took far too long to let us know if the neighbors were terrorists or not. Good twist at the end. Solid 4x Enjoy MFJLabs 4x.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Super...can't wait to see movie! Lots of twists and turns. A book for all ages. A definite must read for all ages.
B00GNL251C|4.0|2013PG13: I liked it, but I'm a big matrix-effect fan, so ... Decent story line (true or not), and interesting Kung-Fu factoids. Simply EXCELLENT matrix-like fight scenes with the BEAUTIFULLY-FREAKIN-AWESOME Zhang Ziyi. Can't wait to see her work with John Woo in The Crossing (2014).
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|With the 50th anniversary of the murder of JFK, this film does not get lost in time. It is as relevant today as ever. While  you may not be a conspiracy buff, the fact is that in a recent poll almost 3/4 of all Americans believe that Oswald did not act alone in the killing of  President John Kennedy. This is a dramatization of course, but it is closely linked to the real case and reflects the kind of research, legal and political, that has been driven by this case. Costner is outstanding as Jim Garrison; great acting all around. If you remember where you were on that Friday, November 22, 1963 or you want to know what happened to our country and our president on that day, this is a must see.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|ordered this one because a previous brand when got home would not work without leaving it plugged in and the cord on previous one was too short.  sorry for the mix up on the two controllers.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|I'm sorry, I'm not a George Clooney fan, at least not in this film. The best part for me is him running down the street in his bare feet....yep, that was the high point. His family (in the movie) is depressing but it all works out in the end. Not complicated, just a little dry.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|I don’t think I’ve seen a movie divide audiences like Man Of Steel in a loooooong time. Where should a review about this movie begin? I don’t know. I don’t really feel like typing a novel.<br /><br />As you can see, I gave this movie three stars. I really wanted to give it two, but after watching it again, my mind was forced slightly in its favor. This movie is LOADED with problems. I’m not even going to attempt to go after every problem I had with this movie so I just made a VERY short list. Too many small details to trash.<br /><br />My main complaints:<br /><br />Lois Lane should not be such a huge part of a Superman movie. I know, I know, it’s Lois Lane, right? Of COURSE she’s going to be a huge part of a Superman movie!!! Okay, but she shouldn’t be in nearly every scene, in every plot point, in nearly every way moving the whole story along. She’s on screen WAY too much and made me stop enjoying the movie and say “Hey, that’s a little too convenient and coincidental” more than once.<br /><br />The word “maybe” should never be uttered in a Superman movie when discussing whether or not Superman should let a bus full of children die. This should especially be the case when the one uttering the word is his father. (And I don’t care if he was “just Clark” or “just a kid” at that point in the movie! It’s still Superman, and it shouldn’t even be an issue! Of COURSE Superman / Clark Kent / Kal El would never let a bus load of children drown! What is wrong with you people that think this is okay????)<br /><br />Lois Lane should not be such a huge part of a Superman mov - Oh wait I already went over that. Well let’s go over it again...Having Lois Lane romantically linked to Clark / Superman by the first half of the first movie in a new series removes most of the mystery and romanticism involved in their story. Besides, Lois Lane should’ve been reporting, because she’s a reporter, not Superman’s sidekick. Especially not inthe first part of Superman’s story.<br /><br />The story was packed too full. It didn’t give itself time to breathe, much less the audience time to breathe. It seemed like it was convoluted just to be thick. Most of the stuff crammed into the movie served no purpose to the story. It was a rehash of the old Superman 2 with a bunch of extra technical mumbo-jumbo stuffed in to make it all seem “bigger” and “bolder” and “more exciting”. “World engines”, “Codex”, “Hyperdrives”. Rubbish.<br /><br />Most of the CGI looked just like other CGI. It wasn’t this great innovation like I’ve heard other viewers describe it (for whatever weird reasons).<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Unlike a lot of people, I didn’t mind the destruction or Superman killing Zod. I did like the Krypton scenes (Although I thought the flying dragon thing was stupid because, as others have pointed out, it looked just like stuff we’ve seen before in other movies) and I liked the launching of baby Superman and the story of Krypton’s destruction.<br /><br />I liked the flashbacks.<br /><br />I liked the action of the movie.<br /><br />I liked when Clark became Superman.<br /><br />I liked the music, although it seemed like the Superman theme was repeated every 30 seconds or so.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this movie was just okay. Nothing new, nothing great. An action movie with Superman in it.
B008602KQI|5.0|i loved this movie got to look past the kids killing each other and look at the real story  behind the movie
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|It's great but it should have a help menu because I've been stuck in north Pacific because I don't know how I can get a heart shot so that's the only bad thing otherwise it's awesome please someone tell me how that would be great kindle fire

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Sexy and fun, this show has the best of drama, and end of your seat suspense.  The cast is extremely talented and really pull you in.  Twisted plot and intentions, you're going to love this show.
B00DM0UTPQ|2.0|It would've helped if they would've at least faked Russian accents a little. Some good actors, a fair story but what you wind up with is a bunch of Americans on an old Foxtrot boat. I wanted to like it but it just didn't work. K19 was a far better view of what might go on in the Soviet Navy even with Harrison Ford obviously &#34;trying&#34; to sound Russian but this one doesn't cut it. If you just like Sub movies no matter what, fine. Otherwise it's no better than another $5 movie that you Might want to put on your shelf.
B00G32OMF8|5.0|It is the perfect continuation of Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.  Realistic, not corny, tense moments.  just nice.  Really nice.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I find this game epic because it is very realistic and adventurous, adictive, and well thought out.<br /><br />Adding on, there could be a few features added such as:<br />&Acirc;&middot;Hardmode after defeating the W.O.F. (and for it to drop the pwnhammer).<br />&Acirc;&middot;The enemies/bosses/items/NPC's added In 1.2 on the computer should be added to the game.<br />&Acirc;&middot;The new 1.2 textures should be added to the game.<br />&Acirc;&middot;There should be bigger world generation and difficulty settings for the player and the world should be added.<br /><br />Those are the things I like about the game and the things I think should be added to the game.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was impossible to lay down once I started reading it; an amazing story of perseverance and courage. I highly recommend it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I gave this app 4 stars because it is difficult to play on my small Kindle Fire. Otherwise it is fine.
B002WY64HA|5.0|One of the best albums of the 2000's. Arcade Fire debut remains probabbly their best and listening to it in vinyl is just amazing.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|You should get this game; You will be surprised at how awesome it is! The most fun part of the game to me is the championship matches!
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|Compare to the other Angry Birds that I have, this one I didn't like besides I have to have wifi on all the time to use it on my kindle.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Believe me, this game is incredible but does require a decent amount of strategy.  I don't think I've ever played a mobile game requiring this much strategy. But, because of the strategy need it does force the gears to turn in your brain and plan unlike most games. Again, incredible game, wish the expansions weren't $2 a piece but can't really complain.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Digital puzzles are the perfect game for a tablet.  The app works well and helped me eat up a lot of time on my long flights.  I just wish there was a better variety of background music. Also eats up battery life pretty quickly.
B005USZYDU|3.0|I think that this whole series can be one book and be good. I think that the ending could be better becaus it was like blaha. The beginning was good and the plot pulled me in but in the middle it got boring and really hard to read. I had to push on it was not easy. So I recommend this book  to people who like mystery and realistic fiction. Hope you like the book.<br /><br />  Angel
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|Very east to laugh at this movie. So if you want yo watch something that does require a lot of effort this is a good one. And Jennifer looks HOT!
0763660531|5.0|Such a beautiful book.  I'd like my son to grow up with creative imagination and this book, I think, opened the door for what an imagination can do and where it can take us.  I liked the fact that there was no words so it was an enthusiastic challenge for me to find the right dialogue that matches with each page.  But because the picture tells everything, it's nothing hard at all to just imagine the conversation, so it's great fun for both my son and me.  I want to buy this for my niece and nephew too.
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|Its good but not yet great. I like the premise and see lots of room for it to get great especially if they bring in Thor and weave all the marvel story lines together but right now its playing toø small. Too much build up for small revelations. The plots are formulaic. The actors are all very appealing and doing a good job so i will keep watching and hope the writing gets better.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I wish I had seen this movie in the theater.  It's definitely the best film of the year, I felt.  Simply put, it was &#34;FUN&#34; throughout the movie. I finished with such a fulfillment.  I am not a comic book reader nor a fan/follower of superman but even as a beginner, you will get hooked and want to pursue it because of this movie.  So much thanks to the film maker staff, I really really enjoyed it!  We need this type of film at least once a year.  Nothing too emotionally painful, but emotional/sentimental enough, great action but not gross/bloody scenes, great visuals, plot, actions and acting.  Yeah!!!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|RED was fun and new. RED 2 tried to be that as well. It didn't quite make it. John malkovich was funny. I recommend it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the world although an historical fiction read like a sweeping but detailed account of ordinary and extraordinary contributors to acts of pre war, Waring and immediate postwar decisions.  FOLLETT.s maniacal skilled genius lies in his understanding that major historical decisions and acts are not arrived at or committed by the upper echelons of our world's stratified societies but instead by a series of small personal indignation that played themselves out politically.<br />My prediction for FOLLETT.s last installment  is one spanning the Vietnam conflict and U.S. Civil Rights Movements since there is now the prescience if Jacky Jake's and her and Greg's son.  I am thrilled about that possibility since there was no mention of The Tuskeegee Airmen and their escorting U.S. bombers during some bombing missions and their success rate.<br />Ken FOLLETT I am almost in live with you and would like to work for you.  You do history proud.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|This bookunfolded at a good pace.i could not picture these characters though.it was a thriller.i would recomand it other adults.
B009ZM74F8|1.0|I must first admit that I didn't watch the whole movie. As a matter of fact, I couldn't get through the first thirty minutes. The fundamental premise of the plot is contradictory. Human emotion causes pain (i.e., war), so we must eradicate everything that stirs emotion (e.g., art, literature, music, etc...). However, it is perfectly acceptable to feel some emotions, such as joy, pride and enthusiasm. Maybe by the end of the movie it is recognized that all emotions co-exist, but I couldn't stop thinking about how it was okay for the &#34;government&#34; to emotionally persuade the populace, but not the individual.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book... I love adventures with multiple ways that it could go to I love cliff hangers at the end on each chapter when reading it in ELA at school. I would highly recommend this book for anyone into adventure and scary characters. :)

B00A11AN6O|2.0|I'm starting with a 2 and here is why,<br />I just recently got tablet with camera and had downloaded the cloud photo storage. Today I took some photos and then loaded them to the cloud. I naturally assumed there would be some way to share with my desktop machine; (there is sort of) -When I got to the desktop I went to download the windows desktop version and found it to be unavailable for download. So what I have now is pretty much pictures I can share by emailing them individually to everyone I want to share with and that includes myself. I think Amazon is taking lessons from Google and Microsoft. Well guys, you'll never get me hooked into the cloud by making it impossible for me to access my own data.<br />(In fairness, there are other public sharing methods like facebook - It's my personal choice to not use those; My intent was to get my pictures to my home media server)

0062107313|3.0|I've read all of Amy Tan's books and enjoyed them, albeit some more than others (The Bonesetter's Daughter was read in a couple of days! I reread The Joy Luck Club every couple of years. Gobbled up A Hundred Secret Senses). One expects long and cross-generational stories, historical perspectives, mystical references and details, details, details. This time around however, perhaps because of the subject matter or maybe because I just wasn't all that interested in the characters, I could not finish the book. And having close to one-third of the book focused on upscale brothel...just didn't help me get into the story. (I've read Memoir of a Geisha and loved it. So it's not that it's a brothel per se.)<br /><br />Writers share the journey of their interests via their work; as their lives evolve, the nature and tone and focus of their stories changes. It seems as if Ms. Tan is in a different place and that's OK. She is still one of my favorites. That said, if you are a Tan fan, don't think this book will necessarily hold your interest in the same way that her other works may have done.

030758836X|2.0|This is the first book by Gillian Flynn I've read, and I picked it up based on a review by a co-worker. For the first half of the book I was totally engrossed, even though the plot seemed to be heading in a pretty formulaic direction. I enjoyed the author's ability to create suspense using hints of dark currents flowing under the visible lives of the characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately the &#34;major plot twist&#34; thrown in mid-way through the book completely defused any building tension and required way too much suspension of disbelief to maintain my interest. From that point on the book dragged along, and the author seemed more focused on explaining away holes in the story than in further development of either plot or character. Eventually the book fizzled limply to an end.<br /><br />It's like the author got distracted midway through this story and went off to write a better book somewhere else.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Need s fun fun games and no purchasing at all.Just needs more ajustments.And plus,I Think 101 games Should have 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, games +1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, and I THINK that the app would be more fun if you add that stuff.

B008C20TDG|5.0|A great book which makes the science behind food and nutrition accessible. New Years resolution will be to do the Whole30 right after the holidays. Have already put some of the concepts to use. Have dropped six pounds and have more energy.
B002361MLA|5.0|&#34;Now&#34; is a well written and thoughtful book explaining the very essence of intelligent &#34;beings&#34;!  Our link to the Cosmos is being in the ever presence, NOW!

B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I am homeschooling my 13 yr. old grandson and we chose this for literature rather than Dicken's Tale of Two Cities. He liked it better and wrote a report on each chapter. I read it too so we could discuss it, Mark Twain has a great sense of humor.

Unfortunately, while this is supposedly remastered and in HD, it looks like an eight year old managed the process!  4 stars for the movie, one star for the video quality!  Damn shame!

B00FEX2ZFG|5.0|Pretty good and intense movie.  I think they compress a lot of the actually story line but all together it was pretty good.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Satisfied. Thank you for letting me live in this other world with these fantastic characters, at least for a little while. I will recommend this trilogy often to my middle school students and my adult friends. One of the best to come along in awhile.<br /><br />Because I am not a spoiler, I will not give details but the realistic portrayal of the love story versus some of the more recent series for impressionable young people is refreshing. The setting of a futuristic Chicago, a city that is a personal favorite, made this series extra interesting for me.  Exploring ourselves as peacekeepers, givers, daredevils, knowledge-seekers, and truth-tellers - and which of these traits is our strength - is fascinating. Roth does this with simply a great story.

B00CE613FE|5.0|This medium zoom lens for the X-mount system (Fuji) demonstrates just what's possible when a camera company really puts their mind to it. I had been reading a number of reviews of the Fuji X-mount system for some time, but it was only this past month that I started using the system myself, and I have to say that my own experience has certainly validated what I'd read so many others say: the Fuji X-mount system, in spite of its smaller format, rivals the best of Canon and Nikon's popular models, and some even claim that the Fuji's perform up to Leica and (real) Zeiss levels. I hate to keep repeating myself, but, Wow.<br /><br />This medium zoom range lens starts at 55mm and goes up to 200mm. It's not a particularly fast lens (it's aperture only opens to F/3.5 at the wide end), but that misses the point entirely. With the insanely good high ISO performance that most Fuji X-mount cameras exhibit, it simply becomes less and less of an issue that you can only work within F/3.5 - 4.5. You can ramp the ISO level up to 1600 and even 3200 and almost not notice it at all, and just read what many others have said about this to see if what I'm saying is repeated elsewhere. For me, its absolutely been the case.<br /><br />But back to this lens. The image quality produced by this lens across its focal range almost makes you think you're shooting with a prime. That's a tad of an exaggeration, but not much. Images are sharp, colorful, and detailed. The images remind me of my favorite Zeiss lenses, but then, when I shot with those, ISO was a factor even at 800. Coupled with your favorite Fuji X camera (take your pick of model), you'll be able to knock off quality shots that are sometimes simply amazing.<br /><br />Drawbacks? There is one. The weight and size of this lens is not exactly in line with the diminutive Fuji X cameras, which tend to be light and small. This means that you are in a bit of an off-balanced situation, because at some 560g, the weight will now be to the FRONT of your camera, and you'll have to adjust your shooting grip accordingly. (Most of the Fuji X lenses, including the spectacular 14mm and the 35mm models, are extremely light). So, you have to understand this going into this lens.<br /><br />But, once you do, and you start looking at your images, you may no longer be as \\"put off\\" by the lens' much heavier weight than its lighter brothers. Just adjust your shooting technique.<br /><br />The optical image stabilization on this lens works very well. (You can also turn it off with a mechanical switch on the lens). And the lens also has dedicated aperture and manual focus rings, so if you like to shoot without auto functionality, you can do it easily. The mechanical build quality of the lens is good to very-good, with a nearly all-metal construction, tight fit and finish. Unfortunately, no case is provided with the lens, which, at this cost, would have been a nice touch. And, like many lens \\"systems,\\" there is not perfect uniformity of filter size from lens to lens. But taken as a whole, when you consider the image quality, the build quality, and, yes, the price, this is a fantastic lens that most any Fuji owner will enjoy.<br /><br />It's great to see a camera company moving forward with technology and not rest on old technology barriers until they are completely exhausted. If you have not looked into the Fuji X system yet, start reading the reviews posted on many professional camera review sites, and compare them with the reviews of Fuji owners here on Amazon and other sellers. This lens is an easy five star recommendation, in spite of its weight and somewhat high price.<br /><br />Update after one month of shooting ...<br />After using this lens for the past month in northern and central France, I can report: WOW. The quality of the images this lens is capable of is truly superb. You have to work around the lens' limitations: it starts at a pretty narrow 55mm, and the physical weight is much greater than many of the Fuji X-mount lenses. But the images the lens can produce are simply stellar. Sharp, sharp, sharp. Beautiful color. And the image stabilization on this lens is much better than those I've seen on other lenses. The ability to flip off stabilization with a mechanical switch is a real plus, too, as is the ability to switch to manual aperture with a physical switch and also to manually focus with a dedicated focus ring all are \\"gravy\\" on top. But the quality of the lens is simply stellar, arguably putting it in a league with far more expensive lenses (some compare it to Leica professional lenses), and I can clearly see why. Fuji is now (January, 2014) promising at least 20 new X-mount lenses in the near future, but this 55-200mm XF lens is not to be missed while we are waiting for those, and, if the lens is in the range you require, you'll want it regardless of any new lenses that are produced.i X-mount lenses.

With the new update there is even more to like about it. There is a mall to run in and also fun daily challenges where you get to collect babbles. If you have been looking for an app to buy then you have definitely found it. It has great content for a wonderful price. This was one of the first apps I bought on my new kindle HDX and I'm glad I did buy it. The minions are so adorable. And just when I thought I was addicted well my little sister is always asking to play. It is one of the best apps I have ever bought and if liked temple run or subway surfers this will be an app you will never be able to but down.

Don't get me wrong, I love her new short stories that expand on the characters and narrative, but it's my humble opinion that her time would be better spent on writing another alternate ending...one that does justice to Tris, Four, and Tori, just to name a few!

0553582038|3.0|Book four of A Song of Ice and Fire is a little bit of a disappointment following, the excellent A Storm of Swords. Probably the best thing about it is that we learn a lot more of the world and history of George R.R. Martin's world. However the unfortunate flipside of this is that Martin introduces many new characters and plot lines, not an ideal thing four books into the series. I hate to say it, but this probably wouldn't be such a big deal if Martin was a younger man, but with Martin's slow pace of writing and still three books projected to come after this one...<br />The other drawback is the plot lines and characters in A Feast for Crows that Martin has presented in this installment. Besides the new action in the Iron Islands and Dorne, we follow the stories of Jaime, Cersei, Brienne, Sansa, Sam and Arya. So we are missing the most interesting stories, Bran's and John's; as well as the most interesting characters: Tyrion and Dany. Martin promises to get back to these characters in the next book.<br />There is definitely a lot to like in A Feast For Crows, there is just the nagging feeling that Martin is letting the series get away from him.
B000F8O35U|5.0|One of the greatest of all times. Great animated movie for the entire family with a great story that you can see over and over.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Everybody here knows this trilogy: great first movie that they could've just left well enough alone; second flick had mild-but-boring entertainment; third flick turned CGI into a maddening gimmick that burned souls and left them charred and wishing for hand-drawn animation.<br /><br />But this IS a good set. Three stars for the movies, four or five for the set.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|It's great st firs but at a certain point they make you pay for something called camcoins and once you've made a certain amount of videos you have to pay or sign up for a lot of stuff

B00DHNJGCU|1.0|This movie was terrible.  To bad it was not better. The ship used in the movie is the  US United States. If the movie was better it might have brought more attention to the ships  plight.
B008DYZKQE|2.0|Great story of an enterprising young lady, at least till the last two pages. The book then takes a bizarre twist and instead of bing grateful,  the prince insults his rescuer and in turn she calls him a &#34;bum&#34;...

B008JFUO72|4.0|\\"Iron Man 3\\" picks up after 2012's \\"The Avengers\\", with Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) suffering panic attacks as a result of battling aliens in that movie. He copes by building more Iron Man suits and trying obsessively to perfect the Mark 42 suit, which can home in on him and attach itself to Stark in pieces wherever he may be -when it works. Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow) carries on as CEO of Stark Industries, but she's annoyed and concerned by Tony's behavior. On the news, a self-proclaimed terrorist named \\"The Mandarin\\" takes responsibility for a string of bombings of US targets. The White House believes this is national business, not superhero business, so they call in Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) in the form of \\"Iron Patriot\\" to deal with it. But when Stark Industries' chief of security (John Favreau) is seriously injured in a bombing, Tony Stark vows revenge.<br /><br />Shane Black has replaced John Favreau in the director's seat, and he co-wrote \\"Iron Man 3\\" with Drew Pearce as well. This is a stronger entry in the franchise than \\"Iron Man 2\\", which suffered from too many characters and subplots. Tony Stark does a lot of work without his suit this time, which allows Robert Downey, Jr. more screen time. With the franchise's characteristic humor, the film pokes fun at celebrity, actors, and technology, the very things it promotes. But \\"Iron Man 3\\" is more a morality play than even the first installment. And it doesn't shy away from political commentary. It's a stronger film for that, but by no means perfect. We see too many remote-controlled suits, which are not interesting and defeat the idea of a superhero. The final battle is boring. Apart than that, it's pretty good -though I kind of liked Stark better when he was a big, rich jerk.

B00009L1UP|5.0|This remaster w/bonus tracks is just phenomenal. The remaster was done without brickwalling or compression distortion. Now, I looked this release up on dr.loudness-wars.info, and it said the dynamic compression was measured in the \\"bad\\" range. I listened to it on a mid-range stereo system (Denon) and I thought it sounded clean and clear to me.<br />  I say Bravo! to the Mastering Engineer!

B00338QEKQ|5.0|Winston’s War, Churchill, 1940 – 1945 by Max Hastings, is a masterful review of the times and the man.  Mr. Hastings is an engaging writer easily mixing rather cold facts with pointed stories to keep the reader interested.  This book moves along very quickly and will be thoroughly enjoyed by anyone interested in Winston Churchill or WWII.  The footnotes and resources listed are voluminous and the maps, the few that are included, are excellent.<br /><br />Of course, we must admit there are many books on WWII and on Mr. Churchill; however, I think Mr. Hastings has added something to the previous story.  The author obviously holds Mr. Churchill in notable esteem and contends he towered above other figures that held the stage of history with him.  The war was his finest hour.  What is new is Max Hastings clearly sees the flaws in the man and his country.  Mr. Hastings has an incredible ability to boil down the essence of what was going on in the war and then accurately relate those events to the leaders.  He unerringly describes how the leaders of the US, UK, and USSR mixed together and how that mix impacted the decisions of that age.<br /><br />Mr. Hastings recognizes the irony of going to war to keep the Nazi’s out of Poland and then watching them fall under a greater evil in Stalin’s communist.  He records Churchill’s despairing struggle to prevent it.<br /><br />Winston’s War poignantly points out how Churchill, with his back against the wall, managed to weld the nation together long enough to pull it through the worst times in 1940 only to watch it gradually fall apart as the war progressed to a victorious conclusion.  He was the man for the hour, but he was not the man for all hours.  Winston Churchill was a 19th century man, and could not lead a 20th century nation into the future.  Churchill saw it was a future of socialism, which he rejected, but could not come up with the means to fight.  At least the future he secured for the UK was not one of rule by a foreign tyranny.<br /><br />The author is able to balance, better than other authors on Churchill I have read, the legitimate criticisms of the man with the reality of his accomplishments.  Comparing the good to the bad in a fair and responsible way is not easy, not in the least; however, Mr. Max Hastings does it as well as any man could.<br /><br />Mr. Hasting’s insights on WWII are worth the price of the book all by themselves.  He understands the power of the German Army and identifies them as the best army in the field during WWII.  The author perceptively points out a few German divisions gave the allies fits in Africa and Italy and affirms that without the Soviet Union England and the US could not have defeated Hitler.  Mr. Hastings peppers his writings with these blunt insights which helps us understand the decisions of the time better than most books which relate the arguments but not the unvarnished truth that was being confronted.<br /><br />An excellent and nearly flawless book.<br /><br />AD2gn tyranny.<br /><br />The author is able to balance, better than other authors on Churchill I have read, the legitimate criticisms of the man with the reality of his accomplishments.

B00GHJ25C4|2.0|When it has came down to Lady Gaga, she has lost her crown in her music and her message from driven voice and innovation from her music. She had a lot to prove and she didn't find it with her recent music. Sadly, with her new music, it really has been more of a miss than a strike. Applause, the lead single from her third album Artpop is actually not one of her better songs. In fact, it felt definitely weaker than a lot of the tracks she did from her last album Born This Way, and I wasn't impressed with the bulk of the songs from that record either. I think for her and for her little monster fans, maybe Lady Gaga should take a break and find her voice again with her songs and than she'll find more for her fans to applause.<br /><br />Song: D
B00FANXZL8|5.0|Really great Bowie album-if you don't have it, go for this box set. The additional tracks , though not essential when compared with the deluxe version, are worthwhile-the videos are terrific and it's nice to have pristine copies for posterity,  (even though I've seen them on youtube many times).The packaging is wonderful-it feels like a work of art-which it is-let's face it-It's a new David Bowie cd. i thought it would never happen-so glad it did. Please sir-can we have some more?

B0036EH3TS|5.0|There are as many summaries of the plot, opinions on the acting, music, portents as there are reviews here so I will only focus on the quality of the actual Blu Ray transfer and my rating is based upon that.  Often with technical reviews much depends upon the T.V. and home theater system the reviewer is using and how they see and hear things.  My own 7.1 system if quite esoterically high end and the monitor I am using is a Panasonic ZT 65&#34; plasma.<br />While I have watched the Standard Def DVD many times which was not badly produced at all, the Blu Ray is a significant upgrade. This review, however, is not a side by side comparison, that said, I wish Amazon would please separate the Standard Def, Instant Downloads and Blu Ray reviews from each other.  It would make it that much easier to find a review that fits your needs and interests.<br /><br />VIDEO….<br />  Extraordinarily clean transfer with no artifacts that I could see anywhere.  Grain did not seem to be present nor was there any haloing saw during CGI scenes.  Blacks were extremely deep without sacrificing details in even the darkest of shots.  Contrast is excellent throughout the film.  Color grading appeared to be very normal, warm actually until they get to the asteroid where the color grading becomes decidedly cool with a very slight bluish tinge.  This is one of the better transfers to Blu Ray I have seen with Mbps rates generally averaging in the low to mid 30's.<br /><br />AUDIO….<br />  The audio is a lossless 5.1 DTS MA HD which I wish also came with a 7.1 option.  Dialogue was clean and transparent throughout and there was no need to reset your remotes volume control due to audio roller coasting; it stayed consistently set.  Armageddon, in its own way, comes with one of the very best audios to be found.  All channels are widely used, especially so during the outer space action scenes.  In this case, discreet directionality steering of audio to the surrounds is found more with expansive ambient audio rather than small foley fx.  Unlike other films with fantastic audio directionality like U-571 or Das Boot where the surrounds discreetly use the dropping of a pencil or the ticking of a clock, Armageddon uses the massive sounds of the jets flying by left and right, meteorites whizzing by and exploding to fully immerse you in the scenario.  Armageddon has some of the very best ambient audio on any disc with not only front to rear but rear to front panning and a very engaging surround experience.<br /><br />EXTRAS…<br />  Not a whole lot, the Aerosmith music video, a trailer and teaser.  I really don't see any difference between a trailer and teaser.<br />The one really negative thing on this Blu Ray and many more are the 6 separate advertisements (they call them 'previews' for other films.  I really do hate these things as they just take up more room on the disc which causes for more compression of the actual film you are paying for.  Besides, who needs or wants advertisements for movies released ten years ago.<br /><br />Despite the ads, the Blu Ray of Armageddon comes well recommended.<br />I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.<br />Thank you for reading.ient audio rather than small foley fx.

B00008G8LN|5.0|Totally out of sight out of mind. Classic movie. Point Break is better than anything that you've heard about it.  It has all the bells and whistles that you could want.  Cool actors, action packed from start to finish, almost comedic dialogue that keeps your interest, plus its a thrill ride with great photography, surfing, sky diving, car chasing, and some good bank robbing scenes.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|If you liked the Facebook game, you will like this. Gets a bit frustrating when you don't want to spend real money but it's all still doable, just takes an extra long time to do stuff.

B009YJEKJK|5.0|I guess John Travolta' s voice isn't quite as polished as it once was but it's typical Travolta in kind of a casual, lighthearted manner of singing. Olivia is great, as always. If you have nostalgic feelings for Grease, the musical from &#34;OMG-was-it-really that-many-years-ago&#34; you'll probably find this charming, like I did. I usually buy an album or two each holiday season and after a while so many sound similar. I like this because it's a little bit different. My favorites are &#34;Baby it's Cold Outside&#34; and &#34;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&#34;. Both capture what I like about these two voices together.

0062107313|3.0|Amy Tan's first novel in eight years buries potentially interesting material under melodramatic twists and mounds of bland, unnecessary, unsubtle prose. Protagonist Violet is the daughter of Lulu Mintern, the American mistress of a courtesan house in early twentieth century Shanghai. Unsurprisingly in a Tan novel, Violet's relationship with her mother is a difficult one, burdened by Violet's immaturity and Lulu's secrets, which include the identity of Violet's father. After a sudden separation, Violet must learn to make her own way in the strict, pitiless world of Shanghai's.courtesan houses as they respond to the social changes brought on by the fall of the Qing Dynasty. This is a setting worthy of a great historical novel, but Tan presents historical and cultural detail mostly in lumps of leaden exposition; an entire chapter shifts away from Violet's first-person narration to that of someone explaining the rules of courtesan houses. Not that there's much difference between the two voices anyway. In fact, everyone speaks a stilted, formal language, expressing their emotional states and thematic purposes so clearly that the book could serve as its own Cliff Notes. The prose is competent in its colorless way, and can pull the reader along despite the relaxed pace, but ridiculous plot twists disrupt the flow, drawing the novel's weaknesses back into focus. As a potboiler with a period setting this is passable, but the utter lack of artfulness and emotional immediacy will disappoint many who've enjoyed Tan's earlier novels.

B004UJAOLM|4.0|A good clean version of the novel.  It was an enjoyable read, but you have to get used to the obsolete vocabulary.
B003Z49N10|1.0|This movie was extremely depressing! The amount of bad things that occurred in this poor woman's life was unreal. The movie could have worked but they seemed to pack in so much depressing drama in such a short amount of time, it made it painful to watch. The pacing of the movie was a bit awkward. Her downfall was her unrealistic outlook on life and her &#34;head in the clouds&#34; worldview. It was as if she was destined to a horrible lot in life and no matter how much she tried, life never turned out. BTW, they really should have aged her younger siblings correctly. Years had supposedly passed but the kids never aged....Overall, this movie had so much potential but I'm sorry to say it was a real disappointment. So I would recommend to skip this wrist slashing movie and view another.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Have you ever read that one book that just got you THINKING? That one book you can't put down, that book that immediately becomes your favorite upon reading? TFIOS was that book for me. TFIOS was the book that put me on a quest to read any and all John Green novels I could get on my hands. I started Looking for Alaska, I'm already halfway done.<br />TFIOS was relate able to me, like I'm sure it was to a lot of other readers. With my mother (the owner of the account from which I am writing this review) in the midst of her battle against non small cell lung cancer (a nonsmoker's cancer) I felt Hazel's understanding of life and death was helpful to my understanding of my mom's battle. &#34;depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying&#34; never have I read a novel, in all my 16 years of loving to read amazing novels, have I read a piece of art in which such a hard hitting quote can be found on the first page of chapter one.<br />Thank you, John Green. I love you.

B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I found this book highly entertaining, as I do all the Scarpetta books. I don't give away spoilers because I think everyone should read it for themselves and create their own opinion on how they thought the story line worked. My review of any Scarpetta book is the same, I always enjoy them. The only issue I personally had was I wish the ending took longer. Sometimes the ending wraps up too quick. My reasoning for this is simple - I want any Cornwell book to last longer. I always get depressed when I'm done because I know it will be at least a year before there is another one to read. I know there are those that have their issues with the books but they have to remember we are 21 books into a series about the same people. Lives change and the books reflect that. The characters are not going to be the same as they were in the beginning and I for one am glad. If they were we would be reading the same book over and over. Our lives change, so why wouldn't theirs? I guess some people just want to live in the past.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is suppose to be one of those rare book that comes along every so often and change your outlook on life. It's sad, depressing and makes you really think on what is most important in life. Did it succeed in doing that for me personally? Honestly, I wouldn't really say so as I've definitely read other more life changing stories that The Book Thief but that isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the book. It is definitely something special and I'm extremely glad that a movie was made of it as it broadens the audience members. Instead of always watching mindless action flicks, I hope more movie-goers give this movie a chance in hopes of experiencing something a little different than what they are normally used to.<br /><br />If you've never liked stories that uses a war torn WWII Germany as the backdrop, then well, that's exactly what you'll be getting here! Personally, I can never tire of it. It usually makes for a somewhat depressing yet captivating story. The Book Thief is told through the eyes of a very special &#34;narrator&#34; and I'm sure that if you've read some of the other reviews for the book, someone somewhere must have given it away. Luckily for me, I just picked up the book and started reading without every going through one user review at all. It does make for a very interesting narrative as you'll follow along in the childhood of Liesel Meminger of Himmel Street. Being very poor, there's not much that Liesel can do that requires money. Eventually though, Liesel finds that she would come alive through the power of words in a book. As the title already gave it away, stealing books would become one of Liesel's favorite hobbies.<br /><br />What I liked most about The Book Thief is the poetic nature of the author's writing. He never lost me for one moment throughout the book, which is quite lengthy if I think about it now. The author just finds a way to write ever so smoothly from page to page and once you discover who the narrator is, the poetic style of writing feels even more haunting and chilling to say the least. It might put some readers off in the beginning but if you stick with it, you'll feel right at home after a few chapters in. What I'm most disappointed with in The Book Thief is that well, I actually thought it would involve more book stealing! I thought it would involve Liesel finding more clever ways to get her next book in the collection but it's not really about that. The characters in the story are a bit dry as they just seem to remain the same throughout the book save for a few instances. On a positive note however, I still can say that there were many memorable pieces sprinkled throughout the book to makeup for the negatives.<br /><br />The Book Thief in my opinion definitely deserves its praises but everything is with fault and so is this book. When you have such a highly rated and popular book, there are bound to be many readers who gets sucked into the hype only to realize that its not worth it. That is fine because you can't create something that everyone will like. The Book Thief gives me yet another look into one of the darkest periods of mankind and for that it was worth reading in my eyes.s, the poetic style of writing feels even more haunting and chilling to say the least.

B007G5K066|1.0|A lumbering telling of a compelling story that is completely lost in this film. Gary Oldman's performance is excellent simply because he is given absolutely nothing to do and somehow makes that inaction feel important or relevant.  Long scenes of him doing nothing but contemplation with far-a-way ponderances rob this film of any momentum or suspense.  It's a good story the deserved better direction and plotting.  I suggest reading the book; yes it will take you longer but it won't feel nearly as long as sitting through this bore.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It's a very helpful book that taught me a lot about myself and the people I love. I recommend it to anyone who has trouble understanding their loved ones. It gives you a bit of insight on them and how to love them better.
B00CATSONE|3.0|After reading your book it has given fuel to the dream l pursue, to be a great Engineer. I  have a chance of a job in another country and I feel your book is the sign, that I should seize this opportunity. Having read the many trials that Tesla had faced for his dreams, I'll never give up on mine. Thank you for this wonderful insight on this complex character, called Tesla.<br /><br />Regards, Seukaran Motilal.<br />Email: naradatt@yahoo.com
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is definitely worth the purchase! I found it to be very realistic and there are so many options for styling! Best hair game that I could find!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|Great movie.Based on true events that occurred in one of the paranormal investigations by the Warrens.Starting off with an interesting investigation story about a demonic doll.wonderful acting,great effects.creepy to the very end.
B00FEN000S|4.0|Great movie the action scenes always got my adrenaline pumping, the only big gripe i had with the movie is that the Russian and Chinese jaegers died way too quickly. They had a huge buildup only to die in a few minutes. Also the two nerds were annoying and everything else happening when the pilots weren't fighting monsters, but when the action starts its amazing.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Great Controller, I'm still breaking it in for playing Super Smash Bros. Melee competitively but so far so good!<br /><br />Pros: works like a charm, long cord, looks beautiful<br /><br />Cons: none so far
B004X6PRO6|5.0|My favorite book from last year.  Let's face it...there are not too many fiction books about North Korea and I felt I learned a lot.  Well written and a good story.
0375826726|5.0|So many unexpected things happened. At times I wanted to throw the book against the wall for the things that happened and also at times I cried. Brisingr is a wonderful book and I can&#34;t wait to buy Inheritance and hopefully a fifth!  Atra du evarinya ono varda, Christopher-vodhr!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Great app. Freezes sometimes and some videos take a while to download, and there are lots of ads, especially right in the middle of the screen while the video is loading. Otherwise, it's easy to use and is set up just like the actual site.
B004MYFV0O|5.0|I spent awhile going through different books to help improve my sketching. While this one may seem basic, it is one of the better ones I had found. I bought it to help my boys and myself. We have all seen great improvements in our sketches. It really helped a lot. I am glad I bought it. My friends who are more artistic and even a couple who are professional artists have commented on how my drawings have greatly improved. Due to the name I really thought this would be one I would pass by quickly. However, I found myself returning to it. Eventually, it was the only one I was practicing from. I highly recommend this book.
B00DJWV11I|3.0|This book made me laugh out loud on several occasions. If you are looking for a light and quick read this is it.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Good plot, excellent casting, the multifaceted and suspenseful story line kept me riveted to my seat throughout the show.  This is one of Showtime's best series ever!
B00BL9860K|5.0|Great read. I wasn't sure how the saga of King and Maxwell would continue but this story kept me going to the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush Saga and I am so glad Amazon finally got it.  I find the game easier to play on a tablet as opposed to my laptop.  Even though I stay stuck on a level for days and sometimes weeks, I still enjoy playing.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|It was so very much fun, a bit mysterious, and on a very needed topic of spreading kindness in the world.  I'm planning on buying several of the paper back books to give as Xmas gifts.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|a fun game<br /> It was a good game but harder that most other running games.<br />I really liked it a lot.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|This is a very very fun movie for the whole family to watch. With lots of humor and great animation.
B00340ESIS|5.0|If all writers read this and had a system similar to this there would be much less writers block and much better quality novels and movies overall.<br /><br />Some people seem to take this book too literally and get hung up in small details like how he says you need to have this and that on exactly such and such page. Overall the structure presented in this book is gold to any writer.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is the best game ever! It is really challenging. The objects are small and a dark color and finding them is a challenge. This is a spectacular game and I would recommend it to anybody.
0385537131|1.0|A good novel will keep the reader interested and hopefully guessing about the outcome until near the end.  This book does neither.<br />I found myself skimming to get to what I already knew.  Anyone thinking about becoming a lawyer should read this and after realizing how boring and tedious that profession is in reality, like the book, will opt out.
B001MM28JG|5.0|Galaxy Quest is a lot of fun and was highly under rated when it was released. A campy Space Si Fi classic, it has become an all time favorite of mine. Star Trek will never be same after seeing this one. Clever writing and good direction throughout. The cast does a great job of selling the premise of the story. Amongst this immensely talented cast Enrico Colantoni as Mathesar, the alien leader is an absolute stand out. After watching his contribution you'll see what I mean. There should have been a sequel to this movie.
B00BC254I8|5.0|Wow!<br />Open. Raw. Real. Mike Tyson tells it like it is.<br />You hear him. Feel him. Totally.<br />He takes you to the darkest depths of his soul and bares<br />his demons for all to see. Don't be surprised if you find yourself routing for him the darker the story gets.<br /><br />What i loved about this book is it's not sugar coated for readers to sympathize with Mike Tyson.<br />It's told with brutal honesty that somehow still manages to draw you in.<br />I had withdrawal symptoms every time i put it down.<br />I just couldn't wait to get back to it.<br />There's no dull moment from the first word to the last.<br /><br />I even found myself laughing out loud in some sections because Mike Tyson can pack a humorous punch too.<br />It's the best biography I've read and I've read many.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. It'll stay with you long after you've finished reading it.
B0037UUZQY|5.0|Cute little doll for the price. The quality and style you would expect for a little girls toy would buy again
0062107313|5.0|Amy Tan is probably the only writer that I eagerly await and enjoy reading each new work. When I received this book I thought back to all of the stories i had enjoyed before - they are old friends with welcome memories. I am surprised at some of the reviews of this book but it really does not matter because people will never agree and I guess you cannot be a top reviewer without being somewhat critical.<br /><br />Personally, I enjoyed reading every page and am recommending it to my friends. I was only disappointed when the story ended and as usual I would love to read more.<br /><br />Amy easily transports me to another place and time - I am very grateful for her talent and a huge fan.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have enjoyed candy crush on Facebook for as long as I can remember. I am so happy that it finally is out for kindle fire this is great.<br />I hope that all Kindle fire users get this app.
B000CZ0Q5W|1.0|Still life (Talking) by Pat Metheny was poor quality. I didn't sound like the original. I wouldn't recommend this product.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved it!!!<br />I was looking forward to this follow up and it did not disappoint.<br />The storyline is terrific!<br />Don't wait for the paperback.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|It's so much fun I play this game all the time. I would play this game if I were you.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|cute and wonderfual, especiallly the aminals , she takes fancy on them and feed them some artificial foods. very interesting
B00E9A656K|5.0|I love this game because I love racing and I like the car's that is why I like this game.
1607066017|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite comics. I love space opera, I love crazy aliens, and I love well-crafted characters and stories...and this series delivers all of those and more. It's an adventure through a creative and beautifully drawn universe. Love it!
B008ZVNC2O|5.0|This guy has the chops to sing classic soul and blues music, always has as a member of Simply Red. But here he puts his terrific voice and innate soul into songs we consider classic. I highly recommend it, I'm a huge fan. He and Simply Red were always great in person, but here on this recording he doesn't lose a thing in energy and depth. It's obvious how much he loves this music.
B007SVPZMW|2.0|Just wasn't fun or challenging enough. It might be fine for small children but not for adults.  I was bored right away.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|so think it's fun and then gets really boring add something new except<br /> changing the background but it's fun!!!!!!for a little part of time
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very challenging, requires patience and skills. This game is very addictive and very easy to learn. I give the game 5 stars and recommended for others to try out.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I love it - no more changing batteries!  Now if I can only get my wife to remember to place the mouse on the charging pad.
B00GI8AMI8|2.0|I am way to impatient to play this without a little bit of help, please, I'm begging you. I'm probably half way through this game, but I give up, will be sending it to the &quot;cloud&quot; on my Kindle because without a hint I swear I have no idea where to go from here.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game totally tubular love it it is the bomb dot com for the whole family for sure it is really cool and fun and trains the brain to be smarter to be a better farter
0385537131|5.0|A Time to Kill was an exceptional book and made me an early Grisham fan; however, I lost interest in his most recent work. I purchased Sycamore Row based on reviews and wasn’t disappointed.  I agree with some other reviewers that it isn’t a true sequel, but a very good read nonetheless.  John Grisham remains one of the best fictional authors of his time.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Best game ever now I can get more costumes and content for my Xbox 360 and experience the app version of this game
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Awesome album from start to finish. Any Eminem fan already bought this, BUT any hip hop fan NEEDS to buy this. Eminem is a force to be reckoned with and this album is no different. He really is the best rapper in the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first it was ok, but the more you play the more you want to play. The levels get harder as you go along. At first the 5 lives you get don't last very long, but you get better so now they last me more than an hour. Then you get to a point in the game that you have to wait 24 hours so it keeps you from finishing the game to soon. You can go back &amp; re play the levels you already beat to get better. Tip: try to get a strip candy &amp; swap with the sprinkled gum ball it turns all that color to strips.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|so addicted to this game and wordly!!! scopely is wonderful! keep up the great work.... &amp;&amp; personally I think its worth it to pay &amp; have the ads removed :)
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Close call whether to rate mid or high.  This is a serious drama.  Actors play it serious.  John Goodman was entertaining as a really annoying character.  Like 'Lost Weekend', believability not as important as The Message.
B000V6MQV4|5.0|Good purchase, great album overall. Good replacement in that my original was stolen. Glad when Amazon offered it for such a great price.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|He idol bbjohnson56@Yahoo and white musicals and white circular with a red rectangle and others are bout that spawned the.
B00C5R7B0I|2.0|I couldnt wait for this book........ it just takes too long to get somewhere.  Love Scarpetta, Marino, Benton and Lucy but there is just something missing.
0553384775|4.0|Jordan Belfort is a very good story teller! I like that Jordan can tell about the wild times as well as the low times. Can't wait until the movie.
B000050HTO|3.0|Typical Dylan.  Nothing extraordinary.  On thing you can count on with this guy.  Every song sounds the same,  I think its time for him to retire.
B000N3ST7K|5.0|glad you had this in stock enjoyed the movie so when i saw you had CD i had to get it to
B008B1VYP0|4.0|I was a little overwhelmed by how explicit the songs were, but overall a great album I really enjoy Maroon 5 and their work.
B0050N3OI2|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest spy-vs-spy storytelling ever to hit the small screen.  Action, drama, romance, comedy, and fast-paced plotlines are all part of the package here.  It's held together by a deadly beautiful assassin called Nikita who's trying to climb out of a sinful past of soul-damning acts by turning on the secret government agency that created her.<br /><br />Sinister conflict and great fight scenes are part of most episodes, but it is the strong characters and superb storytelling that made the first season such a success.  Maggie Q plays Nikita with great heart and charisma, but she is well-backed by the other female lead Lyndsy Fonseca who plays her younger partner-in-espionage Alex.  The cast is rounded out by other solid actors, with each having well-developed characters that we get to know over time.<br /><br />With heroines and heroes to cheer for and villains to hate, this show is a lot of fun to watch.  There are some nice twists and turns along the way, and the pacing is fairly fast throughout.  By the time we reach the season finale, it gets to be a bit of a dizzying ride but is well worth the journey.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I don't understand why she had to kill Tris off...still a good book though. I've been crying a little (yeah, im THAT type of reader) and i just don't understand.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|do not get this app. I tried to download it but every time it finished it said &quot;vtube can not be down loaded.&quot; I was hoping for it to work because my web wasn't working right.
B005LALGCK|4.0|To training and study, its a execelent book! With diferent persons, but it´s missing more young people and teens to be better
0316044695|5.0|Everyone should read the two books by Marcus Luttrell, it should be required reading.  Marcus is my hero and always will be. He deserves some of your time to read and understand some of what our guys fighting for our freedom are going through. There are no braver men than the 4 on the mountain that day.
B000M341QE|5.0|Best movie of all time! came in great condition. nothing wrong with it. love it. if you like thrillers/drama/ cop movies this is the one!
B0000035E7|5.0|This is my favourite album. Its kinda sludgey, its kinda fast and its very aggressive. I enjoy the lyrical content, its not conventional. If you like sludgey, aggressive, raw alternative, this is the album to get.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Excellent season so far, up to ep7. Keeping up the excitement with equal parts drama and character development, and plenty of gross zombies.  I think they are even showing the undead looking messier and starving as time passes. All in all, very stoked to see what's next. Some unexpected twists, a few cliches, but keeping things surprisingly fresh considering the subject matter.
B002VECM72|5.0|One of my favorites films... great!.<br />I can see one time, two times, three times... anytime.<br />Everybody would be see this.
B00F3WO0NS|5.0|love it to the moon and back...<br />twilight used to be my favorite vampire movie. now this is the greatest ever....
1401224806|3.0|Basically, Bigby Wolf encounters a town populated by werewolves, including someone he once knew. Conflict ensues.<br /><br />The book has some good moments and themes, but in the end it feels entirely like the one-off it is.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show keeps getting better all the time. Keeps me intrigued.<br />Can't wait until Season 4!<br />I recommend purchasing all of them.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It's pretty fun it's also a little bit hard as soon as you get far in the game but still very fun
1455521310|4.0|Another popular novel on the stands in time for the holiday shopping season by mega-writer David Baldacci. It will be popular, and it will sell. It's almost as if computers have decided all of this for us already. The novel feels a bit written by a computer, too, or should I just call it formulaic? There is certainly no aspiration to literature, which is where one has to keep the five star reviews, at least in my opinion. But, I did like the book, overlong and formulaic as it is. It entertained me, and I review it as such. Sure, it got a bit silly, was hugely incredible, and okay, you got me- it was predictable. But, all of those folks reading it already know that. It's just what passes the time when you are not watching a TV show, like say, King & Maxwell.
B00FAOV7FI|5.0|Great iPhone case. The case fits well and such a cool case. Much classier than normal rubber or plastic ones.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness may not be as witty and original as its predecessor, but it still brings a lot great memorable moments and of course -  it's action packed!  Overall the story is great and as well creative.  If you are a true Star Trek fan, you'll definitely dig this.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|I dont know because i cant even get it on my kindle fire.I dont actually hate it,I cant look at it to see if i like it.Also does the new kindle fire hdx 10.1'' support flash because if it does i am seriously thinking of getting one. please let me know otherwise i will probably buy one that does.Its a shame because i like my kindle fire. Best regards John.
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Author Luca Rossi knows how to hold you spellbound. I grew up reading science fiction but over the last twenty years focused mainly on non-fiction. Now I know what I have been missing. Rossi seamlessly blends humans, robots, mutants, vampires and more in worlds from the past, present and future to create the most original stories I have ever read. His book is a collection of short stories and you are sure to find a few favorites as I did. My three favorite stories were, &#34;Rewind,&#34; &#34;The Kingdom of Turlis,&#34; and &#34;Life in Prison.&#34; If you like science fiction and fantasy I highly recommend this book.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|The game sucks the sync takes forever to save your game and even then it doesn't work out has reset twice
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is a good DC game. If you like DC supper hero's, you would love this game. I know I do.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Just what I needed to remind me to pay my bills on time.  I can set it for a month in advance and be ready to mail out those checkd
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|I love this app so much. I have it on my mom's phone, my tablet, and my grandpa's iPad. It is so addicting! ;)
B00FF8OKJE|4.0|You have to be connected to the Internet to play which is not always possible for everyone.  You can get bored easily waiting for your items to be built or upgraded.  It is best to do as many actions as you can and then come back to it later.  The game consumes to much of your time and can real alter your lifestyle.  It would be a better game if you could be connected at intervals.  if things took a short amount of time to complete or you could raided castles and get gems than the games pace would be faster and play would be more exciting.  For example, a Level 1 creation could take 6-10 minutes of realtime to construct and a Level 3 could take 18- 30 minutes.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|this game is a lot of fun I love tcgs and this one has a great make your own deck and awesome heros
B00F0N7JUG|5.0|Greatest Movie EVER.  A great homage to japanese anime and movie with a American style.  Very rarely do the 2 blend together
B00CATSONE|4.0|A great story about a great man.  Able to create great inventions but not able to bring them to fruition.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game really makes you think. Sometimes I over think things.<br />I was really surprised at how difficult these seem, but are surprisingly simple love it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fun, engaging, challenging, different, great graphics, weird, original, slightly creepy. My 8-year-old neice liked it too! We finished it on Turkey Day together.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was not bad, but i loved first too books much more.<br />I didn't  like the change in a way of storytelling.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game and creators really hit the ball out if the park. the worst part is that u wont have enough time.to do all u want to
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is awesome. Totally worth 99 cents if you are a fan of strategy games. The goal is to infect the world with a deadly virus and eradicate all life before a cure is developed. Sounds horrible, I know, but after playing a game or two, you get used to it. As you play more you unlock new viruses and you have to be careful how you evolve your disease because the population will adapt to it. In spite of the morbid subject, I recommend this to any strategy fan.
B008MM9630|4.0|cool not a bad app fun to play when you have nothing to do could be a bit cheaper with the in app buys
B0091VYG86|4.0|Just a great show! I really enjoyed the black&white feel of the show and over all thoughts around colored individuals vs non-colored.  Makes you think a little!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great Movie, the animation is beautiful and the story is intense!  Very good movie, but might be too intense for real little ones or sensitive children.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great to play and super fun. I like the easy finger movements that allow you to move your minion around. Collecting bananas is also very easy if you just keep playing.
0374533555|5.0|Changes the way you think of the thinking process. Makes you more aware of own vulnerabilities. Don't be surprised if after the lecture watching advertising, analysing promotions, and listening to politicians makes you angry (....more than before). Applying this knowledge in practice could yield more self aware and better informed society (impact on mass media) but since it takes mental effort to apply, It will probably never have as much impact as it deserves to have. Using example studies the book also makes a witty and persuasive point in showing how much of an animal  resides inside humans that leaks trough in our instinctive reactions.
B00GINENG0|5.0|I think this a great app. It gives you a chance to billed Tom your way and not just the way he was created. Great job! Kudos!
B00902AKK4|5.0|This is a really cute little game my 6 yr old loves it and so do I , we got it free on app of the day but is worth the 1.22$ it's being sold for. It's challenging for a child makes them think about planning ahead and there are consequences if you don't and if you do get it wrong there's a,very handy re wind button , you need coordination to make the little fella jump and move. In summery a great game.
B00G8YDVZS|5.0|I have grown to love the show and all the drama. My only curiosity is....... Do lawyers have agents like Kalinda that research and are as brutal as she is?
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|Fun to play easy controls to master. Simply the best tablet racing game available. My only complaint is the lack of Mazda cars.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Another great story<br />Edgar is awesome<br />Very disappointed that TV show was cancelled.  It was a great complement to character development.
B00DYWKPAQ|3.0|1st 7 songs great, all the rest way below KOL standards.  I'm a great fan and a<br />I have very high expectations.  1st 5 CD's approached greatness.
1402547056|5.0|All of Alexander Mcall Smith's No. 1 ladies detective agency books are Great!!!  This one is probebly my favorite one.  It is so endearing and heart warming.  I have read or listened to all of his books.  Wonderful reading.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Love all the Vacation films.  This one is extra funny because it reminded me of my husband several years ago.
B009GIPDQS|1.0|Enjoyed it until last pages. Won't spoil it but the plan explanation just can't be possible. Key events couldn't have been known or predictable.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|boring book, tried the second to see if it improved and it did not - never read the third and do not intend to read it.
B00DJZR46G|1.0|Only one good song,  all the rest suck.  Don't know what E is thinking.  Very dull piano playing.  Needs to get back to his old self.
B000005RDY|5.0|An affordable and all too brief collection on an unheralded band. I came to BUDGIE, like most new fans thru METALLICA (thank you). Just ten songs. (I know, it's a budget release.) A great primer, and leaves you wanting for more. If you're thinking about buying this... do it. What a shame that their catalog is either out of print, too expensive, or both. Under any circumstance, they probably would have never become huge, but they held their own and made their mark. Get off the fence and buy it.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|The book is recommended to no one. I dearly wish I could recover the time wasted reading it. The central character never develops. The story, if there is one tediously drones to a stop with no discernible conclusion.
B00DMEQP46|5.0|While there music style has changed from Oracular Spectacular, they still maintain that wit about themselves with the lyrics and their imagination. I have very much enjoy listening to this album. Alien Days is by far my favorite track  but I Love You Too, Death is a poem of a song and I can't but like it just as much. I would say buy this album because there's no one else out there like MGMT.
B009CVRQLY|4.0|On Love Me Back To Life, we find Celine letting her hair down and enjoying herself on this record, experimenting with different beats and vocal styles. If you are expecting another cd with chess beating, soaring vocals and big hits like My Heart Will Go On, or It's All Coming Back To Me Now, you will be disappointed.<br />It is clear that Celine had decided to be more current and has taken a new direction with this cd, which I find to be refreshing, specially since I find it works well for her. Granted it took me two listening to get to the heart of this cd<br />There are 5 remakes on this cd, on which would appear to be all songs that Celine like very much and have done very personal interpretations of. Celine has a unique talent for finding the heart and soul of a song and bringing it to life.  The outstanding of the remakes are, Water and Flame originally done as a duet by Adele and Daniel Merriweather. Janis Ian &#34;At Seventeen&#34; seems to hold a special place for her in this sincere version and Billy Joel's Lullabye (Goodnight My Angel) found on the Deluxe edition, here Celine is able to give this song a very maternal and personal feeling to it. The other remakes include Overjoyed, a duet with Stevie Wonder and the RnB classic How Do You Keep The Music Playing, also found on the Deluxe edition.<br />The rest of the cd is all original music, each with something different to offer and at the same time showing a different side to Celine. Some of the highlights include the first track  Love Me Back To Life, with slight electronic and dupstep beats, to the up tempo Save Your Soul, where we find Celine doing a Nelly-Furtado-like impression to Thank You, written by Ne-Yo, here we find Celine laid back using her lower register while all the while showing gratitude for her many blessings.<br />My personal favourite is Didn't know Love produced by Eg White, sounding very vulnerable in a huskie voice.<br />This is a very different cd for Celine, but it works once youget beyond the usual expectations of a Celine Dion cd. If you are interested to hear her take on a different style this is the cd for you. If you are looking for the usual Celine of big dramatic hits with soaring vocals, this is not for you.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I have to defer to the grandkids and wife on this one. They LOVED it and can hardly wait to watch #2. They (me too) laughed through the entire movie. They laughed so much had to keep rewinding to get the punch lines.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is the best book I've read this year.  I place it in the top ten in the fiction category that I've ever read in my 72 years.  There are many reviews for the customer to check.  I just wanted to add my voice.  I'm Thankful on this day for the talent of John Grisham.
1608870081|5.0|Awesome Pop-up book for the price! Purchased as an Xmas gift along with another pop-up book, for my nephews. They absolutely loved it! Some of the pop-ups were extremely elaborate and well designed. I grew up loving these types of books and this is one of the best I've ever seen. Would recommend.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a great game. Good for stress relief. Plays good on the Kindle also.If you love to challenge your friends this is the game for you.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|good quality while streaming from Netflix and Youtube, but there are two few apps support chormecast now, and it doesn't work well with desktop chrome, which is quite disappointed. Still, $35 price tag makes it a very good buy.
B00F91G5BS|3.0|Not bad because of quality of acting but l'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the theatre I rented it on Amazon Prime.
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I see why AM is a nobel laureate. I chose this for my bookclub b/c I like to choose quality literature, of course, but also b/c my group has gotten a bit lax on completing full texts recently. Since I refuse to sacrifice quality for convenience, I chose Ms. Munro's recent/and last (?) publication, hoping to keep the integrity of book club's purpose intact as well as meeting readers' time constraints. The shorts provided more discussion than most of our lengthier picks--a testimony to Munro's craft. There is SO much to mine in these deceptively simple little stories of times gone by in places far away.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Most excellent. I can turn my classic Ipod into a Bluetooth sound source and play it through any Bluetooth speakers sans connecting cable. This makes for a lot less &#34;stuff&#34; around my desk at work. This L'ill fella is worth its weight in gold. It eliminates having to use a cable between my Ipod/Ipad to a bluetooth speaker. The range is good and the sound is great. Good onya Kokkia :)
B000XXGMRO|5.0|Great boot with nice leather and it fits me well. TImberland boot is always what I want. That's so comfort.
B003H4I4JU|2.0|Eh, the characters were just too emotionally weird for me. Novinha was just frustrating to read and the emotional goo that Card pours is just too thick. As I read it I thought to myself, &#34;Who acts this way?&#34; and &#34;Who puts up with that?&#34;. I finished it but I think I'm done with this series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love that I can set this to get gradually louder when I don't turn it off. Then it does not shock me awake in the morning. I set the alarm on my cell phone and use this on my kindle fire to be backup. I forget to charge one or the other many times. The only thing I would suggest for an update is that the screen is on sleep mode at night, and although the alarm goes off, it does not turn the Kindle on (off sleep mode) so I have to hit the power button, slide the &#34;turn on&#34; swipe, and then turn off the alarm. By the time one does all that, hitting the snooze is really not necessary. I am awake. But I do like it and especially like the many alarm sounds. And the blue of the &#34;ringing&#34; screen is so pretty. A nice first sight in the morning.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This book pulled me in immediately, and I had to discipline myself to avoid staying up too late trying to finish it.  It's long, but I read it with a kind of tense fascination, as one thing after another happens, and I just HAD to know what came next!  The writing is lush, very descriptive.
0761169253|5.0|This is fun to read and very practical. Everything is stolen as he says, with one's own twist. I liked it for light reading.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is great. It is very accurate, and continues to improve with each update. This app is worth downloading, and the free version is great. The only difference between the free and upgraded versions is disabled ads. I would highly recommend this app for your basic weather information.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|I have just installed office to my kindle and not really used enough..... looking through the program, I'm sure it is good. I will have to do another posting after I have used it more......
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|I cannot figure this out: the app tells me I should move an app to the memory card to save space. So it tells me to save space by clicking &#34;move to SD card&#34; but I click that on the original screen and the screen then moves to another screen and it says to click &#34;move to SD card&#34; but I cannot find that place to click!  Not a huge deal since I just cancel it, but I am curious where that button is!  All in all, it is an ok app and helps a bit.
B00622D3BS|5.0|great ending, love how it all just crashed together. This is an appropriate modern love story, and managed to dig a little deeper than superficial romantics
B00GX50BD2|5.0|I don't know why this movie received bad reviews initially. I thought Ashton Kutcher was great and casting him in this role made perfect sense. He's a guy that can clearly relate to Steve. The fact that they don't show the later years involving the iPod, iPhone, and iPhone made sense as well because most people already know that part. I did wonder why they neglected to show how Apple stole the mouse and UI from Xerox.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app, though I do wish there was an option to play spider solitaire. But over all a really great app.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! I think it is better than petshop story, restaurant story, etc. this TOTALLY helped me when I first started typing because you can visit other people.  I love this game!!!!!
B00005M1Y2|2.0|Since the DVD was made in England, and I wanted to play it in the US, my DVD player had to be multi-regional. And it's not. Apparently the comment section told me this prior to ordering. My fault. I can play it on my computer, and it is not cost effective to send it back so I will just chalk it down to experience.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Typical James Bond, and even more riveting......the James Bond series remains timeless, and moves into the future well equipped to hold our attention.

B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Atwood has always preferred to call her work speculative fiction rather than science fiction because she uses existing technologies and cultural trends as the raw materials from which to paint her fictional future.  And let's hope that Atwood's speculations are way off, because her imagined future is not only horrifying, it is less than 30 years away.  In terms of projecting possibilities, she's borrowing from Ray Kurzweil's math homework, but it's The End that's near, not The Singularity.<br /><br />Everything about MaddAddam, the immensely readable conclusion to the Oryx and Crake trilogy, is chillingly familiar.  The huge compounds of the fictional CorpseCorps bring to mind a certain place in Mountain View, California, where the most \\"successful, ubiquitous and strange\\" corporation of our time is employing its army of tech geniuses and bio wonks in an earnest attempt to mine data from every corner of human existence (starting from the genetic code) to \\"solve death.\\"  Let's hope Larry Page has more stringent bio-ethics than Crake, because there's more than one way to skin that particular cat as Atwood points out.<br /><br />As I read (no, devoured) the final instillation of Atwood's trilogy, I could not help thinking about how much the world has changed in the last decade, since Oryx and Crake was published in 2003.  In a less prescient author's hands, that futuristic book could seem antiquated in the span of 10 years.  (Let's try to remember 2003, that far away time before Facebook, smart phones, internet purchasing, YouTube, Global Outsourcing, wikipedia, networked gaming, Twitter, etc. etc. etc. were either nonexistent or emergent trends rather than ubiquitous, global realities of daily life.)  Instead, the future is shaping up pretty much the way she imagined in many respects.  Lab meat is real now; it's called Shmeat and was concocted in a Dutch lab this last summer.  The beepocalypse was featured on the cover of Time this year, so don't be surprised if her predictions about ultra-expensive fruit come true by 2024.  Let's not forget the whole NSA/Snowden bombshell that has exploded since back in '03 when she imagined a omnipotent government combining forces with an omniscient/omnipresent corporation to hack and mine information about its allies, enemies and citizens alike.  And then there's the recent revelations about the seedy, Tor-enabled underbelly of the internet, where child porn, illicit drugs, and hired assassins can be bought and payed for with cyber currency.  This is pretty much exactly the same dark-internet-alleys in which the adolescent Crake/Glenn and Snowman/Jimmy bonded over extreme porn and live suicide shows in 2003.  And that seemed so incredibly disturbing back in '03.  Now it just seems believable.  According to Attwood, in another decade it will seem quaint.<br /><br />My point is, Atwood's speculative fiction has managed, brilliantly and compellingly, to keep pace with a present reality that changes so fast that it feels like the future arrives now in a continuous live feed.  I wish there were going to be more novels like this from Atwood, and/or that someone with skill and respect purchases the film rights (and doesn't bastardize the hell out of it, a la Cloud Atlas), because it'd really be something to see the pigoons and rakunks and Crakers and all the other wonderful/horrible bits of her imagination up on the big screen.  I think we have the technology now to make it look believable.redictions about ultra-expensive fruit come true by 2024.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I don't believe that I will ever get tired of reading the works of Mr. John Grisham. And of course Sycamore Row grabs you like all the others. Spell bounding and mind boggling, at the end of each court session you feel like you are walking out of the Courthouse. A suggested read for all, a must for Grisham fans, enjoy.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I was the only person in the office on the afternoon of the day it was released in hardback, and when my boss called in, I asked if I could leave early.  He said I could, so about an hour later I took off and went to a local bookstore.<br /><br />There were other books I was interested in as well, so I took Heart of Obsidian and a couple of others and sat down to go through them.  I looked up three hours later and I had finished the book.  I bought it for my Kindle at the full initial price, and have gotten more than my money's worth.  I also just bought the paperback - I wasn't about to miss out on the deleted scenes.  I did buy the paperback at the store where I read the hardback in one sitting, but I am not about to feel guilty about it, for reasons that are obvious (at least to me).
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|Played better, played worse. If you paid more than .99 cents, you paid too much. Others have better controls. It is not bad, but there are others that deserve your money
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good story. Boring in parts. But John always gives you your moneys worth. Having read &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; is a must.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Yeah...everything is ok.  I didn't like the fact that it says in the beginning that it started in Taiwan.  Why it got to be from a Asian country?!  Also, I didn't like the end, where during one scene, a normal uninfected person attracted the undead and they released the DOG to go at them.  Why?!  WHY?!  WTF?!!  Think the dog is immune?  I just really hate that dog, the most loving is used as a weapon, tool, and whatever for the use of men.  Stupid.  that is why men, human being is destined to self destruct and perish.  No doubt about it.

B008JFUNHI|1.0|Don't believe the hype. This is not a good film. The acting, script, story, moral, action are all used up cliches and not even well done ones. This is NOT a classic. It must NOT survive the ages. I hope somewhere several people feel shame about getting away with making such a bland and awful film, but realistically they are just rolling around on a pile of money<br />Adieu
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is another well-written legal thriller from Grisham  which highlights many issues in relationships between blacks and whites in the South.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I don't know why I haven't posted this before now, but I've read this book at least 15 times. This book reminds me that passion is a fantastic thing that we as humans are capable of.<br /><br />After all, if an author can dream up this kind of intense love, it has to be real!
B00EEDNA4M|3.0|The show is great (in case you don't know by now) and this edition is really nice, great barrel prop and awesome magnet based storage system for the blu-rays. The case is sturdy and looks really good.<br />The delivery was really really fast, I'm impressed, it took only 2 days to get here in Italy from overseas, no issues at all with customs.<br /><br />However I have a major and a minor issue with this set.<br /><br />The major, annoying issue is the fact that this collection is NOT REGION FREE, despite it being advertised as being so.<br />I tried all the disks on my european PS3 and only the FIRST and FIFTH season disks are actually region free, the rest are REGION A coded, including the BONUS disk.<br />This is obviously a big letdown and a huge slip-up for Amazon, especially for a european customer like me who had to pay 100$ more for shipping and customs duties.<br />Things get even more annoying if you consider the fact that the UK earlier release of this product had ACTUAL REGION FREE DISKS, which is the reason why it's sold out and I had to get this version instead, spending A LOT MORE.<br /><br />The minor issue is the packaging.<br />It's really flimsy and sealed in such a way that's almost impossible to preserve for later use, not to mention it was completely wrecked during shipping.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|fun to play. cant stop playing it<br />. only problem is running out of energy and having to stop playing
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This is sad. Just bought the chromecast a day back for 35$ plus taxes and now its for 30$.. Y U DO THIS AMAZON
B00005N6KG|5.0|I used to buy this in sets of two, one to use and one to store.  My guess is that I've owned 10 pairs, possibly more.  They last about six months, give or take a month, which is fine given that they were about $10.  The price has shot up and now it would in fact be cheaper to buy the Sony S2 Sports Walkman and toss the Walkman part to get the headphones.<br /><br />Earbuds don't stay in for me, which is why I loved these.  They fit me perfectly and the sound was strong and sharp. When a speaker stopped working, which happens like clockwork after a few months, it was no big deal because of the cost.  I used them for running and the gym on an almost daily basis.<br /><br />Like a lot of other users, I'm in the hunt now for a replacement.  I just ordered the Philips Neckband headphones (about $30) and the Philips Actionfit SHQ5200 (over $100).  I hope I'll like one of these as much as I liked the lightweight Sony unit, which fit me so well.  Given the extra cost, I really hope I not only like them but they'll last at least two years.
0871404133|5.0|Great book.  Introduces a single, new, important, and fascinating idea that is both plausible and deeply thought-provoking: Hierarchical selection has led to genetically programmed behaviors that we regard as &#34;good&#34; (altruistic) being the result of group selection, and  &#34;bad&#34; (selfish) behaviors from individual-level selection.
B0093X80VQ|5.0|I knew that this book was actually the sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I HAD to read it first, though. It was calling my name so strongly, I just couldn't seem to keep myself from it. After reading a review expressing how weird this book was, I had *high* hopes for it! (Plus, I knew the story of Charlie's adventure at the Chocolate Factory from the movies, so I didn't feel like I'd be missing information.)I am always on the lookout for the next book to add to my &#34;wonderfully weird&#34; list of books/authors. It's such a small list, and they're my favorites!<br /><br /> I was not disappointed! At all! I can officially add this book to my &#34;wonderfully weird&#34; list, and that just makes me happy. :D<br /><br /> I couldn't stop smiling while reading, except when I was laughing. I have somewhat of a childish sense of humor. I also find dry humor exceptionally funny. Roald seems to mix the two beautifully.<br /><br /> *I should clarify on the child humor. I despise the tendency to resort to such things as boogers and poo and talking dead rats(talking to you, Wayside Stories!)and such in an effort to make a child laugh. Those things lose me quick! (That said, I'm a mommy of 3 little boys. There's always stories of &#34;poo&#34; that I'll look back on with humor.) ;) Roald seems to avoid the &#34;bodily humor&#34; that I hate(at least in the 3 books I've read), which I greatly appreciate. Even so, he's still hilarious, and I think children will find his writing especially appealing.<br /><br />Probably the only thing that bugged me about these books is the fact of the age contradictions. In Chocolate Factory, the grandparents are well over 90 years old. In this book, they range in age from 78-81(except Grandpa Joe, whose age wasn't given that I noticed). It drove me a little crazy that they were younger starting out in the sequel.<br /><br /> My cousin asked recently for something to cheer her up, and I had to recommend this book. It IS simply ridiculous! Absolute nonsense! I'll do the same for you. Do you need a little cheering up? Read this book!<br /><br /> But!<br /><br /> As you read it, it's important to keep in mind the words of Mr. Willy Wonka(Roald Dahl).<br /><br /> &#34;A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men.&#34;ous!

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Classic Grisham. Fast pace and great characters. Lucian and Harry Rex are flawed and brilliant. He writes about race respectfully, and not as if it is an elephant in the room. Great read.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Common sense advise from someone who knows.  Stop sabotaging your health with bad food choices and allow your body and brain to function properly.  Practical and easy to follow steps.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This game is fun, i will tell you that. But its pretty frustrating because it often glitches out on me. Like when I close the app, sometimes it still plays the music. (And it gets pretty annoying) And when I went to the main menu, the purple guy with the balloon and is chopped in half, he was glitching and he turned into a giant sqaure-looking figure and it took up three fourths of the screen. So the game is fun and all but beware of glitches!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enter the game at the first floor of a building with a locked elevator door. You work out puzzles of low difficulty, but which can vary in complexity,  to find one or more keys to open the elevator and move to another floor.<br /><br />It's a room escape puzzle game with good graphics that provides a decent challenge for the average player. It keeps you engaged enough to want to continue playing floor after floor, and lacks huge leaps of &quot;sneaky trick logic&quot; that some games of room escapes seem to lean on.<br /><br />Unfortunately, so far it's only ten floors.There is a promise of more coming, but no idea when that will come. As the floors go up, they could stand to increase the complexity or difficulty gradually.<br /><br />So far, it's been an amusing distraction while sitting in doctor's waiting rooms.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Highly recommend !So fun to play. Can be eastyand challenging at the same time !Have fun with it . If you like puzzle games you will really like this game
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Not the same great formula of the other 2 movies, but still entertaining if you enjoy the characters. Worth a watch.
B00F8GYC1Y|3.0|While this game does allow you to experience new birds and (theoretically) new environments from the prequel series the game just fails to impress. The gameplay is exactly the same is in previous birds games, must of the new birds need to be bought either in packs (which only allow limited uses) or singularly. The level design is also relatively sub-par when compared to other installments. Not only that but the game doesn't even have anything past Tatooine in Episode 1. Nothing from Clone Wars, and nothing from Revenge of the Sith. I'm actually disappointed with Rovio in this aspect. It's almost as if they sold an incomplete game with little desire for improvement.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Really enjoyed all three books!! Bit of a downer at the end, but totally believable and I still loved it. Recommended!!
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I'm 68% into the book and bored, bored, bored.  I have to agree with another review I read, it's time for Kay Scarpetta to retire - along with her creator, Patricia Cornwell.  I've been increasingly disapointed with her books for awhile now and this one has just sealed it - I'm not buying any more of her books.  I will finish &#34;Dust,&#34; just because I spent (wasted) good money on it.  Cornwell has failed to bring any of her characters &#34;alive&#34; in this one - it's like a narration with no direct knowledge of the people involved.  Also, she has painted everyone in a negative fashion in this book - doesn't show any good in any characters so far (at least 68% into the book anyway).  This book falls flat, just like a day old soda.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Really like the story about these two love birds.  Too much explicit sex though, my friends and I all agree, no young newly in love couple can keep it up this much.  I get it, they are nymphomaniacs, but I keep reading because I really want to know where their lives are going.  I'm almost done and do want to finish, but have had enough of the explicit sex by the middle of book two.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Love this movie.  My other DVD wore out and I was having a hard time finding a replacement.  Very entertaining for kids and adults.  Nice packaging and it came in on time.
B00E5N8DGG|5.0|This is a must have for any fan of the band. The audio and video quality sets the bar for any other live concert recording. The band performs their most successful album &#34;hysteria&#34; in order and in its entirety. To my surprise they also played songs I've never seen them do from their first record &#34;on through the night&#34; ,as well as the entire first side of &#34;High n Dry&#34;. The band plays homage to late guitarist Steve Clark, and prove some things just keep getting better with age. Anyone who remotely likes this band will enjoy this. Five stars!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the best stories that I've read in a while.  It's intelligent, funny, and poignant.  It's from the point of view of a teenager but very relevant to us adults too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't wait to begin the 2nd book to find out where these two love birds were going with their lives.  A bit less explicit sex would be okay though.
B00DXPC1U6|5.0|The Eigth season of Dexter is an appropriate continuation of the show. Many people seem to dislike if because it's more serious tone and it's thematic deconstruction of Dexter's character. Unlike the vigilante-feeling of especially the first 2 seasons the end of the show focuses on the fallout, the consequences of what Dexter is. The final episode exacerbates this and was criticised heavily for it. While I agree that the finale was not perfect, I believe that not giving the show a happy end was quite fitting and that the viewers should indeed have to experience along with Dexter that his actions would have consequences.<br />Ending a show like Dexter is an almost impossible job, I feel the writers have pulled it off quite well and I can't understand all the negativity about this final season and it's finale at all. Calling the final season unbalanced and some of the twists illogical is preposterous considering what has happened in the previous seasons already, that this show is not too realistic should be clear to any fan by now. All in all, I love this show and feel it ended fittingly with the final season no matter what all these self appointed internet critics have to say.
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's a fun time killer! Have really enjoyed playing. Love the simple concept of it. Worth getting. My husband even loves to play this game.

B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The chromecast is not a bad device for the price, but when it cant perform as advertised, it becomes a disappointment not a waste of money to me. I would say it works 80% of the time, breaks connection a lot even though the router is 10 feet away, freezes and cant keep up if casting a google chrome tab. I know that last one is experimental, but it worked fine for the first month, now it stops to the point where you cant cast more than 5 minutes. Good to get this off my chest, I hope the next device fixes this silly connection problems. One more thing, google needs to let this thing lose, stop holding its power back.

0765338149|4.0|I wanted to reread this before the movie came out to refresh myself on the details. It seems 20 years makes a difference in a person's perspective :-)<br /><br />I've always enjoyed stories that have a underdog that ultimately overcomes the forces aligned against him or her. However, in my second read of this book I noticed some literary shortcuts and subplots that seemed a bit contrived for a novel that has received such acclaim. A few of the &#34;mysteries&#34; in the story were altogether too conveniently resolved as were some of the challenges. The thing that bugs me the most about the story is the big deal made about the unique mindset of the gifted children and how it was required in order to defeat the enemy aliens. Frankly, the strategy and tactics displayed by the child prodigies were pretty ho-hum. If you've read any military history at all what was put forth in this book is a disappointment.<br /><br />Good thing those kind of details were not essential to make this a decent book.

1608199096|5.0|Beautiful book. I've just fell in love with the cover, materials and that naked spine!!!! Very very classy.<br />When you open it, quotes a sing on the door of a venetian Osteria: &#34;No Pizza. No Lasagne. No Directions.&#34;... That tells you that what you have in your hands is a different italian cookbook. Great cichèti (venetian snacks), fish, bread, meats, etc recipes, pictures and histories behind signature dishes. Immediately brings me back to Venice!<br />I'm a professional cook as well a book collector and definitely this is one of my favs.<br />Two thumbs up to Russell Norman, Jenny Zarins and Bloomsbury Publishing.
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|Entertaining. Fairly well written, predictable story lines.  Acting is decent. Characters are relatively well developed. Worth watching if you have nothing else to do.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|It's just a good game. I enjoy playing it. That's all there is to say. except  that I think you will enjoy it  too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its really good nice graphics  and a variety  of horses.over all really really good game totally  recommend it to horse lovers.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I reluctantly put this on my Android tablet - mostly because ebay is way better than Amazon when you are trying to find used/refurbished, high quality IT equipment.  I figured it would be a waste of time considering how painful it is to use the Amazon store app.  What a shock though.  This app does everything right.  It makes searching through a pile of hits easy to refine.  Amazon's app is terrible at this.  I shop in the Amazon app only if I'd rather not go power up my computer, and usually regret actually trying to research what to get in the Amazon app.  Not so with the ebay app.  I daresay it is as powerful and easy to use as the web interface you use when you're on your computer.  I'm not sure, but the app might even be better.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|One of the best Superman movies ever.  It was downright epic!!!  Full of action and adventure, awesome visual effects, and more!  A must see!!
0061950726|5.0|The author created a wonderful read.  Although the main characters are generations apart--they eventually transcend both age and economic differences. Each of them experienced an early loss of love and parenting.  Baker Kline makes us care and the characters' stories resonate with the reader. The book is ultimately a love story.<br /><br />Her extensive research was one of the primary reason I bought the book.  Little is known or written about this period of time when orphaned children were put on a train to be &#34;adopted&#34; by anyone for whatever purpose. My uncle came into WI. on an &#34;Orphan Train.&#34; He was one of the few fortunate ones.  A big family had room for one more--and he was loved!<br /><br />Baker Kline writes a compelling, little known, piece of history with a style that keeps a reader engrossed.  I'll definitely look forward to more of her books.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great story line... again.  If you haven't watched the first series, do so, it enhances this season. It keeps you interested.
B002X3V4P2|4.0|What can I say?  I like Enya.  I have a number of her older CD's.  I doubt I could dislike her music.  That said, I can't say that I find this particularly compelling.  It doesn't really stand out to me as being something I just have to have.
1476712042|1.0|I really struggled with the rating for this book. At first I really loved it. It was a cute bet and I loved Abby's resilience to stay away. But the further in the book I made it the more annoyed I was.<br /><br />Near the end I was ready for it be over. The book was still good enough for me to read well into the a.m. But I found myself skipping over paragraphs.<br /><br />Abby and America are two childhood friends who leave Kansas to start fresh. Abby had a rough childhood and didn't want people to see her as her father's child.<br /><br />Travis is a rough-cut boy who fights in floating fight rings and is known for his one night stand reputation. He tricks Abby into a bet that has her living at his apartment for a month.<br /><br />As the story progresses, nearing towards the end, it's obvious they have a very destructive unhealthy relationship. This is where it lost a star for me.<br /><br />I got tired of reading about them being miserable apart but Abby couldn't handle how similar Travis was to her dad and the life she left.<br /><br />Travis, when Abby leaves him, is border on psychopath. It's not even sweet or endearing how he pursues her, it's stalker like.<br /><br />I loved his character at the beginning of the book but he lost all my respect at the end. Even Abby had me wanting to pull my hair out, although I did applaud her.<br /><br />She noticed the signs of her father starting to show in Travis and got out fast. Kudos. Obviously she goes back to him but, whatever.<br /><br />I was going to say how the author created such a destructive relationship for them but I think she knew because every character told the main couple how insane they were. They pointed out all the signs of an emotionally abusive relationship.<br /><br />There's lots of drinking, smoking, cussing, sex, and complete lack of morality.<br /><br />As for everything else in the book, I liked it (except for all the random sex). Bleh.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think that the little minions are so adorable! Everyone has to love the minions! Great app it's cute funny and so much fun!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really enjoy this game, but what a disappointment to have the waiting intervals when you lose your five lives. Really, that's absurd! I play another game instead that doesn't have this frustration.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|The actors are fantastic, the story line is nicely done, and the soundtrack by Howard is awesome!  Great new director!
B00005JSGK|3.0|Love the movie but it will not play on newer DVD player. Good picture and sound on such a old movie.
B002RI9XOW|4.0|Rob Fleming is a thirty something London record store owner who has just lost his girlfriend Laura. Rob recalls his five most memorable break ups and then proceeds to get in touch with these girls in order to find out why they all ended up leaving him. Over at Championship Vinyl, Rob and his employees Dick and Barry spend their time demonstrating their vast music knowledge and constructing top five lists for every situation imaginable.<br /><br />I really loved the movie High Fidelity, one of my favourites for a long time. So I’ve always meant to read the book and I finally got myself a copy. I devoured the book, faster than I expected. The book and the movie are very similar with not many noticeable differences, I was really happy about that. Problem with seeing the movie first is the fact that I keep picturing John Cusack, Iben Hjejle and every character. The only character I couldn’t remember was Ian and I imagined Peter Serafinowicz instead of Tim Robbins.<br /><br />The only Nick Hornby movie I’ve read prior to High Fidelity was Juliet, Naked and I really didn’t get on to well with it. I was worried that I might have similar problems with this novel. Likely everything think I loved about the movie, comes from the book. The quirky nature, the themes and all those top five lists. Makes me want to watch the movie all over again. Weird but I prefer the movie, John Cusack is a great actor and I think it works better with the aid of audio and visual stimulation.<br /><br />The thing I loved High Fidelity is the whole self-discovery plot. Rob Fleming begins the novel telling us about his top five breakups and how Laura didn’t hurt him as much as the others. This leads him to contact these five women and find out why everyone leaves him. What he discovered was the opposite and he learns more about himself than expected. The novel ends with not happiness but a deeper understanding of himself and what he must do to achieve a better life.<br /><br />His love is so centred around his passion for music; he has to learn how to balance his life better. For music lovers, especially those who have an understanding in 80’s and 90’s music should appreciate this novel. For a romantic comedy, Hornby has this unique way of taking the genre that’s demographic is women and writing it with the male reader in mind.<br /><br />If you liked the movie, then I’m not sure you really need to read the book. If you loved it, like I did then why not experience it in its original format (it’s like the Vinyl vs. CD debate). While it is very similar to the movie it was an enjoyable experience, one I would repeat sometime. It is a short novel so there is no real reason not to read it, except the movie is less time consuming.so centred around his passion for music; he has to learn how to balance his life better.

B00123MBQA|2.0|Very disappointed in that the heading had original recording reissued. It is very much NOT. Very sneaky, misleading and underhanded.
B001NESPHC|4.0|Melody Gardot has a great voice and I love many of the songs. She has a sound - either you like it or you don't.  I am not crazy about the production.  Slick - lots of orchestration - I like my Blues and Jazz a little earthier, a little more club-like.  Go for it though - it is worth it for whatever reason prompted you to investigate.  Mine was a cut I heard on a jazz station.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Love this author...puts her story together really well. Characters are well thought out.<br />Plot is very good.<br />Read all of her novels.....waiting for the next one
B00BAXFAJC|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but found it at times far too wordy with some of the descriptions, which took away from the great story and plot. I enjoy long reads, but this was frustrating at times.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! I hope more companies adopt this type of work style. As an independent designer I know is possible to deliver quality work from anywhere in the world you are. Great book!
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|I think that this game is awesome you know what I'm saying man. It's kind help full when it comes to real life racing. Phsyc to the second sentence. The game is fun and it rocks and rolls.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app cuz I love horse's they r my favorite animal n just playing this app makes me feel like I'm riding n taking care of my own horse
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I enjoyed tremendously The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.  So, I am sorry to say that I found the writing of this book very disjointed and a disappointment.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Good story with imagination and 80s memorabilia thrown in. Good moral message at the end as well. Made me want to play Pac-Man again.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Useful information. I think I will choose myself from now on.  I have already used one of his techniques. Thanks for writing this book.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Incredible music. This has become my favorite album ever, and I'm 66-yrs old. Very musical with older German styles represented by the electric keyboard and background Opera style singer. Helps if you are fluent in German but is not required to enjoy the fit between vocals and instruments.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Love it. Great movie. Even better on Blu-Ray. Nolan's Batman series is exactly what the series needed. Way better than Burton or Shumacher's Batman.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Great game to play and enjoy, it really resembles the old Mario game. The only problem is sometimes freezes in the middle of game and you need to restart it in order to keep playing. It can be a little annoying and that's the reason I gave it four starts.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|This movie is amazing. The story of whales like Tilikum is heartbreaking. To see what happens to get them into captivity will make anyone tear up. They are extremely smart and have a brain eight times bigger than ours. I have never been to SeaWorld and I won't ever go there. The point of view was from the trainers at SeaWorld who genuinely care about the animals but weren't told everything about the animals they were caring for. A lot of people say it's biased, well SeaWorld didn't want to participate at all to defend themselves. I seriously hate them for blaming Dawn, she can't defend herself. If I went through what Tilikum went through I would be aggravated too. They don't belong in captivity.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game! I can't stop playing it is seriously addictive and you don't have to pay out of your own pocket to get somewhere
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Love it. Great movie. Even better on Blu-Ray. Nolan's Batman series is exactly what the series needed. Way better than Burton or Shumacher's Batman.
0062107313|4.0|This novel was well done and thorough. I read through the book quickly. It had my attention the whole time. Tan covered a lot of ground (years and relationships). I wished, at times, she stayed focused longer on a particular time and relationship. I would have liked to know more about Violet's relationship with her first husband. I felt that thread came and went too quickly. Overall, a solid read.
B000A0GXGA|5.0|This is a teaser dvd put out by Warner Bros on this seriesbut definitely great episodes to own.  Jame Garner is great as Bret Maverick.  If you do not want to own the whole series this is a good one to own.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love this game the Warner bros are always at their fullest when it comes to this I love what they do and I hope we can keep theirs dreams high as we always did with them
B007K3JCAE|5.0|Awesome movie. R.D.Jr's portrayal of Sherlock is great. If you enjoyed the first film, this one is just as good, if not better. Great on blu-ray.

B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Another crime, another dead body, another mystery for forensic pathologist, her niece and husband to solve.<br /><br />Ms. Cornwell hits another out of the park, with all the power of a seasoned and skilled story teller.<br /><br />I'm glad to see Lucy play a larger role in Dust. I have often thought that the author relates to her on a personal level, so it's good to see her take a more prominent place in this story. Go get em Lucy.
B00FPH6A70|4.0|The Conjuring is *still* freaking me out!  Any film that reminds me of the Amityville Horror is bound to win me over in a HUGE way.  What the Conjuring does remarkably well is allow time to develop not only a story, but atmosphere and horror.  These are crucial details when it comes to horror films.  You can't just throw a bunch of children and teenage daughters together (5 of them to be exact) with a mom/dad and assume we'll all instantly attach/care about them.  You have to allow these characters to develop an identity which is what makes the Conjuring one of the better horror movies out there.  Certainly one of the best released in recent years.  Every one of the family members is given time to shine.<br /><br />Actually what this movie does that the Amityville Horror does not (at least the original) is include moments of mystery in the storytelling.  It's not always 100% horror and scares.  Eventually the tone shifts in another direction which, in my opinion, is comparable to a mystery film.  With that said, the movie is most certainly a horror movie. The tone just sometimes goes in another direction perhaps unintentionally so to give viewers time to catch their breath.<br /><br />Anyway the scares begin on a subtle and somewhat harmless note- the family experiences the occasional creeps of closet doors opening and crawling sounds/noises throughout the house, but soon other more serious things begin to happen.  Pictures slam off the walls, birds crash through the windows, visions of a hanging take place outside by a tree branch, bed sheets fly off the clothesline and form a human figure before oddly landing flat against the upstairs window playing with our imaginations since we're not entirely sure a thunderstorm is causing this to happen (one of my personal favorite moments), a young daughter wakes up crying because she believes someone is standing by her bedroom doorway which causes her sister to wake up and question her (second favorite moment) and well, thelist goes on and on.<br /><br />No, the Conjuring isn't as scary as the Amityville Horror.  It comes close on a few occasions, however.  It's absolutely delightful to watch and hear this movie on a DVD player with powerful speakers too.  Yes the film relies heavily on jump scares, but it also includes a remarkable amount of suspense and atmosphere.  The only reason I'm not giving the movie 5 stars is for a couple reasons.  One, the Exorcist portion of the film, though awesome and atmospheric, is somewhat generically written.  And well, the storyline overall is somewhat predictable of a haunted house with typical tendencies and the occasional cliches coming in now and then.  Otherwise, worth watching.<br /><br />I do think there's one storyline flaw.  The mom/dad tell a visiting paranormal group that the entire family has to live downstairs in the living room because it's their only safe spot, however eventually the daughters go back to their bedrooms which is when the situation gets much worse.  I have a feeling the parents regret allowing their kids to return to their own rooms.  I think the basement and for that matter the entire house (due to the peeled brown wallpaper which was popular in the 70's I know) look believably creepy as well.  Great movie.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love the game but when I update the game sometimes my lives disappear. And I can't receive extra moves.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|If you've read the other books then this is a must read. Sadly much of the action is the same as the preceding book but from a different perspective so you spend 100s of pages saying to yourself &#34;but we already know this.&#34;  Still it's a good read and I CAN'T WAIT for the next book. It's just not as good as its predecessors.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I find it very repetitive, but my grandchildren enjoy it. Get very annoyed with all these games wanting you to spend money on tokens, jewels or whatever you win during the game. Quite a scam. Make sure grandkids can't accidentally spend your money with all the popups selling something.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Simple, fun and worth it. Fun for all ages. Decent graphics. Kids got me hooked. Don't like having to buy coins, but don't have to to play.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Changes the way you appreciate life, this is not a self-development book, but the insights are so provocative, that you would wake up for a new life! Must read for anyone who is ambitious! Well researched.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I love this game. A free version of Angry Birds Star Wars are you kidding that is like the most awesome thing ever.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Even though this is a memoir, it is told from the author's younger perspective. Plotted over several years but you can easily follow the time progression. Uses humor and satire throughout so you never feel fully depressed by any of the scenes. Told with great confidence and written wittingly. Overall great read, for school and personal enjoyment!
B00FHB7398|5.0|Just finished Web of Deceit: Black Widow Collector`s Edition (Full), and I am now fully addicted to Big Fish games. The story, the graphics, the music.......I do not know how they can provide so much entertainment for the price they charge. I particularly enjoyed the movie &quot;shorts&quot; and the way the actors interacted with the story.  The puzzles were unique and challenging, and the hidden object scenes required some effort but did not become frustrating. Bravo, Big Fish, and keep them coming!
B0026NZR98|1.0|I like the movie but it stopped and started randomly during Instant Video play. I have an HP laptop (G60) running Windows 8.1 Pro with Windows Media Center. I thought Microsoft had it right because Instant Video works perfectly on my HP desktop computer running Windows Vista.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I haven't actually played this game so I'm not really sure whether I like it or not. I will say this though my nephews seem to love it.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Well, I wasn't sure what to expect from this quick read and I'm please to report it was great! It touched upon several innovators of our time and some interesting perspectives of innovation and imagination. The section on Tesla, about 50% of the book, as spark an interest in me to learn more of this exceptional engineer. The author writes clearly and concisely and I highly recommend you read this and other books recommened.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Believable characters that make you laugh, cry, and fall in love.<br />Three stars for a review process that requires a min. word count.
B0094LU9C0|4.0|My 8 year old granddaughter has watched this moved over and over on my Kindle Fire HDX  The picture is very clear.  Very entertaining, good story line and a great way to teach compare/contrast with the book.

B00B5HQLMI|3.0|mostly a killing - destruction spree- not really in the same vein as the older James Bond movies.  This James Bond movie makes him look weak and more vengeful than more of an agent -reprehensive of England's police force.  More destruction due to bad driving than being a great chase scene.  Entertaining but no Goldfinger.......<br />Theme song - sounded like it should=James Bond
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A fascinating look at the other major players and string pullers, giving me more understanding of why Lincoln did certain things, and why he did not do others. I only wish I could have lived then.
B001I45UFC|4.0|Five star rating<br />I recommend this book for people who like the HARRY POTTER<br />series, the Percy Jackson series, the kingdom keepers series,and the Kane chronicles or the Clarice bean series<br />I enjoyed this book very much<br />This book is magical and has excitement on every page<br />I hope anyone else who reads this book enjoys it I did!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was 14 years old when this happened and it affected most of my life.  I often wondered if you could go back in time and change that awful day and Stephen King was the right person to take us on this journey.  Absolutely the best novel I've read in a long time.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Who would not love this series and without the commercials.  Great TV series.  No commercials makes this well worth the money and you get to watch it when you want to on your time

B0097EWK3A|4.0|One of the better hidden object games I've played. Like the fact that it had a little more spookiness to it than most games of this nature. I recommend it for any one who likes hidden object games.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse works great. I looked for a long time for a mouse that was reasonably priced and that worked great. This does. That's why it has so many awesome reviews. If you like palm style mouse set ups and many customization features this is good. I like it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was an exceptional read...story line woven seamlessly. I found it difficult to put the book down. Kudos to the writer!!!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Beyond Bridalveil Fall (Dwellers of Ahwahnee) by Sheryl Seal is one of those books that just gets you by surprise. The more I read the more I wanted to learn more about the characters and found myself guessing the ending differently a dozen times! The author does an EXCELLENT job depicting each character. Telling you just enough about them to draw you in but still leaving plenty of room to slowly but surely learn more throughout the story. Think if it like unravelling a ball of yarn. Seal holds the ball of information complete and slowly unwinds it evenly in this book!<br /><br />Aponi, Oria, Grey Wolf, Red Thunder, Grandfather, Grandmother and Yori are all loved or hated for various reasons. Oria is the &#34;Golden Queen of Ahwahneechees,&#34; with special mind-reading powers and the ability to see visions and inter-relate with the spirit world. Her tribe looks to her for leadership, guidance and power to beat the evil energy (Yori) around them simply by using more positive. Oria was in love with Grey Wolf and up until the very end the author did a great job of keep the ending of the book secret. I never would have guessed but will say I was VERY happy. I LOVE happy endings.<br /><br />Bottom line is Seal is an excellent writer and I can't wait for the next book to come out in the summer. I recommend you read this book and let the author know your thoughts. BRAVO Seal!

B00E8B1P9M|5.0|When my son was young, he would watch G.I. Joe all the time. However, I wanted to see this movie and I loved it. It was filled with action and if you like action, you will love G.I. Joe.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Wonderful movie - always makes me laugh.Wonderful parody of Star Trek The Original Series and all of its campy glory.
B006QV30JU|5.0|Classic and music is heavenly, especially if you are a romantic! Gene Kelly is dreamy.  Dancing is especially fun to watch!
B005MMY9A8|1.0|This is an action movie with very little sense of story.  I saw 3/4 of the movie and could take no more.  The picture is not worth seeing.
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|This is a great funny/serious movie and I recommend it. In my opinion it is equally as nice as RED the first movie.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first Fifty Shades was really hard to put down and Darker was still novel and held my interest, but Freed was, &#34;Good grief, how many times can you be that turned on,&#34; even though Christian never does disappoint and I wanted to find out what made him like he was.  I do think it might be one of the few series that I might possibly re-read.  Guess that is a pretty rave review when you think of it.  Still the third one was disappointing.  They all should be required reading as a couple before you get married.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great puzzler. Love the added achievements like jewels. Now I have an incentive to replay the game!
B00G32VYDG|4.0|This is a fun movie, irreverent regarding death and the hereafter.  The characters work well together and it makes the movie more fun.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|I watched this movie at least for times. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Wow! it was great and I would recommend it for everyone who likes action to see this movies.
B001B3MCQK|4.0|Where was this artist when I was looking for more of his work?<br />Not the best quality by today's standards, but good album; good artist<br />I understand from Finding Sugar-Man documentary that Rodriquez did not receive most of his fees as artist and songwriter; especially from South Africa and Australian record company<br />That's a shame!
B00B0TO00Q|5.0|Fantastic show, even if it is a soap opera.  Wonderful characters and writing.  Only wish Amazon Prime would get their downloading smoothed out.  It used to run well.  Now it comes in fits and starts.  Makes it a pain to watch anything.  Please fix this problem.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Brought the Google Chromecast to provide us the option to watch streaming movies/shows without having to install a DVR. Still learning all the capabilities and options available to us.
B00GCE3TCE|4.0|It has been too long since I've found a book such as this whose characters linger with me even after the last page is read. Even more impressive is that my middle school students recommended this book to me. We had just finished a Holocaust unit just before the movie premiered, so the suggestion was a natural next step. I loved the author' s surprising figurative language and use of first-person narrator.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|With over six thousand reviews, I know I'm not going to be saying anything new or clever here. Heck, I rarely bother writing reviews on the books I read.<br />However, I just had to say something about how much I loved The Fault in Our Stars. I was hooked from the very first page and didn't want to put it down. I read it in the car during my lunch breaks. I read it at home and made my husband wonder why I was ignoring him. The last time I read a book so voraciously was Deathly Hallows (six years ago!), and that was also the last time I felt a real emotional connection to literary characters and what happens to them. I laughed with them, I cried with them (like the soon-to-be 30 year old baby that I am) and when the book ended, it left me wanting more. John Green is really a master of his craft.<br />If you are reading this review and trying to decide whether or not to buy this book...don't think. Just read it. You won't be disappointed.

140006922X|4.0|Zealot is an interesting title for this book because, according to the author's research, Jesus was not part of the Zealot movement. But Jesus was a revolutionary, and what little information we have about him from his own time contradicts the modern image of the Good Shepherd who is focused on peace on earth.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book -- it's well-written and answers what questions it can about the historical Jesus. Readers looking for a definitive portrait of Jesus may not find as much information as they'd like in this book, but the fact is that there are only a very few references to him from his time other than in the Bible. Aslan notes that the four Gospels were written decades after the crucifixion, and researchers aren't sure who the actual authors were.<br /><br />Aslan was raised in Iran and his family fled the country during the revolution in the late 1970s. He briefly became a Christian in his youth but eventually moved away from that. I didn't pick up on any religious bias in this book, which he calls the result of two decades of research. He delves into the historical period in which Jesus and his followers lived and the early years of what came to be known as the Christian Church, including disputes between followers who kept the Jewish laws and the<br />Gentiles who did not. There's a major focus on Paul's teachings, and how they got him in hot water with Jesus' brothers.<br /><br />This book is interesting and thought-provoking. Just don't expect it to answer all of your questions.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|True story about our brave men who gave their all for our country but how have we paid them back, like breaking treaties and treating them like a foreign citizen. In your eyes when you look at them what comes to your mind? Shame on us all !!

B001ANYDAO|5.0|Gladwell does it again, only this time he lays the foundation for understanding why certain people achieve more in life than others that may have had similar circumstances.  His stories and data energize thoughts that make you wonder about your own upbringing and that of your children.  He offers suggestions on how we can improve our progeny and grant them the opportunities needed to become the stuff of this book -- an outlier.  Highly recommend this fun and thought-provoking book!

B00F30S0Y0|4.0|Very good album.  Different than their earlier work but still as compelling.  Most songs are strong although a couple fall flat.  Overall a great listen.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Literate and Dickensian. Fully enjoyable book character driven with the plot elements following the characters instead of the characters following the plot. An absolute joy to read.

B004HXIZVC|5.0|I found so many of my favorite bands on SounCloud,Pink Floyd is one of my favorites and I get to share my thoughts!
B00FN3HRG4|5.0|Barbra is always a class act. This concert was engaging, and compelling, and fun. So much talent, and entertainment in one concert.<br />Barbra had several guests including her son Jason, who has a voice as good as Josh Groben, and Michael Buble.<br />The selection of songs were great,  just enough new songs, and not as many \\"Greatest hits.\\"  Also noticed that Barbra had a few Mash-Ups.<br />When you think about the price for a concert video, let alone one with a CD, and under $20, you say that is a real value.  I am so impressed that Barbra has released this at such a price point.<br />The DVD video is so well done, I kept on looking at the case making sure that it wasn't Blu-Ray. (Sure do hope she releases it on BD)<br />But I haven't loved a Barbra concert this much since Arrowpond.
B000002IM7|4.0|this album has songs that are<br />so fully formed its hard to believe<br />its a debut.<br />i love it, but out of the big five<br />its my least fave over all,<br />because its not mixed that well<br />(where's Dug's bass?\\"..and justice for all syndrome\\" of late 80's<br />heavy or power metal where its basically drums,<br />two panned guitars and vocals)<br />and some of the songs arent as consistently<br />good as on the next 4.<br /><br />normally i dont do this but song by song:<br /><br />in the new age- (10/10) soo epic. the beginning of kings x. next..<br /><br />goldilox- (10/10) a fan fave to this day; they re-did it on ogre tones<br />and both versions are really good.<br /><br />power of love-(7/10) so professional, tight harmonies, like a gospel hymnal..<br />for me though after hearing it a hundred times i can skip it occasionally.<br /><br />wonder-(10/10) a little proggy here and there, poignant harmonies.<br /><br />sometimes-(10/10) im not exactly christian, but when i hear the chorus<br />\\"..i stand here praying for new jerusalem..\\" it gives me chills.<br />how to write an incredible chorus 101 for those looking to learn! :)<br /><br />king-(6/10) this one i skip more than most..its got a cool feel and groove<br />but by this point of the album im getting a little tired of the key of D..<br />even so, i appreciate the hard work they put into it.<br /><br />what is this?-(9/10) i wish i had a version of this song without the chorus..<br />i love the proggy breakdown and weird harmonies in the rest of the song.<br /><br />far, far away-(10/10) this song i love..its so well done and so unique..love it.<br /><br />shot of love-(5/10) too \\"secular-ly annoying..?\\"..i know the guys were coming from that world and all<br />but i dont like the feel of this song..i skip it. for a great spiritual song consult \\"sometimes.\\"<br /><br />visions-(10/10) what a great powerful epic song! on youtube theres at least one version of this<br />song live where the band is tuned down to C that i love..<br />also, its just amazing to hear how good the band sounds live.<br /><br />in short, one of the best \\"gospel metal\\" albums ever,<br />certainly the best gospel metal debut.<br />maybe one of the best debuts ever.<br /><br />(not sure gospel metal is a thing but lets face it<br />Dug Pinnick is a truly great singer<br />and his voice is rooted in that tradition)<br /><br />4 stars! :)

0385349947|3.0|I did not love Lean In. I thought Sandberg gave contradictory advice: women don’t pursue jobs outside their current level because they perceive they are not ready yet and at the same time she advises women who are considering changing jobs/companies to go ahead and take a position that is at a lower level for the learning aspect of it. Speak up, but then an anecdote about how she had to learn not to speak up. Huh? I thought she had some good points about women’s own views on their worth in the workplace, but I know that men can and do face the same self-doubt. Yes, executive life is sexist, yet who hired and mentored her? Men. Who was portrayed as unsympathetic to Sandberg’s experience? Meg Whitman, of Ebay, a female. There are also plenty of times that a woman is hired over a man to even out the diversity aspect of a corporation.  Sandberg had the Harvard connections, Larry Summers as her mentor early on, got in at the ground floor of Google, which, although she earned her right to be there, was lucky. It is hard to overlook the spectacular jumping off point to her career and view her voice as particularly insightful.<br />I guess what I didn’t get from the book was what does Sandberg get out of her career? What does she love about what she does? Is she a natural born problem solver, who needs to feed that trait on a daily basis? Does she crave stimulation or status in a way that only the top-tier business environment can provide? Or does she purely need to be in charge of something, anything? At the same time, why did she have children, if she doesn’t seem at all absorbed or passionate about them? Or if she does feel passionate about them, why didn’t that come through in her book? The feel I got from her was more: “eh, don’t worry about the kids, they’ll be okay.” Plus, she states that there were stresses in her marital life and her home life due to the work/life balance, but she clearly glossed over them. When I read about Hillary Clinton, I understand what drives her. I didn’t know who Sandberg was before I picked up this book, and I’m still not sure why I should care about what she says after reading it.

B001BANK32|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of horror stories, but this one I liked.<br />Also, this is the first Stephen King's book I've read, but it definitely won't be my last! I very much like its style and could relate to all the characters. Definitely thinking of buying Doctor Sleep.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing! A little hard to get into but then couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this series to anyone. Awesome... I truly love it!

B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|this movie is nothing more than noise and flash.  It lacks all of the things that made STrek the enduring story it has been.  Mr Bradbury had timeless questions in his plots and the deep interpersonal relationships and complexities that made his characters interesting and important.  That quality was played against a BACKGROUND of SiFi.  This movie was hollow and flashy, nothing interesting at all.  These new movies have been increasingly hollow and this is the most empty of them.  I am surprised as JJ Abrams was involved with the earlier STs.<br /><br />This movie had nothing to to with ST except that they used familar names and vessels and clipped (and basterdized) previous ST plot lines.<br /><br />If you are a longtime fan of Star Trek, this is not good at all. You will be disappointed.
B002GTZSZU|1.0|Amadeus is a fantastic film that explores the life of famous composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The film was a huge success when it was released in 1984. I would argue this is one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />The one star rating is for this, the Blu-ray release. Amadeus when released to DVD was issued as a double sided disc with poor video transfer that needed to be flipped. My hopes for a single sided disc with cleaned up picture were raised when the film was later issued in a &#34;director's cut&#34; DVD version which added 20 minutes of cut footage. When I saw the director's cut the beauty of the original film was destroyed by unnecessary and dreadful scenes. There will be those who enjoy seeing deleted scenes, myself included. However, Amadeus was honestly perfect in its theatrical version. I found the added footage slowed down the story, ruined how you viewed certain characters and detracted from the overall story of Salieri's narrative of guilt and jealousy. When I saw a BLu Ray release was available I hope that now we would get the theatrical cut, cleaned up picture on a single sided disc. Alas, no- only the director's cut.<br /><br />Blu-Ray technology holds so much more information so it is disappointing the studio did not include the theatrical cut giving viewers an option to this vastly inferior version of such a fantastic film.<br /><br />I have used quite a bit of hyperbole to express my disgust with this film but in this case it's accurate. 1 star release for a 5 star film. A SHAME!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My daughter introduced me to Candy Crush on her iphone. (My son plays on his iphone, too). I looked for the app on my Kindle but couldn't find it. Disappointing to say the least. Recently, I checked in the app store to see what might be interesting and, lo and behold, it was there. Sooo-oo excited and it was free. So I downloaded it and am having a blast! Thanks!!!!!!
B008JFUPFI|1.0|The Man Of Steel is not a Superman movie nor should it ever be seen as one. I could have overlooked the directors complete lack of vision and originality, Zack Snider has to this day not made an original film worth seeing as far as i am concerned. All his movies have the ghost of his influences floating within each and every frame. I don't fault this movie for being a dumb pop corn flick, i like those movies when they are good, even if this one feels especially dumb. No the fact that this movie is suppose to be a Superman film is the thing that makes me hate this joyless drag of a movie the most. A Superman who has no real reason to want to save any one thanks to his earth fathers fear mongering, a Superman who lacks any real basis for even liking humanity who destroys more property and lives than he actually saves. By the middle of this movie i found my self asking if this was suppose to be the origin story of a Villain version of Superman who was going to hide wile the world burned. I found the inability by the writers to see what road they had sent their main character on that i asked if it was possible for any one to write a movie script in Hollywood. this was a clumsy attempt to make superman more human instead succeeding in making the character seem callus and down right stupid. This is the perfect superman movie for people who hate superman. If all that old fashion goodness and dignity turned you off this movie is for you, if you hate the fact that superman never gives up hope and always finds a way to resolve a problem with out taking a life hey this movie is for you. This is a waste of time and money and a waste of a good guy like Henry Cavil as the lead. Snider shouldn't be allowed to take a video of a duck pond on a borrowed cell phone, let alone direct or write another movie again. Especially one with &#34;The Man Of Steel&#34; in a staring role.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I don't think Tris death was necessary! Don't like this book :( I was very disappointed in the end. Since it's a book, an entertainment, you shouldn't make it as horrible as life....
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought 2 of these so I could test this device for a client.<br />It was simple to set up once I plugged it into USB & HDMI ports on the LCD TV and the TV on screen instructions were easy to follow via my Galaxy III phone, using my netflix account I was to watch any program.<br />Great product for the price, this means I can now disconnect my PC from the TV that did the same function.
B00CE5C8RW|5.0|First of all, it is *not* a true tourbillion. A tourbillion is a movement where the escapement is mounted in a sort of cage that counter-acts the effect of gravity on the hairspring and the pendulum's clutch. True tourbillions are very expensive and the name here is used as something of a marketing ploy.<br /><br />That said, the watch is fantastic. It works great and it looks like a million bucks. First of all, anyone who thinks the watch doesn't work needs to realize that it is an AUTOMATIC watch. Meaning it has no battery so you have to wind it! When you first receive the watch give it a dozen turns of the crown then WEAR IT on your wrist. You should wear this watch at least a few hours a day so that the mainspring remains wound. I haven't yet had the watch stop on me. But we'll see and I'll update this review as needed.<br /><br />The piece is by no means perfect. But I dare you to find an automatic that looks this good at this price.
080019683X|5.0|The movie was REALLY awsome.  I had problem in that I ordered a DVD version and I received a VHS. This movie is an excellent family movie and educational.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Great acting, fast paced drama, and I'm in love with Sherlock, surely the sexiest Brit I've ever encountered. Can't wait for Season Three!!
B000MQC9H4|4.0|I ordered this movie and still enjoy it although it has been out for quite a while.  It is quickly becoming a classic Christmas (and anytime) movie.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Very good movie with lots of the action you expect in a cartoon made movie.  The non-reality parts do some what take away from the movie plot, but if you ignore this issue the movie is very good.
0385341008|5.0|This book was probably the best book I have read last month and will probably be one of the best books I have read this year. What is  it about ? Horrors of Natzi occupation of Guernsey, yes (some of it quite graphic, but so very real),  but also triumph of human spirit and some really wonderful people who struggled hard to survive and love each other, and books many books which helped to maintain their spirits. Because of course books could not save you from what was happening,  but  I am of the firm belief that books could help , especially when books strengthened their friendships.<br /><br />And I really loved how the book mixes painful and light hearted moments, I thought story was really successful in that. I also was very impressed that epistolary novel achieved what very few books could do in this format for me. Usually letter style story distances the characters and events from me, but in this one they came out alive and interesting.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great book. Easy to read. It Changes your perspective on the prison system.  Departure from the netflix show for sure.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Love this movie. The product arrived in perfect condition and met all of my expectations.  Great entertainment with top-notch stars dealing with complex relationship issues.
B00G9QLP9Y|3.0|Not very good as expected, when I try to move 360 degree view of the street view it doesn't move smoothly.
B00BEIYLAW|3.0|I saw this movie in the theater and really liked it a lot. The reason I gave it only 3 stars in this review is that the DVD/Blu-ray release differs from the theatrical release in that the language has been cleaned up a bit, perhaps to make the home video release get a PG-13 rating? In particular, I specifically remember the &#34;F&#34; word being used in at least two scenes: when Jobs fires the software engineer for not including the multiple fonts option in Lisa Write (he told him &#34;you either get on board, or get the &#34;F&#34; out!&#34;); also, when he calls up Bill Gates in a rage for copying the Mac GUI look and feel he calls him (I'm paraphrasing here) &#34;you &#34;F&#34;-ing psychopath!&#34;<br /><br />Look, I can get by without the &#34;F&#34; word, my main complaint is that this DVD/Blu-ray release is not the same as the theatrical release but I cannot find any mention of that anywhere. There may be other differences as well, I just can't recall every detail of the theatrical release.<br /><br />I would rate the theatrical release 4 stars, but the home version on gets 3 stars for being deceptive.
B004T4KKSA|5.0|The size of this book can be daunting, but once you get started it becomes a page turner. I was so hoping to read the author's perspective & inside story on the Iraq occupation, Cheney's secret energy meetings, & the latest turn of events with fracking's impact on world politics now the US is producing more oil than it imports, & could turn into a net gas exporter. But maybe that's part II.<br />Of course we can't ignore the compromises hydrocarbon extraction & it's consumption has on the environment & climate; I would like to have read perspectives beyond the polar political rhetoric and what governments really are planning to address the future population dislocations & water contamination. We have to manage both energy production & its consequences.<br />This book gives rare insights into how nations and their respective power brokers manage and project power and capital to establish security, dominance and economic power. If you're interested in these subjects, as well as oil economics, then read this book.

Passed this one onto my SIL who has four kids to occupy her time.

B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Probably the best MIB in the series.  A few scenes looked like the snuck past post production/editing, but don't drag the movie down, rather add to the campy wierdness that makes this series on of the best Sci-fi out there.
