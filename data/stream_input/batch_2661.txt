B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I play this game all the time. Very challenging. So many levels and not so easy that it's boring. I would recommend it to all who need an intresring time killer.
0553579908|5.0|My husband and I have been reading through these books- they are a great &#34;get away&#34; read.  Though sometimes we need to be careful because they will keep you up at night not wanting to put the book down!
B001DM1VXE|2.0|I've watched this movie twice and while I found it interesting the first time around I've come to the conclusion that it is riddled with too many problems to merit a positive review.  For one, the protagonist, Max, is one-dimensional.  He is just unlikable. Yes, he is a mathematician and likely has a functional form of autism, Asberger's. And yes the movie builds on the Van Gough-connected theme that genius and madness are synonymous. In other words, a monomaniacal seeker after the truth like Max and Van Gough, or say a Victor Frankenstein or Ahab, exchange their humanity for the Promethean power of a revolutionary insight.  In the case of Max his discovery of a sequence of 216 individual numbers and its revolutionary applications to penetrating the mysteries of the physical world, especially the stock market, and maybe even God Himself, leads to a nervous breakdown and a Van-Gough like suicidal self-inflicted mutilation of his skull with a drill.  But at the very end of the movie we are led to believe that Max does make a personal breakthrough and finds peace. (I don't buy it. He's already dead, right?) The Elysian scene in question is a hallucinatory depiction of Max's death and transfiguration.  (One thinks of Goethe's Faust, or the end of the movie &#34;Gladiator.&#34;)  A child he knows has a computer and asks him what 748 divided by 238 is. The answer: pi. (That dreaded number series.) So he must be in heaven, right?<br /><br /> So my beef with the flick is that Max doesn't develop as a character;  instead he remains chained to a self-destructive passion that alienates him from mankind.  (I think of Max as a man incapable of self-perspective.)  I guess when I watch a film, any kind really, from B-rated sci fi to goofy comedies and Oscar winners, I want the principal character to mature and gain insight into the limitations of his or her own psychology.  So when I see a character hobbled by his own hubris and sense of self-importance, who lacks a sense of humorand thereby refuses to understand his own humanity and its limitations, I am annoyed.  In a way &#34;Pi&#34; is a Greek tragedy, of a man who has been vouchsafed a superhuman power (mathematical genius), and he is destroyed by the gods because of his hubris.<br />Also the jerky camera angles and surreal use of lighting was difficult to work with.  .
B009RH973I|3.0|its a nice color and very protective but the thing is that it does not have a magnetic thing on the case so it turns off so i have to turn it off every time and it is  ripping around where it says Marware and thats not very good  and everything else is fine so i like it but not love it.and i was a little disapointed and it was kinda expensive also sometimesit drops your kindle fire HD and its very loud and your droping your tablet and that is not good at all
0140449337|5.0|The author's private thoughts on life and his own examination of how to meet daily life in the most positive and understanding way, is well worth examining.
1469220717|5.0|After reading the reviews posted while I waiting for my copy to arrive, I am not sure what those readers were reading.  I don't put any<br />stock into reviews  and will watch or read the subjects I am interested in and it is a good thing.  Entwined with You was even better<br />than Reflected in You.  The very first paragraph brought to light a possible storyline I hadn't even given any thought to.  I thoroughly<br />enjoyed this book and finished it in seven hours NOW I can't wait for the next saga of Gideon and Eva.  AWESOME storyline.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Be careful on the random treaure chests that glimmer for anminute or two -- some of them are free to open, and provide extra plankton. Overall, one of the best games to date in my opinion, and I've been involved with a dozen of these kinds to date, including Gameloft, the Tiny franchise,  the Story franchise, and a few Independents. Nemo's Reef and Pou are my lasting favorites, bar none.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love how the creator(s) of Temple Run 2 created many obstacles for the player to avoid. Great job and a big thumbs up to him/her/them.
B0064J6OMO|5.0|Yes it was a little vulgar but still made me laugh!!! Ca't believe it came out in 2011 and I just now got to watch it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game itself is AWSOME TO KILL TIME because u have a lot more feateures then Temple run . U get a mine and zipline.  AWSOME GAME GET IT NOW ITS SO AWSOME TO MUCH AWSOMENESS
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game, it has many fun scenes.  I'm a big fan of these type of games. I compare this to games like one hundred floors but I think this one is a little bit easier. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys hunting games.
B009NYF2GQ|3.0|Such a wonderful movie deserved a better quality for Blu-Ray. It doesn't have the impressive picture older movies even from the 30's have. So many old pictures look as if they were just out of the editing room when transferred to the new format. Cabaret is not as sharp, some times it is even out of focus! I loved this movie ever since it came out, I have the DVD version and I am disappointed with the Blu Ray copy, doesn't make justice to a movie that change a generation.
061301328X|5.0|Exciting book. Different and unexpected. It's very long, but worth spending time on. At first you dislike the Japanese of that period, but then you change your mind.
B001TODCII|5.0|Turn her loose now and that will be the end of it. I have yet saw a bad movie that Liam was in. He is the best of the best, no one liners just does what he said he will. Like any know it all teen who thinks dad is to strict do what she want, he did all he could to stop his daughter from going to France even going as far asking his x her-mom not to let her go. Once she gets there the action does not stop till the end. I am not talking about doing things that you and I only happens in the movies. Every thing he did is possible. So get you some corn sat back and start the ride.
0307352153|5.0|This book is so helpful to learn more about what it means to savor quiet and not disdain introverts.  This book has given me so much insight!

B006CDCWDM|5.0|\\"It's important for me to win, at everything. I have no sense of humor about losing.\\"<br /><br />A close-up, personal and honest view at the man, the Nadal family, and the game of tennis - roughly in that order. First, the book offers a great perspective into Nadal's life: the early years, his tennis training with his uncle, and his work ethic. Next up is his family, which is an integral part of his success: everything is a family business, all succeed when one succeeds. As I appreciate now, you can't talk about Rafa without talking about his family, and the role they played in his success.<br /><br />Finally, the tennis game... After you've put in the hard training hours, suffered through all the pain, and are now facing your opponent on the court, where to from here? As Rafa puts it: the matches are decided by handful of points. It's all about the mental game, and the book places a strong emphasis on the importance of \\"mindful execution\\" - following routines, sticking to the plan, letting go of mistakes, acknowledging the flashes of brilliance from your opponent, and so on. Lots of great lessons here, and not just for the tennis fans. Great read.
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|I played this game for a few weeks and really enjoyed it. One day it stopped working (wont load) I tried everything including a uninstall and re-install, nothing worked. Amazon customer service no help at all either. Really disappointed.

B0058YPGL6|4.0|I recently watched MTV's TEEN WOLF: SEASON 1 and TEEN WOLF: SEASON 2. You could say it was a lonnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggg Teen Wolf marathon. (lol) For a MTV show...it's not THAT bad. (lol) Apparently it's based on the Michael J. Fox movie, TEEN WOLF but instead of the high school `teen wolf' playing basketball in the movie...well...in the TV series he plays lacrosse. While watching it - I realized it's a teen, comedy, drama MTV show. (lol) Lets just say my wife's not a fan of this show...but it's ok because I ammmmmmmmm. (lol)<br /><br />In season 1 - you meet Scott and the crew. Everyone seems normal until Scott played by Tyler Posey gets bite by a wolf...soon he becomes...TEEN WOLF. So now he has to deal with THAT...high school...his lacrosse team...and his new high school crush on Allison Argent, who's played by the sexy and beautiful Crystal Reed. Stiles (from the movie) played by Dylan O'Brien is Scott's best friend and crazy sidekick. He's all in love with Lydia Martin who's played by the sexy red head Holland Roden. She's the popular `mean girl' of the school who happens to be dating the captain of the lacrosse team...douche bag Jackson played by Colton Haynes (Arrow). Then we meet lone wolf Derek Hale played by Tyler Hoechlin. He's searching for the one who killed his sister - - he's got his own wolf problems to deal but soon meets Scott and well...it gets a little crazy. (lol)<br /><br />In season 2 - all hell breaks loose. EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE has their problems. (lol) Scott's having to deal with high school drama, other werewolves, hunters...YES. Hunters who wanna kill werewolves, some lizard creature (which is kind of cool) - kind of reminded me of something you'd see in SPIDERMAN and there's a lot more. (lol)<br /><br />THERE SURE IS A LOT OF `SHIRTS OFF' IN THIS SERIES...so ladies. If you've never watched a TEEN WOLF episode...ya might wanna check it out. (lol) I think it's a fun and entertaining watch. Plus Crystal Reed's dimples and Holland Roden are good to the eyes. (lol) The Season 2 3-disc DVD has some cool features. On disc 1 - you can watch the TEEN WOLF Season 2 at Paleyfest 2012 event. It's a pretty cool Q&A with the cast. On disc 2 - there's the CGI and fight reels...pretty cool stuff and on disc 3 you can watch the gag reel, \\"Meet the new wolf pack battlefield\\" and for the ladies...SHIRTLESS MONTAGE 2.0 (lol) There's other stuff on the discs...you just gotta pick what you like. Over all - the season 2 DVD is a tight little package.<br /><br />I give TEEN WOLF: SEASON 2... 3 out of 5 popcorns!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|See it in 3D if possible. We've seen it both ways and it is great in wither but 3D is amazing. Wonderful story with an incredible surprise ending. Film is true to the book. A must see!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS - This is definitely NOT the Hansel & Gretel I remembered as a kid. (lol) Actually...IT'S BETTER!! (lol) Yeah, Yeah...I just might've be the only one who liked this movie. (lol) What can I say...I thought it was an entertaining, over the top movie. (lol) Jeremy Renner as Hansel was cool. Gemma Arterton as Gretel...talk about gangsta AND hot! I JUST LOVE THAT GIRL! (lol) Famke Janssen as the main evil witch...just lovely...just when she wasn't a witch. (lol) I liked a lot about this movie - the head's exploding, all the different witches, the excessive blood and guts AND even the occasional F-bombs from Gretel - that was a nice touch. Don't think I know though...there is a little `cheese' in this movie. Gretel's fighting skills at times...she whoops evil witches asses but can't take on a few HUMAN men? Come on now?! (lol)<br /><br />Oh and parent's out there - - not sure if you'd want your kid's seeing this `not so' nursery rhyme of a movie. (lol) I'd let mine though. BYAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!<br /><br />I give HANSEL & GRETEL: WITCH HUNTERS... 3 out of 5 popcorns. It was just my kind of movie.
B000FZERIG|5.0|i've heard it said that every album that george harrison did after &#34;all things must pass&#34; was hailed as his &#34;best album since 'all things must pass.'&#34;  well, i just bought both this album and &#34;all things must pass&#34; and this is, by far, the better album.  the theme of the songs is more cohesive.  the songwriting is better.  the musicality is better.  this is not to say that &#34;all things must pass&#34; isn't a good album.  but if you're just getting into classic george harrison and you're trying to find a good album to start with, i would recommend this one, which also gives you insight into his continued spriritual journey and longing for a relationship with his god.
B003Y5H57E|4.0|CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE - It took me long enough to see this...I really don't know why I didn't see this in the theater...perhaps it was because of Emma Stone. I just haven't grown to like her in movies...but maybe one day.<br />Steve Carell was hilarious is this though. Ryan Gosling's a pimp and Marisa Tomei gets hotter with age. (lol) But seriously - I thought this was one funny movie. I know it may look like a depressing love, comedy...but it's not all that. It's definitely worth the watch.<br />I give CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE... 4 out of 5 popcorns!
B00005214X|4.0|the album, to me, seems thrown together.  later george harrison works have a feel to them that's more cohesive, planned, thought-out, and the music and songwriting is more refined.  all that isn't to say that this isn't a good album.  but my opinion is that his later works outshine this one.
B008ROG1QI|5.0|One of America's great movies. This is the true story of the harrowing final 25th mission of the first WWII B-17 crew to complete their required missions and go home. The movie was riveting and exhilarating even though I had seen the film many years ago.<br />A must see American film.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I truly enjoyed his genuinely honest and real account about his experience and life.  This world has many heroes and he is one of them.  He encompasses the heart of what it means and what it takes to protect others.  Regardless of how you feel about war, this man is as courageous as they come and has a heart of gold.  RIP Chris Kyle.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|The film deserves all the awards it has won. As Pi reviled, he has a great story and a lesson.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps you interested. Good game when you need to pass some time. The puzzles could be a bit more challenging.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This is an interesting mystery with great performances by accomplished actors and it keeps your attention. Good entertainment when your in the mood for a movie.
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I was a bit disapointed that the movie was split up into two but this was very close to the book and I did enjoy it. I have to look forward to the second half now.
1442364203|4.0|I just finished listening to this story and have to say first of the flurry of emotions that pounded me through this novel. Mariam and Laila are the two points of view in this story. They are women growing up and living in Afghanistan through the heartaches from war, the mistreatment by their husband, and their roles as women living in Afghanistan. I felt for these women through every step of the story.<br /><br />This powerful narrative brought alive the fears, joy, and struggles these women had in their lives. I would recommend this story to anyone.<br />You are the author of this review
B009KEN87O|5.0|Back in the day arcade.  Enjoy trying to get out of the way of fire,  the bonus players, going 3-D is awesome and I try to get it at every play.  If you like arcade type games give this a try you won't be disappointed.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|it is very good game<br />i love it. I will play in part 3. Fajna gra szczerze polecam wszystkim... nic tylko grac
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|The style that Caitlin uses, being very self-deprecating, is a great way of communicating some of society's contradictions and hypocrisies. Her approach also reinforces how women and men have still got  a way to go to reach full equality.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm a book worm, reading books from easy mind fluff to great works. This book is a good read. You get a real feel for each person and the plot. All in all I would recommend this book for easy quick read nice for a trip or in the bath, maybe for a middle school book report.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|What a wonderful author! The very fine character definition and emotional sensitivity is a pleasure to read. Added to this are the wonderful life insights.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|Too many breaks in between the story lines. Fight scenes just aren't believable and the book ends poorly, the expectation is built that there is something more never materializes.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|While this was an action packed episode in the Die Hard series, it lacked many of the interesting characteristics of the previous films. It appeared to be a typical soviet block grade-B action film.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME NO FLAWS AT ALL!! It is purrfect!! :) So much fun! When my friend showed it to me i HAD to get it i mean who doesn't LOVE LPS?!
B00821OX98|4.0|This show is a modern take on War of the Worlds but better - love the action and all the actors in it especially the main ones
B003K16P3M|5.0|I loved this book! It reminded me a LOT of The Hunger Games, so much so that I looked the publication dates of both books up to see if Graceling was a \\"rip-off\\" of The Hunger Games. Graceling came out less than one month after The Hunger Games, therefore I have concluded that the similarities are coincidental.<br /><br />If you liked The Hunger Games, you will like Graceling too. It is an excellent read and I'm looking forward to reading more from Kristin Cashore!<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />Katsa's refusal to commit.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The originality.<br /><br />Appropriate for a younger audience:<br />Yes, although there are a couple of PG-13 scenes.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Told from the viewpoint of a lovely character...a dog. I found it touching and tender and funny at times. It was a quick read with a satisfying ending.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Earth Wind & Fire has always been a favorite.  This CD album of their hits is great.  I would have added a few more songs, but all in all, this is an excellent hits album and I recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Took me about an hour to finish. Some of the puzzles kept me stumped for a bit. Started to take notes to keep things straight. In all its a good free game.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This is a great game.It is a while to get their but I think this game it's like temple run only not in the sky!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|this game is really fun. I am so glad they finally made it available on android devices! great game!!! nice
B005S9EL6C|5.0|I love this movie as well as the first 3. It was awesome and filled with creativity! And I was glad to see sum of the actors and actress's from the previous movies..a must see in my book!
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far so good!  We've only just started but we like it so far. Picture is really small. Wish we could zoom in better.
B00338CMTI|5.0|Excellent! I bought this book for my 15 year old son. He started reading it and didn't stop until he was finished!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters and story are captivating. It  is a view into the past but human nature is never changing. I just recommend if you haven't watched any Downton Abbey start with Season 1.
B000BB1MHS|4.0|Like the story alot! Johnny Depp is great as always! My favorite is still the original Willy Wonka, but this film is certainly entertaining!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love the game! Sometimes the objects don't do what u want at the right time but you just have to keep trying things. Good game for sure!
B0080SW3CC|5.0|This book is a classic! John Steinbeck is a literary genius! I really enjoyed reading this book. It displays perfectly the bonds of friendship and the hopes and dreams of those in the early 20th century.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Nice to be able to see all the fantastic episodes again. Some huge laughs. Can't go wrong with the best series on television.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Matilda is a great story for kids 2 to 92! Enjoyed watching this with my grandkids! Now my granddaughter wants a LIssy doll! So do I!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Beautifully written. Fascinating characters. Impeccably historically accurate account of this little-known chapter in American history. I highly recommend this book.
0061950726|5.0|Reading about the children at the hands of their benefactors was heartbreaking yet the children persevered and overcame their conditions.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|\\"Secret of the Wings\\" is a comedic and lighthearted movie that draws on the adventures of Tinkerbell when she ends up in Winterworld. She is well aware of the grave risks in going to such a place, but a part of her feels compelled to continue on after meeting her kindred spirit Periwinkle.  One of the hidden messages symbolizes to be that of unity due to scenes showing various members from Winterworld and Tinker Bell's world working together in certain scenes. \\"Secret Of The Wings\\" is both a cheery and feel good type of animated movie safe for all ages.
B000F8O35U|3.0|Expensive for a DVD that gets scratched easily. Wish this were available online. Seven more words are required for this review.
B00D0SA8I8|5.0|I frequently travel in places where there's no wi-fi or cell signal, so it's important to me to have map data installed locally. OsmAnd is by far the best offline mapping program I've found -- it's packed with features and the offline maps work really well. It's been great for exploring dirt roads in the Mojave desert as well as trails all over the western US. It's also open source and has a great mailing list where you can ask questions. I haven't used the routing much, but for basic maps, favorites, waypoints and elevation, it can't be beat.
0679729895|5.0|Who doesn't love Roald Dahl, whatever he writes? Can you imagine that his teachers in grade school told him that he had no future as  a writer. Thankfully the guy never took such criticism to heart (a lesson to teach our kids - don't listen to people who say you can't do something, when you not only can - but you're meant to). Et voila - a terrifically entertaining collection of his short stories for adults. I especially love William and Mary.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It works on my Samsung Note II most of the time and then freezes up for some unknown reason. Hope they work out the bugs and put out an update.

0143037757|5.0|I see there are a lot of views expressed in the reviews here disagreeing with Judt's viewpoints on various issues. By and large I am happy with his views although at various points his emphases are different to mine.<br /><br />What most interests me however is how this book covers certain key areas of European development which I have not previously had the opportunity of considering in such depth.<br /><br />These are:<br /><br />The extent of the devastation of almost all Europe and the necessary reconstruction, apparently accomplished with amazing speed after the war, and the enormous importance of cleverly designed Marshall Aid in achieving this;<br /><br />The development of the Iron Curtain, the rapidly changing perceptions by the rest of the world of Stalin's intentions and activities, and in particular how this was experienced by the eastern European countries themselves. I had mostly been used to considering this from a western perspective.<br /><br />The development of the Common Market, mostly at the instigation of the French, who just as they had after the First World War, wanted to protect themselves, but this time the muscle and strength was always and increasingly provided by Germany.<br /><br />Prior to reading this book I didn't really understand quite how the EEC had worked, its parameters, its purpose and limitations.<br /><br />Judt's views on later events were less revelatory to me because I had been there at the time, but his perspectives are always interesting.<br /><br />Judt takes great care to consider the experience of many different countries, and as he does so I learned an enormous amount about the differences between say the Czech, the Polish, the Yugoslavian experience of being communist.<br /><br />His epilogue is a consideration of the experience of the Jews after the war and I found this too especially valuable, and although he does not discuss the state of Israel, Judt helped me understand why the establishment of the Israeli state was so important.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|got me hooked into the Camel Club and now have read the first four and looking to read the fifth and from what i understand final Camel Club book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Downloaded the game one night because I was bored, became instantly addicted. I love it! I would definitely recommend it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but it needs to have more things to. do.  I think this game needs more power oj the specail fetures. please chang. this
0763644765|4.0|I THOUGHT IT WAS A CUTE BOOK. IT'S VERY EASY FOR A 2 YEAR OLD TO UNDERSTAND<br />JUST BY LOOKING AT THE PICTURES. HE IS 2 NOW, AND HE IS SITTING ON THE POTTY ALREADY.<br />HE WENT TWICE SO FAR, BUT HE SITS ON IT A LOT.<br /><br />  LEE DEE
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun game. It is one worth playing with others. It a good way to pass time when you have the free time.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Just as addictive as all the other Montezuma.  This game is addictive and  it's worth the money.<br />I remember how much fun the other Montezuma games had been.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a good puzzle game.  Some are challenging witha good vvariety of puzzle types. Only wish there were more puzzles.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|cant wait for more levels! hope they will be more of a challenge. Its to short but it was free!
B004L0NGEC|4.0|I can easily access my Picasa web album and new photos appear very quickly . A good app and to date trouble free .
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I liked it but it was pretty easy. I bought it about 15 minutes ago and I finished just now. The last level was the hardest for me. I think it is worth it if you like fast games and you beat the game in one sitting. But other than that it was a fun game! Plus...its free so you wont lose anything if you download it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked it. It was just the right amount of challenge to keep my brain thinking. Some puzzles were a little harder than others but that's what made me want to play more.
145210655X|5.0|I made a goody gift bag and this was one of the items in it (he grew up with Star Wars).
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Sequels are hard. Period. There's only a handful of movies that pulled off a good second one, let alone a third one. Die Hard managed 3 great movies and a 4th that was pretty alright.<br /><br />And they should have stopped there.<br /><br />A Good Day to Die Hard is pretty boring, a plot with a pretentious twist on top of a cheesy family-bonding adventure. Bruce Willis is there, but it feels like he isn't, there's nothing of his witty and unique charm that has been the distinctive brand of the Die Hard series.<br /><br />Your best to spend your time on something else.
B00AQF8CJ0|1.0|bored me to death. Not my cup of tea at all. Maybe you'll like it better. It's at least nice that we can uninstall, so we have room to try new things.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|So fun its almost like instagram! (3 you can edit ur photos with lots of different setting they look amazing! You will love it guaranteed! (3
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice puzzle game. The challenges were not to tough but required a little thought. Only ten floors but it was free. I will play any new additions so keep them coming!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love the graphics and the new spawn eggs in the creative inventory. Try all the editions of minecraft, like the computer edition or the X-box edition.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Funny movie with lots of little subtle bits...great cast with wonderful acting.  It is well worth the price...one of the funniest movies around.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book<br />Cant wait for the movie to come out should be awesome like the first one. Read
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book had me guessing and confused throughout the thing. I really don't feel like it's complete..like I need a book sequel!
B008GJV4F2|5.0|And it is Johnny Depp.  Gypsies, misunderstood witch? or maybe not, who know why she knows exactly what kind of chocolate will cure your ills.  I bought it to watch over and over again.  And did I tell you about the lessons we learn about tolerance
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|Simply put, this is BKV at his absolute best.  If you like Y the last man you'll love this book.  If you loved Firefly, you'll love Saga.
1600597963|5.0|I use this book as a reference a lot and I haven't had it that long yet. Great guidelines to go by also.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first then saw I could rent free with Amazon prime. What  a page  turner.  Can't wait to read the next one.
0060849827|4.0|if you camp, hike or hunt or just in case , this is a small size possible life saver. Lots of survival do's and don'ts. I would recommend to any outdoor person.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|FUN AND addictive....DOEs get progessively harder but always doable...one of my favorites...enough said...need more games like this...again good very good...
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game but it makes a weird noise and it got some lag but I still love it
0307352153|5.0|This book is a keeper, and will join &#34;The Introvert Advantage&#34; and &#34;Party of One, A Loner's Manifesto&#34; as books I keep around to remind me that introverts are just fine.  We don't need fixing.<br /><br />I was especially interested in the author's take on how extroverts might have caused, or at least worsened the financial fiasco by talking over the quiet voices that warned of instability. Oh, how I wish they had listened....
B00CWY76CC|4.0|First of all this game isn't like 100 floors. Rather than having just one scene to explore you have a whole room and occasionally there's a puzzle or two to complete. I really enjoyed this game.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|This microphone is great for the studio, easy 5/5 there. However, I'm experiencing difficulties with feedback while using it in a practice space with my band. This may just be my issue with speaker/amp set up. Overall, an insane mic for its price!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|If you like Yachtzee you'll like this version. I've got it for my iPhone and for my Android Pad good fun and it's much better with this ad free version! Recommended!
B003V4AK8E|3.0|It's alright. I got it for my boyfriend because he's an xbox lover, but we have a playstation... the shape and feel of the controller is fine, but the wireless connection isn't the best. If my dog happens to get in the way, the controller will freeze and I loose at my game of Mortal Kombat.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|This a very good app.  Good sequel to original and some nice additions.  Well worth the cost and great time killer.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love the app. Just the right amount of challenge. My big disappointment was in there only being ten levels. Seems way too short. Would love to have  had more to start..
B001BGTWXI|3.0|Monotonous and loud. A lot of the songs feel more like noise than music, and that is coming from someone who has been listening to Slipknot for the better part of 13 yrs. The music felt forced and while the lyrical content is pretty good, it just felt like something was missing (for me, at least). I didn't hate it, but it certainly won't become a favorite.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I chose the 5 star rating because this book is the best of its kind. It's gripping, funny, very engaging (You can put it down but you don't want to). The book reads like a Jules Verne novel (I'm thinking \\"Mysterious Island\\".  The characters are interesting and you want to know more about them.<br /><br />It is great science fiction.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It was a gift for my wife's bday. I got her into harry potter 2 years ago n she's been a fan since. Came on time. Perfect packaging. All movies were brand new. No problems at all. Thanks guys.
1439153663|5.0|I LOVE this book! The depth that you get to know Belle and Lavinia is powerful. They become your friends and you cheer for them, cry for them and hope for them. And what a great way to start the book with the ending.<br />It really made me understand so much about where the story was going and how it got there. Lavinia is a poor girl making choices that anyone would make in her shoes. And, the book helped me to understand why one generation sometimes follows the past even thou they know the sadness and destruction they are headed for.  It also helped me appreciate how far we have come. My only complaint is that the journeys over. I'd love to read a sequel!
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|I can't believe I watched the entire movie as it went no where right away. Characters didn't have any depth. Story line was weak. Skip it.
B000XUAEUS|4.0|The author takes the reader on and an adventure through the life of a less then successful author. The book is written like a diary or journal and begins when the character is very young. You get to see the different emotional and intellectual changes that the character goes through as they grow into adulthood and beyond. Its a good read and I would suggest it to anyone.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Another great album by one of Rock's troubadors.  His solo efforts still thrill with great guitar work, melodies and lyrics, not to mention one of the greatest voices in music.  Another wonderful album for anyone's collection.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|was very good and the kids just loved it . i am going to buy it for them. need to make more movies like this .i give this movie 5 stars.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm hooked.  Can't wait for the movie to come out.  I like to read books that I know are coming out as a movie.  I was very pleased with the ending.  I'm hoping they continue on with all of Enders adventures.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|Me and my daughter both love this app.  We mix songs together and. It. Works great.  Gotta load more songs and keep mixing.
B009K916ZK|5.0|It connects my laptop to a projector. For, you know, projecting stuff.<br /><br />Arrived on time and unharmed, no problems with hardware or software incompatibility. Just make sure this is the right model for your computer before ordering.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great this book is a page turner  a bit unexcepting  of the fifty shades and how the girl was trying to work this out as he was her first
B006OCM0G0|4.0|it was really fun to play and make your restruant grow but WARNING it says its free but it actually makes you pay other than that it was fun I liked bakery story better though
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Game was fun while it lasted.  Wished game had more floors.  I cant think of any more words to describe this tam.
B004I744AS|5.0|Ive been using this dictionary since. I like the learning games on it and very easy to use. Its not just a dictionary. There are lots of fun facts on it. I love that they have this app for kindle. Always recommend it to my friends.
B008DVJOYG|4.0|This album is loaded with great songs. It's Springsteen doing what he does best... Rockin' and Rollin' throughout. Terrific album.
0694003611|5.0|We almost wore this board book out reading it over and over to our daughter when she was a toddler.  She loved it, and therefore so did we!
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Well my wife and I gave this to our 7 year old son while we went to Las Vegas while Grandma and Grandpa watch him for several days.  I thought he was going to be at it for several weeks to maybe a month to keep him occupied especially while we were away.  He finished it in 1 day and to our disappointment.  However since he completed it, he loves playing with it and spends hours pretending to drive it and going on a camping trip.
B002VECM6S|5.0|What can you say about true stories & Sandra Bullock? Nice to see a movie where you don't have to leave the room because of all the offensive language & violence. Very nice to see how great Sandra Bullock was as a supporting cast member, as she let the hero be center stage. Truly she knows how to act & I like watching her in this role.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne  kept the story alive and the characters that are new are just as interesting as the old. Makes sure you want to read the next book NOW.
B005K17RU0|1.0|what if any focus group decided this was a good idea?<br />seems to me to be another app that needs to be deleted.loved the old app.wish I could get it back.liked this one the best now what?
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was just a fun way to spend an afternoon.  The cast is amazing, and they all had such fun with it.  Helen Mirren is so spectacular.  I laughed out loud several times.  Well worth renting - I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it.  Worth the price just to see Bruce Willis reading a romance novel!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Love this game. I have it on my kindle. It never gets old to me. I even downloaded the zombie add on which is fun also.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Love this movie.  It's filled with action, comedy, drama and it keeps you thoroughly entertained from beginning to end.  Can't wait for part two in 2015.
B007EDZ20O|5.0|Hitchens hated Mother Theresa and brings the facts to demonstrate why. Mother Theresa had friends of various background to support her. They appeared to have ulterior motives.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|If you like pogo' s golf soltaire game you will love this one! It has great graphics and sound. Have fun!
B00D3V8PSC|4.0|Not great, but it sounds old school. An awesome alternative to the trash that's in the radio these days. Money well spent
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|Love his voice and music style, only wish there would have been more songs on this CD only10, brings back memories from the rock era
B00B9LNK5G|5.0|This album came highly recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />If you are not familiar with John Grant, give him a try, there is nothing to lose here.
0062255657|5.0|I get a giant boner for stories with Ocean in the title (see: A Light Between Oceans) and this story did not disappoint! Using prose in the most efficient way possible (that's really the only word I can use to explain it), Neil blurs the lines between fantasy and reality, and with great pacing, I might add. You can read this in one or two sittings, making it a good candidate for in-flight reading.<br /><br />As for the cons, the character development department IS a little lacking, but he makes up for it with a more-than-enjoyable writing style.<br /><br />I'm not sure how he was able to condense this amount of awesomeness in about 200 pages. I feel so lucky to have discovered him. Definitely pick this book up and if you enjoy it check out \\"Neverwhere\\" for something meatier to chew on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm addicted 2 this game YOU GOTTA GET IT :P I love it and I have had it for 2 years and I still love it :-)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's a great game! the graphics are amazing everything looks so real. you should sooooo get this app<br />this app is a must get
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book will change the way you look at people, whether you already have an open mind or not. Asher's format kept the pages turning  and kept me so intact that, before I knew it, I finished it less than two days.<br /><br />I really love how, instead of separating Hannah and Clay' s dialogue into chapters, he contrasted them both back and forth in order to make it realistic and flow effectively. This book hopefully will pass onto future generations and hopefully open the eyes and ears of those who wouldn't consider taking a second glance at a person.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game has been flourishing for years and more and more people continue to buy the game. You can create many different worlds and they can all be what you would like them to be. Sometimes it can take awhile to make, say, a house because you have to add block after block. If there was a way to make a basic structure instead of having to repeatedly tap then it would be much more enjoyable for me.<br /><br />I originally got Minecraft on my PC but I then got it on my Kindle Fire. I did not however get it in the app store. I went to 4shared.com and downloaded it for free. I recommend this to anyone who would like to get Minecraft Pocket Edition. It would save you a large amount of money.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's very fun to play if you like the idea of building your own Jurassic pa r k. There are many different types of dinosaurs and cool little facts about them. I definitely recommend this product for Dino-lovers.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|First time I saw this movie, I thought it  would be creepy like ''IT'', but it wasn't. I was really pleased there wasn't any gore. The soundtrack for the movie was just right and was as amazing as the movie itself. The movie was funny at times and overall I just loved it! No need for a big review here. It's a classic movie with no real gore or horror. It's an awesome classic that I think many people should watch. Today's movies are trying hard to be super-realistic and very gory and scary. But often they fail because what matters most to me is to be entertained, and this movie delivers! I am so keeping this movie in my collection!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is great you get to do her make up and hair you get to pick out her dress and shoes plus it's free
B009NY43NY|3.0|I'm going to miss reading more about Sookie.<br />Charlaine Harris pulled me into a world of imagination and suspense. What a great series. The tv show will never top these stories.
B00APYKXFS|3.0|There have been a lot of one star reviews that I think are unfair. This is a frantic, shoot them before they shoot you game. That's all it is. There is no time to plan any strategy. Personally I prefer Plasma Sky for it's colorful waves and variety. This game has no obnoxious permissions or other reasons to knock it except that it is simply too fast to really \\"play\\".
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I love Agent Pendergast and have read all the books in the series. I found this one, Two Graves, a bit forced, as if the authors were searching for a story to tell and whose story to tell. Yet, as always with the books in this series, it is erudite, well written, and coherent. I trust the next will be back on track.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well, all those people who complain about the quality of tv programs  must not have watched this. It is beautifully done with finely drawn characters. Cannot waitfor more !
B006M4F67A|5.0|There are a lot of different versions to play and it is great for a quick game to pass the time. My kids enjoy playing it too and often fight over who gets to play it next.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|After reading the &#34;Kite Runner&#34; and &#34;A Thousand Summers&#34; by this author, I approached this book with high expectations, as in both these books the author has set the bar really high (among the best I have read over the last few years).  However, whilst this book was still an enjoyable read,  for me Khaled Hosseini's &#34;And the Mountains Echoed&#34; did not resonate in quite the same way as the other two novels. I did not get as involved in his characters and setting, but perhaps it is unreasonable to expect every book of his to be one of my favourites!  I'd still encourage others to read this, as  it still illuminates rich tapestries of life in colourful ways.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Just magnificent; No words can really describe this album.<br /><br />Combine some openHub synced Hue LEDs lighting and wow!<br /><br />Outstanding Lindsey!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Arrived quickly and couldn't stop watching the lst two seasons.  I would recommend this product very much.  I've<br />since ordered the 3rd season from a different vendor and after weeks am still waiting.  I believe it states that it<br />will be here by the 17th.  I sure hope so because I'm going through withdrawal of this program.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I usually don't like English movies because I cannot understand most of the dialect however this is great.  The cast is amazing plus I like the plot.  Good watching on these hot summer days too!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie was hilarious! I loved the first one and was excited for this one to come out<br />And it was worth the wait! Very witty and overall good clean fun!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Great album! Downloaded without a flaw. Another great Amazon experience! Wich I could have known about this back in the day, might have heard more from him with some record sales.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|I appreciate a free game but this is a lot of bright light and flashy things. not sure the point since you get boxed in then die. deleting this game after a quick play that was frustrating at best.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Never, ever could I have predicted the twists and turns in this book.  What a fabulous read.  It's no wonder it's stayed at the top of the NY Times Best Seller list for so long.  You'll think and dream about this one long after you're finished.
0684847817|5.0|The drawings are beautiful, my 7 yo daughter loves them. We are fans of the book, for sure! The fae in this book are so unique that even though we look at the book everyday, we still aren't bored, and are always finding new details. The words are too hard for her yet, so we just discuss what we see.
0810994739|5.0|I bought this for my children to complete their library.  They loved it.  All six have read it, and several have read it more than once.  Great book.  Great story.
B0086700CM|4.0|This app is very fun and very very addicting. Once you start, you can't stop! I also love the achievements you have to unlock. Although, there is one that probably won`t be broke. Playing this game 10000 times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOL
B00APYKXFS|1.0|The graphics are horrible. Enemy ships are the same color as the player ship. The background whatever it is is distracting. There's red blobs floating on the screen you can't shoot them yet you die if you touch them. Something in the settings references gravity but there's no explanation what it does, what it's for you just know you can either use shake or two fingers to.... do something. At least you're offered the option of turning off the terrible background music though the game sound effects aren't much better. Even free this game isn't worth the time to download it. Give this a pass, it's garbage.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|It was very good keeping with most of the facts from the original series.  Which a Star Trek fan would notice but anyone else would not even notice.  Great movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. It's just what I like. If you like thinking games where you need to figure out the clue, then this is the game for you. Can't wait to see more!
B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies offers a unique take on a common 'aliens invade Earth' plot.  It manages to mix the drama and struggles of civilians trying to survive and maintain some semblance of a normal life, and the typical shoot 'em up scenes w/ the aliens that your average sci fi fan wants to see.<br /><br />It draws a lot on history, gorilla warfare, scavenging, ingenuity, etc. that we see in real-world conflicts.  Also, rather than leaving the viewer in the dark on the aliens' motives, this show presents just enough info here and there to clue the audience in on the sometimes bizarre and otherwise unusual desires and ethics of the alien invaders.<br /><br />It's an engaging show all around.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game every needs to buy it . I love it because I can play on my xbox  then go somewhere and then play it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching this show on a whim.  I ended up going on a Downton Abbey marathon and staying up for almost a week to watch it all.  Season Three has quite a few surprises and ended with me crying! I read Season 4 will not air until next January.  That's too long!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|By far one of the best games ive played in a very long time cant put it down all glitches are fixed!!!!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|We have listened to the first 4 books and have enjoyed them all.  We are looking forward the next book and the movie in August.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game to play. very chalanging. easy at first though. would like more room and more clues to make each level last longer. have a great day!
B005723JSQ|5.0|As some mentioned, the story line is a bit predictable, but Kinsella manages to keep the reader intrigued and entertained, as usual. I was not looking for anything more, and I only wish that a sequel would be written to follow Poppy's silly antics while with Sam...and hoping for a movie version!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works like a charm, super fast delivery like always, 5 Stars. Would have been nice to have this included in the Kindle Fire HD original package though.
B007LB5MF4|5.0|Excellent companion to the book and show.  I loved it and look forward to reading the next volume. Have fun
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works great to charge Kindle and to use as a USB cord. I didn't know I could use it as a USB cord when I purchased it for charging my Kindle. Very please with  product. Would recommend it to all.<br /><br />Thank you
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The Pact if a good book although I found the ending to be a little anticlimactic. I have read several J. Picoult novels, and this one is my least favorite.
B000S1M9LY|1.0|this is the largest collection of gobbledegook that I have ever tried to get through. had to give up about five percent. this book(?) would not be worth the money if it was free.those who claim to make any sense at all of this collection of mumbo-jumbo are pulling your leg and are undoubtedly laughing their collective asses off at this very moment.sorry Amazon,you definitely missed the boat with this one.
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|For those of us who are creatives (artists, writers, musicians) and have always operated outside the box, putting our craft/art first no matter what society says we're \\"supposed\\" to be doing, this book is validation...at last.  It turns out we've been doing the right thing all along.  Who knew?  Seth Godin did.<br /><br />For those bored with their careers, weary of being a cog in the system, overwhelmed with how business/marketing/commerce has collapsed in the last five years, Godin offers a way out.  Become a linchpin.  Become the artist of your life and career.<br /><br />But be warned.  The path of the linchpin takes great courage.  You'll be bucking the system.  You'll be operating with heart.  You'll be putting humanity back into the business equation.  You'll be turning your life and career into a work of art.<br /><br />And in the process you'll be making a difference.  You will.  Not only will you bring joy to every business transaction but you'll also achieve the kind of success you've always dreamed of.  Who knew, right?  Seth Godin did.<br /><br />Grab this book and go for it.  It's worth it.  It truly is!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game that poses numerous challenges! Cant wait for new rooms. Be sure to check every corner.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This story bridges the experience of a veteran English seaman with the politics and culture of Japan.  The world was different in the 17th century, but the lessons are surprisingly relevant to today's globalized world.  It's a long book, but you'll find yourself breezing through it as Clavell keeps the story moving and the reader eagerly awaiting the next part of the journey.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Fun and engaging story with references to the classic 80's video games. Great visuals, laughs for kids and parents. Highly recommend this for the whole family.
0451232852|5.0|I just finished Ken Follett's \\"Fall of Giants\\" and loved it. It is an extensively researched historical novel covering the period from just before World War I to just after. It covers five families spanning from Russia to  Germany to Wales and America. It covers not just World War I but also the Russian Revolution and Woman's Suffrage with subplots involving a rapidly changing society including an unraveling Edwardian society in England. (Not all country gentleman were as nice as Lord Grantham in Downton Abbey.)<br /><br />The characters are strong, believable and most important for guys like me they are different from one another. There is Earl Fitzherbert who owns a bunch of land, much of which, is underlain by coal from which he earns a fortune of royalty by others mining it. His Earlness likes to take advantage of the female help in the house and rather resents it when they are so rude as to get pregnant.  His sister Maud, an outspoken advocate for woman's suffrage and others.<br /><br />The book is HUGE but moves along very rapidly has just about anything you want, romance, horrific war scenes, rousing labor union speeches, hangings of cheeky Russian peasants, firing squads, glamorous dinner parties, starvation, good sex scenes, bad sex scenes, international intrigue and spying. This book has it all.<br /><br />Follett makes the whole thing hang together with some great writing. I loved this book. Get it, read it.<br /><br />The book is expensive, $30for the hardback, $20 for the Kindle version. Check your library. I got mine downloaded on my Kindle from our local library for free. It was supposed to self destruct after two weeks but it didn't.<br /><br />The sequel \\"Winter of the World\\" came out last September. You can bet that I'm reading it. I'm thinking I might even spring for the $20 for the Kindle version.<br /><br />Five stars out of five for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is pretty great, especially if you need to work on things like hand-eye coordination or fine motor skills...all while having an awesome time. I'm pretty competitive, so even the hard games keep me plugging away!
0670014893|5.0|A Delicate Truth is truly a thriller. It is about a joint American-British military-private industry anti-terror operation in Gibralter and the aftermath years later. I'm not going to spoil a thing about it except to say that this book is LeCarre at his best. The villains are truly banal, the heroes are trying to do the right thing but don't exactly know what to do.<br /><br />This book has a trailer. It gives a pretty good idea about the book.<br /><br />This book is seriously good. I give it five stars out of five. Get it at the library. I'm a slow reader but I tore through this one in a matter of hours. Get it, read it, try and put it down.
4789009637|5.0|My daughter is using this for her AP Japanese class.  She previously used Irasshai and this book covers the language much better.  It moves away from romaji a lot sooner than the other book that she had.  She loves it!
0062255657|5.0|How did I not know about Neil Gaiman?  This is the first book of his I've read based on a recommendation.  The book was sensitive and eerie, not like anything I've read before. The story is engrossing, I had a hard time putting it down.  It was both endearing and creepy at the same time.  The characters were well developed.  I'll be reading more from Mr. Gaiman, that's for sure.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Long, odd and disturbing, but unlike anything else I have ever read. It is thought provoking so I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind wading theough something to stimulate their mind.
1609611543|4.0|Saw the author on Dr. Oz - made a lot of sense - trying to put it into my life.  As always, Amazon has what I am looking for.  Thank you.<br /><br />Lorna
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I was skeptical at first as to wether or not I would like Hannibal. Then I watched the pilot. I was shocked that something so darkly beautiful, intelligent, and violent could exist on network television. The cinematography is stunning, the writing is brilliant, and the acting is so spot on I get chills. This show has elevated itself from pop culture to high art. Please watch this show so it doesn't get cancelled. We need shows like this to offset Dancing with the Stars.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|On my kindle this app doesn't work AT ALL. Whenever I press on a video it says, &quot;Vtube has stopped working.&quot; It annoys me SO much when I can't get a simple 1:30 video to play. This is why I give this app 1/5 stars
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Definitely one of the finest apps I've gotten for Android. Definitely great casual fun, I really hope they make more levels (or at least a new testament, lol).
B00AFYZDL2|4.0|Been a Saxon fan for a LONG time. This disc is a middle of the road effort for them, which is still better than a lot of bands ever do. The remake of Crusader is EPIC, and some of the new tracks are strong on their own. Buy it if you're a fan.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|There are probably not enough words available to put into spacial elements of how truly wonderful this book is. It's a book that will have you laughing and crying at the same time, and bring you into the very real world of young people, dealing with something, no young person should need or have to experience. These characters are so well-thought out, that I feel if I were a teen dealing with such tribulations, I feel as though, Id probably have the same aspects and views. Hazel & Gus' story is so moving and guttural that I felt like if their story was told in any other way, or shown in any other light that it would not do enough justice to who they were, it would feel wrong. I feel as though, we shouldn't take what we have for granted, and even though these kids were sick, they made the best of what they had, which so often, we forget to do. I adored this book and anyone that knows about living should read this book to get a refreshing view on dying and on love.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|I love this band and was a little let down with their second album. This album is a much stronger effort and really is also a great recording. The step up to a really good studio made a big difference and they took their time getting it right. It shows from the opening vocals to the last cymbal crash. You won't be disappointed.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|Unistalled after 1 day. Controls are unintuitive, difficult to see interior cube drop after one layer is created, slow and, ultimately, frustrating.
B00AW8VUDG|5.0|Strongest effort from them in YEARS. Several great songs and no clunkers. Buy it now, crank it up, and thank me later.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book couldn't have been released at a better time for me. I'm currently going through problems at my job that really had me down. Then I read this book and I felt a lot better. It gave me options and made me think about a way out. I'm done working for people whom I think are unqualified for their positions. I'm tired of begging for my livelihood. I'm choosing myself.<br /><br />That's what this entire book is about. To summarize, the author goes through how everything we believed in such as college, retirement plans, and job security are all a bunch of lies that will be done away with in the next few decades. To remain relevant, happy and healthy, one must use their own ideas to move forward. To use the title of the book, you must choose yourself.<br /><br />If you're feeling like you're stuck in your life and you're not getting anywhere, I recommend reading this book. It was quick, interesting and inspirational.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Very good movie based on the true story. Would watch it again. Lots of big waves and a great story about a true surfer.
B00CFOGCAG|4.0|Great game, extremely fun, simple and yet strategic but where's the share to Google+ option in the share after a game?  I knows it exists because my brother has the game and he shares to google+ but he got the Google play version.  I know it's not my phone since it's also missing on my tablet. Is it an amazon thing? All I got is email related options.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This film demonstrated the love between a man and a dog - anyone considering taking on a pet should see this film.

B004856SQ8|4.0|If your an action adventure fan, you should love it, it's got plenty. The action is non stop with a few good laughs along the way.  Liam Neeson heads a great cast.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much a first it was hard but then it started getting easy so I kept playing and playing I played all night I think this is a great game to play.
B004HO6HWK|4.0|This movie almost got bye me. But being an action/adventure fan, and a big Jason Statham fan I picked it up. I was not the slightest bit disappointed. I've enjoyed the action in most all of Jason's movies, but found they come up a little short on the story end. This movie delivers on both ends.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love each level but I put smarter them! Keep the levels coming! An  make them harder! Peeps should make more apps like this.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|A very well told story of the battle that turned the war in favor of the north. Well acted from top to bottom.

B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is the best. There is lava and water buckets and now there is pumkins.and can you guys please add withers.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|As I get older, watch my daughter grow up, watch the world transform yet remain ever the same, I find myself becoming more tolerant of some things and less of others.  I have very little patience with ignorant people--you know, the ones who can't identify the Vice President or the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court but can tell you who a Kardashian is in an instant.  I question what I was told as a child was \\"normal\\" because I've come to find that \\"normal\\" is a subjective thing.  And I find many things to be acceptable to me now that weren't supposed to be all those years ago.<br /><br />\\"From Beginning to End\\" is a thought-provoking film.  It is beautifully filmed, with natural and artificial light illuminating the screen and all the lovely actors upon it.  As other people have said, the narrative has a fairytale quality to it, with all the characters portrayed as good and kind people.  In fact, there is very little conflict between any of the characters here.  They are content.  And accepting, it seems, because the heart of this story is about two half-brothers who share a passionate, sexual, loving relationship that nobody in the film blinks twice about.  From their parents, to their swim coach, to a female acquaintance from a night club, the viewer can sense that these people are all aware of the controversial bond between the brothers, but leave it be, perhaps because they know their interference won't change it, or because they realize the relationship actually isn't any of their business and is hurting no one.<br /><br />And THAT'S how I ended up feeling about Francisco and Tomas.  I found myself accepting of this taboo relationship because I felt their love so STRONGLY, because they were hurting no one, and because unlike brother/sister incest, there was no possibility of procreation.  I don't know.  The who thing just did NOT bother me.  And as for the gay thing?  So what.  I'm so far past that.  You can't help who you are sexually attracted to or who you fall in love with.  As long as you are consenting adults, it's nobody's business but your own.  Love is a gift, after all.  True unconditional love is far more rare than we realize.  That's what Tomas explains in the movie.  As the narrator, he let's us know that when a certain character dies, he and Francisco realize that life is fleeting so to deny their chance at love would be the wrong choice.  They were meant to be together.  Soul mates if ever there were ones.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie.  Likely because the two male leads were combustible on screen.  I mean, seriously scorching.  Their chemistry was so amazing, I never once thought they were acting.  They felt real and genuine together.  And I fell in love with them as they fell in love with each other.  When an event separates them, and you watch Francisco, especially, falling apart over his longing for Tomas, all I could do was hope that they'd find a way back together before he emotionally imploded.<br /><br />Top notch film worth watching.

0143119680|3.0|Dan Brown meets the Twilight Series.  I'm not sure I'll make it through all the books in the trilogy, but it is a good summer read if you don't want to have to think too hard.  It hits all the supernatural cliches while trying to add its own twist (not always successfully). If only the writing were better.....
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Impossible to put down.  I am writing my own second novel, and Reflected In You provided exciting diversion at the end of each day.  Not many days, mind you!  Onto book 3...
0525952926|5.0|I have not yet completed the book - about one-quarter through it. I admire Ken Follett's research in his writing.  Always holds my interest.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Entwined with You continues the drama and the many erotic love scenes, some reaching a crescendo and some still leaving us expectant.  I sympathise with Sylvia Day's need to insert background information for readers who might not have read the earlier books in the series, and balancing it with avoiding repetition for those who are following the series.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Don't waste your time. I wasted the better part of 2 hours trying to get this to download.  The file is too big for 1st gen Fires and even if you can get the file to download It locks up on you once you do. what's the point of making this available for Kindle Fire users if doesn't even work? Painfully disappointing... and totally LAME.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Hard not to compare to 50 Shades, Gideon and Eva are more believable than Christian and Ana.  As a sufferer of mental illness, this series is inclusive and kind, and gives me hope!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was an awesome game.  It kept my attention, was challenging, but not impossible, and was downright FUN!  I highly recommend it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game for horse lover's. I have been wanting a horse for a year now and this is a great game for getting you started and pursuading your parents into getting you one

B001I9WK14|5.0|Amazing. Perfect example of pre ZooTv U2. It has all the good old songs and since its a concert movie you can see how great they were before all the media.
B00124BNF4|4.0|I remembered some of the classics on this from my youth, but with the entire collection I am finding some that I missed. Nothing like discovering something new while being around something old.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|Something about Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros just makes me happy.  The songs are lyrical, the band reminds me of old Medieval troubadours meets Woodstock.  They're style is hard to pinpoint, but mixes alternative rock, with folk, horns, percussion, and poetry.  Both albums are extremely good.
B00973DDN2|4.0|Honestly? I only bought it for the name of the album as I had never heard of this band before, I was surprised that most of the songs were actually pretty good.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|My brother and i have loved the old purple from the 70's..from the original line up to Coverdale/Hughes days. Got a say this is pretty enjoyable and refreshing. Miss Blackmore, but Morse does a great job. Lord is gone, but you won't recognize it...keyboards kick ass. Ian's voice sounds good...and Paice drums sound tight.........its a good cd..not dissapointed..thanks
B000W15AQ6|4.0|To me Eminem is a musical genius, but one that can only be appreciated in small bites. This album contains some of the best compositions of the artist and is something you just want to crank going down the Interstate at 90 miles an hour in the middle of the night.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|Any true superman fan must have this collection. Not only are you getting the classics, but also bonus content that will complement whatever knowledge you have about superman's origins and more.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Don;t expect blockbuster, but for what it was I was happy with the movie. Franco has become as one note as Nic Cage, but everyone else in the movie was a joy to see. For an origin story of sorts it worked nicely and almost had me looking for the classic to see how the story fits. Rent for a night, you won't be sorry.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|the schwartz is strong with this one
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Don't blame RDJ for sequelitis. While not as good as the original it still is one rocking Summer movie that introduces new material in the cinematic Marvel Universe. Plus you get War Machine, so it has that going for it.
B00BTHWFBK|1.0|Having been a fan since the mid 70's I was really excited about the release of this CD. The music is excellent but the lyrics are just awful....Comeon Geezer ....GimmeaBreak!!!  ....I had to read the lyrics to verify that they were as assinine as what I had just listened to ....Needless to say I THREW IT RIGHT IN THE GARBAGE...
B005KMDTKQ|5.0|I first was exposed to Ray during his stint with Genesis and since then have really become a fan. This set is incredible as it melds together the two eras of his life and shows the range he is capable of. He should be much more well known then he is. If you are Genesis fan and don't have this, shame on you.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I love all of these books and movies. So this one was a little bloody, but so what. I knew it was coming and it was only a movie! Hate that there is only one more! So sad!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|If you're one of those people who contemplate while watching COPS, how many different ways are there to execute a search warrant? you'll enjoy watching a diverse group of people who address questions that really matter.  TED Conferences is much more enlightening than watching any episode of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo on The Learning Channel.<br /><br />Clearly, each presentation is designed to educate mankind, rather than exploit for the purpose of entertainment. The applause are genuine, and no one is chanting, Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!!!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is a very useful tool, considering I spend most of my time outside or on the road right now, so I NEED to know just how fast I'm running out of battery life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Found game to be enjoyable and challenging at the same time..need more levels..went through the levels fairly quick. My 12year-old Granddaughter enjoys it also, people of all ages can enjoy I this game.
B007X4ECMI|1.0|the movie didn't work at all play it in all my players and computers didn't work at all i hate it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was suspenseful and exciting. If you liked Doors and games like that<br />you will definitely Love this game wish it was longer! Can't wait to play another one made by them!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Looking forward to next season.  I love the  characters and story line, but hated the ending of this season's story.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I installed this game to my Kindle Fire HD. Loved the game, but at level 25, it started to lock up and crash or not connect to server. I talked to customer service and they said that Kindles don't have enough resources to play the game at the higher levels. It's too bad because it really is a fun game.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|Grandkids requested I rent it and we loved it.  They were here for long weekend and we watched several times.
B00AEFXUL2|4.0|This is an entertaining but fairly predictable western directed by Howard Hawkes. Gunslinger Cole Thornton (John Wayne) rides into town to meet with rancher Bart Jason (Edward Asner). On the way he meets up with an old friend of his, J.P. Harrah (Robert Mitchum) who is now sheriff of El Dorado. Harrah tells Thornton that Jason is trying to drive another rancher, Kevin Macdonald (R.G. Armstrong), off his ranch so that he can get hold of more land. Thornton decides not to work for Jason but accidentally kills one of Macdonald's sons. In return, Macdonald's daughter, Josephine (Michele Carey), shoots Thornton and leaves him with a debilitating injury. Some months later, Thornton meets up with another man, Mississippi (James Caan), who is also intent up avenging the death of his friend. Jason has hired another gunslinger, Nelse McLeod (Christopher George), to fight his battles. There are various twists and turns in the story which goes pretty much to plan, but it's good entertainment if you like westerns.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My ten year old daughter says this game is fun. She would recommend it for kids from six to twelve. My son who is thirteen did not like it. My husband and I did not like it either.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|I enjoy the music from the movie, and this cd will be something I can listen to while driving around town.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Loved the movie, but was very disappointed with the &#34;end&#34;.  I had read the book prior to watching this movie, unfortunately the end of the movie seems to leave you hanging.  However, I have watched it several times and will watch it again.
B009O07NMA|3.0|FGL debut comes on strong with a new Alt Country sound, but after multiple replays, the bombastic top 40 commercial country twang/rock/rap sounds are wearing me down, and FGL is out of my rotation. Is FGL the new Kid Rock of Country?  So what is next?  Country Lean or mainstream/rock/rap/..abbess. I am interested to find out the direction of the next album.<br /><br />Every dog has its day. Or .....New Kid in town?
B00AF6B22E|2.0|Was very disappointed in the role Denzel Washington played.  Although I realize he is an actor, I think his part sucked and I NEVER would have believed his character...just didn't fit for him.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game really makes you think. Great exercise for your brain.<br />Great way to enhance your critical thinking and problem solving skills.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I loved this book. The way it is written keeps it interesting and keeps you on your toes. Can't wait to read the next book in the series!
B00BP29SAA|4.0|This is a fun app. I just wish you could do more with the grocery shopping and the puzzles, but it is entertaining.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I got this because I like the application on my PC.  It seems to be very similar in functionality.  I really like the radar photos of rain.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|The Keepsake edition with he beautiful photos and the extra Special Features DVD make this collection well worth the money.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Tangled is NOT your traditional romance novel. It's written from a guy's perspective. Female readers may or may not like that fact. Guys can be jerks and the hero is no different. He has his moment's. The story is honest and crude, genuine and funny. Definitely a must read, so long as you are not shy about harsh language and extensive sexual content.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|In my opinion Downton Abbey  deserves 5 star rating. Truly worth watching. I loved it as soon as I started watching from season one. I can't wait for season 4 !
B002ADYFJC|5.0|A very unique perspective of the Arthurian legend told from the viewpoint of Arthur's half sister, Morgaine.  Beautifully written and captivating.  A movie was made of this book that does not do it justice.  I would highly recommend this book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was a slog to finish.<br /><br />The email dialog was esp boring<br /><br />The last page: \\"I fell on the bed with my shoes still on\\" that sums it up!
B0084AXZK0|2.0|Different to what i wasexpecting. But i still enjoyed it, a most interesting close study i think against society. Maybe
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a really great show. I watch all three seasons in one week. At least the first part of the third season.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|this show is so fabulous. every single facet. the cinematography and set design in particular are so, so excellent--the palette is rich and emotive and i cry and my tears are golden globes. best thing on television at the moment (perhaps with the exception of game of thrones).
B0091REZMW|4.0|very good a little confusing on navigating through the rooms but am sure I will get the hang of it as the game goes on
B00280LYHS|5.0|To all those young Percy Jackson readers out there, Rick Riordan definitely saved the best for last. This action packed showstopper is perfect for kids and adults under sixty.
B0053O89JM|5.0|House was a great show throughout and the last season was just as good as the  first.  It had a fitting ending for the characters and they kept challenging you to re evaluate what you would do in their circumstance.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Rihanna did it again! I absolutely LOVE this CD, The photography is kinda weird, but the music is amazing! The DVD was a great addition! Thank you for sharing your artistry!
1432794426|5.0|When I started to read this book, I was entranced by the almost poetic writing style of Dr. Karen Moriarty.<br />The book is thematically well jointed, it opens a new perception about Michael Jackson and is very well investigated with provable facts. It is written warmheated and deferentially.<br />An absolutely MUST for all MJ-fans! They will love it!<br />But this work should be read also by the non-fans, because it opens an unique possibility to get to know who was the \\"real Michael Jackson\\". Finally the prejudices, defamation and lies about this unique awesome person has to stop! Michael Jackson was surely the biggest entertainer and humanist on earth. It is unbelievable, how badly he was treated. He gave everything to the world what a person can give: He created unforgettable compositions and music, he defined the dance style for all next generations, he helped the poor and he loved the children.<br />Karen Moriarty describes all these facts in her book. She takes up exactly this topic. It is a very intelligent, sensitive and literary work. This book should be translated into other languages!
030789701X|5.0|An excellent and voluminous guide book for Skyrim. It's very thorough covering the original game and all the downloadable content except Hearthfire which doesn't really need it anyway. The quality of the binding is top notch and the pages throughout are beautifully done. Highly recommended.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Cloud Atlas, which alternates between six different time periods at an increasing rate throughout the movie, is one of those things that you think can never work, but then you come to see that it does, magnificently. It goes through several phases. First the setting up of each scenario: in the 1840s on the high seas, in the 1930s in Europe, in the 1970s in California, present-day England, a couple centuries hence in \\"Neo-Seoul\\", and a in primitive setting (initially) far in the future. In the first phase you start out confused, don't see how there can be any relation between the scenarios, and brace for two and a half hours of disappointment. But then, slowly, themes repeat, and it starts to come together. We fully enter the new phase where the scenario shifts start to occur much more quickly, and they are clever: each scene dovetails into the next from another time with a similar situation, or word or phrase, or theme, or physical location. Then all six stories start to reach their climaxes, and the time-switching switches into high gear. Here there's a lot of Wachowski-trademarked intense violence (although no slow-fast motion martial arts, a la The Matrix (well, close, in Neo-Seoul (get it? Neo?))). And then the denouements reveal the overall theme, which I will not attempt to summarize, and it becomes crystal clear. And it's beautiful. Cloud Atlas is probably a new entry into my top ten favorite movies of all time.
B003SHYVO8|4.0|A fun, breezy entry in the Step Up series. These movies aren't revolutionary, but they are good entertainment and a fun way to spend an evening.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|The game itself is a solid, top down shooter in the style of Galaga, more specifically the 'bullet hell' subgenre. From what I played of the &quot;60 Second&quot; boss mode, the controls were responsive, though the visuals were rather bland. The soundtrack was a hodge podge of electronic music, mostly trance, and the lack of invasive permissions is a plus.<br /><br />My 1 star rating comes from the game completely force closing when normal mode is selected, as well as at the end of the boss mode round. If fixed, though, the game would merit a higher rating, and a playthrough by fans of the genre. (Droid RAZR)
B00APYKXFS|3.0|Well that was... interesting. Graphics are pretty good but no instructions and the gameplay is sort of chaos.  I would recommend increasing screen size in options, as it is set to 85% by default and there is a lot going on (on a phone anyway, even a big phone looks cluttered with that setting... tablet probably ok). Moving around is easy enough to figure out but avoiding the red and collecting the yellow? Not sure exactly what's goin on, why I don't die is more surprising than why I do.  As a free game... 3 stars. As a paid game... Only 2.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|It was ok. Not really worth buying but it's not like I want my money back. This book felt like it was an attempt to set up the next book. I am also upset that it build a character just to drop them like they where never part of the story!
B00006I53S|5.0|This is my new Walking Around lens.  Images are sharp, focus is quick, and the lens is fairly lightweight.  Highly recommended!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|non stop fun. if you are bored this will keep you entertained.  constantly making you think<br />. I wish I had this app on my phone
B0037QM8YA|3.0|2 dark and depressing 4 me.  I already grew up in a household like that in this movie and don't want 2 b reminded.  Not an entertaining movie.  I only liked the flashback parts when precious was fantasizing.
B0007CYW5A|1.0|Plugged the new battery into the Sony charger and it would not accept a charge, just blinked &#34;WARNING&#34; on the charger display.<br />Sony should QA the batteries before they provide them to Amazon for resale.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great read, cant wait for the next one. What a beautiful love story. So many obstacles but they never give up. Loved it.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|It played well on a little clear connect gizmo operating at about .6 Mbs (that's a point 6) Go Amazon.
B007SGM084|5.0|Despite the fact that everyone who talks about this book talk about the dirty part of it I was delighted with the love story behind it
B000VNMMQQ|3.0|This movie was decent for a Die Hard movie and you get what you expect. The Subtitles were horrible though and whoever did them should move on to other things.<br /><br />I have all the Die Hard films so I have enjoyed the series. But in all honesty it is time for the series to end. Bruce Willis is still a fine actor but his talent needs to be focused on other projects in the future.<br /><br />If you are a Die Hard fan buy it, if you are not it is just another Action Film that is good but not great.

B00CISC244|5.0|I feel like Boards of Canada, like most musicians with more uniquely specific artistic goals, have only been getting better and better. I believe that they have increased their level of musical sophistication and subtlety with each album they've put out, and this one is a real treat for their true believer fans. It's extremely dark and bleak, but without the playful lining present on their other darker album, Geogaddi.<br /><br />The drum beats and rhythms are in general masterful on the album, they spent alot of time on this obviously and it shows. There are also several completely ambient works on the album, my favorite being Transmisiones Ferox, I really like the transition about halfway through the piece. There are several catchy somewhat upbeat songs as well, such as New Seeds and Cold Earth.<br /><br />That being said there is a feeling of unease throughout the whole record, and although it's a very unique and well crafted tension it can be a turn off to folks who aren't already fans. Alot of music folks think that BoC peaked with &#34;Music has the Right to Children&#34;, and I disagree because II feel they've objectively advanced their music making abilities, but their old music was more culturally relevant. It is a pity that this music for the apocalypse may not appeal to a wider audience, but it's an absolutely fantastic work of art regardless.

B00000JLWW|5.0|Finally, after a long time, my \\"TITANIC\\" DVD arrived safely, and in good conditions. Just as I expected.<br />There were a few problems/delays, due to the way the \\"traditional\\" postal service works but, thankfully, all the problems had been solved.<br />What else to say? Well, a movie like \\"TITANIC\\" doesn't need any special reviews/comments, as everyone knows what a masterpiece this movie had been, and how it changed so much the movie history.<br />What I like to say, though, about this DVD edition (the first Paramount's 1999 \\"now out-of-print\\", non-anamorphic, single disc edition) is that, unlike all the re-releases, special editions, remastered editions, that had been coming out in this last decade, this DVD release, besides the old Dolby Digital/DTS Laserdisc editions, is the only DVD edition to contain the \\"unaltered\\" original theatrical Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, as was heard by many people back in 1997/1998.<br />Forget about the Blu-Ray DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix, or the PCM mix you heard at the 3D re-release screening of the movie. Those are all remastered/post-edited mixes of the original.<br />Every single detail, effect, and depth is all here, in this Dolby Digital mix. The dialogues are crystal clear, the beautiful James Horner music spread out throughout the soundfield, making an enveloping rich experience, and every single cracking wall, crack, during the sinking of the ship, is horrifying, specially when the ship falls down deep in the abyss. You clearly hear every single piece falling down.<br />That said, if you're looking to re-experience \\"TITANIC\\" in all its glory, as you experienced back in 1997/1998, then get this DVD (or the Dolby/DTS Laserdisc edition, if you have the player).

B001NLL93W|4.0|A nice ending to the \\"first\\" Mortal Instruments trilogy, but this one is a bit heavier on plot and less focused on the fun \\"His Girl Friday\\" style snappy dialogue and crazy pop culture references. Almost knocked it down to 3 stars, but the characters (except for Jace, who is growing to be genuinely emo and irritating) are still great and with following into the next book.
B00APYKXFS|2.0|I'm glad this is free. It isn't really worth 99 cents. The lasers are pretty much undodgeable and follow your ship which make no sense. You die every few seconds and don't even realise it until it says game over. And if you really have the time to, you can just keep pressing continue and reach some super high level. Add upgrades, make it less fast pace and flashy, and fix the interface or something. This game needs a lot of work before being worth 99 cents.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was a beautiful story. I cried and laughed. It's like all the other books in the series. Just wonderful!

B005MHHREI|4.0|This tome reveals in sometimes mind numbing detail the events and political intrigue that surrounded Mao's entire life.  I grew up during Mao's rule of the PRC and absorbed much of the propaganda related to his being a man of the people and defender of the peasant.  I was too young to know anything about the Great Leap Forward, but was taught that he was a brilliant military tactician. I saw the Cultural Revolution from the outside, which seemed extreme, but presumably well-intentioned.  This book blows away all western consensus views of Mao's image and reveals him to be the undisputed largest mass murderer in all history, surpassing even Stalin.  Obviously, the truth of many of these events are very difficult to verify, but they are consistent with anecdotal stories that I have heard from people that used to live in the PRC and with more recent historical accounts by others.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book; I thought it was original, compelling, lyrical. After I read this book, I wanted to read everything available by this author, and was disappointed to find that that isn't much on Kindle. Jojo Moyes is a prolific writer, but in the US, we are very limited to what we can purchase on Kindle. Immediately after reading this book, I purchased the Last Letter from Your Lover (the only other Kindle edition available at that time), which I enjoyed just as much. I'm hoping that more of her books become available on Kindle; I tried listening to Night Music on Audible, but Jojo Moyes' writing is just so beautiful, that a lot got lost by just listening to it; I ended up purchasing a paperback copy of the book so I could really appreciate what I was missing. That in itself says a lot about how much I LOVE this author, as I mostly just like to read books on my Kindle. So far I have pre-ordered everything that has become available on Kindle and I'm hoping we can soon access all of her books in the US; she is THAT good.

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I thought this was a fantastic movie. I had action and humor. The actors did a great job, and i thought is was just very well done. I love how the Marvel universe is weaving all these movies and storylines together, but this one is my favorite.

The Capital is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and girl between ages twelve 2 eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live T.V. 16 year old Katniss Everdeen regards it as death sentence when she steps forward to take her sisters place in the games.

030789701X|5.0|This book is an invaluable resource for Skyrim. It isn't necessary if you're comfortable and familiar with the game, but if you're a new player, or need some tips and advice it is an outstanding tool to have. Also  if you're just an avid fan of the game, it's a huge, beautiful book that would go well with  your collection. Great buy.

B00CATSONE|5.0|The book was more about not giving up on yourself by using past examples of Great minds like Tesla. It also covered some history behind the Great mind of Tesla, his inventions, and how he didn't give up when things were bad.

B004X4R3FE|5.0|I love this movie. It's a very gentle story -- no cars blow up and nobody gets shot in the head. The characters are well drawn, the plot provides tension and release in all the right places. It sounds funny, I suppose, but I envy the cast and crew to have had the opportunity to work on such a great project.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Though, at times, hard to follow, the farther one gets into the story the place of each character becomes clearer.  The power of family for good and for evil is portrayed. The  changes  which occur in the homeland over time are  sad,  but the strength  of honestly described relationships  perseveres and your emotions are captured.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Plot is so good!  Hard to stop watching after first program. I do love it!  Characters are so convincing in their roles...well cast.

B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|Solar, the Miles Davis classic, is preseeded by an emorphous avant garde series of sounds, and the theme comes out of nowhere. The tune is taken  apart and put back together again in many ways. Just great imagination with all the musical elements.<br />The Stars Fell on Alabama, I relate to the Cannonball Adderley take, wonderful feel and sense of a look forward.<br />Somewhere is a tour de force using repetition to remind of the trance like state established in the Koln Concert, very powerful.<br />Tonight is Jarrett an the trio just straight swinging hard.<br />Both Devil and I thought about you make you close you eyes and forget where you are.<br />Don't wait, go out and buy today!

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I'm a big fan of superhero movies, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Man of Steel, Captain America, etc.  These are meant to be popcorn movies enjoyed on the big screen.  The Avengers did not disappoint, in fact I own the blu-ray.  I just wanted to see what the quality was like streaming through Amazon Instant.  I have to say, it's pretty good but of course not as good as the blu-ray.  I streamed it on my Kindle Fire HD, HDTV through my Roku 2 XS and also on my MacBook Pro 13 (not the retina display) and it looked good for the most part.  Overall, the movie was average when it comes to story line.  Gotta love all the great one-liners by Robert Downey, Jr who really makes the movie with his charm and wit.
B000001DVD|5.0|This is about as good as it gets from Def Leppard. Not too raw like the first one and not too polished like Pyromania and far before the downward spiral of Hysteria and onward. Not one bad song in the bunch and Joe Elliot is incredible throughout. A must have for any classic rock or metal fan!
0345536886|5.0|I purchased the book for my son and he said he loves it. Part of our summer reading at home
B007I2BZIE|3.0|After repeated listens after not liking this at first I was compelled to write a five star review. Now that my emotions have calmed down and I've given it some more spins I have to drop my rating to three point five  stars. I can admit when I am wrong. The main problem here is the muddy sound. This actually sounds ok on headphones but not by good in my car on a high end system. I shouldn't have to tinker with settings to get something to sound right. There is some solid music here and some excellent song writing but the over compression is really a big negative causing all of the sounds to just blend together. The best songs: Headlong Flight, The Wreckers, The Garden, The Anarchist,  and Seven Cities of Gold. This had potential to be something special.  I am not one that usually criticizes he modern production techniques and even though I think the loudness war sucks  I can live with it on most releases. They should re-release this. When meausred against all of the other Rush classics this gets three point five stars at best.<br /><br />EDIT: I wanted to mention that I did pick up the vinyl and it sounds far better than the Cd version to my ears. Much more separation in the instruments and not as fatiguing to listen to. I still think my biggest complaint with this whole production is Geddy's singing. I would have preferred at least two or three instrumentals like Sankes had. Still some solid tracks here and worth picking up for any Rush fan but this is NOT \\"the BEST thing they ever released!!\\"
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Love the music, the genuine a sap (In-Game TF2 Item) and Dota 2. This is a great product and it comes with a little portal comic.
B000001F7R|4.0|This is as raw as it gets for Def Leppard which is not necessarily a bad thing. I would rate High and Dry slightly above this one for the overall production but this is still filled with classics and the great young voice of Joe Elliot. Definitively a must own in any serious metal or rock collection!
B0064MGU98|4.0|Thought this was a very good series.  I enjoy the court room drama and I like the cast.  I always look forward to the next case.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|My son had told me about Clutch. I watched a couple of thier YouTube Videos, but, never pursued purchasing any of their CDs. I was browsing,and, I saw Earth Rocker, previewed it,purchased it, and it blew me away. Clutch is a GREAT Rock n' Roll band. I liked this so much that I have now purchased all of Clutchs' CDs. I am 68 yrs old, and a ROCKER from way back(at the beginning). If there is anyone out there who doesn't like Clutchs' music , they must be DEAF!!!!!!!!!!!! Even Bonafide Country music loving Rednecks will like tyhis one!  NUFF SAID!!!!!!!!!!!  Keep the faith, and, keep on ROCKIN!!!!!!!!!!!
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I greatly enjoyed reading &#34;Chocolat&#34;. I love the movie, but I was not expecting the book to be so closely followed. Usually I prefer to read the book first, then see the movie. In this case, I must admit that I am happy to have done both, in whatever order. Whether you have seen the movie or not, you should read this excellent book. Then you should watch the movie. This is going in my list of favorites, to be re-read, and savored, over and over.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|This book should be required reading.I've read it a few times now, and taken away something new each time. I could wax philosophical about Watchmen forever, but instead will simply say that Alan Moore is a chameleon of writing styles and a master of phrasing.
1250012570|5.0|Source: Received an e-ARC via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />It is still blowing my mind that this is technically a historical fiction novel since it is set in 1986 (I wasn't even alive then!) But that is mostly because I am struggling to put down in words just how much I loved this book.<br /><br />On the surface, not much happens. Eleanor meets Park under less than auspicious circumstances: she's a new student on the bus and doesn't have a seat. He begrudgingly moves over. Soon they're bonding over comics and music and falling in love. But Eleanor's home life is a mess and the course of true love never did run smooth.<br /><br />Just as Eleanor and Park are not immediately friends, this book and I did not immediately click. I was just very skeptical despite having seen several glowing reviews. But both Park and I were soon won over by Eleanor-her frankness, her kindness, her commitment to being herself. Soon we the reader get more insight into Eleanor's crappy home (her divorced mother married an abusive alcoholic man and Eleanor was estranged from them for a year after upsetting the husband; she also has four younger siblings making for a chaotic house. Meanwhile her father is incredibly selfish and thoughtless.) Park seems to have the perfect life with two parents who are still madly in love and a younger brother but deals with his own burdens: a father who doesn't think he's masculine enough and racism as he is half-Korean and looks it.<br /><br />There's a lot of ground to cover and I thought Rowell handled the pacing well. The narration alternates between Park and Eleanor, which allowed me to bond with each of them as I journeyed through their story.  I was particularly interested in the music described and I bet this book would be a kick for anyone who was a teenager then, bringing back some fond memories.<br /><br />The parts that I thought were exceptionally well-done were the descriptions of the physical interactions between Eleanor and Park. I've read a good amount of romance and other adult books as well as pretty extensively in the YA category and no book in recent memory has done such a good job of evoking the feelings and sensations of first love/young love. Just holding hands sends the pair waxing rhapsodic and had me frantically flipping the pages for more.<br /><br />I know I gave this book a perfect 5 and I stand by that rating but my one complaint would be that the ending is a bit ambiguous for my taste. I'm sure some readers really appreciated that since it is realistic and thus fitting for the genre but I like all the little pieces tied up in the bow and one important piece was not as resolved as I wanted although it is leaning in that direction.<br /><br />As I wrote this, I ended up hugging my nook because it held the e-copy of this book. I can't wait to have an actual hard copy to hold. Highly recommended!r and Park.

0307950689|1.0|First off, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE fan of the Da Vinci Code. So, like thousand of others, I was thrilled to read Dan Brown's third novel involving Robert Langdon. Let me just tell ya...this book was a TERRIBLE follow up.<br />This book started out promising, exact same formula as DVC. It wasn't until the middle of the novel that I became completely uninterested. The beginning was OK, but still held my interest. The middle & end.....Complete CRAP! This book's plot was all over the place & there are too many flashback scenes with characters that you don't even care about! Without the pointless flashbacks & POINTLESS explanations/tangents, it would've been 200 pages instead of 500; I probably would've liked it better. I still have no idea what the central theme of this book is! The ending was COMPLETELY lame & such a LET DOWN! The ending was not only beyond stupid, but I ended up w. more questions than answers. I can't believe the people who actually gave it 5 stars! It seems they have fallen under the Dan Brown spell of interesting conspiracy theories. Considering the DVC was published in 2003 & The Lost Symbol in 2009....I feel that 6 years is enough time to write a DECENT novel...not this piece of embarrassment. After DVC, Brown has just gone down hill. He had a hit w. Angels & Demons & DVC...but that's it. This novel not only made me laugh, but it pissed me off at how stupid the entire book was.<br />If you're thinking of reading this....trust me, DON'T! Save yourself time & Wiki the plot if you want to read it THAT bad. Read Da Vinci Code instead.

Every single one has a different design and each suit has a different art style, from 8 bit original to Skyward Sword. The cards are a little light and sort of hard to shuffle at first, but that's the smallest of minor complaints. It's a must-have for Zelda lovers, collectors, and card players a like! :D

1611761441|3.0|I have seen the film version of The Running Man a few times over the course of my life and have always kind of enjoyed watching it.  It's just a good old-fashioned action flick with plenty of excitement and explosions and things of that nature.  I had always wanted to read the original novel by Richard Bachman but just never got around to it, until recently when I came across it in Blackstone's online catalog.<br /><br />It became clear right away that the novel was going to be a lot different than the film.  I don't mind that so much in general.  Films are always different than the novel because you can only do so much on screen.  In the film, Ben Richards is a white cop who was forced to play The Running Man because he found out his bosses were crooks.  In the novel, Ben Richards is a black man from the ghetto who voluntarily enters the game to win money for his family.  In the movie, Ben is dropped down into a closed off arena and hunted by several American Gladiator rejects.  In the book, Ben can go anywhere in the world he wants but everyone in the world is on the lookout for him.  And so on and so on.  The film was way off the mark on this one.<br /><br />Overall, I would have to say that this was not King's best work.  Some of his Bachman books are excellent, like The Long Walk or Roadwork, but this one is merely average.  Something I always look for in any book I'm reading or listening to is credibility.  Even a work of fiction needs to be somewhat believable.  In The Running Man however, I felt that the characters did not always act the way real people would in their situations, and some of the situations themselves were a little too far-fetched for my liking.<br />The one bright point of this audiobook was the narration.  This was my first time hearing Kevin Kenerly narrate, but I liked him a lot right from the start.  His voice is very rich and warm and easy on the ears.  His character voices aren't the best, but he did differentiate them enough so that you could always tell who was speaking.  In general he just sounded more like he was telling a story rather than reading one off the page.<br /><br />Included in this audio version of The Running Man is a piece Stephen King wrote titled \\"The Importance of Being Bachman.\\"  It is the introduction King wrote for The Bachman Books and it's an interesting take on his Bachman persona.  However, if, like myself, you've never read The Running Man before, I suggest you skip the introduction until after you've listened to the story because King idiotically reveals the ending.  Thanks for that Stephen.ou could always tell who was speaking.

1400086035|4.0|As if you didn't already know this story.  That's right, it's Dickens' classic tale of Christmas spirits and second chances.  Ebenezer Scrooge is a miser by anyone's standards, and the spirits have decided it's time for him to change his ways.<br /><br />Scrooge's long-dead partner, Marley, visits Ebenezer on Christmas eve to warn him of the danger of his miserly ways.  Furthermore, Marley portends that over the next three nights, three spirits will visit Scrooge to make sure he gets the point.  One by one, the spirits accost Scrooge in his bedchamber, showing him increasingly dismal scenes from his own life.  Christmas past, Christmas present, and Christmas yet-to-come, their message is undeniably clear: Scrooge must change his ways, or die unhappy and alone.<br /><br />Dickens' vignettes of Scrooge's life are beautiful and heart breaking.  The happy Christmas ball at old Fezzywig's, where Ebenezer was apprenticed, the poor Cratchett family enjoying their meager Christmas feast, and the future vision of Scrooge's own death, with his possessions being picked over by strangers and bill collectors.  We all know how this one ends.  Scrooge learns his lesson well, and changes his life for the better, and the lives of those around him benefit as well.<br /><br />The holidays just wouldn't be complete without at least one reading, or viewing, of A Christmas Carol.  What an awesome reminder of how our own lifestyles and choices can impact the people around us.<br /><br />Of course, this is not my first reading of A Christmas Carol, but I did notice something this time that slipped by me before.  At the beginning of the story, as Charles Dickens is introducing us to Scrooge, he notes that even the dogs of the blind lead their masters into doorways when Scrooge comes down the street.  This story was written in 1843 and I would never have guessed that there were seeing-eye dogs that long ago.  Fun fact.<br /><br />Fans of the Harry Potter audiobooks are already very familiar with Jim Dale, and you won't be disappointed with his performance on A Christmas Carol.  He brings his usual cast of characters and is perfectly entertaining.<br /><br />While listening to this audiobook, I amused myself by comparing Dale's voices with the familiar characters of the Harry Potter series.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that, while there were similarities, he still managed to give each character a unique flair.  It was fun trying to pick out which Potter characters they sounded like, though.<br /><br />For my final word, I'm going to borrow some of Dickens' own final words from his story, and I quote: \\"It was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well if any man alive possessed the knowledge.  May that be truly said of us, and all of us.  And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless us, every one.\\"  I couldn't have said it any better myself.

1611761506|4.0|For nearly 20 years, Barton Dawes has lived in the same quiet little suburban community.  He knows all of his neighbors and gets along well with them.  He is familiar with all the local businesses, like the movie house that he and his wife visit now and then, and the market where they get their groceries.  For an even longer period, he has been working at the nearby Blue Ribbon Laundry, where he began as a wash-boy and is now general manager.  It's nothing fancy or extravagant, but it's all Barton ever wanted from life.<br /><br />But recently, his entire existence has been turned upside-down.  The city has informed him that a new freeway extension will be going through his neighborhood, and everyone has to go.  Almost all of his neighbors have taken their settlement checks and bought houses in other parts of town, but Barton just can't bring himself to do it.  How can he just turn his back on the last half of his life?  How can he let them tear down the only memories he has of his son, now dead of a brain-tumor?<br /><br />As the inevitable demolition date of his home and business draws near, Barton clings desperately to the only life he has ever known.  The city is used to getting what it wants, all in the name of progress of course.  To them, Barton is just another number.  But as the roadwork draws closer, they will find out what a man is capable of when he has nothing left to lose.<br /><br />I have been a big fan of Stephen King for many years now, but have always avoided his Richard Bachman books for reasons I am not entirely clear on myself.  Just recently however, I finally read a couple of them and can see that I've been missing out on some good stuff.  Unlike the drug-induced fever-dream of his King books, the Bachman books are very clear and thoughtful.  It really is as if two different people were writing them.  Creepy.<br /><br />I really had to sympathize with Barton in Roadwork.  I grew up in a small town.  Sometime around my late elementary school years, they tore down the little Dairy Queen stand and built a shiny new convenience store with gas pumps and everything, and I hated it.  A few years after I graduated they built an overpass right through the middle of town, which I hated, and still do today.  A couple of years ago, they built a new school, and tore down the old building that I and my siblings, as well as my parents and their siblings, attended.  Do I need to tell you how I feel about that, or how I feel about what some people call progress?  Yes, I can sympathize with Barton Dawes just fine.<br /><br />And that's really what Roadwork is all about, isn't it?  It's not just about a man losing his home, and it's certainly not about a new road being built.  It's about progress, and how we lose a little more of ourselves every time somebody decides that it's time for something new.  In one flashback scene, Bachman tells us the story of how Barton and his wife got their first television set.  They had made a bet with each other, that they could each come up with half of the money by doing odd jobs on weekends and such.  They came up just short and spent several weeks driving around the countryside picking up returnable bottles to come up with the last $40 they needed to get the small black and white set.  Now Barton has a larger color model with a remote control, but he misses that old black and white.  That's progress for you, it knows dollars and cents, but doesn't know a thing about the sentimental value of things.<br /><br />There was a clever little device that Bachman used in Roadwork that I don't think I've ever noticed in any King book.  Through the early parts of the book, Barton has this little voice inside his head that he is always talking with internally.  He calls this voice Fred and they have some lively and rather funny discussions at times.  Fred is the voice of reason and of course represents Barton's conscience.  When Barton is thinking about what he can do to keep his home, or perhapsslow down the roadwork, Fred is always there to point out that Barton is getting a little crazy.  Barton never listens though, and perhaps halfway through the book, Fred is noticeably absent, even when Barton calls on him.  It was a little creepy to see how Barton's conscience had apparently given up on him and left him to fend for himself.  And a little later in the book we discover where the name Fred came from.  Creepy and a little disturbing.<br /><br />G Valmont Thomas has been involved in theater for many years, primarily as a director and coach.  I am a native Nebraskan so I was most interested to learn that Thomas served as the Assistant Professor of Acting and Directing at the Johnny Carson School of Theater and Film at the University of Nebraska.  Most recently, Thomas has been working in the theater departments of Southern Oregon University, and Ashland High School, in addition to narrating for Blackstone Audio, from which he has earned two Earphone Awards.  I found G Valmont Thomas to be a very good narrator.  His voice is deep and resonant, and he sounds very natural when reading.  Valmont also does pretty good character voices.<br /><br />Roadwork was written fairly early in Stephen King's career, somewhere between The Shining, and Firestarter, and is very different from his other works of that period.  I have to wonder if he was already feeling a bit stereotyped, or trapped by his reputation as a horror writer, and that is why the Richard Bachman persona emerged.  Whatever the case, I am glad he wrote this book, and am glad I finally got around to reading it.slow down the roadwork, Fred is always there to point out that Barton is getting a little crazy.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Lots of fun and no cheating necessary to figure it out.  Would like many more levels that increase in difficulty as you level up.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Neat little game  would recommend keeps you interested and passes time.  Definitely worth the 99 coins. Haven`t bought many but like this one.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch does a fantastic job as Sherlock with Martin Freeman doing a Fantastic job as John Watson. The perfect duo.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I'm glad I finally read this book-now I know why it was a top seller. The female character definitely draws you into the story line. It was interesting, yet alarming, at times to read all the activities in the book
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Listen, buy anything created by Wes Anderson. If you like cerebrotonic laughter and enjoyment or if you can spell &#34;fun&#34;. Give it a look.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the books before seeing the first movie and was so glad I did. This book captures the reader from the get-go. I'd find myself right in the action of the hunger games and definitely developed an attachment to all the characters.
B003KGBIS4|5.0|If you havnt seen this movie purchase two copies. One just in case you lose the other. Superb, unique, brilliant.
B004S5C8WG|4.0|Well constructed and conveniently structured characters but extremely unlikely turn of events in any reality. But still good escapism<br />Thanks
B00AEFXXFU|5.0|Classic with no commercials, always had to watch it on regular TV<br />Now I don'''t<br />such a fun movie and all time classic
B002KKCVVO|5.0|This will be the fourth pair of Teva's I have owned in 25 years.  The new design feels every bit as durable as my old ones and the soul is very comfortable.  Long live my new Teva's!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I decided read it again for the 10th time or more with the movie coming out.  It's still one of the best.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|The Timbuk2 Kindle ballistic Envelope provides excellent protection and care. Fits the Kindle paperwhite and have a good design and size.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Keep a note pad handy.  Helps you track numbers, shapes and colors. Loved it!  Can't wait for more. Great way to spend an  afternoon.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Wow...  Just wow...  This has to be one of the most intense books I have ever read.  The whole series was an excellent adventure so far, but this was a harrowing experience from beginning to end.  I think I developed an ulcer.  It was an awesome read.  The author has outdone herself and I already admired her intelligence and imagination.  I so hope there will be more books in this series.  I will be so disappointed if there isn't. The way the story ended leaves a treasure trove of possibilities.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Bag It is a really great game to play with the graphics are great it tests your skills and you have fun while doing it. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because it's harder for me to play and I get frustrated easily.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|As an actuary, I like numbers. This book has me wanting to watch more baseball. I used a similar tactic when I played in a role-playing baseball league. Seeing the strategy spelled out is exciting.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|Up there with some of BOC's best.  This is a must have for any IDM fans out there!  Great stuff.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I started this download over an hour and still haven't been able to play it. It took forever to download, a long time to install, and upon launching, it wants to download a huge resource file. The download won't work in the background and if my screen shuts off due to not touching it for a couple minutes the download wants to start over. Horrible model for releasing a game. Atter an hour I've given up and will be uninstalling. I cant sit and stare at a download screen for half an hour just to see if I even enjoy a game.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Hello my name is d..........and I am an attic.  What this isn't HOG anonymous!  Oh well, I guess I don't have to confess I fell off the wagon with this one.  I just  couldn't put it down. My granddaughter cut her hog attic teeth on this game.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|If you liked his previous books, you'll love this one.  This is his best book so far.  A real page turner.
145210655X|4.0|I like the art, but there's not much to read to my son. A few one liners from the movies and the rest is me explaining what the picture is about.... See baby Luke dropped his ice cream and Darth Vader gave him his ice cream. The pictures are cute, but I wish there was a little story to read. Maybe a day in the life of father & son. One of my favorite pages in the book is that Vader drew a picture of Darth Maul. Luke says, is that a good guy or a bad guy. Vader says, uhhhh a good guy. Luke says, because he looks like a bad guy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved it.  Loved solving the puzzles. Cant wait till they have more levels. Very addicting. Perfect for rainy days.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|There are a lot of Android car chargers out there, but most Android chargers are designed for 1-1.5A. Well the new Galaxy S4 comes with a 2A charger which is awesome, but not too many chargers support 2A for Android phones. Bought this, and tried the 2.1A Apple usb port first, and my Galaxy S4 charges from it with no issues. I was using the screen at normal brightness+Google Maps and the battery % still increased so it should be in the right mode. If it was in USB mode it would be limited to 500mA and the battery would still drain with the charger connected if the phone was in use. Since the Apple port works with my S4, it should be fine to connect another Android device to the 1.5A port. No complaints so far, plus Anker is one of the best non-oem companies for accessories and I got this on sale win/win.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|When I need to wind down, or I get bored with the other apps, this is where I go. I've played quite a few of these type games, this one is my favorite.No issues on my kindle fire :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging. Love this game. I can not put it down. Every level is so different. A welcome surprise.<br />Really cool
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great brain teasers.  easy to get sucked into.  can't wait for new levels.  recommend for all ages.  get this app.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This book is completely unpredictable. Just when you think you have got it there is another massive surprise. The best of the series so far
B008TRUDAS|5.0|That's how good it was! Once again i am pleasantly engulfed by the words of this author! It's a must read!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|i purchased these at the same time I purchased an Alison Krauss DVD.  Wow.  It was such a clean, clear pure sound.  Nothing artificial about it...just like you were sitting at her live concert listening to her.  And to top it off, I also listened to a DVD of her in the studio and did a double-take as the camera panned in...saw the word Sony...she was using these same Sony headphones!
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|Grandson wanted this, and he loves it.  It is a good show for kids and goes along with the Lego Batman WII game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Once I started playing this game I couldn't stop. It is a very addicting game.get it and you won't be disappointed. But be prepared to be driven crazy trying to get to the next level.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I did not understand this movie when it first came out so I never saw it. I only got it after I started reading memes on Facebook. I am glad I saw it, It will stay on my list of favorite movies for a long time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Such a great book!  If you are spiritual, you will be so comforted by what this author and physician experienced.  Also, he writes and explains in medical terms, which I loved and learned much.  Awesome book!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|this movie was enjoyable but not  the greatest movie i have seen.i enjoyed it but i probably want wath it again. i have seen better that i have enjoyed better.
B00D37UP4S|1.0|I got to say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen...Pick another movie!!!! If you do rent it, I guess I'll say &#34; I warned you&#34;
B008Y6RYDS|2.0|I loved this movie when it was first released so I thought I would love it again.  It is so dated I don't know that younger people would &#34;get it&#34;.  Watching it now a good deal of it seemed...well, silly for a lack of a better word.  I am torn between giving it a 2 or a 3 but I had to rate in on my impression now.
B007STXHTM|5.0|Amazing images compared to the original housing with the fish eye lens. There is no distortion and as with all go pro housings it stays completely dry on the inside. A must have for those who dive or snorkel!
B005K17RU0|2.0|this was an easy app to use until it was upgraded. if you have trouble reading very small print- don't get this app. no way to increase font size
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Very well written book and interesting to read.  I liked how the author flipped back and forth between her climb and her history growing up.  Never had a chance to be saturated with either part.  I would recommend this book.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It helps me forget the day, when it hasn't gone the way I would like it to. It even helps my grandson. Thank you.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great TV drama. Acting, writing, filming all wonderful. I would recommend this to anyone looking for smart tv. to watch
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I loved this game you could style girls and guys on your own.I like it a lot it is very easy.that's why i gave this game a five star rating
B0044C3RB4|3.0|This show started off very strong, but by season three had started to lose it's luster. Moving away from an X-Files like format, Fringe tries to find it's own niche, and fails at times.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|I couldn't ever get started, I found this game to be very confusing and would not recommend it to any one
B0047WJ12K|5.0|The movie is great and visually stimulating. I used it to teach satire to my high school seniors, which was awesome. Many of them already loved the film, and it was great to show them the film from another perspective.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I've never spent money on a free game until now and it was worth it.<br />The game itself is awesome! I love how you can invade your friends lands. You can send and receive free gifts that help you in battle. I only spent five dollar's. It was enough to help level up my warriors and start winning battles!
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|ABC Family has hit gold again with Pretty Little Liars, which alternatively makes fun of itself and keeps the high suspense.
B00383ZTXO|5.0|The album itself is awesome and this set is a great buy to get all the great takes and versions of the songs of this record.  Very happy with purchase and this release.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Season 8 of HIMYM is just as charming and sweet as the rest of the series. You finally feel like you are getting some good closure to many of the characters you have grown to love. While I am not sure where the series will go from here, I think it's safe to say this was the last good season of the show.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|This is the pinicle album for Iggy Pop in my opinion.  This album is amazing, every song is equally as amazing as the other, very few albums manage to do this but Funhouse does.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|LOST is one of my all time favorite TV shows. Most people were disappointed with the turn the series took after the writer's strike, but I felt it kept a strong connection to its roots and in true LOST fashion, always left you wondering.
B0009SOFGI|5.0|Great debut album full of hits that they still play today.  Bonus disc is excellent and worth the price alone, very well done and very nice package.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|LOST is one of my all time favorite TV shows. Most people were disappointed with the turn the series took after the writer's strike, but I felt it kept a strong connection to its roots and in true LOST fashion, always left you wondering.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really addictive. When I downloaded it I didn't think it would be very good as its free. Worth downloading.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I bought this DVD series for my dad for father's day. The cinematography is absolutely unreal. I learned a lot from this series, so I couldn't wait ti share it with my dad!
0307730700|5.0|Got as a Gift for my Husband and he doesn't read much finished this one in 2 weeks which is fast for him.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it!!!! Great game... It really makes you think and remember what you saw on the picture to put the puzzle together.
B005LAIII0|4.0|A great movie that is stunning and beautiful. So great action, heartbreak and well told story. Which one do you believe and want to be true?
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Pureity of Essence...<br /><br />What Kubrick could have done with today's FX would have fixed the only annoying thing about this movie, the manny shots of the B-52 from the gaming 3rd person point of view where the model plane is shown in impossible positions, relative to the moving background.<br /><br />Contrast these flight scenes with the motion in the majestic opening credits, during  the real refilling sequence.<br /><br />Whatever, it's nitpicking,<br /><br />Still seems the world was a safer place back then.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love . It so much you get to build your own town epic.you have to make sure that your town is happy.
B000085RPU|5.0|This was considered a 4 star movie when it came out in theaters b/c it was so unique.  Well it still holds true.  Very cleverly written, funny and filled with every cartoon character you can imagine.  My 6 year old nephew watched w/ me and loved it.  considers it one of his favorite movies.  The mixed animation with real life is excellent even by todays standards.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|One night Clary goes out with her friend Simon, and there she knows she sees a murder. But the problem is no one else can see it happening just her. After that one night her life seems to be forever changed.<br /><br />Now her mother is missing, and the only father figure she had has turned his back on her. Clary has no other family and no one else to go to for help. But Jace helps her and takes her to his home where there are others like him. There they have to figure out all of the secrets Clary didn't even know she had hidden in side her.<br /><br />This book is a very unique story line. I haven't read anything like this before. I felt all of the characters were awesome. There was action, tons of suspense even. And romance. However, there is one thing that might actually make me dislike the book some and that it what happens between Clary and Jace, what we find out about them. I'm hoping it is just a horrible misunderstanding. And if not, I'm not sure how I can keep reading with my dreams shattered! But until then I can not wait to read the next one to find out if I'm right or not!
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This was a great movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I play this on Facebook but it is awesome to have it on the kindle fire so I bet since I won't have to use internet to play it it would be better.
B0037AGASG|5.0|Supper ! I can tell what they are trying to do is simply good, supper good, there are nothing words I will like to take, I will come come back, when I need it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the author's style.  The end chapter was an unexpected phenomenal ending.  I can't wait for more work from her!
B007VT6QSI|5.0|Supper ! I can tell what they are trying to do is simply good, supper good, there are nothing words I will like to take, I will come come back, when I need it
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I admit it, I am a Trekie.  This movie is an excellent start to what I hope will be a 6 or 8 film franchise.  The action is great, and the actors are EXCELLENT!!!  Where did they get Bones?  He could be a clone of the original!!  The new Kirk is INCREDIBLE!!  (Please excuse the caps; it is my youthful exuberance shining through) Spock, Uhura, Chekov, Sulu, they are all wonderful.  This film is a MUST HAVE for any Trekie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun even though it is just a copy of temple run. Run, jump, skid and avoid the officer from catching you! Its really fun.
B001F4UHFI|4.0|I like Nick Cage as an actor, and I usually like his movies; this one is no exception.  Keeping in mind it is entertainment, not a documentary or a &#34;how to be a gun runner&#34; instructional video, it is well paced, and sufficiently well thought out to keep your interest, with very few slow points.  Not something to watch everyday, but well worth putting in the DVD library for sometime down the road.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I've spent lots of time with this game.  It makes me think and observe, and it's just plain fun!  One of my favorites.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|I just started getting into board games after getting introduced to Ticket to Ride and Settlers of Catan by a friend. I was looking for a game that was relatively quick while being easy to teach.<br /><br />The first time I played with my friends, I had already read the rules ahead of time so I was ready to teach everything. It took maybe 15 minutes to get everything across to my friends. The first game took maybe 45 minutes and each game after that takes about 30 minutes.<br /><br />I find that the gameplay doesn't really get too cutthroat. For the most part, players are just trying to complete their own objectives and there isn't a whole lot of sabotage going on. However, the Emperor card that grants a bonus 2 points for being the first player to finish the set number of objectives still keeps the game competitive. The game is fun enough that my friends and I will play 3 or 4 rounds together in a single sitting.<br /><br />What really strikes me is the artwork of the game. Everything is beautiful from the artwork on the land pieces to even the rule booklet. All of the wooden pieces are not just painted a specific color, but there is also small accents on all of them. The most impressive thing is how detailed the panda and farmer pieces are. They are really well done!<br /><br />As shallow as it might seem, having a game that just looks good gets people to want to try out it out. Having good gameplay makes people want to keep playing it. Takenoko has both of these characteristics, so I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It took me a long time to give in an  read this, and I'm glad I did can't wait to start the next one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was fun.  I had to hit up YouTube for a couple of them.  Looking forward to additional levels. Could be a bit more challenging though.
B00785P2QC|4.0|You can build the city of your dreams! It's a nice little game to play while you're waiting or just bored.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and addictive. Makes you really use your brain!! I highly recommend  this game for e everyone. It's really fun.
B0089LOG02|4.0|The story kept me yearning for more. I love historical fiction and this not only taught me more about our country's history, but also filled me with emotion and kept me hoping for positive outcomes for these heroines.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I never guessed all the twists and turns of the plot.  I found myself racing to read about what happens next.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|It starts on the outside.  then gets really, really, good on the inside.<br /><br />Over the decades and incarnations that he has gone through, David Bowie has had many, many great albums/CDs, many good ones and a few clunkers.  The Next Day is, I consider, one of his great ones.  Start with the blocked out \\"Heroes\\" cover.  Right away, there are high expectations as that is a classic album.  Now throw in his vocals and arrangements - viola!  Another winner.  What isn't to like?<br /><br />I don't know how he does it, but his voice is still strong.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The third book in the love story of Gidion and Eva is so amazing that I stayed up til 4am to finish it.  I am thrilled that there will be book 4 and 5.  In the third book, the trust and love that they have has grown where they don't mistrust each other.  I highly recommend anyone who loves erotic romance to read these books.
B008G12ERC|4.0|Not a bad cd.  I don't think this is up to their usual standards - or at least that is how it sounds to me,  The production, song choice and vocals are good.  There is something missing that I cannot put my finger on - but whatever \\"it\\" is, \\"it\\" isn't on this cd.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book that started it all. Are you curious as to what everyone's been talking about at the water cooler? I urge you to get a copy for yourself and try not to drool all over it. This book is hot, hot, hot! You ever think you'd like a dominant male in your bed? This book will ruin you for all your other romances.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Really isn't more to say than that, but have to do the obligatory 20 words.<br /><br />I have found that with many people, you either like or dislike Eric Clapton.  I am one of those that like him.  He has had some hit and miss albums (albums?  Do people use that term still?) over the years.  This is a hit.  He till finds a way to make a song interesting - whether fast paced or slowed down.  Granted, he is not the best singer in the world, but he certainly is a world class guitar player - and that more than overcomes his lack of vocal skills - although if you listen to radio today, he is head and shoulders above most of what is out there as far as singing goes.<br /><br />Anyway - if you are a fan of Clpaton's and haven't got this yet, what are you waiting for?  If you are not a fan - well, I suspect you would not be reading this to begin with.  If you are on the fence - this one may push you over to being a fan.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is the third and final book in the Fifty Shades series. I was not disappointed in the ending that Ms. James gave to Ana and Christian. This book is still just as hot as the first two but we finally get to leave our two lovers in a spot where everyone believes in the happy ever after.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Needs mire actions to it but kool.  Would download again if I had to.  First tine we played it I laughed my butt off
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Our naughty obsession continues with the second book in the series. You'll be unable to put this book down once you pick it up. Once you've entered the world of Christian Grey, you're in it for the long haul. Hold on to your knickers if you can.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game. I recommend this to kids of all ages. My only concern is that you barley have anything in your inventory. Other words this game is awesome
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A delightful romantic comedy written from the point  of view of a young man with Asperger's Syndrome. It is a light read but enjoyable in that there is plenty of tension in the form of the two questions - will the protagonist and his prospective girlfriend get together and will the protagonist find out the secret of his girl friend's father for her? Even though the end is not unexpected, the tension is still there.<br /><br />I believe this is a great book in terms of understanding what life is like for someone with Asperger's and as such is a very positive model. It paints this person in a humerous but positive light. We are on his side and admire some of the skills that a person with Asperger's has which the general populace doesn't have. Well done I say!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this APP,  I am always pulling it up if and when we end up with a storm in the area. It's really precise and in the moment and that's what you want when bad weather hits.
B0036UMM84|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I have seen it around 10 times and every time I see it, it is as interesting as it was the first time I saw it!!  What a wonderful couple of stars to put in this movie....they play the part perfectly.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable boos by nalini. I can not wait foe the next book in this series
1594481717|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised. I had no problems, and the book was in great condition! I would recommend this book!
B005LAIII0|4.0|I already knew this is a good movie, after I watched in blu-ray disc, I like the colorful in th movie, fantastic.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Can't even get this game to load and I waited for almost an hour. I was not very happy with this game
B0006J28L4|5.0|Everything about this film is great. First the overall quality of the original feature film, then the plethora of extras. All of that for a great price. Dont pass this up.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|My son loves this game and so do I it's nice to have so he can play with me sometimes
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really good game. Not as hard as I thought it would be. Worth your time. Can't wait for more levels
B006M4F67A|4.0|I like the variety of tile set ups. I would like it better if you could change the tiles like some of the other manning games
B00CWY76CC|4.0|So it's a decent room puzzle game.  easier than 100 floors...but it's a little short.  I would like more floors to play...
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Great read apart from all the sex it was a good story line.  I found it hard to put down
B0000AXE8I|3.0|First, if you intend to see the three Matrix films, might as well buy the  one with the three Matrix movies and an animated one. With newly raised shipping charges on used copies bringing up their  price and Amazon having a particularly low price (with Prime shipping) its a bargain. And... there is no sense buying Reloaded, if you haven't seen the first in the series, since this is a continuation without giving you any information to put you in the picture on what is happening. Not that one really needs to know very much, since  the  continuity filled with meaningless  gobbledygook doesn't make much sense in any of the pictures.  Don't get me wrong, you are not watching this film for its plot. At least, not if you want to enjoy it. What you should be looking forward to, and what you get in full measure, is a ballet, in some number of movements, which might be called, Dances of Death. This is only to say, that you get dazzling displays of movement as multiple figures, leap, dodge, parry, are hit and hit, in multifarious ways. The underlying plot, aside from some talk about The One and other non-sense making sentences, is that a society of machines (including robots) is out to destroy a society of humans and only the characters played by the leads and main supporting players can stop them.  It is fun to see the cast of good and bad guys cavort in rapid fire motion; it drags a bit when we get the talk, and this film, at any rate, goes on a bit too long.<br />Recommended for members of any age group  who get a kick out of acrobatic combat.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This film takes a part of history and presents plausible ideas as to what really happened that led up to Kennedy's assassination.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love this game. It changes by adding new challenges at each level and requires good hand-eye coordination. I like to play it on the Kindle because of the bigger screen.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This product is really comfortable to wear for extended periods of time most of the time if it weren't for how good it sounded, I wouldn't even realize that I have them on!<br /><br />Sound quality is amazing<br />Microphone is really good at cancelling noise that isn't meant to be heard<br />Fits many sizes of heads due to very good extentions<br /><br />It doesn't however live up to the range of how far you can walk but most of the time I'm never away from my pc for too long so I don't really care!<br /><br />Package was delivered perfectly on time!<br /><br />Would recommend this to anyone!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One of the best books I have read. To think that our lives can be totally changed by one event (and the reactions of people to that event) is a very humbling and frightening thought. I am not surprised at book endings very often, but I did not see this one coming.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I chose three stars of this because it so helpful. What I like about this book is that has everything you need . What I dislike about it is too long to read.  I will give this book to the person who need help on a word. Also if you like to read.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A good reminder to not take things for granted, to put important people first in our lives, to stick to our goals, and to not get caught up in the idiocy of today's world. The growth of Harold Fry, and his wife, is a joy to read.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|The &#34;monsters&#34; are all loveable. A sweet movie for kids, even toddlers will like the squishy &#34;monsters&#34; that are featured.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Very much like the full size arcade version, but a little harder to maneuver through the maze than with the joystick.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Perfect replacement for Google Reader. One button transition. Clean interface, easy navigation, great side bar navigation. Would highly recommend for organizing blog feeds and news.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Can be very addictive. The first few levels are very easy. The larger grids are challenging and take some real thinking to connect all the dots.
B005CX53RU|5.0|This fit my PX360-BT perfectly.  This purchase saved me from having to throw away my $250 headphones into the garbage.
B00BY8DIT2|1.0|I realized on their first album that Joe's guitar wasn't going to be the driving force of their songs.  But it was still a great album.  However Seesaw doesn't come close to Don't Explain.  First, it's like Joe's not there.  Did they put his name on it just to maybe sell a few more?  I like Beth's recently released \\"Bang Bang Boom Boom\\" album.  She sounded like she put her heart and soul into it.  Not so with this album.  Both Beth and Joe sound like they're just going through the motions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but 1 thing we need Multiplayer ! For kindle and kindle I wanted to hook up with my friends on a Kindle that I have and I didn't let me only I can join iPods which really sucks! GET MULTIPLAYER FOR KINDLE ON KINDLE!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I totally enjoyed this game!!! I can't wait for part 2! I'm so glad you added the hints or I would have never figured everything out lol. I highly recommend this game! Very well made. Beautiful graphics. If you enjoy figuring things out and unlocking things, you will love this game!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|difficult yet fun!  makes you frustrated at times but when you finally get out or just find another clue it's all worth it.  give it a try &amp; you'll be hooked!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very much like must.  It's been a while since I played a game like this.  It kept entertainments for hours.  No need to rush through it.
030758836X|4.0|This book wrapped itself around me for two days, and after I finished it, I felt a bit disoriented, like I'd woken from a lucid dream. I recommend it to anyone trying to write suspense; it should be on a suspense writing class's reading list. Also recommend to anyone who wants to get lost in a mysterious, often disturbing story.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Yes, indeed I found the plot more interesting than originally expected.  Oddly controlling,I felt Mr. GREY NEEDED A GOOD BEATING HIMSELF!
B00BCJ1AXE|1.0|After the first 2 songs that get a lot of air play, I was disappointed with the rest of the songs on the cd.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|In an age of crappy reality TV, this show is wonderful. The cast has great chemistry and the toys are great.<br />I wish that reality TV would just go away. Give me scripted action shows like this.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My 5-y-o son loves the game. He plays it all the time.<br />For me though it has a similar concept to most of the other games out there, like bakery story and surfs
B00B9HEAVS|5.0|This is a great cd. It's too bad most of the U.S. doesn't know about Inna.  I have been a fan since her debut.  I recommend all of her albums.  I think all three of them are amazing!<br /><br />Party Never Ends is amazing and I love her lyrics along with her amazing beats.  I'm not sure how anyone could stand still listening to her.  I have a wide variety of music that I listen to and she is one of my favorite singers.<br /><br />Party Never Ends Tour USA!!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Cant go wrong with the basics. Its a great album. Bruno Mars is extreamly talented. For the money this is great
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I have read only a little at this point, but it is a good book. Five more words required? What, am I in high school again? hmmmm...
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My grand-daughter is able to move and jump much more freely than in another one she has access to and uses at another home and will be happy in the rain-forest for long period of time (1 hr). I would recommend this to everyone.  I just think the fisher-price rainforest jumperoo should be available in local stores as well as on-line.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I mainly rented it because Josh Groban was in it. I did really like it. I found that I recognized many of the cast.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This one of the worse movies I ever watched, what a waste of money, Maybe I have no sense of humor but there was way to much foul language in it for me.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is loads of fun. My 11 year old loves it. Cool game for long road trip entertainment. Highly recommend
B0063M22QO|4.0|Love that tiles can be reshuffled to end game on positive note or that game can be replayed completely. Great for eye-hand coordination and scanning skills.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Fun game!! Interesting, delightful and a great time waster. The story line is cute and entertaining ,my daughter likes the art work.
B000002ULO|5.0|I am a diehard MCartney fan, but for some reason I didn't buy this CD 'till now.... I sort of was down on MCartney in the late 80's early 90's because he hadn't written very good songs for a while.... but the songs on this CD are his best after &#34;Tug Of War&#34;. I highly recommend this CD.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I liked the visuals, the audios, the story telling.... wow, this game was terrific! I agree with everyone else: it's TOO SHORT. If I hadn't taken a break, I'd definitely be finished in little over an hour! If you walk away from it for too long, you'll probably need a hint to see where you left off. Regardless I'd still buy the Room 2 sequel!! But please, give it more than 4 levels!!!<br /><br />------------<br />**EDIT**<br />------------<br />About the Aug/29/13 update to The Room app w/ additional 5th level \\"Epilogue\\": attractive, entertaining, but (again) too short. It took under an hour with no hints to be able to beat it. It might be the easiest level yet. Anyways, I wish the tilt function saw some action... but instead you get to play a mini piano by ear. Keep your sfx/sound on or you many miss some valuable pieces to the puzzle. Don't expect an explanation in the upgrade... you're still lost in time, and now you're going through another door! Room Two the sequel will be a separate game to purchase with a different room altogether- I'm looking forward to it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Twist on the classic 21st century tale of horrible husbands who dispatch pesky, perky, perfect wives and want us to believe in their good-guydom. Brilliant!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I just wish there was an easier way to add friends. This is a fun game and I play every day.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game! Great puzzle, awesome graphics! The whole family got into it when ever I played! I just wish it was longer!
B00006DEF9|5.0|This movie is like good wine....it gets better with time.  Everyone should experience a couple of hours with Gene, Debbie and Donald.....this movie is timeless.
B00846REIS|4.0|Is it me or is this book fifty shades of grey?  Don't get me wrong it was quite entertaining but too much like fifty shades of grey.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie.  I choose the movie after seeing it on cable and knew that I had to add it to my DVD collection.  Great story line, great dancing and Channing Tatum is pretty easy on the eyes.  I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!  Worth every penny.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This takes you directly to the most up to date videos but you can achieve the same thing just going to You Tube on the web
B004EPZ070|5.0|Great chick flic........saw it for the first time on cable and knew that I wanted my own copy.  Couldn't help but see shades of Sally Fields in the face of Gennifer Goodwin...and no-one can compare to Kate Hudson to play the &#34;bitch&#34;..........I did recommend it to my daughter to watch....great entertainment!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed it.  Would like to play more.  Makes you think in a different way. Maybe help to make a sound if you find something you need.
159463176X|3.0|This was an enjoyable read, but nothing to write home about.  Hosseini puts forth a number of vignettes that are indeed morally ambiguous, but he doesn't seem to realize the potential of the material.  I wanted, for example, more texture in the background re the war going on in Kabul.  One of the characters says that he feels sorry for the citizenry, especially &#34;the poor women,&#34; but that's about it.  On the other hand, Hosseini overexplains what his characters are feeling and why they are feeling that way, which became tedious.
0143039881|4.0|Well done & very comprehensive. Wish, however, she would have detailed even more the cooperation of many of the very wealthy Jews & their organizations (so called Jewish leaders) that helped the Nazis organize & carry off the deportations to the death camps. Don't tell me that they didn't know! Many were self serving
159463176X|4.0|I enjoyed the first story so much that I read it to my children.  It was a fable that paralleled bible stories.  Then the stories continued on to be more adult.  I enjoyed the many ways the characters stories unfolded and never got bored, but the last chapter did sort of fall short for me personally.  I think I'll try his first two books.
B00APYKXFS|5.0|I don't kno why people are putting bad reviews you can change the song you guys have no taste in techno but I love this game its energetic gets me hyper lml
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book.best trilogy ever.I would recommend this book to people who like action books.<br />I watched the movie got hooked and read the books.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Incredible, valuable lessons about empathy we all could use reminding of from time to time. Especially young people might benefit from reading this book.
B0058VW36U|3.0|Grandkids love to play this game. Keeps them busy and teaches them motor skills. Also lets them think and solve the issues of the game.
B0083Z614S|5.0|One of my favorite stories of all time! Such a lovely tale of two young children discovering nature, love, and laughter.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|My grandkids play this every morning. Helps with their motor skills. Keeps them happy. Gives them something to think about.
B008I43DYU|3.0|It was more calculator than I was anticipating. Having said that the keys are large enough you can enter functions without a stylus.
B000XUBC5E|4.0|I really didn't begin to truly enjoy this book until the last 100 pages. The first half of the book seemed to spend too much time explaining countless details about The Covenant House. I was also confused as to why Will kept on returning to the apartment after being attacked in his apartment. Not only that but then he allowed Katy to remain in his apartment after he was attacked there and after he knew his life was in danger. All of the above was a bit of a distraction and an annoyance. However, the end of the book, starting around page 340 and on was excellent.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL, IT ONLY DOES A FEW THINGS IF YOU WANT MORE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT
B00B29J0I6|4.0|Game play is constantly interrupted by Amazon game circle.  Otherwise enjoyable game for me and my four year old.  Just need to fix pop up for a five star rating
B002EXGAS2|5.0|Action packed with characters you believe.  It's the relationships that make this series stand out from the rest of the cheap action oriented movies.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Come on, it is a comic, what is not to love? The art was really beautiful and the action was lots of fun. I never expect Marvel movies, or any fun action/adventure based on comics, to be brain food. Instead, I watch strictly to laugh, enjoy the excitement and the art. I have to laugh at some of those silly one star reviews. What, you wanted Kant or Nietzsche? This is for fun!<br /><br />Anyway, I really got a kick of it. It was fun, had good action, the CGI was beautiful. Hey, I had a good time and that is all that counts, right?
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I'm a big fan of this series, but entwined left me wanting more. I wish there was more to the ending. It left you hanging. Hope the next comes out soon.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Had a two movie night last night - first Captain America, and then Avengers. I had a great time. Beautiful graphics, a true marvel feel, and Joss did his normal fantastic job with the whole shebang.<br /><br />Ruffalo is a great Hulk - very dry and understated in a very good way. Downey, Jr. does a bang up job as a self centered, self absorbed Iron Man. If you watched Eureka, you will remember Stark, the smug, smarmy ass that ran the think tank? Well, Downey is even named Stark - very appropriate.<br /><br />I smiled the whole time I watched both movies, and will watch both of them again.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game. Challenging enough to be difficult but easy enough to beat without wanting to cheat every ten seconds. I have played a few of these &quot;escape&quot; games and this would be my favorite so far.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game makes me think but doesn't stress. each level is a bit harder which is a nice challenge. very enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great app! It is challenging ,hard, and very fun. I would recommend it to anyone over the age of  9. It actually makes you think and it teases your brain. I love it!
B00APYKXFS|1.0|Besides that there's no tutorial, the gameplay is too fast and clearly unfinished.  You can't tell what you are supposed to do right away, and games are usually over within seconds.  Even after figuring it out there still appears to be no purpose to this game. Feels like the developer is just trying to make a quick buck here.  Do not pay for this game. I got this free as app of the day.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It's a little different than the previous version I have on Facebook and my phone.  It did not interface with that game, but I like it anyway.
B009RH973I|3.0|The hard pink part of the case is pretty good the softer side is just so so.  The strap that helps keep it closed has already broken, but it is an okay purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a great game! i love the minecraft pc addition, and this is a on-the-go version! but i really wish they would add redstone! its an overall great app! i suggest this to anyone!<br /><br />#ty's left foot
B00280LYIC|4.0|Although I am a nerd and seem to like all books once I picked up this Rick Riordan book he was my favorite writer. It is an amazing book and I highly recommend you to buy it. I read through the entire series in three months and moved on to the the next series. I preordered The House of Hades and can not wait to finally find out what happens. Best of wishes.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This game is on of the best by all military war games I have ever played!!<br />It is adventurous and powerful at the same time!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book ever!!! Worst ending ever!!! Great plot line!!! Terrible stupid horrible unfair terrible ending!!! How could Riordan be so cruel!!! Anyways, It is one of the most suspeseful books but completely unfair. I preordered the next bookThe House of Hades. I would highly recomend this book to anyone because it has a lot of different story types such as adventure and romance too, kinda.<br />Best of wishes
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Perfect for people who love horses love this game and its perfect for people to take responsibility for any and all animals
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you are a Jane Austen, Jane Eyre, or Bridgett Jones fan - you will not be disappointed with Downton Abbey. If you are not a fan of the aforementioned, I still think you would be a fan of Downton Abbey.<br />Downton Abbey is a great movie where the worlds of the upper class and those of its servants coincide. The plot is rich: suspenseful, dramatic, endearing (great characters), and educational (the language/dress of that era, events following the sinking of the Titanic and the lives of those living during WWI).<br />I try to articulate why I found this movie so addicting, and stumble through a barrage of clichés... Pick your feet u p, relax, and enjoy the show!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Interesting read. I would definitely recommend it.  I enjoyed not only the descriptions of the trail, but also of all her thoughts as she hiked.
B0002YLC24|4.0|I've seen Before Sunrise and After Midnight.  Before Sunset is the third one, all of which I liked very much.  The acting is very fine because it is very natural!
B0074VTHKM|3.0|An easy read, but a bit more far-fetched than usual Grisham.  Sorry, but I just could not be that gullible.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|Not really a good game, the music is too IN YOUR FACE. The graphics are too difficult to see, the game itself has been done a million times, and it's a paid app. Thanks for the effort but a no go for me.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I'm a long time fan of magic and this title exceeds my expectations. The addition of sealed play that allows you to create your own deck out of booster packs is a nice touch. This is the exact same game available on Xbox live. I only wish there was a way to transfer unlocks between platforms.
B003K16P3M|4.0|This book has been on my to read list for a while now. I finally decided to pick it up and now I am mad at myself for waiting so long to read this book. It has everything fans of the fantasy genre could ask for. The simple idea of being Graced with certain gifts was intriguing and I liked that everyone's gift was unique.<br /><br />Katsa is a wonderful heroine. She takes nothing from no one and is capable of taking care of herself. Heck, she could probably take care of a lot of other people as well. Her personality reminded me a bit of Katniss Everdeen and well I love Katniss so I took an immediate liking to Katsa. I always love strong heroines, and Katsa was stronger than most.<br /><br />Po was another wonderful character. I truly liked him from the moment he was introduced. He was strong but still humble. It never bothered him that Katsa could kill him if she really wanted to, and this is something that would bother most guys. He may not be in the category of my favorite heroes, but he is definitely easy to love and great to read about.<br /><br />One thing I simply found cool was that Gracelings had two different color eyes. I don't know why, but I really liked this. It really isn't that important to the story but now I kinda want to walk around with one colored contact. On a more serious note, I also enjoyed the writing. Kristin Cashore is a wonderful writer and her writing style will captivate you from beginning to end. Also, no love triangle, so that was a wonderful thing.<br /><br />While I really liked this book, I am not sure how I feel about the end. It was a good ending and I was happy, but I also felt it was a bit bittersweet and I am not entirely sure why. Maybe it's because I wanted to see certain events carried out or simply because I wasn't ready to let the characters go. Whatever the reasoning, I was kinda sad when I finished the book and was left feeling like there should be a little bit more.<br /><br />All in all this is the perfect book for fans of the fantasy genre or for people who are fans of The Hunger Games. This is the kind of book that keeps you up all night reading and when you finish you will be left wanting much more.
1574216988|5.0|I have enjoyed using several of the other Zentangle books and this one does not disappoint. The drawing are well laid out and, of course, intriguing. Instructions are clear.  I think it would be suitable for many levels from beginner to advanced.  I also liked the suggestions and instructions for additional uses for the Zentangle design.  This book is a lot of fun as well as mentally stimulating.  Oops!  Time to go create something.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Boom Bang Blam It's all just good fun killin' bad guys... lotsa lead flying and fists flying... all our old hereos of the silver screen joinin' up to make a few bucks from the movie going fans..... very few surprizes just chasin' bad guys can't wait till they make #3 cheesyer than this one......
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I ended up highlighting many parts to this book because it was so relevant to my life. You will definitely see your spouse in a different light.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this is truly a great app. I love it and I sugest it to everyone:) my favorite level is the highway...
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is one of the best performance video's I've ever watched by any band.<br /><br />If you even like Floyd just a little, get this!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like this app. It not only gives the weather in my city but any other location at the same time. Now I can track the weather in all my family and friends locations at the same time. I love it. It's great!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked this book, but the pace was a bit slow and I kept thinking something exciting was going to happen to ramp up the read.  A good way to pass some time while lying on the beach, but not a must-have.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Great advice with proof to back it up!  This book gives you enough data to make an educated decision about what you put in your mouth.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good APP,  challenging and fun. Recommend for anyone who wants a problem solving game. It's a nice if you're looking for something different.
0062280228|5.0|I confess to being shocked that this book is already out of print. I pre-ordered this book at Amazon, and got it a few weeks, perhaps a month a go. I read a lot and so put it in my stack. I just finished this book and am very impressed. I wish that Gaiman would write a few more full length novels. The quality of the writing in this book is quite good and my only complaint is the length, being quite slim.<br /><br />In content it is the story of a man who as a mature adult compulsively returns to an iconic location from his childhood after passing through traumatic and bookmark moments in his life.<br /><br />This location is much more than is seems as are the people who live there, a bit like Holdstock's Ryhope Wood. The book is told mostly from the view of a 7 year old, but for content is perhaps more appropriate for young adult. (In this it is like the \\"Monstrumologist\\" books which while supposedly written for children are books I found far more terrifying and emotionally troubling than most adult fiction).<br /><br />He meets three females. One, very old, the second middle-aged and the third pre-pubescent. (Diana?)The duck pond may in fact be the Akashic Records, the \\"grandmother may predate the \\"Big Bang\\", but all of this is held tightly together in a context of an everyday English countryside which should bring back memories to many Britons pushing 60. Highly reccommended<br /><br />All of that being said the book is excellent. To be out of print so quickly is nothing short of amazing. Will certainly take care of this one as a collectible.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|I bought this movie more for my teenaged daughter because she is fascinated with futuristic movies. I love the movie because of the storyline and acting that went with it. Its going to be watched many times!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I wasn't going to tune in at first. NBC put it on Thursday night after all the comedies that was a bit off putting. I think it would fit in better with Grimm, Chicago Fire or Law and Order: SVU. That being said the acting especially by Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy is great. The storylines are intriguing. It does have a bit of a slow tempo to it, but after a few episodes you really get into the story and want to see what's going to happen next. I'm not really intrigued by the murderer of the week scenario (Criminal Minds). I'm more interested in the dynamic between Will and Hannibal. Can't wait for season two.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I like this book very much. Shows the romance of two miss-matched people that are actually good for each other.
B004LRZ2YC|3.0|In comparison to the original &#34;Let the Right one in&#34; it was a little too graphic. I liked the original because it was understated
B002JIEYKS|2.0|Outside of Never Say Die there just isnt a lot to seize you.No great guitar riffs to speak of and Ozzy(God bless him) just aint got a whole lotta voice in this. Ive only listened to it once and perhaps with further listenings it will improve but for now, albums 1 through 6 are the best Sabbath/Ozzy work IMO.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|Really like 4 songs !! They´ll have to put some more rhythms on the next one. I do recommend it.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|There's about 265 people who gave this book five stars...but I just need to give my own review not just for other people but for the author as well to know ...  I am simply a fan of the Psy Series.  Nalini Singh is one of my fave authors and this book is just AMAZING!  For me, this is the best book so far from the series.  I read the book twice now 'coz I devoured it the first time and I read it nonstop.  I revisited some of parts in the story that was really so heartwarming and endearing that I fell in love with the characters all over again.  This is a story of a psy race that shows the power of love.  Love conquers all and when there's the guiding force of love that drives you, love will always find a way. I love the way Nalini shaped the character of Kaleb and he was in the previous books, thinking that he's a villain.  I was just surprised to find him to be the hero in this story.  I preorder the book ages ago, didn't even look who was featured in the story when I got it in my kindle that when I started reading about him, it just made me fascinated about his character.  His iron will and the forces that shaped him, you would think that he would turn evil.  I just couldn't believe that despite all of those things(don't want to give a spoiler), there was still a small part of him that remained good. It's one of the those moments in the book that just gives you such a good and tragic feeling when you actually see their history and how their love developed.  All because of a girl that saw something in him and believed in him.  Such faith and unconditional love.  There were complexities in this book that I loved.  The story is superbly written, featuring characters from previous books and I would love Nalini to write about Vasic and Aden...
B0084670FU|1.0|I liked the concept of how the different set of characters in different parts of the world may have been connected in some way to each other but I Couldn't make it through to the end.  It got too bizarre for me --came away wondering what on earth the importance was for the numerous sex acts going on within each set of characters.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|My nephew is 7 and he loves this show. Bought it for us to have a Castle marathon! Waiting for a rainy day !
B001EBWIRW|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I began watching this musical, but it didn't disappoint in the least. There is a time or two when the special effects date the film, but overall, this is a great unique little show. The acting is great, the story's a little warped, but I highly recommend to any who like slightly-creepy musicals (not that there are many), regardless of any flaws.
030746363X|3.0|I was after what T Ferriss had in the way of dieting after 4HB was recommended to me.  Obviously I bought it and then read all of the dieting chapters, buying all the herbs suggested.  I had been using my own diet plan and i followed Ferriss' for a month.  the rate of loss with the 4HB was a bit faster but not that much faster.  I got what I wanted from the book: my path gives me a rate of weight loss quite close to Ferriss' AND it's simply a matter of discipline to follow either - my biggest learning.  I don't think it's worth the asking price, buy it used.<br /><br />I am concerned about his very high protein diet and the consequences.  I'm also concerned that his diet is not a sustained weight life style but a crash diet - mine is sustainable.  mine is essentially a lower calorie type 1 diabetic approach which is easily maintained.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|It's ok but it does not have the note pad. But I am glad it helps you.<br />It's a great app otherwise.
0143123173|5.0|I loved the book, can't wait for more. Much better than the one hour show, and I love the show!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Need I say more..a great asset to the my video production needs. And for the price you can't beat it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 1 - Good!<br />Season 2 - Great!<br />Season 3 - Hold On too your seat!<br />My wife says I have serious problems. I agree, I just like it!
B005DJREGQ|2.0|I would only rate it two stars. Frankly the plot is not very interesting. The plot should be a bit more suspenseful
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's more than just opening an elevator door. Clever and complex. Lots of red herrings too. Hoping it doesn't get too repetitive or predictable.
B007BT0RKG|1.0|too big of file!  have to download individual maps and did not find the one I looked at was very detailed.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|YOU'D THINK THIS WOULD BE EASY BUT IT GETS PRETTY HARD ESPECIALLY WHEN YOUR TRYING TO GET 3 STARS ON EVERY LEVEL.
B000VZGK3K|4.0|As entertainment its fine.  I suppose its called The Aviator to let the viewer know the rest of it would be ignored except for the sex, drugs, and supposed mental illness.  By the way, it was Los Angeles Country Club, not Wilshire.
B0091MW50G|4.0|An entertaining disc of excerpts from almost all Verdi's operas-- some better than others.  A terrific buy at 9.99, though!  Check it out.
1439156816|5.0|This book is a 'must read' for any struggling writer trying to break into the published mainstream, as well as any seasoned author that may think he, or she, has it all together.<br /><br />King's heartfelt message about his pre-published days, as well as the many rich experiences he's decided to share with us about his after published life, will make any writer get up from their work station and offer a well deserved round of applause. Truly, he is a one-of-a-kind talent...
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Upgrading to Blu-ray was a must for me, this film looks fantastic, and it gave me an excuse to watch it again.  Beetlejuice is fun and funny; I especially love the world outside Barbara and Adam Maitland's house.  I wish more had been done with that and the sandworms.  This is definitely a film that screamed for a sequel yet none was made, more's the pity.  The cast is practically perfect (except for a couple of gimmick guest stars).  My favorite character remains Lydia Deetz played by Winona Ryder.  And I definitely appreciated Jeffrey Jones (as Charles Deetz) playing sympathetic character for a change.  His facial expressions are priceless when he's trying to curb the enthusiasm of his pretentious overbearing wife, Catherine O'Hara as Delia Deetz.  And Sylvia Sidney is of course a standout playing the afterlife caseworker Juno.<br /><br />This film is delightfully morbid and mischievous.  It's definitely worth multiple viewings.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|This show is so freaking cool! I don't know how I missed it all these years....but, i'm enjoying watching it now. The charactets.are so original.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome.  Well written. Envious at such a great ability for storytelling!  I couldn't put this book down to get anything done.
B000002J03|5.0|Whole Lotta Love indeed - filled with great moments!  Heavy metal classic album that set the standeard for all to follow.  All songs are amazing with the classics Whole Lotta Love, Heartbreaker, Ramble On, Bring It On Home!<br />Song by song ratings:<br />1. Whole Lotta Love - 5<br />2. What Is And What Should Never Be - 4.5<br />3. The Lemon Song - 4.5<br />4. Thank You - 5<br />5. Heartbreaker - 5<br />6. Living Loving Maid [She's Just A Woman] - 4<br />7. Ramble On - 5<br />8. Moby Dick - 3<br />9. Bring It On Home - 5
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I started watching but had to stop about a quarter into the movie. I found it too artsy for the sake of being original which it my mind made it simply feel &#34;fartsy&#34; instead.
0525953728|2.0|A good mission but a book that should have had a better writer involved. Hope the author didn't give away any training secrets by producing this.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|I find it witty and very well crafted. My one complain would be that the author focuses a large portion of his narrative referring back to Harvard University (a fact that I would also be extremely proud to mention - repeatedly - if it were me), however his message is far more universal than Harvard academics and it may, in some way, feel alienating to those who can't get passed the fact that they didn't attend the prestigious institution and miss out on the main message of the book. In the end, I found this book was a huge help in understanding the largely-understated principles of achieving happiness in our society, not only at work or school but life in general. I truly recommend it.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|frankly speaking, i did not use rss app before, but when i read that google reader will be closed, i have checked feedly - i love it. only one feature is missing: search. pls add this feature asap, then feedly will be the best. five star!
B001J20ZIA|4.0|I can easily take or leave the over-hyped celebrity voice-overs but the story is pretty solid and I enjoy watching this movie whenever I need a little pep for myself or to keep my nephews entertained when I'm babysitting.
B008GJV2OA|5.0|A classic. You should not miss this one. Kubrick at his finest. Satire defined, this movie is one for the ages.
B009CGR416|5.0|I loved the special, comic-bookesque effects and the story is solid. For those born before 1980 it may not be their cup of tea but the younger generations will certainly appreciate its (lovingly) idiotic humor.
B00B671VYU|5.0|Attention, attention, attention. Lordi's latest audio CD release titled (to beast or not to beast) is a must listen for any horror musical fans. Let the beast play with your mind. Scream out loud.
B00CL50KDY|5.0|An incredible (feels like) satire on both, the overly romanticized vampire and zombie genres which turned ridiculous too long a go and have lasted far longer still. This great rendition to second chances is funny, heart-warming and a great movie to watch with a date or great friends.
B009K0OL06|5.0|The characters became even clearer this year.  The battle for Emily ids far more complex between Daniel and Jack, with Nolan there to help and counsel.  Victoria showed how far she would go to protect her children.  Hoping Declan return some how Charlotte and he are couple delights to watch.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Love this movie! classic that gets better every time I watch it! The extra disc had so good info that was nice to watch.
B000UZNRS2|3.0|I give him credit for an entertaining book, but having just discovered the excellence of Barry Eisler, my bar is set very high.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an addictive little game. I finished all 10 levels in about one hour, so I'm excited see if they get more levels soon. This game worked great on my Kindle Fire, it is fun and challanging. A great free app that I will recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire and this just as much fun but without the hassle of shuffling a deck of cards
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is mildly challenging and not too hard for me to play with my 7 year old son. It also has really good graphics. Kind of like a game of Clue... loads of fun for one or two :-)
0525478817|5.0|This book is exceptionally well written.  John Green put a lot of thought into the way his characters interacted in this masterpiece.  Even after reading this four times, I still catch myself thinking about Hazel Grace and end up reading it again in the usual overnight manner.  I am seventeen and I recommended this book to my 50+ year old boss.  She absolutely adored it as well.  This book is a great self find book. I learned just how fortunate I am with the turn of every page.  I recommend this to people of every gender and age.
B00005A46T|5.0|If you're into Slipknot, this CD is a must own! This CD has been my go to for working out and cruizing around - perfect for both!
014241493X|4.0|John Green did it right again!  I started with The Fault In Our Stars and was thoroughly impressed with the quality of this book.
0316067601|3.0|Book did not arrive in the condition expected....This book had appeared to have been passed around to several people if not with the exception of the possibility of the book being an ex-library book.....
030789701X|5.0|I got this guide book the same day as the game and was happy to see it was not damaged in the process
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|The book was energetic from the moment it began.  No lag in excitement.  The characters were believable.  I truly enjoyed this book and am ready to start the next.
B009ZE27US|1.0|I am 9 but it said that I am 45 ls that a lot of years ln between 9 and 45
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved it! It has good humor and great details  that make you want more! I recommend this book to kids ages 10+
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is one of the first apps I downloadedp-u on my kindle fire. it is a great game for relaxing.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I purchased this app a few years ago. I only used it on one device at the time. Since then I have used it on multiple devices and the sync option was tricky at first. Once I updated all apps sync was easy. Everything worked out great. The most important app I have.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Hard to read but harder to live.  I will definitely be more aware of life around me. Definitely glad I read this.
1907360468|5.0|I was surprise when I receive the book, Its huge and yes its a complete work of William Shakespeare and I like it
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I constantly play this game. It's better than the rest.. even the new magic game that just released. Takes time to save  up cards... run two decks.. You will get better cards faster... I'm lvl 9. Just beat a lvl13.. because of my deck that I have spent 0 money on...  please add me,  cuono8104
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a great game to play when your alone at home and have nothing better to do than to sit at home (alone) and play a game with yourselves. Have fun (y)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME.As I said I am seriously addicted.To Give you a idea of the game, it's sort of like temple run. Although on my opinion, this game is MUCH MORE FUN. I hope love this game!
B007REV4YI|5.0|What can I say? The Daniel Craig Bond movies have lifted the series out of the doldrums and brought it into the 21st century.<br /><br />And &#34;What makes you think it's my first time?&#34; ranks right up there with &#34;No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!&#34; as greatest Bond movie line of them all. (Watch it, you'll see.)  :)
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Love it. Very different, intriguing music, new gameplay compared to previous quell games, which are both excellent.  Give it a try!
0062278592|5.0|It has been years since Gaiman published an adult novel, and clearly he has not missed a beat.  In his latest work, Gaiman yet again weaves a dark and satisfying fairy tale. Gaiman is strangely self-reflective in this novel: the lead character is never named, but bears a striking resemblance to Neil.  The novel details the other-worldly fear that all children have when faced with the challenges of growing up.  Having to trade the delicious horror, heroism and magic of childhood, we sometimes retreat inside our own selves.  Gaiman show us what this picture looks like, and we can stand and stare for hours. Engrossing, poignant and satisfying, Gaiman continues to transport his readers to places we have never been, yet already know all too well.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|The characters are interesting but the story is hokey and poorly written. The animation has very little style to it. The pacing is slow and drags in many parts.
B000PMFTDQ|5.0|No one sings Strauss like Jessye Norman, not even the German sopranos!  She brings out the beauty and the depth of the poetry she sings.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A wonderful way to vicariously experience being an ultra-marathoiner. Author pulls it off with lot's of self deprecating humor, terrific profiles of most of the legendary ultra runners, and with great details of many ultra races.  The book, if you are a runner, will also save you thousands of dollars when buying running shoes but I am not tipping how.  ;-)
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I chose the book because I wanted a description of a Near Death Experience not interpreted from a religious perspective.  Anita Moorjani was raised a Hindu in a traditional Hindu family in the British colony of Hong Kong.  She attended a Catholic school and had a Chinese nanny.  The book is very readable and does a great job of relating her fascinating experience.  Her relating of several of her experiences touched me personally and deeply.  For someone interested in NDE this book is well worth reading, interesting, and enjoyable.
B00AVIM040|5.0|I've seen it many times, but not in HD.  So, that was a definite improvement over the old SD version.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|Bought it for my first build. Superbiiz.com had it a little cheaper but I had some Amazon credit so purchased it from here. I mainly surf the web, play a little Diablo III/SC2, some word processing from time to time. It does what I need it to do stays at 36 degrees unlike some AMD CPU's I have had in the past that would get as hot as the sun. Great for entry level computer builds.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|Upside Down had little or no advance publicity and perhaps it should have done.  It ranks up there with Inception and Cloud Atlas as, not a futuristic fable, but a stunning array of visual effects and a well-portrayed Romeo and Juliet / West Side Story-line.  Good acting and stunning visuals. Definitely worth watching.  Too bad it did not get more publicity.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini nails it again.  He explores love in many of its manifestations.  You will laugh and you will cry . . hard.  This book is a masterpiece, it is one of those books that is everything a book can be:  the reader experiences the widest range of emotions, goes from jubilant to laughing to crying, the power of the printed word is never more obvious.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|When people start comparing their &#34;favorite&#34; movies, or the &#34;best&#34; movies, my husband shares this one. It's an amazing story, and despite the tough subject matter, I can watch it multiple times.  Just talking about the movie is an emotional experience for me, but I'm glad I watched it and can't recommend enough this touching, poignant and amazing story.<br /><br />If you want to know what love is, watch this movie — and try to be the kind of person who could think like this, and be this loving.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I really like this game.  Been playing it on facebook for quite a while and was glad to be able to get it on my Kindle.  I wish there were more of the saga games available.
0525244581|5.0|I so loved this book and recommend it to everyone, whether they seek to learn about Taoism or not. Everyone (or nearly everyone) knows about Pooh and the rest of the characters in the Hundred Acre Wood. How else should someone explain the complexities of a philosophy except through the world of Pooh and Piglet?<br /><br />I wish more philosphy books and religion books took this tactic: simple, familiar tales told in a way that trusts the reader to understand in the way s/he knows best. Amazing book. Read it.
B004TP0M0K|4.0|I didn't find the Camel Club books as compelling a read as some other of David Baldicci's  books.  A satisfying read.
0061186473|5.0|I read this story collection back in the day, when it was first published. (My library was kind enough to share its copy with me.) Years later, the stories still resonated with me, and I had to purchase my own copy to share with friends. I took it home one night to read, then promptly handed it over to a friend who doesn't usually read — and in her lunch hour, she read three stories. Her boys are reading it now.<br /><br />I am glad I own it, and I can't wait to get my copy back. If not, I'll just have to buy another one. It's that good.
B002J2PB10|5.0|I thought this movie was so funny. I have seen it on several occasions and have recommended it to family and friends. Great movie Quentin.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Great
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Queensryche are back from the ashes, I bought both The Geoff Tate version of Queensryche Frequency Unknown and the Self-Titled Queensryche with Micheal Winton, Scott Rockenfield and Eddy Jackson to show my support for both bands, since I have been a fan since the early 80's. First off do yourself a favor and aviod the allstar version of Queensryche you will be greatly disappointed I was. The Self-titled cd with the surviving members and their new lead singer Todd La Torre puts the allstar version to shame (sorry Geoff). There is not a bad song on the self-titled cd and the live bonus tracks are really well done. I also agree that if I did not know better Todd La Torre sounds just like Geoff Tate. So if you want the real Queensryche buy the self-titled cd over the allstar version piece of crap.<br /><br />  Charles Smith
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My 7 year old and I are both addicted to this game lol. We love it so much it's downloaded on both iPhones, the iPad and the Kindle Fire.
B00BWDJILG|3.0|wanted more from this cd was not the sound I was looking for needs more groove more up beat to sale
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting games with a challenge for me to. Free make it even more fun for everyone to get into the game. Suggest those who enjoy puzzles download and give it a try.<br /><br />Marvin.jay4@gmail

B00992CF6W|4.0|love it but were is the redstone. i used redstone on the computer. I also want to place the things in crafting bench insted of finding the materal.
B00C1CO0XS|3.0|It is a good cd but needs something to make a better groove so today young can enjoy the music of Nat King Cole
B0084ANCBC|4.0|In order to read Vanity Fair, I put my mind into the times of the day. Women, such as Becky Sharp, exist today. Thackerqy's themes held true. The read is somewhat challenging, because of vocabulary no longer in use and references to the culture of the time that are  usually outside the knowledge of the modern day reader.<br />The film does a disservice, since it made Becky a heroine. Becky is more aligned with being a sociopath and is better compared to the character, Cathy, in East of Eden.  The book is important for exposing the society of its day.
193700788X|5.0|I've read the entire Sookie Stackhouse series and this is the perfect finish, though I'm sad to see the series end.  It's interesting the mixes reviews about the ending and the all important &#34;who Sookie ended up with&#34; but I feel the author stayed true to her vision and followed the threads of story to the very end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a good game to keep your interest going. I like it because my husband didn't get it right away.
0517543052|5.0|I like Ram Das, I like the way he teaches and his approach.  I like how he shares teachings from his guru.  This is a funky book and oddly put together.  That's part of its charm.  Be open minded.  Read this in the tub.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great graphics, really brings the battle to life, and feels like more than a card game. Game play was smooth and challenging without being impossible.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|This was a tough one. A lot to like- a richly realized world, lots of action, lots of interesting characters... but there was just too much going on, too many factions, and too many characters for me to follow everything. I had and still have a tough time figuring out who wanted what. And I'm not sure I've read a fantasy novel with such an overwhelmingly pervasive magical system- pretty much every character was a sorcerer of some sort, or at the very least was chosen by the gods and gifted with some magical talisman. That's not a knock- just an observation. It seemed pretty clear the magical system was well thought out.<br /><br />But it kept me interested- I typically read in short sessions, 10 to 30 minutes at a time, throughout a given day, and I never found myself choosing another book on my Kindle. And I've heard such great things about the rest of the series that I'll certainly continue it. All in all, a somewhat uneven but overall positive start to a new (to me) series<br /><br />-A. C. F. Crawford, author of \\"Sailor of the Skysea\\"
0375869026|5.0|This is a great book! I purchased it because it was my daughter's 6th grade summer reading selection. She was enjoying it so much that I couldn't wait for her to finish it, so I could read it. I absolutely loved it!  It will make laugh and cry, but most of all it will make you think. You will realize how much a small gesture of kindness can enrich your life and the lives of so many others.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this kindle case.  It protects the kindle well.  I like the unique design with the city names on it.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is arguably one of the best albums I have ever heard.  Sixto Rodriguez is a Bob Dylan with a better voice, but equally poetic and deep lyric.  Unfortunately, as depicted in &#34;Searching for Mr. Sunshine&#34; he never received the recognition he deserved.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This series is fabulous. Drew's POV makes the book exceptional. You won't be disappointed when you read it. Very good read.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It wraps everything up in a little bow. Almost every character you've seen makes an appearance. It's very contrived. But it's good to know the ending. Maybe you should just google it, or check it out from the library.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Loved the 3rd book - now I have to wait for the 4th one. How long before we get a sneak peak?
B000XTLUW0|3.0|Never have seen the video. Music is ok. Too much gasping for air by the lead singer. I like the others better.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Everybody needs to watch this movie if you take a lot of vacations or not it is a must watch!
B008G12ERC|4.0|Imaginative, creative and great lyrics on some of the songs. I&#34;m just not fond of about half of the music.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|Kind of lame.  It has a few moments, but the story was weak and the ending didn't seem to make much sense.
B002GZQYMK|4.0|Mostly I'm not fond of it. Love the guys voice! Music goes on a bit too long for my taste.
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|Not worth the 2 hours, or whatever it was.  Actors taking paychecks on this one, not a good story at all.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Great music. Great lyrics. Great sounds. Creative and knowlegeable. Fun, uplifting and introspective. I recommend it and seeing them in concert. They ROCKED at Red Rocks!
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|It was a guilty pleasure and I was worried it would be too teenie-bopper and like that crappy Kristen Steward series.  It wasn't.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book has motivated me to start purging immediately!  This author makes it simple and desirable! We definitely live in the land of &#34;too much&#34; and become slaves to it.  Jay shows us how to get back to what really matters!

0345536886|4.0|Late to the party with my take on [[ASIN:0345536886 The Litigators]], I defer to the other excellent interpretations: A comical cast of characters---and the author, near the end, returning to the true legal thriller genre that earned him fame. I, too, had quit reading Grisham's maudlin novels and read this only because it was a freebie.<br /><br />You'd think a John Grisham protagonist who escapes a 600-member mega-law firm working 100 hours per week earning $300k a year, only to take a job as a street lawyer with the [[ASIN:B0040574HS Keystone Kops]]-ish firm of Finley & Figg, would immediately turn the firm around. But not here---at least, initially. Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are partners at their ambulance-chasing boutique law firm where they bicker like Oscar and Felix, the Odd Couple.<br /><br />Wally Figg has [[ASIN:B00003CXFV Erin Brockovich]]-like aspirations of a mass tort lawsuit against Varrick, manufacturer of the cholesterol-lowering drug, Krayoxx. Only ambulance-chasing Figg singles out morbidly obese plaintiffs with no medical research to substantiate their claims---and no experience in federal court. He dreams of a billion-dollar settlement without any work.<br /><br />Having filed the suit, the firm can't withdraw from the case, and Varrick hires high-powered litigators at Zinc's former firm, where he was a paper pusher in the bond issuance division and never saw a trial. Three lambs to the slaughter. \\"The three stooges bumbling into the courtroom...and no clue about what to do next.\\" Fortunately for Finley, the judge has good cause to let him off the case. Figg escapes into a bottle of booze after a year of sobriety, leaving only Zinc, who does mumble a few appropriate words.<br /><br />Being a person who questions if lawyers have any warm-blooded relatives, I had no pity for Zinc, except he has a caring wife and newborn daughter. That and he takes on the case of a young boy permanently brain damaged by lead-based paint on toys made in China. It's doubtful Zinc will ever earn a fee from these poor immigrants, but he shells out thousands of dollars properly researching the case. Though he earns less than secretary-scale wages at Finley & Figg, Zinc meets weekly with the family and takes a personal interest in the poor child.<br /><br />By doing what is right, Zinc shows his mettle. \\"Justice, with its flaws and ambiguities, had prevailed in a magnificent way.\\"s doubtful Zinc will ever earn a fee from these poor immigrants, but he shells out thousands of dollars properly researching the case.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is a series of interviews after the zombie apocalypse.  The book is very well written and I couldn't put it down.  Each story is about a different character in a different country and goes from the beginning of the infection until the final outcome.  There are details on how different governments reacted or didn't react and how individuals reacted by themselves and as groups.  There are stories from the military and civilians.  I really enjoyed this book.  I like stories that lead me somewhere I haven't been before and make me think how I would react in a similar situation.  And yes, I know there is no such thing as zombies!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|can you escape is a great game! very challenging! this game allows you to use you brain in a challenging way!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You can build anything you can imagine.  Imagination is a must. It is a game that is interactive and can be enjoyed by as many or as few as you want.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Difficult but not so hard that you have to cheat. Looking forward to more levels. Really Hope it is soon.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I thought the series was great and the ending was good. I hope they make the rest of the movies..
B004SBS8LA|5.0|No interruptions from adverts, which is a great bonus, new characters for the birds to go after that have a south American feel.,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|needs more rooms.  I wish I had known it was only ten rooms.  I would have waited before I downloaded.
B00BLCHL4Y|5.0|I loved Vikings. It kept a great pace and every episode was interesting. I actually thought there was good character development. Vikings also shows a culture where women had power even though it was way in the past. Didn't expect something this great from History Channel. My favorite show on TV this year. I hope this has many more seasons.
0307454541|5.0|The girl with the dragon Tatoo is the first chapter of the Millenium trilogy written by the Swedish writer, prematurely died,  Stieg Larsson that has captured the attention of millions of readers around the world, becoming a real case. Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist for success that drives the magazine Millennium, is the protagonist of the story and, with the help of Lisbeth Salander, a young and very capable hackers, has to inquire about the mysteries that surround the history of the Vanger family. An astonish novel, a well -articulated story, all the pages have need to be turned quickly. A narrative style truly remarkable for what I consider one of the best books in recent years. Suitable for everyone. The hardest thing is to miss the other two chapters of the Millenium Trilogy...<br /><br />Wish to comment this review? Please come visit my blog!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I couldn't put this book down wish there was a second book, read in a day awesome love story :)
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Enjoy the game very few bugs fun and well put together! Have played nonstop since I've downloaded it only and have had a few small glitches I moved past quickly.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's a good game to pass time, but puzzle pieces are slow to come. Works great on kindle fire. Kid friendly with lock on in-app purchase buttons.
0596007124|5.0|I like humor anyhow, and if we can interleave knowledge and humor<br />together to help piqué my interest, then let the good times roll.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This has been great especially with the weather we have been having. QUICK & easy to use. PULLS right and is ready to go
B000SEIBB8|4.0|What can I say? It's the famous Gang of Four behind this text. They are thorough in their<br />delivery of the necessary tools the modern day computer scientist needs to get his/her job<br />done, with professional and contemporary methods. I fully support anyone delving into<br />design patterns to have this in their arsenal.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I bought this for my fiancee. He absolutely loved it!  He was so happy.  It was like Christmas again. I bought it as a surprise for him for Father's Day.
B00005JMEW|5.0|A movie that gives you action, dialogue all the way from the beginning to end. The movie is called Kill Bill!!!
B00004XQ83|4.0|I loved the gospel singing and the old country melodies.  If you are into this type of music you will love this CD.
1476734941|3.0|I've read the book, but haven't tried the diet yet. The book is Ok, not great. It seems short on facts, stats, and other details. In short, written for the masses to make money, not to help people. The concept is a good one though - one that I plan to try.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This  is a very funny movie, that will bring back memories of the good old days for the senior citizens.  It will make the younger generation laugh their asses off.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|After I saw this documentary, I rushed and bought. This film is such an eye opener, everyone must see it at least once. Especially if you have children and you care about what you are buying and feeding. Learn how and what it means products race to the supermarkets shelves, what it means a genetically modified bean and all for the sake of profits. This is a must see.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I prefer seeing this type of movie where the story adds on to the fairy tail as opposed to just retelling the story.  Good acting, Good story.
B000R3NNDQ|3.0|This is a book that sets forth the management scenario to help understand the ways to motivate and move others. Like &#34;Who Moved My Cheese?&#34; it gives the reader insights into ways to initiate changes. Great for beginning managers and those who are studying business. Just OK for someone who is not in a management or business environment.
B003EY7JH6|5.0|A thoughtful look at a colorful but thoroughly-thought-out world, Prelude to Foundation is a gripping, well made, and very scientific book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it. I laughed I giggled I tooted. Very different from the movie but I loved it for what it was
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game.<br /><br />Some levels are quite challenging. Me and mt nephew really enjoy playing this one together. Hes 11 and its sorta easy for him but also challenging.
B0060CV31C|5.0|Adorable good family movie. Funny, my sister loves this movie along with LILO and stitch. Over all great movie. Love it
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|So very funny, parts of this book had me laughing out loud. Truly a great buy! I am very happy with my decision to read this book.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Gave to my daughter as gift. I have not seen it yet but it is one of her faves! Will get to watch it when she will part with it!!!
B003U80I5G|1.0|Before I actually review this film adaptation of Jane Eyre, first let me say that the novel is my favorite novel, and I own many film adaptations. I love each adaptation for different reasons, and some I enjoy more than others. This one, however, is not even worth half an hour of your time. For those who want their films to mirror the book it's based off of, this film does not come even close. If you're like me and that is not necessarily a deal breaker, there are many other problems with it. I did not find the romance between the two main characters believable. One minute they seem distant from one another and the next he declares his love for her. The cinematography is absolutely horrible. The 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack was released only three years later, and it's incredible just how much sharper and clearer it is compared to this one, even though it is supposedly remastered. Please chose a different adaptation. I was not at all impressed with it, but feel free to come to your own opinion. I would rent it before you decide to buy, should you chose to do so.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|plenty of credit and time sinks to suck the player into buying in game currency...if you don't, at some point, want all of your facebook friends knowing you are playing this game, there are missions you can't clear from the mission queue...at first it was mildly amusing but anyone who has played this type of game before will understand what I mean when I say it ends in a perpetual grind
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Very slick interface and true to the card game. For a free app you get a lot. It's a huge download but worth it if you have the space.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I really enjoy having so much information at hand. I still don't really understand all that I can do with the app but I enjoy what Ican do.
B008KYDUYG|5.0|Great album set! All CDs were in perfect condition. Uploaded to my iTunes without any problems. I highly recommend this item to a Green Day fan!
B009YVBZO6|1.0|Not samsung.  I dont understand why this is available for download. Waste of time. Do not download save some time
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This author gets you involved in the lives of the characters.<br />I could not put the book down and read it within two days.<br />Highly recommend this book, and any other written by Khaled Hosseini!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Handy little pice of software installed on my HD Kindle and I like it. It is easy to use and has some very useful features.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|A lot of the stories are familiar, but it's a great story of the power of man's vision. Very inspiring.
B004ELSDZK|2.0|Not very challenging, I won't be playing very often. It was free and installed correctly... Game play was fairly boring.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|Saw this on cable years ago, thought it was funny. I'm not big on westerns or comedy for that matter, but when it,s well done, I guess you have to like it.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Love these types of modern movies that showcase an era gone by, where we as a country were just forming our goods to the masses, and people wanted more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game.I always liked games like this one Great time killer recommend to all
B00026ZG10|5.0|I can not tell you how often we have watched this movie it has serious moments and funny moments. Fast paste also.
B00BPXKWKY|5.0|25 years on, \\"Green\\" remains one of if not the most diverse R.E.M. records.  As their major label debut, it exposes their pop sensibilities (\\"Pop Song '89\\", \\"Get Up\\", and \\"Stand\\"), extends their melodic sensibilities (\\"You Are The Everything\\", \\"World Leader Pretend\\", \\"The Wrong Child\\", \\"Hairshirt\\", and \\"Untitled\\"), while re-enforcing their early approach (\\"Orange Crush\\", Turn You Inside Out\\", and \\"I Remember California\\".
0767803434|5.0|Great Movie love to watch it over and over.  Can't go wrong with Harrison Ford in the lead role .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Was a great mind exercise,  Not your average app that is either so easy that not fun.  Some apps are so hard that you give up.  This one had me thinking but also was not impossible.
B0045HCJFS|4.0|Terrific movie for those that like Kurt Russel. Good in the suspense area and keeps you wondering what is coming next.

B004ODLUGM|5.0|I've even watched this without my kids! I love the rhyming and timing of the film. The characters are fantastic! I would recommend this to anyone with kids!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great game overall. Wish you could earn aura more easily. That or else have not so many level ups that cost aura. Other than that love it.
B009AMAGQM|4.0|Although the movie deviated from the book still a good movie to watch, although could be confusing to those who have not read the book first.
B001LMAK88|5.0|It is one of my all time favorites. The plot is well done, good action and cinematography and the cast of Danny Glover, Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, and Kevin Costner work well together. It is one of those films you can watch over and over again and not get tired of it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|spend way too much time looking and learning from pintrest. from gardening and photography to calculus tutoring. thanks<br />the convience it bring is amazing time saving tricks recipes to making cakes.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the game is pretty good. if it didn't freeze I would love the game. plz fix the glitches. thank you
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|This was a good movie. Not something to buy and re-watch but entertaining. The minions were funny (and somewhat aggressive).
B00BRUYQFC|2.0|I like a couple of the songs but I just don't understand the reason for the length of the tracks. Is it really necessary to repeat the line over and over and over and over again? So glad I used reward dollars to pay for this cd or I would have been even more disappointed.
B007M45PMU|5.0|LOVE THIS! Music and lyrics are great. I keep listening to it over and over again. Highly recommed a purchase.
B00993EY2O|4.0|Awesome film about New Wave artists such as Joy Division, New Order etc. Tells the story of the Manchester club that started many careers.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I am usually disappointed in sequels but I absolutely love this movie. I was not disappointed at all and will watch this one as many times as I have the first one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is a thinking game there are skeletons zombies creppers even spiders it is so fun.EVERY ONE SHOULD GET MINECRAFT
B00BYISQTO|5.0|As always, The National did not disappoint. There isn't a track on Trouble Will Find Me that isn't worth buying the entire album. I can already tell that it will be my most played album of the year.
B0063M22QO|2.0|I really like this game and the calm music when you win.  I am new at playing on kindle fire..I have to undo my good report on this game it is now not responding after #85 or 86

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It has a wonderful story with great games and delightful music. the ocean sounds are a great touch and I love the surprises from the sea. Beautiful squirrel was an outstanding bonus :) you will find yourself addicted to this game. Please please bring more like this to the table. I will play all day long!!
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|It might be a ripoff of toka boka but I never played that app but how come with dress up games no one says &quot;this is a ripoff of every dress up game.&quot;?  Yeah it might be hard to comb the hair but I love it and so do my sisters.  I think all the bad reviews are just trying to get them to make everything free or less like toca boka  or just are lies cause this game is great!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Me and my brother play this on are computer and when I saw this I just had to get it
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I highly enjoyed this movie if you enjoy movies with lots of action and a little bit of history in the bond series I would check this movie out I did not think I would like it, but was highly suprised.
B009DTI0IS|5.0|i love this band!! A definite must for all pearl jam fans. This dvd made me love them that much more! Awesome
B008K7RGA2|4.0|I would give this five stars except for Terfel's portrayal of Scarpia as a sex-starved, fat, slobbering, unshaven, evil Falstaff.  Scarpia's power came from his almost effete moral degeneracy.  He was a scheming seducer, not a rapist.  This characterization allows some rather crude singing to spoil some of Scarpia's more subtle lines.  He offers Tosca some &#34;Spanish wine&#34; as if he knows the finer things. Not THIS Scarpia. Thus violating the intention of the composer and the libretto.  In many ways, Baron Scarpia is the most interesting character in the drama.  For all the rest, the singers are nearly from heaven---beautiful people with beautiful voices and a conductor who &#34;knows the score&#34;.  All in all, it's well presented and worth many bravos, despite Terfel.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Beautifully done . I love it .I am so glad I decided to watch this series. The cast is wonderful and the show<br />is visually beautiful as well , the house , the cars the clothes, all serve to portray a time in history<br />little understood ,especially by an American audience. Brilliant!
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|This book outlines a race between computing technology and education to replace or produce the jobs of the future. It provides convincing and current examples of the impact of technology on employment in recent years and extrapolates about even more serious effects in the years ahead. Whilst it is not a pessimistic book it is less convincing about solutions than it is about the problem.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of Thrones season 2.... Blu-ray.... They work, they play. If you like Game of Thrones you'll like this. Woot
B000002J5K|5.0|Being from Chicago I can't help but love this movie and the soundtrack just brings you right back to that time.  Oddly enough they had a midnight showing of the Blues Brothers at the Tivoli in Downers Grove.  It doesn't get much better than this!
B0093COK4S|5.0|If you are a long time Sandra fan or a brand new one you will love this album.  I was very late in hearing Sandra for the first time in 2004.  I quickly added each of her albums to my collection.  It is not often that you come across such an established artist and find that you love every single album in their career but that's how it turned out.  Since then I have bought each CD as they were released.  I have to say that hands down this is my absolute favorite.  Both the original and the remix disc are amazing.  If you are a fan of Sandra and a fan of 80's beats you will not be able to stop hitting repeat on this one.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I haven't payed much attention to Bond after Roger Moore was retired.  I gave this one a shot and was really impressed with all the action.  The cinematography was amazing, the locations, the stunts ... just amazing!  Highly recommended!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the challenge of this game. The only problem is that there is only ten floors. I would love for this game to add more floors so I could be entertained for hours at a time.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I'm a recent YouTube fan and this girl's rise to fame is pretty amazing!  This is one talented girl, the music stands alone but ... combine that with her visuals and you've really got something!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|You shouldn't see this movie/waste your time, but you will...and the makers knew it.  Heck, I watched it even after reading the dismal reviews so who am I to judge?  But I'm tellin' ya, don't do it!<br /><br />At the risk of repeating what others have said, it's dark and hard to see, which is, oh, I dunno, maybe Movie Making 101:  \\"Allow Your Viewers To Actually See What's Going On\\".  If Spielberg was going for a somber, dreary, old photo kinda thing, he accomplished that but he did it so well that it's like being locked in a dusty closet.  Movie Making 101A might be, \\"Let Your Viewers HEAR Your Movie Properly\\".  The sound levels go from a soft whisper to a loud, dramatic, forced sound so that I was constantly adjusting the level on my laptop and that's also ridiculous and hurt my ears.  If visual and audio are not handled well, a good, strong story can save any movie, really.  But, nope, not here.  It's really true.  The movie should've been called \\"The 13th Amendment: How It Worked\\" and slapped into high school civics classes the world over.  (With the unfortunate subtitle:  Lincoln, A Laff A Minute!)<br /><br />The only good thing in the movie is Daniel Day Lewis himself.  Perfect Lincoln and a remarkable actor!  A+++ for you.  But, the story line is so choppy and impossible to follow that I gave up and slept for about 20 minutes and when I awoke, it made no difference that I'd missed a chunk of the movie.  It was still grinding its painfully slow way towards the 13th Amendment.  Lincoln's death scene, or should I say LACK of a proper death scene is unforgivable.  They actually show another play going on in another theatre when the announcement of the shooting comes!  I'm not kidding.  To make him look like a buffoon with his lame jokes at inappropriate times is also unforgivable for such a man.  All in all, I'm furious when the subject matter has such grand potential and the seemingly best are on task to tell the story and then it falls apart.  What ARE you guyssmoking up there in Hollywood?  I mean that with all sincerity.<br /><br />Just don't go.  Be the brave one who doesn't care if you don't see the Latest, Greatest Spielberg movie so that you can make up your own mind.  Do it for movie makers everywhere who really do do their jobs and thrill us.  No more bowing and scraping to Spielberg.  Not after this travesty.  Luckily, there are a lot of wonderful alternatives available if you want to know the story of Abraham Lincoln.  This movie isn't one of them.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|A good game to play for all ages but still just another strategy knockoff just like the rest if you want to advance you have to pay money.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Loved it, just as good as the Shopaholic books! I'm a big fan of Kinsella and this one might be one of my favorites.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great fun! Very entertaining, hope to see more rooms soon. An addictive game. Wish there were more rooms. Waiting for more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun and easy to play.  I enjoy playing these types of games and the graphics aren't bad either.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can't wait for next room. my 11 year old loves the mind challenge. hoping to find more games like this one.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|All the disks are in perfect shape and played week on our blue-ray.  These classics are fun to own.  Highly recommended to Star Wars fans!
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|James Altucher has done it all, made a fortune, lost a fortune, remade a fortune, lost it again. He is wise about how to start your own business in a very unique way and doesn't pull any punches.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|This season continues the ~ one kill per episode with all the surrounding drama of who Dexter hides his dark passenger from and who knows, or suspects, of it. In the past, those that knew or suspected did not have much of a future. Looking forward to the release of the final season (8); what will be Dexter's fate and who will be caught up with him.<br />Michael C. Hall continues his award-winning portrayal. This season all regular cast are excellent with especially good story line for Jennifer Carpenter and Lauren Vélez. David Zayas, C.S Lee, James Reader, Desmond Harrington and Aimee Garcia give performances true to character. One season guests: Yvonne Strahovski, Ray Stevenson, Jason Gedrick all portray their characters excellently. A few James Dokes scenes get replayed.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Very funny love it works well on my tablet. Everyone I show love to play with it. Have fun with it.
B00CH3QLG0|5.0|Great album, period. Purchased the vinyl. However there is no Download Card or Auto-Rip available from the record label when purchasing the wax. I assumed there would be as there is with most new Vinyl.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Combining the old west with sci-fi and somehow working out.<br />If you liked Will Smiths &#34;Wild, Wild West&#34; then I don't see you having a problem with this show.<br />Overall a nice action packed movie typical of Harrison Ford type adventures.<br />The only thing that would make this better, in my opinion, was if they made it in 3D.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Use this for when traveling, alarm is easy to use and different sounds you can set to.Love that screen displaying stays on the whole time, so if you wake up at night can still see what time it is.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|The film is kind of a chick flick (girl meets boy, boy doesn't eat girl immediately, love conquers all, blah blah blah).  On the other hand the comedy was sufficient to keep me placated through the entire film.  A good &#34;date nite&#34; compromise.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington crafts a powerful performance as Whip Whittaker, a pilot who has put his life on autopilot as substance abuse derails his personal life. The controls of a jumbo jet are well within Whip's superb control, despite a serious alcohol and cocaine addiction. A functioning alcoholic, Whip's personal life and career success are disjointed pieces of a puzzle that begin to form a picture of a flawed, sometimes unlikeable, often endearing, heroic, and complex man. On the fateful morning that begins the film, Whip is hungover after drinking the night away with a stewardess. In the early morning light of a hotel room, Whip faces a telephone argument over child support with his ex-wife and has a line of coke to start the day off right in preparation for work. In the cockpit later that day, it's clear that Whip is a natural- while his type A copilot freezes up during in-flight turbulence, Whip takes command of the situation, and all appears right. Steadying his nerves afterwards with a couple of small vodkas from which Whip concocts his own in-flight screwdriver, the jet hurtles forward until more turbulence is hit. What enfolds during and after the fateful flight comprise the movie's plotline. But the real plotline is a man struggling to find his integrity and sobriety, and what the definition of truth is that he can face up and live with. A spectacular cast, soundtrack, script, and film, \\"Flight\\" is not  for the faint-hearted or those who want escapist entertainment. This film is about the struggles of life, and the complex realities inherent in it.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|An absolute must read and a life changing perspective on the way people think. Extremely practical with plenty of examples and well written.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I watched the movie first and did not read any reviews for it. I did hear this movie wasn't that good, but I gave it a shot anyways. Not surprised that there are mostly negative reviews than positive reviews on here. Anyways, let's get on with my review.<br /><br />I thought this movie does have the story going for it, but you really have to \\"pay attention\\" to what is being said in the beginning of the movie. If you miss anything from what they told you at the start, then most likely, you're going to get a little lost into it. The story is very interesting. Earth is slowly becoming an inhabitable planet, and so, the military made a department division called, \\"The Rangers core\\". The Rangers go out and try to locate a new planet for Earth's people to live on. Eventually, they did find a new planet, Nova Prime, and the people of Earth move relocate there. They do find out that they were not alone on the planet. The Aliens of that world try to kill the humans by creating these new huge monsters that can locate humans and kill them off. The monsters cannot see and are blind, but they can smell fear and that's the only way they can locate the humans.<br /><br />I'm thinking that it's strange that the humans don't use guns on the monsters as they don't even try to shoot it. I can only assume that guns have no affect on the monsters...right? Then, again, humans at that point should have powerful laser power guns, but they don't even try that. They don't try bombs or anything. Instead, what they have is Will Smith with a two-sided blade weapon going in and hack and stash his way to victory for the humans. Will Smith has an ability to have no fear against these monsters. The ability is called \\"Ghosting\\". If you can forget that they don't have guns or any advance weaponry in this movie and just use their concept of ghosting than maybe you're like this movie. I can't really - it's just too dumb.<br /><br />Jadan Smith character is very strong physically, but mentally he's unstable and falls apart in front of danger. This is because the alien's monster killed his big sister when he was only a child. He wants to be like his father, a General in the military and original ranger that invented ghosting. Jadan often doesn't see his father, and so, he doesn't really know him well. Jadan does still looks up to him a lot though. In the movies, I like Jadan playing his funny side with for his characters. I don't think he plays scared acting or fierce/strong acting well. He just doesn't seem to pull it off well.<br /><br />Now basically, the story of this movie is very simple and easy to make.  There are no characters besides Will and Jadan after the beginning of the movie. Every character would be a flash back after that, so pretty much 90% of the whole movie is just those two guys on the screen. I don't really like that and wanted to see more than just these two guys.<br /><br />The rest of the story is Will taking to Jadan on his last mission as General before retirement. They need to take a ship and just go to a planet and Will trains the new rangers about ghosting there. Simple, right.  Well it's not. A twist is when we see that they bring the human killing monster with them on the ship. That's because they want to use it for training there. Somehow the ship gets damage and they need to make emergency landing before it's too late. The closes planet is Earth, which we now know that it is inhabitable planet, but there is no other choice. The ship blows up just before the landing and it crashes onto Earth. Jadan is unhurt in the crash, but Will can't move. Will's legs are broken and everyone else is dead. Now, Jadan has to go get help by traveling to retrieve a bacon at the tail end of the ship, and that's 100 kilometers away from them. The bacon will send out a search and recuse signal to the Rangers for help.<br /><br />Jadan journey is a simple task, but NOT supposed to be easy. Jadan isn't use to Earth's gravity, there are dangers animals andinsects everywhere, the air isn't breathable, and finally, the alien's human killing monster is lose and ready and waiting to kill! Jadan. Jadan has help from his father, and gives him a backpack. The backpack has cameras that lets Will sees and hears what Jadan may or may not see or hear. Also, he has breathing devices that let's him breath the toxic air for a short period of time, but he needs to keep on using them throughout the movie. Finally, he has Will's two-sided blade weapon that can change to multiple different styles.<br /><br />Now, some people may think this is an action movie, but there isn't that much action in this one. This movie shouldn't be in that action category at all, and it should only put in the Sci-Fi section. The action is down to the bare minimum. It is mostly about Jadan talking about himself to his father, and how scared he is doing this task. But through this, they also learn much about each other and how they both react in the same situation different. Remember, the father has NO FEAR, but his son is totally afraid of everything. In a way, it's like a father trying to teach his son how to do his job. Of course, the son doesn't get it at first and takes time for him to learn the job. I see what they try to do in the movie and that's great writing.<br /><br />Everything is done in CGI. All the monsters and locations are supposed to be sci-fi, so it's understandable that it would be like that. It's not the best CGI I seen, but it would do for this movie.<br /><br />After watching this movie, I thought it's not that good. I wouldn't even say it's average. It started out great with the story they built up (forgetting about advance weaponry they should have), but they couldn't keep on delivering with the rest of the movie. It needed to be longer. They needed more background story. The plot needed to be bigger and better. They needed more characters!!! This movie could had been 4 or 5 stars, but it was the bare minimum to a even better movie that could had been.<br /><br />I do NOT recommend this movie.
0307743659|3.0|The Shining started out with some good ideas, and has a few creepy and well-written scenes, but for the most part, it simply didn't hold my interest. It's easily 100 pages too long. The Shining is also not that scary. The movie isn't great, but it's significantly better, in my opinion. The Shining may not be my least favorite, but it's  easily the weakest of the novels I've read by King in terms of storytelling and suspense. The novel is very slow for a horror novel. I didn't like Firestarter or Dolores Claiborne all that much, but they both are more absorbing novels.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great app, it really gets you thinking & tests the mind. My 8 year old son loves it too. Need more rooms asap please.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I watched it without much expectation but it turned out to be an excellent movie.  Jennifer Lawrence was perfect for the lead.  I love science fiction/ fantasy and it was worth watching.  now waiting for the second movie.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this is a really fun game and its really addicting I could play all day I would really recommend this game
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This is on my teenage daughters kindle. She says it works fine. Pretty high praise from her. Fine is a lot better than what she usually has to say. A winner in my book!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I keep getting the message that my download will start automatically.  I get the message it has started, I get the notification that theownload is complete.  I cannot view Longmire on A&E because I need the Adobe Reader.  I have tried to download many times.  Still no Adobe Reader availaible when I try to view the TV program.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is as expected. We already have it for the iPad and iPod touch, so this version for kindle fire is more of the same. My kids really like it, although it is not really a game I care for in any platform.
1426308469|5.0|This is an ideal young child book (3-10).  My son got this for his 4th birthday and loves the pictures and the stories.  Dinosaurs are his favorite--I think little boys are hardwired to like them!  There is enough information that is over his head that I think it will hold up for several years before he outgrows it.
0761169431|5.0|This has many hours of cool origami fun! I bought this for my son, who is a Star Wars nut. He really liked this. The origami ranges from easy to hard. Would get it again if there were other versions.
B001FB55YE|5.0|I consider this to be Guy Ritchie's best effort so far.  Its a fast paced fun story with a villain with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever (well played by Tom Wilkinson).  It has the incomparable Mark Strong playing lawful evil, the lovely Gerard Butler as a slightly bumbling but lucky petty thief, and Toby Kebbell as the center of the film.  Exciting interwoven storylines make this a movie that requires attention--and keeps it easily.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Have been fans since the very beginning. We love the fact we can watch these again and again at home with all of the seasons on disc. Loads of laughs as a family here.
B00CWV8X04|3.0|Not a bad movie but I feel the twist was revealed too early and the rest after that was expected.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game. Gets challenging as you get up in levels. Really interesting game. I like it and so does my thirteen year old daughter.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It really is a good game for what you pay. It keeps you mind thinking the whole time. Get and you will be happy you did.
B003ZDZ22U|5.0|Hannah has true talent and she gives amazing advice to the audience.her song true friend is amazing.go hannah montana.she is a great pop sensation!
1490313370|5.0|As a young individual, I have often found myself wondering &#34;What do I want?&#34; or &#34;What do I want to do with my life?&#34;<br /><br />I've spent the last couple of years being towed along with the idea that I'll grow up and find some job that makes me happy, but I've always felt unsure about it. I've never felt confident that I'd find something that I'd love doing, if I had to have it as a day job. This book has given me hope.<br /><br />Utilizing the tools of creativity, mental health, and entrepreneurship, Altucher has given me a guiding light to how to invest in myself, how to build my ideas, feel more confident in myself, and how to, indeed, choose myself. Altucher is direct but gentle, smart and conversational in his writing, making the book engaging and interesting. I would recommend it for anyone, young to old, because the advice will remain constant throughout the ages. I will read it again, and share it with my friends and loved ones. A fantastic read, and a worthwhile purchase.
B00821OX98|5.0|Noah Wyle made a good choice after ER.  This show has good writing, and good acting.  With an interesting concept of Alien Invasion, and how would we survive.  Could we fight back.  A great show in the &#34;Walking Dead&#34; type of style, but yet different enough to stand on it's own merits.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Whether it's Mickey Haller or Harry Bosch, Mr. Connelly always delivers a taught, suspenseful and literate drama.<br />I hate putting it down until I'm done.
B00B23O96A|2.0|Way too random and too far away from what he does best.  It was nice, however, to hear &#34;Goodnight Irene&#34; as I remember dancing to the Weavers version when I was a little girl!
B006WXW098|4.0|Intensity, accuracy, emotion are all here.  This is a remarkable young performer.  I look forward to hearing more about her and from her in the future.
B006IYG5HE|1.0|Plodding and difficult to follow the story line-not that I could detect a story line. I quit half way through because it was so boring. I read &#34;The Snowman&#34; first and it was so good. Thought I'd try another Harry Hole mystery. Sure picked the wrong one for number 2.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I love survival craft it is the best game ever more than minecraft.When I start to play I feel so free.So I think anyone who is very creative should get this game.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not as good as A Thousand Splendid Suns or Kite Runner.  It was OK, but I wouldn't recommend it.  It goes ito the lives of several different characters and I expected them all to merge at the end, but it was more like 9 short, and not so exciting, stories. Disappointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There Are Some Great Shows Out There Right Now And This Is definitely one You Don't Want To Miss! Perfect Mix Of Historic Drama AnD Comedy. You'll Easily Fall In LOve With Every Character.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|Husseini tends to lead you through the same path in each of his books. Horrible things happen to good people and yet these people are strong enough to make it through. Both his first two books are quite uplifting and great quick reads. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book. Best book ur read in years! In a way it reminded me a twilight just without the vampire thing, but the same kind if love going on.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|My friend loves Hello Kitty, so I got this to go on her desk at work. Was well put together, and very cute. She loves it.
0374203032|5.0|An excellent book describing the present greed in USA by the corporate chieftains. These so called corporate top officers do not believe in the welfare of the country.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|Just hate that in have to buy coins..I wish they would stop this practice.Makes the game not worth playing.If rather just buy out right and play.
B008XGW1CI|4.0|I ended up loving this book, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone. That being said, it took a good 100, 150 pages to really get into the story. I almost stopped reading twice. So glad I didn't though! By page 200, I couldn't put it down!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I enjoyed the story, the characters, Rick Riordan weaves a good tale!<br />looking forward to the next Heroes of  Olympus!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I never book without checking on Tripadvisor first. I also love to get ideas for trips from other travelers in the forum sections.
B00081U7HC|5.0|Just one of those &#34;feel good&#34; movies.  To see that a rich, handsome man, could possibly develop a true love for a &#34;hooker&#34; is a stretch, but does show that even someone from &#34;the other side of town&#34; can clean up and be classy.<br /><br />Good acting, good humor and good music.
B008OE05IG|4.0|If you love sushi then it is a must see. My only complaint was that they had only one food critic guiding you through the whole movie. I was hoping that it would have been more food critics describing their experience there. Other than that they hit every major subject in this movie, the past, the present, and the future. From family life to wildlife conversation. The time goes by quick in this movie.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is another movie with a &#34;twist.&#34;  Even though their engagement begins as a &#34;business&#34; arrangement, Sandra Bullock's character eventually &#34;come around&#34; to the softer side of herself.  Nice love story, good cast, cute humor!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|LOVED IT,  There are so few stories about seniors.  It shows them as regular people with baggage and the ability to still be deeply in love.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great for all ages. My 4 year old son plays it, and so do I! Just wish there was a way we could compete against each other at the same time!
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|The plot was a good one but the visual effects where hard on the eyes. I actually got a slight headache from watching this movie. There were times in the movie where they had the camera view of both worlds up and down sides that was hard to watch. Even had a few shots that didn't involve the other planet but they decided to have the shot upside down to show they were viewing the people from the upside world. I didn't see a need for it. We know who was from the downside and who was from the upside from the beginning.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I Needed new charger since I lost mine. (Or so i thought). Works just fine and charges pretty quick, Even while I'm using Kindle. I found my original charger the day my new charger came in mail...that's just my life though. Quick shipping considering it came from Hong Kong! packaged with care.
B009AMANBA|5.0|It was historical.  Daniel Day-Lewis was Lincoln.  I would recommend it to everyone.  I learned things I should have learned in school.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|My only complaint is that the sound effects are too loud/voices are too quiet. I watched this movie with headphones in and was constantly taking them out because the sound effects and music were too overwhelming and if I was turning the sound down instead, I wasn't able to hear what they were saying.<br /><br />Other than that, this movie was not disappointing in the least. I love it for the superhero movie that it is. I highly recommend to any who like this genre of movie (mythological fictional adventure with morale).
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great acting and great story lines.  I am so glad I found this show!  I hope the next seasons are as good as the first.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I had accidentally given away my copy of this movie.  The other day I thought of the music, realized what had happened and had to rush to reorder.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Quick, smart and hilarious! I tore through this book v quickly, over a long weekend. At times disturbing but it only adds to the overall story. Quite wonderful though not life changing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great fun. A little game that gets addictive and is great for on the throne. Guys you know what I mean.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|From what I heard this app is really good, so I bought it... Well, its not loading... Has anyone else had this problem? I really would like to play...
B0001I561E|2.0|I only received one disc and it wasn't the movie.  It was only the special features.  Not a happy surprise.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Finally, another book by the master. A crafted masterpiece of spy work filled with weird English spy characters, unpredictable plots with twists and turns but all heading in one direction. And the inevitable upper crust aristocracy manner of speaking that is so delightful to the Americans. This is really one of his better books and I recommend it to all. Up to date and plausible. Don't pass this one by.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun game, and quite addictive. Good for everyone. Love the fact that I can switch players, plus they are boosters along the way.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is one if the funniest games I've played. It's easy to learn and hard to put down. Best part is its free. If your looking g for something to kill some time with I suggest this one you won't regret it.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Seriously well delivered by one of the best electronica groups ever! a little change in theme from for example TRON, but in good Daft Punk style, this album makes you move!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book is well written, but somehow something personal is missing when I compare it to Benjamin Carson's writing.<br />I strongly recommend it to anyone ever doubting Heaven, particularly medical Doctors.<br />The book gives hope and peace to Christians that feel they have to earn Heaven, Dr. Alexander explains what happens when everything in your body shuts down, it may be the end of the life we know, but it is not the end of the soul.<br />Christine C. May
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Lots of fun and challenging, but great for my grandson too! I can't wait for more doors. Thanks!
B00190OHD6|4.0|Usually you cry at the end of movies, I cried all the way through it. If you're not looking for a tear jerker, just say no.
0451232852|5.0|All I want to do is read and think about it.  Follet's books are always wonderful but this one is special.  I will read the other two in the series.
B000FC1IPO|5.0|This book is hilarious, serious, sensitive, and makes for delightful reading. Kate Reddy has a tough job in the financial world of London -- a man's world--and those men want to keep it that way. She's good at her job and loves it, but also wants to shine as the mother of a young daughter and toddler son. Her patient husband, with good reason, becomes less patient. All the characters are marvelously drawn. You will root for Kate to find a way to &#34;win&#34; in a world where the odds are stacked against her. The ending is clever and satisfying.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This movie was excellent! Except for the fact that I didnt read it was rated R. I showed this to my kids without watching it first, and boy were we in for a surprise in the beginning! haha.
B00AALHW6Y|4.0|If you like Darius' other music, you'll love this one as well.  Although he's \\"gone country\\" this is not the twangy type of country that many people hate.<br />This is just good, fun Darius country.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book had me GLUED to it it made me soooooo emotional and I was mad sad and ecstatic at the turn of events constantly you neeeeeeeed to read this book
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed the game wish. but i wish that this game had more levels. I hope they make updates fast for this game. I'm glad it was free.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This was a really great book! It keeps you guessing the whole time. It was an amazing sequel to The Lost Hero.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Excellent new SciFi with compelling characters and some nice twists. Watched 2 seasons and looking forward to a third season.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I could not stop watching it. Missed the first two seasons so I watched them on prime and now catching up on current season
B001NLKZUA|5.0|City of Ashes was an amazing book and I loved it so much. It's characters just got better and Jace! JACE IS AMAZING AND SO IS MAGNUS
B008KGPEQG|5.0|Paul Auster's book sublimely fulfills itself like a person who has truly become actualized. the person Paul Auster ,my brother, is<br />equally as amazing and fufilling to travel with.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to try to understand it and to journey way beyond the norm or commonsense.
B00BU18U82|5.0|I have only played for a short time, and it is a lot of fun. The only thing I would change is adding a co-op and Cargill grain storage company style unloading. What I mean is, you pull across the scale at the scale house and then pull through the grain elevator and dump in the pit. You could show people in the elevator dumping the grain weather it is an end dump or a farm semi truck.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app use it everyday. can have a challenge and a no brainer if I want that. very portable game
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well worth reading. Very well written and creative.  I liked it so much that I'm encouraging my husband to read it and we usually have very different tastes in books but this one easily appeals to both of us.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|All I can say is this, a twist of paranormal meets Native Americans in a parallel world. How can you not love that? I was never lost or even confused in this book. I loved it, down to the last page... Even though I spent a good five minutes trying to swipe at the screen for the next page that wasn't there, and I knew it just didn't want to admit it. I just wanted one more page.... Well done!  Looking forward to more!!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|The beauty of great fiction is that dreams are given a life on the page for everybody to experience in their own way. Like the greatest of dreams, Gaiman's Ocean leaves the reader wanting so much more. I want to put my head back on the pillow and continue to have questions answered and experiences with these great characters. Also like the best of dreams, I hope the Hempstock's return someday.<br /><br />A quick beautiful read that stands as a great testament to the memories we have of childhood, and the changes that happen to all of us every day.
B000V63CGM|5.0|A must have for any music lover.  The whole album is filled with wonderful music, with Feels So Good as the ultimate prize.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love the armor in the game it's so amazing,  my favorites are iron patriot, heartbreaker, and the mark 3.
1452101248|5.0|My brother couldn't stop talking about how much he loved the unique recipes and the photos in this cookbook his friend highly recommended. He said he can't wait to make the simple, yet delicious dishes featured in his new cookbook.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love everything about this game its fun and easy the characters u use are awesome its interesting to play and it does not take much skill I would recommend this game to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome game. Love it. Can not believe that it is free. Would have paid for it but it is free so that is even better.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Part international thriller, part social critique, and entirely a fantastic read. A great page turning international business thriller this tale of crime & revenge is set in the world of international manufacturing & finance. It at the same time makes a bold statement about social morays, the subculture world, and takes a critical look at perversion, abuse, & the underbelly of modern society even as it exists among those deemed most &#34;respectable&#34;. A fantastic read.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Fantastic TV Series, but the books are better! Once you start reading, it is hard to put down, you can so easily visualise what the author is describing, it is as if you are right there, watching, listening, almost able to touch, the scenes and people around.
B00A6RCSKC|2.0|I bought a hero and it said there was an error and it took the coins but it didn't give me the hero.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Very easy ebook reader to use, I much prefer this to most others I have tried, recommend it to anyone.
B001WCN232|4.0|NOTE: Early buyers of this disc got ripped off! \\"Star Star\\" features a mangled censor of \\"lick the <> clean\\" that was only released on the initial American LP of the album and corrected ever since until the first Universal remaster. It is now corrected, but there is no way to tell which one you will get based on the packaging. The record label just snuck in the right version. NO FANFARE  BE CAREFUL BUYING THIS ALBUM USED!<br /><br />GOAT'S HEAD SOUP is a great album but coming after the succession of BEGGAR's BANQUET, LET IT BLEED, STICKY FINGERS, and EXILE ON MAIN STREET, it does not hold up to their standards. Still there is much to like on this album. \\"Dancing With Mr. D\\" keeps their devilish reputation alive with a vintage Stones' guitar riff laden rocker. The second track, \\"100 Years Ago\\" is one of the most unique and satisfying songs on the album, driven by Billy Preston's funky clavinet and Mick Taylor's blazing guitar, it's still country at heart, and when Mick and Keith sing out \\"lazy bones\\" you're already captured in the mood.<br /><br />Keith Richards' contribution to the album, \\"Coming Down Again,\\" draws from his association with Gram Parsons. It has some sounds reminiscent of Partsons' \\"New Soft Shoe,\\" but is more firmly in the rock camp with Nicky Hopkins superb piano and sn interesting sax exchange between Jim Horn and Bobby Keys.<br /><br />\\"Heartbreaker\\" is one of the album's most familiar songs, a Stones rocker funked up with some Billy Preston keyboards, and what was side one of the original LP closes out with \\"Angie,\\" a ballad featuring some fine acoustic guitar, Nicky Hopkins' piano, and a prissy string arrangement.<br /><br />The second side would open with \\"Silver Train,\\" a nice fast tempo blues rocker showcasing Mick Taylor's slide guitar but nicely supported with some fine boogie-woogie piano from Ian Stewart. From here comes the material that makes this album truly inferior to its recent past. \\"Hide Your Love\\" is largely Mick on the piano singing the blues -- total throw away. \\"Winter\\" is a nice but somewhat lifeless Van Morrison style ballad. It's a little too long and rambles a bit. \\"Can You Hear the Music\\" has an interesting horn arrangement but by 1973, psychedelia was over as if the reaction to THEIR SATANIC MAJESTIES REQUEST didn't give the Stones that message.<br /><br />This is an album all Stones fans would have, but for the rest, it's still a nice one to have. As an album, it's okay, but some of its songs are absolutely delightful though none are regular Stones' concert material.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great acting, interesting story line, and  intense action interspersed with funny scenes. Highly recommend for any syfy lover. Wait past the credits for preview of things to come.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I would give it a higher rating if there wasn't so many download problems.Also lag time on loading friend and gifting.
B00973902K|5.0|I remember hearing this song in a bar when I was playing pool & never found out what it was until 2 weeks ago, I love it! It reminds me of my amazing boyfriend. Buy it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game!  Would recommend to any solitaire fan.  Give it a try, you won't regret it!  Fun, fun, fun for sure
B004H83IM8|5.0|A great set for the Austin Powers fans. We laughed out loud even though we have seen each movie 10 times<br />Classic!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is a great way to understand history and culture from the past<br />in an interest and fun way.<br />Nothing like a history book..<br />Captivating story lines, many unexpected twists and turn involving the lives<br />of many characters... never a dull moment!!<br /><br />DD
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|My  kids  love  to  play  angry  birds.  It keeps  them  occupied  while  I  do  housework.They  can  also  play  it  on  long  drives  in  the  car.
B00C7JGDBW|2.0|DVD review for \\"Oz The Great and Powerful\\"<br /><br />\\"Oz The Not So Great and Unpleasant\\"<br /><br />I watched this DVD wanting to get some inside information on the development of the characters. That was sorely missing, replaced by a world of special effects technology.  This was a prequel, yet the comparisons are going to be made with the 1939 very popular original classic \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"<br />James Franco the actor who plays the Wizard of Oz in the recent released DVD, has taken heat as being miscast. The problem with the film does not lie on Franco's shoulders as an actor. It is the result of inept screenplay writing.  The writers here give us an unlikable con-artist, hustling character that the audience cannot have sympathy for when he (Oz) gets into trouble. With Dorothy of the original film, she captured your heart and you cared for her in the film.<br /><br />Another problem with the film is that the land of Oz, was a figment of Dorothy's imaginative dream. Here in the latest film, Franco's character experiences almost the same scenario that Dorothy did in her dream in the original film. And like the original 1939 film, we have the same early black and white scenes and the same approaching tornado that quickly swoops up Franco's character the magician from Kansas to the land of Dorothy's imagination and dream. That's just it!  It was a dream not reality. Yet here director Sam Raimi tries to have us believe that both Kansas and Oz are both real.  Couldn't happen! How could a young Oz be in the same dream world Dorothy had some sixty years before she was born?<br /><br />All the people that Dorothy knew in real life, were recreated as different characters in her dream. Including the old magician that she met in Kansas, and who she later dreamt as The Wizard of Oz. The magician character and OZ are two very separate entities, the magician in Kansas and later the Wizard of Oz.  Yet here in the latest film the magician and Oz are portrayed as one person, hedoes not wake up and all is  dream, no Raimi here makes the mistake of making the land of Oz real, Oz never leaves Oz.<br /><br />Now, if this a faithful prequel history before Dorothy. How is she going to meet the old magician in Kansas who became the Wizard of Oz in her fantasy dream? She can't because director Raimi left him stuck in Oz.  So Raimi is trying to make us believe that both Kansas and Oz are equally real. That cannot be possible!<br /><br />Another big problem is that two sister witches played by Mila Kunis and Rachael Weisz are wasted. All they do is bicker back and forth, and do an unnecessary battle with Glinda (played by Michelle Williams as the good witch) that came across as phony looking. Raimi should have delved more in depth into letting us know who these characters are the how they became the powerful witches they are, who they later became the witch sisters from the East and West.  Mila Kunis with green face makeup is not a micro-fraction as frightening as the original wicked witch of the West played magnificently by Margaret Hamilton. Kunis looks too cartoonish as the green witch and does not have the evil persona that Hamilton possessed for that role.<br />And those ruby red slippers? \\"A huge part of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" Come on you know they're going to remake it! Raimi had the chance to let us know all the backstory which is what a prequel is supposed to do. Here it does not succeed.  The latest Oz edition has strong special effects yet a very very weak story.<br /><br />Ron Keneske
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|great fun for all. time killer for sure. especially at the doctor if it is late and you have to wait
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Easy read, overall good book. It was simple to follow, ended some what fast. Leaves you asking what happens next
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Don't like this game at all.  Don't understand how it's supposed to be played. You're suckered into getting it for free then you have to upgrade at a cost.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Love the app. A great way to be able to use and see my YouTube movies on my new kindle fire hd
B00000ING2|5.0|Tim Robbins and the Coen Brothers!  I knew it couldn't miss.  Laughs and entertainment.  Like all other Coen Brothers productions. . .I can't just watch it once.
B0091W7MP4|5.0|I liked the suspense, action this movie had, I would recommend this movie because it keeps you watching till the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really cool. My daughter and I had a ball with this. Really puts your mental to the challenge. Also helps cure boredom.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|In some albums the only songs worth listening to are the hit singles, but with all of Vampire Weekends including this one, all the songs are worth listening to. This album had a lot of variety. Theres really poppy songs but also chill songs. They are all amazing. The different sounds incorporated are so beautiful. It goes to show how versatile Vampire Weekend is. I would venture and say this is their best album yet. I waited two years for this and it was worth the wait.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have never bought a gaming mouse before but this was a good purchase. The ability to change the color of the logo is gimicky, but the mouse works extremely well. The mouse is pretty light without the weights (I prefer this), and it feels pretty heavy with them (thought I've seen heavier).<br /><br />The two buttons behind the mouse wheel are a bit uncomfortable to use, but it's not like I have a need for them anyways.<br /><br />The three side buttons are a huge plus and are really nice in games such as minecraft, so that I have a little faster access to the first three items in my inventory bar. It's also extremely nice to have those buttons in any FPS so that I can quickly change the firing mode on a gun without stretching awkwardly across some keys on my keyboard.<br /><br />This is the best mouse you can get for this price in my opinion.
1781162646|5.0|I got this in paperback at the library, since it isn't available as an ebook yet.  It was so good.  The character development was deep.  Stephen King has mojo.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|I  watched this amazing  series on TV and  couldn't wait to get it on disc in order to  watch it  again.One viewing is not enough to take in  all in.The  series should have won the  best  editing and documentary awards for television. The series does not intend to  include  the entire history of cinema in  only 15 hours but what it does include is essential  viewing  for any student of the cinema.If you love  International and Asian cinema as much as I do,then you will learn so much about cinema's history . This series makes all other series on cinema history second rate in comparison. It is the brilliant narration and editing that  truly makes this series stand out.So much information to take it that  you have to watch it again and again .Brilliant.My only complaint  is that it was not released on bluray.The 43 page booklet that comes with the dvd set it a must read.For those people who did not like it then watch it again.You may be surprised<br />.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is my first review on Amazon but I just felt that I need to chime in on this movie.<br /><br />I watched the movie after it's theatrical run; couldn't find a 2D showing in my area and my girlfriend doesn't do 3D - hurts her eyes. Whoever made the decision to limit the 2D release... well, that was incredibly stupid. While the 3D effects are touted as amazing, this movie does NOT need them to be successful or enjoyable.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I watched this movie on a whim, without really knowing anything about it (critical reviews are borderline useless to me any more now that Roger Ebert has passed on). We were blown away. This movie doesn't waste time on traditional formulas and focuses on being among the best of what it is: An amazing action film that lovers of the golden age of action movies (the 80s and early 90s) will shed a tear of joy to.<br /><br />It doesn't waste time on back story, love interests, or extraneous color. It plows through its story without any fat and provides the most enjoyable action experience I've had in 15 years. The feel is like a modern Robocop or Terminator 1/2 but unlike those movies, there is literally no drag in Dredd. The characters play out through their actions and the run time is perfect to tell the story.<br /><br />The story is minimal, to be sure, but that is what makes it work. We're not saving the world, changing mankind, or creating a watershed moment in the legacy of the people involved. We're storming a building that's on lock down with a brilliantly understated lead character and nearly perfectly balanced supporting cast.<br /><br />The action sequences are obviously well done and look amazing. Add to that a perfectly paced film and a character who easily goes in my top three film badasses of all time and we've got a film worth watching multiple times. Also, did I mention that my girlfriend absolutely loved it? Got the Blu-ray coming later this week and I plan to watch the damn out of it. You should, too.<br/><br />tl;dr - Buy it. Watch it. Support it. Let's get a sequel and set a box office record. You won't be disappointed.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|We watch this movie every 4th of July.  The director created the quintessential blow up movie!  I worry every time that Boomer isn't going to make it into the utility closet.
B00448SE4S|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! If you are not a fan of old-school and new-school video games, then this is not the movie for you. You will sit there not understanding half of the jokes. Although it is still a good comedy without understanding basic Videogame knowledge, It would be more greatly appreciated and be full of more laughs if you understand certain &#34;inside jokes&#34;
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I planned on using this while on vacation, but had the hotel desk use wake up call instead.  I had placed it on my kindle fire, but found the hotel desk was easier.  Would probably be useful in other situations.
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I wish I could have read this novel in the original language; I suspect some of my disgruntledness with it comes from a less-than-superb translation.  I found the subject matter---neo-Nazis, skinheads, WWI, political intrigue--all very interesting, and the villain actually was such an interesting character that I didn't want to believe that he was indeed a villain. This complexity I like. But something was lacking--or was it only because of the translation?  At any rate, I am open to reading more Jo Nesbo--and maybe I'll become a fan!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Started reading this years ago & couldn't get to grips with it & stopped reading it. When the new film came out I thought I'd give it another try & loved it, great book & don't know why I couldn't get to grips with it.
B00CB4ET0K|1.0|Took forever to download on my Kindle, then it would not open. Tried again, same thing. I would give it zero stars if possible.
0545586178|5.0|This book was EXCELLENT! It starts with the backlash of how everyone shows Katniss as the catalyst for the revolution taking place in the districts, she even gets to tour them for her speeches.  Of course, the President warns her that if she does not do something to quell the rebellion he will kill her and everyone she knows.  She soon realizes nothing she can do will make the President happy.  Before she can make up a next move the Quarter Quell games are announced.  Every 25 years the Games take on a new spin to keep the district on their toes, this year 75 they decide to take 2 tributes from each district that have won previous Hunger Games (individuals who thought themselves free of ever having to compete again).
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I just can not stop playing it relaxes me after work ... and  I look forward  to the afternoon to play and relax.. I just absolutely love it. !!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is a family favorite.  Love the characters, especially the Lady Dowager.  Many phrases we've picked up and use in our own home...such fun!  and sadness too; that's why this show is so well liked...very much a 'serial' and the Brits play it off beautifully!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome and challenging. It's great for all occasions. A real good way to pass the time away.
1401207529|5.0|At the ripe old age of 25 i have just started reading comic books.  Having seen the movies and some of the batman cartoons i had a good idea of the Batman origin, but this took it to a whole new level!  Extremely well written and beautifully drawn.  If you're looking for a spot to start, this is it.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Have spent hundreds of dollars on this game  for  my  daughter and it is her favorite. As a mother of a 3 years I feel so bad  b/c it crashes everytime I open it and I don't know why. Her sad litte face. Any reasonswhy?
B000P42A22|3.0|There are many details of the movie that are not entirely correct.  Donovan, Dulles, Covert Ops, all a little messy in their portrayal and presentation.  The flashbacks made it confusing as to when and what was going on.  Skull and Bones was cool, and indicative of that group of elitist people from Yale, Harvard etc.  Bay of Pigs went differently as well, they make it look like Damon is on the ground in Cuba, not Florida or Central America.  Frank Weiner's book, Legacy of Ashes, tells it all correctly.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies that Disney and Pixar have done. I love it and I will watch it over and over.
B008K9SG9K|1.0|I have been buying more music lately and ended up getting many great albums. I heard radioactive and will be seeing the this band at lollapaplooza and thought I'd get the album to enjoy their performance more. It starts with the excellent \\"Radioactive\\" song and then nose dives into the ground. The songs that follow are all dull and uninspired and makes me wonder why this band even matters at all. The production is excessively cheesy and actually makes me feel embarrassed to be listening too. The synths are garbage and the songs just sound like a second-rate coldplay. While the album has one song that shows promise, the rest is just not for me and I was deceived by the sonic delight \\"radioactive\\" is. I have just deleted the entire album save \\"Radioactive\\".
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have really enjoyed all the books in the Sookie series and enjoyed this one just as much. It was a satisfying end of the series for Sookie, her friends and family.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The best jigsaw puzzle I have found on line! The music is a little boring but the puzzles are great.
1591845556|5.0|Gets you off your duff and shows you a road map to accomplishing new things. We all know the 10,000 hours to be a master at something, this book shows you that you only need 20 hours to get going.
B005LAII80|1.0|I thought I was ordering the original Sylvester Stillone Judge Dredd. What I got was the latest remake, and the DVD I received was only suitable for North America and Canada. Amazon refunded my purchase price. Good on Amazon.
B00AZMFO6I|3.0|I really wanted to love this movie. And I did, in a way. By the end of it, I was really touched and left with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. I wish the whole movie could have made those simple emotional connections the same way the eloquent final gesture did. The premise of the film was uttered by a character who, at one point, said something like, \\"Take part! Before you're the guest of honor at the crematorium.\\" And that really sums up what QUARTET was about--that the promise of life, happiness, and love do not end simply because we grow older and our physical beings fade.<br /><br />It's a lovely message. Yet the film seemed to be trying so hard to be serious, to be about big themes, that, at times, it was painfully slow. It could have used a bit more humor and a little less pretense. Its characters could have benefitted from being a bit more zany, so we would like and care about them more. Although I enjoyed the movie for the most part and would recommend it to others, I simply didn't think it had the spark of, say, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, another film with similar characters and themes. The latter had more heart, was more willing to let down its gray hair, and that made it more worthwhile--and fun.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I found the beginning of book to be very good and interesting but found myself skipping some of the court proceedings cause there was so much of it!  Took forever to move along with this book.  The ending however did surprise me.  I would recommend this book for those who like to read pages and pages of court proceedings.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun if you enjoy thinking and puzzle solving.<br />Way too short in its corrent form.<br />Hopefully there is more to come soon.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I don't know what it is about this game but I am in love with it. Such a simple concept, popping a balloon, and yet I HAVE to beat each track. I have Eng. Building on kindle, Mage Building on phone and Dart Building on itouch. I look forward to even new tracks.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I got this as FAOTD, but showed this to a friend who felt it was worth the $1.99 (I agree) and bought it on the spot. Beautiful and very relaxing. Love it!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I read the first book in this series prior to the release of the 'Hunger Games' movie because it seemed to be so popular with youth and I wondered how it could remain so long on bestseller lists.  After seeing the 'Hunger Games', I expected a bent toward the 'V for Vendetta' perspective on modern society in general and alleged democratic governments in general.  Imagine the disappointment at reading this the second book in the series.  It turns our this is a great series for youths because it is geared toward a younger immature audience.  I wish it had aspired to greater heights but that's how it goes...
B00APYKXFS|1.0|I am so very grateful that I had the oppertunity to try out this game for no cost but I did not approve of the price or the controls save your money and save it to get a descent game like  Where's my water or Cut the rope games worth your valuable money.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Recommended to us and we were not sorry. Totally addicted. Excellent acting and well chosen for their parts.  Gives a accounting of what life was like in medieval times with some added magic.
B00DHNBY02|5.0|This is one of the only remakes out there that deserves to be made.  Great addition to the Evil Dead series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun and slightly challening game. It's great for people who like puzzle games, and it's suitable for all ages.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I love Jeffrey Archer's writing. Great story and enjoyed all the characters. Left you hanging at the end so I can't wait for the next book. Would recommend this series to any friend.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I have loved this since the first time I saw it many many years ago.  I obtained this copy for my grand daughter who loves it as well.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I don't know, but it doesn't seem like she wrote this book. I've had it for weeks now and can't even get to the halfway mark!. I'll force myself to finish it but do yourself a favor and start rereading the Harry Potter series
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loved the game! Made you think but not impossible to figure out, just use the hints if needed and reason it out.  Loved it can not wait for the next one!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I'll be honest, I nerd out when it comes to Final Fantasy games.  And I love that this is available on Kindle.  It's great and definitely worth it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Whole family uses Calculator Plus (three generations). Looks great, easy to read and makes the Kindle Fire that much more a single tool useful anywhere.<br /><br />I recommend Plus too anyone wanting to ditch the old calculator!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|This book is great! Two thumbs up for sure. You can perfectly picture the scenes, people and society of this book within seconds. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I play this game all the time and I never get bored of it. It is easy to level up unlike most games. I recommend this game for all ages.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The story line is exhilarating, but I wish the description wasn't as draggy.<br />Way too many details in every page. I would like to read the next upcoming story but would probably not recommend it to others if it is just like the first 5 books. Wish the story moves faster.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|It has great sound and easy to use. The stylus broke after a month but Sony with a great service send a replacement.
B00003CXBK|5.0|While a bit gruesome at times, I love the story, detailed scenery and characters in Princess Mononoke. Not as mainstream as some of the other Studio Gibli movies but my favorite.
B008XFJEE2|4.0|No, not a movie to watch with your kids, but certainly not porn. Sexy, yes. This time around I spotted the behavioral red flags and appreciated the ending. Not one of my top ten movies, but up there. I would give it.4 1/2 stars  if I could.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The film is quick and to the point: action! The whole movie is a lot of fun even if you have never heard of Star Trek before.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|liked the game but would have appreciated directional instructions as I have not played escape games before this.  Would love for more floor to open up.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is a good game, I had some time to kill and this app was a good way to do it.
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|As if it were done by a modern Richard Wagner.  A composition that tells the story with the music alone...
1582701709|5.0|This book arrived rather quickly and began changing my outlook on life immediately.  I heard about the phenomena of &#34;The Secret&#34; several years ago but I did not buy into it.  If you're on the fence I would definitely recommend this book.  You'll never know until you try :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had not read  book in a while and this was very fun and fast. it is broken up into chapters from her point of view and then from his point of view.
B00792EGES|5.0|LOVE this band and LOVE this Blu-ray!  One of the best bands out there today.  If you haven't heard their music...buy a CD or buy this!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Addictive; have already moved to the second and third books and am &#34;hungry&#34; for more.  My daughter is hooked on them too.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|A GREAT Gabriel Blu-ray!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was great goes along with the other two and I can't wait for the next two to come out so the series will be complete.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This is one of the best Christmas movies of all time! Was so happy to see it on Blu ray!
B006MOW98E|5.0|Ok, some observations: 1) Yes, I laughed out loud while reading this book; 2) Love, love John Green anything 3) it's like A Seinfeld episode, the 3 stories get connected and tied together at the end and you are smiling because of it. Don't wait for winter or Christmas...read it now for an enjoyable ride!
B008BSPQ3E|5.0|This is a MUST HAVE for any Peter Gabriel fan.  Includes great footage and music.  Bought this for my husband as a gift...he LOVES it!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Finally!  A step-by-clear-step book on how to publish your books for eBooks!  &#34;Building Your Book for Kindle&#34; takes the writer from start to finish in easy to follow instructions on how to get the best look for your book!  And most amazingly, the process happens exactly as the book says it should.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who want to publish an eBook!<br /><br />Review by: Rita Kroon, author of &#34;Cancer, a Journey through the Valley,&#34; &#34;Praying the Scriptures,&#34; &#34;Letters from the Past,&#34; and &#34;Womanhood: Becoming a Woman of Virtue&#34;
1451696191|3.0|I was told this was a \\"coming of age\\" story for my generation. Maybe, but Charlie has got to be the weakest character I've read about in a long time. The very end of the book seems positive, but it has the vibe of a suicide note to me. I have no trouble believing he's a nasty remark away from ending it all. I didn't think it was a bad book, I just expected a lot more from the things is heard about it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|We tried watching a similar show on TV and were underwhelmed.  Our son introduced us to Falling Skies on DVD, and we're hooked!  After seeing one episode online with my son, I bought Seasons 1 and 2!  The acting is excellent, the characters are well developed, the suspense is nail-biting, and the action is all anyone could want!
B00847KFDS|2.0|I had high hopes for this C D but after listening to it I feel it is just a desperate money grab.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|It's not bad but not great either. Don't have anything else to say. Just filling up space. How I add that.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Saw it in theaters and had to have it. Wife and I love it, a great movie for any collection.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was a bit slow to start, but once you allow yourself to slow to the authors pace, you begin to enjoy the story. Beautifully written and I look forward to seeing the movie.
1586210661|4.0|not sure why i need to write so much about the product.  my rating says it all sometimes.<br />if you take into account my rating of this product, it may help you on your decision to purchase one identical to this or not.
B00C25TCZ0|5.0|Scott Gorahm did the right thing here renaming the new line up. However, they do resemble THIN LIZZY! The songs aren't revolutionizing the genre, but it is a solid CD with great musicians. No regrets here!
B002XXLKL0|5.0|Burton's batman retains some of the old timey camp but adds great character development. Something i wish Nolan's Batman did a better job at. Also, Michelle Pfeiffer's catwoman is still the best one of all time: psychotic, twisted, conflicted, badass.
B009TSA7MA|5.0|Gotta admit, major Schenker fan and saw this tour and this Blu-Ray represented everything I saw. This isn't the biggest deal on earth, but the Blu-Ray DOES represent what I saw and I was thrilled! It will ALMOST make you feel like you are there and there is good shots of everyone and great sound. If you love Michael Schenker, I highly reccomend it!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Okay here is my input on Fifty Shades of Grey. I have mixed emotions. I am drawn to Christian Grey, a lot of ways he reminds me of Edward Cullen but in a human and very sexual way. Sometimes I hate him and sometimes my heart goes out to him. I guess as an author that's what we want our readers to feel--emotions. I know its an erotica story, but COME ON!!! I am really getting sick of the sex between the two of them. Every other page they are rubbing on each other. *rolls eyes* But when the story gets interesting and the drama starts, I find myself glued to the pages. I am really debating whether to buy the third book. I am getting tired of him saying she's his and her having doubts one second then all hot and bothered by the way his pants hang on his hips. We get that already!! The characters are strong and easy to love but the whole story gets old fast... Believe me I love a good romance with some hot sex, but I guess I am all tired out from theirs. I mean really, shouldn't Ana being walking around bow-legged by now. *rolls eyes. Oops I better watch what I say or Christian will be smacking my ass... O.o
B009ZQJVAK|4.0|Chiwetel Ejiofor performed magnificently in the movie version of Kinky Boots.  He pulled a mediocre cast through an implausible plot to cheers and tears for, of all goals, the success of a shoe factory.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|I found the movie entertaining, but not what I expected. I thought overall the movie was quite slow. I am glad I didn't go to the theater to watch it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. One of my favorites! You should get it for sure! I really don't have any problems with this game! It's very well designed
B008FRFN7A|4.0|It does what it needs to, but some things aren't so easy to print from a tablet and from what I've seen so far you can't tell it to print B&W. I'm assuming there's a way, but haven't figured it out yet.
B008Q0AJA2|4.0|Seeing Jim Carrey in a semi-serious role was a welcome and refreshing change. He actually did a remarkable job with this role. This movie will take you on a roller-coaster of emotion, from happy to sad. The realization I hope you will get, is how much this movie could relate to our lives today; while we are constantly observed by our Orwellian Big Brother.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|Great actors and wonderful performances.  Kudos to Dustin Hoffman on direction.  Good story of aging and various conditions of said situation.
1781162646|5.0|This was a great book, King, but with a twist. Very enjoyable, we could barely put out down. If you enjoy mysteries, this is a great read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love walking dead and to believe that each episode gets better then the next is crazy.  i can't wait to see what they are going to do in season 4. though I will admit....just put Norman Reesus on the screen and I am happy.....love him
0451196716|4.0|I loved them all, but this one surprised me. I read this one (like all the others) years ago. I read \\"Rage\\" first and moved on to \\"The Long Walk\\". I didn't think I wold like it based on the subject but after I was done I knew it was the one story from all four of these novellas that would stand out.<br /><br />Long before \\"The Hunger Games\\" Stephen King wrote a short book about teenagers that are forced to walk... and walk... and walk until they can no longer function, with armed people following them in a vehicle, and dropping from exhaustion could mean your life. A contest where 100 boys must walk with the threat of their lives at stake. This was a different idea and I have never forgotten this one.<br /><br />R. L.

0451197968|3.0|I read the Bachman books in order, and this one was interesting. At the time I didn't know anything about it, I hadn't seen the awful movie yet, didn't even know there was a movie based on any of the Bachman books (except \\"Thinner\\"). If you have seen the movie, forget about it, it was different from this, but this novella was written before reality television was around (at least in the way reality shows are so common now, anyway.) and the concept is good. Not to sure about the intro all the other reviews are talking about, I read this back in the day when The Bachman books included all four stories (which included \\"Rage\\" which I believe Stephen King pulled from publication) and thought all four stories were great, this one was a fun read, it does read a little like an action film - then again what do you expect with a title like \\"The Running Man\\".<br /><br />Read the book, avoid the movie.<br /><br />R.

1932735410|5.0|There are lots of PMP prep materials and courses out there - how to pick?!<br /><br />I have read the PMBOK cover to cover - only to learn that it didn't help me prepare for the real world style questions to expect on the exam.  On May 1 i ordered Rita's book, and on July 5 I passed the PMP test on my first try.<br /><br />If you take the material presented seriously, and work hard - it will be straightforward.  The book takes more of an &#34;understand&#34; methodology, than a memorize methodology.  What does this mean for you?  It means in the weeks leading up to the exam you will have tools and understanding to do your job more effectively.  3 days before the exam I was participating in a meeting where the leader was struggling to make connections in some concepts and before i knew what was happening I had stood up and explained how an affinity diagram could help us organize the ideas, and started drawing one with the meeting's materials.<br /><br />All I had done was what the book told me to do.  By then I had gone through 3 times, done all the activities, played the games, and worked hard.<br /><br />Of course it's your test and you have to own it.  If you were to tour my home today, 2 days after the exam you would still find note pages taped to the wall, large pieces of paper with colored markers indicating my comfort on various topics, and post it notes making things like connections and order of process notes.  If you sit in my car you'll see my old iPod with mp3s recorded on my laptop of key memorization pieces that i played on the drive to and from work.<br /><br />I recommend this book, and especially recommend following the preparation steps outlined in the materials.<br /><br />Good luck.
B0054JELTI|5.0|The movie came in a decent amount of time and was in perfect condition. Not only that, but it was a combo pack that I could not find at Walmart. This item was greatly priced.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Creative, fast paced, excellent story, good character development and the special effects are superb. One of the few recent movies I intend to buy in BluRay for my tangible library.<br /><br />As with other 5 star reviewers, I too am saddened to see this movie bashed but I acknowledge the diversity of perception and right of all to their own view but (what are they using as the criteria for or a reference about good science fiction)?<br /><br />If you consider yourself a person that appreciates sensitive, dramatic, creative, mind challenging SciFi, then take a risk and see this. I am confident you will be pleased you did.<br /><br />Then you too can write a review based on the facts as you see them.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|Lang Lang plays Chopin so beautifully.  His interpretations are spot on.  He sees Chopin as a virtuoso as well as a poet.  That's what Chopin would have liked, I am sure.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I got this as a free app of the day & it is the MOST valuable free app I've ever gotten!
B001P829VY|5.0|I will leave the story to others that fancy themselves writers and just comment on the Blu-ray. The Blu-ray came packaged as advertised. The special features were as promised, I especially enjoyed seeing the newsreel, the vivid color Bugs Bunny cartoon, a short film then the incredible The Treasure of Sierra Madre. The volume was excellent,  the black and white movie had excellent tones, all of which made this a perfect movie going experience. I still have some special features to view. A must have movie for those who love great movies. I will enjoy watching this over and over.

0812993845|2.0|I have read probably all of Sophie Kinsella's books, and was disappointed with this one, almost boring.<br />Put this one in the trash pile. Would not recommend this to anyone.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Downloaded to my Kindle Fire and it is perfect for quick fixes on photos that didn't turn out too well on my Android phone. Much better photos for sharing on social sites and through email.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|I really love the whole Alien universe. I really hope they continue with this story line as a reboot to the original movies.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|If you loved the first Sherlock Holmes then you'll love this one as much.  Good acting and excellent production.  Even had some funny scenes too.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Very entertaining and visually inventive.  The third of the three is probably the best of the entire series thus far.  Loads better than the terrible steampunk movie franchise.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Heard alot about the movie so I first rented it and then knew I had to add it to my video collection.
B0081336FO|4.0|Not as good as the first season.  The Hounds of the Baskervilles mystery is particularly laughable and somewhat full of holes.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|Not a bad movie to watch, this was more of a good vs. evil type movie.  As with most Nicholas Cage movies he get's into the drama of the movie.  Overall I would rate a sttrong B+

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I first heard Queensryche on 98 Rock in Baltimore in 1984, Queen of the Reich. They, along with Iron Maiden, were my favorite bands throughout the eighties and early nineties. Unfortunately, Queensryche took a detour with each album after Promised Land. I was always hoping that they would recapture the magic of those first ten years. They finally did with the new album. I was eagerly awaiting the release since the first teases came out a few months ago. I love this album. Every song is good, especially Open Road and A World Without. I have probably listened to the album at least 20 times in my car since I got it, and can't stop streaming it at home. In fact, today in the car, my 8 year old son commented about the album being the only thing I listen to, as he was banging his head. I can't wait to see them near DC some time soon.<br /><br />They are finally a band again and I can't wait to hear and see what the future holds.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|I love Tess of the D'Urbervilles. I've read the book numerous times, and I watch the miniseries with Justine Waddell every couple of years. This version highlights different aspects of the story, and thus it has a very different feel, but it is still very true to the book. I think in many ways it is more accurate and forthright than the other miniseries, while the other excels more with impeccable dramatic pacing and ambiance. I love the casting so much in the other miniseries, I had a hard time seeing Alec and Angel as their characters in this production, but this Tess was phenomenal. I probably won't watch this as often as the other, but I'd still highly recommend it.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|Gandhi said that poverty is the greatest violence. Les Miserables contains the finest music and lyrics ever written for the stage. It is an anthem for the wretched of the earth and all who believe in freedom from dictatorship, religious and ethnic hatred, and exploitation. Read Victor Hugo's book--it has its own music.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|Toca hair salon did not work on my kf so I saw this and I was very happy!! I wouldn't be happier with any other app!!! This is a very good app were you can comb the hair (sometimes is hard to use) blow the hair (which can be crazy sometimes)  cut, shave, grow, and color the hair. When I said the kind of negative things before I ment it as it is not a serious app. It is definitely an app for kids. I would suggest ages 6-10. I almost forgot to mention that you can put on sun glasses and hats! I hope this review was helpful. Btw the ages I suggested were just suggestions.

B008P9M614|5.0|This dvd set is great. it is nothing special, so a Mega-House-fan may not be too happy. But if your alright with every episode on a dvd and nothing more than that, its awesome.
B008JJM88Q|4.0|I got this app when it was the free app of the day, and while it's cool, I would mot have paid $2 for it. If you think &quot;aww, two bucks is nothing&quot; then by all means, get this app. It has won 39 out of 45 games, but that's because I read a ton of things that I throw at it. Here, let me give you some incentive: he guessed Mary Galel, the alien princess on one episode of Doctor Who just like that. Now, if I had done say, that Ratton guy from that Poison Sly two parter in season four, he might not have guessed so easily, but he also got Sarah Jane Smith and, of course, Rory (&lt;3...I'm a Whovian)<br /> Anyway, If two bucks is nothing more than pocket change to you, then I highly recommend this app.<br />Four stars because the music is kind of annoying and it asks you<br />questions you've already answered.<br /><br />Evynlin Diae

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I found it very interesting to see how Christian came to realize what caused him to be the way he was and to realize that he was capable of loving and being loved.

B003SNKBXW|1.0|Read this for my book club. It made for a great meeting because only one person liked it and everyone else kept asking her &#34;why&#34;? (She had a hard time answering.) As they say, &#34;clash&#34; makes for great meetings and we had it on this book in spades.<br /><br />The book has a lot of loose ends and spends too many words on irrelevant information.<br /><br />Was reading this on my Kindle and when I hit 50% I thought that I must have read hundreds of pages because it had taken me so long. Then I find out it's only 371 pages long!!! Couldn't believe it. If I didn't have to read this for book club I would have given up at that point. But no, I kept on. As I said above, I lost hours of my life on this effort that I will never get back.

B00CHILW64|4.0|This films captures the horror of the tsunami by making it a very real and person story of the impact on one family and how the struggle to survive and to find one another.  Naomi Watts was impressive but the young children really had a major impact.

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This is a fairly decent series, and better than a few that I seen in the last couple of years.<br />  It is about Audrey Parker, an FBI Agent, who goes to Haven, Maine where nothing is quite is quite what it seems.  Audrey is on loan to their police department.  She soon meets Duke, an under the table, lower criminal who, like everyone else in town knows more than he appears to, but at the same time he is searching for answers himself.  Audrey also meets Nathan, who works  for the police department and eventually becomes Audrey's partner.  Both men quickly become interested in Audrey.<br />  Audrey finds out that every so often the town becomes plagued with what the residents call the \\" Troubles\\" where a great many of the residents, including Nathan, develop gifts.  The gifts range from the merely benign that only effect the people that have them to the truly horrific and those gifts force the people who have them to leave, become shut-ins, or worse, much worse.<br />  Only Audrey seems to be immune to everyone else's \\" Troubles\\".  Eventually she figures out that she has the ability to help others control their gifts, trigger the gifts themselves, or help the people come to terms with an accept their gifts.  Her very presence in Haven gives many people the hope that the \\" Troubles\\" may someday, soon disappear, but the chief of police, who is also Nathan's father, thinks that this time the \\" Troubles\\" are in Haven to stay.<br />  The series is about how Audrey helps the residents with their gifts as their gifts appear while searching for answers herself, especially after she sees a picture of Lucy, a woman who looks exactly like her and was in Haven about 25 years before and did the same thing that Audrey is doing and after she was finished the \\" Troubles\\" disappeared until recently.  Lucy is in a picture with the \\"Colorado Kid\\".  Audrey is also searching for answers as to who the \\"Colorado Kid\\" was, where she comes from, who she truly is, and why she doesn't remember Lucy.<br />  This Series drew me in and once a person watches a couple of episodes, it turns out to be pretty good.  The plot line is decent.  The characters are decently written, but what does a person expect of characters based on ones written by Stephen King.  All in all this is one is a decent Syfy series and if a person likes a series about a person searching for answers as to who they are while both helping and saving others, then I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this series.

B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I downloaded free angry birds for my kindle fire and all I noticed was full screen ads and when my little bro played it he said that it sucked so Michael, the piggies cheated, and that it was to hard to play. My little brother used harsh words and got THAT angry over angry birds. Once I played it I realized  how bad the game was
B00BT0ZS52|3.0|In my opinion, not very close.<br /><br />But it was good enough (I would give it 6-7/10 for now) that i will watch it again. Some of the stories were stronger than others, but I guess that's the nature of this type of work. Was it worth paying for?  ($15 to buy in HD from AIV) No, not in my opinion. I would pay that to see it on a big screen perhaps. Do I feel ripped off or sucked in? A bit of the latter perhaps, but it was good enough that I do not feel the former. If I see it again and revise my rating I will try to update this review (which in hindsight, isnt really a review at all, but a response to the hype surrounding the film)

B00340ESIS|5.0|Adding one more 5-star rating to the pile.<br />While this book is great for screenwriting, it's great for any writer keen to tell a story.<br />It focuses on what the audience wants (to be entertained, how about that?). Some sections really spoke to me, especially the chapter on movie genres. No, hot 'horror' but 'monster in the house' which goes back to the story of the Minotaur. Through reading this, I worked out I'm writing 'institutional' stories. (A family being an institution.) Love that.<br />If you want to tell stories and entertain people, read this book.
0307730700|5.0|[[ASIN:0307730700 Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown]]  Usually when I write reviews, I like to give a little background, perhaps lay out the contents and then share what you can get out of the book. But in the case of Fearless by Eric Blehm, I'm just going to come to the point and tell you to read the book. Eric Blehm has taken the story of Adam Brown, a team member of Navy Seal Team Six, and painted a picture of what God can do through anyone who will be willing to not quit, to submit their life to God and to trust Him even in difficult times. It tells of humility, sacrifice, selflessness, courage, commitment and honor. It was a fantastic book and I recommend it highly. Now, with all that being said, please allow me to share as if I were writing to Kelley Brown, the widow of the great warrior this book presents.<br />  Kelley, I'm writing as a blogger who recently read the book Fearless written about your husband Adam's life, and thereby yours and your children's lives also. I wanted to write to you personally and share my thoughts after reading this terrific biography. I would tell you how awesome of a person Adam seemed to be, but you already know that. So, I'd like instead to share from my heart a bit of thanksgiving to you and your family for allowing his story to be told and to explain why I felt this way after reading the book.<br />  First, you may still feel grieved and shaken by his death even after coming so far and I pray that the Holy Spirit will be the Comforter that He is to you and your children.. From you seeing Adam through overcoming drug addiction, to standing by him with a blinded eye, nearly severed fingers and other injuries, to watching him love his family and friends and to serve his country and die for that cause, I believe he would say that he wouldn't have made it without you or his other family members being by his side through it all. Thank you for the sacrifices you made toallow Him to fulfill the dreams he had in his heart.<br />  Second, the most important lesson I hope that everyone who reads it and who comes in contact with you sees, and one that I'm reminded of every time I hear another person's testimony, is that God can do amazing things through any of us, no matter how far down we've come, or how far up we think we are. I summed up the title of my review as 'What Can God Do Through You' because I believe Adam's life exemplifies that principle.<br />  I was also moved by the amount of honor shown to Adam in his life of service, his death, burial, and even afterward. I sobbed my way through probably the last 50 pages of the book, not just because of the sacrifices he made, but because of the humility he showed, the honor he was given and the legacy he has left not just for his family, but now for multiplied thousands of people who will hear and learn from his example.<br />  I received this book for free from \\"Water Brook/Multnomah Publishing Group\\" for this review. I was not expecting what I got out of it. I look forward to meeting Adam in eternity some day. I am also thankful to Eric for taking on this project and believe he did a great job telling the story. Anyone else reading this review may read a sneak peak of chapter one at [...]
