B000F7CMRW|5.0|Found this to be a good entertaining suspense thriller.  Also good scenery and effects.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|Aside from the dog, there is nothing in this film worth watching. The special effects are horrible. Why they made the zombies computer-generated instead of just having actors is beyond me, but it looked awful and I felt like I was watching a video game. Will Smith seems like a pretty nice dude in real life and he's okay in this movie but really it's just not gripping at all. The book is actually a million times better and it's nothing like this movie \\"adaptation\\" - the two shouldn't even really have the same title.   The way Hollywood blockbusters are going these days, it seems more likely that I will walk through a completely empty Manhattan than see a good big budget movie.
B000ZN802W|5.0|I knew what the general subject of this film was going in. What I hadn't been prepared for was how much of this young man's emotional journey paralleled that of so many people I've known. You'll also likely to be surprised to see your friends, yourself, in this rebellion.     Of course, the people you've known probably didn't go quite so fatefully far in distancing themselves from all the cluttering \\"stuff\\" of urban society. But surely, we're all acquainted with young people who vanished into their own worlds, at least for a while - leaving their parents to anguish over their whereabouts. And this movie will probably also make a lot of viewers realize how many young people they've known who, like Chris McCandless, silently suffered from, resented, and actually loathed, the essential lack of love between their parents - who rebelled against their parents' fractured, messy marital backgrounds. \\"Into the Wild\\" underscores the often-repeated wisdom that the greatest gift parents can give their children - is not things, and in fact not even first-and-foremost a doting love of those children - but an abiding love for each other.    Clearly though, McCandless cut family ties without being sufficiently prepared to survive in the wilderness. More than his lack of knowledge about hunting for animals and edible plants, he had an unfortunate lack of knowledge about Thoreau, the spiritual mentor whom he was following into solitude. When I myself was once rhapsodizing about Thoreau's philosophy, a friend of mine deflated my admiration slightly by telling me that Walden was actually just a stone's throw away from Thoreau's family house, and that Thoreau's mother came out to his cabin frequently, with meals and cookies she'd baked for him - and probably also to do his laundry. I wanted to shout at the screen to McCandless to heed this seldom-mentioned aspect of Thoreau's retreat into nature. Thoreau was definitely working with a net.    Despite the tragedy though, this movie is truly life-affirming. In contrast with so many movies made now where there is really no one to like - here everyone is a hearteningly decent, likable person. McCandless didn't encounter one sociopathic serial killer on the road - almost unheard of in recent decades. Hal Holbrook does an exceptionally brilliant, touching turn as an older man who briefly serves as a way-station for McCandless. Although Holbrook's role is barely more than a cameo appearance, it's a portrayal that will undoubtedly stick in your memory as one of the most poignant ever captured on film.    The whole movie is brilliantly photographed. Director Sean Penn never allowed any artiness to interfer with the sheer natural beauty of McCandless' journey.
B0012Q94QW|5.0|No doubt about it, I'm a contrarian, and that pattern holds concerning this fictional kids' film.<br /><br />I know that history is askew in this film, yet there are so many pieces that work. Within this fiction, the characterizations, portrayals of prehistoric animals (mammoths, saber-toothed tigers and birds) and cinematography are all dazzling.<br /><br />More importantly, the tale carries several wonderful messages that kids appreciate---the need to protect one's own people as well as others, the need to preserve and restore human rights, and the need to work with others, despite seeming differences. The saga also includes a romance, and legend.<br /><br />And all this comes (as one other reviewer noted) without blood and guts. I wouldn't say the film portrays the world \\"before the White Man came and ruined everything.\\"<br /><br />True enough, the chronology is way off kilter---as the ancient Egyptians reigned long after 10000 B.C. And they undoubtedly did not harness mastodons while building the pyramids. But never mind that.<br /><br />The ancient Egyptians did treat their slaves cruelly.<br /><br />And history aside, this action and adventure film provides authentic representations of prehistoric living conditions, as well as the myths and medicine men of early civilizations. The movie also includes a large dollop of humanism, which sticks with viewers long after the last scene.<br /><br />Our whole family really enjoyed it---much more than we expected, at that.
B000WAEK0E|4.0|What, yet another Van Morrison Greatest Hits assortment? Why do we need this continual barrage? Well, maybe one reason is that everything is remastered but the reason I bought it is that a review in an English music magazine promised some never before released outtakes on disc three. OK, turns out there is just one and that is on disc two. I'd already heard everything else before as I imagine most hardcore Van Morrison fans have, so what this package really amounts to is an excellent compendium for casual fans who think that he faded away in the 1970s.  This three-CD set is filled with undoubtedly great music and the price is very reasonable but like the first reviewer, I can think of many songs that could have been included and some that could easily be omitted. But that brings to mind the point that but for the quality of the remaster, any fan with a fairly comprehensive collection of Van's albums could have slapped this together himself.  Still On Top offers a broad overview of forty years of music, stretching from Morrison's days with Them to albums issued just in the last couple years. Nearly four hours long, it certainly covers a lot of musical territory yet somehow I was left feeling a lack of any real excitement about it.  Despite my slight disappointment, Still On Top: The Greatest Hits will often serve as my Van Morrison fix when I am taking a road trip and can't decide which of his many varied CDs to bring along. And here's an additional thought: Several songs from Moondance are featured here yet the album has never been remastered due reputedly to a dispute between Warner Brothers and Van Morrison. Can this mean a remaster of that classic is imminent? It was not listed in the remastering program included with this set.
B0013FXWVU|5.0|Not having seen the television version of Horton Hears a Who, I can't say whether this is better or not. But it's a perfect rendition on its own, and I found it thoroughly enjoyable---as did a 16-year-old with whom I saw the film yesterday.<br /><br />There are marvelous Seuss-like characters animated on the screen, and their personalities match 100% those of the original two-dimensional Horton, Morton and friends who graced the pages of the good Dr.'s wonderful book.<br /><br />My fondest memories of Horton include his egg-hatching episode. But that in no way diminishes the delight of seeing our old Elephant companion, dancing and prancing his way up a mountain side---through myriad obstacles---to a safe little cave where the Whos and their Whoville can safely reside.<br /><br />Children young and old, including grandparent-variety kids, will love this delightful and colorful tale about sticking to one's highest goals, through thick and thin, and against the advice of all one's friends.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Got much more than I expected  -- there were 2 CD's plus a DVD, when all I expected to receive was one CD.  All were excellent quality.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|A nicely done movie that, a bit to my surprise, kept my three kids (ages 11, 14, 17) all entertained.  I think the reason is that this movie is so plainly different from the current, bubblegum movies they see so often.  Why not five stars, as I'm tempted to give?      First there's the fact that no one seems to smile in the whole film.  Indulge me for a moment while I mention that I find this over-seriousness a recurring problem in Ayn Rand's work.  It's a shame she never learned to lighten up a bit (or to appreciate the merits of well-placed charity, but I digress).        The second problem, which is hardly the fault of the movie, is that the modern style of architecture that seemed so cutting edge at the time has now been done to death -- to the point that the wonderful buildings that are supposed to be driving the story tend to leave the viewer wistful for classicism.         The third problem (WARNING - PLOT SPOILER) is that blowing up a building has a different flavor to it in these post-9/11 days than it did earlier.    These are serious flaws, but perhaps they mostly show how much I enjoyed the movie overall, given that I still rate it between 4 and 5 stars.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I have to agree with most of the other reviews. The episode quality is excellent. The fact that the pilot episode is included is a nice bonus. The only thing lacking is the sound quality on the log lady intros but it can be dealt with.
0307346617|4.0|Unlike many zombie and end of the world novels and movies that gloss over the nitty gritty of what is happening around the world as it goes to hell so they can concentrate on a small group of survivors and off them one by one, World War Z takes a much more comprehensive approach.  By interviewing survivors around the world and getting their personal stories, you get a much broader, more interesting picture of how things got bad, then worse, then started to turn around.  The stylistic approach also allows a interspersing of horror and sadness and comic relief that helps sustain the reader.  You can easily imagine how this could be put together into a really great movie.  The style does begin to drag a bit, however, at times, but since each part is short, the reader is never discouraged from turning the page to see the next bit.  Enjoyable.  Fun.  Scary. Sad.  Best zombie book I can remember.  Donald J. Bingle, Author of Forced Conversion.
0060168366|5.0|Recommended for two types of readers: 1) The person who wants to get an overview of U.S. history in one easy-to-read (but large) volume; and 2) those who, like myself, have read many American biographies and histories.  We can benefit in at least two respects.  First, we get to share a history of our nation as seen from an outsider's perspective.  Second, we learn factual history that somehow never made it into the books we have read, perhaps because we, collectively, were not much interested.<br />  My comment avoids political controversy, so I'll stick with the earlier portion of the book.<br />  First, the beginnings of American slavery were brand new to me, and fascinating.<br />Second -- and as a Philadelphian news to me -- was Johnson's view of the northern colonies/States' support of slavery.  Quakers in Barbados, rich from slave trading, moving to North America! news to me.<br />  Especially appreciated was Johnson's discussion of the \\"thousand years of political traditions, inherited from England,\\" which formed the basis of our Founding Fathers' political actions.<br />  Johnson attributes to Madison's famous \\"We, the people\\" Lincoln's rationale for not permitting States to leave the Union.<br />  And more, much more.  Buy it.  Enjoy it!<br />  One word of warning: read cautiously; Johnson has some blunders, the funniest of which is calling Horatio Gates \\"Horatio Alger.\\"
B00007L4MJ|5.0|From reading the reviews, it is obvious that there is more than one DVD transfer being offered at the same Amazon site. I just finished watching my DVD, the Kino Video 2002 version as advertised, and it was superb. But in reading the 1-star ratings, it is clear that we are not all watching the same version. Comments about blurring and inappropriate music just have to be about some other version.<br />  And by the way, the film itself is of course fabulous.
B000JJSJR8|4.0|I have owned this HD disc for a while and I never grow tire of it!! In many ways, this film is superior to \\"Goodfellows\\" which I also own in HD, not the least being--Sharon Stone!!  Her Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning performance is worth the price of the movie alone!!  A previous reviewer downgraded her performance but I believe this is a personal bias rather an objective one!! Next to her \\"Basic Instinct\\" breakthrough, \\"Casino\\" shows that with a great director, Sharon can deliver the goods as well as any of the great femme actors out there like Charlize & Hillary who I also like.  Dig this in Hi-Def for the gaudiness and the scene where Ginger throws the chips in the air while DeNiro is entranced by her.  Keep in mind though that this is a Universal release and is only available in HD, so do cop a Toshiba machine before they're gone.

0375842381|4.0|It is not often that we get to witness real magic. The opportunity comes only occasionally and when it does it is rarely of the genus that we have witnessed in Phillip Pullman's trilogy, His Dark Materials. The three books take the reader through such a fantastical journey that one ends up praying that the world of the books should somehow become true.    The story deals with the adventures of a care-free and naughty Lyra Belecqua, who lives in another universe that is parallel to our own. It deals with her adventures and travels through various parallel universes in realization of a cosmic destiny which she must fulfill. As is the nature of all great destinies in literature, there are people (and armoured polar bears, and flying witches, and other fantastical beings!) from various universes helping her in fulfilling it. There is the boy, Will Parry, from our own universe who becomes her companion in the epic events, and who is linked to her destiny. Lyra, along with Will, has to fight various forces that try to keep her from fulfilling what she must. What follows is an epic adventure and a coming-of-age story of the two children, ripe with its share of heroes, villains, and others whose loyalties we don't quite know.    The series has been intended not only for young adults but also for grown-ups. There are various themes in the novels, the orthodoxy and dogmatism of organized religion, speculations on the nature of God, the after-life, the universe, etc. that will definitely appeal to a mature mind. The work deals with a broad range of ideas, relating to science, religion, and philosophies of right and wrong.     One of the challenges in writing a trilogy is to maintain the standard of quality and the pace and intrigue in the action.  The writer has managed this with immense skill. Not only does the interest of the reader never wane, but one is more deeply entangled in the plot as the story progresses. Also the development of the characters is worth mentioning. The development of Lyra into a young lady and of Will into a mature young man has received skillful treatment. Also the development of other characters like Pantlaimon and Mrs. Coulter deserve mention. The author's style of writing is simple, yet powerful and convincing.    His Dark Materials, I dare say considering Mr. Harry Potter's immense following, the best work in the genre of children's fantasy that we have witnessed in recent times.

1582701709|4.0|[[ASIN:0977412148 Why Be Normal...your life can be so much better]]<br />If you are looking for something different in your life \\"The Secret\\" can help you get there.  If you have been taught that life sucks and then you die, this book will be very uncomfortable for you.  You probably also believe in luck, and have good reason to do so.  Beliefs like these determine your comfort zone and the results you get in your life.  If you are looking for better results in your life it takes changing your belief system.  The Secret can help you do that, but don't expect it to be comfortable.  Watch the DVD or read the book.  Keep an open mind and try a couple of the smaller things.  Expect to have a good parking spot before going somewhere.  Do it again and again until you no longer believe it is due to luck.  Then try it on other things.  You don't have  to tell anyone you are doing it, and it is free to think anything you want.  The secret to \\"The Secret\\" is in believing.  Give yourself time to believe and you too can get better results in your life.  I've used \\"The Secret\\" to achieve  positive and negative results and have discussed them in  my book: \\"Why Be Normal...your life can be so much better\\".  When we understand how our thoughts shape our future we pay more attention to what we think.  Dare to expand your comfort zone and dare to get better results.  Believe in better possiblities and they will become your reality.  Make a committment to yourself. Read or watch \\"The Secret at least 3 times (with an open mind).  With time you too will believe.

B000HA4WT8|3.0|I bought this video for my teenage son. It was an okay film for teens, but not for adults. The first two Fast and Furious films were better than Tokyo Drift, and had much more action, and stunt driving.    The theme in The Fast And The Furious Toykyo Drift was about an American teen who had problems and was sent to live with his father in Tokyo, Japan. He didn't fit in well and found himself in trouble almost from the start of the film.    I watched the movie with my son, and the only part I found interesting was the \\"drifting\\" part of the movie. The rest was as usual in teen movies...
B0013FBS20|4.0|Video & audio quality is excellent but the best part of the movie is the first hour. I just wish they would of spent a fraction of the time as they did for the scenery on the infected zombies.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Just finished watching, and must say I loved it. Great to see the old gang back in action, would of been nice to see Richard Dean Anderson though. I can't wait for the next movie this summer. Only bad thing I can say is where is the Blu-Ray version?
B000YIGNKE|1.0|I agree with \\"Eileen\\" who has not read the Austen stories, but knows all the films. She gave one star and so do I, only because I was able to watch it through...just.        I , in contrast, have read the stories, and Persuasion is my favourite. Watching this new abridged and adapted version, I had to wonder why MT bothered at all. The feeling of the piece in no way evokes the intimacy of the story. It has a remote tableau-esque objectivity, jarringly punctuated with overwrought carryings on. The hyperventilating panic-attack characterisation of Anne is terribly distracting.   I too recommend the Ciaran Hinds/Amanda Root version, which truly portrays the fine subtlety ,intimate poignancy, and reserved intensity which are so vital to the fabric and feel of Austen's original story.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|I absolutely loved this album and it is on par with James Blunt's first release 'Back To Bedlam'. This British pop sensation is on the road again with 10 songs of pure sensory delight. '1973' has become a radio station hit staple and so has 'Carry You Home'. There is not one single weak song on this quality driven album release. This CD is a release that takes the listener through the steppes of life and death, love and forgiveness, regret and hope.<br />Songs like 'I'll Take Everything' and 'Same Mistake' are haunting masterpieces that are vocalised so powerfully by Blunt. The Piano in Same Mistake makes this song as special as it is. 'Shine On' was one of my favourites for it has a beautiful message that each of us shines in our own special way.<br />This definitely won't be James Blunt's final release, and his soft rock/pop sound has won him acclaim and praise. The last track 'I Can't Hear The Music' is another beautiful soft song with pertinant and heart warming lyrics.<br />Give this album a listen. You'll not be disappointed at all.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Stargate SG-1 got cancelled before all of the story arcs could be concluded, and one of these was the threat of the Ori.  The Ori were (was?) a group of ascended beings who were trying to obtain dominion over everyone who wasn't ascended, and promoted this through a quasi-religion.  \\"Priors\\" would appear on unconverted worlds and advise everyone that they could accept \\"Origin\\" as  the basis for their lives, or face destruction.  They were really good at the destruction part, due to some nifty technology and a seemingly limitless supply of warships.<br /><br />\\"The Ark of Truth\\" concludes this story line.  Without creating spoilers, it's basically an extended SG-1 episode with some great location shots and a hair better visual effects than usual.  It also sets the stage for additional adventures, should the market support more Stargate SG-1 specials like this.<br /><br />Extras on the DVD include some behind-the-scenes featurettes and a clip from a fan convention where the producers and several cast members answer questions in a panel format.  Make sure you catch this, if only to see a hypernerd brand himself for all eternity by insisting that he be allowed to sing an \\"Ode to Stargate\\" composition he wrote, right in front of The Ancients and everybody.  Everyone has their own \\"most embarrassing moment,\\" but this sets a new standard.
0553208845|4.0|I first read SIDDHARTHA over thirty years ago.  The only impression it left upon me at the time was disappointment.  It seemed that Siddhartha really had not achieved much wisdom; he had simply grown old, after a life of mistakes, and finally resigned himself well enough to life's disappointments to be contented with life.  To be sure, that is no mean accomplishment, but quite a few ordinary people manage to achieve it.  Even I have, and I am not all that old yet.  Upon reading it again, I see that Siddhartha  is supposed to have achieved ultimate truth in the end.  I am fairly sure that when Hesse wrote the book, he himself had not yet achieved ultimate truth.  Did he ever?<br /><br />Siddhartha encounters Buddha while still quite young.  He sees that though Buddha has found truth, he is not able to teach it in such a way that his followers do.  So he does not become a disciple, but eventually finds the ultimate truth on his own.  The A true seeker can accept now doctrine, though one who has found the truth accepts all doctrines.  Carried to an extreme, and Siddhartha insists that it must be carried to the extreme, this means that contradictory doctrines are all equally true.  Since time is not real then sorrow and bliss, good and evil, and so on, are illusions.  This strikes unenlightened people like me as foolish - I really cannot acknowledge that Ted Bundy is not evil, nor that there is no difference between Auschwitz and Disneyland  -- but the truth always sounds foolish to the unenlightened.  This certainly makes the pronouncements of the enlightened impossible to criticize.<br /><br />In my unenlightened state, ultimate truth strikes me as pointless and gloomy.  I gather that since we are all eventually supposed to reach NIRVANA, or whatever, and there is no time, then none of mankind's suffering is real.  Well, it sure seems real; if it is not real, what on earth is its point?  I am skeptical when I am told that Buddhist monks are in possession of ultimate truth.  People read Siddhartha and tell me that they find it full of peace and wisdom.  But I will bet that I am not the only one who is left shaking his head.<br /><br />Hesse's prose is quite beautiful.  I imagine when it was written, SIDDHARTHA must have been one of the earliest Western accounts of Eastern philosophy.  It is well worth reading on these accounts.read Siddhartha and tell me that they find it full of peace and wisdom.

It was shipped well, however my only complaint is that one of the plastic hinges broke on the over-sized DVD case and it makes it a bit awkward to open and close.

B000Z8GZYW|4.0|This is one of the funniest films of the Nineties, in my opinion.  Bill Murray perfectly captures a thoroughly dislikable, self-centered jerk whose soul is polished by having to re-live the same day over and over till he gets it right.  In the process, the vignettes of his sometimes clumsy efforts are hysterical.  A wonderful collection of one-liners, too.
0375842209|5.0|Not just for young adults--in fact, this book was released in Europe as an adult title--The Book Thief is a classic-in-the-making. Some have compared it as a cross between Slaughterhouse Five and The Diary of Anne Frank, and it has similarities between both.  Death is the narrator of this novel about a pre-teen girl living in a small town near Munich at the start of World War II. The historical detail is absorbing, as is the girl's coming-of-age story. Death, as a cordial--but not kind--observer, keeps the action not quite so disturbing because, as he says in the beginning, we all die. He foretells the events in The Book Thief, but we know that he will be there to gather each person's soul, as he does for us all.

B00005JLEU|1.0|I bought this movie with the very high hopes of watching an entertaining, artsy, beautiful story packed to the brim with excitement and great characters.  What I got was nothing of the kind.  I watched this with 2 other people, both of whom hated it also, and we've seen a lot of movies.  After 20 minutes of watching it, I remarked that I would give this movie an \\"F\\" at this point.  The other two in the room agreed wholeheartedly.  We kept waiting, watching, and hoping for it to improve in any way, shape, or form.  No such luck.  It actually got worse, because THERE IS NO STORY HERE!  Nothing makes any sense at all.  The characters never come to life in any way that makes any sense, the goal of the heroine never becomes apparent, and you're left waiting for the end.  After one hour of complete and utter misery, we fast-forwarded and were very glad we did, because the ending also makes no sense!  So WHY WATCH IT?  and why do people rave on and on about it?  I think one reviewer has hit the nail on the head: people are only pretending to like it because they think it makes them sound intellectual.  On a scale from one to ten, we rate it a ZERO, but if you could take the scale and actually drop it on the movie, and destroy it, that might be entertaining!
B00104QSOM|4.0|A fascinating film that charters the birth of the oil business in the United States during the turn of the 20th Century.<br /><br />Day-Lewis stars as a self made oil man accompanied by his adopted son who is told about a small town that may well be sitting on a lake of oil.  On journeying there he finds a small rural community living on the edge of existence in a mid west that while is still wild carries much of the innocence and generosity that for us in the West unfortunately has become something of a bygone era.<br /><br />The first suggestion that there may be a conflict of interests comes when Day-Lewis buys up land in the area but one member of the community refuses to sell until he speaks with him personally, something Day-Lewis declines and later lives to regret.  A local religious leader requests that he bless the well when it opens, Day-Lewis a business minded man only declines and so begins a spiraling conflict between business and religion that sets the theme of the film.<br /><br />The town grows and so too does Eli, the young religious leaders congregation.  His fiery sermons grip the community and when an accident occurs at the well causing injury to Day-Lewis's son Eli is not slow in blaming this on the lack of the well being 'blessed' before use.  There is also a conflict between Day-Lewis and the established oil companies that wish to buy out all smaller rivals Day-Lewis included.<br /><br />Day-Lewis ever the lonely man throughout the film meets what he thinks is his long lost brother, someone who feels could share in his success.  The conflict between business and religion grows reaching a climax when Day-Lewis is forced into conversion in order to close a business deal.<br /><br />Day-Lewis does a first rate job in this film.  His acting is superb, his tone and personality carry the viewer back to a bygone era in American history.  The director has clearly gone to some work in capturing a small community that once 'did not even have bread' slowly turn into a thriving 'oil town'  The tone of the film is dark (Even in the brightest light of the desert) and really does capture the sparse surroundings of the mid west.<br /><br />The dramatic conclusion at the end of the film I felt was something of an anti climax.  I actually hoped for something better but I found the dialogue between Eli and Day-Lewis first rate.

Why have they chosen to use almost the exact same stuff as was used in Shawshank Redemption and a number of other films?tone of the film is dark (Even in the brightest light of the desert) and really does capture the sparse surroundings of the mid west.    The dramatic conclusion at the end of the film I felt was something of an anti climax.  I actually hoped for something better but I found the dialogue between Eli and Day-Lewis first rate.  Two men who had formed a grudging alliance over the years while remaining bitterest enemies deep inside.    While Eli is ever the sly sneaky individual, keen to exploit religion and keep an iron grip on his small community.

0743539133|5.0|I love this book.  The reader was very easy to listen to and I really enjoyed every chapter.  The way Goodwin organized the story and the level of detail is great.  The story of Lincoln is one of the best in American history and the way it's told here makes it even better.  Lots of insights into the man, how he thought, how he dealt w/ friend and foe, how he dealt w/ his personal struggles and the nation's stuggles.

0446691437|3.0|Some of the reviews are almost longer than this book!  I chose this book to offer a little encouragement.  In that respect, it delivered.  This is what I categorize as a \\"bathroom book,\\" something to keep on the back of the tank to peruse for a few minutes.  It will get you going (in life), provided you have your own ambition.  The author does make some silly statements along the lines of 'Tolstoy had 13 kids & HE managed to crank out work.'  No credit to Mrs. Tolstoy!
B0013D8LOU|1.0|This is perhaps the worst bastardization of a stage musical ever committed to film.  The hideous truncation of Sondheim's brilliant score is the central flaw, from which the film can't recover.  Another serious liability is the astonishingly bland, one-note performance by Johnny Depp.  That this talented actor was so utterly miscast in this role--only to be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, no less--speaks volumes about what is wrong with Hollywood, circa 2008...and why Hollywood should just stop adapting great stageworks into unfathomably poor film versions.
0790733226|5.0|This was a very intriguing movie!  I thought Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey had great chemistry on screen as Ellie Arroway and Palmer Joss.  Some of their conversations brought age-old debates to the forefront.  I was particularly interested in the disagreement they had on religion and God.  Ellie made the point that as a scientist, she could only believe in what she could see and equate facts with.  Palmer then asked her if she loved her father that had passed away when she was a child, to which she replied yes.  Palmer looks directly at Ellie, and said, \\"prove it\\".  Very thought provoking movie.
B000OPPSX0|4.0|I am typically far more focused on musical performance than recorded sound, with the majority of the music in my collection coming from the early days of stereo; however, in this case I do have serious reservations about the sound. Although these readings of Beethoven's violin sonatas have been highly esteemed by collectors over the years, they suffer from a lopsided balance between the violin and piano. The violin is very much forward in the sound picture, really dominating the piano which appears to have been placed too far away from the microphone and/or with the lid closed too far down. What should be an equal partnership sounds more like violin music with piano accompaniment. This is especially disturbing as you strain to hear Clara Haskil's sensitively nuanced, but muted, playing over the bold strokes of Arthur Grumiaux's violin. The sonatas were recorded between September 1956 and September 1957, although I don't hear much variation in sound among them.
B00005V9IK|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies!!  It is hard to pick which is better the cast, special effects or writing.  The special effects go without saying - superb.  The timing on some of the events like the synchronized takedown of the different cities could not have been done better.  I can't say enough nice things about the cast.  Will Smith was funny at times and yet still the tragic hero.  Randy Quaid was priceless!  Jeff Goldblum was more likeable in this movie than I have ever seen him in the past.  I also thought Robert Loggia and Bill Pullman were well chosen.  While the script was similar to movies done in the past, there was a new spin on it.  I particularly liked the scene when Bill Pullman gave his speech prior to fighting the enemy.  Some borrowed history from a Dylan Thomas' poem was genius.
B00005JPTK|2.0|I Am Legend was without a doubt one of the most over hyped and disapointing movies of 2007. Francis Lawerence shows the same mis direction he showed in 2005's Constaine and the script is strictely by the numbers. The only saving grace in the movie is Will Smith's performance as the last man on earth. As for the hyped alternate ending it's also a let down.
B0012K1ILW|4.0|The first spin through New Amerykah Part One is weird, because none of the songs sound like Honey, or much of Ms. Badu's past material.  No live instruments this go-around, little deeply soulful tracks here, but good music nonetheless.  I appreciate Erykah remembering J Dilla and showing much respect with many of the tracks on this CD either dedicated to him (The Healer, Telephone) or working with people who were close to Dilla (Sa-Ra, Karriem Riggins, Bilal, Madlib).    Personal standouts for me include That Hump, Soldier, The Cell, Master Teacher and Honey.  One thing that kills a few of these tracks for me however is some songs, including Honey, Me, My People and Twinkle have stuff added to the song that seems unnecessary.  Or, if the additions had to be done, I'd rather them be an interlude or postlude.  It's bad because I'd love to add Me to a party mix, but when the last minute or so sounds awful, I've gotta pick something else.  The lone song where the change-up sounds really cool is Master Teacher.    I do like the new sound, but judging from the reaction of many Erykah fans here and elsewhere, I'd love to see Erykah go back to the sound we're accustomed to hearing from her on New Amerykah Part II.  But for fans of hip hop and funk, and for Erykah fans who can get used to something new, this album hits most of the right marks.
B000YENUI6|3.0|This is a serviceable Mafia movie. Apart from the bad guys being Russian, this is standard fare. The performances are believable, if somewhat staid and the story mostly sustains itself. There's really very little that is new apart from a naked Viggo Mortensen fight scene. Otherwise it's not a memorable show.

B000ZN802W|2.0|A film made of rubbish.  Let me sum it up:  *chris* excuse me, \\"Alex\\" embarks on an eye opening enlightened \\"journey\\" to Alaska.  Roll the Eddie Vedder music.  *Chris articulates a profound cliched point* for instance, the dialogue between Chris and Mr Franz:  \\"Mr Franz when you want something in life you gotta reach out and grab it\\".  Really Chris?  So it breaks into more Eddie Vedder music and then he eventually dies.  I love how he thought society was such a bad place with all the LIFE experience he had.  I mean he just graduated college but he knows about the trials and tribulations of what it means to live a life and function in society.  Also, how selfish was he by not calling his parents - ok if not his parents, perhaps his sister, who it was obvious they were pretty close with each other.  Speaking of his sister, she was how old?  15-16?  She was spouting out some pretty advanced vocabulary for someone her age.  This movie tried extremely hard.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Filmmaker Frank Darabont has a real affinity for Stephen King's stories having previously adapted two of the author's non-horror tales ([[ASIN:B0002J4ZWS The Shawshank Redemption (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000HEWEDU The Green Mile (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]) and with his latest film he tackles another King story, The Mist, which comes from [[ASIN:0451168615 Skeleton Crew (Signet)]] collection of short stories. Darabont's film thankfully flies in the face of the two prevailing trends of gruesome torture porn horror films and lame J-horror remakes to deliver old school scares for a truly satisfying horror film.<br /><br />Darabont does an excellent job establishing the characters, the dilemma they all face, and then pitting them against each other. Some critics had problems with the shrill, Bible-thumping character of Mrs. Carmody as being an easy caricature; however, by the end of the film, all of the things she has said come true. As anyone who has read any of Stephen King's fiction or seen one of his adaptations knows, a recurring motif is how the internal squabbling of a large group of people is as much of a threat as the horror that threatens them. King shows how fragile the trappings of society are and how it only takes one thing to trigger its collapse.<br /><br />What is so refreshing about The Mist is how flawed the characters are as represented by David, a movie poster artist and the film's hero. He gets scared and makes mistakes but rises to the occasion when needed. Is he any less of a hero for doing what he does in the film? Darabont raises some fascinating questions about the notion of heroics and this is nicely realized by Thomas Jane's wonderfully layered performance. The filmmaker has created a clever, tension-filled apocalyptic monster movie that has the balls to go out on such a daring sucker-punch of an ending that really ticked off some fans of the original novella. Darabont's film remains true to the spirit and vibe of King's story despite the radical reworking of the ending.<br /><br />The first disc features an audio commentary by writer/director Frank Darabont. He spends the bulk of the track pointing out how he cut costs on this modestly budgeted film and gives credit to the crew members who helped him make it, in particular, the effects people. Darabont goes into the nuts and bolts of filmmaking but the highlight is his explanation/justification of the film's controversial ending. As always, he delivers thoughtful observations and imparts loads of information.<br /><br />Also included are eight deleted scenes with optional commentary by Darabont. One scene provides an interesting bit of insight into Brent's character. There is more of David and Ollie trying to convince the others early on about the outside threat. Also included is more of Mrs. Carmody's religious ramblings.<br /><br />\\"Drew Struzan: An Appreciation of an Artist\\" is a profile of this prolific movie poster artist. He has done some of the most memorable posters of all time, including ones for the Star Wars films, E.T. (1982), Blade Runner (1982), and the Indiana Jones films to name but a few. Darabont points out that the introduction of David working in his studio in the film is a tribute to Struzan.<br /><br />There are three Webisodes hosted by Darabont that provide a behind-the-scenes look at three scenes in the film and show what it looks like on the set juxtaposed with final product. We get to see how they did various practical effects in these scenes.<br /><br />Also included are three trailers.<br /><br />The second disc features a black and white version of the film that Darabont claims, in his introduction to it, is his preferred version because it was intended as an homage to classic horror films of the mid-1960s.<br /><br />\\"When Darkness Came: The Making of The Mist\\" takes a look at the origins of the film. Stephen King sings Darabont's praises and talks about how he trusted the filmmaker with the material. There is plenty of on the set footage where we see the cast and crew in action. None of the major studios wanted to do it but Bob Weinstein gave it the greenlight so long as Darabont agreed to do it cheaply and in very little time. This is an excellent look at how this film came together.<br /><br />\\"Taming the Beast: Shooting Scene 35\\" takes a look at the scene where the mutant bugs and birds invade the supermarket. It's the most action-packed scene in the film and was a challenge to shoot and coordinate because it involved a tricky combination practical and digital effects, lots of extras, and stunts.<br /><br />\\"Monsters Among Us: A Look at the Creature FX\\" examines the designs for the various creatures in the film. He employed effects legend Greg Nicotero and illustrator extraordinaire Bernie Wrightson to design them and make them exotic-looking yet realistic enough so it seemed like they could really exist.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Get this movie, but make sure you get the Firefly series also. What makes this movie great is that the characters and the universe are so rich. You lose a little of that if you see only Serenity, but I can tell they really tried to condense that character development into the movie.

B000W796OM|3.0|I find all of the Harry Potter films to be good family fun, and this film is no different.  It is hardly a masterpiece, and it has nothing new to offer.  It does't even break any ground in any aspect of film making.  What it is good for is entertaining the grand kids, and for that it deserves three stars.

0452287588|2.0|I had very high expectations for this book but when I received it and started reading I found it was VERY! difficult to read. It was difficult in that, after reading about 100 pages I felt there was almost no substance. It just seems to go on and on and on without a point being reached. Maybe its because Im a bit older now but, I like books that come to a point. Get to meat of what you want to say, support it, and be done with it. Dont talk it to death.     I think that is book says something important. I also think it could be summed up faster and supported better and still only be 100+ pages in length.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|When I first heard about this my reaction was to groan. Having seen ROCKY BALBOA I have to admit my fears weren't justified.  This is a very entertaining film that bring the Rocky saga to a satisfactory conclusion -- far better than ROCKY V 16 years earlier. His son is an adult, Adrian has died and become a therapist to Geico cavemen, and Rocky finds himself drawn into another improbable contest.  Still, the formula still works.
B0012RCMH4|4.0|Oh wow man!  When I heard about this collection of Hellhammer coming out I was really excited about it.  I'll admit that I've not heard much of Hellhammer's music.  I'm really only familiar with the ep \\"Apocyliptic Raids.\\"  I had heard some briefly when I was in high school with some stoner buddies of mine.  I've actually read about them more than I had the chance to hear the band thru books and various magazines.         Everyone always had good things to say about Hellhammer.  Countless bands have said that they had been heavily influenced by, to me, this elusive band.  Mayhem, Emperor, and Burzum, aka: Count Grisnacht or Varg Vickernes if you want to get technical.  Those bands that I just mentioned were coming up in the early and mid 90's.  During that time, black metal was the new craze in the heavy metal underground.  The funny thing about Hellhammer though is that they were playing in the style of black metal almost 10 years earlier.  1982, 83' to be exact.  Black metal as a style on the metal family tree was just germinating at this time with Venom's second album titled \\"Black Metal\\" which was released in 1982.  But Venom was more than a black metal band.  They were thrash, speed, death and black metal. (Sorry I'm using the phrase: black metal too much but, what else can you call it?) Hellhammer on the other hand was pretty much the prototype \\"black metal\\" band.  It really blows me away that there was music this fierce and heavy so early into the genre of heavy metal.         The first disc of this 2 cd set is called \\"Satanic Rights.\\"  An incredible recording from the embryonic period of Celtic Frost.  For example: \\"Buried and Forgotten\\" turned into \\"Necromantical Screams\\" on Frost's album \\"To Mega Therion\\" from 1985.  It's a little different in parts but it's definitly there.  Some of the other tracks I thought were cool are \\"Messiah, Maniac, and Crucifixtion.\\"  The latter song is an absolute masterpiece of pure black metal mayhem!  But seriously folks, the whole first cd is really cool.       Cd 2 is a mish mash of various live stuff that sounds like it was recorded on a boombox in someone's basement.  It's far from unlistenable though.  Even if the bass and drums drown out the guitar and singing, this second disc is vital too a metalhead's cd rack.  Just for the historical importance alone.  If you are familiar with black metal it shouldn't bother you.  It's all been remixed anyway so I'm sure it sounds a lot better than it ever did.  The production on the first cd is better but it has that filthy sound which to me is kinda cool.       I would have loved to give this album 5 stars but I couldn't because of it's packaging.  I don't mind that it was a gatefold slipcase, I actually like that but, where are the photos and all that kind of stuff?  I like documentation and sadly this cd has has none save for 2 reproduced cd cards with old Hellhammer artwork.  And then, I open them up and they are just black inside.  They could have put a picture and some text on those 2 cd jackets.       But please, don't let that stop you!  For one thing, the price is great and the musical significance of this band is a cornerstone in the history of extreme music.  I highly recommend \\"Demon Entrails\\" for people who are into real heavy metal
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Stephen King has gotten some really bad adaptions (and you stinkers know exactly who you are ) and some decent ones, tv strangely enough.  This one isn't too bad though I agree with those who say the changed ending ruins the ambiquity of King's original tale. Tom Jane turns in a decent enough performance, interesting CGI. Not a bad one to watch on a Saturday night.

1591841992|5.0|With a densely populated landscape of business books out there, it's nice to see something truly unique. \\"Solving problems and selling ideas with pictures\\", reads the apt subtitle of this napkin-shaped, unassuming book that may finally be what you've been looking for.    Dan Roam has written a fun and frank book about ideating through business ideas using visual methods. Dan focuses on the communication aspect of problem solving, using simple yet surprisingly impactful techniques for expressing ideas in ways that ensure everybody \\"gets it\\".    In the first two parts of The Back of the Napkin, we are re-introduced to elements of drawings, charts and graphs. While elemental, building from a basic foundation of shapes and defining the process of visual thinking allows each of us to see that we can and do think this way, and no, you don't have to draw well to pull it off!    The second part of this book focus on the \\"tools and rules for good visual thinking\\". Experienced visual communicators and newcomers alike will appreciate the lighthearted approach to this topic, while fans of Edward Tufte will surely appreciate some similarities of perspective.    The Back of the Napkin really kicks into high gear in the third and fourth parts, Developing and Selling Ideas. We've all seen a group of professionals get stuck going in circles when presented with a visual style that in no way fits the type of problem being discussed. In Developing Ideas, we see what types of pictures are best for various problem types. In the past, I've used the Periodic Table of Visualization Methods to pick an appropriate model, but like the rest of this book, Dan describes in simple terms how to solve a \\"How Much\\" problem, a \\"Where\\" and \\"Why\\" problem and so on.    The Back of the Napkin shows us that simple drawings, be they on a napkin or a boardroom white board, may very well be the most succinct, efficient and accessible way to solve problems and sell ideas. You'll be solving the right problem, with the right visual tools, with everyone \\"on the same page\\".

An imaginative and original (?) take on necromancy.<br />I've never read a fantasy book wich such onedimensional, uninteresting and bland characters. Do they even have personality? They are dead. Dolls. There's no emotion in this book. You can't care what happens to these characters. Some of the action sequences are somewhat enjoyable but completely trite.<br /><br />Work has been but into creating this fantasy world but it lacks a finishing touch and its possibly imaginative features are never taken advantage of in the execution.<br /><br />Come on people! An interesting take on necromancy and controlling undead with the use of bells doesn't warrant a 5 star review!<br />If you like this kind of cheap, unexplained sense of mystery and continuous action then this is a book for you. On the other hand if you are searching for a fantasy book with memorable and lovable characters, multilayered plot, emotion and atmosphere then stay the **** away!<br /><br />PS. I must mention though, that I read the sequel Lirael, and actually liked that a lot. But that book was on a whole different level than this one.
B000ZN802W|5.0|In terms of sheer heart and genuine performances...movies simply don't get much better (if at all) than this.  some naysayers are chirping a bit on here..but this film's heart will not be denied and it is a masterpiece never the less.  the main character wasn't about to accept the fairly standard societal party line that \\"that's just the way it is\\". that dysfunction (family or other), hypocracy, mindless conformity, and the endless accumulation of wealth and superfluous things are pretty much unavoidable components of modern living.  he was aware of a truth glimmering just below the surface of these human-societal failings, and came to the conclusion that a quest for raw truth would be priority number one. In light of the obvious fact that the world can be a confusing and ambiguous place sometimes...I think it is wrong to cast harsh judgement against the character when it is clear that his quest was not ego driven. he was a deeply troubled man doing what he beleived was the right thing to do. there is a saying that it is a rare person who is sensitive enough to hear the call and strong enough to walk the path.

Obama is dangerous for America when he looks up to a man who says horrible things about America and travels to enemy countries like Libya to meet with Kadafy with Louis Farrakhan.

B000F48CD8|4.0|They can resist the title all they want, but it's hard to think of the Raconteurs as anything other than a supergroup. Sure, Jack White is the only member of the band who qualifies as a true star (a rock star in this day and age. Imagine that!), but Detroit songwriter Brendan Benson isn't exactly an unknown. Okay, maybe you've never heard of him, but it's not all about you, okay? As for the rhythm section of Jack Lawrence (bass) and Patrick Keeler (drums), they're from the Greenhornes, a band that, although not mega-famous by any stretch of the imagination, certainly has its following.     There's also a genuine group dynamic here. White doesn't dominate the sessions, sharing the writing, vocal, guitar, and keyboard credits with Benson. Give Broken Boy Soldiers a good listen, and you'll find that each songwriting partner brings his own distinct ideas and influences to the table- there's plenty of backroom psychedelia, mutant blues, hook-filled 60s pop, wailing garage rock, postmodern boogie, crunchy power chordage, acoustic delirium, menacing surrealism, playful humor, and emotive introspection here, all of it folded neatly into ten fantastically crafted songs. It's an incredibly fun, varied, and at times unpredictable mixture, a miniature guided tour through the imaginary record collections of two of modern rock's finest journeymen.     But having said that, Broken Boy Soldiers isn't a masterpiece, nor is it earth shattering. Of course, it doesn't really try to be. It's above all that \\"historical significance\\" stuff. It's a record that's more interested in having a good time than changing the world, and it doesn't mind one bit the fact that it's incredibly slight. As a matter of fact, that's part of its charm. You can hear it in the opening track. Easily one of the finest singles of this century (remember, it's only 2008, so the designation isn't all that monumental yet), \\"Steady, As She Goes\\" is a relentless surge of menacing indie-pop brilliance, a Love-esque brew of ominous vocals and irresistible melodies. After that, the album jumps gleefully all over the place, nailing schmaltz-free balladry (\\"Together\\"), apocalyptic neo-psych (the title track), broken down prog metal (\\"Store Bought Bones\\"), cryptically bright acoustic pop (\\"Yellow Sun\\"), playful absurdity (\\"Intimate Secretary\\"), and spooky doom-lounge blues (\\"Blue Veins\\") without missing a beat. In the end, it's a difficult album to complain about, and only \\"Call It A Day\\" comes off as genuinely underwhelming. It's not a bad track, just a bit dull.     So, expect anything short of genius, and you'll probably be rewarded. Enjoy!

It rings true, and can be connected to our Judeo-Christian  core values, if that is important to you.  Even if it isn't, thousands of years of wisdom are  concentrated in the author's words,  and useful for finding some calm in this disturbed world.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Moviegoers who liked EVOLUTION, MEN IN BLACK, SPACEBALLS, MARS ATTACKS!, MYSTERY MEN or THE FIFTH ELEMENT will find something to love in GALAXY QUEST, one of my favorite films of the past fifty years.<br /><br />By now we all know the story, so it's hard to recall how difficult it was for most ordinary moviegoers to get their heads around the concept back in the year 2000: \\"They're actors in an old-time, cancelled TV sci-fi show and they get W-H-A-T?\\"  People were walking out of the theater in droves the way that they used to walk out of Antonioni's L'AVVENTURA, unable to take in the  slightest detail due to a mental fog having set into their brains.  You know what numbskulls the US public are, and how nobody ever went broke underestimating them.  Well, writer Dean Parisot somehow made us sit up and pay attention and for once a \\"high concept\\" approach to metafiction paid off in a big way.  Part of it was his concern for establishing the characters, the actors whom we come to love despite their general egotism (Tim Allen), narrow view of life (Sigourney Weaver), distaste for all things American (Alan Rickman), etc.  On top of that, like a celluloid gel, was added our memories of STAR TREK and other cult shows, and on top of that, our generalized knowledge of fan bases--for even if we're not uberfans ourselves, we like to poke fun at those who are.  However in this case, the fans themselves become heroic in a genuinely surprising and resonant way, led by the redoubtable Justin Long (so funny when his mother pressures him to take out the trash, while he's in the middle of saving an entire universe from slavery and collapse).<br /><br />The actors are all uniformly good, except that this time around I was sort of \\"not so great\\" about Sam Rockwell, who seemed to be hamming it up for no reason, though his part (as a bit player on the original show, \\"Crewman #2) was perhaps more shallowly executed than the others and he might have felt he had to make up for it by a trunkload of smirks and gapes.  Oh well, what would there be left to criticize if everything was perfect and everyone else practically was!  Poor Tim Allen, imagine knowing that you had once appeared in a great movie like GALAXY QUEST and now you're making WILD HOGS, though I'm sure he's crying all the way to the bank.<br /><br />And I didn't recognize Keith Mars until that spaceman makeup until the very last reel!gapes.

B0000009SM|5.0|This, in my opinion, is the most cohesive Zappa album made.  It shines like a diamond, all the many facets of the Zappa Universe.  Humor, guitar abuse, difficult time signatures, raucous and sublime vocals, stunning muscianship and general bizarre lyrics make this, still, after all these years, a joy to listen to.    My music teacher, waaay back then, listened to this and she said, \\"it seems like they were having fun with music\\", which I guess she meant to say that it was absolutely free and unconcerned with the current (disco) style-of-the-moment.    Behind all the hair, the sneer, the mustachio / imperial, the intolerance of inept band members, or live performances of his work....Frank was a playful type at heart.  This album showed his full spectrum of colors.    Sorry to say, tho...after this he seemed to move on to juvenile, scatological humor and recordings (Sheik Yerbouti, Thing-Fish, You are What you Is...etc) which bothered me, but I remained a staunch Zappa fan regardless.    Cop this one...its legendary. It ranks as my fav Zappa CD...of course followed by Roxy n Elsewhere, Grand Wazoo, Make a Jazz Noise Here, and of course, Absolutely Free.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|My daughter and I saw this movie at a foreign film night in a local independent house and fell in love with it. We came right home and ordered in on Amazon.<br /><br />It is a sweet story of two musicians who meet on the street and are able to share their lives. In the end he realizes one of his dreams and she has a reconciliation of a broken relationship. The music is an added bonus.<br /><br />We have watched this movie a few times and enjoyed it each time. When it showed up on the Oscars we were surprised.

B0013FFMOK|4.0|Okay, I admit it, knowing this was about Zombies I skipped this in the theaters, but a friend provided his DVD (my copy on the way) to me knowing that I know, Will Smith is an actor that is not only at the peak of his career, but selects his projects consisently well and never disappoints.  I know I can \\"trust\\" Will Smith flicks to be good and entertaining.    I got over my \\"zombie\\" years back in the 70s (Night of the Living Dead), but this story is a well woven masterpiece filling in temporal \\"blanks\\" as you focus on each scene.  By example, many flicks show you \\"results\\" in a scene, but never how it got that way and by example I'm pleased to see them retrospectively show how the bridges got destroyed, which was lingering in my mind since seeing the trailer.  In this fashion many other details are not left out, explained through close observation; and this is important to me in a movie.    Technically well crafted integration of computer graphic animation and \\"analog\\" characters and sets.  Attention to detail and budget apparently were not an issue, and it shows.  The breadth and scope of the film leave you saying, \\"wow, how'd they do all that?\\"    I fully enjoyed Will Smiths character, Robert Neville, and his multifaceted talents as urban outdoorsman, scientist, father, husband and more all rolled up into todays \\"ideal male\\"... compassionate, focused, capable, determined, warrior against evil, survivor, philosophical messenger, altruistic, responsible, technical problem solver yet very human in terms of being emotionally impacted by events and profoundly alone in his quest to \\"make right\\" what went \\"terribly wrong\\" with a bitter sweet ending that well... left me with a tear or two.

B00000I8UJ|5.0|Dexter Gordon recorded Go! in 1962, mere days before departing for an extended stay in Europe.  He is joined on this classic session by Sonny Clark on piano, Butch Warren on bass, and Billy Higgins on drums.  The liner notes state that this was one of Dexter's favorite sessions, a \\"classic\\", as he puts it.  It's easy to see why, as this album cooks from start to finish.  The interplay between the four musicians is fantastic and Dexter sounds simply amazing.  There's no other tenor who sounds like he does.  His tone is simply astonishing in its depth.  The album opens with the Gordon original \\"Cheesecake\\" , a rollicking number that lets both Gordon and Clarke show off their chops.  \\"Second Balcony Jump\\" is bop in the same vein, fresh and fun.  The ballads all stand out here, with Gordon's version of \\"Love for Sale\\" a real treat.  The album closes with a delightful version of \\"Three O'Clock in the Morning\\" where Dexter even throws in a bit of \\"Take Me Out to the Ballgame\\".  The Van Gelder remaster sounds incredible, very clear.  A few days later, Blue Note would usher these same musicians back into the studio, the session producing [[ASIN:B000E1IGBA A Swingin' Affair]].  If you enjoy Go!, I highly encourage you to check out that album as well, which to my mind is a subtle improvement over this session.  That's no knock on Go!, which is an essential addition to any jazz collection.
0679746048|1.0|I don't knwo what all the fuss is about this book. I read it as an assignment and forced myself to finish it despite the overwhelming dullness present in this book. Funny parts? One. Cruelty the author is subject to? being forced to take pills. Maybe this book would be more interesting to a psychology student or such, but to an average reader it's a 160 page essay on mental illness. Boring, overinflated and melodramatic was how this book came through to me.
B0012Q94QW|3.0|I have to admit that I enjoyed \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" enough to want to go and see the next movie these developers put out.  Here we have \\"10,000 B.C.\\", clearly a fantasy epic.  The historical concepts might be the one thing that holds a few people from getting really into the film, so I warn you now, this film is not all that historically accurate.  The movie is made to enjoy the adventure and that is all, so enjoy it!  I'll go over some of the historical discrepancies later.<br /><br />I think this movie was funded to speak to the movie going fans that would see films such as \\"Apocalypto\\" which was a pretty good success.  Not to mention epics in general have been doing fairly well these recent years.  However, I like the way \\"10,000 B.C.\\" handled the language barrier problems.  In \\"Apocalypto\\" we basically had to read most of the movie in subtitles because no one spoke that language.  In \\"10,000 B.C.\\" the main characters all speak English, which obviously isn't what they spoke back then.  However, when they come upon another people the other people speak a different language and we have sub titles.  However, you'll notice that when people from the different areas speak to each other they start in a different language then switch to English.  It appears that the developers didn't want the audience reading the film, so rather than make this minutely accurate they took some artistic license and dealt with the problem that way.  An interesting idea and I think it would work for most moviegoers.<br /><br />Basically we're brought into a very primitive world, I hesitate to call the people \\"cave men\\" like everyone else because they clearly built their own shelters and they don't appear to be nomadic either.  Their culture seems more akin to the Native American's in North America, and we don't call them cave men because they constructed teepees.  The movie delves into topics of prophecy, love, and unity.  I think that's kind of the overall concept behind the film.  Basically you're dealing with people that explain things in very mystical terms.  For example, they have a wise woman, who is also a mystic.  Similar to what you find in Native American culture or even in Old Norse cultures and in many others.  So this isn't a new concept.  Anyway, the people in the tribe we're looking at come across a little girl with blue eyes, Evolet.  The old mother says that her people were destroyed by four legged demons (men on horses).  Anyway, in order to become leader of this tribe you need to slay a mastodon.  So the person who kills the mammoth gets to marry the girl.  As is typical of these kinds of films, she and another boy, D'Leh (Steven Straight) had already fallen in love by the time this happens.  So naturally this boy needs to kill the mammoth if he wants to marry her.<br /><br />Regardless of background story and I don't want to give too much away, the point is they were in love.  The four legged demons that took her family and destroyed her tribe eventually come to this tribe and enslave the people, including the blue eyed girl.  So now the chase is on and a group leaves with D'Leh to go after these people that would steal theirs.  What the tribes were a victim of was the expansion of the Egyptian empire.  That much was clearly obvious when we see the three pyramids in Giza.  The Great Pyramid is currently being constructed and the golden top is already in place!  \\"10,000 B.C.\\" really combines reality and fantasy during this period, but it is loosely plausible they would enslave people that far north.  I don't think it's entirely realistic because there were possibly other nations in between.  It ends up turning into a story that requires people to unite and save more than just the girl.  In their travels they meet other peoples who also had been terrorized by the Egyptian empire and they gather a great many people to storm Egypt.  Along the way D'Leh finds out he is beginning to fulfill this ancient prophecy that would lead to thepeople's freedom.  Typical, I know.  I personally hated the end of this movie because it became horribly clich&eacute; to give one last feeling of \\"tragedy\\" so it can end on some ultra-high note of love as anyone watching this film could easily predict.  Personally, I would've just ended it about ten minutes earlier, and done away with the unnecessary annoyance of appealing to an overly clich&eacute; fan base.<br /><br />I only name Steven Straight above because he's really the only person I've seen in another movie that I recognized.  He was in that movie \\"Covenant\\" that was clearly geared towards the same crowed that enjoyed \\"The Craft\\", only it was geared more towards girls to watch.  Either way, I most commend him on doing this film.  Steven did a superior job in this film than he did in such a silly movie as \\"Covenant.\\"  In fact I didn't even recognize him as the same character until I went and looked him up, that usually means an actor is good at playing a diverse amount of roles.  Let's hope this wasn't a one shot, because it definitely doesn't look like he's falling into being type-casted as the pretty boy role to be a female heart throb.<br /><br />It's clearly a fantasy film for anyone who knows any kind of rudimentary history. Is it possible that mankind and saber tooth tigers and mastodons existed in conjunctions, most certainly?  But did all this take place in 10,000 B.C.  That's loose at best.  While it's pretty well founded that mankind would have hunted the mastodons, the way the dates time out it seems these animals would have been nearly extinct around this time frame.  It's taking place at the end of the Pleistocene era and this is during the end of an ice age so the climate is changing drastically.  As my first proof of fantasy I submit the trek to the south.  The tribes are in the snowy mountains and then all of a sudden they walk into very thick jungle.  I'm serious, snow ends and jungle begins.  The jungle is so thick that the blades of grass are taller than the people.  Normally changes like this don't happen instantaneously like that and the characters even complain that it is hot, yet there is snow a whopping two feet away from them. Usually climate shifts will taper off gradually and the only time you find drastic shifts is in the desert when all of a sudden a flood takes place and water is available to turn the desert into a lush area (and this happens today).  Regardless, even when that happens the grass isn't taller than a man or nearly as thick here.  Anyway, when they're traveling through this lush jungle they are attacked by these giant birds, which I seriously tried to go and look up because it looked like they were using real creatures to add an air of realism.  The closest I found was Phorusrhacos, which seems to be in the right period and existed in the Pleistocene era.  They are described as being ostrich like and predatory... that meets my requirement.  I must say, I do like the fact that these real creatures were being readily used in the film!  The only other creature that they come upon is the Saber Tooth tiger, which also falls into the correct time frame for this era.  I was disappointed that there was actually only one and it didn't kill anything.<br /><br />Now I should point out that the animals are all clearly computer generated.  If anyone remembers the wolves from \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" you'll remember how fake and foolish those looked.  Frankly, these don't look all that much better.  It looks like they upgraded their rendering image because these animals look a bit more realistic, but they are still very obviously out of place against the strikingly realistic scenery!  Again, if anyone remembers \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" it was the landscape scenes that were the most impressive; the same is true for \\"10,000 B.C.\\"  The saving grace in \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" was that the wolves were barely even in the movie; unfortunately in \\"10,000 B.C.\\" the presence of animal is far moreintegral to the movie.  So that definitely worked against the film for my ability to enjoy it.<br /><br />Okay, so everything seems somewhat up to par for being historically reasonable.  Then the Egyptian empire is brought into the fold.  This is where fantasy became overly obvious.  First off the Great Pyramid was still under construction and historically that's the oldest pyramid out of the three in Giza (it's not the oldest in existence!)... the other two smaller pyramids are already fully constructed next to it.  I think a lot of this theory comes into play with a psychic named Edgar Cayce who \\"channeled\\" an ancient spirit who told him the pyramids were constructed after the fall of Atlantis from the remnants of that civilization.  I've read a book based around Cayce's Atlantis concept and if I remember it correctly he has it dated around 100,000 years old.  That date is pretty unequivocally unrealistic if you ask me.  There's no evidence of a super civilization existing that long ago that would have influenced the major religions.  If Cayce had proffered a date like 10,000 B.C. for Atlantis, maybe that would make more logical sense, either way, no one has found Atlantis in the form he spoke of yet.  The closest we have to Plato's Atlantis is that he was possibly talking about the Minoans.  Okay tangent done, most historians date the Great Pyramid to be built by Khufu (or Cheops), with construction ending around 2,560 B.C.  This is drastically different from the 10,000 B.C. date that Cayce \\"channeled\\".  So the Cayce Foundation funded some expedition to date elements from the Great Pyramid, such as wood used in the construction, to find out how old the pyramid was.  This dating came up with a range of 3,090-2,723 B.C. (plus or minus 100 to 400 years).  This was in the lower rim and even in the higher range of 3,809B.C. (plus or minus 160 years) we can see it's nowhere near the date of 10,000 B.C. that Cayce got from his spirit contact.  Either Cayce is wrong or Radiocarbon dating is wrong.  I'll stick with Radiocarbon for now.  Either way that doesn't change the fact that this pyramid was built first in that particular strip.<br /><br />Furthermore during this construction it shows the Egyptians using Mastodon's as work animals to haul the stone.  This may make sense for a 10,000 B.C. time frame, but doesn't for a realistic construction time frame since they would have been extinct by then.  Actually, in terms of climate I would say it doesn't even fit the 10,000 B.C. time frame because a Mastodon was more of an artic animal and not really suited for desert survival.  However, I will admit the use of the mastodon was fairly integral to the story-line so I can see why it was used in the Egyptian scenes.  Egypt appears to have a full branching society at this point, but realistically Sumer would have pre-dated Egypt's rise to power, so we'd have to push all the dates for Sumer back to earlier times if Egypt was doing this in 10,000 B.C.  Naturally I don't think anyone will look at this as being remotely historically accurate, especially given the size of the Egyptian civilization at the time frame this movie is presenting.<br /><br />In another part of the movie it does give a very Stargate styled explanation for all this knowledge.  The movie alludes to the fact that there were once three pharaohs and the one building the great pyramid is the last one alive.  You don't ever really see the pharaoh's face, but you do see him standing next to people and he is far taller than anyone else, practically a giant!  In a discussion between characters it is mentioned that some say they came from the stars, presenting the space alien theory.<br /><br />In the end I thought it was a decent adventure to go on.  I don't regret seeing it, but you really need to take the movie for what it is.  It's an attempt at making an adventure epic that was clearly influenced by something like \\"Apocalypto.\\"  Frankly \\"Apocalypto\\" was a better movie and Iwould surely recommend it over this.  I also think that \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" was a little better than what was made here, but I think it's great to get people's interest sparked in the ancient world.  Granted some people will surely be foolish enough to believe this film is accurate, but you'll get that with anyone.  I've even read a book where the author truly believed that it was Satan that built the pyramids in Giza to make a mock Heaven, because pyramids were originally in Heaven (and presumably still are).  Seriously, people will believe anything you throw at them.he film for my ability to enjoy it.    Okay, so everything seems somewhat up to par for being historically reasonable.

B00000J6AG|5.0|I will admit when I first bought this album, I did not like it. In fact, I hated it and would have attempted to sell it immediately, but I'd only paid five bucks or so for it in the first place so I kept it, figuring I wouldn't get much of a return. Two weeks passed with me glaring at what seemed to be wasted money in my cd rack before I finally decided to give Moby's \\"Play\\" another listen. Boy, am I glad I did.    This cd is something strange and intriguing with tracks that are pure ear candy and I enjoyed every minute of it. It's easy to fall into the \\"skip-a-song\\" trap with an album you've heard many times before, but no matter how often I listen to \\"Play\\" I never seem to get tired of it. My favorite songs are \\"South Side\\" and \\"Porcelain\\" but every track is pretty good. I'm not really a techno/dance fan but this album truly made me more open to hearing similar artists.    Just goes to show that everything deserves a second chance.  :]]
B00000K2UX|5.0|I will be brief: any fans of music of movies of the 80's needs to have this soundtrack.  It's easily my favorite soundtrack of all time.  Track for track, there is something for everyone.  It's a shame that soundtracks aren't made like this anymore.

THIS MOVIE WITH ALL OF THE HYPE WAS LONG AND BORING WITH NOTHING NEW UNLESS YOU LIKE WATCHING TILK WALK ACROSS PLAINS ECT ECT.  ENOUGH SAID I DO NOT RECCOMMEND YOU BY THIS WAIT UNTIL YOU CAN GET A USED ONE IF YOU ARE A SUPER FAN.
B000063DFN|4.0|this is a must have for any Maiden fan.  Iron Maiden was in the slot with Powerslave.  With 'Aces High and 2 Minutes to Midnight' leading the charge and ending with the epic 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner.'  While not their most influential album, that goes to Number of the Beast, this could be their best album.
1400082773|2.0|I felt that the Obama hadn't mastered a unified voice.  The narration veered from lyrical to vernacular to ungrammatical colloquial--and all in the narrator's voice.  Obama didn't identify his own voice and then let characters speak in their voices; his voice shifted in tone and language so much that I felt he evoked an \\"unreliable narrator.\\"  I don't think that was his intention.  As a result, the potentially moving aspects of the book were diminished.
B000244FDW|3.0|I thought it was okay. Just okay. Definitely not my favorite. It is from 1980, and the interior lighting is overly harsh; the exteriors are fine but come as a shock in comparison. Mr Darcy is icy, prideful, aloof--so totally believable--but Elizabeth Garvey as Elizabeth Bennet was lacking as she did not show any charism or anything that would make her stand out to the likes of Mr Darcy. &#34;For my part, I confess I could never see any beauty in her...&#34; And I'm not just meaning physical beauty. No sparkle.<br /><br />Some of the dialog was cut and pasted--having other characters say the words. Usually in adaptations, I don't mind it if it serves flow and continuity, but it seemed to serve no purpose. I love watching all P&P films and though I own this DVD, it's not one I watch over and over.<br /><br />Despise me if you dare😆😉
0452289963|5.0|This Book is everything that is true and helpful in the recovery and discovery of identity and purpose.
0375842209|5.0|This is now in my top 10 favorites. I could not put the book down. Told through the voice of death as he watches a young girl live during the holocaust in Nazi Germany. The story takes you to a level of understanding that moves the soul. Even though the subject of course is sad the story is so tender and loving. There is just no good way to say how wonderful this book is. You just have to read it. I read the library copy and had to buy it. It is the kind of book you read more than once and you share with friends. It does have some language in it...but considering the time and what is happening it has it's place.
0440178002|5.0|What a book. Amazing story. Although the ending, well, I won't spoil it for anyone. I jumped to read Giles Milton's books as a follow up on the subject. It's an amazing historical trip..
1878424505|2.0|I must be getting cynical in my old age, but I just can't accept this as anything more than four bits of common sense advice (like \\"Always Do Your Best\\") couched in a lot of New Age gobblygook. Don't get me wrong -- I **AM** a \\"new thought\\" believer and have a large collection of New Age spirituality and self help books, but this one is all hype and no substance.<br /><br />And sorry, but if the author is the chosen transmitter of ancient Toltec wisom, then I'm a Vestal Virgin. Be sure to buy my book on ancient Eqyptian wisdom (Rule one: Never kill a hippo on the Nile). Just $14.00, as seen on Ophra.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic is a great movie that takes you on a journey through time. It is a fantastic movie and well recognized since it won 11 academy awards and has the box office record. The movie makes you feel like you were on that ship, with all the costume design, the drama and the faithfulness to the actual tragedy where nearly 1500 people died either from drowning or freezing in the water. This movie goes beyond anyone's expectation and put Leonardo Dicaprio's career up on a pedestol and hes been on cloud 9 since then. I highly recommend this movie.
B0000CAXID|3.0|I originally owned this CD but sold it a while ago, i am now about to puchase it again mainly because i want to own all the foos albums and this is the only one i dont have. The main problem with this album is the sound even Dave Grohl said this is pretty much a demo, however the songs are quite catchy its just the sound that lets it down
B000IJ7Q32|3.0|This book is.. boring. Real boring. It's like reading over-and-over 50 page chapters that all have the same punch line conclusion. I'll give Diamond credit for being ridiculously knowledgeable about his subject areas, anthropology, biology, geography, etc. He's so knowledgeable he can go on for 30 pages about Caribou poop in Greenland.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I had the good fortune to listen to the unabridged version of Jane Eyre on CD at about the same time I purchased the DVD, so I feel that I've been able to make an accurate comparison of the two media.  This is a truly wonderful DVD made of a great book. The location is perfect; the actors fit their characters like gloves.  Other reviewers have criticized this version for a variety of minor reasons.  Yes, it does gloss over certain parts of Jane's childhood and her wanderings on the moors.  But the directors and screenwriters manage to hit the highlights and the result is more powerful than a full iteration.  Yes, Bertha is not fat and purple, but her more seductive ways make it easier to realize why Mr. Rochester was enchanted by her.  Probably what was most out of character were the \\"bodice heaving\\" scenes, but these are just symbols of the role reversal that takes place over the course of the book - he lays on her at the time of the original marriage and she lays on him after he is blinded.  This is simply unflawed, in my opinion.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|...you must respect them for being artists who are about the music and not chart success. To go from the hardcore-dance \\"Supernatural\\" to the soft-elegant \\"Seventh Tree\\" shows alot of guts from these two artists. Alot of people are comparing this album to their classic \\"Felt Mountain\\", but I disagree. This album is much more warmer and much more pop, whereas \\"Felt Mountain\\" feels colder and jazzier. All the songs are great, but the highlights of this album are:    *I love Clowns, even though you can barely hear Alison sing the words. I suspect this song is more about the 'feel' and not what the song's actually meaning.      *Little Bird is a light, sunny song about dealing with self-doubt and becoming free like a bird with your life and thoughts. Musically, this song reminds me of the Beatles.    *Eat Yourself is my favorite song from this album, but I must admit...I don't know what this song is about. For me, this song takes me to another place and allows me to dictate the song's meaning based on my own personal experience.       *A & E is the first song from this album and it certainly sets the mood for this album. Beautiful, rushing with emotions, and wildly strange, this song deals with a woman who so missed her love, that she tries to commit suicide only to be rescued.     *Cologne Cerrone Houdini is my second favorite song. Its one of the 'faster' song and its quite sexy but sophisticated in its approach.    I know alot of people are disappointed that Goldfrapp switched their style on them, but this is what being an artist is all about. My suggestion to those who can't understand that is open your mind. Having said that, this is not Goldfrapp best album but this shows the evolution of this risk taking group.
B000003TA4|4.0|The music of the nineties has changed forever... The music, the band, the person or the generation X? Who knows? Now, what we've got here is fabulous, entertaining and exhausting. It takes my breathe away! The sound is incredible, the record nothing but perfect. Krist did a great job on this album, the rest of the band is good but Kurt? Kurt sang perfect. He touches you in the heart with his incredible voice. It seems this album can manipulate you. Me personaly, I would do nothing but buy more copies of this album right now considering I already own one. I regret nothing but it wasn't me on the stage performing Nevermind instead of Kurt Cobain. Bleach has grown up a beautiful thing. You all know the rest. It is called Nirvana.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It makes me sad to discover such a great TV show that was canceled after just one season.  This is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen.  The show does not follow the usual Hollywood formula for story lines, and thus creates a great experience for the viewer.  I only wish they would bring the show back, even though it was made over five years ago.  This show deserves to be on the air.

0143038419|5.0|Clare Boothe Luce, the playwright, wrote a brilliant play called \\"The Women,\\" which was turned into an entertaining movie in 1939.  As Pauline Kael noted, it plays upon or confirms the worst fears of women \\"as howling, clawing beasties.\\"<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert's book \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" seems to have turned many of the female \\"reviewers\\" here into...\\"The Women.\\"<br /><br />Speaking as a middle-aged male - neither a caveman nor an (refuse-to-be) emasculated suburbanman - I found this book simply delightful. Being interested in the psyches of both sexes, I found Gilbert's willingness to bare all the slings and arrows of her contemporary urban status absorbing. She lays before us all the vicissitudes of her emotions, life decisions, and self-discoveries. She ponders matters, makes mistakes, reviews her choices, and tries, as much as a human being is able, to find her path. True, her problems are considerably lesser than those who are truly suffering. However, Gilbert's reality IS a reality, and there's no need to punish her for that. She very deftly takes us into that reality, and as it so happens, her travels allow her (and us) to seek the world well beyond her own. She offers us a highly personal, in-depth look into her own mindset, and (blessedly) refuses to whitewash or make lofty on how that works.<br /><br />Gilbert is an excellent writer, her style immediately accessible, and very easy to take in. Laudably, she gives the meaning of foreign words and phrases (I HATE it when writers assume we know, or make us fetch the dictionary), and uses them effortlessly into the context of her sentences and descriptions. Time after time, I laughed out loud; Gilbert has a wicked sense of humor, and this is important; right after taking herself with utter seriousness, she'll surprise you with an edgy, witty line.<br /><br />As one who does not travel much anymore, I thoroughly enjoyed her excursions into Italy, India and Indonesia. Gilbert does not claim to be an authority on those places; she simply writes about them through her own personal experience (for which she is repeatedly here on amazon severely chastised).<br /><br />Writing about a personal \\"spiritual journey\\" is a tricky business. It is very difficult to parlay into words something so monumental as The Spiritual Meaning Of Life As Defined By Me, without sounding precious and falsely beatific. Gilbert tries as best as she can to avoid this pitfall, and she mostly succeeds; if she cannot get the unenlightened (either by choice or by default) to relate to her evolving spiritual quest, it is by no fault of her own. Finding one's self IS a personal journey, one that can't (arguably) be shared in the same way, because no one has the same consciousness.<br /><br />What is important here, though, is that Gilbert DOES take risks in just letting her heart, soul and guts spill out as she may. Felicities, warts and all.<br /><br />And by a significant portion of the female contingent on here, PUNISHED for doing so. Punished for leaving her comfortable life. Punished for not wanting children. Punished for being needy, emotional and even annoying (which she would admit to). Punished for being honest, even when it might present herself in an unfavorable light. To these women, did Gilbert somehow violate some Puritanically-based moral/societal code? The wrath that Gilbert incited is positively astounding...I laughed almost as much at the transparency of these entertaining reviews as I did in the book itself (but the hundreds of other women who understood Gilbert with warm praise should be duly noted as well).<br /><br />I realize there are a lot of haughty Bluestocking types who consider themselves above the kind of emotional rollercoaster Gilbert admits to, but it's at least better than being brain-dead (and I have a feeling that this state is what Gilbert was dreading...and though she careened about wildly trying to escape being buried alive, she at least gamely fought her way out).<br/><br />On the other side of the coin...Gilbert is a successful, creative and flourishing woman. The kind to provoke envy. And has.<br /><br />To those howling, clawing beasties: get over yourselves.creative and flourishing woman. The kind to provoke envy. And has.     To those howling, clawing beasties: get over yourselves.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I was searching for a quick picker-up between my weekly vacuuming - especially in the kitchen (I'm a messy cook...)  My swiffer sweeper was great pushing around the dirt, but not so good at picking it up.  Let me introduce you to my little friend...<br /><br />The Swivel Sweeper works great on tile and carpet. It takes me about 10 minutes to go through my house, and it always leaves it looks clean and inviting.  It's certainly much easier than lugging out my Dyson and more effective at getting into those hard to reach places.  There's no bags to buy and cleaning out the unit is a breeze.  However, you do need to clean out the brushes every couple of uses.  The battery keeps its charge for 3-4 uses.<br /><br />This is not meant to be your primary vacuum unless you're in s small apartment with wood floors...  Which my daughter lives in, and she absolutely loves her Swivel Sweeper.  Plus, it takes up next to no room in the closet.<br /><br />I have strongly recommended this sweeper to my friends, family and co-workers.  Anything to make life a little easier!!!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I had seen write-ups regarding this show, but I don't have Showtime.  So, I was thrilled to be able to order it here.  And, I was not disappointed!  Love it!  Looking forward to Season 2.
1592400876|5.0|I never thought that I'd ever find myself in a quiet, public room, sitting by the fireside after an afternoon of skiing, surrounded by other hotel guests, and suddenly laughing out loud while I read a book about, of all things, punctuation.  However, despite the seemingly dull topic, I found this short little gem of a book to be wonderfully written and, at times, absolutely hilarious.  Lynne Truss has a sense of humor that would probably enable her to make almost any topic you can think of funny.  In this particular case, if you know the English language and you love to read, you'll find \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" to be truly delightful!

B000ZN802W|4.0|Every human being has been thru a rebellion phase in our lives.  We rebel against our parents, teachers, social norms.  We challenge the authority of any kind with idealism, or simply spite.  Some people in doing so, dye their hair, pierce their tongue, visit ashrams in India, or simply put prolonged time in serving PeaceCorps or other humanitarian organizations.  Young Christopher McCandless, main protagonist of this film and Krakauer's best selling novel relinquishes his earthly possessions, gives away his money, abandones his identity and sets of for a two year track across country.  He survives by tending to odd jobs and living in the wilderness until his fateful decision to head to Alaska.  He meets some amazing people along the way, but rejects them all.  What struck me about the young man is that he adopts the same emotional shallowness that he has tried to escape from his own parents.  In his embrace of nature and wilderness, he ends up finding his final shelter in a deserted bus that ultimatey becomes his grave.  One cannot but notice that young Christopher McCandless at his very end, becomes what he has tried altogether to escape. Wheather or not we have money and comfortable lives, without human tenderness, love and emotional connections, we are simply empty shells.  We all have to find our way to define happiness but in the process we are responsible in not hurting people who deeply care about us simply we are in pursuit of our own longings.
B0000DBJDM|1.0|I was very disappointed. Perhaps it was too trippy and I needed more drugs. I recommend Pulse and David Gilmore's DVD instead. Well worth the increase in price
B000QXDED6|4.0|I will say first and foremost that if you are looking for an absorbing and well told story, as in engrossing plot and tightly woven script, then this is not the movie for you.  `300' plays out more like a videogame than a history lesson.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a romping good time with all the violence and women to make any mans fantasy come true then this is the film for you.  While I can't say that it is as fulfilling as `Gladiator' I can say that it is far more entertaining then recent swords-and-sandals fare like `Alexander' and will at least leave you very much entertained; that is, if you are entertained by blood and body parts.<br /><br />What is important to remember when considering watching `300' is that it is based on the graphic novel written by `Sin City' author Frank Miller.  These novels are graphic in more than the literal sense.  So, like `Sin City', `300' builds off of Millers foundation by adding more blood and more nudity.  Also, beings that this is based off of a graphic novel and not necessarily of off historical documents, some of the authenticity of the account has been altered.  For instance, depictions of superhuman men and gods are rampant throughout.  That isn't to say this is an inaccurate account all the way around, I just want to point out that things are not always painted authentically.<br /><br />The story is that of the battle at Thermopylae where 300 Spartan men fought against the much larger Persian army.  Spartan King Leonidas defies the oracles and engages in battle even after he was commanded not to.  After insulting Persian King Xerxes, Leonidas leads his men against an all out attack from the Persian army, but the mere 300 Spartans prove to be more than up for the challenge.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, `300' plays out like a videogame; a really cool looking and fun videogame, but a videogame at that.  The dialog is a bit cheesy and the acting is really nothing more than some macho men wearing close to nothing screaming at one another.  Gerard Butler looks amazing (he looks as if he could break my neck with his abs), as does his army and they all fight masterfully.  The fight sequences are phenomenally done, intense and gratuitous.  That's really why we're watching in the first place so one can't complain too much.  We were promised some impressive action scenes and we receive them in spades.  Having everything aside from the main actors CGI never hurt the film, which surprised me.  After watching CGI slowly erode films like `I Am Legend' I was half expecting this to be a complete mess with corny special effects and ridiculous enemies, but everything looks and feels real and amazingly detailed.<br /><br />In the end I would recommend `300' to anyone wanting a pure adrenaline rush.  Anyone not offended but gore should check this out.  Like my friend told me after the movie ended; this is one of those `get the guys together and throw back a few beers' type of movie; the type of movie that results in long hours at the gym and maybe a black eye or two.hing screaming at one another.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|I have not had the opportunity to view the entire series, as several of the other reviewers have.  I am viewing the episodes one by one as they unspool on HBO.  Nor have I yet read Mr. McCullough's undoubtedly excellent book.  However, I have studied both John and Abigail Adams for a number of years.  I have read multiple volumes, viewed many different presentations, and have visited both the Adams home and the Untarian church where both John and John Quincy Adams are entombed with their respective spouses.  I have found this series to be an excellent depiction of the lives, contributions and sacrifices of John and Abigail Adams.  It is true that a number of details of their stories are not represented, but I understand that such films must concentrate on dramatic high points and haven't enough time to get it all in there.  I personally have no problem with the cinematography...yes, it is a bit murky, but so were many details of life at that time.  I rather like the score, and feel that both Mr. Giamatti and Ms. Linney gave excellent performances.  These characters so vital to our history were underappreciated in both their time and our own, and I hope that this series will help to bring them some of the consideration they so richly deserve.  I intend to purchase this DVD set when it is released and add it as another version of the lives of this facinating couple.

0805066691|5.0|'Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee' by Dee Brown.<br /><br />A poignant recount of the injustices done to the American Indians.  Detailed and amazing stories of of individuals, both Indian and the Army ordered to expel them from their lands, shine through in this absolutely unparalleled work of history.<br /><br />This book should be required reading in every high school in America.  It is a vivid portrait of many proud peoples grappling with having all that they cared about taken away from them - their land, their pride, their homes, their lives.<br /><br />Read it 10 times.  It will make you wince and question our history.  However, it should also serve to teach us what horrors man is capable of carrying out and recognizing that we must not ever allow this to happen again.<br /><br />It is a beautifully sad, amazingly true tale of many proud peoples and the generational destruction caused by Manifest Destiny.
B000A88EVE|5.0|This one made me happy in so many directions at once. David Bowie is just an intriguing person. I really don't care what he does, I'll watch it. But he rocked this character! The story is very interesting and the whole mood of the thing is tripped out. 70's flicks seem to do that to me so factor that in. I guess this is a scifi but the drama of this man on his mission is the cool part. I thought all the actors did well with their roles. There's even smatterings of erotica thrown in to keep things moving along. Buck Henry is here too, not doing anything funny, which he's famous for, but love seeing him, nonetheless.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|Remember back in 1997 when techno and dance was supposed to be the music of the future? Remember that?<br /><br />Journalists raved, but the public yawned. There were some great techno albums, but relatively few that demanded and rewarded prolonged attention. Many just didn't promise an interesting future--they offered us Hill Valley, circa 2015. Sonic landscapes that were mildly entertaining, but not compelling, with everything bright and precise and utopian--fine for the shiny-shirt club crowd, but unsatisfying for anyone craving complicated emotions and experiences.<br /><br />Well, this album isn't \\"Back to the Future II.\\" It's more like \\"Blade Runner.\\" A dingy distorted place, depressing but fascinating, soulful and real.<br /><br />It's ironic--digital audio perfection is more attainable then ever, but the stuff that sounds best often approximates analog authenticity. The tunes on Untrue snap, crackle and pop as if the DJ left an open mic next to his bowl of Rice Krispies, recorded everything on vinyl, then broadcast it to you over a static-filled radio station. The beats are perfect because they're imperfect, more man than machine. And over--or rather, around and through--them, warped vocals wander in and out like lost souls, ghosts of your exes wailing about desire and longing and betrayal. You can't quite make out everything they're saying, but because of that, you can't forget it, either.<br /><br />It all feels natural and real, but like the best art, what looks effortless is purposeful. Calculated for maximum emotional effect, contrived without seeming so. These haunting tracks describe your world--or at least the way your world feels when you're walking home alone on a desolate city night. It's a grim dystopia of urban decay and existential emptiness, but still far more interesting than anything you'll find when the sun's up. The future's here, and it ain't a happy place, but you won't want to leave.

B000YABYLA|3.0|Sorry folks, but I don't consider this movie to be the kind of work that has reality in play.<br /><br />Yes, Juno is funny and entertaining, but the main character's dialogue is too polished, too witty, and too \\"written down\\" to make the movie anything near believable.<br /><br />Pregnant teenagers can be witty, just not all the time!<br /><br />I write a teen column for a living; it is almost absurd for anyone to believe Juno offers a sincere look at real life.  The issues the young lady has to deal with are SERIOUS, SCARY, and NOT SO POLISHED.<br /><br />Is this a DVD I plan to purchase?  Yes.  Is this a DVD that I think everyone should own?  Absolutely not.  This movie is one of the most overrated movies to come out in a while.<br /><br />It's good, bit it ain't THAT good.<br /><br />See ya next review.

B00000F169|5.0|SciFi cult movie from the 70's. You're either onboard or not. I was onboard. The tacky sets, bad acting, overtly ridiculous or pointless plot flow here and there, the simplistic special effects, evidence of 70's tech dressed up to look futuristic; Loved it all! And a small kicker: one of the background songs is awfully similar to the Halloween theme song and this is a Carpenter flick. Guess he was warmin' up his composin' chops. Seriously, this is great late night fare. Keep your eyes open for the nod to \\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\\".
B00020HEL6|4.0|Renee has an amazing voice. I'm not a jazz fan, so I wont say much about this album, but the covers are really good and Renee has great potential to be the next greatest Jazz singer.    Standout tracks include 'Summertime', 'Midnight at The Oasis' and 'Love That Will Last'.
0143038419|5.0|This is a wonderfully warm and witty narrative that is likely to inspire readers to try something new. In describing her adventures in spontaneity by traveling solo through Italy, India and Indonesia, Elizabeth Gilbert awakens the brave heart in women everywhere who desire to be more of themselves.<br /><br />The author's style is charismatic and entertaining, even if a bit self-indulgent.  We are as drawn into her indulgences as she is, enviously cheering her on from the sidelines.<br /><br />\\"Eat, Love, Pray\\" is essentially about enhancing spiritual nature, specifically the author's spiritual nature.  It does not teach doctrine, yet we are left with a desire to become more authentically ourselves in the reading of it.<br /><br />It is likely that \\"Eat, Love, Pray\\" will be read and enjoyed mostly by women - or possibly by men who want to understand more about how the minds of many women work.  It is an excellent example of great story-telling in a non-fiction format.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|I enjoyed I am Legend a lot.  The plot is very basic.  Dr. Neville is the sole survivor of a medical breakthrough gone horribly awry.  He is left alone, his family and friends dead or worse, with just his dog and some mannequins for company.  What that means is that Dr. Neville (Will Smith) has to carry the story himself and he does so very well.  He displays a wide range of emotion throughout the film, making the viewer laugh and cry and ultimately sympathize with the plight of the last man on earth who just can't help but hope against hope that he can undo what has happened and redeem mankind.    If I had to point out gripes about the movie the two that come to mind  are the CGI Vampire/Zombies and the rushed and too coincidental feel of the latter part of the film.  The film maker relied too heavily on CGI antagonists when human models could have worked so much better.  Towards the end of the movie things just seem to be clicking into place too easily for random incidents and things rush rapidly to conclusion for a movie that has been moving slowly up until now.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|Though extremely well made, \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" is basically one long globe-hopping chase. At least Matt Damon proves he can handle the grueling task with considerable skill. This sequel lacks the narrative depth of its predecessors, yet succeeds as a slick action-thriller. It will be interesting to see the next chapter in the Jason Bourne saga.
B000R7I3LY|2.0|Wow, what a great original album.  Ok, just a little word to the folks at Rhapsody... having a scrawny, pale white dude nodding his head to one of her two fabulous singles does neither them, nor Sara any good.  That being said, Sara gets a start because she's pretty cute and her music is at least tolerable.  wouldn't recommend spending hard-earned money on it though.
1591841992|4.0|Are you looking for more effective communication methods?  Do you need to explain complex ideas to your team or employees?  Dan Roam does a great job of making the use of visuals for communication easy for everybody.  In this book, his structured approach provides frustrated engineers and business people an easy entry into the world of visual thinking.  Best of all, Dan practices what he preaches in the book by a consistent, and effective use of visuals throughout.  If you're in business and need to improve your communication, this is a great start and an easy read.  It's certainly not your typical business book.  If this is the book that gets us started, I can't wait for the intermediate and advanced sequels.
B000CPH9I4|4.0|Initially, I was disappointed with this album. Being a Corrs fan, I was expecting something a little more upbeat and catchy. This album, however, is nothing like any of their other albums. It's not celtic pop - it's irish folk. And even though at first it might seem unfamiliar and disappointing - it grows on you.    The standout tracks here are 'Heart Like A Wheel', 'Peggy Gordon', 'Black is The Color' and 'Dimming of The Day'.    If you want some music on a nice quiet evening - this is the album to play.
B000F8O35U|4.0|I wrestled for the longest time over whether to purchase this DVD, and I'm so glad I did! Also, I'm so glad Amazon STILL had this in stock; and shipped it so speedily!<br />  Although the Disney Version adds a typical \\"Disneyfied Happy Ending\\" to Hans Christian Anderson's original tragic and bittersweet fairy tale, there is absolutely no denying the emotional sweep of the Broadway calibre score by Alan Menchen and the late Howard Ashman; most noteably \\"Part Of Your World\\" and \\"Under The Sea.\\"<br />In addition, the voice cast, featuring Jodi Benson, Pat Carroll, and Christopher Daniel Barnes, is superb! The entire production recalls the glory days of Disney Animation, which reached a superb apex  with \\"SLEEPING BEAUTY\\" 30 Years earlier. Not surprisingly, \\"Little Mermaid\\" ushered in a new wave of Disney animated musicals-- and this at a time when Disney's Feature Animation Dept. was banished to a smaller location off the main lot and considered dead but not officially buried.<br />  \\"Beauty and The Beast\\"  received the \\"Best Picture\\" Oscar nomination, but I think \\"Little Mermaid\\" is the far superior film. The DVD extras, chronicling \\"Little Mermaid's\\" stormy production history, a biography of Hans Christian Anderson and the original fairy tale, and a short animated film of Anderson's  heart-breaking \\"The Little Match Girl\\" make this one of the very BEST titles in Disney's Platinum Edition 2 Disc Series.
B000002UJQ|4.0|Few albums captured the Zeitgeist of the late 1990s and contained such good songwriting and musicianship as Radiohead's 1997 effort OK COMPUTER.<br /><br />The twelve tracks here reflect a feeling that our modern world, far from being a utopia, was increasingly marked by feelings of isolation and general existential crises. Thom Yorke's mumbled singing seems based on a doubt as to whether communication was even possible anymore. \\"Let Down\\" and \\"The Tourist\\" are directed at a world of jet travel, where people can easily get from place to place but it seems everything is moving too fast for our own good. \\"Climbing Up the Walls\\" raises the question of why people living in a secure middle-class environment become serial killers. \\"Airbag\\" and \\"Lucky\\" use the theme of horrific crashes, a reminder that our modern technology can kill us just as much as it can help us. \\"Electioneering\\" suggests that the media can deceive as much as inform. All in all, it's a musical accompaniment to the anti-corporate works of John Cerzan and Naomi Klein that rose to popularity around this time.<br /><br />Thought-provoking lyrics are wedded to artful music. While I have been critical of the idea that Radiohead is producing true innovation in popular music--their music is to this day still based on old Western common-practice tonality--there are a number of touches of weird timbre thanks to avant-garde fan Johnny Greenwood. Colin Greenwood's basslines are much more adventurous than in so much popular music. And the production, while certainly succumbing to the \\"loudness wars\\" problem to a degree, nonetheless gives a decent balance of the various instruments.<br /><br />I first encountered this album in 2003, at which time the general mood that inspired the album still hung in the air. I'm not sure what a listener coming to OK COMPUTER today might think of the album, especially if he is too young to have been exposed to such ideas in the late '90s. Still, it's a important album worth encountering.
B0011NVC9I|2.0|Enough!!!  Can Hollywood get any lazier?  Actors command salaries for voice only when added to Animation?  It's not acting!  And, if I wanted to see such, I would just watch a Video Game in simulation mode!  Beowulf might have been awesome if presented in true physical acting form.     To get the bad taste out of my mouth, I popped in my \\"Excalibur\\" DVD.  Guess what, almost 30 years ago, a great sword epic could be done with Real Actors and non-computer generated special effects.      What's up with today's Hollywood?  Producers, Directors, Actors:  Take a look at your past if you want to see a brighter future!
B000G8NXYG|5.0|You know the story, you know the director the actors. This DVD has great contentary and interviews, would reccommend for the serious collector or getting a better understanding of Japanese cinema and culture back in the day and the way it has influesed western film making and also the other way around. Not to mention great story telling.
B000H305U0|4.0|This is a great album. Justin Timberlake totally shot to absolute stardom with this album and for good reason - It sounds like this album was actually produced for two purposes - making catchy music and selling records. Which is basically what the music industry is about.    Th production is what gives the album it's punch - it's catchy, fun and well  marketed. Definitely one of the breakthrough albums of the decade.

B00104QSOM|5.0|This is a movie that most folks either love or hate.  I loved it.  As Woody Allen would say-- \\"I lerved it.\\"  Heck-- if I had decided the Academy Awards I would have given this movie ALL of the awards (including best foreign underwater animation short) and then RETIRED the darn things.  This film takes the cakes, in my opinion.  Best movie EVER.    But the folks who really, really despised this movie should not get all defensive and think that those of us who lerved it are just pretentious jerks who want to look \\"smart.\\"  I have hunch that the folks who disliked \\"There Will Be Blood\\" just never knew any really scary guys like Plainview.  Probably didn't have a Plainview in the family.  No Plainview as a dad, for example.  I imagine it's possible, these days, to grow up and never have to deal with a guy like Plainview in a real life-or-death (or dishonor) type of situation in the middle of blazing hot stinking desert with no way out.  Today, we hose down Saddam's palace with a machine gun and fix our lipstick.  Hoo-ah.  That's scary but it's not the kind of scary that this film celebrates.  This is movie about the demons of the masculine world.  If you ain't seen any of them, then bless your little heart.  You are very fortunate.  You won't understand anything about Plainview because he's from another planet.  You'll sit there trying to figure out when somebody REAL is going to appear.  You'll just throw up your hands in frustration at this weird caricature of a greedy and hateful man.    So, it's cool.  You didn't grow up around a Plainview.  You didn't live in a time when the Plainviews made a living out of solid rock with their bare hands.  You haven't seen that, and you don't understand it, and that's probably a good thing.  But for the historians out there, this film is pure gold as a record of an American archetype.  Or a \\"wherever\\" archetype.  Wherever you find men turning blood into money.  It's not a cheesy Hollywood story.  It's real.  But, if you haven't experienced it, then don't worry.  It's not part of your reality, and you should fall on your knees and thank God that it isn't.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|This is the first time I have been sufficiently moved to post a review, unfortunately for the wrong reasons. It is bad enough that this film has been portrayed as a live action movie, but after watching the first 5 minutes I understood why they didn't advertise the fact it was animated, the animation is dreadful.    Scenes where the characters were not moving or talking were quite well done, that is the justification of the one star I have awarded. The, direction and framing gave the appearance of an early scooby-doo carton, in-fact I think scooby-doo's attention to scaling and composition is slightly better.     Can animated characters show feeling? Yes, this lot looked embarassed.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is one of those feel good movies that the whole family can watch.  This is the story of two Musically gifted individuals that have a chance encounter then are tore apart.  10 years later, the two are reunited with the son that neither new existed.  All driven by the incredible force of music.  You learn about each of their gifts and how it helps them to survive in a world that does not understand or hear the music that moves them.
0812550706|5.0|I've seen Enders Game on bookstore shelves since it was first published in the late 70's.  I figured it must be good to have stayed in print for so long but I managed to avoid reading it for decades.  I just finished it a couple of days ago.  I could kick myself.  This is a GREAT story on so many levels.  I was particularly impressed by Cards world-knowledge.  The book is stacked with understanding of the human condition, leadership principles, etc.  There are folks who don't grasp this stuff in a lifetime, but I think Card was only 26 when he wrote EG.  Great read.
B00005JPTK|4.0|MY my my. What a bunch of critics! I am suprised that many of you did not like this movie more than you did. I happen to love this movie. Now, would I have like for the film to 'trash' the CGI and use real actors? Yes. Does that happen in today's film making? Rarely. Would I have liked a 3 hour epic like LOTR that would have explained in great detail every little piece of the puzzle? Yes. Does that happen too often in Hollywood movies? Rarely.     Nonetheless the movie was fantastic. I am ecstatic that the movie strayed from the vampiric nightmarish theme that the novel used! Vampires? How 80's is that? \\"BLah blah, I vunt to suck yur blohd!\\" And if you all remember the ending in the book... the vampires waiting outside while Neville is locked up in 'jail' so to speak, and someone brings him a suicide pill to take so he can die so peacfully. YAWN!!!! How retarded would that have been to sit through at a movie theater. I can hear people now walking out, \\" WTF was that? That's it?\\"    This movie brought what all of us movie goers, OK, movie goers like myself anyways, like. Suspense, action, good acting, good story line. I thought how they told the back story was great. I would have like to have seen more scenes of the decline right after the New York bridges were blown up, and some snap shots of the years that followed.     You have to admit though, when you saw the scene where Smith follows his dog into that dark building, you were in suspense! You were on the edge of your seat sucked in to that stressed out moment that Will brought to the silver screen so perfectly. WOW what a scene! I was on the edge of my seat!     When he fell victim to a trap, we were all nervous about what was going to happen. WE ALL KNEW SOMETHING BAD WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, but my goodness, it was still so intense!     I think in this world of remake after remake after remake, where comedy really isnt comedy anymore, it is just a slap stick jackass how many f bombs can I fit into a scene to inspire a vulgar laugh, where CGI rules the screen, where movies that inspired us as kids but now as their story continues they fall so very short of greatness (Star Wars), where every story has a sequel plastered all over it, I think this movie did a wonderful job capturing Will's desperate lonely dreaded tortured life.     I loved it. I cant wait to buy the DVD. And by the way, Trashcanman, you say that 'Will Smith has a penchant for picking terrible, schmaltzy films to star in', are you kidding me? Independence Day (entertaining guy flick about alien invasion, oh yea), Ali (great acting), I robot (great? no. Entertaining? Yes in a guy sort of way. Amuzing considering... someday?), In the Persuit of Happiness (heart strings if your a father, besides, true story), Enemy of the State (awesome guy flick again), Bad Boys (oh yea, another guy flick), Hitch (funny flick to take a date to), Ok I'll give you one, Wild Wild West... YUCK!!!     So to all that were really disappointed with this movie... it could have been worse. Bruce Willis as the leading actor? Haha.

0452289963|1.0|Could not read past the first five pages.  How Tolle attempted to include Jesus in his introduction as though that somehow made his teachings endorsed by His word, was obvious to any Christian who knows the Bible, this was outright slander.  Clear to me this was a New Wave book and this was the beginning of the end of my trust in Oprah's judgement. I'm broken hearted because this women chose to believe a concept that makes her equal to God instead of taking the time to learn what her upbringing tried to tell her; the Bible is where she can find all her answers.  Oprah proclaims to be so openminded yet she took one phrase from the Bible out of context, and neglected to do the research on her reaction, as she so dearly proclaims is neccessary to any endorsement she gives.
0143038583|4.0|This is an excellent book about how the industrialization of food production and distribution ultimately affects us, human beings.    Pollan's approach is to take us from our evolution as hunter/gatherers to where we are today, humans living in cities who are completely removed from the food production process. In order to achieve scaleability in food production, we have had to make sacrifices in our food, most of which we do not even know we have made. This book sheds some light on some of those choices which have been made for us when we choose to outsource food production and distribution to unknown global business conglomerates which we most likely have not heard about, but are nevertheless the main drivers of globalization and US agricultural trade policy.    This book is a real eye-opener, and shows the consequences when we get too far removed from our original agricultural roots.
B00004YZFR|5.0|THE ROLLING STONES in the prime of their of their lives and for the first time Mick Taylor had joined the band WOW!!!! Great music in Madison Square Gardens before the concert in California which was a logistic mess to start with. I would never steer you wrong I am very hard man to please with Rock DVD's Concerts. This is right at the top along with Woodstock, and all the others!!!!
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Absolutely can't get enough of this CD.  I was ready to totally give up on the music scene - then Erykah delivers this insightful and intelligent collection of tracks.  This CD is beyond entertainment.<br /><br />I hadn't listened to Erykah for quite some time.  Then, I happened to catch her live mini-concert on cable a few weeks ago.  I found myself intrigued by something she was doing with the music arrangement for a couple of the songs.  She'd insert an instrumental pause by telling the band to \\"hold-on\\", she'd say some lyrics acapella, then she'd start the beat back up again by telling the band to \\"come on\\".  It was really smooth.  She also has a super-cool, seventies style of dance - sliding one leg out and to the side.  Then dragging it back in again almost like an old-school pimp.  If I had to give that move a name, I would name it the \\"Original Gangsta Lean\\".<br /><br />I bought the CD the first chance I got.  I was a little disappointed that the instrumental pauses used for the concert weren't on the \\"Me\\" track.  I wondered if I'd made a mistake with this purchase.  But, after listening to the entire CD a couple of times, I'm in awe of Erykah and her band's talent.<br /><br />Initially, I liked the \\"My People\\" track the least.  Surprisingly, it has turned out to be the song that now gives me goose-bumps.  The way the different instruments and voices rise and fall throughout the track is powerful and beautiful at the same time.  Simply soul-stirring.  The bass is perfection.  I don't know how anyone with an ounce of rhythm in their body could not love this track.<br /><br />To all you dis-believers - just give it a chance.  Get in a quiet place, perhaps in a meditative stance, pop in this CD, and open your mind to the evidence of Erykah's musical growth.  Next thing you know, you'll be blasting these same tunes in your car while doing the head-bop like a teenager.<br /><br />I hope Erykah doesn't let the negative reactions of a few discourage her from keeping R&B and Neo-Soul honest, political, challenging and truthful.  I hope she doesn't sell-out for kudos from folks who will listen to this CD expecting just more of the same.<br /><br />LOVE THIS CD!!!allenging and truthful.  I hope she doesn't sell-out for kudos from folks who will listen to this CD expecting just more of the same.    LOVE THIS CD!!!

I am a new woman now, happy and looking at life from a different perspective.

B00006L3S3|2.0|The quality of John Lennon's writing really began to slip with Mind Games. The only good songs here are \\"Mind Games\\" & \\"Meat City\\" which bracketed the original album. In between those two songs we are given nothing but filler. Of the filler the only decent songs are \\"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\\", \\"Out the Blue\\", \\"Only People\\" & \\"I Know (I Know)\\". At this point in his career he sorely needed a co-writer, Paul McCartney, perhaps? It's true that Lennon had a lot of things going on in his life at this time but his career needed more attention. Lennon had always been respected as a writer, particularly his lyrics, but it didn't happen here.    In this edition of Mind Games we are treated to three bonus cuts that are home demos. As a songwriter & musician I can appreciate these, barely. As a fan they are a waste of time. There  has got to be better things that a fan could be treated to. The sound quality is excellent. The booklet is okay, we get the lyrics & some crude drawings by Lennon. We also get a few photographs. This was a sad point in Lennon's career which, to be honest, didn't really improve. In some ways he was the most talented Beatle but it doesn't show here.
0452289963|5.0|I have been reading this book with a group of co-workers.  It has been very enlightening to my soul!
0789723107|5.0|This is a great book with good suggestions for anyone involved in Internet sales or development.  Without question, you can find a more technical book out there ~ but they are so dry and boring its hard to stay awake while reading them.  Not with this book.  It is quick and easy to read.  A straight forward easy to understand book.    The title is very accurate

B0010X8NF0|3.0|The Darjeeling Limited is an extremely odd and quirky little film.  The cinematography is beautiful in both location and detail. The Darjeeling Limited itself is quite exotic and colorful, and provides us a unique look at train travel in India.  Additionally, native citizens of India are used throughout the film, which adds weight to the authentic feel. However lovely, though, the plot and character development are things left to be desired.<br /><br />The plot is a rambling stream of consciousness that barely held my interest at the time, and, in retrospect, wasn't that interesting after all.  The character development is thin at best, leaving the audience scratching their proverbial heads as to who these people are, how they are related, and why we should care. (Eventually you get it, but it takes far too long.)  The acting is passable but predictable:  Owen Wilson is a jerk and drives his family nuts, Adrien Brody just looks depressed and brow beaten, and Jason Schwartzman has no depth whatsoever as the youngest, skirt chasing brother.<br /><br />I didn't love it and I didn't hate it.  But nothing about this film made me CARE about it, so I really cannot recommend it.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|after a recommendation by my sister, i downloaded an episode of dexter from itunes. i thought it would be fun to watch hall play a different character than he did in six feet under. what a chameleon!  after one show i couldn't stop downloading the rest of the episodes, one by one, and by the end i had to start deleting in order to unburden my hard drive. when i saw that dexter was going to be run on prime time t.v., i tuned in but some much of it was cut (pun intended) that it wasn't the same.      that is why i ordered the dvd. it is smart, funny, as well as dark and suspenseful. my husband, who prefers educational t.v. watched all of the episodes sometimes two at a sitting, and after the season finale, wanted to watch the next one.  alas, we are waiting with baited breath for season two.    if you like something different and aren't faint at heart this is for you!
0440237688|2.0|I am not a prude or a conservative in my outlook on life.  By most standards I would be considered fairly radical.  That being said, I absolutely cannot understand how this book has won the prizes it has as a \\"Book for Children.\\"  While it is well written and thought provoking, and I consider 95% of it as suitable for kids, the ending may confuse and upset those of more tender years, and the graphic description of a release absolutely will shock and deeply disturb those of a more sensitive mien.  I have still not recovered from reading the latter, and I honestly wish I had never read it.  It will stay with me for a long time, upsetting me in the process, and I would never want that to be the case with any of my children.  Please, parents, do not think this book is a great read for your kids just because a number of \\"experts\\" have chosen to award it the prizes and accolades it has received.  It is, as I have titled this review, GHASTLY, and very disturbing.  In closing, I looked at the author's smiling picture at the back of the book and found myself thinking, \\"What kind of person is this woman to be capable of writing such a descriptive passage of a release?  How could she ever want a child to read such a thing? Is she capable of writing other books that hit in such a darkly disturbing way?\\"  I will never be able to answer that last question because I will never read another book from this woman, whom I believe may have some pretty serious mental health issues, especially as it applies to her true feelings about children.
B0011FXLCC|3.0|This is another departure for Goldfrapp. Felt mountain was in my opinion unlistenable stuff, while Black Cherry and Supernature were on the verge of greatness. Here she takes a step back away from the lectronica of these two albums and produces an album of dreamy songs. It has been described as psychedelic but I am not so sure that does apply. I feared a lot from the reviews but it is not that bad. It is however surprisingly \\"commercial\\" sounding for an artist or band of this type. She will undoubtedly lose a great part of the fans who liked the glammy techno of the last record. One positive point is that she is trying to renew her approach but I am not sure this is the right direction.
B00004TDTO|3.0|After the sad death of Roy Schneider, there was a special screening of this, on Easter Sunday, strangely enough. Shockingly, the cinema was only just half full I would have said. I've only seen Jaws once, and that was many years ago, and my friend and me spent the entire time talking throughout it. And it was shown on TV. Hardly great quality. My mum loves the movie, and she owns the sequels, but I've just never got round to watching it.<br /><br />The print we watched wasn't the greatest quality. It was grainy, and jumpy at times, and one important bit was completely missing (the bit where the shark comes out the water for the meat, and Brody says \\"We'll need a bigger boat.\\") The famous line was kept in, but it completely skipped the shark, so one of the most important scares of the movie wasn't there. Disappointed, slightly, but the rest of the movie was still good.<br /><br />I am not going to go into the plot of Jaws. Duh, it's perfectly obvious. Yes, it was 1975, and it was a Steven Spielberg movie (I haven't seen many, I really need to educate myself), but it hasn't dated that badly. Not as badly as I was expecting. Brody, played by Roy Schneider, was excellent, as was the supporting cast, although I didn't know any of them. It did start off, in my opinion, like a really bad slasher movie, with the two teenagers stripping off, and going skinny dipping, but it did get better.<br /><br />The shots from the shark's view were really creepy. I think that's what made the film for me, as it would have ruined the film more, if the shark had been shown more than it was. There was only a couple of very brief glimpses here and there of the shark, towards the end it was shown more. It's good when horror etc movies do that, cos I do have the impression it ruins it otherwise. Predator for example, is a lot more scarier, than if we'd actually seen the Predator more. The thing with Jaws is it's scarier/creepier what you don't see - I tell you, my imagination was making up some awful images when Hooper was looking at the first girl's remains. Bleurgh.<br /><br />Jaws has held its own, against many other contendors/spoofs over the years, and has proved to be very successful. I wasn't even around (never mind thought of) when it was first released, and I enjoyed it. Jaws will always be loved by generations old and new. It shows with me.oper was looking at the first girl's remains. Bleurgh.    Jaws has held its own, against many other contendors/spoofs over the years, and has proved to be very successful.

1416523359|4.0|Lisey's story is an amazing book. About a widower who used to be married to a best-selling horror author Scott Landon. Finally finding time to clean out the attic and collections of her late husband's work brings back memories of their life together. Although Scott was able to find a incredible and unstopable bond with his wife Lisey in his life, he was also a tortured soul that had many demons. Lisey must deal with consequences of these demons that her husband faced in his life. But, also deal with the mental break-down of one of her sisters, and the death threat of a madman if she does not hand over all Scott's memorabilia.     King brings the love that Lisey and her deceased husband still share even after death, while still making this novel terrifying. With the memories of her husband rehashing in her mind she is able to eventually visit a place that her husband was able to use his special powers to go to when times got tough. Lisey is able to connect deeper with her husband even after his death when she uses his special powers to bring herself to visit the place her husband had once visited so many times, and even had brought her too, Bo'ya Moon. With Scott still living within her, it is not Lisey's story but Scott's.     I was not able to put this book down most of the time. Although not one of Kings all time greats(IT, Dreamcatcher) it is an amazing book that will keep you interested till the very end. Also there is made up language that the Landon family used with eachother that sometimes is hard to understand, but made me personally feel closer to the characters and the struggles they were going through. I would suggest this terrific Stephen King novel to anyone who can withstand a horror book with alot of love tied in.
0743496736|4.0|It took only nineteen minutes to change the lives of an entire town. It took nineteen minutes for Peter Houghton to shoot, killing and maiming both physically and emotionally many at Sterling High. Was it post traumatic stress syndrome that caused the continuously harassed Peter to create this horror one spring day? Or was he even the sole gunner? Was anyone else suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome as well?<br /><br />This story centers on Josie Cormier and her court judge mother, Alex, as well as Peter Houghton and his family. The interactions between the people of these two families, as well as their interactions with significant others in town form an interesting set of circumstances.<br /><br />I enjoyed this plot very much, in spite of that fact that it tended to drag at times. The descriptions of the settings are vivid, and the characters are well-developed. But sometimes there was just a little too much information. Overall, I would recommend this book, especially because of its relevancy to our times.

B0013FDM7E|5.0|I Am Legend is by far, the best movie of 2007.I even questioned myself, with the quality of movies now a days (poor plots, bad acting etc.) if Will Smith could hold down a movie for almost two hours by his self. The answer is yes. The movie kept me capitvated the entire hour and a half of it, I felt like it was timed perfectly, not too short, and not overly long either. This was one of those movies that you could feel, the fear of leaving your home on Christmas day because of a viral threat that is spreading is very scary, not to mention being the only person alive in the world for three years and counting. Will Smith deserves the Oscar for Best Actor, because it was hard not to sympathize with him, he had the eyes of Pacino in this film, you could just see the pain, fear, paranoia, etc. in his face, Just watch the part with his dog in his basement (I wont ruin the movie for those who didnt see it.). The symbolism in the movie is beautifully strewn through the film, most people dont even think enough to understand that in movies the scenes where it's kinda like \\"why did the just show that?\\" is connected to the story, which just makes it that much deeper, I.E. The scene where Will Smith is watching Shrek and he recites the lines of the donkey, which pretty much summed up his whole experience as the last survivor on earth, people who dont think (Americans)would'nt understand why that scene is even in the movie. I think Americans are so stupid and critical that they forgot what the purpose of a movie is, Which is entertainment. Watching this made me remember when movies were fun and exciting, when you could'nt wait to see what happend next, it was'nt anything like these hour long crap movies that hollywood bangs out so quickly. If you;re closed minded  you will most likely not like this movie, if you the opposite hey, you might like it. I dont own a blu ray player, but I imagine this movie is super sharp when played on one, with a speaker system. Buy It and if you dontlike it, sell it. Hope my opinion was of some help.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Intimacy, poignancy, memories, melancholy, and loss are represented in this 1999 CD, the first by Dido, now a British music icon. This work represents the epitome of success (to me) because every song is a winner.

B000K4X5XA|2.0|The blu-ray version of \\"Superman: The Movie\\" leaves out one of the most important features of the DVD version: the original stereo sound mix.  In order to make a 5.1 mix for the DVD release, the studio had to re-create the sound effects for the entire movie.  Unfortunately, they did a terrible job.  Everything sounds over done, like in the THX/The Audience Is Listening short.  Imagine if they \\"re did\\" the sound effects for Star Wars? That would be stupid right?  At least give us the option to have a stereo mix.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|This is quite different from what I typically listen to but Eddie Vedder deserves high praise for his originality and solid commitment to capturing the life of Chris McCandless. Richly expressive, the songs speak of inner feelings we seldom share outside of our inner voice; insecurity, contribution, and hope. Vedder's voice is real and he sings with feeling. In places it's haunting. My sister Helen gave me this CD for my birthday and I can't stop listening to it.

B0011NVC98|1.0|This was the *worst* film I was exposed to in 2007.    I would give it minus-stars if I could.    I went to see a different movie, about 8 minutes into the show, I was so turned off, insulted, offended, and angry.    1) They did not make the previews clear that the film was animated.  2) Said animation is similar to \\"Everquest\\" the roleplaying game.  3) Who would want to pay good money to observe someone else's video game?  4) Grendel was soooo unrealistic. Was he supposed to be zombie-ish?  5) The sexual innuendo between drunken Hrothgar and poor queen: gross.  6) Said drunken lechery was out of step with the original saga.  7) The story line was botched from the outset - ruining \\"Beowulf\\".  8) No sympathy for such fake characters was possible.    Burn it to save someone the experience, and read the real saga in english. It's a great, heroic story that deserves better treatment.    Live actors, proper special effects, and script writers / storyboarders who actually *can* read the original would help.     An insult of the first degree to Norse and Anglo-Saxon lore.
B0011FDVKE|5.0|I'll start off this review by saying that I'm a longtime fan of Tift's music, ever since her 2002 debut \\"Bramble Rose.\\" It was obvious from that album that she had an amazing gift in her voice--a beautiful, expressive, and natural instrument, reminiscent of great singers like Emmylou Harris, Dusty Springfield, and Lucinda Williams; and, while occasionally musically derivative, she showed great capability and even greater potential as a songwriter. Her next album, 2004's \\"Tambourine\\" found Tift broadening her horizons as a musician. In addition to the breezy country rock of her first album, she dabbled in 60's soul, Springsteen-esque electric rock, and even gospel music.    As much as I enjoyed her first two albums, there was always something slightly superficial and forced about them. I always got the feeling that Merritt was out more to impress critics than to really make the kind of music that reaches out and connects with people. Now, maybe that's a bit harsh, but one thing is certain--\\"Another Country\\" is anything but superficial and forced. Tift floats gently from genre to genre, usually ending up somewhere in the middle with a sound you can't quite put your finger on. Additionally, at a lean eleven, this is probably her strongest set of songs yet. Hidden behind such mundane titles as \\"Broken,\\" \\"I Know What I'm Looking For Now,\\" \\"Tell Me Something True,\\" and \\"Keep You Happy\\" are songs that are beautiful and tender, natural and understated. Producer George Drakoulis gives the record a warm, lush sound, with a variety of instruments creating a tapestry of sound that frames but never overpowers Tift's gorgeous voice. Speaking of Tift's voice, it sounds better here than it ever has. Her voice sounds older, slightly worn, yet at the same time she has never sounded more confident in her abilities as a vocalist. One listen to the Joni Mitchell-esque \\"Keep You Happy\\" and you can hear how far Tift has come since \\"Bramble Rose.\\"    \\"Another Country\\" finds Tift coming into her own as both a songwriter and a vocalist, graduating from \\"artist to watch\\" to \\"artist to actually listen to.\\"

B000J10EQU|3.0|I have to rate the film a \\"3\\" for the excellent effects, the true-to Superman heroics, and the smoothness of the storyflow.    What I HATE, is that he has been demeaned into an average Joe, because we see his son by Lois is illegitimate. I know that is \\"normal\\" morality in 2008, but it is still offensive to some of us.     Superman always had high ethics, and consideration for Lois, as well as all of humanity - but in this era, he would sleep with her, get her pregnant, and not marry her? What happened to the sense of responsibility and the x-ray-eyes?? I couldn't believe he would not have known before flying off to Krypton.     Is that how his foster mom and daddy Jor-El would have raised him?    Worse, the 5 y/o boy is sickly, a little diva of asthma medicine, health drinks, and overprotective mothering - though he does once show super strength as he is having an asthma attack! This just seemed \\"wrong\\". Why wouldn't Superman and an ordinary, healthy woman, have a healthy, half human, stable child? What are the writers trying to tell us?    That line \\"truth, justice, and the American way\\" got changed. It is now \\"and all that stuff.\\" Doesn't he support traditional American values anymore?    This also degrades the original Superman. The point is that he embodies all those values we wish we had,in one \\"super-man\\". He SHOULD be idealized. He should NOT be \\"politically correct\\" and like average guys with lots of personal faults. HEROES are different.    Another twist: his mortality got emphasized. A blade of broken Kryptonite got inside him...The film was very dramatic. Luthor was more cruel than in previous films. I would not let young kids see Superman beaten and bloody, about to die in the ocean. It's not family-friendly OR inspirational to have the hero brutalized this much.    We did see the Man of Steel rally to save us from Luthor's plan, at even greater peril to his life, despite the pain of losing Lois to a regular man. Is he feeling suicidal in this movie?I was very uncomfortable with his continued affections towards Lois. It was as if he wanted to lure her away. Like he wanted her to cheat on her husband. This is not how a hero should act. Superman is supposed to be \\"above\\" regular humanity, remember? Setting a good example, making us admire him.    So, a toss-up. I'm glad I didn't buy it, and I was sad to see Superman not be so super anymore. The filming was technically sophisticated, and the effects were very good.

B000BJ7BCK|5.0|A good, all-around family film. There is no swearing, nudity, making-out, gross body humor, or sexual innuendo - not even drunken idiot scenes!     Still interested?    The hero is late getting his superpowers, so has to deal with common teen fears of being inadequate as a person, failing his parents, embarrassment over his lack of \\"talent\\", and shyness with pretty girls. The issue of trust between child and parents comes up, as does loyalty among friends despite peer pressure.     After all, being a freshman is bad enough, but a child of famous superheroes hanging with Sidekicks, is just unheard of.     The evil genius turns out to be a girl ... a nice twist to the story.    The arch rival is Warren Peace, son of a hero and an arch-villain. You see the humor here. Actually he is a *very* attractive young man, who plays a complex character well. Check out his genuine smile on the extra features of the disc - he is definitely \\"top model\\" material.    The story has a good pace, interesting characters, and unlike made-for-adult superheroes like Ultraviolet, the Punisher, and Hellboy, these characters are not about revenge/pain/killing/seducing.     They are what traditional superheroes should be - giving us entertainment with a clear line between Good versus Evil. They show us the virtues we admire ... justice, honor, loyalty, courage, fair play, mercy, super strength, extreme intelligence, etc.    Safe for all ages. Maybe intense for kindergarten or younger. Warren Peace, Royal Pain, and the principal can be scary.

B0010358CQ|3.0|We get a decent story, but what the heck happened to the characters? First off, the voice actors have been changed for a number of characters. This is more an issue with the dub, but the sub also has some key characters with changed voices. To add to this we have characters with complete personality changes and even major appearance changes. While we never got a real good look at Briareos before he became a cyborg in the last movie, we got enough of a look to know that how he is represented in this movie looks completely different.<br /><br />This movie is also too dependent on cheesy and flashy action sequences. Heck, the movie opens with an action sequence and once that ends and we move on to the next scene we're pretty much thrown in to yet another completely separate action sequence. We understand that these guys know what they're good at, but developing the story would be kinda nice.<br /><br />Once the story gets going it isn't that bad, although weaker than the previous movie in my opinion. It seems to exist simply as a means of find excuse after excuse to show action scenes rather than existing to tell a good story.<br /><br />The animation itself, and the appearance of the characters especially, is far better in this version than the previous one. The action scenes, while over the top and a bit tiring, are still great to watch and are really what makes the movie worth watching. This movie is like \\"Advent Children\\" in that it seems to exist simply to show a lot of action and flash. The main difference is that the action in this one is worth sitting through the faults for.<br /><br />The voice acting, despite being different, isn't that bad. I feel they should have kept the actors the same for the sequel, but you get used to them for the most part. The music is pretty standard and not quite up to the level of the last one, but still decent enough, especially considering it wasn't that notable in the first film.<br /><br />All in all it's great for action, but when it comes to the story and how it performs as a sequel, it was honestly a disappointment. If you like Appleseed it's worth viewing, but I wouldn't set your expectations to high if you're expecting anything other than a lot of flash and little substance.erforms as a sequel, it was honestly a disappointment.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|First and foremost, the buzz created by Cloverfield is well deserved. There will be people who dislike the acting, cliffhangers, or even the filming techniques. What can't be denied, however, is the epic nature of this movie, and the way in which the viewer is drawn into the chaos.<br /><br />Cloverfield starts off with the beginnings of a surprise party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David). Everyone is getting together in his swanky Manhattan loft to see him on his way to a new career opportunity in Japan. His friend Lily (Jessica Lucas) and his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) are playing hosts, and it is a joyous event throughout. Then Rob's love interest Beth (Odette Yustman) shows up with a date.<br /><br />The party continues on, but it's clear that Rob is not himself. It's evident because the film's humor source, Hud (TJ Miller), is filming every detail of every guest, and happens to catch a fight between Rob and Beth. Aside from that, Hud keeps gravitating towards Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), a girl in which he's extremely interested. They have evidently met several times before, but Marlena doesn't remember Hud, and definitely doesn't want anything to do with his company or the camera.<br /><br />And then all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Manhattan shakes. The ground rumbles, and the tremors are palpable throughout the city. Lights go off, screams ring through the air, and it's too close not to remember the events of 9/11. The residents are frightened out of their minds. Despite initial reports of an earthquake, in no time at all, we learn that not only are the massive sounds and tremors not earthquakes, but instead they are the ear-splitting footsteps of some gigantic monster attacking the city, destroying everything in its path.<br /><br />The party-goers dash for the street, where they see fireballs, massive chunks of buildings being ripped from hinges, and the Statue of Liberty's head come flying down the street like the view from pins at giant's bowling alley.<br /><br />An epic battle ensues in which the group goes into the heart of the battle, as Rob, Lily, Hud, and Marlena go to find Beth, who left for her apartment after the fight. They brave the unknown, monsters that are beyond imagination, and darkness through which nothing but fear can be felt. Drawing perfectly upon fear of the unknown and the loss of sense and perception, the group makes and incredibly dangerous and scary decision to travel through the shutdown, blacked-out subway tunnels. As they're making their way through the city, they are caught in the middle of heavy fire; the military has brought countless troops, artillery, rocket launchers, and jets to saturate the monster's surroundings with bombs. It becomes clear in no time that the military is losing the battle.<br /><br />The true genius of this movie is in its concept from beginning to end. The buzz leads to the anticipation; the usage of a handheld camera for the entire movie's filming style leads to the realistic chaos. In fact, the shaky, spastic, sometimes confusing camera shots are perhaps the movie's strength and weakness at the same time. While lending towards credibility, it leaves the audience wanting to see more, changing a point of view for the hopes of a split second's more viewing time. I wanted to scream a Hud - despite his diligence - to focus a bit more on the action, to ignore the fear for even a split second so I could see the monster and the destruction. The panic and fear are both understandable and realistic.<br /><br />The ending leads to a desire for more. The viewer is left wanting, needing to find a more complete resolution. When I watched it at the theatre, perhaps 50 people waited through the entire list of credits for a hope of an extra scene, maybe a hint about the actual ending, even the slightest bit more information. Don't be fooled into thinking this is just another monster movie, or a cheesy Godzilla movie shot through a handheld camera. It's incredibly intense andprovides shock, suspense, fear, and surprise around every corner. It's wonderfully mysterious, completely original, and sets a new standard for the horror movie genre.ry corner.

B0012Q94QW|2.0|About the best thing that can be said for \\"10,000 B.C.\\" is that it at least doesn't have the human characters sharing screen time with a bunch of rampaging dinosaurs (which puts it light years ahead of \\"One Million Years B.C.\\" in terms of historical realism, though that's not exactly a very high bar for any film to get over). But that's about the only anachronism that doesn't find its way into this film, which seems otherwise designed to give any serious anthropologist or historian a severe case of the professional heebie-jeebies. For here is a movie in which people live in thatch-roofed villages, travel on elaborately designed wooden sailboats, and worship at massive pyramids and temples, thousands of years before any of those things actually existed. Of course, one doesn't expect to find the stark documentary realism of a \\"Quest For Fire\\" in any project by Roland Emmerich - the purveyor of such high class pop culture schlock as \\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Godzilla,\\" \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" etc. - but couldn't somebody have done at least a modicum of historical research before sending this out to a public as woefully uninformed about ancient history as polls seem to indicate this one is?<br /><br />\\"10,000 B.C.\\" actually starts off promisingly, with a fairly exciting chase scene involving a bunch of underdressed homo sapiens pursuing a herd of overdressed woolly mammoths. Then, regrettably, the plot itself takes over, the umpteenth version of that oldie about the evildoers who come from over the mountains to ransack the peace-loving tribe's village and make off with some of their members. It is then up to the hunkiest guy in the group to mount a rescue attempt, braving threats both manmade and natural on the way to his goal.<br /><br />Because we have so little to engage our interest either intellectually or emotionally, our minds are free to ponder some of the truly profound questions of the ages such as how such primitive people, living out in the harshest elements imaginable, still manage to have their eyebrows neatly tweezed and their hands softly manicured at all times.<br /><br />There's not much point in discussing the dialogue or the acting - both largely irrelevant in a film of this type anyway - but it should be pointed out that while the mammoths are really quite impressive in their movements and appearance, the giant dodo birds and saber-toothed tigers with which our heroes also have to contend feel much more like the CGI effects that they clearly are.<br /><br />Who knows, but \\"10,000 B.C.\\" may one day achieve the status of a camp classic - yet, the way I see it, there's nothing quite like a scantily-clad Raquel Welch being chased by an angry Tyrannosaurus Rex to up a movie's chances at achieving cinematic immortality.manage to have their eyebrows neatly tweezed and their hands softly manicured at all times.

159562015X|2.0|The book is a quick read and very helpful in getting one to think about one's strengths and the potential complementary strengths to look for in others to offset one's weaker areas, if you work in a team environment.  However, once I completed the online test and obtained the resultant reports, I was shocked to learn that I would only get the Top 5 Themes, and the other 29 remain a mystery.  Upon contacting the company, I learned that for an additional $550.00 I could then obtain the other 29 themes, as well as their order of ranking.  It is obvious to me that this book is being used as a sales \\"hook\\" to try to get you to spend more money with the company and may also be being used as a \\"beachhead\\" sales device to penetrate into potential corporate accounts.  I was not surprised or enlightened at all by the results, as I have been through a number of these types of profiling and behavioral characteristics tests over the years.  However, they were \\"somewhat\\" useful to reconfirm some of my prior findings as still being current as of today.  I would recommend the book and online test if you have never been through something like this before.  They are quick and very easy to use.  Just be aware that the top 5 themes are only a glimpse of your total \\"being\\" and the other 29 are just as important to your knowledge about yourself. However, unless you are willing to cough up another $550.00, you may end up disappointed and still a bit \\"in-the-dark\\" about your overall strengths.  Good luck.

0876852630|4.0|The temptation when reading any of Bukowski's stuff is to look for heavy-duty meaning in it.  So the advertizing blurb for the screen version of Factotum, for example, describes the film as \\"the story of a man living on the edge, of a writer who is willing to risk everything to make sure that his life is his poetry\\" (Ah, Hollywood!).*  Or a reader disenchanted with the ratrace might see the novel as an indictment of cultural alienation.  And then there's the old standby:  Bukowski's novels are absurdist dramas that underscore the deep meaninglessness of life.<br /><br />All of these are interesting and maybe even (for all I know) valuable interpretations.  But it's pretty clear that Bukowski isn't concerned about such things.  He wants to provide worded snapshots that give viewers glimpses into his life.  The anti-hero of this novel (as of his other novels), Henry Chinaski, roams from job to job with the same lack of direction and abruptness that pre-fame Bukowski (except for his ten-year stint in the post office) did, all the time (again, like Bukowski) belting down too much rotgut wine, freeloading on too many women, and furiously writing between benders and hangovers.<br /><br />The value of Bukowski's snapshots is their incredible, sometimes off-putting honesty.  There's absolutely no romanticization in his depiction of Henry's picaresque anti-adventures.  Within just a few pages, you can unpleasantly smell the sourness of Henry's grimy boarding rooms and his cheap booze.  Bukowski gives us nothing about him to admire, or even to pity.  He simply is who he is, and Bukowski seems to want us to take him as such.  At times Bukowski suggests disdain for the bosses who fire Henry, or the poor 9-to-5 stiffs who live most of their adult lives at jobs they hate.  But when it comes to writing about Henry, Bukowski gives nothing away, neither approval or disapproval.  And this makes Henry, for all his distastefulness, utterly, uncomfortably, real.<br /><br />When you think about it, this is a lot better than some deep philosophical message.  Philosophical messages are a dime-a-dozen.  Fiction with the immediate clarity of a photo album is rare.<br />________<br />* This despite Bukowski's repeated repudiation of the starving artist myth.lot better than some deep philosophical message.

B000ZN802W|5.0|Into the wild is the final outcome, an undeserved consequence of an abnormal state of things - around the not so common disagreements of a couple - produced in the core of the sensitive soul, that decided to seek refugee in the books of Jack London, Tolstoi and Thoreau to build his own reason to live. (You mat realize a certain resemblance respect Truffaut's 400 blows)<br /><br />This long expected project nestled over the years and finally materialized once he made the grade. He - like a modern Robinson Crusoe - will make his personal and circular process of growing up ( four well defined stages; childhood, adolescence, manhood and wisdom) through miles and miles of untamed territory, arresting landscapes to crown his most beloved dream: Alaska. Based on true events, this film slow and progressively involves us around every stage of this urban Odyssey until that tragic finale.<br /><br />Sean Penn undertook this project making use of these infinite landscapes, thinking about the promise of the New World  (Antonin Dvorak) and so many myths of personal bliss that nestle unconsciously in closed rooms of our souls. On the way, he will find vestiges of four previous generations, the hippie couple whose main problem is to have lost a son; an ironic mirror image about Alexander Supertramp wants precisely to avoid and even remember; the last encounter with Franz (superbly performed by Hal Hallbrook) was if I may the supreme moment of this poignant movie.<br /><br />One of the best American registers of the last year.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|\\"Bringing up Baby\\" is a very famous screwball comedy which was a box office failure on its release but has become a cult classic. Starring Katharine Hepburn in her first outright comedy, she is at the heart of why the film failed in 1938. In simple terms, there was just too much of her. Whilst spirited and entertaining, she is also irritating and ruthless and it is these qualities which detract from the film. Cary Grant is not simply pursued by this wilful heroine but positively harassed. Many audiences of the time did not take to Hepburn. The film is typical fast moving, fast talking Howard Hawks (the director) and the supporting cast are excellent but there is no sane character to ground the film and Hawks himself felt this was why it failed.    This 2 disk package contains some great extras. The print is excellent and Peter Bogdanovich provides an unusual commentary, quoting from Hawks himself and observing how the filming occurred, very much from a director's viewpoint.  Bogdanovich remade the film of sorts as \\"What's up Doc\\" with Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neill in the 70s  and that suffered from the same relentless heroine as this film does.     There are 2 really good documentaries included. The first is a TCM film on the life of Cary Grant. It would have to be the definitive work on the star with appearances by 3 of his wives providing great insight into his personality.  The other documentary is one of a series about filmmakers, \\"The Men who Made Movies\\", cutting together a couple of interviews with Howard Hawks. It is particularly amusing to hear him comment on the French critics who have overanalysed his legacy when all he says is 'I did it because I liked it and if I did not like it, I did it until I did.\\" It is great to hear the director skewer their pretentions.    Lastly, there is a technicolour short film from the Warner's vault and a very young Susan Hayward can be glimpsed poolside. The cartoon is a takeoff of Hollywood stardom with the heroine goose imitating Katharine Hepburn. The Howard Hawks trailer gallery is really a marketing exercise.    The DVD is excellent value but even better if purchased as part of the Classic Comedy set from MGM/Warners.
B000R5N1MC|5.0|This set is awesome - especially the extra discs with outakes and interviews.  I compared the DVD version I bought in 1997 with the HD DVD I picked up from Amazon -- there were some subtle differences in the picture quality -- improved quality on the HD DVD over the old DVD.  Glad I bought it before Toshiba pulled the plug on further HD DVD development.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The only flaw I could find in this movie is the lack of sunshine.  We only see the sun for about 10 minutes in a 4 hour movie.  Not even the heaviest industrialized cities are this dark and bleak.  Other than that this movie contains the most romantic scenes that I have ever watched.  Beautiful movie!
B000MR9D5E|2.0|It goes without saying that the BBC series Planet Earth has been one of the most highly praised nature programs in years.  And, in a number of ways, the excellent reviews were well earned.  Having said that, I can't recommend Planet Earth.    My main problem with Planet Earth is that invariably mixed in with the wonderful footage was one scene after the next of animals tearing each other to pieces.  Admittedly this kind of carnage is an integral part of nature and a necessary factor in \\"the great circle of life.\\"  But I took offense to the overwrought dramatization of these segments.  Narrator David Attenborough would inevitably switch to sinister tones and deliver lines such as \\"But little did these creatures know that a hungry predator was close by.\\"  Then the music would change to minor chords to increase the tension and the viewer is then subjected to graphic shots of an animal being ripped apart.  In one of the early episodes there were five separate scenes of animals slaughtering each other within the first 25 minutes.  Yes, such events are commonplace on the planet Earth, but this series would have you believe that there is *nothing* else happening in nature except one bloodbath after the next.    I thought that I'd be given a reprieve in one of the most highly praised episodes \\"Caves.\\"  How bad could it be seeing a bat gulp down a moth?  Instead we see a bat accidentally trapped in a pile of guano--its very human-like hand back-lit and reaching up during the animal's death throes while being consumed by cockroaches and centipedes.  Disturbing and overly graphic.    It was a huge disappointment for me that this series, with so much footage that could truthfully be called \\"miraculous\\", would instead choose to liberally pepper this potentially wonderful program with limbs being torn off, bloody feathers flying through the air and music that wouldn't have been out of place in John Williams' Jaws soundtrack.  Planet Earth had wonderful potential, but for me in the end it was mainly just a gore fest.
B000063DI8|5.0|First off let me state that all bruce/maiden cd's are 4.5 - 5 stars in my opinion. but everyone likes things differently. I just remember getting this on cassette and wearing it out. no not adventurous as the previous 2 cd's, but still a good listen.This combines the twin guitar playing of Dave Murray and the new at this time Janick Gers, with the soaring vocals of Bruce Dickinson, accompanied by Nicko McBain on the drums and Steve Harris on Bass, to make truly great album. The songs on this album are good, especially Bring your daughter...to the Slaughter, and Holy Smoke. True, this isn't their best album, and for people just discovering Iron Maiden, I would recommend either Brave New World, or The Number of the Beast, but this album is still an excellent album to listen to, for any fan of Classic Heavy Metal.

006135323X|5.0|Classical economic theories are based on the assumption that consumers behave rationally, despite a considerable body of evidence to the contrary. It is only in the last 25 years that economists have begun to investigate the irrational side of consumer behavior. This field of investigation, which started with the pioneering work of Tversky and Kahneman, is usually referred to as  behavioral economics.<br /><br />Dan Ariely's book, \\"Predictably Irrational\\", offers a clear and engaging overview of this fascinating subject. If you are the kind of person (like me) who can't imagine using the words 'fascinating' and 'economics' in the same sentence, don't worry, the primary focus of the book is human behavior and its peculiarities, rather than economic theory. In particular, the author is concerned with elucidating how and why people continue to engage in behavior patterns that are detrimental in the long term.<br /><br />In thirteen well-written chapters, Ariely considers such topics as:<br /><br />* The effect of our need for a reference point before we can judge the value of something, and how clever marketers can exploit this<br />* How we can become trapped by our own behavior - the importance of first decisions<br />* How the prospect of getting something free can override reason and logic (is it really smart to wait for free-entrance night at the museum?)<br />* The effect of social norms (why you are more likely to agree to help your local charity by working for nothing, than for a quarter of your normal professional rate)<br />* The influence of arousal (we behave irrationally in the throes of passion - what you can do about it)<br />* The problems of procrastination and self-control<br />* Our tendency to place too much value on what we already own<br />* The destructive consequences of people's tendency to want to keep as many options open for as long as possible<br />* How our expectations of something can actually influence our ability to enjoy it<br />* The power of price (response to a $2.50 placebo is better than that to a 10c placebo)<br />* In what situations are people particularly likely to behave dishonestly? How can the triggers for dishonest behavior be disarmed?<br /><br />The book is based primarily on work that Ariely has done with colleagues at M.I.T. and elsewhere. Two features make the book exceptional, in my opinion:<br /><br />1.  The ability of Ariely and colleagues to devise really neat experiments to test their hypotheses. All of the conclusions in the book are convincingly supported by often remarkably clever experiments. Even in cases where you might not agree completely with Ariely's conclusions, the experiments are described clearly enough and in sufficient detail to allow you to draw your own conclusions.<br />2.  Ariely does an extraordinary job of making his material interesting and accessible to a general audience. The book was a joy to read.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Predictably Irrational\\".that to a 10c placebo)  * In what situations are people particularly likely to behave dishonestly?

B000R7I3LY|5.0|As we all know, first albums can be hard on an artist--what with record producers pressuring them to keep it simple, straightforward and repetitive until they know if it will sell, etc--and this is a brilliant first attempt. Although Sara's songs all have the same flow, the rhythm and style changes to create a good variety of gorgeous, emotional songs. The differences between the hit Love Song, the lesser-known Gravity, and the darkly stunning Come Round Soon create a really nice flow to the album. Although I personally didn't really enjoy the track Vegas, the rest of the songs on this album blew me away. Sara's vocal styling and lyrics are vaguely reminiscent of Nina Gordon (\\"Tonight and the Rest of My Life\\"), another favorite artist of mine. Sara Bareilles is a welcome change from your average, irritating \\"Top 40\\" artists. Can't wait for the next album!
0143038419|2.0|I thought this book would be very good (according to the reviews on Amazon) but the author is very selfish and to hear about her \\"painful\\" divorce gets annoying after a while. Its a book that you will forget quick because it has no meaning whatsoever. I dont understand how this book got all theese ratings but I say, its not wroth reading.
0743277708|5.0|The title of this review is, as best I remember, a jacket quote from the first edition of _Watership Down_ I read.  Unlike almost any other, it accurately reflects the experience of and reasons for reading and rereading this book.    _Watership Down_ is sometimes spoken of as a fantasy, a political allegory, and I'm sure much else, but at its heart it is simply beautiful storytelling.  The 'lapine' myths are canny, pointed, and exciting, while the main storyline keeps you rooting for the good guys while still understanding the motivations of the few villains.  It's great to gain such \\"insight\\" into the private lives of rabbits :-) (much like Poortvliet & Huygens's _Gnomes_) but that's not why we read Adams's masterpiece.  We read it to identify with a great literary journey, one to give us strength in our own sojourns.
0743298039|1.0|I think this book is strange. The beginning seems very interesting and promising but once i got to the middle it got very wierd and boring. I couldnt even finish it, because it got to a point where i truely didnt care about what would happen, because i didnt care too much for the books main characters. This book was way too long and  not interesting to me im sorry.

B000002H92|5.0|Of the earlier live albums, this is the best release to get as it culls all of Absolutely Live, all of Alive She Cried, and a couple of other tracks (from Live at the Hollywood Bowl and American Prayer) onto two discs.<br /><br />The first disc and one track from the second are taken from Absolutely Live, which was producer Paul Rothchild's amazing sonic mock-up of a complete Doors show.  Edited together from a number of shows recording in '69 and '70, it sounds like a single Doors show but apparently has \\"about 2,000 edits\\", according to Rothchild himself.<br /><br />The sound quality on all of the material is excellent, particularly the AB tracks.  The album runs nearly the full range of Doors material, including a full live version of Celebration of the Lizard, an amazing The End, a stonking Who Do You Love, Break On Through, and plenty more, including memorable poetry from Morrison and in-between chatting and audience banter.  It all opens with the house announcer's warning from the fire marshall...<br /><br />The Doors have been releasing a lot of excellent live material over the past decade on the Bright Midnight Records label, including most of the Absolutely Live material uncut and complete with no overdubs or trickery.  Since Rothchild claimed it was difficult to get a complete take of a Doors fan (good enough for the demands of an official live LP), he resorted to the AB method.  The full shows are still pretty amazing---the band was only human, anyway.<br /><br />This is still recommended--specifically to more casual fans who may not want to buy all of the Bright Midnight shows or may not be as obsessed with complete shows or tapes.  The song selection is excellent, just a wealth of choice material.

B000URDEB0|5.0|Yes, Tarja's gone. It's a horrible, horrible shame. The potent operatic passion she brought to Nightwish music can never be replaced. That being said, reviewers and Nightwish fans, get over it. It's a new era.    Anyone that knows anything about singing knows that Anette's voice is anything but bad. It's powerful, and she is far from \\"tone deaf\\" (as one especially ignorant reviewer pointed out). It's a different style. Yes, it is more \\"rock\\" like than Tarja's is. Is that honestly a bad thing? She does a perfectly good job filling the shoes (and I am an avid Nightwish fan and have heard everything Tarja and the band have ever recorded).    Going track by track it is clear that some of this is reminiscent of American metal bands, which I agree is not something to praise. For instance, although it is a very good song, \\"Cadence of Her Last Breath\\" sounds like it was meant to be a Lacuna Coil song. Also, \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" does sound like they were trying to remake \\"Wish I Had An Angel\\" (woman singing verses, man singing chorus, guitars not changing pitch during chorus, same template, etc.). However, there is so much good here that the bad just gets pushed aside.    First of all, \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" is a masterpiece. Say what you will about her voice, but when Anette belts the chorus in the second movement I shiver. The orchestra is used to its full potential in this song, and the result is a 13 minute opus to a doomed songwriter that seems to pass in about 5 minutes. \\"Amaranth\\" is a decent single, but the album shines on \\"Eva\\", \\"Sahara\\", \\"The Islander\\", \\"Last of the Wilds\\", and \\"7 Days to the Wolves\\". \\"Meadows of Heaven\\" is an interesting closer, and \\"Master Passion Greed\\" reminds me of the Wishmaster days.     All in all, listen to this album for what it is, not what it \\"should\\" be based on previous efforts from the band. And put on \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\", and see if you don't fall in love with Nightwish all over again.

The story it tells, while shaded from the true story told in the book of the same title, is still essentially true and gives us reason to be humbled and honored that men like these exist and are willing to do these things for us.<br /><br />I already had the DVD version and bought the Blu Ray because I read a review that said it is even better. It is better, but not a lot. If you don't have the DVD version, get the Blu Ray. If you have the DVD, you don't need the Blu Ray.

It is approachable for the non-sci-fi/space western fan... my wife loves it.  It took us an episode or two to get into it, but it was well worth it.
0307275639|1.0|This book is probably beneficial for careerists too absorbed in an objective-oriented, material world to value the other aspects of life, especially being a testimony from one of their own. As an instrument of social change, 3 stars.    But it is essentially useless to anyone else with a pre-existing and healthy skepticism of human nature, activity, and group functioning. For this, no stars.    More points off for cheesy melodrama, giving a grand total of 1 star.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|Based on Richard Matheson's excellent 1960 novel of the same name, \\"I Am Legend\\" is a welcome, but disappointing adaptation.  Much commentary has been made about the protagonist's nemeses - the ghoulish nocturnal zombies - and their lack of believability. That impression is caused both by unfortunate choices in casting and in pop-cultural references. Star Will Smith recently appeared in a weak adaptation of Asimov's classic \\"I Robot\\" in which CGI robots dominated the screen.  Smith's presence reminds the viewer of the similarity of those robots to the latter film's zombies. He also starred in \\"Men In Black,\\" a film which opened with a CGI alien howling, shaking his head in the same manner as the zombies. There are prominent scenes in \\"Legend\\" in which the characters watch the animated film \\"Shrek,\\" another landmark effort in CGI. Inevitably, the viewer's mind is drawn to parallels between the peculiarities of the zombies' movements and those of the earlier films.<br /><br />All of that aside, is \\"Legend\\" any good? It's mildly diverting, but any adaptation of Matheson's book must capture the terrible stillness of the soul that the last man on Earth must feel.  This film is too busy to elicit that mood, despite its attempts at pathos. There are two endings for this film: the alternate ending is more thoughtful, and is foreshadowed early in the film; I would therefore recommend the two-disc version.

B000063DS1|5.0|If I could create my heaven, I would ask to be onstage listening to the Last Waltz for eternity.  This concert puts today's music to shame--no 100 dancers, no sex shows, no makeup & backflips, no studio effects, no bodyguards just jammin'.  Musicians as real people and confident artists with ability using their instruments (watch American Idol after watching this film and you'll feel embarassed for the truly amateur talent).  No wonder today's music scene, overly produced and commercialized, is going to the toilet.<br /><br />While the music is first rate, nothing compares to the film and watching these musicians perform.  Danko playing his guitar so effortlessly, Robertson smoking every song, and Levon Helms yodeling is a sight to see.  My favorites, Cripple Creek, Joni Mitchell's Coyote, Muddy Waters Mannish, Dr. John Such a Night, and the incomparable Van Morrison singing Caravan.<br /><br />Levon Helms complained that this film featured too much Robbie Robertson & if it does (though I don't think so) that's scorsese and Hollywood, always gravitating toward the pretty face and the graceful profile to sell the picture.  The only members who get short shrift are perhaps Manuel behind the piano and Hudson, totally introspective anyway and looking like the mad professor.  can you see what a music label would do with these guys today?  Make them sing with britney.<br /><br />and sorry robbie--neil diamond didn't belong there.

This film has a plot and dialogue so stupid it makes my brain hurt.  This is alose the garbage that gets nominated for an oscar (anyone who's had to sit threw this film and can string two words together knows what I mean). You wonder how some films get made, or get good reviews when they are complete waste's of film, it's because of those people who love overhyped crappy movies. They will probally demand a sequel or a TV series. I can see it now \\"Juno II: Here We Go Again and Juno III: Third Times A Charm ***** two thumbs up amazing! Breath-taking!\\" GARBAGE!!!!
1594489505|5.0|I was so astonished after reading THE KITE RUNNER. I had no expectations before reading the author's first novel so I was greatly surprised and marveled by the quality and deepness of both the story and characters.     Then I ran to the library for A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS and I was once more taken away by a poignant story of love, family and friendship. The story takes place in Afghanistan and covers 40 years of history (as in The KR). The main characters are two women from two generations. War, religion and faith make their life a common path filled with love, violence, terror and sacrifice. They have to fight under the Taliban reign to live and save children they love.     I just don't understand how people can give one star to such a great story. Alright, you may not love it but I can't believe nothing reaches you in this book.    For those asking which book is the best... hard to tell as both are great novels. I think I preferred THE KITE RUNNER. I think most women will prefer A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS. Anyway, read both! They are worth every penny spent on them !!    If Hosseini's future books are to be of similar quality, he will surely be among my favorite authors.

The earlier version had only 9 songs on it.  This 1999 update includes The Pinnacle, The Devil Game, and the \\"Live\\" version of Closet Chronicles, previously on the 2 record set, Two For The Show.<br /><br />For a single disc \\"Best of\\", it's not bad.  KANSAS has so many great tracks from a dozen albums it's hard to decide exactly what to include.  The easy ones are the definitive hits, such as Dust In the Wind, Carry On Wayward Son, Song for America, and Hold On.<br /><br />For the Fans who want everything that KANSAS has to offer, it's an easy choice, since this CD is the only place to obtain the Live version of Closet Chronicles that was omitted from the Compact disc version of Two for the Show, so it could a single disc also. Otherwise, this is just a place for the casual fan to get some basic KANSAS music.  A good place for someone to get acquainted with the bands most popular songs.  Isn't that what \\"Best of's\\" are for?<br /><br />True fans will already have all the bands individual CD's.
B00008G9JM|5.0|Oh sure, Thick as a Brick was the more popular of the concept Jethro Tull albums.  That doesn't mean A Passion Play deserves to be automatically dismissed.  While it's true the entire piece doesn't flow perfectly (because of some awkward storytelling moments in particular) it's really not any worse than Thick as a Brick.  I think BOTH albums deserve to be in your collection to be quite honest.      Of course, an even bigger question is probably \\"How many Jethro Tull albums do you need?\\" since most of them sound pretty much the same.  Well to be honest, only a few, and this album should probably not be one of them.  Stand Up, Benefit and Aqualung are the ultimate Jethro Tull albums.  Pick up those three first.  Some would argue Living in the Past deserves to be among the classics, and who am I to disagree?  I can't!  So go with whatever you want.

B000007UXD|5.0|Wow, this is one powerful rock album.  It pack a serious MEAN and NASTY punch.  It's raw, straight forward, simple rock and roll with the volume turned WAY up.  But wait!  That's not all!  The band members also give us some highly enjoyable guitar soloing in the title song.  This band was truly at their very best in the early days.      Pick it up today and hear how AC/DC used to sound a long time ago when rock and roll was all about innovation and power.  Why didn't hard rock bands hold back in the early days?  Because it would have been boring to do so.  AC/DC knew that's not the direction they wanted to take their music.  They didn't want to be the first band to hold back their amazing talent.      When albums this good are released, you just don't know what to DO with yourself.  You can't believe the speakers in your home haven't rocked all the way across the living room and into the coffee table, knocking off flowers and coffee cups.  A guitar sound SO LOUD it almost cracks the speakers in half and leaves you begging for more, despite the damage you know the guitar playing will cause to your stereo system.    But you know what?  We keep coming back to it.  We keep coming back to the music and we make it the greatest music we've ever heard in our lives.
B000002LE6|5.0|yes, prince released this album only after the \\"defunked\\" black album was pulled, and then subsequently re-released.  this album is perhaps prince's most perfect album...the black album being a close second...listen to them both back to back...but to say that one is better than the other is crazy.  what did he release just after the whole lovesexy/black album \\"thing\\"?....\\"batman\\"...he played batman, gemini, joker, and other characters in that morality play of light and dark...prince is \\"the man\\" displaying the best and worst in human nature in the same mirror...pick any prince album, listen to it alone with your subconscious, and make your own evaluations...every album and every experience is different.  peace.
B00111L0MY|5.0|This movie I bought mainly due to reviews and I am glad I did.It was a very realistic movie meaning it is something that could happen any given day.The people are all believable there wasn't anyone that played a part that didn't fit in.As far as movies go this one is something you could watch soon after watching it the first time,its that enjoyable.
006135323X|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I enjoyed most of it.  The book begins to drag a little towards the end but overall it was a good book.  A pleasant read with enough humor to keep it lively.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|First off, I have watched Stargate since the show started in 90's and I was a big fan of the original movie, so I was really excited to see a Stargate Movie! After watching it though, the movie actually seemed rushed, what I would have liked to have seen was this movie as the series finale on TV.    The whole Ori thing was beaten to death in the last two years of the show and the introduction of Vala(whatever her name is)over the last two seasons was a major disappointment for me, her character is boring and and out of place. Oh, and the replicators.. That is just old and tiresome, I actually lost interest in the movie when they introduced the replicators. And that whole fight scene at the end, that seemed to long and drawn out as well.    Having watched the show I was disappointed that Richard Dean Anderson didn't make an appearance in the movie, his character was so well done through the years he was on the show that he really needed to be in this one as he is really a critical part of SG1 and what made those shows so good.    Don't get me wrong, if you are a fan you will enjoy it just don't expect a lot.. Go into it like you are watching an episode from the last two seasons of the show and you should be okay.
0385338724|4.0|The book doesn't get 4 stars for being exceptional literature but, instead, for having an original storyline and an ending that doesn't compromise the story or its characters. If you're familiar with the premise of the ABC show `Samantha Who?' then you'll have a good idea of what this book is about. Lexi, our main character, wakes up from a car accident with no memory of the past three years. In her mind/life it's 2004 when, in fact, it's 2007. She has to play catch-up with her own life and that includes a complete makeover from how she used to look, a good-looking multi-millionaire husband, and broken friendships. Lexi receives very little support from her friends and family - in fact that was something that surprised me; the people surrounding Lexi were not interested in helping her at all. Lexi struggles, mostly alone, to figure out her life and piece together memories. The only person willing to fill in the blanks is Jon, an architect her husband works with. The book isn't perfect and I think the ending will surprise a lot of people because it's not perfect either. I enjoy Kinsella's books that are not linked to the Shopaholic series and this was no exception.
B000O75F7C|5.0|I own must Porcupine Tree albums. In Absentia is my favorite PT album, and \\"Sound of Muzak\\" and \\"Trains\\" my favorite songs. So now you know my taste.<br /><br />I will recommend this album because of the song Anesthetize. It is a jewel, so beautiful, so well done. Alex Lifeson's solo is a nice touch to the song, but it is not the only reason to love this track. Steven Wilson guitars sounds so unique, and so cool. Being a prog fan most of the time I feel like listening to music of the past, even with new bands. But with PT I feel like listening to a fresh band, a band produced with a fashioned ear. Bass lines, drum parts, keyboard ambiance, all instruments played to perfection and with a lot of passion. This is not a show off band, they use their talent to make beautiful new textures and colors, and the music complexity that have earned them the prog rock tag is just the way the compositions ended up being, but not the main porpuse of the recording.<br /><br />If still in doubt, go buy the Arriving Somewhere DVD and come back to Fear of a Blank Planet later.
B0013FFMOK|5.0|My family and I liked the movie. My children especially(12,10 yrs old). I think if you are an average Joe who's not into picking and critiqueing a movie to death you will enjoy this film. I can see the \\"points\\" of some of the reviewers but then again this is fiction not a fact based movie so nothing to get in a hype about. I mean it's just a movie. I have never read the book so I can't compare. I would recommend checking it out and deciding for yourself if ya like it. Maybe rent it first and if ya like it pick up a copy at Amazon's great price. Also you can find and view the alternate ending online which is also good.
0143038419|5.0|I received this as a gift and began reading so I could at least let my friend know I'd opened the first page.    I couldn't put it down!  While different in our personal contexts, I felt that her personal journey over the year was similar to my own life.  Discontent in traditional life expectations, daring to move on.  I relived by week in Italy with her stories.  I remembered the spiritual advances I've made (though not in India, or through meditation), and enjoyed reading about her learning to love on terms she was comfortable with.    I don't think this book is for everyone.  If you love your cookie-cutter lifestyle with the spouse, 2 kids, dog and a minivan - you won't get this book.  On the other hand, if you're the kind of person that questions the status quo and tries to live on your own terms - this book might be for you!  :)
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Will Ferrell portrays well an IRS auditor Harold Click who has led a monotonous and uneventful life. He barely smiles, meets friends and attends no social gatherings. Emma Thompson's voice in his head is an excellent narrative, an indispensable thread that links the plot together. Only four more main characters appear in the movie - the baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal) later turned his love interest, the literary professor (Dustin Hoffman) who offered professional help to seek the voice's identity, the author (Emma Thompson) who suffered from writer's block for nearly 10 years and the assistant from the publisher (Queen Latifah) who came to her rescue.     The fact that the director focused only around the boring life of Harold Click proved to be a refreshing perspective. No way that everyone could have tons of friends, family support and affluent life. Every main character leads a simple life. Maggie Gyllenhaal, the baker, simply makes cookies, cakes and gives away generously to the needy. Dustin Hoffman works from an office with a breathtaking view. At one point, he looked through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Emma Thompson is a neurotic, unsocial author living in an apartment with minimalist design. And Queen Latifah looks a confident and caring professional who has promised to help Emma Thompson end her novel quietly and efficiently. (This means killing the character Harold Click the best way possible.)    Looking back, I like the movie for its subtle tone, excellent cinematography of the city, portrayal of relationships just as it is without stereotyping. The life of Harold Click is boring but the narration of his life is not. Instead I can grow to like him and wish him all the best. What I learn from this movie - one can empathize and be a good person without saying too much, one can be in the spotlight of the movie without being a hero credited with big deeds, good look and in an important situation. As Harold Click said in the movie, there are mundane moments and significant moments in life. And in this movie, the baker, the author, the assistant, the professor and Harold Click himself have done some seemingly insignificant things that have made significant changes in other peoples' lives. And a movie needs to be loud to make a lasting impression. I like this movie.
B00006IU73|5.0|Great songs, brilliant musicians = the best band. Buy it, then buy Deadwing and Fear Of A Blank Planet too. All different and all fantastic.
140120306X|1.0|I was looking forward to getting this in the mail so much.  I opened the box brimming with excitement.  Then I tried to read it.  To say getting through the entire book was painful is an understatement.  I read every word and the more I read the more bored and tired I became.  By the end I was glad it was over and very unhappy to have spent my money on this book.  Mr. Moore is my favorite comic book writer, but he missed the mark on this book by a huge margin.
B0007XT87G|5.0|The best band on the planet right now. Truly great songs with great musicians playing them.
B000YABYLA|5.0|The story line was nothing spectacular. The actors on the other hand were phenomenal. Every one of them!  Ellen Page is one of the most delightful actors I've ever seen. I can't wait to see more of her.  Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner were excellent.  The characters of Juno's dad and stepmother were also wonderful.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Works wonderfully - super easy to bounce, gives great fill flash without hood shadows, recycles quickly and weighs almost nothing. Cheapest way to make a significant improvement in harshly lit or indoor shots, period. Great buy.
B0010ZR160|1.0|This movie was pretty good up until the ending.  The ending was just stupid.  I also have to say that there are some scenes in this movie that are very disturbing. During one scene, and it was just a flash, split second of a scene, I was so disturbed and can't believe they felt the need to add that into the movie.  We got what happened..you didn't have to show it. Ugh. All that aside, Casey Affleck was great.  Awesome, talented actor.
B000V67588|5.0|Supertramp's Crime of the Century album is the best album that Supertramp ever produced.  Much like Pink Floyd's album Dark Side of the Moon; Crime of the Century is a dark introspective look at life.  Crime of the Century produced 2 hit songs; Bloody Well Right and Dreamer that got a lot of FM radio play in the early-mid 70's.  In 1978 Supertramp produced the much more commercial album Breakfast in America.    If you are going to own one Supertramp album it should be Crime of the Century
0321525655|5.0|This picks up from Turfte's \\"Beautiful Evidence\\" book and more so. If you give presentations at all you need this book. It is so far the best book on Powerpoint (Keynote) I have read. The ideas are not just talked about, you walk through how to do it with plenty of before and after pictures. A very graphical and stunning book.  If you have ever felt that your audience was just not getting your message, or you understand why Steve Jobs out presents Bill Gates, or you appreciate the Guy Kawasaki style, then this is the book for you. Buy it, read and use it and do not lend it!
B0007OCG4W|1.0|The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's reassuring to think that no events similar to the events in this movie have ever happened. Not that no one has ever cheated, lied and generally behaved like a scumball, but that no one has done so for such incomprehensible and arbitrary reasons or with such utterly unconvincing dialog. In fact, \\"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\\" had rather more realistic dialog than this movie. In scene after scene, we're supposed to believe that there is sexual tension between these characters, even though they actually just seem to despise each other and feel very awkward around each other. \\"Time\\" magazine apparently called this \\"a love story for adults.\\" All I can say about that is that if adults actually behaved like this, then civilization would collapse in less than a year.
B0001I562I|4.0|I was in junior high when this movie came out and really enjoyed it.  Watching it now, as a 35 year old, I still find it to be an entertaining science fiction film.  The acting is nothing special and the lead character (David) can be annoying at time, as is Pee Wee Herman as the alien entity.  And even though the science (including space time travel) is theoretically possible, the movie is a bit far fetched at times.  However, it is a fun film that will capture your imagination, much like E.T.  It's nice to see the occasional (rare) science fiction film that portrays alien species as \\"friendly\\" and not hostile aggressors looking to overthrow our planet.  This is a good Disney film.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|The cartoony quality made it feel more like a video game. It probably looked great on Imax 3-D. There were some great visuals but, overall, I think Peter Jackson proved you can have CGI AND truly live action work together with these themes (wait, didn't a guy named Disney prove that too?). Not enough 'moment's' to bring it together. This was, in my opinion, about on-par with last year's '300'
1416523359|4.0|As someone who'd never read a Stephen King before, but was looking for a novel with the theme of a lost spouse, I enjoyed it a lot. Although it may not be for those who are fans of the usual Stephen King type of work. Tragic and heartfelt, rather than scary. Some of the made-up words were a little confusing, some wording even edging on annoying, until I got into the story. By the end, I was sad that it was over.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I was pleased that I completed my set of the Gilmore Girls series and at $19.99, what a bargain.  I give this 5 stars because I had no problems with my DVDs or any part of the transaction with Amazon.  But as a die-hard fan of the show, I too was totally disappointed with the entire 7th season and the ending of the series.  I also feel cheated.  This was such a awesome series from the very beginning and to end it the way it ended was a total misrepresentation of what this story was about.  It's been rumored that a GG movie may someday come from Amy Sherman-Pallodino and if that is the case, the fans will be redeemed with the proper ending to this show. We can only hope!

B0013FDM7E|3.0|Richard Matheson's book has a 'hook' that has never been exploited in any adaptaptation (although the Vincent Price version is the closest) and that is the variation on the 'One-Eyed Man in the country of the blind...'  The Vampires have taken over - there is no cure  Accept it - they have  And that's the point.  When you are the only odd one in a world that has been turned topsy turvey - night is day and day is night - then you are the monster and the monsters are normal.  Civilization continues in the hours of darkness, and mankind somehow adapts.  It is perfectly logical that they would try to destroy the creature that's killing them while they sleep, and that they would fear him.  Neville's final words in the book \\"I am anaethema - I am legend.\\" sums it all up.  When mutation is normality - the normal man is a monster to be feared and destroyed.  Someday, some screewriter and director will figure this out and tell Matheson's story.  This isn't it.

0743486285|5.0|In a word, 'riveting'.  It is hard to imagine someone could abuse themselves to this degree and make it out alive.  Shockingly graphic, brutally honest, impossible to put down.  I read this book in one day.  Readers will be amazed at how lucid, and often funny, Nikki's thoughts are, even at the height of his drug and alcohol abuse.  Truly incredible story.
0316067598|5.0|Very well written with a solid insight into BUDS and the way great men with excellent training make the finest warriors.
0452289963|5.0|Didn't know what to expect when I bought this book...Was it going to be preachy, biased, bible-thumping, brimstone & fire, dull, repetitive of other type books? Happy to review that it's none of the above & quite possibly the best of its kind ever written or will be written in the future. Has opened my heart, mind & soul to the condition the average human is in & how to cope with it. The first book ever read that I have added my own footnotes to pages & highlighted \\"aha\\" sentences! I usually pass on books to others after reading but this is a book you keep & refer back to when you need some extra encouragement dealing with life. If everyone read & understood this book the world would be in a much better place! Will be buying this book for others if they haven't already purchased one for themselves.
B00002E224|5.0|I don't really going into great big detail over movies but this is really good, I truly love this movie it really feels true-to-life to say. You should watch it and the sequel Before Sunset as well.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Eddie Vedder is the perfect voice and artist for this CD and it sounds great.  The hard voice fits the slow songs and the slightly faster ones.  Its a beautiful soundtrack that really gets across the right feelings and moods.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I remember sitting in the theater watching this film and waiting to be charmed.  The visuals were great, the costuming appropriate, the details superb.  But where was the humour, the charm, the wit and the wondeful characters that makes me read the novel again and again?  Some of the things that I love about Jane Austen is her social satire and her explication of human foibles, which have not changed all that much in three hundred years.  All you get with this film (presumably in an effort to make it \\"relevant\\" to modern viewers) is a lot of noise/yelling, bad acting (even from Dame Judy Dench!!), and the overwhelming feeling that the majority of the actors were miscast. The makers of this film stripped away all the humour of the novel and left me dissatisfied and suffering from a bad headache.  If you really want to experience a version of Pride and Prejudice with the spirit of Jane Austen gloriously intact, search out the 2004[?] version with Colin Firth.  That film is an  absolute delight.
0425210480|3.0|The Cussler formula cranks out yet another wild adventure.  History is re-written (this time only going back to World War II), a scientific formula is uncovered that could cause the end of life on earth, and our hero must stop a band of anarchists who mistakenly think they can use the formula to gain control of the planet's communications.  Somewhere along the way wooly mammoths come out of extinction (which was a weird side story) and an underground city is found in the north.      This book reads fast and you get the feeling the authors were only going through the motions of writing it.  But if you have never read a Cussler book before, you might enjoy America's version of James Bond.
630522577X|5.0|I've noticed in reading the reviews already posted that most people want to debate the casting of the film, and that's fine. Others want to debate whether or not George Bernard Shaw would be angry at the ending (which he actually did pen for the 1930s version of Pygmalion.)   That's all fine.    But here is my honest opinion of the film, and it's romantic plotline. First of all, it's beautiful. The scenery, the costumes, and the music. But the ambiguity of the Higgins/Eliza \\"sort of romance\\" has always been one of my favorite things about this film. Why? Because the one thing good ol' George Bernard Shaw got right about this script (be it his original theatrical ending or the film ending) is that it shows us the different types of love between men and women. Not all love is eros and passionate. It is more subtle.     At the age of 10, I found this ending incredibly frustrating. Now as I approach my mid-twenties, I find it real and heartfelt. Perhaps, Higgins and Eliza remain platonic. Or, maybe Higgins and Eliza decide to marry? Maybe she does run off and marry Freddy. This sort of thing is best decided by the individual. But one thing is certain, they are most wonderfully in love, be it conventional or unconventional.    And that's just loverly.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|If you loved the movie you have to get the soundtrack.<br />It hasn't left my cd player since I recieved it. I loved the movie.<br />It was one of the best interpretations of Beatles music that I have heard in quite awhile. The soundtrack cd follows the movie. All songs are sung by the original cast members.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Whoever said a fairy tale had to be animated and include magic, wizards, dragons and the like?  Freddie Highmore sets us up for a fairy tale in the opening sequence, and we are given a whole new one.  And it's certainly a breath of fresh air.    Evan (Highmore) was separated from his mother at birth and sent to live in a boys' home.  He is considered a freak because he hears music in everything and believes his parents will come for him.  He runs away and finally finds a way to put what he hears in his head on paper, and later on show, hoping two certain audience members will be listening.  The music is the high point, as well as Highmore, Russell, and Rhys Meyers.  I highly recommend the soundtrack as well.    Is the story believable?  No, it's a Hollywood movie.  Is it a run of the mill fairy tale?  No.  Welcome to the 21st century.  Listen and enjoy the music.
0375847227|5.0|Move over Harry Potter!    I'm 28 years old, and was forced to read this trilogy by a friend.  It took me a bit to get into, but then again I'm not really a sci-fi/fantasy fan.  If truth be told, I double majored in college, and one of my major was English, with my concentration in British Lit., romantic era.    However, when I got into the third chapter or so, I couldn't put the book down!  On the surface it's such a page turner, with such imagination, unique characters, and witty lines.    Divulge deeper, and there is so much there that in order to absorb it all, you would have to re-read it again...and again...and again in order to hope to grasph all the meanings, a sign of a great book.    I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an easy read, with deep meaning, and to people of all ages.
B00000DRXW|5.0|Any one of these guitarists will stun you with their technique. Al Dimeola, John McLaughlin, and Paco de Lucia are outstanding musicians who have produced some really good work individually. Put them all together under one roof for a night of jamming and you have one great concert recording.     Each of the players here has a unique style, so there's no real sense of things running together. Dimeola is a straight-charger with intense staccato flurries that defy transcription. McLaughlin employs both picked and legato runs, along with a great sense of timing. De Lucia's Spanish flamenco style is smooth and elegant. From start to finish, all three turn in top notch performances. Highly recommended for those who appreciate excellent guitar music.
0385338724|3.0|If you've seen the movie \\"13 Going on 30\\" or read the book \\"This Body\\" by Laurel Doud, you will recognize the plot of this book, but it is still entertaining and a very quick read.    Lexie Smart is unhappy with her job, looks, and love life when she is involved in traffic accident.  When she wakes up, she thinks it's the next morning, but it's actually 3 years later and she is gorgeous, thin, has perfect teeth (snaggletooth is completely gone), has a rich husband, an unbelievable high power job and a gorgeous lover on the side.  But is she happy?  And how did this all come about?    Sophie Kinsella continues to delight her fans with her amusing dialogues between characters and her lovable heroines.  This is not as good as the Shopaholic series but as long as you know the plotline is not original, you will still enjoy it.    Reading time - one sitting.
0596009208|2.0|I was referred the book for a java class for a job i'm going to. However, once starting to read the book, i realize it has some problems with it. Perhaps i was simply the wrong person for the book.     1) There are notes and small written comments, pictures, and things EVERYWHERE. It makes it kind of tacky and cluttered looking; and what ultimately made me throw the book to the side. Example. In code examples, it will have 'hand-written-like' notes all on the right side, following no specific alignment, with arrows pointing to spots in the code. (Ug, This just gives me a headache.)     If you need to read every single thing (or are a strictly visual person)and have trouble understanding the principles behind the explanations, then it might be good to use. Otherwise, this is a big downside.     2) There is no Index at the rear of the book. This would fail horribly if you needed to look up something later unless you knew exactly where you were reading from before.     3) Due to the way the book is written, with all it's notes, you can't skip ahead and skim for a topic you are more interested, you need to read it IN ORDER in order to make sense of it. (Maybe if it's taught in a Junior High School environment it would be more useful)     As a more advanced programmer, this book obviously wasn't for me. I ended up picking up an old copy of 'O'Reilly: Java in a nutshell Second Edition' which told me in the first chapter everything i wanted to know straight up, simple, and answered all my questions re-guarding Java in about 20 pages. (Yes i know it's a old copy, shows how useful it was)     If you want to get your feet wet with Java, buy this book at your own risk. If you are more advanced, (especially with C/C++ programming) go elsewhere, this is a waste of your time.

0307388840|1.0|This novel, in all of its 351 page glory, was an absolute waste of time. First of all, it takes the reader to have read over 150 pages of the novel, before the central conflict is even introduced.  It takes over 150 pages to describe an event in one single day.  The author uses many run-on sentences and loves to describe things to death.  I have to admit that the first couple of chapters were very well written and interesting.  After those first two chapters, the novel pretty much flatlined.  The worst was about 2/3 of the way into the novel, the ravages of war were described in too much detail and really took away from the romance of the novel.  Not to mention, there was hardly any dialogue during these parts of the novel-just banal, endless descriptions.  The most insufferable part was about the last six pages-I couldn't bring myself to finish the last six pages of it, I had to skim it and put the book down.  This is one of the few times you would be better off watching the movie-it was a little bit better than the book.  I honestly don't know what the hype is about!

0618918248|4.0|The God Delusion was ranked number 2 on the Amazon.com bestsellers' list in November 2006. In early December 2006, it reached number 4 in the New York Times Hardcover Nonfiction Best Seller list after nine weeks on the list. As of August 5, 2007, it is still listed at number 29, after 43 weeks on the list.    It brings into question why such a book on this controversial topic, and which is difficult to read, can be so popular. May be it reflects a phenomenon that the uncertainty of god and the present state of religions have created doubt in the mind of many people. The title is an attractive subject to the doubtful. It is also an attractive subject to the faithful. Religious faith is so important for many that they would wish to examine the other side of the argument and ridicule it in order to confirm their faith. If you think this book is talking nonsense, don't worry. Half of the world population may be thinking that way. I am on the other half.    Dawkins said the God Delusion is mainly about the Abrahamic religions, namely religions which have the origin from the god of Abraham, including Judaism, Islam, Catholic, Christian, Orthodox and the like. He thought some religions such as Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism should be labeled ethical systems. I do not agree with him on this point. Although these ethical systems exist, they have been similarly distorted into religion per se by the inclusion of idol worshiping, rituals, blind faith and superstition.    The book shows a lot of examples that the holy books contain many passages which are contradictory, irrational and immoral. This does not come as a surprise as these have been pointed out by many for a long time. When I was in secondary school, a priest who was my teacher in biblical studies explained that the bible was not exact history. They were written by the followers of the apostles recording verbal legends. The bible was then kept by monks and was worshiped at the church. The monks read the bible andadded margin notes of praise and commentaries. When the bible was copied, which was the only way of reproduction in ancient time, all the side notes were included in the text, making some of the meanings inconsistent. When students asked questions on the inconsistency, the priest would explain but usually conclude with the notion of faith, i.e. bible was to be believed, not questioned. This is the main difference between religious belief and scientific belief. When there is a mystery, religion would accept it as god's will. Science would consider it as god's invitation to learn.    The religious non-believer    Following a long period of doubtful tradition, irrationality, superstition, and tyranny during the Dark Ages and the theocratic rule of the Middle Ages, there was the Age of Enlightenment which advocated reason as a means to establishing an authoritative system of aesthetics, ethics, government, and logic, so that human beings could obtain objective truth about the universe. This movement in Europe from about 1650 until 1800 advocated the use of reason and individualism instead of tradition and established doctrine. Although many enlightened intellectual leaders including philosophers and scientists were at awe with the mystery of the universe and the origin of beings, they did not find the holy books and religions satisfactory in answering the mystery. As said by Albert Einstein, \\"I don't try to imagine a personal god; it suffices to stand in awe at the structure of the world, insofar as it allows our inadequate senses to appreciate it.\\"    The God hypothesis    Many people believe god exists, and many people do not. Thus there is a hypothesis that god exists or not. The solution is to find a way to prove it. There has not been any direct proof put forward to prove the existence of god; similarly it is argued that there is also no direct proof that god does not exist. It all boils down to how one looks at this scenario.    Bertrand Russell was a strong advocate that it was not the business of the skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than the dogmatists to prove them. He wrote a parable of the orbiting teapot to illustrate that it was irrational to look for proof that something did not exist. Suppose between the Earth and Mars there was a small teapot revolving about the sun in a elliptical orbit, and that the teapot was too small to be revealed by the most powerful telescopes. Someone could say that this got to be true because it was beyond human ability to doubt it; but this would just be considered nonsense by everybody. However, if the story of the teapot was written in the holy books, any hesitation to believe in its existence would cause the doubter to be persecuted.    Another parable on god's creation was one said by Fred Hoyle of the ultimate Boeing 747. In arguing creation by intelligent design or evolution, Hoyle likened the probability of life originating on Earth was no greater than the chance that a hurricane, sweeping through a scrapyard of aeroplane parts, would have the luck to assemble a Boeing 747. This improbability is termed irreducible complexity. Because of it, life on earth, and everything else, must have been created outright by a designer. The answer of Dawkins, being a biologist and an evolution specialist, was that such parable was ignorant of the nature of natural selection, that life was the result of numerous trials of molecular combinations over trillion of years. It was a gradual process of perfection.    Back to history, Thomas Aquinas of the thirteenth century drew up five proofs on god's existence. These proofs were adopted by the church for several centuries. According to the proofs, god was:  1. The unmoved mover - Everything moves by a mover; by regression there is the last mover that is unmoved.  2. The uncaused cause - Everything is caused by a cause; by regression there is the last cause that is uncaused.  3. The cosmological argument - Physical things exist now; there must be a time when non-physical being brings them into existence.    The first three proofs are the same, being regression to the extreme. It is symbolic of the terminator to the logic, just like positive whole numbers regress to zero. These proofs do not lead to a god with the respected properties of omnipotence, omniscience and goodness.    4. The argument from degree - Everything has a degree of goodness; there is a maximum goodness to set the standard of perfection.  5. The teleological argument or argument from design - Everything in the world looks as if it is designed; thus there is a designer of all things.    The fourth proof deploys comparison. The comparison can be used in any dimension and we cannot call the ultimate standard of anything god. These four proofs are not in use anymore. The fifth proof is the one which is strongly disputed by modern science, but it is the most controversial one as there are still many religious people arguing that, according to the bible, the universe was created eight thousand years ago and the great world flood occurred four thousand years ago created the Grand Canyon.    The roots of religion and morality    The religious explanations of the roots of religion and morality are straight forward and easy to understand. Religion came directly from god together with morality which is god's will. Dawkins proposed that religion created the god delusion, and morality is the behavioural standard mutually accepted in a community. Dean Hamer in his book The God Gene explained why human beings are susceptible to religion. He claimed that a gene VMAT2 was discovered in human DNA. This gene has the effect of a physiological arrangement that produces the sensations associated by some with the presence of god or other mystic experiences, or more specifically spirituality as a state of mind. There is no theory as to how this gene came into the human DNA. A religious perspective is that it could be implanted by god. Evolutionists claimed that it is by natural selection that such a behaviour was gradually developed among human beings as they evolved into a community having leaders, teachers and authority to be followed. The rest was the building up of hierarchy in a community and the devising of the god delusion for the strengthening of governance.    Much examples were quoted to show that morality did not come from religion. While Dawkins showed many quotations from the holy books that much immoral acts were recorded, he also proposed by scientific arguments that moral was a result of natural selection along the evolution path. In the process of evolution, good genes get maintained while bad ones get eliminated. Good or bad genes are defined by their probability to reproduce or be copied. Expanding from genetics, good genes are reflected in the behaviour of the organism in being able to survive. There are some activities that are conducive to survival and sustained existence. One important virtue is the caring for the young, which is essential in the continued existence of the gene. Such behaviour can be found in many kinds of animal, and especially human; thus there is a tendency to care for the young and to reciprocate, care for the parents who provide. Such morality is embedded in our genes and is innate. On the other hand, competition among peers is a necessary evil for survival. We can see this trait among young children where siblings could compete for food, toys and attention, sometimes by lying and violence. They have to be taught to behave well. In such case, morality is acquired in order to maintain the cohesion within a community. Whether innate or acquired, a person does not need religious belief to be moral.    Childhood and Abuse    Dawkins was very critical of the compulsory education on religion for young children. He considered this child abuse because the children were not free in being fed the doctrine of the religion of their parents. I do not agree with him in this line of thought. Children have to be educated. The education they received is the knowledge and thoughts prevailing in his living environment. Although Dawkins listed many examples of child abuse owing to inflexible and superstitious religious rules, this cannot rule out that most children are receiving proper education including a religion of their parents' belief.    The book also mentions the effect of religion on consolation and inspiration. The theory put forward for such effects is the need to fill a gap in human emotion; and this gap could be filled by other means which is non-religious. I agree that there are many ways to sooth one's spirit and motivate creativity. However, it cannot be denied that religions play a vital role on many occasions. It may be a delusion, but in this case it is a delusion for a good cause. However, most of the time the god delusion has a negative effect on humanity, including war, tyranny, bureaucracy, superstition, terrorism, and many more evil deeds. Of all the religious activities, I only admire the religious self-help groups, fellowship groups and self-improvement programmes which help people help themselves and each others. If there is a chance for people to really live a better live, it does not really matter whether it is god delusion or not.    [...]
B000YDOOUK|5.0|I've seen lots of live shows, something close to 250 bands.  Some of the best were Pantera, White Zombie, Kyuss, Quicksand...  I recently saw Airbourne play live.  I have the CD and there is no mistaking that they are straight ahead bar room brawling Aussie pub rock.  Every song is high energy, hook laden, all built around shout out loud choruses.  This is rock in roll for good times, nothing more and nothing less.  BUT, seeing these guys live is a sight to behold.  I have never witnessed the balls out energy that they delivered for a straight 50 minutes.  At one point I felt a G-force kick in due to the break neck intensity they created.  Granted, some of the songs sound a bit similar to one another, but it didn't matter when you could see the look in the guys eyes when they were bringing the house down.  No joke, when these Aussie rockers made eye contact, there was a touch of lunacy there that made one wonder if they would slip off the rails as they ripped into each of their rock anthems.  This was one of the best live shows I have ever seen!  No lies here, Airbourne is an amazing live band, so don't miss them!

B00004WG2F|5.0|If you don't like this movie, it probably means you think too much.  Get your head out of those books, geek!
B00004Y87O|2.0|The movie held my interest, despite a crazy premise: the answer to out of control crime in the futuristic USA is to contain it in a big city surrounded by water and mines and whatever other disincentive to split. Why Washington, D.C. would choose the financial capital for the experiment is beyond any second-rate science fiction writer and should have been beyond Mr. Carpenter.<br />So we have the worm-laden Big Apple denizen Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell), a War hero, whom the viewer is left to surmise, became a civilian criminal not long after his patriotic exploits. Anyway, the Police Chief enlists Snake to rescue the President, who has crash landed inside the prison-city and has become a prisoner himself. The viewer is never sure how much sympathy to lend to Snake because the details of his lawlessness are not brought out.<br />Instead of appealing to his good sense and inate Patriotism, they implant him with an explosive to be detonated if he doesn't accomplish his mission in due time. Interesting logic.<br />Along the way, he encounters the Brain and his girlfriend, none other than Adrienne Barbeau, who doesn't have alot to do, in fact, seems disintetested in the Brain, who doesn't exactly display the machismo of the Snake. She does come through in the end as a cool kitty wielding a weapon which advances the plot; she's every bit as cool as the cool cat Snake (just to mix metaphors for fun).<br />There's some \\"New York\\" left to New York, at least in one shot of what appears to be Central Park, though the production looks very cardboard. Bizarre lighting effects to create a composite of the Roman Colisseum in ruins and Broadway in decay.<br />Probably the best acting comes from the *musician* Isaac Hayes, who plays the unofficial inmate representative, the Duke; some of the best over-acting comes from the always dependable Ernest Borgnine, who drives a mean taxi-cab. Barbeau under-acts...good choice. I detected no close-ups for her.<br />Ultimately, the story has no useful symbolism, and is quite suspect in it's cynical view of Government. Snake shows no interest in rescuing the President, says \\"get another President\\", then reluctantly agrees to save him. When Donald Pleasence delivers his reassuring speech to the Nation following the rescue, Snake walks away in disgust.<br />Russell was two years away from a silly bio.-pic. on his childhood idol, Elvis Presley, and even incorporates some of that style here and there. But it's like when Elvis played a prize fighter and looked about 100 bench presses away from believability. Barbeau as the Brain's \\"Squeeze\\", didn't even look twice., and is quite suspect in it's cynical view of Government.

B0014Z4OQG|5.0|When reviewing Cloverfield obvious comparisons to movies like [[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]] are easy to make, but this film is so much more then a simple monster bash. Cloverfield is a wild mix of Godzilla like monster fun, blended with The Blair Witch Project camera style and Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition) like suspense all blended together to make one of the most perfect monster/disaster/horror films of the modern day.<br /><br />First off lets give some credit to the incredible job the producers did marketing this film. For all the months leading up to its release potential viewer's searched the internet for clews as to what this film may be about, all to no avail. No movie I've ever seen has been surrounded by so much mystery. What is it really about? Is it a giant monster? Aliens? Government tests? What? You really have to see it (or read reviews on Amazon) to find out.<br /><br />The movie is shot completely, from beginning to end, on a hand held digital camera that different characters take turns filming with throughout the course of the movie, very much like Blair Witch Project. Although this can take some getting used to, and yes it did make me extremely dizzy and disoriented, the artistic benefits from filming a movie in this way are obvious from the beginning. Viewers are able to see enough of the action and disaster to satisfy the biggest action junky, yet enough is left unexplained that the movie doesn't at any time seem fake or scripted. You are able to see the entire story as it unfolds though the eyes of a very small group of people which allows you to identify and ultimately sympathize with them. As well as giving the movie a more personal effect, the home camera gives this movie a very post 9/11 feel. We've all seen the shots of the WTC falling in NYC and people running for their lives as the dust from the towers quickly moves down the street engulfing everything in its path. Watching the Empire State Building fall to pieces before your very eyes will bring back memories of those fateful days in 2001 when our lives changed forever. The camera style also gives this movie a very Jaws like effect. The director of this film was able to show just enough of the monster to satisfy his audience, yet also hide it enough so that by the end you still aren't quite sure what it was or what it looked like. Although there are some shots where the monster thing is in full view and staring right at the camera, it is still hard to see because the camera is of such \\"poor\\" quality and doesn't allow you to see much. The monster is hidden in full view, a brilliant way of building suspense that is as scary as it is original (at least in the giant monster genera).<br /><br />Despite the very blatant references to 9/11 it is very refreshing to see a film that is brave enough to re-create that fateful day yet stay neutral on any political commentary. Cloverfield does not exist to pass judgment on anyone, or to give its own opinions or views on 9/11, instead it tries, and succeeds in my opinion, in showing how the events took place from the eyes of those who witness it. The movie focuses on the disaster itself, separating itself from all the political commentary and conspiracy theories that followed, and for that I give it major props for that.<br /><br />Although the movie steers clear of a lot of political commentary, it does not hesitate to give us a generous helping of social commentary. What does everyone do when the see the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the street? They take pictures on their camera phones of course, and then they huddle around the video camera to get a glimpse of what it was that just invaded their city. What do people do when the cops and military are preoccupied with fighting off the giant monster? They loot electronic stores and steal TV's and radios, a clear reference to the chaos that followed disaster in New Orleans and to a lesser extent Baghdad after the US invasion. People watch spongbob squarpants along with news footage of the destruction of Manhattan. Its the little things like this that are what sets Cloverfield above Godzilla and King Kong (Widescreen Edition) (as much as I love Peter Jackson) and makes it something memorable and special.<br /><br />But this movie doesn't get bogged down in its social commentary and 9/11 references. in its heart of hearts Cloverfield, for all its artistic filming style and commentary, really just wants to be an action/horror movie. From the second the monster shows up in the city to the very end every minute is filled with gun battles, fighter jets flying overhead unleashing their rockets into the city, and old fashioned giant monster destroying the city fun. This is what Godzilla should have been, instead of being a Hollywood style movie, shot in a very unoriginal and cheesy style with an unimaginative script and plot, Cloverfield manages to give action on a monumental scale yet show its audience relatively little of what is actually going on. The scares in this movie resemble those found in movies like 28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition). There is a scene about halfway though the movie that takes place in an underground tunnel in almost complete darkness with all the light coming from a few dim lights in the ceiling and a night vision scope on the camera, reminiscent of similar scenes in last years sequel to 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition). This movie does not rely on cheap scares that any idiot can do, instead it slowly builds up tension and manages to keep its audience tense and scared throughout its entire running time.<br /><br />Believe the hype people, this movie not only lives up to the mystery and excitement of its trailers but surpasses them. This movie has all the potential to become the next great cult classic and join the ranks of horror greats from history.

0143038419|3.0|A friend highly recommended this book. I LOVED the section on Italy... dreamlife - learn Italian and eat for a few months, yes I will keep that in mind if I ever hit rock bottom and have the money. The India trip didn't quite connect with me. Richard from Texas made that part worth reading. And the Bali trip was interesting from a cultural perspective, but by this stage I was seriously wondering what in the world she was doing by now.   This author can describe feelings in such a vivid manner I have a hard time believing. Initially it makes for a good read, then it becomes a little over the top. It was a different type book from the usual murder mysteries I read so I still enjoyed it.

B0011NVC98|4.0|Great movie! Don't go into this expecting scene for scene, word for word to be the original literature piece translation. It's different in a few key parts, but for a movie rendition of this tale, it works wonderfully.    If you like action/adventure, awesome CG animation, and lots of violence, Beowulf is the movie for you.
B000QEIOTO|5.0|Pretty simple. Excellent story, excellent actors (first I thought damon would be to tiny to fit but i had to admit that he fits the role pretty well), extremely well filmed. The sequels gets better (wich is rare enough to be stressed!).    HD DVD quality is excellent and allows u to rediscover the movie, specially the audio which is very good. Video is a bit under but only because the movie is past over ten years now!!    A must have
B000EGEVZK|5.0|I will make this quick and simple.  I came home one day to see that mail carrier not done his/her job properly and upon finding me not at home for the delivery simply left my package in the hallway of my apartment, under my door.  As I entered my lobby I found my package opened and empty.  Canada Post ignored my inquiry but Amazon.com replied right away and sent me another one free of charge.  Zip ahead a couple of weeks and the DVD set arrived.  Once again left by the postal carrier outside my apartment door, but this time I came across it first instead of a thief.  Doesn't say much for the delivery people at Canada post (after all the post office is just two blocks from my apartment, it's not a hardship for them to leave it there like they are supposed to for me to pick up).  It does say a lot about amazon.com and how great they treat their customers.    Now to the DVD set itself.  It's great.  There is plenty of rare stuff on these discs, and it was so interesting that I managed to sit through the whole thing in one go.  I highly recommend this DVD set.  Just not for the thief who stole the first one delivered to my door!
B000MXPE88|4.0|First I thought the good sheperd would be some kind of \\"JFK\\" film....but the story (ie creation of the CIA) is far most unknown but still very interisting.     As for the hd dvd, audio is excellent but doesn't have the opportunity to unchain as the movie run smoothly the all time...  Picture is perfect even in dark sequences with extreme dark blacks.    Enjoyable
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Overall, a good version. However, the scene in Bath at the end when Anne and Capt. Wentworth acknowledge their love for each other is poorly done. It's not the actors, but the camera angle. Still worth the price for Austen fans.
B00000JGHS|3.0|It's really unfortunate that most people know this brilliant story only as a mediocre film.  The story was adapted from an absolutely delightful novel written by Carl Hiassen of the Miami Herald.  Having read Strip Tease before seeing the movie, I enjoyed Striptease a lot more than most viewers.  I can understand how people would think the movie missed the mark if judged only by the movie.    Burt Reynolds plays Congressman Dilbeck almost exactly as he's portrayed in the book and he does a fantastic job in the role.  Ving Rhames does a great job playing the bouncer, Shad, at the Eager Beaver.  Unfortunately, the screenwriters' adapted screenplay attempts to make the Erin Grant role a bit more serious than she was in the book and, quite honestly, a more significant character than she was.  Given that \\"Strip Tease\\" the novel was a dark comedy, having any character delve into the seriously dramatic was not really something I feel Hiassen intended.    Whether talking about the book or the film, do note that this story isn't a sex-fest.  While the story does have a great number of scenes where the strip club is the setting, it's really done in such a way that it's not at all distasteful.  I think that while some of the scenes where Erin was dancing were dragged on for the moviegoers who were just there to see Demi nude, the filmmakers did a commendable job keeping it from becoming entirely about sex and I give them credit for that.  The story could have been slanted an entirely different direction with this kind of story.    For the real story, read the book and you'll enjoy.  The movie makes a lot more sense when you've read the book.  I own the movie and the book and enjoy both.
B000Z27HLS|2.0|I don't think this version was as good as the version with Peter Firth playing Mr. Tilney. There wasn't a lot of chemistry between the main characters.
B000SNUMC0|2.0|I cant believe the rave reviews this album is getting-   I am a LONG TIME Iced Earth fan, 12+ years, in fact my first album was Burnt Offerings (one of their best ever), so thats why it is hard to say this, but..    This album is not one of their best. Why?  All of the songs are really forgettable and average. Nothing stands out. None of the riffs stand out. It doesnt have any \\"wow\\" moments, it just kind of drones on and on and on. The production value is excellent, and its a cool concept - but the songs no way near deserve the accolades they are getting.  The songs just never ... take off, they never really go anywhere they just sorta ramble.    I cant believe it is getting 4.5/5 star reviews. It doesnt even remotely compare to Dark Saga, Burnt Offerings and Stormrider.  Just my .02
B000W07EKW|5.0|I have seen a lot of spy films.  For suspense, mystery, complexity that the viewer must unravel, and that strange quality that allows you to suspend your disbelief, this is undoubtedly the best trilogy of spydom I have ever seen.<br /><br />You start with Bourne waking with amnesia, struggling to remember who he is, but with his calculating mind and deadly skills wired into his DNA.  He is in danger and meets a wonderful girl, who is kind of a lost soul with great potential, that life force that one finds in sudden, true love.  She becomes his guide to the search for - or effort to reconstruct - his personality.<br /><br />Due to politics and a murderous bureaucracy, Bourne functioned as a kind of ultimate assassin.  (\\"I don't send you to kill...I send you to be invisible because you don't exist.\\")  Over the course of 3 films, we learn details of what he was made to be, and how.  At the end, we see that he hated what he had become, which in combination with his \\"conditioning\\", was the source of his amnesia.  It was psychological - wanting to find his earlier identity, which was taken from him in spite of his protests - as much as physical.<br /><br />His new life, of course, is tragic.  This makes it psychologically real, combined with the greatest acting that I have ever been found in a spy series.  In my view, Damon is one of the greatest actors alive, and he gives life to this role in a way I have never seen in a spy film.  The most interesting things is that each film in the series adds to the others, deepening the themes while offering heart-pounding suspense and sufficient realism and detail to enter the imagination.  Yet not everything is explained, so that many of the biggest conclusions lie under the surface.<br /><br />If I could give this series 6 stars I would.  I have watched each film numerous times and am never disappointed - it just gets richer.  This is one of the rare films that transcends the book.

0385338724|5.0|I must say that I'm a big fan of most of Sophie Kinsella's books - and this one is no exception. While I wondered if the plot (Lexi Smart, the main character, has amnesia) could really be entertaining enough to carry me through the entire book, I'm happy to say that it did!  Sophie Kinsella did a fantastic job with her character development - once again I feel like Lexi and her friends could be my friends because I know them so well now. I am, however, quite sad... because the book is over!
0385474547|4.0|Part I is amazing. After that, I think the book is a little bit dated, but still worth reading.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This really sucks!  I got both the first and second seasons of Supernatural brand new.  I loved them, I got into the second season and my freaking DVD player wrecked dics 2, 4, and 6.  I am really pissed about that!  Other than that, I could not be happier with amazons quality and speedy delivery.
B0007P0LPC|4.0|You will never have the opportunity to see again such an extraordinary ballet, danced by these two \\"monster\\" of dancing.

0743298039|5.0|It's been a long time since I read a novel where I felt the like the author really got me.     \\"Got you?\\" You ask. \\"The author can't get you. They never even met you.\\"    But you see, this author has more than met me. She is me in some ways. The reader who is more likely to have a book as a best friend than a person-and is ok with that. Not a loner, not a geek, but someone who appreciates the written word, who loves stories, who is constantly reading searching for something special.    I'm happy to report I have found another special book. It's not something I expected to find so appealing. A little novel that's more about storytelling than anything else, lacking the historical detail I love to absorb-and it's in first person. But it's hard to resist a story that is told by one of your own kind- a story seeker, a story teller-and it's impossible to resist \\"The Thirteenth Tale.\\"    Imagine an old woman-the most famous, prolific author in the UK about whom almost nothing is known-who one day sends a letter to a young woman working in her family bookshop. She's not famous, she's never written a novel, doesn't even read contemporary novels. But based on a short biographical piece on two brothers she published the old woman wants her to write her biography before she dies.    And this time, the old woman, renowned for her fantastic, unbelievable (and unverifiable) life stories, is going to tell the truth.    Like I said, this novel is literally irresistible. It is chopped full of secrets on top of secrets, stories that twist and turn and lead you to unexpected places. I never, in a million years could have guessed at the ending for the book. It is a shocker then looking back, fits in perfectly with the story. And the writing is unbelievable. Funny, touching, stuffed with real meaning and heart wrenching sense that will make you laugh, cry, dance around the room.    It's a special book all right. I recommend it very highly. And I can't wait for more from this author.Diane Setterfield as a fellow book lover I salute you and your wonderful achievement.     Five stars.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride & Prejudice has long been a favorite of mine, and this production is a stand-out. Colin Firth is fantastic, and sexy as can be. A great purchase.
0312360266|3.0|Being 16 and the probable target market (though not being inclusive), I felt while the plot was interesting and throughly enjoyable, the characters seemed rather shallow. By the end, I felt the urge to strangle the lead, Zoey, who I personally did not connect to in any aspect and believed most of her 'friends', who she didn't seem to like very much, were awfully sterotypical. But, as I have said, the plot *was* very interesting, and I probably will read the sequals.
B00005JPTK|3.0|This was a great film.  Intriguing.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  This is one of those movies that really sticks with you.    Don't! however, buy the two disc special edition.  All you get on the second disc is the whole movie with an alternate ending.  What a disappointment.  The alternate ending was okay but not worth paying for.  I was expecting behind the scenes, the \\"making of...\\", that sort of thing.  Not so much.    Save a few bucks and buy the single disc version.
B00003CWPL|4.0|I was proud of myself for enduring this ordeal all the way to the end. I have always said that all prospective parents should be made to see this film.
B000UD0ESA|4.0|Who doesn't love this movie?  It is phenomenal; I don't need to tell you that.  I loved the extensive making of and all the interesting facts and the trials behind making the film.    Worth the bucks.
B0015QT78O|5.0|This show was aired at the wrong time. It would have been the \\"Touched by an Angel\\" of its time period if people had watched it. It was of the same ilk as the original Jeff Bridges movie, but also of Michael Landon's Highway to Heaven, The Incredible Hulk (and other pursuit shows).
B000K4WPCC|4.0|I love movies that have supernatural themes and this one wasn't too bad.  What it lacked in overall plot/depth and questionable acting from some of the cast, it made up for with hot, buff guys running around fighting each other. I look forward to seeing Steven Strait in other movies, he defitantely has potential.
B000YRY8BG|4.0|Well written, superbly cast, well acted, good ending -- a thinking Brit's thriller with newspaper reporters and editors as the heroes.
B00104W8T6|5.0|If you loved the movie, this will bring it all back.  Yes, many of the tracks are simplistic, and that is their charm.  Very much captures the 'feel good' spirit of the movie.  Also provides you an introduction to some indie music that you might not have heard otherwise.
B000B8QG22|5.0|We don't need to go to church to get the golden rule--watch this movie and it will be etched in your soul.  Robin Williams is brilliant.  This is a film that should be seen by everyone--should be required viewing in schools.  How do we see our military?  Are they human beings?  Cranauer thinks so.  He also thinks the native Vietnamese and the Viet Cong are human beings.  Straight up philosophy.  Cranauer has the audacity to tell it like it is from his first words broadcasted over the raido, \\"Good morning, Vietnam!\\"  Make it part of your DVD-brary.
B000WC3AGM|4.0|If you are a fan of this movie I would recomend this set.  The only thing that was a little disappointing was you don't get to choose the color of the locker and unfortuantly during shipment my locker got a little damaged.  It was packed well and is quite heavy when you receive it but my locker shelf must of came loose at some point during the shipping ans scratched up the inside of the locker.  But overall the features are worth it.
080701429X|4.0|i am glad that I read this book. It made me think about life in general.  I am glad that this is out there for people like me who did not live through that era. Great reference book for applications of Psychology.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|I am a huge fan of Genesis and was lucky enough to see them on one of there earlier tours.  I own several of there Cd's and his is one of my faves.  The sound quality is terrific and they sound as good as ever.  What I like most about this Live CD is the amount of older songs that they included on this tour CD.  It was exactly the right balance of material and I really enjoyed it and wished I saw this tour..
B000WCBPOG|5.0|truth be told, I think this is even better than the original. While I appreciate their song writing talents, I've never really gotten into the Beatles vocally. But I love the vocals on here. And just for the record, I'm 51 so I'm not speaking as one who didn't grow up with them.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|I remember it well. Walking into the movie theater in summer of 1999 with friends and being so excited about seeing a little indie movie called [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]]. When I had seen the trailer I thought how cool the concept was: to show a movie from a video camcorder perspective (so we're there with the frightened documenters). Well, that was the only cool thing about that movie. The story, character development and direction were the worst thing I had ever seen. I remember the movie ending and feeling cheated as well as if I had just lost 86 minutes of my life I could have been seeing something much better. \\"Blair Witch\\" was also a joke to me because I had been camping in those same woods (in Burkittsville, MD) as a younger kid and there definitely was no spirit or ghost or killer there. And then the one good thing that came out of the \\"Blair Witch\\" movie faded back into obscurity: the cool idea that a movie be shot from a character's perspective a la typical video camcorder.<br /><br />Then came J.J. Abrams (creator and producer genius of shows like \\"Felicity,\\" \\"Alias,\\" and \\"Lost\\"). While visiting in Japan promoting his movie directorial debut \\"Mission: Impossible III,\\" with his son, he saw Godzilla toys and thought that America should have its own version of the infamous radiated lizard. He contacted his crew at his production company Bad Robot. They in turn hired writer extraordinare Drew Goddard (who's written TV episodes of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" \\"Angel,\\" and \\"Alias\\") and director Matt Reeves (who's only directed the David Schwimmer sleeper \\"The Pallbearer\\" and a few episodes of \\"Felicity,\\" which he co-created with Abrams). I knew with Reeves, Goddard and Abrams involved that they would bring to their latest project -- entitled \\"Cloverfield\\" (named after the street near Abrams' office) or \\"01-18-08\\" (the movie didn't have an official title; even when the teaser trailer was shown before \\"Transformers\\") -- what was sorely missing in \\"Blair Witch.\\" They were going to emotionally invest in the characters and have the audience feel close to the main characters with screen time.<br /><br />Like most trends, they hired a cast of unknowns or up-and-comers that hardly anyone has heard of: Lizzy Caplan ([[ASIN:B0002IQJ8W Mean Girls]]), Mike Vogel (2003's [[ASIN:B00018D44K The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]), Jessica Lucas (ABC's cancelled [[ASIN:B0009F43DG Life As We Know It]]), Odette Yustman (ABC's [[ASIN:B000U1ZV2G October Road]]), the wonderful new comedian T.J. Miller (ABC's \\"Carpoolers\\"), and excellent leading man Michael Stahl-David (NBC's cancelled [[ASIN:B000S8CLR4 The Black Donnellys]]). The producers and writers did well with imbuing this film with palpable characters who remind us of ourselves and people we know. Each character in this movie has their own story (and relationship) which is introduced creatively well in the beginning by recordings (thanks to Miller's everyman character Hud) of each character's interaction at a going-away party for Rob (Stahl-David). Also, interspersed throughout the tape -- when the current party/disaster recording is turned off -- the audience sees previously recorded footage of Rob and his love interest Beth (Yustman) on a special day together. Just when you think the movie is going to continue with these relationships, then all hell unexpectedly breaks loose.<br /><br />The brilliance of this movie is its \\"Blair Witch concept\\" of showing the film as if it were merely found film footage (no credits at the beginning, only in the end). Of course, this film is on a much bigger scale than \\"Blair Witch,\\" with a monster terrorizing Manhattan. And while that seems unrealistic, it's the only unrealistic thing about this movie. What the characters do and say, the way the movie plays out is completely realistic. Unlike \\"Blair Witch,\\" even when there are no attacks or action sequences, \\"Cloverfield\\" keeps your eyes peeled to the screen; out of the entire packed audience Isaw this film with, no one said a word, cracked a joke or even got up to go the bathroom. This movie is everything a disaster movie should be! A thrilling ride of adrenaline and a heart-wrenching story of survival and human emotion, \\"Cloverfield\\" strikes all the right chords from fright to bravery to even humor. It shows the horror of the event from the point of view of the common man on the ground who's merely trying to survive the catastrophe. Like [[ASIN:B0008KLVG4 Jaws]] (with the shark, throughout most of the movie) and the original theatrical release of [[ASIN:B000FQJAJG The Empire Strikes Back]] (with the Wampa in the ice cave), where the \\"monsters\\" are not seen for a long time during their screen time, this movie uses that same approach of not showing the monster in its entirety or at all. And that works extremely well for building up the terror for the audience. I won't tell you what the monster looks like when you finally do see it, but I will say it looks nothing like [[ASIN:B000FA4TLQ Godzilla]] or any interpretation of it. Of course, there also has to be another monstrous threat and it comes in the form of what I can only imagine are the equivalent of \\"fleas\\" for the monster, but are our size and have very big jaws and teeth. When these monsters are introduced to the lead characters (and thus to the audience), it matches the same terrifying, pulse-pounding moment in [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]] when Bill Paxton's character holds up the alien locater and sees that the aliens have completely surrounded them in the tunnel and are soon going to attack.<br /><br />\\"Cloverfield\\" was a wonderful monster/catastrophe film and I could easily see it at least three more times in the theater ... if not more. Kudos to Abrams, Reeves, Goddard and crew who pulled off a groundbreaking new form of cinema that the folks attached to \\"Blair Witch\\" tried desperately to achieve, but painfully failed. The detail that went into the effects as well as the camerawork (some done by actor Miller himself) was so flawlessly executed that I felt as if I were immersed in watching an actual documetary. I'm sure plenty of knock-off straight-to-DVD movies will soon be surfacing with Cloverfield's success, but none will even come close. Everything works with \\"Cloverfield\\": the story, the acting, the character development, and the direction. If this seems like the kind of movie you're in to but still aren't sure about it, go see it without hesitation! I'm sure there won't be another like it that's this good in a very long time. I've never been so wowed by a movie of this genre and can't recommend it enough. SEE IT! However, there is one caution I must tell you: You'll leave the theater wanting more. More information about the characters, more follow-up, more movie (director Reeves even hinted at looking closely at the background at the very end of the movie for something in the Coney Island scene and staying until the very end of the credits for a voice clip from a radio transmission)! This movie is phenomenal! Like me, most viewers will want to see \\"Cloverfield\\" over and over again. And that's a true mark of any film's success.<br /><br />And for those skeptical that this DVD release will be what studios did for the DVD release of \\"Zodiac\\" and other blockbusters in the past -- releasing a regular version with no special features one month, then only to re-release a DVD loaded with special features 6-7 months later (this is referred to as \\"double-dipping\\") -- the special features for the upcoming DVD release of \\"Cloverfield\\" have been revealed by Paramount Pictures Home Entertainment as of March 18. Now let's just hope they go with some better, more cooler packaging than the stupid poster art; something that fits the style of the movie (I want a \\"top secret\\" government slip case and package to make it look like it's an actual piece of government evidence). Here are the special features:<br /><br />* Commentary: Commentary by Director Matt Reeves<br />*Featurette: The Making of Cloverfield<br />* Featurette: Cloverfield Visual Effects<br />* Featurette: I Saw It!

B0014BQQYS|5.0|Long one of my favorite westerns and, in fact, one of my favorite films of all time, most especially from the era that spanned the late 1960s through the 70s and into the early 80s, a period that was one of the golden ages of American cinema. I happened across a brief portion of this film on hi-def cable a few months ago, and it looked great. I definitely look forward to this Blu-ray release.
0525950079|5.0|This book,the sequel to The Pillars Of The Earth, makes you feel as if you are actually there in the 13th century of England.  I soaked up all 1014 pages of it and grew to love of hate, as each deserved, the monks, bishops, knights, earls, peasants, merchants, baliffs, sheriffs, priests, nums and masons.  I usually read a couple of books a week, this one took me a whole week because of its length and the fact I relished every word of it.  Bravo, Mr. Follett.    Ted M. Dunagan  Author of A Yellow Watermelon
0671449028|5.0|There is something about this book that has stuck with me for years. I'm almost 30 years old, and still the words \\"to take a bath in one big tub with soap all over-scrub, scrub, scrub!\\" are as clear to me as they were when I was about five years old. This is just a wonderfully simple and fun book that I imagine most kids would want to read every single night before bedtime like I did. Clearly the benefits of storybook time with kids works considering how well I still remember lines from this! I highly recommend!
B000002JAX|5.0|Vocal jazz the way it should be  - silky, other worldly, transports you to one of your favorite places with people whom you want to be with.
B0000DBJDM|3.0|Frankly I'm a tad disappointed. I still love the film but feel that the Pink Floyd \\"mystique\\" was better captured and portrayed in the original release (which I have on VHS). The out-takes that have been put in detract from that mystique and make this seem a bit more of a joke. The visuals of celestial bodies and outer space don't add much eaither. Perhaps if I were not jaded by knowledge of the original I would be gushing about this the director's cut. Still, the film captures a time when there were plenty of new barriers to be broken and a new age seemed to be dawning. It's textures remind me of Nicholas Roege's \\"Walkabout\\"--filmed in the early 70's too when lenses, light and spetral seperation thereof WAS the extent of \\"special effects\\". I was lucky enough to see Pink Floyd in concert at Carnegie Hall in NYC soon after this film was shot and they really had an aura of other-worldliness. I think this film portays that and is worth having (even with the warts added in the director's cut).
0452289963|5.0|This is a must read for every human being that is ready for a change in the way we interact as an individual in society.
0143038419|2.0|I was very excited to read this book as I too am currently living abroad and learning a language. But I got seriously tired of the author's slam on Republicans. At one point she quotes her sister's biggest fear about her second baby as \\"my only fear is it grows up to be a republican\\". This is after other jabs at an america that does war for fun and other republican slamming. I wonder if she would have quoted her sister in the book if her sister's biggest fear had been \\"my biggest fear is that my baby grows up to be gay\\". As a woman, and a pragmatist and a Republican, I resent this author's bigotry. When will New Yorkers realize that half their country is Republican? I get tired of their political arrogance. For this reason I have not been able to enjoy the book as much as I might have if she had made an attempt to keep her politics to herself. And most unfortunately, I will not recommend it to others (the same as if she'd had a bigotry against gays, since I wouldn't know which way my friends might feel about these issues).
B00000G3AZ|4.0|I actually think this Austen adaptation is a delight. It adheres to the book well enough (it's only 2 hours after all). It's certainly faithful to the sensibility of the book. I think it's very well cast. There's genuine chemistry between Paltrow and Northam, which is important and something that's too often neglected in casting Austen films. Toni Colette and Alan Cummings are fun to watch. It's bright, refreshing, funny, and romantic. Enjoy!
B000002GOZ|4.0|I'm a big Bryan Adams fan, but this is the first time I've bought his music. None of the songs I knew were on this CD, but I like just about everything.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Quintin Tarintino cheated. He was supposed to make a b movie and he accidentally made a great one. Great car chase, great dialogue, great acting, not exactly what a b movie entails.
B00133KFGW|4.0|I really liked a lot about this picture - the music is lovely, and I  enjoyed the way that the soundtrack sort of put you inside our young hero's head - you can start to hear the music in a siren or a windchime or a pair of feet walking on wet pavement.  I also really enjoyed the fact that this film's universe isn't violent or cruel.  What a relief after the mean and vicious characters we've had to pay money to watch in other pictures this past season!  And I really like young Freddie Highmore.  It's good to see him in a picture where he's able to shine on center stage.     As to the plot, the similarities to \\"Oliver Twist\\" are too many to go un-noticed.  A young street musician plays the role of the Artful Dodger, bringing Our Hero back to an abandoned theater swarming with orphaned street kids.  The gang is headed up by a slimey, Fagin-esque Robin Williams, to whom the kids give the money they earn as street buskers.  Instead of a sympathetic magistrate, we have sympathetic social worker and a sympathetic minister of the gospel.    As in the Dickens novel, our young hero gets a taste of the good life at the Julliard School of Music, but Fagin (oops, Williams as \\"The Wizard\\") is tipped off by the Dodger, and drags our hero back into the street life.  Everything works out in a happy ending, though, and Oliver (oops, August) is happily re-united with his family.    I guess what keeps this from being 5 stars for me is just the blatantness of the story-lifting, and the predictability of it from that point of view.  I really did enjoy the picture, though, and I think it's a wonderful break from the \\"gritty\\" messes we're so often served up.
B000FBGBPC|4.0|It had been 4 years between albums and I for one was giving up on this band releasing another album thinking this was another one CD band. Then in 2006 they released their sophomore album - One X - and two things were instantly apparent - 1. With the time away, they had polished off the sound theu wanted to be unique with their band 2. The Time away had benefited them, rejuvenated the whole group.<br /><br />Three Days Grace are now an adult band, having grown up from those awkward lanky teens with mainstream rock music. In this album they have ventured into hard rock and at times nu-metal beats. A number of songs are noteworthy in this respect 'Pain' and 'Animal I Have Become' that uses hard beats with deep grooving vocals. On the other hand there are a few songs that still retain the rock theme but are softer and more melodic, 'Never Too Late'.<br /><br />This late 2006 release is a big step forward for Three Days Grace and the deep bass sounds and solid guitar riffs set this band apart from all other hard rock artists.
0783240236|5.0|I've loved this film since I was a kid and still do. My only complaint is for the physical DVD itself, I wish they would've worked harder to clear up some of the grainy static...i.e. remastered version. Otherwise it's Classic Hitchcock!
B00006FDCD|4.0|I can't even tell you how many times I've turned on the TV and found this movie on... I'd probably seen it ten times, but only once from beggining to end... and I still loved it each time I saw IT.  I give it four stars though, just because the monster at the end is pretty lame... but hey, TV budget.  Who cares?  IT is still the shh IT.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|This is one of the best SciFi movies I have ever seen! If you liked 2001: A Space Odyssey then this is a film you can not miss. All aspects of this movie are grat from the acting to the visual effects. The story keeps you hooked from begining to end.
B00005QK5X|4.0|The Wipers had some really great tunes and were fronted by Greg Sage, a supremely prolifict song-writer who would often go against the grain of style present in the American underground of the late seventies and eighties.  Long songs, solos, melody... Still, a lot of us would come to recognize the Wipers as cult heroes and their albums classics.  If you're young, or from the east, then you've probably onyl heard the Wipers via Cobain's gushing in the early ninties and Nirvana's covers. Be sure to check out the source.<br /><br />My favorite song, bar none, is \\"Mystery.\\"  The song comes off the \\"Is This Real\\" album.  There's also a demo version, which, to be honest, I prefer.  You really get your money here; the first three albums plus the amount of songs availible to us back in the eighties is doubled for you here with the inclusion of unheard demos, live songs, and alternate versions.  A valuable, inspiring, collection.
B000068IEU|1.0|Why make movies like this?  It serves no purpose whatsoever.  While other horror flicks have some wisdom to impart, if only the partial wisdom that there is real evil in this world, this one has absolutely no merit whatsoever.  If one was to infer anything from it, it is that the producers are vile.  It seems that audiences enjoy horrible themes because they don't have horror in their own lives: obviously, the distance from the horrible fate of others is a sense of consolation that is mistaken by the viewer as entertainment.  Others seem to concede it and embrace it with some dark pleasure.  It is only wise counsel that notes all life is destined to death and the second side of the coin: what are people going to do about it?  I thank God for Jesus Christ who will resurrect the faithful to new life with incorruptible bodies and the termination of any power of death over such lives.  I know of no hospital that can make those guarantees.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Another great adaptation of Jane Austen work; cast is excellent.  I had been looking for this one for a while, too.  :)
B00007KWHN|5.0|This is the album when \\"Yes became Yes\\".  I usually don't like those comparisons, but this is one of Yes's best albums, and it was a real commercial breakthrough.  It only has 6 tracks (at least on the original version), but they are 6 great tracks.  It also has 4 of Yes's signature songs, Yours is No Disgrace, Starship Trooper, Your Move/All Good People, and Perpetual Change.  The songwriting is top notch, and the interplay between the musicians (and the beautiful vocals) is really awesome.  Many have said this is the quinessential Yes album (no pun intended), but many forget that Rick Wakeman wasn't on this album.  Tony Kaye, the original keyboardist, was here and his keyboards blend in perfectly with the band.  He isn't as techinically accomplished as Wakeman is/was, but his playing fit the group quite well.  Sometimes I think Rick Wakeman, awesome keyboardist he is, didn't like being in a band situation.  Keith Emerson, Wakeman's only real rival in the prog rock movement, was able to show off his chops a lot more in ELP than Wakeman ever did in Yes.  But then Emerson, Lake, and Palmer was a power trio with Emerson the main focus, not a 5 piece band where the musical \\"burden\\" was shared more.  I think Kaye doesn't get credit for shaping Yes's music more.<br /><br />This is one of favorite Yes albums, incredibly complex, tuneful, and wonderful.  It's extremely memorable, and the remastering job here is exemplary.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|this was a great item for the price i paid and it was a great price LOL
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Serenity was one of the most enjoyable science fiction movie aired recently. However the storyline in not too complex, nevertheless better than the storylines of the new star wars trilogy or star trek nemesis. After seeing Serenity and the Firefly series I realized why these became cultic. Know I try to specify a few values of Serenity. The camera navigation is very fine grained and fortunately not \\"shaky\\". The illumination effects of the scenes are very aesthetic, too.  I very liked the smooth presentations of the futuristic cities. The space battles are thrilling and artistic; I think those screens are breathtakingly realistic. So the CGI is excellent, of course this is a subjective opinion. The cast was excellent, but the storyline sometimes seems to be too dramatic. I personally very liked River's character. Summer Glau played very professionally the uncontrollable River who is struggling with her \\"mental problems\\". She plays River as natural as Sigourney Weaver played Ripley in Alien. The fighting sequences were awesome with the subtle choreography. This movie is worth watching not just for the Firefly fans, but for anyone who like science fiction. The director Joss Whedon has a special skill to synthesize different movie styles which is perfectly discernible in the \\"firefly universe\\". In the collector's edition DVD you can find plenty of extra footage and interviews, especially interesting the new construction of the serenity spaceship and Whedon's comments about the struggle for Serenity. Altogether Serenity was one of the best science fiction experiences for me recently. I evaluated this movie as a breakthrough among shallow science fiction films. I was unable to find this DVD edition in my home country, so it has a \\"special value\\" for me.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I am watching through a Samsung LNT46 1080P TV and PS3.  The Final Cut is unbelievable.  The clarity is magnificent to say the least.  For all you Blade Runner Fans, the 2019 LA buildings are perfect.  I'm not one to watch a movie over and over again, but I keep watching this one.   GREAT BUY!
B00005JK8K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The characters were believable without drowning in their own melodrama. The action scenes were graphic but not gratuitous. I would highly recommend it! You can understand how Nicholas Cage's character is inevitably drawn into a relationship. Adam Beach's character was credible and not the least bit stereotyped. I half expected his character to be some Hollywood Native American step and fetch it but that was definitely not the case. He was wonderful and provided an insightful, nuanced performance.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Amazing clarity of sound and a comfortable fit.  This is my second set of MDR series, the first convinced me to stay with the Sony Brand.
B0012YYZYU|4.0|A nice collectible concert for living in the past as the song remains the same. Video transfer quality is ok considering the film is about 35 years old. Audio quality has been greatly improved and makes this title worthwhile for Zeppelin fans. This DVD replaced my VHS copy of the movie. The extras are also ok, nothing to get too excited about. If you are expecting the concert to look as good as modern day 16:9 standard DVD's let alone HD DVD's you will be disappointed. A must have for serious collectors as HD is being discontinued.  I give this release four flaming chilies as it is Led Zeppelin after all.
B000002G23|5.0|You cannot ask for more. Every song, four discs, chronological, and a very nicely designed case and booklet. I just got this and I absolutely love it.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|Is there such a thing as a bad movie made in Italy? Probably, but at least the scenery's usually good. I can't imagine A Good Woman working in a setting like New York or London, but I don't have to. It's set in 1930's Amalfi, the perfect background for a story like this one. Professional mistress Mrs. Erlynne flees to Italy when too many wives are on to her at home. On the ship, she notices a newspaper photo of a young couple, and she knows exactly what her next move should be. The young wife is innocent and naive, and all sorts of innuendo and gossip go flying around Amalfi that season.<br />This is a woman's picture, and Helen Hunt as the adventuress has never looked more beautiful. Her voice, unfortunately, is rather too clipped and less sultry than it need to be, but in the end, she pulls of her role. Scarlett Johanssen is well-suited to her character, and both women turn out to be more than they seem at the end. Beautiful wardrobe, very subtle music, and a fine performance by Tom Wilkinson, as a jaded, expat Brit who has learned a little something about reality and happiness, add to the success of this production.<br />I'm now off to read the Oscar Wilde original.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Not having seen Celine Dion's live show in Las Vegas, I was anxious to get the Blu-ray edition.  Everything's great - the quality of the video and sound.  The real time back stage happenings is incredible and the up-close and personal part with Celine is equally intersting.  Not as good as seeing this show live but the next best thing!
0375424474|4.0|This is, by and large, a good general treatment of a fascinating area. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the development of life, be they new to the area or experienced scientists. It has some real nuggets in it. Neil Shubin knows his stuff and, more importantly, has an abiding love for the science underwriting the hypotheses presented - as well as the beauty within.     Having said this, a few criticisms. Professor Shubin has found picking the \\"sweet spot\\" between general appeal to a lay readership, and adequate presentation of the technical and scientific material, difficult. The book is, ultimately, too broad and light, with the depth of technical detail necessary to flesh out the general overview inadequate.     This is almost universally so with books written by experts whose editors, almost invariably, seem to tell them that for every equation or chemical formula you can expect sales (and broad appeal) to drop dramatically. As a result the writer tends to err on the side of simplistic explanation (rather than simple explanation) or repetitive discourse in the hope that somehow the concepts will infuse themselves into the readers mind with little thinking required. It never works.    This is not a text book, nor should it be. Consequently, any expectation that a highly detailed review of current thinking and evidence should be included is not reasonable. However, as a suggestion the early chapters should perhaps be, in effect, concise and comprehensive primers on geology, molecular biology, evolution, paleontology and comparative anatomy. This would provide the background for the balance of the book - the narrative form Shubin relates (but with a little more detail) and, more importantly, a clearer sequential development of the ideas.     Neil Shubin includes a good bibliography and reference section for further reading which complements the book well. Illustrations are excellent but there need to be many more to support the text.    In spite of my comments above the book is an excellent entry to the area. A revised second edition could be outstanding.
B000002H97|2.0|Metallica was THE thrash metal act to beat back in the 80s, the only band that may have beat them as far as raw talent was fellow bay area thrashers Slayer - but Metallica always held the edge in fans.    But with the 90s came the end of the band's domination. That was marked clearly with the release of \\"The Black Album.\\"    Who doesn't remember the breakneck pace and lyrical genius of Master of Puppets? Or the slower paced, but even more powerful ...And Justice For All? The Black album was a huge leap backwards for the band in songwriting.    Where Puppets and Justice dealt with mature and thought-provoking issues including drug abuse, religion, and injustice, \\"Black\\" has Hetfield on about issues like putting your kids to bed, being a wolf and science and technology. Huh? The only two songs on this entire thing I could listen to without cringing were \\"Sad But True\\" and \\"Holier Than Thou.\\" The latter is the closest we would ever see Metallica come back to their thrash metal roots.    The rest of the album is simply a travesty. Lyrics are laugh-out-loud absurd. The guitar riffs have no real power behind the overpowered bass in them. Drums are too loud and have that annoying echo effect everyone and their mother were so fond of in the 80s. And Kirk mangles every solo because he's standing on a waah pedal.    I can't recommend you steer clear of buying this thing enough. For the sake of music itself, save your money for an older Metallica CD. Or better yet a Slayer one. Metallica was finished long before St. Anger. This is the proof.
1595141715|4.0|This book is original, and the author is gifted in a way that few seem to be these days, especially in the young adult section. He's not just a writer - he's a storyteller. This is perfectly written book, and I don't say that very often. Recommended for both the average reader and for people that aspire to be writers themselves. Sometimes extremely painful, this book is craftily written, with seperate storylines weaving in and out of each other in a complicated but precisely thought out manner. A fresh, indvidual voice. I read it in less than 24 hours, and will admit, you find yourself sitting down for only a moment and realize fifty pages have flown by. It's so much better than most books out there right now, and I'd recommend it to anyone.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Celtic Woman _ A New Journey: at Slane Castle, Ireland    I have watched this DVD numerous times.  The excitement of the whole performance was restful and at the same time invigorating.  The singers and violinist were wonderful.  I intent to purchase more selections from these terrific performers and the orchestra backing them.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|This film version of the Matheson novel is so predictable that it caused me to give up on viewing the DVD after only the first 30 minutes. Will Smith is totally unconvincing. BORING!!! Maybe I was spoiled by the Vincent Price vehicle with its more believable, darker treatment.
0525948023|1.0|I tried.  I really did- to get through this book and see the relevance of it and find out what all the hoopla was about. But the whole thing was beyond me.  If I were to write this book, it would be one sentence long, a quote from the Bible \\"Humble yourself before the Lord and He will lift you up\\".  No pop psychology wrapped in philosophical jibberish for me.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|I'm not a following fan of the Die Hard series, my husband and I actually rented it first because there was nothing else at the movie store.  We loved it so much we bought it as a gift for my father-in-law who loves action movies.  If you like action and don't mind a \\"slightly\\" far fetched plot, this is a great movie!
0312379293|5.0|A fateful meeting between Danny Cartwright, an East End cockney garage mechanic, and Spencer Craig, a young West End barrister on the fast track to success, ends in Danny being arrested, convicted of murder--thanks to Spencer, who becomes the prosecution's main witness--and sent to prison, where he spends his time plotting to escape and seek revenge. BT.<br />I haven't read the 'Count of Monte Cristo' so I can't compare this novel to that one. All I know is this was one of Archer's finest novels in recent years. A compelling and enthralling story. Well written and well rounded. I enjoyed it immensely.<br />Jeffrey Archer goes back on my 'must read' list.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B00132D808|5.0|pretty. odd. is a departure from panic (formerly panic!) at the disco's older work. the songs have a stripped down feel but don't mistake simplicity for bad music. on the contrary this album has amazing musicianship and any real panic fan will appreciate this album. some of the standout favorites to me include:    That Green Gentleman (things are shaping up to be pretty odd.)  Nine In The Afternoon (i could play this song all day!)  Do You Know What I'm Seeing (i know its sad that i never gave a d*mn about the weather...)
B00009L1TA|2.0|Basic is another failure of a film from director John McTiernan. McTiernan who used to make good movies like Preadtor, Die Hard & Die Hard 3 hasn't made a good movie since Die Hard 3 spins this confusing film. On one hand I do give the director respect for his attempt to make an uodated version of Rashômon  but he film lacks the action sequences McTiernan is known for. The performances by Connie Nelson is horrible and she has a bad accent as for John Travolta he seems bored but as always Samuel L.Jackson delviers the good. The trailer spoils a lot for the film but trust me you try to figure out something in the film your head will hurt.
B0011FDVKE|4.0|If ever there were a convention of performing artists, Tift Merritt would probably spend the evening helping to serve the food, then staying afterward to help with the clean-up. There is something unfailingly polite about her style, so much so that she is an anomaly in an industry full of misogynists, hedonists, crybabies and creeps. \\"Another Country\\" captures that niceness with a series of songs that are unfailingly gracious in their gentle use of melodicism. It is extraordinarily comforting to hear an album as well-adjusted as \\"Another Country,\\" but that can also be part of the problem. In real life, it is the troublemakers who attract all of the attention, and it is no different in the music industry. Disaffected misfits with bad attitudes and re-hab issues get the press and top the charts, and it is difficult to hear Tift Merritt above the din of whining screamers in need of medication, therapy, or both.<br /> \\"Another Country\\" is the result of an artist burned out from too much touring. In the liner notes, Tift (I think she would find it distasteful if I used her formal name) writes that she \\"had lost track of the miles (she) had traveled.\\" To break her stride, she spent some time in Paris, familiarizing herself with a new culture and a new group of friends. The experience liberated her, and inspired her to new heights of creativity. This is an album full of personal observations from lessons learned, with intimate arrangements that focus on the strengths of her touring band, augmented by guitarists Doug Pettibone and Charlie Sexton. As a collection, the songs fit like a well-worn sweater. It is the aural equivalent of a woman finding a sense of comfort in the life she has chosen for herself.<br />Most parents know that necessity dictates them to spend most of their time and effort working with the `problem' child, while the well-adjusted sibling gets overlooked. It may take some time for you to come around to listening to Tift Merritt's new album, but when you do, it will wrap you with a sense of comfort and relief, and it will probably make you smile. B+ Tom Ryanwill wrap you with a sense of comfort and relief, and it will probably make you smile. B+ Tom Ryan
B00012FXAE|5.0|Aliens is one of the few films that can top the orinigal. James Cameron upped the action and the scares for a sequel that still holds up today. Ripley is tougher and braver in this film. The additon of the Marines adds more action and a higher body count and the apperance of the Queen Mother is scary as hell.  As for the DVD it's picture and sound are both top nothc,
B00000IFP6|5.0|Simply the best work done on the 9 symphonies that I ever had the luck to come across. I had been searching for the ninth in particular with the best directors, orchestras, and labels, but they all seemed to lack in either interpretation or sound quality. This collection has to be the standard to compare all the other recordings.
B00003CXMG|4.0|Almost Famous is a great movie even if you don't like rock & roll. Patrick Fugit as William is great in his first role as are seasoned verterans like Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson. The direction by Crowe is very good and he is very well informed about the music. I'm proud to have this movie in my DVD collection and I say that as a BLACK MALE.
B000OV170W|5.0|Wow!!  What an awesome and thought provoking book.  I could not put it down.  I finished it in 2 short days.  I can't wait to read another of her books.  As a parent this book makes me stop in my tracks and think. It also makes me thank God for the life I have and the health of my children. The end is unexpected, but it could only end that way.  BRAVO to the author.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Big is one of the most magaical films without special effects that I've ever seen. Tom Hanks broke away from TV & other typical roles and became a full flegeded star in the form of this film. Tome Hanks garned a well deseverd oscar nod for and Penny Marshall proved she was a good director and this is still one my favorite Penny films. Hopefully one day someone will release a better DVD with the alternate ending and a commentary from David Moscow and Tom Hanks.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|I bought this CD after hearing two of the singles on the radio, 'Society' and 'Big Hard Sun'.  The entire album was excellent.  I think it's some of the best music Eddie Vedder has ever done.  I like this album better than the Pearl Jam stuff from the nineties.  His voice sounds better than ever.  The music is moving and haunting.  And the movie was great too.
6305252572|4.0|48 HRS. is a good combo of action and comedy. Edddie handles all the funny stuff very and Nick plays a good cop. The action sequences by the stylish Walter Hill were some of the best in 1982. The film is full of action and comedy and is a real crowd pleaser. I remember reading somewhere that the role of Reggie Hammond was oringally written for Gregory Hines or Richard Pryor and one wonders the tone the film would have taken if either played the role but thankfully the chose who Murphy who carried the film very will and became a star in the making.
B000WCBPOG|1.0|After falling in love with the movie, I was anticipating a great soundtrack CD. I was wrong. Whoever did the sound mixing did a terrible job! It's so bad that it is distorted on several songs! The singers sound flat, as if this were a test run. Listen to the song \\"Dear Prudence\\"... they don't even come in on cue! (In the movie they do). I highly recommend the movie, and I'm sending the CD back!

B00005RHGL|5.0|First of All to Amazon all writers: United States Marshal is spelled with one \\"L\\", or seen as US Marshal, and Wyatt Earp was a Deputy US Marshal, as the region or federal US Marshal is and was a Presidential appointee who hires Deputy US Marshals (oldest US law enforcement started by President G. Washington in 1789).  The olde West would be the time in history that saw the highest death rate of some 50-70 Deputy US Marshal per year. The US Marshal Service is in charge of ALL federal prisoners once they have seen a US Judge and/or are incarcerated in prison or escaped Federal prisoners, they do Witness Security (not the FBI--as portrayed in \\"My Blue Heaven\\"), they have a 15 Most Wanted List (not a mere 10 of the FBI), they do all duties pertaining to the Federal Court system--including the security of all the Supreme Court Judges, and they have arrest powers in all 50 states plus all the US territories as well as working with Interpol.  They took Noriega into custody, did everything from John Gotti trials, Timothy McVeigh trial, Assassination attempt on Pope trials to the Twin Towers trials of 1990's.    Secondly--Val Kilmer truly was robbed of an academy award nomination and soared in every scene he appeared in, to the enjoyment of this viewer.  His portrayal of a diseased with TB, highly educated former dentist, now card-whiz at poker, gun-toting crack shot was masterful & perfect.  I would align Val's performance in the same category of scene-stealing-memorable performances as Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow but also to the Academy nominated Dustin Hoffman for his portrayal of a crippled petty thief named Ratzo Rizzo in \\"Midnight Cowboy\\"(1969). The 1993 Academy evidently had blinders on while preferring to nominate movies like:  \\"SCHINDLER'S LIST\\", \\"The Fugitive\\", \\"In the Name of the Father\\", \\"The Piano\\",and \\"The Remains of the Day\\" While ignoring Val Kilmer with his head-and-shoulders-above the acting jobs of that year--the Academy chose instead to award top honor supporting oscar to: TOMMY LEE JONES for his boringly monotone version of a too old guy huffing & puffing or yelling his way through each scene in \\"The Fugitive\\"; then Leonardo DiCaprio in the unmemorable acting of \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\"; Ralph Fiennes in the only oscar worthy of recognition role of \\"Schindler's List\\"; as was worthy of quirky and demented John Malkovich in \\"In the Line of Fire\\"; while long stretch of a part worth even mentioning Pete Postlethwaite in \\"In the Name of the Father\\".  Of course the common people are always disappointed by what the  dim bulbs of the Academy picks...usually going to their \\"time will tell how wrong they were\\" decisions that usually ignore the acting or work that shines for years long after Academy choices have disappeared from viewing eyes & ears.  My more recent example of Academy \\"huh?\\" decisions would be for any of the series of Lord of the Rings...as the first one generated comments from the Academy of: 'there were so many in that movie that were worthy of recognition that it would be wrong just to nominate one or two'--so they ignored the whole movie and did not nominate any of the cast of actors!  Giant, behemoth: \\"HUH?\\"       And to those few that did not like this movie...I direct you to the huge number of of pages over 400 comments of reviews that whole-heartedly adore, admire and recommend this film to others.  Try to find another movie with this much input.  \\"Tombstone\\" ROCKS and the only thing missing was more scenes with Doc Holiday by Val Kilmer!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Anercian Beauty is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The film is very dark, very funny and tragic. Kevin Spacey did give a very Oscar worthy performance as did Annette Beinnig. Mena Suvair plays Angela with top notch as a young women who uses seduction for her own purposes but has her own secerets. Sam Mendes makes an amazing film his first time out. The cinematography by Conrad Ball is some of the best ever put on film.
B0010X745K|4.0|I won't repeat the plot again, which has been well documented so far. Suffice to say this film works best when it allows itself to be a good old-fashioned monster movie. The mist itself is foreboding, and the tension among the characters palpable as they attempt desperately to determine where it comes from, what it holds, and how to escape. There is plenty of drama within the grocery store where many of the town's residents find themselves trapped, and it is here the movie occasionally bogs down. Like King himself, there is plenty of exposition among the various personalities. Unlike King, however, the payoff for such chatter is sometimes lacking. The general sense of dread from the unknown, being trapped, and the ensuing panic resulting in a mob mentality is best captured through the excellent film work and atmosphere rather than dialogue. And let's not forget the creatures, for there are many of them. Most are genuinely creepy and their appearances are regular, making for a fast-paced, action-oriented flick with plenty of scares to keep you interested. And though I was warned ahead of time about the surprising ending, I was in now way prepared for how it concluded. I'll let you find out, but it did stay with me after the credits rolled. If you are a horror fan, this is one you don't want to pass up.
B00012FXB8|3.0|Alien³ is the worst in the series because of the studio. David Fincehr had a dark film in his mind but the studio cut it down. The film does have a few good scares and the cinematography is cool. But the film is very slowly paced and most viewers won't be able to take it.
B000T0XED6|3.0|I think the late Harold C. Schonberg, influential critic for the NY Times, was the first to characterize Maurizio Pollini as a \\"cult figure\\" and \\"intellectual pianist\\" to whom musical color, charm, personality and emotion have little meaning. \\"Don't interpret, but just play the notes\\" was the then modern style of Pollini. \\"Cool perfection, impersonal sound and computer-like total control\\" according to Schonberg (The Great Pianists, Ch.37; 1987). These memorable words were written two decades ago, but they haven't lost their meaning. Now over 65, Pollini still is a cult figure with countless admirers (his concerts are immediately sold out, even if he only plays Stockhausen and Boulez; and read the uncritical five-star reviews here at Amazon). Being a cult figure is fine, but did Pollini change as a musician over the years? He surely became milder and more expressive, but at the same time he has maintained his reputation of a pianist whose playing lacks emotional content, warmth and depth. Gifted with a vast technique, Pollini can play anything with breathtaking tempi, flawless, and no mannerism or show-off whatsoever. Yet he is musically one-sided and emotionally aloof. He never tempts. Everything is done the same way - never a surprise. Regrettably, his recording of Beethoven's Op. 2 (or Op. 10 for that matter) is no exception.<br /><br />The opening of the F minor sonata (Allegro) is a breathless chase of events. No time for musical eloquence. The Menuetto (Allegretto) is rushed and lacks grace, not least because of exaggerated fortissimo's. In the fourth movement, the fine melodic line that starts from bar 35 (right hand octaves) is neglected. Yes, it is prestissimo, but that's no excuse for ignoring a melody that should sing. Plain-sailing pianism.<br /><br />Slow movements are the real touchstones. The beautiful Largo Appassionato of the A major sonata is too detached and crisp to my ears. To quote Gramophone: \\"Even in the slow movements, Pollini can be authoritarian, barking his orders at you with inflexible resolve\\". The Scherzo is rushed again (played Allegro instead of Allegretto) with too much pedal, while there is a conspicuous lack of humor in the Rondo Grazioso (Pollini and humor mix like water and oil; listen to Brendel for the humor and grace in this movement). Again lots of nervous intensity and little humanity in the C major sonata.<br /><br />These recordings are fine for the many worshippers of Pollini; for more musical eloquence and virtues others should look elsewhere. Looking elsewhere is not a challenge given the countless fine recordings of these sonatas. If you find the sound of the legendary Arthur Schnabel unacceptable, listen to Wilhelm Kempff, Claudio Arrau, Annie Fischer or Emil Gilels. The latter is my favorite; Gilels' Op. 2/2 is deeply moving and unsurpassed (unfortunately, he did not record no. 1). Murray Perahia also did a great job with his very musical and insightful interpretation of Op. 2. Newcomer Paul Lewis shouldn't be overlooked either (his Vol.3 of the Beethoven sonatas). A world of difference with Pollini.his orders at you with inflexible resolve\\". The Scherzo is rushed again (played Allegro instead of Allegretto) with too much pedal, while there is a conspicuous lack of humor in the Rondo Grazioso (Pollini and humor mix like water and oil; listen to Brendel for the humor and grace in this movement). Again lots of nervous intensity and little humanity in the C major sonata.     These recordings are fine for the many worshippers of Pollini; for more musical eloquence and virtues others should look elsewhere. Looking elsewhere is not a challenge given the countless fine recordings of these sonatas. If you find the sound of the legendary Arthur Schnabel unacceptable, listen to Wilhelm Kempff, Claudio Arrau, Annie Fischer or Emil Gilels. The latter is my favorite; Gilels' Op. 2/2 is deeply moving and unsurpassed (unfortunately, he did not record no. 1). Murray Perahia also did a great job with his very musical and insightful interpretation of Op. 2. Newcomer Paul Lewis shouldn't be overlooked either (his Vol.3 of the Beethoven sonatas). A world of difference with Pollini.
B00005JKMQ|4.0|Ali is a good film that could have been great. Will Smith plays Ali with great passiond vigor. Micheal Mann direction and cinematography is some the best work he has ever done, but the film drags in its second half and ends on a dry note. I think the film should ahve covered Ali's whole life not just ten years that were covered in the film. Until The Purusit Of Happyness, this was Will Smith's best performance as he gives the auidence the charmisa and charm that he displayed in Six Degrees Of Seperation. Ali is by no mean's a GREAT film but it is a good one.
B0000256VK|5.0|Avalon is, quite simply, one of the most lovely records ever made.  It has a sumptuous sound, it's power is in it's simplicity, and a great ensemble effort.  The band works as a cohesive unit, none upstaging the other or interrupting the mood with a particularly wicked solo. Bryan Ferry's amazingly lush vocals carry the mood completely from emotion to emotion, and the melodies linger for a lifetime.      I go back and forth between this record as my all-time favorite, and HATS by The Blue Nile, which is breathtaking in a very similar way. Yet I never seem to be able to let go of Avalon, and my guess is once you hear it, you won't be able to let it go either.
B0009A40ES|4.0|Christan Bale is one of my favorite actors and even though many conisder his work in Empire Of The Sun to be his breakthrough performance for me it's all about American Psycho. American Psycho was clearly one of the best movies released in the year 2000. The film is a thinking person horror movie and has humor and one of the best portyals of a serial killer in recent years. Mary Harron direction is very good and the performance by Christan Bale is top notch. I highly reccomned American Psycho .

B00006WUWN|3.0|Austin Powers in Goldmember is another great film in the shagadelic series. From the opening spoof AustinPussy one knows it's gonna be a great film. The jokes are on taregt , the script is witty and the cameos are great.Beyonce does a good acting job, despite what the critics said as her performances really just requires her to be eye candy. All in all a fun film.

B00004U3UG|3.0|Army of Darkness is a fine finish to a series of films that started with the classic movie The Evil Dead in 1982. The film has horror, action and one liners. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi have made another great film.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Settlers of Catan is for anyone who has watched three ours elapse while playing Risk and realized they still had most of the game to play.  Not only is Settlers quicker but it is much more intricate.  Gaining the necessary resources takes Risk's strategy and turns it up a notch.  Just try to conquer the world with out wheat; I mean, an Army Marches on its Stomach.  Actual game play shouldn't take you any longer then and hour and a half and you will be involved through the game.  Theres a reason this was the best selling game in Europe!
B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down is easily one of the best wat movies ever made. The war seqeunces are intense and hard to watch at times. But Ridley Scott has made a brilliant film with amazing cinematography and a fast paced film. Josh Hartnett really made his name in film in the lead role and I'm surpised he didn't get more action roles in the later years of his carrer.

079284131X|4.0|I recall when I was eight Childs Play was the first film to scare in a while. Tom Holland is one in the top catogery when it comes to horror directors. He plays it smart with his cinematography by not showing a lot of the killer until the middle act. The film proved that every day objects can scare you

B0000A7W14|5.0|Boyz N The Hood is a cinematic tour deforce. John Singelton has made an improtant film that every young man can realte to no matter what his ethnic background. I first remeber going to see Boyz N the Hood with my stepfather when I was ten years and even a child I understood the message behind the film. John Singleton's Oscar nomination for Best Director at the age of 24 makes him the youngest director to ever receive such an accolade, beating Orson Welles by a good 2 years and it was well earned. The acting in the film was very strong and all of the actors would gone on to finer things. Boyz N the Hood is a classic film that stood the test of the time.

0446310786|5.0|This book came out at a time when \\"civil rights\\" was first beginning to seep into mainstream American conversations. It was an uncomfortable subject, and had to be addressed with tact and diplomacy.    I feel that due to the publication of this book, and its rapid transformation into a feature film, the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964.    To Kill A Mockingbird was a striking statement made by Nelle Harper Lee, an Alabama native whose father was for most of his life a typical Southerner with typical Southern attitudes towards African Americans, According to Lee, this novel, her only one, is to remain a snapshot of the South, as it was during her youth, on the verge of it's first reluctant steps away from the shadows of its past.     Part One of the book is purely expository. All of the characters and the tenor of Maycomb, Alabama are thoroughly established. Part Two deals with a trial that laid out the basic injustice being practiced on a daily basis by the townspeople, and the epiphanies experienced thereafter by the narrator and her young brother.    In the end, this book is about compassion. The acquisition of compassion, in my opinion, is the litmus test every young adult must pass in order to reach a productive and happy adulthood. This book, taken with the right context, is a wonderful stepping stone for anyone needing an introductory course in compassion.    After reading this book, everyone would gladly have Scout as a friend, and Atticus as a father. The author outdid herself with this contribution, and that fact, sadly, made To Kill a Mockingbird, her only contribution to the Great Conversation.

B0013ND30M|5.0|In a sense, this was my Snow White.<br /><br />  When I was a kid, my family never bothered with Snow White, Pinocchio, Cinderella, even Peter Pan. We ended up with Alice, Fantasia and Sleeping Beauty when they were released on VHS. And were better for it.<br />  My sister and I used to love Maleficant because she was such a ... well, lets just say a \\"female dog\\". And for no reason it seemed. Oh, because she wasn't invited to Aurora's Birthday Party? Pfft...<br /><br />  Grab it on BLU-RAY this time though so you don't miss the band wagon.<br />Grab it on DVD too if you feel the need ( though really you should already own it on DVD from the last time it was out a few years back ).<br />  Even if you don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, when you get one you'll have a Disney Classic ready and waiting to impress the neighbours. And it'll save you looking for it in 4 years time after its discontinued!!!<br /><br />  I have nothing to add about how good to the movie actually is, because we all know how good a movie it is. Also, just by the by, grab<br />Fantasia on BluRay when they get around to re-releasing that.<br />  Believe me, your kids will thank you. My daughter Trixxie watches her Snow White DVD at least 4 times a week. I really don't enjoy it that much, that and its sad at the end, but hey she loves it, so lucky I bought it on DVD when I had the chance.<br />  Hooray Sleeping Beauty Woo.
0143038419|5.0|This book was given to me by a friend and unlike some people, I was captivated by the author.  I found her to be funny and honest.  Some may say that she is a spoiled brat because she seems to have a perfect marriage, career, life, etc.  But is that what happiness is all about?  Is it the big house, the extra large bank account, diplomas on the wall and a seemingly perfect spouse at home what makes happiness?  I firmly believe that it's not. Sometimes we need to do things for ourselves in life.  If it meant leaving her marriage because she wasn't happy, she shouldn't be criticized for that.  She should be praised for not pretending.  I have seen so much of this from people in my life, and it seems to end with therapy, antidepressants and ultimatly, divorce.      So the author has stereotypes.  Don't we all.  Every single one of us would be lying to ourselves if we said that we didn't have an assumption of what someone from a certain state or country, ethnic group or religion is like. We are human.  We do that (i'm not saying it's right, just that we do that). At least Gilbert was honest about hers.  And so she thinks Italians are sexy (not how she put it, but if you read the book you understand). Is that such a bad thing?  And OK she didn't talk about the poverty in India.  Had she dove into the nitty gritty about everything she saw, both positive and negative,it would take years to write the story and centuries to finish it.  Her travels weren't about that.  They where about her learning who SHE was as a person.  It floors me that people think that there is something wrong with that.  So she shopped and ate, and made friends and found a lover.  That't life.  Remember when she met Felipe and she was considering breaking her vow of celibacy for the year?  She felt guilty.  It wasn't like she said, \\"oh well\\" and jumped in his bed.  She made sure she was making the right decision and not jumping into another potentially \\"dangerous\\" relationship.      If you read the book, and you either loved it or hated it, you can agree that she enjoyed herself in Italy, she learned about God, prayer and forgiveness in India, and about love in Indonesia.  Look what she did for Wayan and Tutti???  Gathering her friends to make sure that that woman and her children weren't homeless-wow, that's love.  Felipe brought a different kind of love into her life.  So she achieved everything that she wanted on her travels.  She ate, prayed, and loved.  She made me laugh, she taught me lessons, and she inspired me to want to know ME.  In my opinion of course, that was her point. To learn about herself, and share that journey with others so that they can learn about themselves also.     If you haven't figured it out yet, I liked the book.  In fact I recommend it.  And-I can't wait for her next book.
1594489505|5.0|Awesome book!  A MUST read!     The book arrived fairly quickly and brand new.  Also would recommend this author's previous book, The Kite Runner.

009917961X|3.0|The rainmaker was my second Grisham (after The Testament), my expectations from the book were very high (particularly after reading the so many five star reviews and knowing that it seems Grisham's most popular work). I found the book was entertaining, fun to read nevertheless lacked of something, for example in the beginning of the book Rudy faces an event which later in the book is not even mentionned, he is pursued by the police for suspicion of having burnt down a building, this makes a big fuss in the start of the book but then is completely forgotten? What happened there I don't know? Did Mr. Grisham forget to continue that part of the story...? Also a similar thing happens with Mrs. Birdy, a woman who seems the center of attention quiet regularly throughout the book, as she is a ''millionaire'' and the young Lawyer advices her a lot about her will and how she should share her money after her death, towards the end of the book it seemed to me at some point that the author barely gave any attention to her story and merely disclosed the affair by saying that she was after all not a millionaire but thought she was and actually had barely any money.. I found that a bit strange as well.    In the end the young Lawyer wins the case, but nothing much happens, he ends up leaving the town with the young girl he has met at the Hospital, the closing line being that he will not practice Law as a career but prefer to teach History (a simple life rather than a complicated one), ok fair enough but the decision seemed a bit sudden, and the final note of the book was also a bit suprising.    Entertaining, but I had found it dissapointing and most of all surprising that so many people praise the book so much.

There are some topics that parallel [[ASIN:1432720805 The Spoken Words of Spirit: Lessons From The Other Side]]  The power of the mind and positive approaches discussed are mostly on point.

0452289963|5.0|This is one of those books that helps to awaken the soul.  It teaches that if you keep your physical ego out of the equation, life itself can be lived to a more fulfilling joy.  I'm not sure if others will see it in this light, but for me it is definitely a book that helps you achieve the focus and definition that this life can hold for everyone.

B000PKG6TE|5.0|I'm not surprised at all the negative reviews here, because this album is different, which scares people. It rocks, it sputters, it lurches. It's hard. It sounds broken and industrial. The guitars are insane, all over the place. Even Josh Homme's vocals are different than anything he's ever done before.     So if you want to hear Songs for the Deaf Part II, don't buy this album. If you want to hear an album that's fresh and exciting and exactly what rock and roll should sound like in 2008, then pony up for this masterpiece. Best QOTSA album ever.
B00005MP58|5.0|Of all the Pride and Prejudice movies I have seen this is by far the best and is one of my all time favorite movies.  The characters are well developed and interpreted.  After seeing this movie all other interpretations of the book will seem trivial. For those who enjoy period pieces this is a must see.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This version of the soundtrack seemed to be the best bargain for me. I didn't need all the extra stuff that came with some of the special editions and I didn't feel that the two missing tracks were that essential, especially since you can buy them separately on iTunes or even Amazon. I thought the music for the movie was great and I see it as a tribute to how influential and prolific the Beatles were. And I don't think that Paul McCartney gets enough credit. If you see this album and movie as blasphemy to the memory of this great band, don't buy them. Simple as that. If you're a real fan and enjoy the Beatles' music in any form, you'll like the soundtrack.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I am in the health care industry.  I have 2 master's degrees in the health services field.  I knew every basic concept that was covered in this film, but Moore tied it all together to create a big and basic picture:  What's good for the bottom line is never good for anyone but those at the top.<br /><br />I work in community health.  We are the safety net responsible for taking care of some of the 45 million uninsured in this country, and I am disheartened and infuriated that every day we have to try to do more and more with fewer resources, resulting in the inability to provide high-quality care and work with people to keep them healthy.<br /><br />I am still surpised when I read that people think this movie is funny.  This movie is anything but funny.  It should outrage people enough to DEMAND the basic human right of coverage for health care from our government and make them realize that a for-profit privatized system in the mess that is corporate America is NOT the way to ensure a healthy, productive, able, dignified, and heaven forbid, happy nation.  I was appalled when I came to the conclusion that in the U.S., we are made to feel bad or inadequate if we want to be healthy, less stressed out, work less, take time for ourselves, and take care of ourselves and our families. We're always told that \\"other people have it much worse\\", but what about the fact that other people have it much better?  Have we arrived at total complacency and apathy in the U.S.?  Why don't the masses believe that we deserve better and act on it?  What the hell happened to Democracy and why has it become so inaccessible and barrier-ridden to so many?<br /><br />Don't answer that, I already know...it's tough to spend money on preventive health and public education when you've got countries to invade and other countries to \\"protect\\" yourself against, all while trying to make more, more and more money.  Maybe if we weren't so easily fooled into believing that we need to protect ourselves and instead could just focus on not antagonizing other nations to nuke us, and if we could understand that not all foreign interaction must result in more cash for us, we could get our priorities straight.  The British gentleman who is a former government authority (can't remember his name as I was already all spun up at this point of the movie) had it right:  When a government keeps its people uneducated, unhealthy and afraid, the people therefore cannot be empowered to act in order to do what's right for them.<br /><br />Bravo to Michael Moore, I admire the detailed homework and artful editing he put into this movie.  Sicko is his best yet, and for me, it has affected my life because I now understand that it's important to NOT buy into the \\"Spoiled Americans Think They're Entitled To Everything\\" B.S.  The time has come to demand more, hold our government and one another accountable, and freakin' GROW UP as a nation.<br /><br />The other option is to move and take my knowledge, skills and talents to some other country who will appreciate it. Believe me, I am seriously considering it, as I cease to be an enagaged staff member.  America will fail to retain me due to the perception that I am not valued, cannot rely on the country's HR department to provide me with adequate health coverage and other life benefits, and do not believe in the Mission, Vision or Values being driven by this nation's CEO.t focus on not antagonizing other nations to nuke us, and if we could understand that not all foreign interaction must result in more cash for us, we could get our priorities straight.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|It took me a couple of viewings to really enjoy Bladerunner, but this new final cut won me over. The 1080p transfer is beautiful. I really can't believe the color looks as good a it does for something that was filmed in 1982. The visuals are still mind blowing, not to mention way ahead of it's time, and the cast couldn't be better. Though this film received little attention in the early 80's, it has stood the test of time. It took me an entire night just to get through half the interesting extras. Worth every penny spent on one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made!
0743496736|5.0|This was a very well written story. It was a emotional read because of the nature of its topic.

I am an addict of her books I love them and this is one of the high books for me. It was very enjoyable!  Jamie
B000E33VWW|4.0|Capote is a rare thing: a beautifully shot film that subtly develops its characters through action and dialogue.    And that's really about it.    It's not necessarily a bad thing, though. The story's okay, and the acting is good, of course, but those things are not nearly as compelling as the way this film develops the character of Truman Capote. I think what I like best about this character development is that the movie doesn't try to be an all-encompassing biography like [[ASIN:B00005JND5 Ray (Widescreen Edition)]]. It gives us a snapshot into Capote's life by showing him during a four-year period, concentrating almost completely on the writing of [[ASIN:0375507906 In Cold Blood]]. It's not a biopic by any means, and yet I think it defines Truman Capote much better than most biopics do with their main characters. Give me a subtle movie like Capote over a drawn out life of a celebrity any day.    I'm not saying it's perfect, for in some ways, the story drags on. As Capote waits to find out what happens to the killers, we the audience wait with him, wondering what will happen. It's kind of like being stuck on the ship in the middle of the Atlantic in [[ASIN:B0001HLVS2 Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World (Widescreen Edition)]]. The main character's in limbo, so we're in limbo, too. But Capote manages to pick up the pace again rather quickly, and we watch with Capote as he witnesses what appears to become a seminal event in his life. The events of the novel Capote writes aren't that interesting, either, and watching Capote become a part of the killers' lives is only partially interesting. It's the way the movie develops Capote with this one event that continually moves me.    Watching this one event unfold and witnessing how it effects the main character is truly fascinating.

B00111L0MY|3.0|The Blu-ray features are what you'd expect for a DVD/Blu-ray, but nothing monumental was revealed in any of them. Quality is great, which  is expected from any new film.    I felt the movie held it's strength in the authenticity of its characters and the actors themselves (some of which were locals).   I'd say the downside of this realistic debut drama from Director, Ben Affleck (Starring his younger brother Casey) would be how undeveloped the plot is.    Unfortunately I can't critique the plot without spoiling the film... so I won't. I will say this though, the plot seems to be a sequence of interesting scenes but not necessarily a cohesive solid piece once put together. There is an outstanding cast but unfortunately the choppiness doesn't allow for the deep character development we'd expect from such a heart wrenching themed film.    I will also mention that Ben refers to Boston as his hometown for reference reasons, but he along with Casey Affleck and Matt Damon are from Cambridge, MA.    3 out of 5 Star Film. Great Quality Blu-ray w/ average Special Features.

Meditations gives you great insight into the age of Marcus Aurelius and the standards he tried to live up to.<br /><br />This is one of the better old books I have read and it is really accessible. If you have ever read a Plato book, you might know what I mean. You want to learn about historical people, but not at all cost.<br /><br />You will definitly have your money's worth with this one as Meditations describes the thoughts, standards and intentions Marcus Aurelius had in great detail. The writings really made me connect with the book as if I wanted to live up to these standards as well. It's hard to describe, but in essence this book should appeal to many readers.<br /><br />Meditations is a classic.

0307237702|4.0|Let me start by saying that I am moderate.  I don't agree with all of Obama's policies.  I do not think he is the most amazing political candidate to ever run for office.    That being said, I think Obama is extremely intelligent.  He is extremely humble.  As this book shows, he is eloquent and thoughtful.  His life circumstances have blessed him with an amazing perspective.    What I find refreshing about this book (and Obama) is that both seem very genuine.  Our political landscape has been fraught with so much posturing over the years that it's hard to tell what candidates really believe in anymore.  I'm tired of the games, the back-stabbing, and the extreme partisianism.  Obama is too.    Even if he accomplished NOTHING in the short-term during his 4 years in office (should he be elected), I think his presence might begin to break down some of the barriers that have traditionally prevented political progress.  What we need more than anything is a senate and a house that COMMUNICATES RESPECTFULLY.  One that cooperates.  One that compromises for the sake of the greater good.  And a legislature like this can only be formed under the leadership of a man who is willing to do the same.      If there is anything that this book, and Obama's speech about J. Wright taught me, it's that he is a man who knows how to communicate.  He knows how to look at situations from different perspectives.

The rest of the stories are diverse versions of these basic hand full of plots. It's what makes Shakespeare a Classic... and the rest of those great artists.    The concepts of betrayal, loyalty, love, and death. Money and murder etc.     Rashomon had a plot o this magnitude, and for the time, this film is amazing. The scenes are amazing! I can't imagine what this guy looked like on set making it happen, but I imagine every time I watch this film.
0452289963|1.0|This book claims to have no religious affiliations, but then it turns around and uses leaders and scriptural teachings from different religions that all teach opposite things.<br /><br />The problem with Tolle's view is that he believes matter (form) is bad.  People are bad.  Our bodies are bad.  Money is bad.  We need to escape from all this and live in \\"enlightened minds\\".  There is a reason we were given bodies, and I believe our bodies are a gift.  I also believe our thoughts, our posessions, our world, all of these things are gifts.  Yes, people misuse them, but that doesn't mean there is no room for redemption in the world, so we should just \\"mentally escape\\".<br /><br />I personally believe that God gave us our bodies AND our minds as gifts.  Both can be used for good or for evil.  Simply denying ourselves for the sake of denial seems empty to me.  Think of a small child.  Pretend he has a crayon in his hand and you want to get him to give you the crayon.  If you ask him for it, tell him that it's bad and he doesn't need it, or tell him it's only going to clutter his life, he will probably ignore you and just clutch it more tightly in his fist.  But if you walk over to him and reveal something totally wonderful (to him) like a new toy truck, he will probably let the crayon drop to his side and reach out with both hands to grasp the truck.<br /><br />My point is this:  life should be about reaching for something better, not denying ourselves of things we label as \\"bad\\".  There is joy to be found in this earthly life, and that joy IS discovered when we let go of things that selfishly clutter our minds.  But we cannot \\"will ourselves\\" to think certain thoughts and let them go.  We must find something else to fill us up, so that we no longer have ROOM in our minds to think of those \\"things of the world\\" in the same context.  I believe the Christian faith offers us that very thing in Christ.  And the best part is, we don't have to do the work.  He works in us!<br /><br />Tolle's book offered me nothing but discouragment by telling me that there is something I \\"must do\\" (will my thoughts away from my ego) in order to reach the elite stage of enlightment where I can live fully in the present.  What about people who \\"can't do it\\"?  Those who try really hard to escape their ego and reach new levels of consciousness...but keep falling back into their \\"primal\\" natures?  Are they doomed to stupid, joyless lives?  That doesn't seem fair.<br /><br />I don't believe Tolle.

0143038583|5.0|Spring approaches. It's azaleas in Atlanta, cherry blossoms in Washington, and further a field, in Kyoto. On the high plains it is wind.  Mr. Pollen did not write a travel book, but because of him I'll be off to visit Garden City, Kansas, inspired by such lines as:  \\"Yet I'm sure that after enough time goes by, and the stink of this place is gone from my nostrils, I will eat feedlot beef again.  Eating industrial meat takes an almost heroic act of not knowing or, now, forgetting.\\" He followed the cow that he purchased in South Dakota to Garden City, saw the feedlot where the cows are pumped full of antibiotics, and was overwhelmed by the smell of the products destined for so many stomachs.<br /><br />This is a rich book, on several dimensions.  Just to read it for the sheer knowledge it imparts - how corn accidentally came to dominate our diets, and our lives. How the diet of cows was transformed from grass to corn. He takes a hard look at the politics behind such a transformation, identify Earl Butz, Nixon's Secretary of Agriculture, as being the key individual in bringing us the era of cheap corn.  He looks at that will-o-wisp called \\"costs\\", and shows how government policies provided tremendous subsidies so that corn would become a \\"welfare queen.\\"<br /><br />The book's structure is centered on four different kinds of meals:  industrial, big organic, local organic, and the one that was hunted / collected by the eater.  One is allowed to ponder how all this time and energy which is tied to the industrial meal makes our food so much worse.  Mr. Pollen takes us inside General Mills in Minneapolis, where amid much secrecy very highly-paid individuals are paid to devise food products so that Americans will eat even more, because \\"Wall Street\\" demands greater growth than the increase in food consumption which would occur through normal population growth.  He takes us to \\"industrial organic\\" in California, and truly explains how \\"organic\\" is so often \\"not very.\\" He is never permitted inside a real slaughter house - the companies get away with this prohibition by claiming a need for \\"food security.\\" He recommends glass abattoirs to improve the process, as was approximated at the local organic farm in the Shenandoah Valley. And with considerably resourcefulness and willingness to venture into new fields, he hunts his own food for one meal.<br /><br />He is wonderfully erudite, and surprises with such gems as: \\"For Isaac, the nugget is a distinct taste of childhood, quite apart from chicken, and no doubt a future vehicle of nostalgia - a madeleine in the making.\\" He has brought together numerous disciplines to produce this book - truly one of the essential reads of the year, and one that will quite possibly modify your life.

Throu the brilliance and feeling of Beatles music I felt like I was back in High School, went and found my draft card in my old stuff. Wondered if I was in trouble when I got my Uncle Sam letter, because I never showed. The Beatles music - I never realized how timeless it is. Only missed John Lennon's voice on one song. The people behind this movie are to be congratulated and recognized as the creative genius they are. First Rate!!!
B000JSI7AI|5.0|As a movie aficionado, I make a practice of seeing films that pique the intellect, the imagination, and the heart. Ang Lee's tour de force is a team effort (as evidenced by the \\"extras\\" on the second dvd) that bursts the bounds of all three standards of measurement. There is not a flawed frame in the entire film. I have watched Brokeback Mountain numerous times and I find it an honor to make the journey so lovingly scripted by McMurtry and Ossana. Everyone involved deserves kudos for sweeping courage.
0143038419|5.0|I originally resisted this book because it is classified as non-fiction and I thought it would be a preachy, dull, self-help book.  (Maybe there's something to this Oprah thing?)  After all, we all search for everything.  It turned out that Eat, Pray, Love was wonderfully engaging, easy to relate to, and very, very thought provoking on a deeply personal level (more 'I really like how she talks about God. . .I never would have atriculated it that well'. . . than 'What the heck is she talking about?')  A wonderful journey filled with warmth, wonder and joy. A great choice for anyone standing at a crossroads in their life, or just stuck in a rut.  Or doing just fine.

0861714911|5.0|According  to  one  survey,  it  was  said  that  America produces  many   millionaires each year.      Supposing that you are one of the lucky one, you earn the wealth righteously and you are also a Buddhist. What is the right view that you should hold in dealing with the wealth acquired?      This is the million dollars question and of course many enthusiastic people would shower you lots of unsolicited advice.       Beware! Beware!       Their intentions are good but the advices may not necessarily correct and accurate if you examine them closely.      So, what did the Buddha say about the million dollars question?      It  is  fortunate  that  now we  can  refer  to  the wonderful  book  entitled  \\"In  the Buddha's Words:  An  Anthology  of  Discourses  from  the  Pali  Cannon\\",  compiled  by  highly respected America born Bhikkhu Bodhi. This book collects many important teachings by the Buddha. In essence, this book is for anyone who wishes to gain benefits by practicing Dhamma that leads to happy present life, happy future life and the ultimate good.       From  time  to  time,  the  past  and  living masters  always  caution  the  believers  not  to  get trapped in the big palace of Buddhist suttas or sutras in Sanskrit. This book provides an invaluable map to those who wish to find the way out in this majestic palace. Whatever level  of  spiritual  goal  you  have  in  mind,  you  can  rely  on  this  map  to  reach  your destination.       Surprisingly, many other advices of similar nature can be found. For example, how to be united  in  future  lives  for husband and wife who are deeply  in  love, how  to  repay one's parent etc. In my opinion, this book has convincingly dispelled the common wrongly held belief that Buddha only  teaches the Dhamma for  the people who renounce. As shown in this  book, many  of  Buddha's  teachings  are  for  those who  still  stuck  in  the  routine  of worldly life!      For those who do not have to worry about the milliondollars question and wonder why this book is special, perhaps you can listen to what H.H. the Fourteenth Dalai Lama has said in the forward:       \\"What I find especially encouraging about this book is that it shows so clearly how much fundamentally all schools of Buddhism have in common. I congratulate Bikkhu Bodhi for the careful work of compilation and translation\\"       What about the answer to the million dollars question mentioned earlier?      The answer can be found in Pg 126-127 under the heading \\"The Proper use of Wealth\\". Let's preview the details of the first out of the four sound advices given:      \\"With  the  wealth  thus  gained  he  makes  himself  happy  and  pleased  and  properly maintains  himself  in  happiness;  he makes  his  parents  happy  and  pleased  and  properly maintains  them  in  happiness;  he makes  his wife  and  children,  his  slaves, workers  and servants happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness; he makes friends and colleagues happy and pleased and properly maintains them in happiness. This is the first case of wealth gone to good use, fruitfully applied and used for a worthy cause\\"      How  amazing! Not  only  the  servants,  even  the  slaves  are  supposed  to  be  included  for sharing. Remember, these words were spoken twenty five hundreds years ago.       Of course, after earning a million, you might want more. The answer can be found in the fourth advice.      I strongly encourage you to find out straight from the mouth of the Buddha!        About the reviewer:       Benjamin  F  C  TENG  PhD,  was  born  in  Singapore.  Currently,  he  is  working as associate  professor  in engineering in a university  at  San  Juan,  Puerto  Rico,  USA. He  is  a  sangha member of two Tibetan Buddhist centers (Email: tengfc@yahoo.com).
B000SNUMC0|5.0|Like many Iced Earth fans i got into the band at the time of _Something Wicked This Way Comes_ and impatiently awaited the full concept album for years and years. i was a little leery after _The Glorious Burden_, which is an unbalanced album, largely because i was rather unappreciative of the vocals. The Ripper's vox were sometimes really great, and sometimes really cheesy. Now that the first part of the concept, _Framing Armageddon_, is out, so what is the final judgment? Awesome and worth the wait!<br /><br />This is probably the best all-round album since _Night of the Stormrider_ (interestingly, neither album has Barlow!), and it reaches the same heights as the best Iced Earth. It's definitely more on the power metal side, more so than _Horror Show_ and _The Glorious Burden_, but despite its subject matter _Framing Armageddon_ avoids the cheese Iced Earth often gets caught with. More than anything Schaffer here appears to have emulated Hansi's approach to vocals in Blind Guardian - HUGE. Choruses of such grandeur, melody, and vocal multitude that only Blind Guardian compares in metal. As much emphasis as there is on the army-of-vocals choruses, Tim Owens' vocals themselves really should be emphasized. They are awesome on these songs. He really is a great, versatile vocalist to whom i should have given more credit in the first place. Even with Matt Barlow's return on the forthcoming Part II, and even when he performs these songs originally by Owens, the goodness of the original performance will always be valued. The atmospheric interludes, lots of stuff from violent synth'd battle sounds and haunting passages arranged for acoustic guitars and obscure, worldly percussion instruments.<br /><br />This is perhaps the least Iced Earth sounding album Iced Earth has done, for better or worse. The focus here is definitely a specific vision that has less of Schaffer's individual personality and is more its own thing. Personally i think it is very successful. The beginning is awesome with the epic, mood-setting \\"Something Wicked Part I\\". The middle is full of good fast and mid-tempo power metal tracks like \\"Setian Massacre\\", \\"Ten Thousand Strong\\", \\"Order of the Rose\\", \\"Retribution Through the Ages\\", \\"Infiltrate and Assimilate\\" - quite Blind Guardian-esque in my opinion, and other stuff like the prog-metal-ish \\"Domino Decree\\", the Floydian first half of \\"The Clouding\\", and the brutal gnashing of \\"Framing Armageddon\\". All the songs are very individual sounding and evocative. The album also has an incredible finale (\\"When Stars Collide\\"), a slow, dire monster with massive choral presence, more foreboding than almost any finale. The final instrumental piece \\"Awakening\\" closes the album on the softer note, and really...if i am permitted to nitpick, this was Schaffer's only mistake. The final note of \\"When Stars Collide\\" leaves the listener with a very heavy sense of foreboding and dread, and provides for the ultimate cliffhanger while we wait for pt. 2. \\"Awakening\\" is fine and pleasant, but it might detract from the ending. i dunno.<br /><br />Final note: as one other reviewer wisely notes, \\"his CD should be reevaluated once the sequel comes out.\\" i completely agree, and think it will probably be even better when joined by its second half.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|Tobey Maguire acting like he's too cool for school for 20 minutes just is unnatural and wrong in this movie which is what lowers the rating for me. I can understand him going around and maybe doing uncharacteristic things like pushing and shoving people or so kind of aggressive behavior, but acting like he's Mel Gibson in \\"What Women Want\\" just doesn't work. They should have had Tobey continue being the mostly nerdy guy that works for him and just add some extra aggression, not try and turn him into the Alpha-Male.     Harry dies which completely sucks because he was just coming around to being a possibly cool side-kick and the back and forth with MJ ends up completely unresolved.

0688172377|4.0|I looked for a book off my shelves that I hadn't read yet and came upon this one-- one I've been meaning to read ever since I first heard of Waris Dirie a few months ago when she disappeared for a few days and made the international news.<br /><br />As I had a few hours to wait for my son to finish his pottery class, I dove right into this book. And, it was very good. I was able to finish it before my son's class was over 2 1/2 hours later.<br /><br />Waris' life has definitely been interesting and, in some cases, very sad.  Born in Somalia, she lived with her nomadic family for her first 13 years.  As she notes, all ages are estimates, since they didn't really pay attention to birthdays.  She begged her mother to be circumcised when she was five years old-- obviously, she had no idea what that meant, at all-- she only knew it meant she was considered more grown up.  And, this was the kind you read about-- the kind that removes both the inner and outer labia and the clitoris.  The woman that did the \\"surgery\\" sawed her with a rusty bloody broken blade that she spat on and wiped dry before cutting.  Waris' circumcision left her infibulated-- with only the smallest opening that made menstruation and urination extremely painful.<br /><br />She does discuss this, one of the most abhorrent practices, but she also discusses much more. Much of her life was very happy-- although they were very poor.  She loved both parents but ran away when she was 13 (through the desert with no shoes or water) or so to avoid a marriage to a much older man (for the price of five camels!).<br /><br />Through an odd chain of events, she was able to go to London to be a servant for some wealthy relatives.  And, when this family planned to return to Somalia, Waris decided to stay in London.  She was very soon discovered by a photographer and almost immediately became a top model.<br /><br />Waris' tells her story in simple, yet stark language-- she speaks her mind and is a likeable and strong woman.  Her memoir is definitely interesting and she's very open about all her feelings and thoughts. The only thing I would have preferred she talk about more were her feelings about Islam.  I realize that genital mutilation is not mandated by the Koran-- it is only a tradition in many of these families.  However, her thoughts about her religion and some of its laws and archaic practices that affected her family (polygyny and its treatment of women, for instance), would have made the book a bit more intriguing.  She didn't go into this at all.<br /><br />All in all, this was a provocative memoir of someone raised so entirely differently than those of us in the West.

B000P12LWY|3.0|At each episode they said this was his story from the begining - what a crock of you-know-what! I was yelling at the screen by the third show.   They had many faults and shortcuts; they admit it,(and I forgive them because this is a huge story to tell in any form).  However, if you say that this is the COMPLETE story you must show more of the marriage Henry and Katherine had early on and the difficulties she overcame to be queen. One , ONE lousy episode could have covered that and given a \\"fuller\\" view of Henry's turn in personality.  They wanted sex and lies and jumped right into it. It's Showtime not BBC; and it also pulls you in.  Bottom line - I watched the season in 2 and half days glued to the screen, and cursing it!
B0000844I8|5.0|I have only two issues with this flick: Too much emphasis on character relations with less action, and the director/producer commentary. First, the dir/prod explain that they had a whole lot more dialog than in the movie that they cut out - saying that it was more important (to them) that the interaction of communication between the cultures(worlds) and breaking down the lanuage barrier was better served. I agree to a point, but this is about good against evil: action speaks louder than words.<br />Secondly, the commentary is informative, but pretty annoying....(sorry, guys) - I especially didn't like the \\"....we had absolutely NOTHING to do with the TV series...\\" comment. They didn't elaborate.<br />Aside from that, The movie frickin' rocks! Who knew it would spawn a 10  season TV series! (I think this is one of Spader's and Russell's best performances... very natural looking in their respective roles)

Highway to hell is one of the latest victims of the loudness war, and this cd is compressed to death. Clipping is evident and the sound is consistently grating. Too bad increases in technology mean worse sounding cds. Pick up the orginal Atlantic cd - its much more dynamic - and consequently better sounding. And to those who say older cds are mastered not as loudly as todays - yeah, that's the point - more dynamic range. If it's not loud enough, guess what? All you have to do is turn up the volume. Best AC/DC album ruined by HORRIBLE mastering

0375759174|4.0|Jane Austen wrote \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in the late 1790's, but it was not finally published until 1818, after her death.  It is a broad satire of the Gothic Romance novels popular in her day.  Its lead character, the innocent young Catherine Morland, is moderately attractive, good-hearted, and highly imaginative, but perhaps the least compelling of Austen's heroines.  Nevertheless, Jane Austen's excellent writing gifts are on display in this short novel, which offers some superbly funny dialogue, witty commentary on social manners, and a sympathetic heroine.<br /><br />Catherine is offered the opportunity to vacation in the resort town of Bath by family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen.  In Bath, she falls in with two people her own age, Isabella and John Thorpe.  Isabella is to be engaged to Catherine's brother James, while John, a college friend of James, takes an interest in Catherine.  The Thorpes involve the inexperienced Catherine in the social whirl of Bath.  They will also provide her with some hard lessons in manners.<br /><br />Catherine also meets Henry and Elinor Tilney, a brother and sister who introduce her to walks and intellectual discussion.  Their father, the imposing General Tilney, invites Catherine to visit the family estate of Northanger Abbey.  Catherine eagerly accepts the invitation, in part to stay close to Henry, on whom she has a crush, and in part to see the ancient abbey, sure to be the embodiment of her cherished Gothic Romances.<br /><br />Catherine's willingness to see dark secrets in ordinary events leads her on a search of the Abbey for clues to the suspected murder of General Tilney's wife.  In a gentle confrontation, Henry ends the search, but is not able to save her from the sudden wrath of the General, who banishes her from the Abbey.  A heartbroken Catherine is separated from Henry and Catherine, and returned unceremoniously to her home.  There, an unexpected visit by Henry Tilney will offer an explanation for what happened at Northanger Abbey and a chance to reunite with the Tilneys.<br /><br />Readers expecting a story with the heft of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or \\"Mansfield Park\\" may be disappointed. However, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fun book on its own terms, very much a Jane Austen product and likely to be enjoyed by her fans.  It is highly recommended as an entertaining read.ce to reunite with the Tilneys.    Readers expecting a story with the heft of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or \\"Mansfield Park\\" may be disappointed.

And that ambition pays off in spades.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the best of this genre since the lamented demise of [[ASIN:B000EXDP7S Jellyfish]]. From the \\"Penny Lane\\" horns on the first single \\"Nine in The Afternoon\\" to the Faux-Dylan/Byrds \\"Folking Around,\\" Panic not only shoot for these classic song styles, they hit the mark on just about every song. (Electric Light) Orchestras have mostly supplanted synths, rich Queenly harmonies permeate many tracks, and there are even nods to Big Band and cabaret. As the album closes, the Psychedelic Pop Swirls of \\"Mad As Rabbits\\" evoke so many great trippy pop bands from the past that Panic now finds themselves among their ranks.<br /><br />Much the same way My Chemical Romance jumped the creative chasm when they released the terrific [[ASIN:B000I5Y8ZU The Black Parade]], Panic at the Disco plunder all the best elements of classic rock and pop before putting the pieces back together in their own personal pattern. When multiple Brendon Uries announce at the album opening that \\"we're still the same band,\\" it's both a declaration and a whopper. They are still Panic At The Disco, the song titles are silly and the lyrics are cheeky (ala Mentors Fall Out Boy's [[ASIN:B000LC4ZIK Infinity on High]]), but they're an older and more expansive bunch, especially given that the members are barely into their 20's. \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" takes PATD and lifts them beyond the music of their debut and to whole new plateau. I have had this for just a couple of days and can't stop listening.

B000W0DFDM|2.0|I think I saw this book on Oprah, and while I was at the library, I thought I would check it out and see what it was about. At the time, I picked through this book as a woman who didn't have a boyfriend or any other guy on the radar besides a lot of male friends, but every red blooded American girl I have an ex, and I have girlfriends who were going through some of the troubles covered by this book.    In short, this book is both good and bad. On one hand, it offers some good, straight forward advice, such as if a guy is not calling you, he's probably not into you, which is advice your friends should tell you, but can't bring themselves to, which is refreshing, but on the other hand, this book is a bit general, and does offer some not so good advice.     The first thing that caught my eye was the chapter He's just that into you if he only wants to see you when he is drunk--Isn't this pretty explainatory? Why would you even need to write a chapter like this?Maybe the chapter sould be renamed, \\" You should get the hell outta there if he drinks this much\\"    The first thing it does is to tell women that they are the lesser in the relationship, so according to this book, you can't ask a guy out,  so you need to sit around and wait for him to ask you out and if he dosn't ask you out, it automatically means he dosn't like you. I think this is wrong. I don't know how many of my male friends are scared to death of rejection and and find it burdensome to always have to be the one who are asking. Some men are very shy, some men have no idea you might have feelings for them, especially if they are much older or much younger or not your type.     There is the chapter--he's not that into you if he's not having sex with you--Sex does not a relationship make--in this day and age, with casual sex, \\"booty calls\\" and friends with benefits, just because a guy wants have sex with you, does not mean he is totally into you or even wants you for a girlfriend.    There is another chapter--He's not that into you if he's not asking you to marry him. This chapter bugs me on a couple levels. First, we live in the 21st century--not everyone male or female actually wants to get married, this chapter says that men don't get married because they are not financially ready for marriage--it does even touch on female financial independence, or that many men find that attractive. Marriage is a partnership and a legal and emotional contract  that should not be entered upon lightly. This book makes getting married sound so simple.    Maybe one reason 21st century men don't want to get married has less to do with thier own financial independence, but more with the financial capabilities of thier future spouse. Many men today fear the financial implications of divorce and having to pull the weight of being the breadwinner--also a fear for many financially secure woman. In this day and age working women no one wants to be taking to the cleaners--I think the reason a man or a woman who not want to marry has many more levels then just him not being into you--also, who says the woman can't do the asking anyway?
0812975219|4.0|I think some of the reviewers didn't read the preface. This author states that he wrote the book as though he were having a conversation with the reader. Hence he refers to himself a lot. The rest can be taken as someone telling you a funny story, which might seem biting to some. I think the reviewers that had a lot of ad hominem arguments against the book are the very same people who would talk the same way in conversation. Opinionated people tend to hate other opinionated people.     That being said, I think there is a lot of good information in this book for someone with no exposure to the concepts. Hence there is a lot of explanatory material to get the novice up to speed. Some reviewers called this \\"fluff.\\" I found it very helpful. I did think there was a lot of digression, which is okay in conversation, but difficult to keep track of over the course of reading the whole book, so I gave it 4 stars.     This book has made me more interested in this topic. Previously I had some frustrations in some business situations, with no way to quantify what was making me edgy about new processes or practices. Now I am more oriented in those situations and can make more informed critiques or decisions. Very helpful. I will get other books by this author, as well as The Halo Effect, based on this gentle introduction to the subject.

1401201911|5.0|How do you craft an original, startling take on an iconic character?  Ask Mark Millar (Ultimates, Wanted) as he offers this Elseworlds tale starring not just Superman, but the whole DC universe.  What if Kal-El's space ship had landed in communist, Stalin-led Russia instead of Smallville, Kansas?  That's what happens in Red Son, as the Man of Steel is raised behind the Iron Curtain as Russia's greatest hero, symbol, weapon, and eventually, leader.  Opposing Superman is the brilliant American Lex Luthor, who has disconnected himself from his wife Lois Lane in an effort to clone Superman, and outduel him.  There's more, so much more, going on in Red Son that you'll be amazed how Millar weaves everything together so seamlessly.  Other DC characters, including Wonder Woman, Brainiac, Bizarro, and Jimmy Olsen, are here as well, along with some very interesting takes on Batman and Green Lantern Hal Jordan.  The finale of Red Son is the crowning moment however, as everything comes full circle like one couldn't imagine.  The artwork from pencilers Dave Johnson and Killian Plunkett, and inkers Andrew Robinson and Walden Wong, is easy on the eyes as well, and is wonderfully detailed as well.  All in all, Red Son is by far one of the best Superman stories to see the light of day in recent memory, and should be checked out regardless of whether or not you are a Superman fan/reader or not.
B00005NB8K|5.0|For those of us who grew up in the 1960s, this is a wonderful film.  It genuinely evokes the sense of newness and possibility of that time, that all old forms could be swept away, that we could live love and rock and not worry about the future.  Of course we were wrong, and those who embodied all the hope and excess, like Morrison, paid the price with their lives - they were drunk, drugged out, and many eventually died of it.<br /><br />Looking back on it, I feel amazed at how naive we were, how arrogant, but then, we were children and youths, affluent and feeling that the possibilities literally were limitless.  This film accurately portrays that feeling, both in its pathetic over-reaching, but also a lot of the beauty of it.<br /><br />This is the best Stone film by far, and I wasn't even into the Doors.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.

B000WCBPOG|3.0|The movie is weirdly entertaining, but what convinced me to buy the soundtrack was Joe cocker's performance of Come Together. He proves, once again, that he is the finest interpreter of the Beatles' catalog on the planet. I'd love to see him come out with a CD composed entirely of Beatles' songs he's not done yet. There is surely more of a market for that than for Rod Stewart killing another Great American Songbook sampler. I'd start with While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and go from there.

B000V86OKG|5.0|This season has Dexter Morgan crossing paths with Lila Turney, the woman who understands him like no one else -- but that's not really a good thing.  For anyone.  She's definitely not the kind of person who makes an old reprobate say: \\"You make me want to be a better man.\\"  Sometimes, two wrongs don't make a right.<br /><br />Meanwhile those bodies so carefully disposed of in Season 1 are discovered, leading the cops closer and closer to Dexter.  There's an \\"Out of Time\\"* feel to this season that's quite enjoyable.  He seems teetering on the edge of getting caught only to seem to avoid detection yet again.  Great suspense on that level.<br /><br />The writers are also guiding Dexter to more and more nuanced and human emotions this season, particularly in his relationship with Rita.  They seem to be leading him to some sort of normality.  A recovering serial killer by season 3?  Anything is possible!<br /><br />*  Pretty good 2004 flick starring Denzel Washington and a totally hot Eva Mendes set, in all places, in Southern Florida.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|A great story from Miyazaki!
B00000JMOJ|2.0|This is a pretty run of the mill formula flick, with nothing whatsoever to add to the genre of dystopias that are fragile enough to be destroyed by a single toughie.  While I admit that I used to enjoy these films for the action and explosive violence as a kid, I have seen so many as an adult that they bore me to no end.  Arnold isn't so bad, it is just that the story is unbelievably banal.<br /><br />Not recommended, unless you want to waste 2 hours, which at times is exactly what I would want to do, that is, with a good movie.
B00132D808|2.0|If you expect this album to continue the style of \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out,\\" you will be sadly disappointed. There are a few songs where Beatle, Queen, Jellyfish, and ELO influences can be heard (like in \\"We're So Starving,\\" \\"Nine in the Afternoon,\\" and \\"When the Day Met the Night\\").    However, the album doesn't carry this theme throughout. Everything is very slow, there isn't a synth ANYWHERE to be found (if you were expecting that to carry over from \\"A Fever,\\" don't even buy this album), and the strings are nice, but ultimately are inserted in places where they are unnecessary. It just lacks intensity. Much of the album (especially tracks 3-5, 9-11, and 13-15) sounds like cookie-cutter pop.    Overall, it's not worth it for the 4 or 5 songs that are decent. It is different than \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out,\\" and it's not bad because of that, it's just not very good as it's own work. After a while, the songs run together. There is nothing unique about \\"Pretty. Odd.\\"
B000ZN802W|4.0|Beautifully photographed. Well-acted.  A little too long with some pretty slow sections.  I personally felt little sympathy for McCandless - every bad thing that happened to him was his own fault.   But others might watch this film and feel quite differently.  How you feel about the character probably reveals a lot about your own value system.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter Morgan is your typical blood-spatter expert and serial killer, working out unresolved family issues -- difficult siblings and abandonment by parents, one of whom was chain-sawed to death.  He's emotionally detached, which is to be expected for a serial killer I suppose, but he's trying to connect by pretending to be normal and by killing only really bad guys.<br /><br />Showtime has got a great mix of humor and dismemberment in this series.  It's a can't miss!

0525950079|3.0|I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth many years ago, and I was surprised and thrilled when I heard that Follett had finally penned a sequel.  Now that I'm approximately halfway through, I think I've read enough to have formed an opinion.    I disagree with the reviewers who don't feel that Follett makes you care for his characters.  I care.  While I don't think the story is as compelling as that of Pillars, and while there is an occasional sense of the characters having been recycled, all-in-all it's an entertaining story with interesting -- which is not to say historically plausible -- characters.    The criticisms of the history geeks do ring true in certain respects; Follet isn't about to let historical accuracy interfere with the story, and his main characters display a host of modern attitudes that seem out of place in the period.  That understandably infuriates the history nuts; thus the title of my review.  But readers who aren't committed history geeks should still be able to enjoy the story.      I also think that the critics' attacks on Follett's use of language go way too far.  It's true that he uses many words and phrases that weren't in existence in fourteenth century England.  But then if he had limited himself to words and phrases exant in fourteenth century England, the text of World Without End would look something like this:    Thanne longen folk to goon on pilgrimages   And palmeres for to seken straunge strondes   To ferne halwes, kowthe in sondry londes;     Since Follett obviously couldn't write his novel in Middle English (at least not if he wanted it to sell), it's neither surprising nor disturbing that he chose to have his characters speak in words and phrases that his modern audience would find natural and easily understood.  So, for example, even if the f-word wasn't in use at the time, there was certainly some equivalent, vulgar term for intercourse.  But since that equivalent would likely sound awkward and unfamiliar to modern readers, and would thus distract from the story, it's reasonable for Follett to use the more natural-sounding modern equivalent.  This preserves tone and meaning at the expense of slavish fidelity to Middle English.  That's not bad writing; it's *good* writing!

B000OQF6N6|5.0|I am so sick of these so called 'pumpkin fans', complaining and whining that this isnt the real Smashing Pumpkins. I am so over it. If these people really knew their stuff they would know D'Arcy and James barely played on some of their biggest material. Even so, they were an important part of the band, but the Pumpkins are back, and thats all that really REALLY matters.<br />D'Arcy and James were the people that broke the band up, so the fact they are gone doesnt bother me at all..<br /><br />Now to the album.<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" can be a mixed bag. At first listen, I didnt enjoy the album a huge lot. I really enjoyed the diverse sound of the Pumpkins that they created with \\"Siamese Dream\\", \\"Mellon Collie\\" and \\"Adore\\".<br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" isnt the most diverse album they have made. But it is a good listen, and I really mean that.<br />I saw the Pumpkins live last night in Christchurch, New Zealand and their \\"Zeitgeist\\" material was absolutely phenomenal. It sounded rocking, awesome and simply gave me a new appreciation for this album.<br />The best tracks here are:<br />Doomsday Clock, Tarantula, Come on (Lets Go!), Neverlost, Bring The Light, That's the Way (My Love Is), Pomp and Circumstance and Bleeding The Orchid.<br /><br />I really like all these tracks with my favourites being 'Bring The Light' ,'Doomsday Clock' and 'Tarantula' which are AMAZING live!<br />I am so glad the Pumpkins are back and this album, while not the best in their collection (by far), is a great listen and a really cool sounding album to kick off their new era! So stop complaining and whining because the Smashing Pumpkins are back!!!<br />4½ stars.<br /><br />Oh, and if you can get the \\"Zeitgeist\\" Deluxe Edition with the grey cover, it has awesome bonus tracks, my favourite being \\"Zeitgeist\\", the title track which is a cool acoustic track. OH and pick up \\"American Gothic\\", the EP, its an acoustic EP which proves the Pumpkins really havent gone anywhere or 'sold out'.
B000002B35|5.0|The performance of the entire Dark Side of the Moon album alone makes this worth it.  Many songs from the Division Bell make a showing here with a few from The Wall and \\"Learning to Fly\\" from A Momentary Lapse of Reason.    All in all, an excellent concert.

B000K7VHSM|5.0|This is a truly touching and moving presentation. It also perfectly captures the 60's when this sort of romance would have unfolded exactly as presented on the screen. The only problem is that same sex relationships, however romanticized, are doomed as was this one. Its brilliant portrayals and casting create an exquisitely overwhelming romantic fantasy!
B00011RPB0|1.0|I join at least 550 other Amazon reviewers who found this movie boring and somewhat offensive. In outline, the concept is not bad - two strangers who meet in a strange country, feeling alientated - but the execution leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />It's clear that Sofia Coppola has gone to the European School of Prententious Filmmaking, where \\"art\\" is supposedly conveyed by long, empty silences and people staring impassively at the camera. The vapid Ms. Johansson, with her painfully unformed and Nordic impassivity, fits the bill to a T. The problem is when these \\"meaningful silences\\" aren't really meaningful. Rather than \\"art\\", Coppola's scenes of silence tell me she ran out of things to say.<br /><br />It's also clear how Coppola regards people who aren't European. Making fun of Japanese people, lampooning them in this film, really put me off. The comic bits of the film derives solely from Bill Murray doing a whisky commercial over and over. The point of this comedy is: \\"Aren't Japanese people funny? Aren't they weird and bizarre?\\"<br /><br />No, they're human beings. Tolerance and trying to understand another culture (and failing) isn't the point of the film - rather, it's about how justified two spoiled and vapid people feel about being alienated. The film would have been far more interesting if Murray and Johnasson had tried to communicate with the foreign culture around them, and failed. But in Coppola's film, they don't even bother trying. The characters are only there for the money (in Murray's case) or because they've been dumped there (Johnasson). Japan is a fascinating country, but you'd never know it watching this film.<br /><br />Instead of \\"Lost in Translation,\\" Coppola should have called it \\"Lost in Themselves.\\"
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is a MOST interesting concept for a TV series.  I've watched the first 7 episodes and can't wait to see the other 5.  Very intersting twists with almost every scene.  Cinemetography is outstanding!

B000WGNLLW|3.0|It's hard for me to be objective of Duran Duran, but I'll try. I'm a big DD fan and have been since the 80s. I've followed what they've done through the years. I was very happy to purchase their Astronaut CD and was thrilled with the reunion.    Now after waiting several years for this new CD and expecting the worst (I'm not a Timberlake/Timbaland fan at all), I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised. Most of the tunes are very catchy with wonderful vocals, which is what I like. At the same time, however, I am disappointed because I believe their sound is muddied and they are trying too hard to be something they're not.    DD are inventive. Part of their charm in the 80s was the fact that they didn't sound like anyone else to me. Some of that is gone with this disc, at least for the first half. They pretty much sound like everything else out there. The only original sound is the vocals. If you substituted Simon's vocals with someone else's (Timberlake?), you wouldn't know it is Duran at all. It isn't until after Skin Divers that they start to pull it together.    I think Duran has a lot of talent, but they need to focus on who they are and what makes them legends. They don't have to go back in time and recreate the same old either. Simon LeBon commented in an interview that Duran Duran likes to experiment with new sounds. Yes, these sounds are new--for them, but the market is saturated with this.      All in all, the CD is worth a listen and is very danceable.
1932907009|5.0|Wanting to get into screenwriting, or at least to write scripts simply for my own amusement, naturally I have been reading screenwriting books. This is the greatest that I have come across by far. Blake Snyder helps you to take your idea, and mould it into a workable form. Or, makes you realize it wasn't meant to be a screenplay in the first place. Practical advice from a person who has clearly been there and done that several times over, the book helped me to see where to start the screenwriting process, which is what several books do, but then unlike other books on the topic, it kind of hand holds you through the process, which is what a beginner like me truly needed.  I thought the subtitle on the cover 'The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll ever need' was a little boastful, until I read the contents. Highly recommended, and at the price, well, aspiring screenwriters can hardly go wrong.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Death At A Funeral is the funniest movie I've enjoyed in a long time.  Although the title may indicate it to be a maudlin type of movie, it is  anything but.  The actors, while not a well known group of people, excel at their character roles.  It is a bit of British humor that had every American in the theatre, where I first viewed it, and everyone at home viewing the DVD in histerical laughter.  Even the credits are hilarious.
B000007NZ5|4.0|I picked this album up around the time that I got TYR and at first I wasn't fond the album.  It had two tracks I liked...  Headless Cross and Devil and Daughter.  I listened to it on occasion but recently found myself listening to the entire album and loving every track years later.  Top to bottom this album is great.      And nowadays the lyrics to some songs might seem \\"corny\\" or \\"over the top\\" but this is an Occult style album which is much different that some of the other previous Sabbath releases.  A much more darker, version of Sabbath.  Which is why I love the Martin era of Sabbath so much.  To me, at some point Sabbath got away from being what the name represented and what the music was supposed to be about.      This album along with various tracks from TYR to me saw Sabbath going back to \\"the basics\\" so to speak.  Going back to the lyrics, I can see how people would think the \\"satan\\" references would be silly, but compare it to the rest of the music that was out at the time.  They pretty much started a movement for the music we hear of this type now.  This was revolutionary stuff and while Rock and Roll was always considered \\"evil\\" by purists and such, and while people always looked for Occult messages in music, Sabbath laid the cards out on the table and effectively said \\"here's your evil Occult music!  Swallow this bitter pill!\\"
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali is an amazing woman.  For the first time in a long time, I was so proud to be a woman after reading a book, just because she's done such inspiring things with her life.  The book highlights gender differences in the Muslim world, but it should resonate with any woman who is faced with the day-to-day struggles of adulthood.  I would recommend this to anyone but most especially to young women.  This is an author who can serve as a role model to us all.
B00005B6C9|5.0|I have to give this 5 stars because it blew me away. I have only recently rediscovered the Bee Gees having liked them mainly during the 70s. Where was I when this CD came out? I must have been in my own little world, but I am so glad I found it now.     I listened to it uninterrupted on my Ipod in bed and each track just reconfirmed to me that these guys are great songwriters and this is how it is done (unlike most music written today). I love their harmonies and at one point was even moved to tears just by the shear beauty of them. One reviewer said there isn't enough of the harmonies, but I think they are inserted where they are needed to give the most impact to the delivery of the songs (hence the tears). The opening track, This is Where I Came In is a great opener and builds to a catchy chorus that makes you want to join in.    Another favorite is Sacred Trust. Just when you think it's going to unremarkable and smaltzy (is that a word), the beautiful refrain comes in. These are songs that stick in your head after just one listen. That's a GOOD thing.    I was also pleased to hear Maurice. I've never heard him sing lead and was very pleasantly surprised.     I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes pop, and well-crafted songs. They carry a lot of emotion and maturity. Again, that is a good thing. It is sad that this is their last original recording.

B00132D808|5.0|\\"Pretty.  Odd.\\" represents a quantum leap forward for Panic at the Disco.  Not unlike the Rolling Stones did with \\"Their Satanic Majesty's Request,\\" Panic has attempted to emulate The Beatles' classic \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" and in doing so has delivered a shimmering collection of orchestral pop gems.  Like the Stones' album, though, \\"Pretty.  Odd.\\" already has a legion of detractors who apparently wanted a retread of Panic's first album.  But to the band's immense credit, they not only have the musical chops to pull off the album, but they have the balls to deliver it to a fanbase who are likely to dismiss it.  Nothing out right now sounds like this -- their chart topping peers lack the sophisticated orchestration and production, and the lesser known artists aping the styles of The Beatles and ELO often lack the sheer energy that infuses those classic records.    If you don't like Panic, this is the album that will change your mind.  If you do, listen with an open mind and you'll realize that Pete Wentz's proteges have the potential to be the most unexpectedly great band of the year.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Enough people have already expounded the virtues of this excellent documentary.  If they haven't sung its praises, they're part of the insurance industry's puppeteers.  Without your health, you have NOTHING!  I lived in Canada and their system is far better than ours.<br /><br />It's what I found in the EXTRA'S section of this DVD that was even more amazing to me, when it comes to a healthy society living in harmony with mother earth and all of its inhabitants.  I'm referring to the much talked about prison population here in the United States, compared to other countries larger in size and larger population than ours.  Their knee jerk response isn't to lock people up.<br /><br />Here, we're stuck in a rut.  We keep building more prisons to house the disadvantaged, while the privileged corporate criminals get a fine, a little better than a slap on the wrist given how much money they earn.  White collar criminals steal millions from ordinary citizens and for the most part, don't do the time.<br /><br />Compare and contrast how Norway deals with their prison population.  It's so amazing, had I not seen it on film, I never could have imagined such a wise justice system.  They must be doing everything right since recidivism is practically non-existent.  In Norway they don't punish the relatives nor break up the families with additional stress.  They see their law breakers as being weak or sick and offer treatment instead of punishment.<br /><br />So after you've bought this DVD, check out the Extras and be sure to watch \\"This Country Beats France.\\"
B000NA2BEU|5.0|It was a tragedy when Veronica Mars was cancelled by the CW last year.  During it's brief 3 year run it was one of the best written, well-acted, plot coordinated shows ever.  I have to admit that while season three was running I thought the quality had diminished a little. But watching the whole season's episodes consecutively in a short span of time has changed my mind.  There is a wealth of new characters introduced that one doesn't appreciate unless watching the episodes in a short time frame.    Among the extra features are:  About 12 minutes of clips that were pitched for a Season 4 but never picked up. It's a tease, but only makes the loss of the show harder.  There are also some interesting featurettes with Rob Thomas that are worthwhile and deleted scenes and gag reel.  Overall an enjoyable package and a must for Veronica Mars completists.

B0000041WM|5.0|All the praise given to June Anderson is deserving.  Although both Nucci and Pavarotti are quite strong in their respective roles, the year when this was recorded--in my humble opinion--was the American soprano's peak year.  She just was at the hight of her power in 1989, and this recording captures it.  Her voice is a rare dramatic coloratura: she has the richness of tone in that of a dramatic soprano combined with the high notes and flexibility of a coloratura soprano.  She sounds powerful, yet feminine and in the character of Gilda.      After listening to this recording, you will surely want to hear more of her.  I would suggest her dazzling recording of \\"La Fille du Regiment\\" opposite Alfredo Kraus.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I've been looking for the past several years for a deeply affecting and really excellent horror film, and this is it. Films like JOHN CARPENTER'S THE THING and David Cronenberg's remake of THE FLY are about as great as you can get, because not only are they excellent horror films with taut and terrifying moments, they transcend the genre itself. Where Carpenter's THE THING is at its heart a story of utter paranoia and distrust and Cronenberg's THE FLY is a star-crossed love story set against the backdrop of the over-extension of man's reach, Frank Darabont's THE MIST is about how easily and quickly society can break down to its basest and ugliest forms when confronted with a seemingly apocalyptic threat.<br /><br />Thomas Jane (in what should have been a star-making role) plays David Drayton, a mild-mannered artist in a coastal Maine town who finds himself as the voice of reason when an eerie mist blows into town which may or may not be concealing an army of preternatural forces, trapping a small but substantial section of the townspeople in the local supermarket. He, along with his young son Billy (a nicely-cast Nathan Gamble) a pretty young schoolteacher Amanda (played beautifully by Laurie Holden) and a wonderfully crotchety old lady (played by Frances Sternhagen), along with a few others, are trying to hold their ground and their grip on an already-tenuous situation against local Bible-thumping lunatic Mrs. Carmody (played a little too over-the-top by the usually understated Marcia Gay Harden) who is using some unusual coincidences to prove that this attack is the wrath of God, and using the other townspeople's fear to cause a threat within the store that rivals the threat from without.<br /><br />It's easy to dismiss this film as simple escapism, but it is so much more. Great performances by Jane, Holden, Sternhagen and supporting players Andre Braugher and William Sadler put this film above the recent flurry of classic horror remakes, watered-down Japanese-to-American retcons and the \\"torture porn\\" sub-genre that have been masquerading as horror films, and it does so with great writing, great effects, great direction and the single most disturbing ending of a film since David Fincher's SE7EN.<br /><br />The last horror film that I saw that seemed truly original and terrifying and iconic was Victor Salva's JEEPERS CREEPERS. While this film may not be quite as visceral as that, it's still been five years since that film came out and since then, for the most part, Hollywood has been cranking out films like THE RING, THE GRUDGE, remakes of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, HALLOWEEN and THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and the ad nauseam SAW series and its fellow torturers HOSTEL and TURISTAS. Every so often, a terrific little indie horror gem like Lucky Mckee's MAY or John Fawcett's GINGER SNAPS will pop up, but that's all they do. THE MIST is the only horror film to come out of Hollywood in the last 5 years that has had any lasting effect on me, like the great horror films of the 70's like HALLOWEEN, THE EXORCIST, THE OMEN, or some of the greats of the 80's like THE THING, THE FLY or NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. All of these films transcend the genre as THE MIST does, and it really seems like this is a dying breed of horror film when this film does half the business of lesser recent entries like I AM LEGEND, or 30 DAYS OF NIGHT, where, while decent films, are hardly the films that are likely to keep you up nights haunting you. THE MIST will either haunt you or anger you, but it will provoke debate, especially with an ending that may be on the level of nihilism that rivals that of Romero's original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.<br /><br />For my money, this was one of the very best films of last year, and I can only hope that in the future, this is a film that will be revisited and rediscovered as many of the now-classic horror films have been.ns and the \\"torture porn\\" sub-genre that have been masquerading as horror films, and it does so with great writing, great effects, great direction and the single most disturbing ending of a film since David Fincher's SE7EN.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|I didn't really think the quality could be improved on an older film like this, but this dvd is amazing. Its like a brand new movie. Crisp picture and beautiful sound.
B000VZIP5Q|5.0|Olivia Newton-John really knows how to kick out the jams. This album is excellent. Something to really enjoy.
B000XU8I5G|5.0|God, I love the Hives. Rock lives, and its name is the Hives. Attitude, loud guitars, vocals that are pushed to the limits (and often beyond) the capabilities of the vocalist, clever arrangements... the Hives are Rock.     The Black and White Album is a bit on the Pop side compared to previous Hives outings, but don't let that shake you, this is still a rock band. The songs that lack the ferocity of Tyrannosaurus Hives and Vini Vidi are viindicated by clever orchestration of respective instruments and the sharp wit of the swedes.     There is the issue of \\"A Stroll Through Hive Manor Corridors\\" however... I tend to skip this track, because it sort of cripples the momentum of the album. This would have been an excellent candidate for an end-of-the-album-hidden-track. If I hadn't seen a name and track listed I wouldn't have expected anything, but it was and I did and it just doesn't deliver.  However, as the only low point on the album... well, I guess I can deal with it.    The Hives: know them, love them, buy them.
B0012X6FT4|4.0|I'll only comment on the concert recording.Good,sometimes suprising seperation and arrangments.The band sound like they just discovered, or were slipped some speed.Almost worth buying for people who have both US and import LP's and 3 different Cd versions already. Man, its starting to suck being middle class.

B00005JPLW|5.0|Alright, we have gorgeous men in little shorts getting sweaty and killing the enemy!  What more could you want!
B00132D808|3.0|This is a huge departure from the last record. Although change is never necessarily a bad thing, in this particular situation I believe it is. I can definately say that I enjoy a good majority of the songs on the album but they all tend to have the same happy-poppy-beatles type of feel and I eventually realize that I'm not even paying attention to a lot of the lyrics and/ or music after a short while. In summary, I am just going to miss some of the fast-paced intensity and use of synth from the last album. There's nothing on here that has a remote resemblence to Camisado, Time to Dance, or The Only Difference, all of which I could throw on the ipod and listen to during a good work out. To me, this is layed back leisure/ coffee house/ sun-bathing music (Ya, odd description I know).
B0012K1ILW|1.0|Uniqueness is an added feature that is lacking in today's music selections.  Me like oh so many have been patiently waiting for Ms. Badu to drop a new album . \\"Honey \\" , the 9th Wonder produced track is hot, there is quality sound coming from my cd player again it's Erykah back from her industry break.<br /><br /> Within a few weeks I like so many others patiently waited for her cd to drop. The day finally arrives , I couldn't get to the record store any faster. I rushed home to play it. Popped the cd in my cd player , and the noise was begining to hurt my ears. I wanted to cry , where has the feel and quality of Ms. Badu's work gone . Word has it she's dropping part 2 of this cd within a new months of this noise . Oh No , please say it isn't so .<br /><br />There is a huge difference from being creative to just disappointing . As much talent as this woman has or had on her first four cds. Where did she go ? She followed Lauryn Hill to \\"Lostville\\".

0451529065|5.0|The readers with some science background will not only be amazed, but also charmed by this work.  Any lingering doubt about the extent of Darwin's field and bench research will dissolve after seeing the enormous amount of biological observation this man accomplished.  The small fraction of such observations he chose to include in \\"Origin\\" are responsible for the book's length, but serve as thorough, but lovely, illustrations  to the development of his theory of natural selection.  Those with less science background can ask readers with more science learning about the accuracy of the above statement.  In any case, how Darwin \\"connected the dots\\" midway throughout the 19th century is nothing short of astonishing.    You must keep in mind as you read through this book that the science of genetics, inheritance, geological plate tectonics, and atomic nuclear structure were unknown at Darwin's time.  Even more unknown were various molecular biosciences of the later 20th century.  Nevertheless Darwin, the amateur scientist, put the mental pieces for natural selection together from his own vast research and other known science of the times such as geology, paleontology, embryology, etc.  In the introduction of \\"Origin\\" Darwin outlines the four basic statements of natural selection in simple terms - as are most scientific theories.      A myth easily put to rest while reading \\"Origin\\" is that the author was a man reluctant to do battle with his opponents and skeptics.  Not so.  One finishes the book having seen dozens of passages openly challenging all comers on one point or another!  Remembering that Charles Darwin was a Victorian gentleman (in the very best sense:  love of learning, seeking truths, persistence, striving), it becomes clear why he inherently would think that natural selection would be a process of improvement, and would take very long amounts of time.  This was part of the Victorian ethic.  He said in his book that natural selection was an unthinking, undirected, unmotivated process, but in his heart he clearly liked the \\"improvement\\" thought.  This should be a small concession to a real genius.
006051048X|4.0|I listen to books on cd while in my car, and I've found that the ones read by the author are the best. (Not all the time, mind you.) The author knows how he or she intended the characters to sound and the words to be pronounced.  In the case of Coraline, Neil Gaiman is spot on!  He's got a very nice voice, and adds a subtle creepy tone to the already creepy story.  Nice!
076780421X|5.0|I love this movie. I can't even count how many times I have watched this movie  on tv. So I decided that it was time to own it. I was very so happy with the condition of the dvd and how fast it arrived at my home.  If your in the mood for a feel good movie, go for this one! A+ seller
0810993139|5.0|This book is the best for boy reluctant readers. My son who is 9 read this book with enthusiasm. It was the first book he read with gusto and enjoyment. He could not put it down. The style of the book with \\"hand printed type\\" and cartoon sketches breaks the page, making it easier to read and less overwhelming for slower readers. A definite recommendation for any 4th to 7th grader. It is very funny.
0061142026|3.0|Not what I would consider an amazing book. I would suggest you borrow it, but now buy it. Not something I'll read through a second time.
B000VWE5OY|4.0|Torchwood comes from the creators of the recent Doctor Who revival (and writer / creator of the UK's Queer As Folk). Torchwood is actually an anagram of Doctor Who, for those that are interested.    Like most new shows, this first season takes a little time to find it's feet, to get you caring about the characters and feeling 'in-tune' with what it's all about. However, as first seasons go, the team have done a great job. John Barrowman smoulders his way through each episode looking fantastic but much screen time is devoted to the supporting cast members and it certainly is not a 'one-man' show.    Yes, the show deals with aliens, monsters and general threats to humankind (both real and perceived) as you would expect, however what keeps it interesting is that the worst aspects are generally related to more human emotions. Some episodes are quite dark, dealing with the worst of human frailties; jealousy, guilt, anger and obsession all wrapped up in a sexy, flirting undercurrent of repressed (and unrepressed) desire.    John Barrowman is outstanding and breaks the mould for the handsome hero/protagonist in every way possible - from his unashamed open multi-sexuality, through a 007-like callousness, to a softer caring side. Yet still he leaves tyou with an air of mystery and detachment to allow for some slow reveals as the season progresses.    This is an adult show and definitely not for the kids. It is really targeting those who have grown up with Doctor Who but want something more dangerous and sexy from their shows. Not unexpectedly some previously taboo areas are covered; lesbianism, gay and bisexual behaviour, but all dealt with in a measured and humourous way.    Two of the best episodes - \\"They keep killing Suzie\\" and \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\" really showcase the cast's talents and the real potential of this show. I'm looking forward to Season 2 to see if they can keep up the momentum.
0060885378|5.0|Reading this book was was very easy for me to imagine life back when cards didn't exist and people's nearest neighbor was 1-2 miles away. Wholesome fun for a family that truely survived on what nature had to offer them. Great reading for the family.
B00132D808|5.0|Wow. That is what I have to say about this album. It's the first time I've ever woken up early to purchase a CD and boy was it worth it. Pretty. Odd. sounds fresh and classic at the same time. I liked their last album, but what a step up. This album has to be one of my favorites of all time.

0321344758|4.0|Everyone in our IT department that has anything to do with our products SDLC had to read this book.  At first I was a little reluctant since it was \\"required\\", however, the book is a very good read.  It was easy to understand and a pretty quick read.  The author used plain English and broke down anything that might be new to the \\"usability newbie\\".  If you are looking for a book to get you started trying to do a little usability testing yourself, then this book is for you.  However, if you have some usability experience - this book is probably a little too elementary for you.
0767020308|3.0|Kate Beckinsale made a lovely Emma, much better than Gwen Paltrow, however, I still prefer the theatrical film better. It just seemed less stiff and less formal. Emma is not as serious as some of the other novels and I though the A&E version was heading more in that direction. The actual picture quality is very poor and grainy, very dark looking. Again, its hard not to compare the 2 versions. I did like the portrayal of Jane Fairfax in this version better than in the other version. She just seemed more interesting and mysterious here. I barely noticed the musical score, it didn't stand out at all. The costumes were nice to look at and the locations were pretty. Also, as a side note, it was nice to notice that Emma's house is the same mansion they used as Mr  Jennings's house in Sense and Sensibility, my favorite Jane Austen film.
B00132D808|1.0|This had got to be the biggest debacle of the year. I am not sure what they were trying to do, but for a sophomore album this is a bust. Whoever at their record company let this one get out should be fired for letting them ruin their sound. Panic at the Disco went from one of my favorite bands to I just liked their first album.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|Mostly because of the unceremonious ending and my decade old love affair with the show, I had high expectations for the film that would come to be called \\"The Ark of Truth.\\" Maybe they were too high. It could also be that after 10+ years of watching 60-90 minute episodes that I became too familiar with the format and a full length film didn't fit the mold I'd created in my head.    Regardless, I was ultimately disappointed. I felt that even though the film was made for fans like me, it jumped into the story too quickly. It made the literary mistake of telling and instead of showing. The quick transitions in the storyline assumed that the watcher had the knowledge to fill in the blank and while we may have, it still made for a jumpy film that had a lot of holes in it.    I had hoped that given the time they had we would see the writers produce a very good script, but overall the writing was not a sharp as some of the better episodes of the show. It wasn't nearly as snappy and quick witted and lacked some of the subtle poignant statements made throughout the series. I was especially disappointed that the few Bondesque one liners we got from Mitchell were mostly mediocre. Also, as a longtime fan I'd hoped to see more inside references (see Episode 200) that the die-hard fans could truly appreciate, but that wouldn't lose the casual fan.    The reemergence of the replicators, I feel, prevented the conclusion of the Ori storyline from being as deep and smooth as it could have been. It smacked of the writers running out of material to put it, but I feel that had they taken more time to tell the story thoroughly, this would not have been a problem.    Ultimately, I was glad to have the chance to buy the DVD and show my support for the franchise and it was nice to have the series finally wrapped up, but I think they could have done a much better job. I gave it three stars above, but 2.5 would be more accurate.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This movie really touched me.  I think the acting was superb, and the story line was very moving.  At first, I was reticent to watch it because of the two men thing, but I got beyond that and saw it simply as a love story between two people who, due to societal circumstances, could not share their lives together.  The best part, I think, was seeing how they gradually fell in love and then to see the passion of that love.  I liked it so much, that I ended up buying the DVD.
0743496736|5.0|Wow,  This is a novel that should be read by all teen and adults, professional and novice alike.  As a person that was bullied all through elementary school, junior high and high school I really lived through the scenes in this novel.  Although I am a female and my experiences were not like Peter's I have had the pain of what isolation gives a child and a teenager.  I also have been on the side watching someone be bullied by somebody else and not doing anything about it for fear of having that attention being put on me next. It isn't fun and life is very scary when you have to go to school 37 hours a week Monday to Friday.  I since grew up and am a 39 year old married lady with children of my own but those dark hours have shaped who I am today.  I dont know if bullies know the pain that they inflict on thier targets.  What happened in this novel is something grabbed from the headlines and luckily me and many others that have been bullied out there were confident enough to carry on and grow and learn and not seek revenge unlike Peter in this novel.  I think if every kid and teen and adult read this maybe there would be more understanding to this problem today and how we can effectively deal with it.  Anyways A great read.  Very real and you will love the characters like your own family and friends. You will see the court room and smell the fear and witness the court room experience right down to the gavel.  :)
0671801511|5.0|I'm approx. halfway through reading the complete works of Agatha Christie, and so far I have to say this book has been the most different from the rest of her mysteries. It was spooky to me, and a bit harder to figure out. Usually I have some suspicion of who the real murderer is, but this one got me. I didn't have a clue. There's a twisted sense of justice being served in this book, of a human who is putting himself in the judgment seat of God. I don't necessarily approve of those actions, but the book did make me think. It was riveting - I finished it in one evening. Didn't think I would like it as much since Christie's famous Poirot or Marple were not in it, but I really enjoyed it.

I was a little hesitant reading that it was only recommeded to use the mobile part of the crib till the baby is 5 months old we decided to go ahead and get it (our baby was 4 months at the time). Well Noah is now 8 months old and we are still using the entire mobile on this crib. He loves watching it and I love the different selections of music and nature sounds. Also I love the fact that once the baby is older and pulling up etc. that you can just remove the mobile section and use the musical base to help soothe. You can't go wrong. I wish we had found this when he was a newborn.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corrine Bailey Rae's debut disc is one of the best albums I've ever heard or listened to and definitely one of the top albums in my collection.  With a voice so sweet coupled with hypnotizing backdrops and honest lyrics this album is a work of art, a masterpiece.  This is an album that grows on you and is more complete and satisfying then any \\"R&B\\" album in the last couple years.  I enjoy every song and every time I feel like relaxing or thinking or anything of the sort I instantly think of this album.  Corrine Bailey Rae created a magical journey with this cd seamlessly going through every human emotion.  Love, confusion, doubt, happiness etc.   Every song is great to me, no slips.  Undeniable grooves, amazing lyrics and a soothing voice makes this a classic for many years to come.

0525950079|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book as sexual acts seem to be the main focus.  If I had wanted to read porn, I would have bought porn.  I thought I was buying a work of historical fiction.  I think that the author took the easy way out to fill up pages and did not put the real work in for a good piece of literature.
0596007124|4.0|This book is fun.  More importantly, it really does \\"load the patterns [...] straight into your brain\\" with some concerted effort on the reader's part.  Once it all clicks (assuming you aren't a design pattern guru already), OOP is taken to the next level!  You just need to conceptually  map ducks, turkeys, pizzas, and waitresses to your particular situation.  Your APIs and apps will rock!

B000TX7B5U|5.0|For many years now, I have forsaken the radio in lieu of more intentional musical experiences.  Rather than tuning in to a station and allowing myself to submit to their playlists, I have instead followed my personal interests by looking at liner notes and Amazon's \\"suggested artists.\\"  However, there is nothing more satisfying than listening to the opinions of a person whose musical opinion you respect.  My reluctant affinity for Serj Tankian is an example of that rare album that presents itself as impenetrable, but reveals itself to be ingenious.<br /><br />One of my students (thanks, Steph) suggested that I check out Tankian because I liked the Foo Fighters' new release.  I was admittedly reluctant.  I knew he was involved with System of a Down, which I also \\"never got,\\" but I was in a bit of a rut for new music.  I bought it, listened to it once, and then put it away.  Initially, I had major problems with his vocal style, which I characterized as \\"sounding like he had six feet of gauze up each nostril.\\"<br /><br />My bad.<br /><br />In retrospect, this initial judgment was ridiculous.  First off, one of my favorite bands is Rush, so I am in no position to criticize \\"unique\\" vocals.  Secondly, Tankian's musical and lyric conception transcends his vocal approach.  Subsequent listenings made me appreciate the distinctively subtle, yet relevant, sociopolitical message of his personal musical production.<br /><br />\\"Elect the Dead\\" has become one of my favorite albums.  Aided by the readily available visual images available on the internet, I came to understand Tankian's particular brand of genius.  \\"Enlist the Dead\\" ingeniously relates his situation with no holds barred.  Simultaneously, he imbeds his ideology within well-crafted songs that require close inspection, both musically and lyrically, to fully understand.<br /><br />The Lowdown:  In a previous NIN review, I wondered about form that musical resistance might take in our contemporary landscape.  I find Tankian's songs to be wonderfully accessible and conceptually deep.  As a result I find them to be emotionally moving.

B000002UDB|4.0|With Sgt. Pepper's completed & released the Beatles were able to rest & take time to contemplate their next project. Paul McCartney had really stepped out in front of the group with  Sgt' Pepper's, he had almost always been the musical director of the group but now he was becoming the lead creative artist within the group. Magical Mystery Tour was even more a project of his own than had been Sgt. Pepper's.<br /><br />At this time McCartney decided what the Beatles needed to do next was a tv program for the BBC. Paul had always leaned toward the spontaneous, at least behind the scenes. The Beatles would go on a countryside tour on an adventure. The show itself would essentially be scriptless though the songs wouldn't be. The tv special would be a flop &, in many ways, some thought the album the same way. In reality, Magical Mystery Tour isn't an album. The first six songs are from that tv special (though there were others but not performed by the Beatles). In fact, Magical Mystery Tour was only available in Great Britain as an EP. The British didn't get the American version for many years. This American version included five more songs that were hits & had been previously released as singles.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", one of McCartney's best songs, somewhat reminiscent of \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\". \\"Fool on the Hill\\" follows, many consider this to be one of McCartney's best ballads. The next song is \\"Flying\\". This is the only Beatles instrumental ever released, it's also the only song that all four members of the band co-wrote together. George Harrison's \\"Blue Jay Way\\" is next. It's an odd little song. The next song is McCartney's \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" which hearkens back to the big band era that he grew up in. Paul seemed to come up with at least one song similar to this on almost every album the Beatles released. Lennon's only contribution to the album was the final song of the Magical Mystery Tour, \\"I Am the Walrus\\". This is one of his bestsongs. He wrote the lyrics when a friend had told him that a university was offering a class on finding the true meanings within the Beatles lyrics. What Lennon offered here was gobbledygook. He pieced together words that held no special meanings, yet they were loaded with imagery that would inspire some searching. Lennon would later explain he only wrote the lyrics to make someone think that there was a hidden meaning. This is an example of just how good a lyricist Lennon could be; he would dream up a complete line of drivel & make it seem extremely intelligent & thoughtful.<br /><br />Magical Mystery Tour, the album is fleshed out with five hits that had been previously released. Four of them had been major hits. The only one that wasn't a major hit was \\"Baby You're a Rich Man\\", a song that was really two different ones that Lennon & McCartney had pieced together. \\"Hello Goodbye\\" is here, one of McCartney's best songs. Both sides of a single are next: \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" (Lennon) & \\"Penny Lane\\" (McCartney). Both songs come from childhood memories of each writer. At this time they were considering releasing an album of songs based on their childhood memories but this was as far as it got. Strawberry Fields was actually a Salvation Army homeless shelter in Liverpool. The final song of the album is Lennon's \\"All You Need Is Love\\", one of his most famous & loved songs.<br /><br />Overall, Magical Mystery Tour is a great album; it misses the mark only because of a couple of songs from the tv special.
B0011HOEY4|3.0|During the entirety of \\"American Gangster\\", the story of legendary scumbag Frank Lucas who ran the Harlem Mafia for 20 years, I wanted Denzel Washington to stop acting princpled, gentlemanly, professional and revert to \\"Training Day\\" mode.  Nostalgia for his monstrously depraved, charismatic dirty cop hit me in waves, particularly when he was conversing with Russsell Crowe at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Altogether, this is less an attempt at an honest portrayal of what the brilliant drugdealer was like than an attempt to create a \\"black Godfather\\".  Lucas is not the guy for this and despite Denzel Washington's superb acting skills, one cannot turn a heroin dealer from the ghetto into Marlon Brando's Don Corleone with this cast lineup.  The supporting actors are not there and the film moves too fast from nightclub to nightclub, sporadic murder to murder, betrayal to betrayal.  Crowe's Richie Roberts, a cop who did what he was suppposed to do at a time very few others were, has said that this movie is only \\"20 percent\\" true. In Frank Lucas' own words: \\"They should have never made a movie about me.\\"<br /><br />Washington's Lucas is too evasive to really grab a hold of.  He is a bad dude, that much is clear: when a particularly nasty rival challenges him to shoot \\"in front of everybody\\" on a Harlem streetcorner, he obliges.  Washington's performance is so compelling that one wants to know more about Lucas--where did he come from, why did he end up with Bumpy Johnson, why is he such a tough guy, and what are his motives for even being in this business? But the flash and glitter of the film allow for no such answers.  What is clear is that Lucas is simply another capitalist in many ways.  When a rival by the name of Nikki Barnes cuts the purity of his infamous \\"Blue Magic\\" down for no apparent reason, Washington visits him and says: \\"Blue Magic\\" is like \\"Pepsi\\".  Okay?  I stand behind the product, and it's fast selling.\\"  Lucas may not even see what he's doing as evil.  It's simply the way he makes money and it's very successful.<br /><br />This is movie is basically a testoterone rush and as that it works very well. I'm still waiting for Alonzo to return in \\"Training Day II\\".the way he makes money and it's very successful.         This is movie is basically a testoterone rush and as that it works very well. I'm still waiting for Alonzo to return in \\"Training Day II\\".

0920668364|5.0|This is the second time I've purchased this book. I gave my first copy away to my stepson as a Father's Day gift. I know it says \\"Kid's Library\\", but I consider it just as essential for Grandma's Library. Only one caution. Read it to yourself before you read it to a child. It's a real tear-jerker if you don't know what's coming. My friend handed it to her husband who had never seen it before and had him read it to their kids while she video taped the event. He was practically bawling by the time he finished. It's a tremendously heart-warming view of life's journey and it's continuation to the next generation. Adults may appreciate it more than kids, but kids will remember it, especially when they remember that Daddy or Grandma cried when they read them that story.
B000MQC9H4|2.0|Film Review of \\"The Holiday\\" (2006):    By one scene this film was ruined for me.    Within one day of ending a bad relationship, the character Amanda Woods  travels a quarter of the world away from her problem. She's staying in  an isolated house in a land unfamiliar to her. It's night. A vulgar  drunk, a stranger, pounds on her front door. And what does she do? She  opens the door to him. Not Smart. He staggers into the house, then the  bathroom, where he urinates the alcohol out of his system. Based upon  this first impression she decides she has to have him. They share a  drink. He invites himself to stay in the house for the night. She  agrees. They move to a couch and begin kissing. She reasons away her  self-respect by justifying lust with a stranger. Eight and a half  minutes (!) after meeting this man she leads him to the bedroom.    This is what they offer women as an example to follow in romance? This  is supposed to be our dream? And at Christmas no less. This scene is  human degradation wrapped in a pretty package. With all films it is  necessary for the viewer to suspend disbelief. But to suspend your  morals, discernment, or basic common sense? No. That is too much to  ask. I won't give over my understanding of the difference between what  is right and what is wrong to lend dignity to an objectionable idea  that's been manipulated to appear beautiful.    With this scene set early as the foundation of the \\"love\\" story I  couldn't enjoy the remainder of the film. The film was too tainted for  any later tenderness to redeem it in my eyes.
B00005JPTK|3.0|An entertaining movie, kept us at the edge of our seats until the end.  The ending is a little disappointing.  The alternate ending on the 2nd disc is interesting but I see someone was trying to make a HUGE statement with it.  Fun movie but that's about it.
156224003X|5.0|Effortless Mastery is a wonderful book. So many great insights that really cut to the core of why we all play and love music. Werner's thoughts on practicing have profoundly helped me.     The basic idea, when it comes to practicing is to get control of your focus and be patient. We all feel like we have a ton of things to work on and frequently our mind rushes us through ten things without absorbing anything at all. Werner's approach is to work for short bursts on something basic to your playing, like a rhythm or a technique or the form of a tune, all the while remaining detached and not even trying to play correctly. In fact, your mind should go the other way while practicing, \\"I hope I play it wrong.\\"     Every mistake that you make shows you where the problems in your playing lie. You then keep reducing the material until you can effortlessly play something or in other words until it is mastered. And this micro practicing has a macro effect as confirmed by my own experiences and also elaborated on in the book.
B00133KFGW|5.0|We watched this movie upon recommendation of a friend. We went into the movie without knowing anything about the plot. What can I say...we LOVED it. It may be a little unrealistic but the movie taught us to view everyday's things in a different way. To find music in everything, everywhere. I couldn't pull myself away until the movie ended. Great movie for families to watch together. I highly recommend this movie.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|For some reason I had some resistance to watching this new series from HBO.  Was it going to be so-so like \\"Tell Me You Love Me\\"?  Was it another \\"John From Cincinnati\\" that only 10% of it's viewing audience understood (or cared about)?    Where was the next \\"Soprano's\\", \\"Six Feet Under\\", \\"Sex in the City\\"? Why was I even getting HBO - I've seen their movies over and over and anything new was not anything I wanted to see so as a last ditch effort to convince myself that I \\"needed\\" HBO, one cold and rainy Saturday, I decided to give \\"In Treatment\\" a chance (I have onDemand and had access to 7 of the 9 weeks of \\"sessions\\" thus far).    The deal was I only had to watch one or two of the 30 minutes episodes.  If I didn't like it, at least I could say that I gave it a chance.  Okay, you already know the obvious based on my title of this review how much I liked it, but I need to state it again, GET TREATED!  It's that great.  Beyond great as a matter of fact.      We get to follow the week-to-week therapy sessions of 4 individuals (including the therapist) and one couple.  If you've ever been to therapy, it's an instant recognition of the process.  If you want to spend time with an incredible drama with the sharpest, most relatable writing and actors that can't convince me they aren't actors but real players for the entertainment of us \\"flies on the wall\\", then this might be a series for you.  Gabriel Byrne, who portrays the therapist is phenomenal.    Does it sound normal that a person should get depressed and want to go into therapy to discuss why this season ending should affect me so?  Call me crazy and make me an appointment!

0679720200|4.0|Traditionally this is considered a book about alienation. To me it tells the tragedy of having feelings considered alien by the society in which you live.<br /><br />After killing a man, Meursault is taken before people who shamelessly express their desire to judge him by his personality rather than by what he did or didn't. Even the fact that he was not seen to cry at his mother's funeral becomes an evidence of his guilt. At the same time when all society turns against him in repulsion for his diversity, we start to see the honesty and naivety inherent in his thoughts and decisions. His realization at the end is genial.
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|One real gem is Please Crawl Out Your Window. A throw-away when Bob did it, but all of Bruce in this version.    As for Dylan covers - He was ALWAYS covered from the start (Byrds, Peter Paul & Mary, Turtles) so what's the big deal.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|Bruce Springsteen's new release, Magic, proves that the man has still got it. While this doesn't touch his awesome work from the `70s through early 80's and there is no classic like \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"Hungry Heart\\" here, most of the songs are very good. The opening rocker \\"Radio Nowhere\\" may be Bruce's hardest rocking song ever. Tracks like \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\", \\"Livin' In The Future\\", and \\"I'll Work for Your Love\\" all boast great hooks and strong choruses and in another time when real music was played on the radio, would all have been hit singles. While some of the lyrics on the album are political, most notably on the anti-war track, \\"Last to Die\\", Bruce never comes off sounding preachy. Other great tracks include the driving \\"Gypsy Biker\\", the melancholy tribute \\"Terry's Song\\", the melodic \\"Long Walk Home\\" and the somber title song. The only missteps on the album are his attempts to replicate the mid-60's schmaltzy ballads on \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" and \\"Girls in the Summer Clothes.\\" I also agree with some reviewers that this album's production is too compressed and the more you listen to it, the more it grates on you, thus the 3.5 star rating. However, Magic is Bruce's best album in quite awhile and is definitely worth the purchase.
B000059ZIC|5.0|Another reviewer has made the \\"Czech Connection\\". It is fun to suppose that the Brahms/Dvorak relationship and the wealth of Bohemian musicality which they both appreciated has been genetically preserved in Joseph Suk. Fanciful speculation of course, but there is no doubt that Suk plays these three Sonatas with a greater sense of phrasing and much broader tone colour than the others with whom I'm familiar and who do not share this musical heritage.     The three Sonatas were recorded in the now-gone Kingsway Hall two years before the premature death of Julius Katchen who essentially was a solo recitalist - I think his recordings of the complete Brahms solo piano repertoire quite the best - but, as these sonatas demonstrate, also was a very fine and empathetic accompanist.     Of the recordings of these delightful Sonatas currently available, I think this one is a classic and the yardstick against which others should be measured - it is thoroughly deserving of its inclusion in Decca's \\"Legendary Performances\\" series. The musical synergy of the duo is very evident; the recording quality is excellent and the balance between instruments very much better than usually is achieved with violin/piano pairing.    I have other recordings of these works but they do not have the charm and musicality of this collection which I recommend.

1416550518|4.0|It's 1999 and Grace Bradley receives a note from a movie producer. A film is being made about a suicide that occurred in 1924 at an estate in England called Riverton where Grace worked as a servant. Grace is suddenly confronted with the memories of what happened that night and the secret that she has been holding for 75 years. Grace was only 14 years old when she started working at Riverton just before the First World War started. Over the course of the book, we learn about her life and the lives of the Hartford family, especially the two young girls Hannah and Emmeline, over the next 10 years culminating in that night in 1924.<br /><br />Kate Morton has written a very entertaining novel. She cleverly intertwines the story of 98 year old Grace Bradley remembering the past and 14 year old Grace Bradley experiencing it. Morton creates characters that are interesting but at the same time their mistakes are frustrating but make them seem more human. Morton's characters live life as a series of mistakes connected by failures to learn from them. Morton creates wonderful imagery with her writing and it is easy to see that her degree in English Literature was not wasted.<br /><br />The story is enjoyable but not perfect. Many questions are raised and ignored. Why did Robbie wait so long to contact Hannah? What happened at Riverton while Hannah and Grace were away that led to Mr. Hartford's death? Why did Grace keep her secrets from Hannah? At the same time, Morton does a wonderful job with foreshadowing to pull the reader further into the story to find out why this happened or what did this clue mean? Overall, this is a wonderful book that I am glad to recommend.
B001668J8M|3.0|Heads up! The Amazon description says that the digital copy is \\"for PCs and ipods.\\" In a word... no. The packaging says no iPods. In fact, it also says no Mac, no Zune, no anything but Windows Media Player 10.     In fairness, I suppose that since it's on the box it's my fault for buying it. I just didn't realize I needed to get out a magnifying glass at the store and read the fine print.

1591841666|3.0|Godin is known for pithy, thought-provoking \\"riffs\\" on the New World Economy. \\"The Dip\\" is another in that same vein.    In this slim volume, Godin takes on the issue of quitting -- how many companies quit the right things too quickly and stay with the wrong things too long. The way to superiority and best-in-market ruling is to power through what he calls \\"the dip -- \\" the long period of suffering and pain that comes before true success.    I think Godin has something with the concept of sticking with the wrong things too long, and I agree whole-heartedly with his thought that to pursue excellence, we have to drop the items on our \\"to-do\\" list that aren't contributing to that quest.     I also agree that to make it to \\"greatness,\\" sometimes all you have to do is outlast the other guys.     The only comment I have is that I thought Godin could have provided more real-life examples to really make the book applicable. In theory all his ideas are great ones, but to bring it home I would have liked to see a variety of case examples. Though that would have made the book longer.
1591841992|5.0|Simplicity. This is Dan Roam's message in The Back Of The Napkin. Just as René Descartes summarized the entire philosophy of existence in five words (just three in the Latin translation) and Stephen Hawking summarized the history of time in a book with a single mathematical formula, Roam gives business communicators a lesson in simplicity.    We all dread business meetings with their mountains of documents that few people ever read, and the endless bulleted power points that serve only to dull the mind into nervous slumber. Roam cuts through all that to demonstrate how the use of simple, but well chosen, drawings, executed while the audience watches, can communicate infinitely better that the complex presentations that incite loathing and yield only distraction.   Is a picture truly worth a thousand words? Having told us how to communicate with pictures, Roam rounds out his message by explaining that \\"We don't show an insight-inspiring picture because it saves a thousand words; we show it because it elicits the thousand words that make the greatest difference.\\" And that is communication that works.

B000Z6MIQS|2.0|I was shocked when I listened to the album.  It does not have that \\"Simple Plan\\" sound that you heard on their first two albums.  If someone had put the album on without telling me who it was, I wouldn't have guessed it was them.  Some of the tracks sound like they have a little bit of hip hop mixed in.  It wasn't necessarily a bad album.  I'm open to other sounds.  But I was disappointed that it didn't have that \\"Simple Plan\\" sound.  Hopefully their next album will be more like \\"No Pads...\\" was.
1416550518|5.0|While this story is intriguing and has a nice depth to it, there are other things I appreciated about it, too. I really liked the language the author uses to describe the characters' feelings, and their dialogue: It flows easily and makes it easy to read and feels so natural - not forced or stilted. The move between past and present is smooth and easy to navigate: I found myself as interested in Grace \\"now\\" as Grace \\"then.\\"<br /><br />I really enjoy how many different things are happening on different levels. There is the separation of status levels: the staff, who knows \\"its place\\" and wouldn't dream of crossing that line between it and its masters, and the rich upper class owners of Riverton, and their families. It's interesting how people from both status levels are easy to like, and sometimes dislike - they are all human and all have their own problems and victories and they interact believably and their personalities evoke feelings in the reader. My favorite \\"rich\\" girl is Hannah - her sharp intelligence (you'll love the play she and her siblings put on and how she illustrates her point of view to her father) and ambition coupled with compassion and her willingness to include Grace in conversation is appealing. My favorite \\"servant\\" is Alfred ... I feel deeply for his dilemma - he is given a white feather to call attention to his \\"cowardice\\" for not joining the military and fighting in the war ... he is most definitely not a coward, but in proving that, he seems to destroy himself in other ways.<br /><br />There is the almost-friendship between Grace and Frederick's children (Grace is fascinated by \\"The Game\\" and by the girls' dreams, I think), the relationship and history of Grace and her mother (and the mystery of why Grace's mother quit working at Riverton yet wanted Grace to work there), deaths, births, the war that is going on and how it is affecting - or not affecting - Riverton, plus all that is going on in Grace's \\"now,\\" as a 98-year-old woman who is trying to help a movie being made about Riverton be more accurate.<br /><br />I was amazed at how quickly and easily the pages of this book disappeared ... I could probably rave about it for pages, but to keep it shorter and sweeter: This book is a treasure; don't miss it!movie being made about Riverton be more accurate.

I get that they tapped into new resources and turned to new influences, but this sounds NOTHING like the one before. Where are their quick witty lyrics that we all know by heart and love?

B00004YTZE|5.0|Johnn Thunders & The Heartbreakers-L.A.M.F. *****<br /><br />L.A.M.F. is hardly a punk album, and on that note Johnny Thunders & The Heartbreakers was hardly a punk band, though I can see where the comparison would be made. They played loud, fast, explosive rock n' roll, the vocals were harsh yet perfect, and the three original members were addicted to heavy drugs. But when you come down to it, much like Nolan, and Thunders' other band New York Dolls, is often spoke of as a punk band, they are really just two great raw rock n' roll bands.<br /><br />The New York Dolls have always been since the first time I heard them one of my all time favorite bands, but I must say that L.A.M.F. far surpasses any of the Dolls albums as classic as they may be. Had The Heartbreakers gone on to make more albums I am sure they would be considered one of the single greatest bands of all time. Songs like the classic and prophetic 'Born To Lose' 'All By Myself' and 'Get Off The Phone' are classic Thunders compositions with rocking guitar riffs from him and Walter Lure. 'Pirate Love' 'One Track Mind' 'Goin Steady' and 'Cant Keep My Eyes On You' also fit under this claim and would go on to be Thunders standards in concert. Billy Rath was a great bass player, but it was Jerry Nolan that was really the drive behind the bands sound. During his day he was one of the finest rock drummers around.<br /><br />But perhaps the center piece of the album is 'Chinese Rocks.' Which was written by Dee Dee Ramone when he was trying to start a band with Richard Hell, then Hell kept the song and joined the Heartbreakers and the band began to play in then Hell quit and Thunders kept it and recorded it. Ramone was pissed to say the least and recorded his own version with The Ramones years later but to far less acclaim then Thunders' version. This is the classic version, and easily one of the best songs in the history of rock, also one of the truest songs ever, especially since Johnny sang it.<br /><br />L.A.M.F. was released to minimal success and so the band disbanded, which is sad because of how great they could have been. Many live bootlegs of the band were released over the years, which are all worth checking out. Thunders would have a decent solo career and would remain an icon. Over the years this album has received many reissues and sound improvements with this being the best one. This version also comes with a video of the band performing 'Chinese Rocks.' This is one album not to miss out on.ccess and so the band disbanded, which is sad because of how great they could have been.

B0015KO52S|5.0|First of all, forget whatever you thought you knew about The Raconteurs. This album would be hard-pressed to be much more different from \\"Broken Boy Soldiers,\\" their 2006 debut. From Jack's first searing guitar notes of the title track, which opens the album, through the quirky Dylan-esque \\"Carolina Drama\\" that closes it, this album shows that the Racs did not just drive up to the stop light and then continue on after the light changed. They hung a right and buried the gas.<br /><br />What's different from \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\"? The energy level is higher, for one thing. While there is a mix of different paced songs on the album, overall they've taken the energy to a new level. The first album had a \\"sound\\" that extended throughout the entire album; this does not. It's also not as polished an album as their first (and that's a good thing, not a bad thing - nor is it a criticism of \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\"). While Brendan's pop-meister sensibilities and skills are evident (their cover of Terry Reid's \\"Rich Kid Blues\\" is a good example), they are not as pronounced as on \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\". There are some rough edges to the sound that add to the energy and a dark edginess that lurks in the background (\\"Top Yourself\\" is an excellent example). Some of their influences, such as country, are more obvious (Dirk Powell's fiddling is lovely). And Jack III's love of the blues is much more evident. The use of the Memphis Horns on some tracks raised my eyebrows until I heard them; the use is sparing and fits beautifully (I can't begin to count how many rock songs have been ruined by the addition of horns - Jackie Bollweevil and Brendan Boy knew exactly what they were doing here). And some of Jack's slide work will positively make your skin crawl!<br /><br />It's premature for me to add any detailed commentary on the individual songs (I've only given the album three careful [translate: headphones] listens, although it's been playing constantly since I got it), but \\"Carolina Drama\\" is definitely my fave so far - it's killer good. Side note: \\"Five On The Five\\" has evolved considerably since it was played in concerts on the 2006 tour.<br /><br />What I can say is, even though it's only March, this is easily one of the best albums of 2008, and it's going to be very heavily played at this house for a long time to come. My advice is to buy this album, put it in your car stereo, turn it up all the way, and drive around town with all the windows down (even if it's snowing, and definitely in the rain) - that is what rock `n' roll was intended for, and this is most definitely rock `n' roll of the first order.<br /><br />While this album is very different from \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\", it is absolutely outstanding in every way.

0452289963|1.0|Tolle's philosophy is intellectually primitive and spiritually immature. There is nothing new in what he says and is reminiscent of the 60's culture when Timothy Leary and drug use was so popular. It's the same hippy \\"free love,\\" amoral, surrender your ego rhetoric Charles Manson and other cult leaders have used to brainwash followers.     It lacks logical consistency and demonstrates a superficial understanding of the ego. It is mostly a fantasy that attempts to recapture human infancy experiences and claim that they are reality. Like many gurus of this sort who use such rhetoric about the 'ego,' 'ultimate reality,' 'space,' 'time,' and 'oneness,' the main idea is a regression to an infantile state of mind where there are no inhibitions and thus no morality, as well as no sense of self as a separate individual. For infants there is only 'now'. Consequently, Tolle's books invite readers to de-evolve, or at least arrest their developmental progress, and return to the paradise of infancy. \\"Refuse to grow-up\\" would be a better title for his book.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Like many I was disappointed when the series ended and the Ori were still out there.  This DVD continues the tale in a very true way and wraps up one part of the puzzle.  Really loved it!  Special effects are great and it rings true to the Stargate tradition.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I HAD NEVER SEEN THIS SHOW AND WE BOUGHT IT AFTER WATCHING SERENTY.  I FELL IN LOVE ONLY TO FIND OUT THEY NO LONGER  AIR THE SERIES.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|This dvd was not what I expected.  It was true to the story, but I didn't like the animated look to everything.
B000H5U832|5.0|I have to admit when I first saw this movie and it came out I didn't get it.  I didn't like it either, for some reason it just didn't fit my tastes.  Yeah it was cute and everything, but it didn't grab my attention.  Maybe because I wasn't really interested in it at the time.<br /><br />Once my first child became two years old, she was really into Cars (not per se the movie but the actual cars like Hot Wheels) and well I was looking for something for her to watch on a movie in the dvd player in the van.  I came across Cars the movie once again.  Boy did she love it!  This is the only movie that my daughter can watch about 3-4 times and beg for more of and I have grown to love this movie too.<br /><br />The animation of this movie is outstanding, far surpasses a lot of what pixar has done and makes me feel like driving through Arizona sometime soon just to see it in person.  The storyline is funny and the characters are funning and loving.  The message that the movie sends is very heartwarming in which a car finds who he really is.  The music goes great with the movie and one thing that I really love about the movie is every time you watch it, you see something you didn't before.  Something that Pixar put that you didn't notice until you saw it a little bit closer.<br /><br />For example, Sally hits Luigi when she is talking to Mcqueen, there are tire tracks in the sky when they are racing in the dirt, etc...it's neat to see how they put hidden stuff in there like that.<br /><br />If you saw this movie once and didn't like it, I recommend to watch it again and see for yourself.  I love it now and sit down with my daughter when she watches it.  It's one of Pixars best and I wish they would make another one, but they don't like to do sequels.
B000MCIBE8|1.0|This is NOT the original recording. It has been remixed. Bad idea. I don't understand why the Doors albums were remastered in 1999, but only released in the US in that box set. The '99 remasters sounded great. But now they're remixed?? I think even the average listener would be able to tell that something just doesn't sound right here. It isn't the same classic recordings you're used to hearing.<br /><br />Now, why am I against the remixes? Well, for one, it opens the door to reinterpretation. I mean, why not get a whole host of remixers for the project? You could have today's top DJs remixing classic albums from every era. You could buy the Timbaland version of Light My Fire for when you want that combination of Jim Morrison and super sexy deep club beats. Why not just put the raw tracks on DVD audio and let the listener \\"remix\\" for themselves? Maybe you could get some guest musicians to add tracks to the original recordings. I mean, maybe what LA Woman really needs is a Slash guitar solo. Or how about getting Napalm Death to add some crunchy heaviness to Roadhouse Blues?<br /><br />Do you get the point? If you start rearranging the past, where do you stop? And now these remixed CDs are taking the place of the original catalog, so new listeners will be hearing something totally different than what we originally heard and fell in love with. Classics are classics for a reason. Remastering for higher fidelity is one thing, but remixing, rearranging, and reinterpreting are quite another.
0810993139|5.0|My 7-year-old daughter asked for this book, which has since been hugely enjoyed by my husband, my 10-year-old son, and now myself. Greg is pretty much an average middle-schooler, with a geeky best friend, an older brother who picks on him, and parents who frequently embarrass him. This book is hugely funny, gross enough to appeal to a kid's sense of humor, and wickedly on-target for an adult audience. With its line-drawing cartoons and hand-printed text style, it even looks like the notebook some kid dropped on his way to school (even moreso after it's been read under the covers at night, by flashlight, by all of the kids in my house). But even though it's laugh-out-loud entertainment, the kid in \\"Wimpy Kid\\" still seems like a real person, with a real kid's worries and mess-ups. (What if people find out the nickname his little brother calls him? What if his best friend stays mad at him? How can he get out of the school play?) Everybody in our family loved this book. When I brought the second installment home yesterday, it passed hands like a game of Hot Potato because everybody wanted to be the first to read it.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|The DVD was delivered in a timely manner, and the product itself was as advertised. I really enjoyed American Gangster, despite some changes to the real story of Frank Lucas, it still made for a great movie. The changes I'm referring to is that Frank Lucas is actually from LaGrange, North Carolina which is a small country town in Eastern North Carolina (Wayne County). The movie gives the viewers the impression that his family is from Greensboro,NC. The act about his cousin's head being blown off took place in LaGrange. That doesn't change how good the movie actually is, and I feel confortable buying videos from amazon.com.

B0010X73ZG|5.0|The Mist is the latest Stephen King adaptation based on one of his short stories. It's about a town invaded by a strange mist (the fog anyone?) this time populated by beasts and bugs from hell (or someone just as nasty).<br /><br />The story builds well, the monsters are great and I found this whole thing really entertaining.<br /><br />Marcia Gay Harden made a great Fundy Christian but I for one was glad (spoiler ahead) when she bit the dust, she just wouldn't shut up!<br /><br />Thomas Jane was good as the leading man and all in all a great horror film with groovy monsters and great atmosphere.
B0010X745K|2.0|This was one of the worst endings ever in cinema. Also as a parent I can say it was unrealistic beyond belief. Any normal parent, no matter what the circumstances, would never do what that guy did. NEVER! I'd have sat and played tick tac toe with my son and died of dehydration in that car.<br /><br />open ended is fine. This ending however was one of the worst in cinema history. Downer endings need to be done so that the viewer is still left feeling satisfied. Usually protagonist characters are sacrificed in a way that lets the viewer feel it was justified under the circumstances. Even in \\"The Thing\\", which I can tell from the lame use of the poster in the beginning, that this film hopes to align itself with, the two characters are still alive when the film ends. Speculation can occur with us the viewers as to what happened after the credits roll. SPOILER ALTERT!!! STOP READING!!!!! Killing your own son is nonsense. I am a father with a boy right about the age of the boy in the film. I would have sat in that car till I dehydrated with my son. There is no way any normal parent, which they made this guy out to be, would ever do that. Also it was in contradiction to what they had showed us all along. No matter how wild a film it has to at least adhere to the rules it sets up for us as we watch it. The film showed us a caring father,and no caring parent would ever do what this guy did. I don't care what horrible death from some beast from another dimension might be awaiting us. A parents job on this planet is not to take the life of their children. Anyone who enjoyed this ending must not be a parent yet. And if you are a parent and you did like this ending, God help you.<br /><br />Also: I can not believe this film was made by the same guy who did Shawshank and Green Mile. Those films have the most satisfying endings ever and this film has one of the least satisfying ending ever. I'm actually dumfounded.  It's like he went nuts and wants to ruin his career. Scratch him from directors who's careers I will follow carefully.ho's careers I will follow carefully.
B000UD0ESA|3.0|After the fanfare surrounding the 2007 Director's Cut release of Blade Runner, I said to myself, \\"How could I have never seen this film?\\" So I put it in my Netflix queue on Blu Ray at the end of last year and was informed of \\"a very long wait.\\" So I added it to my Amazon wish list after seeing some of my Friends here praise the movie as classic.<br /><br />But I never ultimately purchased the movie. There was just something...something not compelling. I changed my Netflix request from the Blu Ray version to the standard DVD version and still got the long wait message. So I left it that way and forgot about it. Lo and behold, Blade Runner arrived after almost a 90 day wait from the time I requested it.<br /><br />Why that long-winded story above? Because it should speak volumes about how great this film is, right? Well, not really. What Blade Runner is...is a 'cult' classic. Which means there are a ton of fanatics that will want to crucify me for this review that suggests Blade Runner is a good movie...not a classic movie.<br /><br />Sure I saw the 'visionary' aspect of the film. I saw the effects that were way ahead of their time. I saw the great package that was offered for this release...one that included 5-disks worth of material! But, color me shallow, I'm in it for the movie and its quality. Even the movies that I collect as classics 'in my book' are in my collection not because of hours of extras (in fact I rarely watch extras...maybe a making-of here or there *if* it promises to be short). I usually only *buy* a movie for my collection that blew me away. Getting blown away by a movie is the definition of a classic to me; a movie that had great 'vision' for its time to me is a movie that had great vision for its time...not a classic.<br /><br />Blade Runner was a good movie. One that had an interesting visionary approach. The story was very cool. \\"Replicant\\", genetically engineered humans are man-made to perform menial tasks on \\"off-worlds\\" that ultimately revolt in an I, Robot kind of way. But Blade Runner had an odd pace, the action was reined in over dark, futuristic images, and the film seemed just discombobulated at times.<br /><br />So I'll stop whining like a 4 year old now, and wrap this up by saying--again--Blade Runner was a *good* movie. But, man, you'd have to be a real die-hard to buy some 5-disk edition and watch not one, but three versions of this movie with hours and hours of extras.<br /><br />Okay fans, you have three words for me, right?...\\"Time to die\\".olt in an I, Robot kind of way.

B00006I53S|5.0|As I mention in the title of the review, this is the opinion of a serious amateur.  If you are a pro (or have such aspirations) or have a large equipment budget, you'll likely be looking for something else.  For those of us who have to make our hobby money stretch a long way, here's my review:    I purchased this lens in September of 2007 for use on holiday in Italy.  I've used the lens extensively since, but its performance on the trip was   an incredible trial by fire.  As it was a two week trip and luggage space and weight were at a premium, I wanted to only bring one or two lenses that would cover most of the situations I thought I would encounter.  I chose the EF 28-135 for two reasons:  its range of focal length and the image stability feature.    With the typical 1.6x crop factor, I found my outdoor shots of landscapes and architecture rather tight, even at the 28mm focal length.  This is of course not the lens's fault, but rather my choice and my camera's limitations.  Otherwise, the lens was spectacular.  It is crisp, focuses quickly, and yields consistent, predictable shots.    At this point, I have to comment on the IS.  Many ruins and almost all churches and museums prohibit both flash photography and the use of tripods.  In the face of these hindrances, the IS was simply a life-saver.  One of several such examples involved over 500 year old tapestries in the Vatican.  They were presented in a darkened room with only muted, indirect illumination.  With the IS (and a steady hand) I was able to shoot them at 1/4s shutter with results, considering the subject, which were nothing short of amazing.  If you're jittery and off balanced, it's not going to do much for you.  But if you need to stretch a few vital stops while using good technique, it is amazing.    Pros:  -Great value  -IS isn't a gimmick.  It works well if used correctly.  -Excellent image quality for the price-point  -Nice range of focal lengths in a single lens    Cons:  -Barrel extends considerably at the telephoto end with noticeable slop.  -For a consumer lens, this thing is huge and heavy.  When you're carrying it with the hood (not included) equipped, people are going to stare.  -Not quick, whatsoever.  It's listed as f/3.5-5.6, but you'll be shooting at the higher end of that at most focal lengths.    Summary:    A great walk-around and travel lens for many circumstances.  In my opinion, the best Canon lens for the novice photographer in terms of both price and flexibility.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie speaks to the soul and sings in the heart.  The lovingly remembered songs of the Beatles are given to interesting characters to live through.  As they do, you live through their lives too. Open you mind and you will enjoy this movie through the progression of song.
B000X5KSWM|1.0|If it isn't Metal, it isn't music!  At least, that's how I feel about things.  Tarja, if you've read my review of the END OF AN ERA DVD, you know I once met you and personally thanked you for the touch of class you've brought to my music, HEAVY METAL!  Metal is so full of power, passion, creativity, and drive.  Yet your ballads with NIGHTWISH provided a positive and very beautiful contrast to the might and the power of hard rocking songs like SLAYING THE DREAMER and Metal epics like GHOST LOVE SCORE.  Now you choose to create a boring album full of lack luster songs lacking in the passion, great musicianship, and the astounding compositions that Nightwish was famous for.    I said in my review of END OF AN ERA that the fans would be the ultimate losers.  Sadly I was right on target eventhough I wanted desperatly to be wrong.  Tarja, why do you strive to be so ordinary when you are the epitome of extraordinary?  You have so much more to give the world!!  Wake up and realize that in Heavy Metal, and ONLY in Heavy Metal, will the world truly be able to hear the full range of your voice and experience your incredible talents.  Come back to us, Tarja.  Tuomas has said, \\"we'll be waiting.\\"  So will I, my dear, for I love your voice and your music with the group.  Your charisma with the band was astonishing!  But MY WINTER STORM is like a slap in the face to me and ALL Metal fans.   I think we all deserve much better than this boring new album.  Don't you?

B000UO8BB6|4.0|While not quite a classic, Herbie's debut is still solid post-bop, even though there were better albums on the way. The bluesy, laid-back \\"Watermelon Man\\" has since become a jazz standard, and it's an unforgettable composition, though I think the Headhunters version is a little bit better myself. Most the rest of the album is in the same vein, but it's a good vein to be in, and besides, Herbie gets some solid compositions riding that groove - \\"Three Bags Full\\", \\"Empty Pockets\\", and \\"Driftin'\\" aren't groundbreaking, but they're plenty solid. \\"The Maze\\" is the record's other huge high point, an unforgettably eccentric melody, great post-bop groove, and a top-notch trumpet solo. The lone ballad, \\"Alone and I\\", is beautifully desolate. And Herbie knows exactly what he's doing here, never overstepping his bounds and taking things into experimental territory. It's good because it makes the record a ton more competent, but it also works against the record in a way, because my favorite Hancock album (Empyrean Isles) is incredibly experimental itself. Still, you can't blame a guy for playing it straight on his first record, and besides, Herbie does a good job of it. Later Hancock albums may overshadow it, but you shouldn't overlook Takin' Off just because of that.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Watched it years ago yet still find it enjoyable today. Yes the shower scene was good (ha) but what grabbed me was the robot's personality. Close to human as ever.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|Before I begin, I'd like to warn people that I make some fairly harsh accusations of Prince in this review. But I'm still a big fan of his, and I enjoy most of this album, despite the problems I have with the lyrics. I also do a bit of soapboxing, but that's because I have a deep-seated hatred of prejudice, and the aforementioned lyrics have their share of that. So, here I go... I wonder what would happen if Prince found this review...<br />A concept album about Jehovah's Witnesses. I'm sure you're waiting with bated breath for me to yell out, \\"Ha! You fell for it! Sucker!\\", but that's the honest truth. Prince is a Jehovah's Witness himself now, by the way. What a freakish coinkydink! And while I can't see anyone who's not a Jehovah's Witness relating to the lyrics on this album, I really like the music. Basically, it's Prince reclaiming his roots in funk, jazz, and R&B, which turns out to be a great combination. My advice is that, unless you are a Jehovah's Witness, you tune out to the lyrics entirely and focus on the music. Thankfully there are a lot of instrumental breaks on the title track - most of its length is given to extreme jamming, and let me tell you, those are some impressive solos. And the funk is far from stale - Prince put a lot of effort into making \\"The Work, pt. 1\\", \\"Digital Garden\\" (with a weird Eastern-tinged synthesizer part), \\"1+1+1 is 3\\", and \\"The Everlasting Now\\" as funky, danceable, and musically challenging as he possibly could. He also pulls out all the stops on the ballads, such as the jazz-tinged \\"Muse 2 the Pharaoh\\" and the melodic-to-the-max \\"Everywhere\\" and \\"Mellow\\". Even segues such as the quirky \\"Wedding Feast\\" are considerably more imaginative than the ones on Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic, O)+>, or the Gold Experience. I'll grant that \\"She Loves Me 4 Me\\" is trite and treacly, but that's just one song out of fourteen. Now, the lyrics... not a fan of those. Sometimes they border on racist - on \\"Family Name\\", you'll note how Prince implies that every race but the white people can be considered \\"rainbow children\\" deserving of the highest blessing, or whatever. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for racial equality, but I'm also white, so this offends me. I mean, yeah, white people have caused a lot of problems in this world, but there have been some good ones - Abraham Lincoln, Bill Gates (one of the greatest philanthropists in history, you know) and Winston Churchill certainly come to mind, and easily belong with heroes and heroines like Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Nelson Mandela (not to mention Ghandi, Buddha, and yes, Jesus - I'm not very religious, but I won't deny the guy had an amazing message that I try my best to live by). I'm not trying to make excuses for the horrible things white people have done - and they have done horrible things - but you can't write all of them off as evil just because some of them are. The irony is that I'm totally down with the song's restless jazz-funk groove, and the guitar trickery Prince pulls out at the end is amazing as it always is. The most disgraceful part of the lyrics, though, is when, during the title track, he trivializes the Holocaust. May I go throw up now? Eleven million people died in the Holocaust, Prince. You wanna know why? Because that sick-minded freak who, far and away, is the nadir of humanity (I honestly don't think his name isn't even worthy of mention - I seriously treat it like a grave obscenity) was under the totally false impression that his twisted little beliefs were the only correct ones, and all of those who believed in anything else were to be put to death. I wonder if he put any thought at all into that lyric, or if he just spat it out to cause a bit of controversy. Let's take every lyric of that song out, because it's also an appallingly sexist creation, and let's focus on the instrumental soloing instead, because I love the soloing. I just hate the lyrics, that's all. Thankfully, lyrics are easy for me to block out. I won't completely overlook them - this would've gotten a much higher score if Prince had eschewed them entirely, in fact - but Prince has talent to burn, and he puts all of it into the music of this album. And there is one track that has solid music and lyrics: the moving ballad \\"Last December\\", with a shockingly forceful end that is even more extreme than the coda to \\"Purple Rain\\", and a guitar solo that rivals that classic. It helps that the lyrics are about uniting, rather than dividing. That's a good thing for people like me, who believe in equality for all people. So, here's what you've gotta do with this one. Forget the hideous lyrics ever existed, block out all of the racist and sexist undertones, and focus on the music. Because the arranging and performing on this one are fantastic. The lyrics, however, are not. I think Prince went a bit too far into making this the \\"controversial new album\\", as the sticker on the cover proclaims it. That's annoying, and it's also annoying that Prince goes out of his way to shock people just for the sake of being shocking, because as I've said before, he's got a lot of talent and I think it's a big waste of it. I have no objections to him getting his sex-god on, even though I don't think he's got any mojo (seriously, he weighs ten pounds and he's, like, two feet tall), but I've got a lot of objections to this, and Prince is one of my favorite artists. I honestly don't think Jesus is a fan of racism, sexism, homophobia, or religious intolerance. But hey, the music is through the roof. And I'm repeating myself.

B000WS4QJG|4.0|I agree with the product description, the music holds up. The previously unreleased tracks are awesome. Well worth it.
B000002LHX|3.0|Often written off as a halfhearted piece of crap, but I kinda like it. It sure isn't Purple Rain, and it's true that some of it's either mediocre (\\"Electric Chair\\"; \\"Vicki Waiting\\") or bad (the treacly Sheena Easton duet \\"In the Arms of Orion\\"), and the #1 hit \\"Batdance\\", an incoherent collection of samples, doesn't do a thing for me. But the best material here, while not among Prince's finer material, is solid entertainment just the same. I'm definitely a fan of \\"Partyman\\", one of his funkiest songs ever; the ballad \\"Scandalous\\" is damn pretty, if nothing else; \\"The Future\\" and \\"Trust\\" are pretty far from \\"When Doves Cry\\" or \\"Kiss\\", but still have pretty good grooves. I mean, sure, they're the kind of songs Prince could've pumped out in his sleep, but they're still enjoyable, because Prince is the kind of guy who could put out good material in his sleep. He's got plenty of talent, see. I mean, he even makes a generic drum machine rhythm sound good on \\"Lemon Crush\\". Not many people can do that. I sure couldn't. So yeah, this is kind of Prince's blow-off album. But he's got such prodigal musical that even his blow-off albums are at least likeable, though not exactly brilliant. It's not the kind of album that will stick with you after you've heard it, but while it's playing, it's nice. The movie's good, too. Jack Nicholson steals the show. Hell, the movie's pretty much ALL Jack Nicholson, but whatever.
B000YPUF9W|3.0|I am torn between liking this series of movies and rejecting them for many a few reasons. Mainly its the fact that niether movie follow the game. Resident Evil Apocolypse was close only because it was in Raccoon City and it featured Jill Valentine. But overall there isnt much there. Only a few key elements of these movies tie in with the game..Umbrella Corp and the un-dead. Thats it.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|Great gun fights! Great humor! The all-star cast makes for an interesting mix, and the Kasdan brothers did a good job of taking every aspect of the typical Western without going over the top.
1563894696|2.0|This book's stature among Battales is perplexing. The story has many flaws. It's a sparse script. There's nothing to it. Many pages have so few words that your focus and time is spent turning pages than reading them. The rogue cameos are pointless and add little, especially Catwoman, who is seen throughout the story for no apparent reason, which we don't find out until the end of Dark Victory. Plus Batman doesn't play a big role in the discovery of the killer, whose identity at the end is still in doubt. This is easily Jeph Loeb's weakest Batman tale. Dark Victory and especially Catwoman When in Rome are superior, and Hush has the unfair advantage of Jim Lee's great artwork. A novel, like other works of art, needs a rhythm and flow, and that is entirely missing when a story reads as fast as this. It's lack of substance leaves the reader with a feeling of squandered opportunity and wasted time. Loeb is a talented writer but he needs to show that by adding depth and essence and not by producing a book that reads like a series of flash cards.

B00132D808|2.0|I am not sure what the story is here but this new panic album is a joke! It lacks all of the elements that made their debut so impressive. I am actually embarrased to listen to this in my car with the windows rolled down. This album lacks edge and is quite boring to listen to, I am sick of bands trying to make throwback \\"beatleesque\\" albums. I truly hope they get poor feedback from this album and they go back to making some music that their fans can be proud of...
1863513418|4.0|If you enjoy a more classical feel to your embroidery and you have been looking to add another dimension to your needlework, The Complete Book of Stumpwork Embroidery will literally do just that. Stumpwork is a traditional, three-dimensional embroidery that has its origins in the 1500s, which was of course the Renaissance, and in keeping with those times it is rich and detailed with all sorts of  natural and botanical themes. Author Jane Nicholas keeps to a somewhat modernized version of this style and warm, earth toned color palette in the designs that she features in the Complete Book of Stumpwork Embroidery.<br /><br /> I have enormous respect for all the time and research that went into the project pictured at the beginning of this book. Ms. Nicholas decided that the best way  to learn stumpwork was to make a sampler, so she started on a design that would take her 5 years to complete as she learned -- and the result is the lavish, detailed masterpiece that decorates the endpapers. It is a wonderful study in Stuart-style raised embroidery, both in theme, composition and technique.  It is the perfect hint of what is to come further into CBOSE.<br /><br />The author is systematic in explaining the tools and basic methods for beginners in the Introduction. Chapter One lists general materials and equipment (which, by the way, are common and easy to obtain in the USA). DMC floss is called for in most projects, and somebody who has the needles and hoops etc. for needle working would probably have all the equipment beforehand. Chapter Two gives general instructions.  From there one simply looks up individual elements for embroidering, which are listed alphabetically (Starting at Acorn and ending with Tulip, then other chapters on Field Flowers and Wildlife). In theory, you could re-create the sampler if you pay careful attention and follow the instructions; or, you could combine the elements into your own designs and projects.<br /><br />Then there comes the second half, which was originally another book published separately . This half is a series of smaller projects: roundels, brooches, a mirror frame, a chatelaine, a pendant.  . The photos of the projects are clear but mostly clumped toward the center. You look up the instructions for each element from the first half of the book, then follow her diagrams and Order of Work. I think of this half as the more beginner-friendly half, as it is easy to find something small (unintimidating) to get started with. On the other hand, it is an awkward system because of the constant flipping through the pages for each part of the design.  Then, if you need a refresher or more instruction on some of the embroidery stitches, you look them up at the back of the book.  So you can see how it would be much less frustrating for somebody with basic embroidering experience to come to stumpwork through this book than it would be for an absolute novice.<br /><br />Yes, this is a complete book on stumpwork embroidery as the title promises., at least as complete as possible in one book. I recommend having some general embroidery experience before you use this book to learn stump work, but you don't have to be proficient to get started. Happy stitching!<br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle
B00011RPB0|5.0|Are you someone who likes curling up with a book on a rainy day, listening to the sound of the rain in your quiet apartment, completely immersed in the text?    You will love Lost in Translation.    Like others have said, this is not the kind of movie you watch with your friends for a laugh. It's something you have to let yourself get lost in, and let yourself believe. There isnt a car chase or a sex scene, and this movie isnt going to fight to keep you interested (like some other movies in theaters which appeal to an ADHD generation).    But get some alone time, go to a quiet space, and forget everything and everyone as you slowly sink into this beautifully crafted film.     Interestingly enough, though this movie is in English, it reminded me of two foreign flicks- Amelie and Pan's Labyrinth.

1932907009|5.0|I found this book tremendously helpful in simplifying the labyrinth that is scriptwriting.  I didn't agree with every single thing Mr. Snyder said, but I really didn't have to.  All I know is that after I finished this entertaining and well-thought-out book, I had moved ahead in my craft. The structure of screenplays was simpler to me than it was before.     I have read other screenwriting books before and while the ideas generally made sense, somehow their application was lost in the telling.  What I liked about Mr. Snyder's book is that it gives concrete examples and instructions on how to make the structure of your screenplay stronger and more marketable.    I also found his second book, Save the Cat Goes to the Movies, tremendously helpful.
B00009EIQE|4.0|First up I'll make it know that I'm a very big fan of Buddy Guy's music and can think of nothing better than sitting down and listening to Buddy do his thing. Now given Buddy's reputation for doing 'his thing' this recording is something of a suprise, possibly a shock for some. This is pretty much an all acoustic affair with minimal backing by other musicians and for the most part it works very well. Buddy undoubtly has his trade mark guitar sound and equally memorable vocal approach, this CD places Buddy in a situation where he only has the bare essentials to work his magic. His guitar work is understated and completely spot on for the mood of this collection of blues covers. His vocal work however, is what this CD is all about and why you should have it in your collection. No crazy unbridled blues vocals here folks, this time around Buddy has very successfuly tapped into a facet of his abilities we have not heard for sometime, keep in mind this CD came out in 2003. Standout tracks for me were Moanin' and Groanin' and Can't See Baby but the more you play this CD the more your preferences will move around, just seems to depend on how your feeling at the time. Well worth the money and your listening time, a definte Buddy classic.

0312379293|4.0|Falsely accused of murdering his best friend, mechanic Danny Cartwright stands trial and is convicted. The evidence of three men, best-friends and drinking buddies, formed the critical evidence against him. Even the sworn word of his fiancee and the dead man's sister that one of those three, not Danny, committed the crime is not enough to convince the jury. After all, Danny was a poor mechanic and the three are affluent, successful, and University graduates.<br /><br />Sent to prison for twenty years, Danny shares a cell with an ex-soldier who teaches Danny the social graces--how to speak, how to eat and order in a posh restaurant, as well as encouraging him to pursue his education. Danny begins to model himself on his cellmate, Sir Nick Moncrieff and when Moncrieff dies, an apparent suicide, Danny is able to switch places with him, eventually enjoying release from prison. A free man, at least temporarily, Danny goes about a plan for revenge on the three men responsible for destroying is life, and that of his fiancee, Beth.<br /><br />Author Jeffrey Archer writes convincingly of both the English trial system and of English prison life. Danny's time, spent both improving himself and surviving in the tricky and dangerous world of prison makes for compelling reading. Once out of prison, Danny finds that he's got to reclaim Nick's life before he can go about destroying the lives of those who destroyed his own life. This portion of the story, and indeed much of the book is a clear homage to Andre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo. Perhaps, however, Archer relied too much on the older story. Danny's attempts to ruin the three conspirators have consequences that stretch far beyond the three, consequences Danny ignored. Also, I would have liked to see a bit more cleverness on the part of Spencer Craig, the actual killer and mastermind.<br /><br />Overall, A PRISONER OF BIRTH made for compelling and page-turning reading. Both Danny and especially Beth are sympathetic characters and Danny's decision to refuse a plea bargain because it would make Beth out to be a liar is especially touching. I do wish Archer had dug a bit deeper into Danny's motivations and his growth as a person.n to refuse a plea bargain because it would make Beth out to be a liar is especially touching.

B0000C9ZLD|3.0|Since I really love the first album, I had high expectations for this one. It is a fairly modest album. Most of the songs are fairly forgettable with a few highlights. It has some of the most interesting guitar tones on any of their albums as in: \\"12:51\\", \\"The Way It Is\\", \\"The End Has no End\\", some of the vocal highlights are probably \\"Under Control\\" \\"Reptilia\\" and \\"Automatic Stop.\\" My main complaint is that the songwriting seems very uninspired and drab for the most part. The lyrics are mostly about relationships and partying. There is only so long that can be really interesting. They lack the sophistication of bands like Nirvana whose musical progress seemed inevitably brilliant. While I do love this band, I get the sneaking suspicion that they are still in the beginning phase of finding their real unique voice. To me it often feels like they are stumbling along and accidentally coming across certain moments of inspiration whereas \\"Is This It\\" seemed very cohesive. But hey, that's just the way it is. Unlike Nirvana, they have a future, and by their album \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" it would seem that that future is very good. Pick this one up if you are a big fan, but for someone who wants a real taste of the strokes, \\"Is This It?\\" or even \\"First Impressions\\" is probably a better bet.
B000WTNCYA|4.0|Leading with the title track, Philly-based singer-songwriter Gardot has her Pink-Panther, moondance groove graced with a chance trumpet, adding a sweet touch of jazz to her acoustic ruminations.  So it goes through each track.  Gardot's garden of Janis-Ian confessional folk, Shelby-Lynne naked country, and Billie-Holiday wistful defiance is dotted with sprays of improvised clarinet, violin, or cello.  This classy set is a sophisticated step-up from the raw, piano-based demos occasionally heard on local NPR affiliates and college radio.  It's as if Gardot's history of heartbreaks (which she credits) and her life-altering auto accident gave her a set of newly opened windows to her soul.  This 34-minute teaser of a debut promises a wealth of wishes from this worrisome heart.
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|In my opinion, this is the first album, before the next album, which will be The Strokes finally coming into their own. Although I have written reviews for both the other albums and I gave \\"Is This It\\" five stars, and \\"Room on Fire\\" 3 stars, I do feel good about where this band is headed. Now that I have listened to both the other albums many many more times I realize that this album is SOO much more evolved than the other two. The songwriting is better, the arrangement is way more savvy, and the lyrics are in a totally different place, much more visionary and less adolescent. I am so confident about the next album, I am going to go ahead and give it Five Stars right off the bat. The reason this doesn't get 5 stars is just because it doesn't seem as sure of itself as it could be. There is a lot here...if you look for it. But it doesn't seem nearly as confident or complete as \\"Is This It.\\" To me it still seems like they are feeling their way into a new style. Very enjoyable. And it is rumored that they are starting on the next album at the end of this year. But who knows...also, if you want to supplement your Strokes craving, go and buy Albert Hammond Jr.'s album which is totally stellar as well.
0375424474|5.0|This is a book that gets better and better as you read it.     I thought it was a bit unfocused in the beginning, and  was not altogether clear what aims the author had.  However, after about 50 (short) pages, the book picks up,   and what follows is a masterful exposition of how we came  to be and how the past still lives within us.  Although the  book is quite short, it offers a very readable history and  description of the discoveries that helped us understand   the descent of modern animals (including us).
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|This is truly a great DVD and shows Celine as the CLASS act that she is.  I have a tape of this show when it opened, and I am pleasantly surprised  that Celine is back to singing --what she does best-- and not being pushed and diluted into dancing which has to take energy away from her voice.    The way the last act--My Heart Will Go On -- was staged was awesome. Very powerful and great bass!    I have not much else to say, except that this being a stupendous show, great DVD recording, beautiful and moving..what else does one need?    Thanks Celine!
B00066R4T8|4.0|An amazing tale of courage, fortitude, and a desire to live, despite dire circumstances. The author, Joe Simpson and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, ascend a perilous section of the Peruvian Andes. Near the summit, tragedy strikes when Joe, up over 19,000 feet, falls and hits a slope at the base of a cliff, breaking his right leg, rupturing his right knee, and shattering his right heel. Beneath him is a seemingly endless fall to the bottom. Simon reaches him but knows that the chances for Joe to get off the mountain are virtually non-existent. Yet, they fashion a daring plan to to do just that.<br /><br />For the next few hours, through a snow storm, they work in tandem, and manage a risky, yet effective way of trying to lower Joe down the mountain. About three thousand feet down, Joe who is still roped to Simon, drops off an edge, and finds himself now free hanging in space six feet away from an ice wall, unable to reach it with his axe. The edge is over hung about fifteen feet above him. The dark outline of a crevasse lies about a hundred feet directly below him.<br /><br />Joe couldn't get up, and Simon couldn't get down. In fact, Joe's weight began to pull Simon off the mountain. So, Simon was finally forced to do the only thing he could do under the circumstances. He cut the rope, believing that he was consigning his friend to certain death. Therein lies the tale.<br /><br />What happens next is sure to make one believe in miracles.
B00104W8T6|4.0|i was enchanted by the music while watching Juno. It was original,fresh and really suited the tone of the movie without dominating any of the action. The CD is not available in New Zealand so I was delighted to be able to get it from Amazon. When i played it at home, I realised there were interesting versions of older records from the Dudes and Carpenters. So plenty to enjoy: old and new and it's been on the CD player frequently since.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|Watching movies on DVD without having seeing them in the theater has its setbacks. I Am Legend Iamlegendbigposter was a huge hit in theaters and by not seeing it, avoiding spoilers for so long was difficult. As a fan of film criticism, I enjoy reading movie reviews, even for movies I haven't seen. So, going into watching this, I was already aware of the basic plot and story elements.<br /><br />For those who haven't seen the film or don't know anything about it, I Am Legend is the third film adaptation of a 1954 story of the same name by Richard Matheson. The story is about Robert Neville, the last remaining human in New York following a massive man-made infectious outbreak (the Krippen Virus) that killed billions of people and turned the surviving millions into night wandering zombie-like creatures that eventually killed the few immune. Neville, a former virologist and army Colonel, is immune to the disease and spends everyday trying to find a cure through experimental vaccination tests, and every night hiding in his house which has been fortified like a modern day military base.<br /><br />An empty and dilapidated New York City is hauntingly beautiful. It brings to mind Alan Weisman's The World Without Us, a story about how nature would take the Earth back if humans did not exist. Director Francis Lawrence gives us breathtaking views of a city falling apart, yet still maintaining its beauty. Humorously, the man-made features that remain in tact the most are billboards that serve as \\"Easter Eggs\\" for the dorks in the audience (me included), like a poster for a Batman/ Superman movie coming out in 2010.<br /><br />What I wasn't aware of before seeing the movie was the most enjoyable part, the character development. Echoing, isolationist characteristics and story arcs of Cast Away, Will Smith gives a wonderful performance as Robert Neville. We're given even greater depth into Neville's character through a series of flashbacks throughout the film that detail Neville's current state of mind.<br /><br />Neville creates as much artificial human contact as possible in his isolation through the use of placing mannequins in normal daily interaction situations. The scenes in the video store are some of the most truthful scenes of the movies giving a window into Neville's loneliness.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine how we would act in a similar situation, but as a dog owner I know that I would rely as much on my dog as Neville does on his, Sam. Sam, a German Shepherd, is immune to the airborne strain of the virus, but not the strain transmitted through a bite. I_am_legend_will_smith__1_ Sam is as powerful of a character as Neville and through masterful storytelling and direction, the audience feels as attached to a dog as we do to the human lead. During the hunting scene we are offered our first glimpse of the infected, the terror that grips the audience not only from the fear on Neville's face, but the fear you can feel in his heart of losing his only friend.<br /><br />As a dog owner, the fear of losing your pet that you love is a scary thought. Lawrence does a wonderful job of building suspense around Sam and Neville's equal need of each other and the terror that surrounds the chance of losing one another.<br /><br />While Neville suspects that the infected have finally stopped showing any signs of human characteristics, he meets one infected that confuses him, showing signs of human cognition and planning. After a trap is sprung and Neville is injured, the dramatic tension quickly rises as swiftly as the sun sets. As Neville and Sam try to flee to their car, a few infected dogs wait at the fading edge of a sunbeam for their chance to strike.<br /><br />(SPOILER- Skip until the end of the alert)<br />This scene begins the end of Neville's remaining desire to live. Iamlegendphoto21While fighting the infected dogs for his life, Neville continues to see Sam locked in a vicious fight with another dog, resulting in multiple bites and wounds. In what is by far the most difficult scene to watch and emotionally difficult, Neville tries to make Sam comfortable while seeing if a vaccinated test can stave of the infection. While Sam lays in Neville's arms dying and slowly becoming infected, tears stream down Neville's face. Neville's only choice to kill Sam the moment Sam has become fully infected.<br /><br />This scene is amazingly well done. Smith's performance of saving his own life, while trying to end Sam's is heart breaking. As he end's Sam's life, you can see Neville's last hopes leave his eyes in the tears streaming down his face.<br /><br />(END OF SPOILERS)<br /><br />From this point on, the movie shifts into a more action oriented theme, but does not totally abandon its prior success. I Am Legend can easily be seen as two films, the first a movie of isolation and how a lone human struggles to maintain his sanity, the second a more typical Hollywood action-thriller.Bfwill<br /><br />We are introduced to two new characters in the second half of the film, both of which are too little too late. Their symbolism is important, but their use in the movie could have been improved. The performances aren't on the same level as Smith's or even Sam's and it's difficult to feel any emotional attachment to them. Their symbolic presence of hope to Neville is important, as a glimpse of normality and his path to a cure and ultimately is his root to spiritual salvation.<br /><br />Like the new characters the climax doesn't stir the same tense feeling initially felt in the first half. As a whole, the movie is very enjoyable, but loses focus in the end. It would be easier to grade the film by its two thematic segments, the first half getting 5 stars, the second half getting 3 stars. Despite its thematic collapse at the end, I Am Legend offers far more enjoyable moments to outweigh its faults and is a movie worth seeing.ionally difficult, Neville tries to make Sam comfortable while seeing if a vaccinated test can stave of the infection.

B00132D808|4.0|I was a fan of their first CD, but it didn't really distinguish itself from a lot of the other bands out there.  However, with this album, it hit me right in my soft spot.  Any band that is influenced by the Beatles always gets some \\"cred\\" with me, and you can't help but see the parallel in sound.    While still possessing that 60's sounding pop, it has the orchestral layers and musical timing that the Beatles did so well.      The first time I heard this album, I wasn't completely sold because it did seem so different than their first record.....but after the second listen, when I knew what I was in for, THAT is when it really started to grow on me.  Now it's on a constant loop in my car MP3 player.  I hope you all give it at least two listens and see how much these guys have really GROWN since their time they've been away (writing songs for you, as they say in their opening track!)
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Vampire Weekend hit the scene in 2006, emerging from New York. Forming while at Columbia University, band members began their quick rise to notoriety. After signing to indie label XL Recordings, they recorded their self-titled album.<br /><br />In 2007, VW grew through popular mention on blogs. Touring with The Shins at the end of 2007, led them into the new year when Vampire Weekend was released in January 2008. Since then, they've been indie darlings. Garnering attention from the likes of Bob Boilen (NPR's All Songs Considered) and most recently playing on Saturday Night Live.<br /><br />Of course as they garnered a quick and large following, they received their share of indie-backlash; a typical cultural reaction to any popular band.<br />Vampire<br />VW wears their influences on their sleeves, whether they intend to or not. \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" brings memories of Paul Simon's Graceland from the opening drum beats, but that's not a bad thing. It also happens to be one of their most lyrically catchy and goofy songs on the album with lyrics like \\"Is your bed made?/ Is your sweater on?\\" or \\"Feels so unnatural/ Peter Gabriel too.\\"<br /><br />With Afro-drum beats and charming instrumentals, it's hard to feel anything but happy when listing to this album. Leader singer Ezra Koenig's pleasant vocals along with the calming melody of the album will surprise you throughout. You'll find yourself tapping your foot along to the beat and quickly singing along.<br /><br />As we slowly transition into Spring, VW is a welcome musical change and seemingly fits the emotional and natural transition.
0743289684|5.0|This book was so well-written that I didn't even realize I was being educated on the history of the complicated country that is Somalia. Hirsi brings to light how women in Islam are really being treated, but also how they are raised to submit to this treatment as their fate. I learned a lot about Islam.  I could barely put it down until I reached the last page. Then I read it again. She inspired me to become educated on the forgotten continent of Africa, as well as the current situation between western Europe and its immigrants.

B000OYC3J8|5.0|There is apparently an opinion, common among certain highly educated musicians, that the White Stripes can't play.    This reminds me of the old complaint that Thelonious Monk couldn't play piano.  It's true that he couldn't play everything, the way his friend, neighbour and colleague Bud Powell could play anything placed in front of him.  Monk didn't need to be able to play everything, because he was wise enough and genius enough to only play what he wanted to.  A DJ once said on air that Monk's style was based on playing wrong notes.  Monk rang the radio station and informed them 'Piano ain't got no wrong notes.'  Jack White plays guitar as though guitar ain't got no wrong notes.    Similarly, the White Stripes are brilliant musicians because their technique is absolutely spot-on for what they want to do.  There are Berklee-educated shred merchants out there who secretly wish they could come up with the riffs that Jack White can rattle off effortlessly.  Ted Kirkpatrick, of the Christian metal band Tourniquet, is a phenomenally gifted player, but he is nothing like as good a musician as Meg White - partly because he has the bad taste to play Christian metal, but mostly because he thinks that good drumming is about lots of intricate polyrhythms and hitting things as fast and as much as possible.  It isn't.    This is one of my favourite White Stripes albums - loud, raucous, perverse, more Led Zep II than Zed Lep III.  I am a guitar player (rock, punk, blues and am studying jazz at a fairly advanced level) and I am in awe of how eloquent the White Stripes' music is, compared to some more ballyhooed stuff I've had to listen to.
B00122M2QU|5.0|Roadrunner Records has added more metal to their catalog and has brought forth the debut of a reunion of the Cavalera brothers, Max and Igor. Over a decade has passed since the two have shared a stage or made music together. This project is not only special because of the musical connections these Brazilian brothers share, but also because the wait for their reunion is over. Whether or not this project becomes permanent is unknown, for Max has his main band Soulfly and Igor has his electronic music project Mixhell.<br /><br />The two co-founded Sepultura over twenty years ago and have now founded another thrash metal band, Cavalera Conspiracy. Marc Rizzo (Soulfly) and Joe Duplantier (Gojira) fill out the band on guitar and bass, respectively. Without even hearing a single note from these guys, you'd expect something heavy and possibly similar to Sepultura or Soulfly - and you'd be right on all accounts. The band's debut, Inflikted, features an opening song with the same title that sounds like it came off Sepultura's [[ASIN:B000000H3Z Beneath the Remains]]. This song could start a riot and could very well be an opening song on tour because of the madness it can stir. On the other hand, the very next song, \\"Sanctuary,\\" sounds like it came off Soulfly's [[ASIN:B0001L5NNC Prophecy]].<br /><br />With comparisons to the aforementioned bands obvious, Inflikted is also a unique assault of its own. The sound is more than just cohesion of the members' past musical endeavors. Expect several different shades of red on this paint palette. Igor's drums are thunderous and intense, and easily complement the squealing guitars and Max's deep, scratchy vocals. Songs like \\"Ultra-Violent\\" and \\"Must Kill\\" are trains with a destinations of destruction, bearing chugging guitars and restless screams as their passengers. \\"Ultra-Violent\\" also features Rex Brown of Down on bass.

B0015KO52S|1.0|First of all I have no beef with Jack White, second of all I am not an obsessed fan like the rest of the reviewers appear to be. This record is not a good record, still this record will sell because of the White Stripes huge fan-base who will buy anything and everything Jack White produces. I thought the first Raconteurs album mediocre and was hoping for some progression/improvement with this one, I am disappointed on both counts.  What made the Raconteurs different from the White Stripes is the equal division of labour between Benson and White, this gave the Band hope of being something other than a WS spin-off. Sadly White dominates this second album, which for all those in love with him with or obsessed with his 'rock-God' status will make it a good album.     The truth is it is weak, extremely unoriginal, filled with cringing clichés, it is the kind of music that back in the 70s initiated the punk movement, and I know this will be unpopular with the Jack White adoring masses but there is nothing alternative, indie, original, progressive about this album, it is frivolous soft rock, with ridiculous posturing guitar solos. What's more it appears to have been thrown together in a hurry to capitalise on the Raconteurs popularity before it evaporates with the passage of time. The same goes for the Salute Video from this album, thrown together from a photo-shoot - TRY HARDER RACONTEURS.     I note with interest that the reviewer who gave one star has received several offensive comments, this is not in the spirit of reviewing a record. EVERYONE is entitled to say what they think and it is quite amusing to me that the 5 star supporters are so defensive that this album might receive criticism, it makes me wonder whether they aren't taking it all a bit too personally. OBJECTIVITY RULES!

This is an enormous book, as well is \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", but I just couldn't put it down.<br />I haven't enjoyed 2 books as much as these in quite a long time.  Granted, it's somewhat of a Medievel Soap Opera.....but oh my, what a good one!  You get hooked, that's for sure.  In beginning these 2 tomes, I would have never thought that a writer could keep me interested over the course of 2000 pages (both books), but he did just that and I'm still wanting more!
B00005AG7K|1.0|My daughter is a big Beatles fan as am I, so I was excited to find this. I had seen MMT several years ago and knew it wasn't the highest quality image to begin with so I wasn't expecting it to be pristine.  Unfortunately the quality of the image is worse than I expected.  It is washed out, blurry in parts and almost unwatchable.  It looks like a bad transfer from video tape where the video tape was a bad copy.  The packaging looks like it was done on a color copier.  The only positive aspect was the sound was good (not great) Luckily my daughter thinks anything made before 2000 is ancient so wasn't bothered by the image as long as the music was okay.    All in all I wouldn't recommend this product.  Hopefully this will be remastered and rereleased someday.
B0000029D1|4.0|This is a very solid piece by arguably the best \\"jazz/fusion/rock\\" bassist of all time........add funk as well, I am not the biggest jazz fan but was originally drawn to Stanley by his fusion works of the mid to late 70's. He is surrounded here by an allstar lineup, very nice....and guess what? He's playing some old standards that are tried and true, but like any artist each offering is invariably different and to me that is a good thing. He has taken a beating in so many reviews for \\"not matching his early works\\". Do NOT forget his career survived the 80's, an era where most musicians \\"gave in\\" order to continue on while keeping the record company people happy in a pop culture we look back at with loathing. Stanley like all musicians grew and his sound changed, sometimes we don't like the change but that's life, he's not gonna crank out a \\"Life Suite\\" or \\"Rock'N'Roll Jelly\\" on every disc. If you don't own his early discs, GET THEM!!!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I along with others waited paitintly for the movie to come out. When I went to see it, I was really disappointed along with my friends. The only way that they can salvage this film is to make a part 2 based on where it left off and use some better actors, a dialogue and a steadier camera. Reminded me of some of the old Grade \\"B\\" movies made in the 50's and 60's that I have watched. I guarantee you that unless you are a photojounalist and this was your paycheck, that there is no way you would continue to shoot and hold onto a camera when you are crapping your pants to get away and save your life.
6305388458|5.0|Nothing is sacred to the Monty Python gang. Proving this point is the hilariously irreverent Life of Brian, about a hapless Judean born on Christmas in the stall next to Jesus. He joins the People's Front of Judea, who hate the Romans (but not quite as much as they hate the splitters in the Judean People's Front!), and tries to fend off the multitudes who insist he's the messiah.<br /><br />Life of Brian is an extremely funny and quotable satire. It's not so much a parody of Christianity or the Jesus story, though, as a satire poking fun at the universally human tendency to join religious or social movements and miss the point entirely. It's funny precisely because it's so true. In one scene, as Brian flees his zealous followers, he leaves behind a shoe, which becomes the center of a heated argument over whether to revere the shoe or the gourd Brian got rid of earlier. Later in the movie, Brian addresses the multitudes:<br /><br />Brian: Please, please, please listen! I've got one or two things to say.<br />The Crowd: Tell us! Tell us both of them!<br />Brian: Look, you've got it all wrong! You don't NEED to follow ME, You don't NEED to follow ANYBODY! You've got to think for your selves! You're ALL individuals!<br />The Crowd: Yes! We're all individuals!<br />Brian: You're all different!<br />The Crowd: Yes, we ARE all different!<br /><br />The People's Front of Judea couldn't be a more appropriate parody of the sillier aspects of radical movements, including the factions of the modern-day Middle East. The time they spend squabbling amongst themselves and drafting resolutions, rather than fighting the external foe, quite comically hits the nail on the head.<br /><br />This is a great movie for anyone who loves British comedy, particularly the random zaniness that is trademark Monty Python.

0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's book, A New Earth, clearly brings home both old and new points that helps us manage our humaness and our beingness.  When I was a psychology major, I learned the concept of convergent validity:  when you get the same answer/results from different sources or data, that is a form of validation.  His first book, the power of now, sets the framework for a new earth where he continues to operationalize how the ego interacts with our awareness of the now.  I first learned about the power of now in the Seth books, and Buddah showed us how being aware is fundamental to everything.  I'm getting the messages again in slightly different ways, and this helps me clarify.  I highly recommend the book

B00132D808|3.0|Let me start off by saying this album is good, but...  it sounds just like every other group out right now.      They sound like a cross between the old Panic! and the Beatles.  I wouldn't be so disappointed with this album had Panic! at the Disco not developed their own distinct sound previously.  Their old sound was so refreshing to hear compared to all the other bands at the time.  I still listen to their last cd.  Their original sound is why most people the cd immediately after it was released.    I have plenty other groups like Andrew Bird, The Honorary Title and Melee etc. that sound great and yet don't really have any songs that you can turn up loud in your car, when you are rolling with the sunroof open and the windows down.    If you don't believe me about the sound, then click on all the sound clips offered here on Amazon.  It is a perfect snapshot of what you get:  Good, but never intense... I mean never.    In all honesty they replaced their exclamation point from their name and added violins, brass and other instruments, while slowing down the tempo.    No cuss words, no hooks, no great lyrics, no \\"panic\\" to their pace!      Was the studio under water?  Were they on Valium?

B000M5AKP8|5.0|This is the best single CD Elvis greatest hits collection available.  It includes Elvis' biggest hits from the US and UK.  All the songs on this set hit number 1 in either the US or UK or both, including the remix of his classic \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" which went to number 1 in the UK (and stayed there for 4 weeks) and several other countries in 2002.  This set spans almost his entire career from his first international hit in 1956, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", right on through the last single to be released before his death in 1977, \\"Way Down\\".  In between you get classics like \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"All Shook Up\\", \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\", \\"In the Ghetto\\", \\"Suspicious Minds\\", and \\"Burning Love\\"!  Just about every song is a classic.  If you buy only one Elvis CD, this should be it.  Highly recommended!

B00004TJKI|5.0|Anatomy of a Murder (Otto Preminger, 1957)<br /><br />To call Anatomy of a Murder the definitive courtroom film is, perhaps, not going quite far enough. Sure, there had been others, and there are certainly other classic courtroom dramas, but Anatomy of a Murder seems to be the basis for the outpouring of courtroom films and TV shows we have today; the bickering of the lawyers, the badgering of the witnesses, the bamboozling of the jury.<br /><br />The plot is very straightforward, compared to Law and Order or CSI: a man (Ben Gazzara) kills his wife (Lee Remick)'s rapist. A down-on-his-luck lawyer, Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is handed the case soon after he lost the county prosecutor election to Claude Dancer (George C. Scott). Biegler takes the case, as much to get one up on Dancer as for the case itself, but while things, as Biegler believed, are not as open-and-shut as they seem, there's far more to the case than he originally thought, and none of it seems to be on his side.<br /><br />It should go without saying that courtroom-drama-TV-show fans should consider this a must-see, but even if you never once watch Jerry Orbach flip a badge or William Petersen crack wise, this is a bang-up movie. The bast are phenomenal, every last one of them, and Wendell Mayes' script (adapted from Robert Traver's novel) is top-notch. Nowadays, the direction looks very familiar; that's because it's been done so much since. Despite that, however, the film still looks fresh and exciting. (My hypothesis is that this is because the film is in black and white, and we're used to seeing it in color with deodorant commercials interrupting it every fifteen minutes.) It's witty, it's intelligent, and it's got a cracking good mystery. Besides, how can you not like a film that was banned in Chicago? **** ½

B000O599ZS|2.0|The Searchers (John Ford, 1956)<br /><br />It seems to be the consensus among reviewers that the climax of The Searchers says something about Ethan Edwards that I don't see. In order to address that, this review is going to be laden with spoilers; if you haven't seen the movie yet and plan to, stop reading. There is no way for me to express my deep dissatisfaction with this film without talking about it, so I'm going to.<br /><br />The story: Ethan Edwards (John Wayne), a somewhat mysterious figure, turns up at the house of his brother Aaron (Walter Coy) and sister-in-law Martha (Dorothy Jordan). Ford wastes no time in getting us understanding that this is not the John Wayne we know and love; he harbors feelings for his sister-in-law, he seems to still be fighting the Civil War, and, in what may be the most quoted line from the film (at least in the reviews I've read of it), the local law says Ethan \\"fits a lot of descriptions\\". Welcome, antihero. Ethan is not at all a likable man; aside from (probably) being lawless, he's also an inveterate racist who hates Indians so much that he shuns he nephew Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter) for being one-eighth Comanche-- this despite Ethan, as a child, having saved Martin from the attack that killed his family, and having left Martin with Aaron and Martha to raise when Ethan went off to war. Things get worse when, while Ethan and Martin are out pursuing a band of Cherokee raiders, those same raiders turn back and massacre Aaron and his family, with the exception of youngest daughter Debbie (played as a young woman by Natalie Wood), whom they kidnap. After a few days, the search party gives up; Ethan is determined to continue on alone, but Martin insists on going with him. Eventually, Martin stays on the trail with him not only to help him search, but because he's afraid that Ethan's hatred of the Comanche may also visit itself on Debbie.<br /><br />The crux of the film, obviously, is Ethan's racism. (To play devil's advocate, he does have some reason-- early in the film, it's revealed that Comanches killed Ethan's mother-- yet even this is undercut by a statement in the film, mentioned in passing, that there are many different bands of Comanche.) Much is made of the fact that Ethan, once Debbie's situation is fully revealed, considers Debbie alternately as a Comanche herself or, when he thinks of her as white, as \\"a Comanche buck's squaw\\"; the inference is obvious (and, in the fifties, when miscegenation was still illegal in many parts of the country, probably resounded with audiences). So what is it that happens in that climax? Is Ethan's decision to rescue Debbie instead of killing her indicative of a change of heart? Even Martin doesn't see it coming; when he loses track of Ethan in the big battle, his first priority is tracking Ethan down and protecting Debbie from him. Right up to the bitter end, Ethan has traded on his hatred of Indians. This \\"change of heart\\" comes out of the blue, and with the information we're given, it's roughly as believable as a flock of purple elephants charging in to save the day. Even worse, there's no evidence offered after the fact that Ethan has had a change of heart; the movie ends very soon after.<br /><br />There is no doubt, however, that both Ford and cinematographer Winton Hoch were consummate filmmakers. The movie has the same striking look of most of Ford's films; all this nastiness is quite beautifully, if starkly, presented. Insert commentary here on the landscape reflecting Ethan's outlook on things; it's dry, sparsely-furnished, almost entirely barren of life. Even the band of Comanche Ethan and Martin are tracking down are nomads; nothing can survive on that plain for a long period of time; that way lies madness (cf. Sjostrom's The Wind). From a purely technical point of view, this is, in fact, a great achievement in American film history, and I understand why so many people seem so anxious to make sure it stays well within the lists of theall-time great films. As well, it has been remarkably influential, with its basic plot cropping up in everything from Taxi Driver to Star Wars, and crossing media to furnish Buddy Holly with one of his most famous songs (\\"That'll be the Day\\", inspired by Ethan's repeated use of the phrase). And yet, despite all this, I can't get past such a basic deficiency in the script.<br /><br />As well, as Roger Ebert points out in his review, this does seem like two different films that were cobbled together; there's the obsessive, bleak movie about Ethan Edwards' tracking down the Comanche, and then there's a comedy/musical flick that seems to have gotten tossed in somewhere along the way, with a subplot involving Martin's fianc&eacute;e Laurie Jorgensen (Vera Miles) and her scatterbrained family. The pieces of the two plots don't quite fit together, and what emerges from the cracks is a rather foul odor of decay. It has been opined in more than one review I've read that the comedic portions of the film may have been added in order to lighten the depressing main plot; problem is they just didn't mix in well, and this souffle ended up falling before it ever got out of the oven.<br /><br />An incredibly difficult film to rate, with some parts of it being so striking and others being so bad. Ultimately, I ended up looking more at the bad side, as I can't see myself watching this movie again any time soon. **t has been remarkably influential, with its basic plot cropping up in everything from Taxi Driver to Star Wars, and crossing media to furnish Buddy Holly with one of his most famous songs (\\"That'll be the Day\\", inspired by Ethan's repeated use of the phrase).

B00005JO20|4.0|King Kong (Peter Jackson, 2005)<br /><br />I have to admit that I didn't really expect to like Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong; aside from not being a huge fan of the original (and I realize this is heresy for someone who's been a hardcore monster movie fan for almost forty years now), I wasn't entirely sure that Jackson, who really kind of got out of the monster movie business over a decade ago, could go back and make a good old-fashioned monster movie. More fool me; King Kong is everything a remake should be, and isn't everything that the glut of pale, unnecessary, and/or stupid recent remakes has been.<br /><br />What Jackson did with Kong was not to \\"re-imagine\\" it (as so many directors have recently been doing with horror films, much to their detriment; the remake of The Hills Have Eyes is testament to just how wrong these things can go) as to amplify the original; the movie runs almost twice the length of Merian C. Cooper's 1933 opus, but not because Jackson added subplots or what have you. He simply extended scenes (and, in one notable case, added a scene that is the subject of legend, deleted from the original after audiences had an averse reaction to it). The things pared from the original film were pared because they hinted at racism (Charlie the cook is still here, but he's now known as Choy, and has a much smaller role). And, aside from one other change, the resulting product is remarkably faithful to Cooper's original film, but is, in every respect, bigger. The effects are wonderful, and since this is a movie whose main attraction is the effects (and always was, even in 1933), that's the strongest recommendation I can give it.<br /><br />There is, however, that one change, and that's where Jackson's Kong becomes problematic. In the original, there was the big ape, and there was Ann Darrow (Fay Wray/Naomi Watts). Ape meets girl, ape falls for girl, girl is scared of ape, girl comes to see that ape isn't such a bad guy after all. The difference is that there was never a time in the original where Ann Darrow wasn't scared of Kong. Here, however, once Darrow comes to the realization that, hey, apes have feelings too, she obviously develops feelings for him as well. Now, this isn't a case of girl falls in love with ape, but girl obviously considers ape to be a thinking, rational being, and is alternately terrified and disgusted by the humans' actions towards the ape. This makes perfect sense given the attitude of humans towards animals in the two time frames when these two versions of the film were made. (I haven't seen the '76 remake of Kong in way too long, and so can't rope it into the discussion here.) This change in Darrow's character makes perfect sense, and for most of the film's length, I was all set to say that it's one of the changes that make this a better film than the original. Unfortunately, that all falls apart at the very end; the change in Darrow's reaction to Kong makes the immortal final line, which is delivered here verbatim from the original script, more confusing than anything. Now, I'm going to assume that everyone and their mothers has seen one version of Kong or another and expound on this, but on the off-chance you've been living on Skull Island for the past eighty years, and have never seen any version of King Kong, skip the next paragraph, which contains spoilers.<br /><br />\\"It was beauty killed the beast.\\" When Ann Darrow is still terrified of Kong, it makes sense. In one of the most memorable scenes form the original film, Kong, loose in New York, finds Ann Darrow and abducts her. Kong's whole idea is to get Darrow and go off somewhere that people aren't flying things around and shooting at him, so the two of them can live in peace, even if Darrow's not on board with that idea. All well and good, but it's Darrow's resistance, at least in part, that brings about Kong's death. In this version, however, Darrow's all about saving the ape. He doesn't abduct her-- she goes off and finds him, and tries to stop the airplanes by putting herself out there and yelling at them. (The idea of a five-foot-something woman shielding a twenty-five-foot ape with her body is ludicrous in the extreme, but it somehow works here; the pathos Jackson evokes in this scene is remarkable.) You get the idea that Darrow would be perfectly happy to cross the East River and, say, take up residence in the New Jersey Pine Barrens with her simian pal. Sorry, Pete, but this time, it was the airplanes.<br /><br />Okay, now that the rest of you have joined us, I've focused entirely too much on Naomi Watts (who is wildly inconsistent in her acting abilities, honestly, but really does an excellent job here) and Andy Serkis (who is not at all inconsistent in his acting abilities, and for whom I have an undying love) and not said a word about the rest of the cast. Another reason I avoided this movie is because I don't think it would be possible to stick together a bunch of actors I'm less inclined to want to see in a movie. (Oh, wait, someone did-- Horton Hears a Who. Steve Carrell and Jim Carrey in the same movie?) Adrien Brody is a good actor, but he takes the most godawful roles. Jack Black is not a good actor, and he, too, takes the most godawful roles. Jamie Bell? I got allergic to him after Billy Elliott. Thomas Kretschmann is a brilliant actor (viz. Der Untergang), but, like Brody, winds up in movies that are just painful to watch (viz. Immortel: Ad Vitam). And yet all of them have renewed my faith in their acting abilities in this movie-- yes, even Jack Black. His name on a film will not be an automatic \\"no\\" any more (the way Jim Carrey's or Steve Carrell's is). How did Peter Jackson manage to yank these performances out of these actors? I have no idea. But he did it. And he stuck them in a three-hour movie that plays faster than many two-hour movies I've seen. The start's a little slow, yeah, but once you get into it, wow. Jackson does, most certainly, still know how to direct a monster movie. And, with a few missteps, he certainly did a fine job on this one. *** ½s by putting herself out there and yelling at them.

And yet all of them have renewed my faith in their acting abilities in this movie-- yes, even Jack Black. His name on a film will not be an automatic \\"no\\" any more (the way Jim Carrey's or Steve Carrell's is). How did Peter Jackson manage to yank these performances out of these actors? I have no idea. But he did it. And he stuck them in a three-hour movie that plays faster than many two-hour movies I've seen. The start's a little slow, yeah, but once you get into it, wow. Jackson does, most certainly, still know how to direct a monster movie. And, with a few missteps, he certainly did a fine job on this one. *** ½
0380778556|5.0|Among the hundreds of thousands of books that have been published - and even among the few hundred that might truly considered classic novels - there are only a relative handful that can be recognized by their opening lines.  \\"Call me Ishmael.\\"  \\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\\"  Not far behind such memorable openers is \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\": the first sentence of Daphne Du Maurier's Rebecca.<br /><br />Manderley is the large English estate of Maxim de Winter, a home that has been in the family for many generations.  As the story opens, however, it is in ruins and the narrator - Maxim's second wife - recalls how it got that way, making most of the novel a flashback.  It starts in Monte Carlo where the narrator (who's given name is never provided) first meets Maxim.  He is a forty-two year old man widowed for a year; she is a naïve twenty-one year old who falls for him.  The love, fortunately, is mutual, and they quickly get married and return to Manderley.<br /><br />Manderley is haunted by the ghost of Rebecca, Maxim's first wife.  Not haunted in a supernatural fashion but rather a psychological one.  The memories of her pervade the home and are kept alive by the stern head housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers.  For the second Mrs. DeWinter, adjustment to married life is difficult enough, but Mrs. Danvers - who adored Rebecca - also has her sly ways of making things even harder.  There are also secrets about Rebecca and Maxim that cause problems and which, when revealed, could be disastrous.<br /><br />Although I am not very fond of nameless narrators (it usually comes off as a gimmick rather than necessary), in Rebecca, it works.  The narrator starts out as a girl with no real identity; it is only after she become Mrs. DeWinter that she has a chance to really blossom.  And as a side note, it is also a classic movie, Alfred Hitchcock's one film that won Best Picture. Although seventy years old, Rebecca continues to be an enjoyable and accessible read, worthy of the title \\"classic.\\"
0783229526|1.0|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (Terry Gilliam, 1998)<br /><br />When you get Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro in the same movie, and then get Terry Gilliam to direct it, you set yourself up for an exceptionally high-quality film. When that film is based on the writings of Hunter S. Thompson, you seen almost predestined for true greatness. Why is it, then, that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas fails on almost every level? Simple: because the insanely convoluted script (the story of the genesis of which is even more insanely convoluted than the script itself) takes Thompson's bitter, crazed, hysterically funny satire of American life and turns it into a generic, intensely stupid drug comedy. Granted, it's one with an incredible cast and a usually brilliant director, but make no mistake, 12 Monkeys or Brazil this ain't.<br /><br />Depp plays Raoul Duke, Hunter Thompson's alter ego, while del Toro is Dr. Gonzo, Thompson's traveling companion and legal aid. (I had always assumed Dr. Gonzo to be based on cartoonist Ralph Steadman, thanks to Thompson's wonderful Kentucky Derby essay, in which Steadman behaves exactly like, well, Dr. Gonzo; the liner notes inform me that Gonzo is instead based on Oscar Zeta Acosta.) They roll into Vegas to cover the Mint 400, a dirt-bike race, and miss everything but the very start thanks to their heavy ingestion of controlled (and uncontrolled) substances. After losing Gonzo along the way, Duke flees Vegas, only to find out, when he calls Gonzo from a pay phone, that Gonzo has set him up another assignment-- covering a police convention focused on what we now know as the War on Drugs. There's a potential vein of humor here that cannot be overstated. Somehow, Gilliam's (and Tony Girsoni's and Tod Davies' and Alex Cox's) script misses it entirely.<br /><br />It's impossible to watch Johnny Depp on a screen and not like him, but this is about as close as I've ever come. (Okay, it's tied with Secret Window.) And I've seen del Toro play drugged-out maniacs before and liked it a lot better. Usually, either of them can save even the most wooden script, though I admit even del Toro's remarkable talent couldn't help The Way of the Gun. So what went wrong here? I think a great deal of the problem is that Gilliam, in both the script (though how much of it he's actually responsible for we'll probably never know) and the direction, takes Thompson's source material far too seriously. (It's telling that the funniest line in the movie was actually ad-libbed by Gary Busey.) Fifteen minutes in, the movie has already become repetitive-- take drugs. Attempt to be funny. Take drugs. Attempt to be funny. Repeat ad nauseam, sometimes literally. All the ingredients are here for this to have been a great movie. There's a cast of thousands, many of whom are instantly recognizable (aside from the above, Harry Dean Stanton, Ellen Barkin, Verne Troyer, Tim Thomerson, Christina Ricci, Laraine Newman, Michael Jeter, Penn Jillette, Christopher Meloni, Lyle Lovett, and many others put in small appearances). There's a fantastic book at the heart of this. There's a brilliant director-- or, at least, one who used to be. (It's equally telling that after this, he went silent for a number of years; his next outing was the critical failure The Brothers Grimm, in 2005.) And yet somehow it all went horribly, horribly wrong. Amazon reviewer Jeff Shannon accurately predicted that the movie would \\"achieve some modest cult status over the years\\", but for the life of me, I can't understand why. *ked it a lot better.

B000N6TX1I|3.0|Children of Men (Alfonso Cuaron, 2006)<br /><br />I have to say up front that I was not a big fan of the book upon which this movie is based. Thus, I approached the film with a bit of trepidation; sometimes mediocre books make for great films, but more often than not, they don't. The good news is that Children of Men is better than the novel upon which it is based; the bad news is that it's probably not as good as it could have been.<br /><br />Cuaron (who holds three Academy Award nominations, two of them for writing, none for directing) here gives us the story of Theo Faron (Clive Owen), a minor government functionary whose ex, Julian (Julianne Moore), is involved with a resistance group in a near-future London where women have lost the ability to bear children. (As the movie opens, the youngest person on the planet, at eighteen years and change, is killed in South America.) Julian contacts Theo and asks if he can pull some strings to get a young black refugee out of Britain and into the arms of the Human Project, a much wider-ranging revolutionary group based outside the country. (Britain has become a racists' paradise; even black citizens, it is inferred, are suffering the persecution that the \\"'fugees\\" suffer openly.) Theo goes about it halfheartedly until he finds out the reason this particular girl is so important: she's the first woman in more than eighteen years to become pregnant.<br /><br />Owen and Moore both tend to be hit-or-miss actors, but they perform capably here. It helps that they're backed up by a fantastic stable of actors; Michael Caine is excellent as always, and the wonderful Peter Mullan, in a small role, absolutely steals the show. Cuaron turns an emotionless, overly talky book into a credible thriller. It's still a bit on the talky side, but is definitely faster-moving than the book. Worth a rental. ***

I loved getting to know more about this characters and getting into the head of a mafia chief. I highly recommend it!
B000LC55F2|3.0|The Prestige (Christopher Nolan, 2006)<br /><br />I remember, back at the beginning of 2006, a lot of talk about two movies with similar storylines coming out: Neil Burger's The Illusionist and Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. Both period pieces featuring magicians, with big stars I like in the lead roles (Edward Norton and Christian Bale, respectively), both with a big mystery at the forefront. Burger was a relatively new director making a big splash, while Nolan had established himself with a really, really great movie, then had turned around and tarnished his reputation with one of the worst remakes imaginable (Insomnia). Needless to say, Ladbroke's could have opened a pool on which one would be better, if there were any objective criteria for judging such a thing. (Both, as it turns out, were nominated for the Best Cinematography Oscar; both, quite deservedly, lost to El Laberinto del Fauno. The Prestige also picked up a nom for Best Art Direction. Guess what it lost to.) Well, I've now seen both, and while they're both enjoyable, I'm coming down on the side of the apes in this debate: I liked The Illusionist a lot better.<br /><br />The story concerns two magicians, Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who work their way up through the ranks as partners until a tragic onstage accident results in the death of Angier's wife Julia (Cheaper by the Dozen's Piper Perabo). The two become rivals, with their rivalry leading to Angier's own demise. This is not a spoiler; the opening scene of the movie shows us Borden being convicted of the crime. The question is, was there a crime at all? Much of the movie is told in flashback, showing us the manipulations that led to the trial.<br /><br />And this is its greatest weakness; the complex time structure of the film is in no way delineated, making it exceptionally hard to follow for much of its length. By the time you get into the rhythm of the time changes, the movie shifts back to the present. Thanks, Chris! On the upside, however, you've got an amazing stable of actors (aside from the above, a quick core sample reveals Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, David Bowie, and Ricky Jay), and they all perform at least reasonably well, while Nolan's directing still seems to be climbing back up; he still hasn't reached the pinnacle of Memento again, but he's getting there. (Interestingly, Memento is well-known for how deftly Nolan handled playing with the time element there; what happened here?) And, well, it does lack Rufus Sewell. There are very few movies that would not be improved by Rufus Sewell, who chewed so much wonderful scenery in The Illusionist.<br /><br />Still, for all that, if you can figure out the time element in The Prestige, which may take a few viewings, it's got a meaty mystery, some great emotional manipulation (by the characters, not by the director; this is a positive mark for any film coming out of emotionally-manipulative Hollywood these days), and a fun, if predictable, twist. Just remember: there are some things a cold chisel should never be used for. ***ver, you've got an amazing stable of actors (aside from the above, a quick core sample reveals Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, David Bowie, and Ricky Jay), and they all perform at least reasonably well, while Nolan's directing still seems to be climbing back up; he still hasn't reached the pinnacle of Memento again, but he's getting there.

630587493X|4.0|Bicentennial Man was a very enjoyable four star film for me. It contained comedy, drama and morality messages all in a sci-fi film setting. This film had wonderful mechanical effects. However, I enjoyed it first and foremost because of Robin Williams and don't understand what those 1 and 2 star rating people were complaining about. Robin Williams worked very hard at his performance and I think brought out qualities in Andrew that no one else could have. I think all the special effects were beautifully done and the musical score was exquisite. Frankly, this helped get me through some of the few more drawn out portions of the film.<br /><br />This is another in a long string of Hollywood robot films that quoted Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, although it didn't seem to invoke any of them too heavily in any of the plot developments. Several of the film messages are lost on me and I don't quite know what the writer was trying to say about marriage and sex defining humanity. Perhaps he wasn't saying any more about life than \\"let's try to enjoy the ride\\".<br /><br />I loved the scene in which the option of becoming \\"a complete man\\" was presented to Andrew by the robot maker and thought it was handled very well. I do know that when Andrew wished to be \\"more human\\" by being made mortal, I agreed with the robot maker. He felt that Andrew was definitely becoming more human because he was making one huge mistake.<br /><br />It is clear to me that as long as life is pleasant and not filled with intolerable pain, it is also filled with constant fascination. If I were the writer I would not have permitted Andrew to \\"check-out\\", by becoming artificially mortal.  Andrew, being above all things sentient and intelligent, should not have wished for death because his \\"life partner\\" was dying. In fact, I think he should have tried to convince his partner into extending her life by means of his biological implants. When she eventually died he could have remained behind to glorify her memory, and also could have developed devices to further extend the useful life of people and rendered other great services to humanity.<br /><br />If there was some great point the writer was trying to make about marriage and sexuality defining humanity I guess I just missed it. Although I count myself as a great fan of both, I really don't think a reasoning robot would permit his \\"humanity\\" to have been defined by such a measure or have chosen to abandon useful life and just \\"check out\\".ave developed devices to further extend the useful life of people and rendered other great services to humanity.

0896760839|4.0|This book is a nice resource to add to a costumer's or period re-enactment library, but is not for the beginner.  Ms Arnold assumes that catridge pleating, lining, and interling are all a part of a normal skills set.  Also, most of the pictures are in black and white, making it look as though they only wore black (my main frustration with Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd by the same author.)    The book does a nice job of relating the recovered garments to either the actual person's portrait wearing them or similar portraits of the time.  Some of the clothes recovered are from violent events - some details of which can be disturbing to the unprepared.    Ms Arnold has done a fantastic job of layout of recovered clothing.  With a little sewing experience, these patterns can be adapted to modern re-creation.  The details, even in black and white, can be replicated with a little imagination.  This is more of a book of details of what was done, not how to do it.  I would like to see a compendium made of details - tools how to get a certain effect in the leather work, how the corsets were made with reeds, how the pinking was done on the hanging sleeves, etc.    By and large, this book is well worth the cost.

B000002H2H|4.0|4 stars for what it is in the history of metal, 3 stars for how it now<br />compares to what it was back in the day.<br /><br />In short: when this came out, heads turned and then banged, hard. Seemed miraculously heavy at the time, but of course this looks like Romper Room now after bands like Carcass etc (none of whom do much for me after a \\"tune\\" or two). I love true heaviness, which comes (to my ears) from extreme tightness between the drummer, bassist (kickdrum and bass locked in tight over the riff, specifically) and guitars. Here we have one of the great heavy rhythm players and a fine metal drummer.<br /><br />But Lars and James are only half of this band. Kirk is WAY overrated as a lead player, very prosaic and uninspired, miles from someone like Randy Rhoads. And man, after the decades of Cliff-worship, this album proves that legend is often myth. The bass playing here is merely average, truly. There are dozens of heavier and tighter bassists; Cliff may have been a party monster and added to the vibe that way but his playing is average. Geddy, Geezer, Harris, etc etc etc blow him off the map.<br /><br />  That said, there are some fast and furious highlights here, but frankly everything is so on top of or ahead of the beat that it gets wearing after a few tunes. About one minute into Bell Tolls is a highlight because everybody locks in but the guitars are finally a bit back in the pocket and everything gets much heavier and fatter due to that. That's why the Black album hit so hard: producer Rock knew how to make their groove much fatter and got them focusing on melody as well as heaviness. The Black is too poppy to be real metal but is good for what it is, as is this. But neither is as good as Puppets, which has their most intense moments.<br /><br />  This is a great thrash album, but that genre gets real old if you want music as well as power. But if power and release is all you want, this will do it for you. But if you really want that, go to the various (FREEEEE!!!) Metallica tape-trading sites and get the live shows from this and later periods; that's where the real heaviness lays. Funny that the best stuff is free, ain't it? Who says life is always unfair?ading sites and get the live shows from this and later periods; that's where the real heaviness lays. Funny that the best stuff is free, ain't it?

0316113506|5.0|I like this book because it presents the research in a more objective manner than other popular press science books that I have read over the years. This book is concise and carefully refrains from sensationalism of the link between exercise and the brain. It describes groups of studies within a certain context and it presents the findings in a way that readers will be able to discern between \\"evidence\\" and \\"law\\".<br /><br />This book was fun to read because much of the content of this book contradicts my outdated education on the brain, how it develops, and how it freezes from further significant development around hormonal changes as teens. Additionally, while Piaget may describe behavior well, the inferences made about physical brain development from his ideas are also rendered obselete.<br /><br />As a matter of serendipity, I also read this book at a time when I was around 15 weeks of regular exercising after being dormant for 7 years. It really helped my confidence with the decision to make investments of time and money to exercise as many days out of the week as I could.<br /><br /> The underlying research that is in this book should be given credit and I have to take away points for not presenting the hypothesis of all the experiments presented in the book in greater detail, because a casual reader will likely infer that all the studies were conducted on behalf of the thesis of the book.<br /><br />Still, 5 Stars.

After a thousand pages the villains finally get their comeuppance, but by then the reader is sick and tired of their always being rewarded while the hard working peasants are punished.  The sex scenes are interruptions and repititious in style, and annoying in their modernity.  Briefly,  I found the \\"Pillars of Earth\\" to be an unforgettable tome;  the \\"World Without End\\" should have ended on the chopping block.  CLT/PhD
B000001FTD|5.0|This was (and still is) one of the greats in my library of thrash music. Anthrax really got into their groove on this album and everyone in the band was firing all cylinders. Heavy guitars, drums, and bass, along with Belladonna's vocals = excellent release.     Drawing themes from the horror fiction of Stephen King (\\"Among the Living\\" and \\"Skeletons in the Closet\\") and Judge Dredd comics (\\"I am the Law\\"), the band presented here a lively, unique metal sound that was quite infectious and energizing to listen to. This was one of my favorite morning wake-up calls before school, along with a Mountain Dew or a Jolt Cola (when we could find them). Good stuff!
1577314808|5.0|I finished reading The Power of Now some weeks ago and then moved onto Tolle's book, A New Earth: Awakening Your Life's Purpose. So I'm a bit mixed up considering some of the same information can be found in both books. However, The Power of Now is a great stepping stone to A New Earth... I found The Power of Now to be helpful in showing the reader how to free ones self from the mind and its constant flow of thoughts and images it presents to us, either about the past or the future, both which are illusions considering the only real moment in NOW. The content of the book can seem a bit confusing, but don't let the mind try to make the information harder then it is. Tolle also touches on the Ego and one's need for identification with form. Overall, I enjoyed the book thuroughly. It made me very much aware of the importance of the Now and gave me an opportunity to become aware and conscious of my thoughts, my ego's need for identification with form, and so much more that you'll have to read the book to understand.
B000002IOJ|5.0|This was among my favorite albums during my teen years. Alex Skolnick was one of the best guitarists in metal at the time - very underrated in my opinion. Great phrasing, passion, and technique that made not only his solos, but the most straight-forward rhythm work impressive. His riffs were quite an influence on my playing during that time period.     But it doesn't end with great guitar. Every one in Testament brought something worthwhile to the table. It was a collective act that really knew how to jam. I saw them twice in concert and they were excellent on both occasions. I'd definitely recommend this to any rock/metal fans!

B000Z27HLS|4.0|This most recent adaptation of Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey is an improvement over the rather cheesy [though still entertaining] 1986 adaptation, and is well-cast. It is rather hard to review the movie adaptations of Austen's works as too much is lost when the novel is chopped down to fit into a specific time limit, in this case about 90 minutes. But, director Jon Jones has done an admirable job of staying true to the essence of Austen's work without losing too much of its original flavor in cutting out parts of the novel.<br /><br />The casting is well-done - J.J. Feild is consummate as the 'almost handsome' Henry Tilney [though I personally found him to be quite a dish myself]. Felicity Jones plays the role of Catherine Morland to perfection -equal parts naive, and yet able to see through artifice in people. Cary Mulligan as the trampy Isabella Thorpe shows much promise and is very convincing in her role. Liam Cunningham as the mercenary General Tilney makes a compellingly brooding and villanous character. The other roles are suitably cast as well.<br /><br />There is much to commend about this adaptation besides the casting - the musical score captures the gothic feel of the novel, especially  in the fantasy sequences, and the cinematography is gorgeous. The scenes of Northanger Abbey especially truly evoke a romantic and mysterious feel, and credit surely must go to the able camerawork & direction. Considering that Jane Austen was very descriptive about Northanger Abbey in her novel, the particular attention that is paid in 'showing' the viewer the interior and exterior of the building is very much appreciated.<br /><br />Purists will have problems with the liberties taken with the novel, and I do personally feel that this production was unnecessarily sexed-up, but on the whole I do think that this is a much improved adaptation than the 1986 version, and also well-made and acted. I would highly recommend it to all Austen fans and those who love period dramas.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|As with all adaptations of Jane Austen's works, this recent version of Persuasion is by no means perfect, and purists may revile it for the liberties it takes with the novel, yet it has its strengths.<br /><br />Firstly, the storyline [for those unfamiliar with the plot] - Persuasion is a story of love lost & regained, of waiting [8 yrs in this case], and of constancy in feelings. Sally Hawkins plays Anne Elliott, who is at present a 27 year old spinster living with her father and oldest sister, with fond and poignant recollection of a long-ago romantic attachment that went sour. 8 years earlier, Anne had rejected a young naval officer, Frederick Wentworth [played by a very delectable Rupert Penry-Jones] under pressure from her disapproving family and godmother, Lady Russell [Alice Krige]. She finds herself at present having to leave her home, Kellynch due to the spendthrift nature of her father and sister, and learns that the family home is to be leased to none other than Wentworth's sister and brother-in-law. Soon, Anne's and Frederick's paths cross, and his improved fortunes make him a good catch causing Anne much anguish as she realises that society's conventions prevent her from declaring her true feelings for him, whilst watching other women fawn over him. The rest of the story deals with what happens to Anne and Frederick.<br /><br />As for the adaptation - the casting is very credibly done. In the 1995[?] version starring Amanda Roots [as Anne Elliott] and Ciaran Hinds [as Frederick Wentworth], I felt the two leads were too old for their roles, though well-played. In the latest version, Sally Hawkins not only looks the part age-wise but reveals the depth of her emotions very well, portraying with a glance or a look what she cannot say with words. Similarly, Penry-Jones makes a dashing Naval Captain, and his eyes convey so very much! One of the scenes that have stayed with me is the scene where he watches intently whilst Anne plays the piano -his eyes are absolutely riveted upon Anne and you wonder at the depth of his feelings [whilst also pondering -is he reviled by her for her past rejection of him, or as in love with her as he was 8 years ago?].<br /><br />The other actors do a credible job with their roles as well - Alice Krige as the meddlesome Lady Russell, Anthony Head as the vain and snobbish Sir Walter etc.<br /><br />The music and cinematography aptly evoke the sense of the time and places. Scenes of Bath, Lyme etc are beautifully portrayed, as is the countryside.<br /><br />However, my one real grouse with this adaptation is the last couple of minutes of this version - poor Anne Elliott is shown throwing caution and notions of propriety to the wind, and running about town looking for Frederick Wentworth! It is just unimaginable, and though I get the sense this was deliberately done to show the urgency of Anne's situation and fragile state of mind, I felt it was overdone and in bad taste [in this i much preferred the more moderate scene in the '95 version].<br /><br />But, all in all, I did like this version on the whole, and felt that it was a well-made, and well-acted production worthy of Austen fans [except perhaps purists, for obvious reasons] ,and also fans of period dramas.upon Anne and you wonder at the depth of his feelings [whilst also pondering -is he reviled by her for her past rejection of him, or as in love with her as he was 8 years ago?].

B00003CXA6|5.0|Mostly I wanted to say what a great job Richard Jordon does with Armisted.  I just now see that Jordon died of a brain tumor.  I always wondered what happened because he was a very good actor.  A wonderful swan song as Jordon was dying as he played this part.  Armisted is tormented by the war because his dear friend Win Hancock is on the other side.  Jordon plays this wonderfully.  It is so important in the Sharaa trilogy and I am thankful such a fine actor received the chance to do this.  I think Steven Lange is better cast as Pickett than he was as Jackson.  Daniels is perfect.  The whole production is very good. I can watch it over and over.  I wish Gods and Generals had been edited as well as this was.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I listened to this CD yesterday and it brought back such memories!  \\"Tapestry\\" was probably the first album I owned that I listened to and could appreciate the entire program.  Carole King, the ultimate hit-songwriter, freed me from the \\"hits.\\" And remember, \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\" and \\"It's Too Late\\" was a double-sided number one single. There are such great songs on this album: \\"Way Over Yonder,\\" \\"So Far Away,\\" \\"Home Again.\\"  Just thinking about these songs, and King's performances of them, moves me.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is one of those movies where you either love it or hate it, but once you love it you can never go back. the attention to detail is amazing, every shot is a masterpiece. the soundtrack is wonderful. the story, one about coming of age/ growing up, relates to everyone. i love this movie, and there are not many movies that i can say that i love.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I remember when I lost my mind! It was back in 2006. It wasn't when I first listened to this album--because on first listen, I only liked it. But that was only because I wasn't quite ready for it. Before long, it drove me nuts. I was bonkers, I went ga-ga, I lost myself in irrational exuberance.<br /><br />It's a hoary clich&eacute; to say something was \\"the soundtrack to my summer,\\" but this clich&eacute; rings true for this album, for my 2006 was very manic-depressive. I lost a good job and a bad one, then found one that was both. I was desperately poor but often incredibly happy; I spent many unemployed afternoons at the neighborhood coffeeshop hammering away at what I hoped would be the Great American Screenplay, and I gave serious thought to moving to Los Angeles with a U-Haul and my ego to try and sell it. I was in love with the cute 19-year-old barista, and I'd take smoke breaks with her and hang out with mutual friends at night, and we'd put on \\"St. Elsewhere\\" back-to-back, and I'd sip sober sodas while my friends got drunk and did crazy things. And usually I had no desire to live that life again, but every once in a while, that level of insanity looked fun.<br /><br />Vaguely I knew my own decisions and attitudes were none too wise. But fortunately there was an album that felt as crazy as I did.<br /><br />\\"Crazy\\" of course, ended up being this album's anthem. And it is a true classic, a song for the ages, and it has earned its rightful place on the eternal-DJ-wedding-playlist, somewhere after \\"Baby's Got Back\\" and \\"Billie Jean.\\" So I'll probably be dancing to it in my eighties, shaking my moneymaker and saying \\"I remember when I lost my mind\\" until I do, literally, lose my mind. But I must admit, \\"Crazy\\" almost drove me mad, because it distracted people from an album that is every bit as solid as its most famous song.<br /><br />Most great albums get that way by having a reasonably consistent feel. This one lacks one; it careens across the sonic landscape like a dune-buggy being driven by an over-caffeinated ferret. There are glorious Gospel-tinged melodies, heavenly and happy and reasonably wholesome, and there are also dark and sinister songs like \\"Monster\\" and \\"Online.\\" And then there's \\"Necromancer.\\" I'm tempted to say it's as outrageous a black comedy as anything since Guns n' Roses' \\"I Used to Love Her (But I had to Kill Her)\\"--but that would be unfair, because this is a much better song. In it, Cee-Lo raps about (and to) a beautiful corpse-bride. \\"Did you hear what I said? With this ring I thee wed,\\" he says, then comments: \\"She was cool when I met her, but I think I like her better dead.\\"<br /><br />There are times when the wordplay isn't quite as brilliant, but a lot of the less crafty lyrics are at least (for most of us!) easier to relate to. And best of all, Danger Mouse's beats are consistently compelling. \\"It's clearly the theory of less is more,\\" Cee-Lo says on \\"Feng Shui,\\" but here more is more; the album's so sonically schizophrenic that you can--and you will--listen to it back-to-back without feeling like it's boring you. And that's quite a feat. With a lot of other artists, even excellent ones, I will lose interest somewhere around the fifty-minute mark, look around for something different, and come back to their work whenever I get around to it. But back in 2006, it seemed like every third or fourth time I'd put something on, it was \\"St. Elsewhere.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, now it is 2008, and rather than being a relatively irresponsible late-twentysomething, I'm a relatively responsible thirtysomething. The coffeeshop has become a Mediterranean eatery, the barista is gone from my life--but not my cell phone--and I've gone through any number of other crazy infatuations since then. California remains the golden dream while I while away the days in snowy Chicago, waiting tables and writing the Great American Novel and waiting for the day I can sell it. And Gnarls Barkley have a new album, and I don't thinkit's destined for immortality, but at least I can still seek intercession from \\"St. Elsewhere.\\" It blew me away in 2006, and I can still listen to it twice without giving the matter a second thought, and I have the feeling it'll be just as good in 2016, or 2056.k intercession from \\"St. Elsewhere.\\" It blew me away in 2006, and I can still listen to it twice without giving the matter a second thought, and I have the feeling it'll be just as good in 2016, or 2056.
0525950079|3.0|I have just finished Ken Follet's World Without End.  I literally had to force myself  to doggedly finish this book because I am too stubborn to give up on something I have invested so much time reading.  Pillars Of The Earth is one of the best books I have ever fallen in love with.  I have read it over and over.  It seems to me that Follet could never have written a sequel to a nearly flawless novel and I give him much credit for trying.     I just couldn't wrap my arms around these characters.       Caris, the daughter of the town's prosperous wool merchant although a strong willed woman was too indecisive, and Merthin, the talented builder of bridges and churches to be not particularly likeable. Ralph, the vicious, ambitious nobleman was wicked and pitable but not a strong enough to be the villain you love to hate. Gwenda, the serf was strong willed was long suffering and the strongest of the principals. After awhile the bond that initially linked them all fairly faded to gray.     Follet tried the same type of relationships with his principals that worked very well in POE, but it didn't work for me here.     Follet put a tremendous amount of research into this tome for those who are fascinated by this grim period of medieval history. The Bubonic plague was a tempest that wiped out thousands of people as it kept sweeping through Euorope until it finally ended and was displayed in realistic detail.     I think the story would have benefited by some pruning of a couple of hundred pages.         Many folks have criticized the graphic sex scenes, but honestly it was accurate for the times and I don't feel that it detracted anything.    Most 1000 page books I feel sad to see end, I couldn't wait to get to the end of this one. I was hoping to like it more as it neared the end, but sadly, I didn't.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Set during the mid-Victorian age, this fictional story not only reveals the stresses of human relationships, but of the social/geographical/economic divide. The lead female character - Margaret Hale (Daniela Denby-Ashe), is a middle class southerner from the town of Helstone, a somewhat picturesque country community. The lead male character - John Thornton (Richard Armitage), is a mill-owner from the northern town of Milton, an industrial town where machines are heard everywhere and smoke fills the sky. Amidst the ideological struggles between a laid back southern girl and an industrial northern man, a love story unfolds....<br /><br />I read the book by Elizabeth Gaskell AFTER I had watched this DVD. I love both versions and long ago realized that everything written does not always translate well to the screen, that there will always be some differences. All in all, this is one of my favorites!<br /><br />[also reviewed on my blog \\"My Personal Reviews\\"]
0307387178|4.0|In reading other reviews here, I see a lot of criticism of both the author and the subject of this book.  I found especially interesting the review written by Chris's college classmate, who although admittedly didn't know him well, has some revealing observations.  Was the book well written? Absolutely - the author gathers and presents a lot of material in an effort to explain the Why behind Chris McCandless's journey, and tells the story in a very effective way.  I was haunted for days by this book.  Was Krakauer truly objective in his portrayal of Chris?  Maybe not - Krakauer does seem to identify with Chris, having experienced a contentious relationship with his own father and a few close calls during his attempt on Devil's Thumb (funny that a few chapters meant to convince us of the author's unique insight and authority can have the opposite effect).  Being in the hands of such an author puts us in a tricky spot, doesn't it?      I previously stated in this review that I thought Chris was wracked by guilt and suicidal, but upon further consideration I realize that's a bit too simplistic.  Chris was driven to test himself in such an extreme way that I thought he was seeking punishment, but it simply seems to me now that he suffered an unfortunate and deadly combination of idealism, determination, hubris, and rebellion.  Certainly the fact that I continue to think about Chris McCandless weeks after finishing the book is itself a testament to the power of this story.  Would I recommend this book?  Yes.  Does it make you think?  Yes.  You will instinctively compare your life and values with Chris's and most probably get frustrated, but it is an edifying experience.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Just watched it.  Wow.  I have been a fan of Stephen King for some time and \\"The Mist\\" is my favorite story from him so i had to see the film.  I dont want to give anything away but the premise of the story is easy.  A big storm hits forcing people to go into town and pack into the supermarket for food and supplies.  A mist soon appears and it is soon revealed that there are creatures in the mist.  Soon a small group of people decide that they must leave and see if anything is left beyond the mist.  So they make a run for it.  That is all i will tell you.  Some people say ughh the ending ruined the movie so on so forth.  I loved the ending!!!!  I havent seen a more shocking ending in years.  Im talking edge of your seat, yelling at the tv kinda ending!!!  I absolutely loved this movie and feel they did justice to the short novella that was great to begin with.  Any fan of Stephen King and/or horror must see this movie.
0143038419|1.0|What a frustrating read! It is absolutely amazing to me that this woman is making tons of money on this novel on her narcissism. I don't believe half of what she writes - I believe she wrote it all to have a paid vacation. Appauling!!!
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|This album is BRILLIANT!!!! When listening to this album throw away all the perceptions you have of her personal life and listen to the album for what it is...MUSIC!!! It's obvious that she's no Whitney, Mariah or Christina so for all the people who were looking for powerhouse vocals came looking in the wrong direction. Britney has the perfect voice for the cute catchy pop songs that launched her career. These songs still have her signature pop sound but they're catchier, edgier, and dangerously addictive (I'm no Britney fan but the music is so alluring...almost like a guilty pleasure) No one wants to hear deep subconcious meaningful songs with powerful messages ALL the time. Sometimes you just want to dance and have fun...and if you're looking for that then Blackout is the album for you.  I only gave it 4 stars because the energy slips a bit in the middle but it's still Surprisingly and exceptionally good.
B000UB15C6|5.0|This album is a must have for any monk fan.Great bassists who could really get through monks  intricate  writing,great horns sonny rollins, etc.They say this was hard one for the muscians to play because of its tempo changes and stylings.Never the less it was done,GREAT JOB!

B000NA2BEU|4.0|One of the latest critically-acclaimed, but rarely watched (and thusly canceled), shows. Original, gripping, intelligent, and persnickety, Veronica Mars is part noir, part teen drama, and completely awesome. Although the third season isn't quite as good as the first two seasons, this is still a must have for any Veronica Mars fan. The DVDs from Amazon came in perfect condition. They also have a handy play-all feature, which is probably the bane of my parents' existence, as it's quite easy to intend to watch one episode and then realize it's been four hours since you started....

6305692572|2.0|I thought this was going to be a romantic comedy, but was disappointed to find this a dark and depressing drama.  It is a story about how being an alcoholic can affect a family and the journey they have to take to stay together.  Meg Ryan and Andy Garcia play a married couple, and Meg is the one with the alcohol addiction.  The saying about hitting rock bottom would definitely apply to this film.  The audience sees Meg slowly spiral completely out of control, and how low she has to go until she finally is ready to reach out for help.  Her family has to come to terms with the fact that she will not be the same person she was as a drunk.  When Meg emerges from rehab, everyone is on edge with her - not only her family, but friends and acquaintances too.  Everyone has adjustments to make.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|This movie was a fun escape for my wife and I.  It is a heart warming tale.  If you're looking for reality or documentary, this isn't for you.  If your looking for a story about the importance of connections and following your dreams, I recommend it.    Some really awesome music.    I personally thought it was great.
B0000640VN|4.0|What a charming pair Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman make!  This romantic comedy is about the Duke of Albany, and while hosting a party in 1876 he notices someone that doesn't belong at his party.  When he follows him, he literally like \\"Alice\\" falls into the rabbit hole and travels through time to the year 2001.  Stuart Besser found this hole thru time making time travel possible, and he takes it upon himself to introduce the Duke to the future while trying to find a way to get him back where he belongs.  When Leopold meets former Besser girlfriend Kate, they can't help but fall in love.      Yes, this is a completely predictable movie, but so what!  It is the ultimate in romance, and we all need to dream a little bit.
0452289963|1.0|This is the worst book I've read in a long, long time. Basically he takes already known Buddhist ideas and presents them as his own. This book is not \\"new age\\" like I was led to believe before I bought it. It's a Buddhist book with Buddhist ideas.<br /><br />This book did absolutely nothing to \\"awaken\\" me to my life's purpose.<br />If you want to find your purpose, read something like the book \\"Earth Angels\\" or \\"ET: 101\\". Those are two fantastic books.<br /><br />I regret buying this book, and warn you: don't buy it if you don't like boring rehashed ideas. Don't waste your money.
B000WC3AJE|5.0|A great trilogy for older folks who remember the great MGM musicals. Has snippets and scenes that will bring back fond memories of great musicals. Younger people will find these \\"documentaries\\" an interesting and enjoyable introduction to some of the finest musical films produced in the past.... in these days of CGI, there's a lot more to offer with real people.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This was bought as a gift and the person I bought it for liked it very much.  I haven't seen it myself.
B000002G23|5.0|I first started listening to The Police when I was in middle high school and never got tired of them. Most of the songs on this CD set reminded me of specific times throughout my middle to high school years.They also became subjects of conversations I had with friends in college about the bands we listened to while in high school. The Police still rocks!
1881273156|5.0|This book was wonderful. It not only helped to strengthen my husband and my marriage, but it gets you to thinking about the other relationships in your life and how you can strengthen those. I recommend this book to everyone. It was fabulous!
1400082773|5.0|It was a wonderful book to read by a person who actually lives out his life as a biracial American. The writing was very striking because he speaks truthfully of the events which went on in his youth. I enjoyed reading it.

1582701709|2.0|Offers some decent principles about the \\"rights and wrongs\\" of life ... and puts a pop culture spin on the old adage that you are in control of your own destiny.     A little too over the top for me to get more than 3/4 of the way through the book.
0679746323|3.0|I just finished reading Mao: \\"The Unknown Story\\" and think that the author definitley got her point across at portraying Mao for more or less who he was. The problem that I had with this book is the same problem more eloquently expressed in other reviews is its high level of subjectivity to the point of reading like a long drawn out tabloid creating some skepicism surounding the facts. Unlike another reviewer who stated that this book was tough to get through because it was \\"overly simplistic\\" I felt that it was easy to get through for that very reason. It needs to be pointed out that whoever was responsible for editing made some very obvious grammatical errors which should be corrected if this book ever gets reprinted.    Mao: \\"The Unknown Story\\" would make a good supplement for other more objective biographies written about this enigma called Mao but should not be taken literally as an all conclusive definitive.
1416523359|4.0|Well, Stephen King got me in this one. He had me mad as hell concerning some of his characters positions on a few things. When Lisey unloaded the gun as they waited on the king of the Incucks I got so aggravated at this irrational fear of a device designed to save and defend life (or feed it in a hunting role) that I had to put the book down and walk away for a while. I have to congratulate him because this is his genius, being able to gradually suck you in that area of suspended disbelief in your mind where you are actually in the story, relating emotionally to the characters, though I must admit I find myself lately feeling preached at. I have not made up my mind as to whether that is fair or not.    I also find myself wondering to what degree this story opens a window into his mind. I have made no secret about my admiration for the writer and the man and my understanding as to why he holds certain public positions, but I find myself continuing to pony up the money for his fiction and works when others on his side of the political aisle receive no business from me. Why?    Because the man's story's are worth it. The idea of alternate `wheres,' no matter what monsters may ride there is a fantasy, a wish, an idea that gets me through the days and makes my evenings more bearable. As this planet increasingly is covered and oppressed by a layer of regulation, control, and oppression by governments and multinationals, the idea that someone can WISH or BELIEVE themselves into somewhere else...Booya Moon, or the Territories, or a great desert where wizards flee the righteous wrath of Peacemaker packing paladins is of great comfort.    Any night now, perhaps I will go to sleep and wake up in Booya Moon.    Slight preachiness aside, \\"Lisey's Story\\" is a good read and I recommend it highly.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|Radio Nowhere is an awesome song.  Not surprising to see that Bruce Springsteen still has it after all these years.  The rest of the album is rather enjoyable
B000R8YC1I|5.0|Loved this movie growing up. Now having it on dvd I can enjoy it for years to come.
B00132D808|2.0|I think it is Pretty. Odd. they even released this garbage. Their lyrics to me just dont make the slightest bit of sense, the music got dulled down, and they dont sound like they used to at all. I liked their last cd beacuse they were different, now they are trying to be like everyone else. Their single led me to believe that this cd was going to be good and they didnt change too much, but I was way off. Biggest dissapointment since Linkin Parks last album. Bands need to stop trying to get away from their roots and why people like them in the first place.
0061122416|5.0|its a good read .... would not say that its a book that is hard to put down ........
B000BTC5LW|5.0|There's nothing to say about it, it's just GREAT... one of the greatest concerts/productions/art-monument in history!!!!
B00132D808|5.0|I know that it sounds like 60's music and it might be slower than their other album, but my opinion, is that it's AWSOME!! Someone said that they stole the 60's sounds and looks, but they DIDN'T STEAL IT! They got INSPIRED by it. If you don't like that kind of stuff then WHY ARE YOU BUYING IT?!?!?!?! Another thing that I noticed is that the \\"!\\" is gone after Panic and their long titles are gone. If you suddenly don't like them for that DON'T make mean comments about them and their songs. That is just rude and mean! Anyway, all of the songs are great. I noticed that Ryan also sings in this album a LOT! He really deserves it. Overall I would listen to them again and again and never get tired of it. Guys (PATD) if you are reading this, you did an awesome job and keep up the amazing work!
B000ZN802W|3.0|Although compelling and beautifully captured, I found it meandered a bit. The young mans journey from family shelter to wilderness starvation is brave but misguided. I especially like the scenes on the river. However; a tighter edited version bringing it in around two hours would have been better received. The story of a man throwing away his parents values and striking out on his own is not new. The method used to show us that journey was unique. Good acting and great scenery make this worth a rental. We have all stumbled during our years after High School or even after College, but few cast common sense to the wind. McCandles does, so although we sympathize with his convictions, we cannot applaud his lack of logic.<br /><br />In college I too went camping to get away from it all and I even jumped off a seventy-five foot clift into water with rocks everywhere. Do you truly think if I had hit one of those rocks they would think it was a great story to make a movie about? Doubtful but even I was an experienced diver and so although not brilliant, at least I knew what I was doing. Just as I went camping with my father and anyone else with experience before going into the wild on my own. So although the movie has good acting, great camera work, and excellent directing, that doesn't make me like the story. Afterall lots of hippies did this during the 1960s and I don't see books or movies about most of them. I guess because thats old stuff and Sean Penn didn't direct a movie about it. I might have been more inclined to recommend purchasing it if it was shorter and had a positive message. Think about what it says to most teens. Good quality DVD with fair replayability.

B0015KO52S|5.0|If you have read any of the reviews on other sites bashing this album, don't be fooled. Of course it doesn't sound like the 1st Raconteur album..that would be boring....if you have followed Jack White's career you know that he always changes it up with each album, White Stripes, Raconteurs or any other project that he's involved with.  I think the bands songwriting/arranging on this album is supperior to the 1st.  Great effort!!!  I've been a fan of Jack White since seeing him on a whim at a Detroit bar back in the early Stripe days....this album has now become one of my favorites.....buy it!

0803729227|5.0|My 27 month old son and I really enjoy Julia Donaldson's books and this book is among our favorites. It was the first of her books that we read and we liked it so much that we thought to purchase her other books without looking at other reviews and we have not been disappointed. She is a great children's book author and knows how to keep her stories interesting and just the right length for their attention span(I started this book with my son when he was under two and instead of reading the printed text which would be too long for a two year old, I described each page since the illustrations tell the story themselves-I was able to keep his interest by adding a little bit of detail each time we read it.) The illustrations are wonderful and I feel like my son got exposed to the great vastness of this world by simply going on an adventure with the snail and the whale:-)
B0010X73ZG|4.0|I loved the original story, and I'm often surprised when I see so many reviews online attacking the film here.  I felt the film was very close to the original story with a slight occasional change to dialogue and some added events.  Other than that, it was exactly as I'd imagined it and more.    I loved the creature effects, the acting, and pretty much the overall setting.  The only part I was truly disappointed with was the depressing ending.  The ending was greatly different from the short novel, which never really had a specific end and left the rest to the imagination of the readers.  It would have been more enjoyable to me if the end was at least good, or if the director had made it true to the book and left no resolved outcome.
006056251X|5.0|So here is the deal.....Lisa Kleypas is without question my favorite author, and Devil in Winter just became my favorite of her books (previously it was Dreaming of You!) This book is magic.  It is darned near perfect, and I will try to not gush my way through this review.<br /><br />The hero of this book was the villain in It Happened One Autumn.  I despised him and wondered how Lisa would ever be able to change my mind and allow my heart to soften towards him.  She did it.  Sebastian St. Vincent is now my new \\"favorite hero\\" and his reformation is one to behold!<br /><br />Sebastion agrees to marry Evangeline Jenner for financial reasons and in return offers Evie protection against cruel and despicable relatives.  It is not a love match, but one that is mutually beneficial.  Evie agrees to sleep with Sebastion \\"one time\\" to make their marriage legal and then no more.  This works for Sebastion, who's promiscuous ways are legendary.<br /><br />But what happens when a husband \\"falls\\" for his wife.  What happens when a self-proclaimed rake wants more from his wife than her money.  What happens when two seemingly mismatched people find happiness together....the perfect love story happens.<br /><br />I loved everything about this book.  It really is a romance lover's dream book.  It has all the components that make romance so much fun and so addictive.  Evie comes out of her shell to take a chance at love, and Sebastion \\"wakes up\\" to what life is all about.  It is, without question, her best book to date.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|A lot of horror films lately have fell into 2 categories: the so-called \\"gorno\\" type films where the film contains some of the more vile and disgusting imagery this side of Cannibal Holocaust while the other believes by putting in a whole bunch of scenes that make audiences jump and preferably has a creepy kid. The faults are of course gore disgusts, doesn't scare and having a bunch of scenes that make people jump out of their seat doesn't stay with you long enough to get under your skin. \\"The Mist\\", directed by Frank Darabont, at least approaches a horror movie by filling the film with tension and unease; it's just too bad it makes some faults with other things as well.    Artist David Drayden is heading to the store to pick up some supplies after a particularly violent storm and a strange mist coming from the mountains. Just thinking it's routine, it turns even more strange when the mist rolls into town, blanketing everything and one citizen screams of things within it. While some are skeptical, others see proof that they are essentially trapped by the things that lurk on the outside as well as threatened by those that are in the inside, but not monsters necessarily but people.    One of the hardest things to accomplish in a film, especially in the horror genre, is to have characters people watching will care about so that when they go, a feeling of sadness comes. The Mist strives for this in scenes where we get to know some of them but a lot of them are written so one-dimensionally or lacking that it's hard to feel anything for them since there's just not a lot for them to do. Then there's some dumb decisions and illogical choices that it's hard to take what they do and feel something from it. One character I thought worked well, which was Toby Jones as grocery store bagger Ollie while the one that got the most attention (though I didn't care for her) was Mrs. Carmody played by Marcia Gay Hayden who portrays her with such frequent Bible-talk that you feel if anycomeuppance should come to her, it's simply because she's annoying and not what she's saying or represents.    As a horror film, does it succeed? Well it does to a certain extent since there is some scenes of attacks and bug-related goodness and the servicable-but-not-stellar effect work gets you going but the emphasis on the human characters unhinged and without authority restraints doesn't give it as much creepiness but then there's some scenes like a pharmacy visit that work exceedingly well. As far as the ending is concerned, it's one where emotionally it might watch the feel of the film but doesn't really connect for some reason, either the overbearing music or acting but some feel it's the right kind of ending for this film or it's either too depressing and the ending worked or you didn't like it because of what it did.    In many ways the Mist reminds me of a music band that is very musically accomplished but has a terrible singer. You could have things that work well (the direction, tone) but there's always that nagging thing that you can either forgive and keep listening or can't get past that one thing that brings it down.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this CD!  Rarely do I find a CD where I love every track - but this is one!  I'm a big \\"sing along in the car\\" person and this CD provides track after track of great songs to sing along to.  The lyrics are absolutely beautiful, each song tells a geat story.  Several of the tracks remind me a lot of Broadway songs because their stories are so strong.  I have recommended this CD to all my girlfriends and I recommend it to all of you too!
B000NVT0RU|4.0|An intense film that while has often been compared to Saving Private Ryan other than them both being war films has very little in common.<br /><br />The film depicts Algerian soldiers who had volunteered to fight in the French army during world war 2.  The film begins with a village elder in Algeria calling upon the men to fight for the 'motherland' France against German occupation.  When enlisted, they are brought together with North African troops who had already been fighting in North Africa and were to be posted to France.  They are put under the command of an Algerian born French officer, given the most basic of training and then sent to the front.<br /><br />Their first battle is to take a hilltop heavily fortified by German forces.  While suffering heavy casualties they manage to capture the position.  Encouraged by their success and now with valuable military experience they are greeted as heroes in France.  Still prejudice is never far away.  The first most obvious example we are give is when on board a boat the men are receiving a meal however, the chef refuses to give a tomato to a black soldier resulting in a minor mutiny that is only quelled when their commanding officer assures them that all will receive the same rations.<br /><br />The army unit moves to the mountains where they are commanded to hold positions in freezing conditions while white French troops are given leave, finally they are given leave only to return back to be given a mission to hold a small French village under near impossible conditions.<br /><br />Much of the film is given to developing each character.  One is an illiterate man from a village, incapable of making his own decisions and quickly falls under the leadership of his commanding officer.  Another is a fairly well educated man who seeks promotion in the army and sees himself as a career officer.  Then we have two brothers and a man who falls in love with a local girl and hopes that when the war ends, he may return to her and settle down in Marseilles.  Finally, there is their commanding officer, who while born in Algeria sees himself as very much French with something of a colonial contempt for the Arabs while keeping a dark secret hidden.<br /><br />While there is ample time for character development and throughout the film you do come to relate to the characters I found it interesting that the black African soldiers barely said a word (Other than complain about not getting a tomato) and played very much a background role.  No doubt they were Senegalese troops due to their dress and there does exists a fair amount of racism towards black Africans by some Arabs so I would have been interested to see something of that examined in the film.  I felt the simple \\"All us colonials together\\" A little far fetched.<br /><br />That out of the main characters one it seems wishes to remain in France, another begins to feel increasingly that while Fighting for the freedom of France that should also extend to his own people I found quite realistic.  I have spoken to many Africans who had fought during the second word war and many tell of how on returning from the war saw the freedom of their own nation just as important as the freedom of Britain or France for which they fought.<br /><br />The fact that it has took so long to recognise the contribution of 'colonial' troops during the second world war both in the cinema and in history books may go some way to explain why some would see this film as 'politically correct'  The fact that France frozen the pensions of these men who fought to free their country is a source of shame.<br /><br />This is a touching film.  One of the concluding scenes where after the Algerian troops having fought so bravely to defend the village the photographer takes pictures of white troops celebrating with local villages was an excellent way in showing how history has been whitewashed.<br /><br />Well worth watching.inally, there is their commanding officer, who while born in Algeria sees himself as very much French with something of a colonial contempt for the Arabs while keeping a dark secret hidden.

B0013FBS20|4.0|The nicest thing about being the last man on earth would be not having to pay for parking in Times Square. There's nothing wrong with a good movie. \\"I Am Legend\\" may miss the mark as a great movie but what it does do it does extremely well. While Francis Lawrence's \\"I Am Legend\\" (this is the third version of the story told on film based on Richard Matheson's novel of the same name but it inspired countless other films including \\"Night of the Living Dead\\")may be bigger and bolder than \\"The Last Man on Earth\\" and \\"The Omega Man\\" (the two other film versions of the same tale), it is the small moments as well as the action sequences that make this film worthwhile.<br /><br />Will Smith plays Dr. Robert Neville a military researcher brought in to solve a cure for cancer that has gone horribly wrong. The virus designed to deliver the payload kills patients with those remaining alive turned into creatures that seem to have no ability to reason and become monsters. Neville fails at stopping the outbreak from spreading but he remains in New York City still searching for a cure accompanied by his only companion a dog his son gave him. While hunting for the \\"Night Seekers\\" for his experiments, he also must avoid being hunted by them for food.<br /><br />Will Smith gives a terrific, nuanced performance as Neville and is the biggest asset. The visual effects of an abandoned and overgrown Times Square are stunning and captures the sense of isolation that Neville feels. He's not only cut off from the world but he's also cut himself off from many of his own emotions overcome by a sense of failure but still believing \\"I can fix this\\". There are some other fine performances in the film as well but saying any more about them would provide too many spoilers.<br /><br />The main flaws of the film are the Night Seekers and plot holes in the last act of the film. The Night Seekers are effectively used but we see too much of them (they would have been more frightening in shadow)and they don't look real enough (at least to me). The plot holes in the third act I won't reveal (again, they also reveal spoilers)but suffice to say the film is very good inspite of its flaws.<br /><br />The DVD has two versions of the film. The first on disc 1 is the theatrical cut (which I felt was inferior). The second disc has a short documentary on the real threat we face by viruses both natural and man made with experts from Harvard and other leading research facilities chiming in on the beauty of a virus (which is neithr living or dead according to one researched but somewhere inbetween). The second disc has the alternate cut of the film and there's also a weblink to bonus material. The Blu-ray INCLUDES the bonus featurettes which amount of about 50 minutes of material.<br /><br />We also get animated comics that show the effects of the disease across the world.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the theatrical cut and alternate versions are seamlessly branched on the single disc Blu-ray and HD-DVD.<br /><br />While a flawed film, \\"I Am Legend\\" is a very good thrill ride with a strong central performance by Will Smith which sells even the weaker aspects of the story. The 2 disc DVD edition really should have been a single disc edition (with the bonus material) like the Blu-ray.n't look real enough (at least to me).

1596912855|2.0|I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the resemblance between the main concept of the novel \\"Austenland\\" and the 1973 sci-fi classic \\"Westworld.\\" Like the futuristic resort of \\"Westworld,\\" (with its separate parks of Westworld, Medievalworld and Romanworld), Austenland features a park where rich people dress up in costumes and live out their romantic historical fantasies; the main difference being that Austenland features lo-tech actors, instead of robots. Unfortunately, there are no revolts or explosions or races against time, as featured in the movie. But to make up for this, all the characters in this book are pretty robotic.     Now, the concept is great and the story itself is relatively well-written, and I was able to painlessly finish it.  But there's no surprises, no depth, and everything unfolds exactly as you might expect it to; also, there is next to no world building or character development.  Jane, the heroine, is irritating, inobservant and dull.  I know this is only a chick lit novel, but I really wanted to see the inner workings of Austenland- how did this place come to being?  Where exactly was it in England?  Why was it so shrouded in mystery?  However, none of these questions are answered- Jane doesn't even show much curiosity.  After she arrives at the mysteriously located Austenland, funded by her late great-aunt's bequest, she sets out to enjoy this latter-day Regency House Party as superficially as possible. Although there are a few humorous observations, there's mostly just a lot of pretty shallow introspection, regarding her obsession with Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy, and whether she should trust Mr. Nobley, the resident Darcy-esque robot- erm, I mean actor.  To the surprise of no one, they fall in love and they end up flying off into the sunset.  I know I'm supposed to think that that this is True Wuv, but given the sketchy characterization given them by Ms. Hale, there is nothing about these two that makes me believe that this relationship has asnowball's chance in hell.    It's too bad, because I'm pretty sure this author can do better.  There were a few moments, when Jane is missing the modern world and reflecting on the artificiality of her surroundings, where I was actually interested in what was going on.  In the end, though, I wondered what was the point of this ridiculous vacation; Jane's great-aunt should have bought her time with a therapist instead.         All in all, this book is an okay way to kill time, but I felt it left a lot to be desired.
0743289684|4.0|I was a little dubious about this story when I first picked it up ... But as the story went on I could not believe my reactions. I don't think I have cried so much not have I ever felt so many emotions in reading a a book. The mind blowing thing is that this is a TRUE story... not a fairytale. -   I have such admiration and am in such awe of this woman. She has gone through so much and maintained her dignity and determination.   However, I don't feel she can say that ALL MUSLIMS behave in the way she describes. I do understand that there needs to be a Muslim revolution of types in the way they treat women -  but again not all Muslim  are guilty of this.I personally know a couple of muslim families. One family from former Yugoslavia don't even wear the hijab! In Another family (Iranian) - the wife wears the head scarf but is not in anyway abused or down trodden!  These people may be just a drop in the ocean ..... but nevertheless.... READ THIS BOOK. It will make anyone Grateful to live in the U.S or any other wester country.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I will be brief in my review. I will just say I loved this novella and I loved the film. I also likked the ending despite how disturbing it may be to some.<br />also in the commentary towards the end of the movie Frank Darabont says he got the idea for the ending from a paragraph SK wrote in the original novella. I won't go into details but the paragraph is there after they get into the truck. It's just David thinking to himself about what might have to happen. So the director took this idea SK had and saw it all the way through to it's sad conclusion. so I have no problem with the ending of the film. it's a great adaptation in my mind. I never did in the first place but this just makes it stronger.

If you like autobiographies not written in the first person, then this book is not for you.

B000TLMWMY|5.0|Johnny Cash's 58 episodes of prime time television, stretching from late 1969 into early 1971 were broadcast, musical and social landmarks all in one. In a society roiled by the Vietnam War, a generation gap, racism, and numerous other divisions, Cash parlayed his artistry, broad musical vision, experienced opinions, faith and personal integrity into a television series that crisscrossed the American landscape. This two-DVD set excerpts four hours of material from the series, providing a good sense of the show's overall breadth and depth. Both discs intersperse short interview segments (with Kris Kristofferson, John Carter Cash and original show staff) to explain just how radical were many of the show's elements.<br /><br />Cash brought his ease as a stage performer to the improvised studio of Nashville's Ryman Auditorium. He played easily to both the cameras and the live audience, making this a hybrid of a concert being taped and a television show with an audience to generate applause. The shows offer the energy and edginess of live performance with the polish of a studio program. The production, audio, video and staging teams all did superb jobs. The sets vary between large abstract shapes (ala Hullabaloo) and cozy suburban living rooms; the lighting is colorful and flattering to the performers and the sound is captured surprisingly well. Columbia/Legacy's engineers have done a terrific job of remixing from the multi-track master tapes. The video shows a few artifacts in the margins but is generally quite good, and the color is fine.<br /><br />The guest list reached forward to the cutting edge, but also backward with segments highlighting the contributions of acts like Bill Monroe, Homer & Jethro, The Carter Family and Cash's Sun labelmates, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Roy Orbison. The list of contemporary acts from country, folk, soul and rock is astounding. Starting with Bob Dylan on show #1, Cash gathered what he thought to be important and interesting talents to present to both his Nashville audience in the Ryman, and to those tuning in nationwide. He challenged his audience with the controversial and defiantly anti-war Pete Seeger, bringing him on to play banjo and sing \\"Cripple Creek\\" before moving him to the front of the stage to lead a sing-a-long of \\"Worried Man Blues.\\" By the time Cash rejoins him, Seeger has the crowd nervously singing along.<br /><br />Another fascinating guest is Louis Armstrong, featured less than a year before his passing. Cash and Armstrong recreate a 1930's session on which the latter backed the father of country music, Jimmie Rodgers. For those who only remember Armstrong's grin and \\"Hello Dolly,\\" his trumpet playing here will quickly inform you of his seminal role in the history of American music. Merle Haggard provides another tribute to Jimmie Rodgers with a version of \\"No Hard Times,\\" before sitting down with Cash to sing his own \\"Sing Me Back Home.\\" Hank Williams Jr., clean-cut and in a western suit (that is, before the sunglasses and hat), provides a moving tribute to his father.<br /><br />Established country stars George Jones, Marty Robbins and Tammy Wynette show just why they were stars. Jones voice is in stellar form - it's almost hard to believe he's singing live - as he swings through a medley of three classic songs. Robbins was a Ryman favorite, and you can hear the audience hooting and hollering as he sings a medley of his western hits that culminates with an abridged version of \\"El Paso.\\" Wynette's performance gains the most from its video dimension. The close-ups of her face reveal an emotional connection to \\"Stand By Your Man\\" that goes well beyond the vocal.  The stark staging of singers with the accompanying band off-stage will make you long for a time when vocalists were sufficiently fetching performers to hold your attention without dancers and other razzle-dazzle.<br /><br />Cash's selection of mavericks is similarly spot-on. Kris Kristofferson appears young, long-haired, and clear-eyed as he sings \\"Loving Her Was Easy.\\" It's a stark contrast to the grizzled veteran interviewed in the documentary segments. Waylon Jennings, clean shaven and with his hair still slicked back, was well on his way to presenting country music with the fire of a rock band. His bassist sports a flower-power sticker on his Fender axe, Jessi Colter hots things up playing organ, and his cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Brown Eyed Handsome Man\\" shows how fluidly he created music out of multiple genres. Cash offered a surprisingly honest and potent introduction to Neil Young's \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" by discussingg his own drug use on location with college students.<br /><br />Among the happiest-to-be-there guests is Creedence Clearwater's John Fogerty. He seems to be having a religious experience singing \\"Bad Moon Rising\\" at the Ryman, and was probably thinking about Carl Perkins (who was backstage as a member of Cash's troupe) as he picked the break. Another guitarist who had Perkins on his mind was Eric Clapton. After playing a tune with Derek and the Dominos, Clapton and Perkins happily swap licks on the latter's Sun era hit, \\"Matchbox,\\" with Cash strumming and singing along. Cash was perfect at slipping in and out of his guest's sets, sitting with Ray Charles on the piano bench as he growls out an amazing gospel arrangement of \\"I Walk the Line,\\" then slipping away as Charles swings into a slow, soulful version of \\"Ring of Fire.\\"<br /><br />Cash's entourage of Carl Perkins, The Tennessee Three, Mother Maybelle Carter and her daughters (June, Anita and Helen) and the Statler Brothers also got their share of stage time. The Tennessee Three could flatten you with the powerful, locomotive rhythm of \\"Big River,\\" and June Carter Cash is featured singing the terrific original, \\"A Good Man,\\" filled with the questions of day (the war, the environment, the generation gap) and an appeal to faith for solutions. Mother Maybelle can be spied playing her autoharp and picking her beloved Gibson, and of course, Cash's own musical segments find him at one of his performing peaks.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine anyone else with the talent, range and personal gravitas to hold this show together from the center. Hosts like Ed Sullivan could arrange and produce shows, but only Cash could have been the performing ringmaster who worked with the musicians at their own level. It was the context of his personal endorsements that bound these disparate artists into a fluid, entertaining, educational and ultimately impactful whole. Whether or not the entire series is ever remastered and released, these two DVDs are both a solidly entertaining four hours of treasures, and a wonderfully selected overview of the series.

031286504X|5.0|I didn't know this story existed until after the movie a friend of mine told me he had read it and wanted to see how they adapted parts to the movie.  And after reading it, I can attest that it was close to the story.  I can tell what was going through the character's head while he's alone, which is one thing that I like more about books than movies.  All in all, the movie was very close to the original story.  The book also come with a number of other stories, too.
B000ZIZ1A6|5.0|This single-disc CD provides sixteen highlights of the musical performances that fill the like-titled two-DVD video anthology of Cash's 1969-71 television variety program. The DVDs themselves can only sample the riches of Cash's 58 episodes, but both collections give you a strong dose of Cash's eclectic tastes, the artistic will that brought Mother Maybelle Carter and Eric Clapton to the same national network stage (though, sadly, not playing together), and the personal depth that fueled both his own work and his ego-free sharing of the spotlight.<br /><br />Cash was both the star and emcee of his show, and he excelled in both roles. His introductions to his own songs and to guest acts are both professional and heartfelt. His personal renown introduced some of country's greatest acts to those beyond Nashville's reach, and his taste for non-country innovators informed middle-American audiences who might not otherwise have listened. Cash's own performances are backed by his regular performing troupe, including The Carter Family (Mother Maybelle and her daughetrs June, Anita and Helen), The Statler Brothers, Carl Perkins and the Tennessee Three. They accomplishment as a well-oiled road unit is evident throughout.<br /><br />The guest performances are both excellent and fascinating. George Jones swings through a medley of hits with an ease that's truly astounding, and Lynn Anderson ably keeps up with the mile-a-minute lyric of \\"I've Been Everywhere.\\" Ray Charles' slow, soulful arrangement of \\"Ring of Fire\\" is astounding, and Waylon Jennings, fresh off a Grammy® win for his cover of \\"Macarthur Park,\\" reprises his rock 'n' roll roots with a cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Brown Eyed Handsome Man.\\" Tammy Wynette, Bobby Bare and James Taylor each give performances of hits that recount the original records, showing how well those hits were already arranged for live performance.<br /><br />Taped in front of a live audience at Nashville's then-home of the Grand Ole Opry, the Ryman Auditorium, the show featured the requisite country stars, but also attracted a wide array of non-Nashville acts, from the mainstream and from the worlds of outlaw country, rock and soul. Several of the shows most legendary (and outr&eacute;) guest are missing from the CD, including Cash's first featured artist, Bob Dylan. The DVDs include several of these landmark performances, including Dylan's solo shot and his duet with Cash on \\"Girl from the North Country.\\" Oddly, Cash's duet with Joni Mitchell on the same Dylan tune is included here, but not on the DVDs.<br /><br />The sound is generally very good, if perhaps a bit pinched towards mono. Columbia's engineers have done hero's work in rescuing these treasures from the haphazardly produced multi-track originals. The sound is surprisingly intimate for live performances made on a television stage, particularly in an era before there was any notion of the audio's archival value. The occasional flub or cough marks these tracks as cameras-rolling first takes, and the heart and soul poured into each performance makes them an essential part of the Cash legacy.

0517543052|5.0|Old book, classic message: if you've got one foot in the future and the other in the past, then you'll be peeing on today. Be here now! Accept the fun, be one with yourself.
B00133KFGW|3.0|This movie is an okay movie.  I think the music is beautiful, but the premise of the story is similiar to \\"Oliver Twist\\" in a lot of ways.  Freddie Highmore gives a masterful performance with a child-like innocence, but with a deep sense of maturity.  I was not huge on Jonathan Rhys Meyers or Kerri Russel's performances as they seemed weak compared to Highmore's.  Aside from that, the movie is long and there were definately parts that the movie could have gone without.  It's a very artistic movie and I was a little disappointed by this movie as I had rented it with very high expectations.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I was watching MTV late one night and the video for \\"Falling slowly\\" came on. Keep in mind I never heard the artists before nor did I see the movie.  I was so blown away I literally walked to my computer and bought the cd with that track. I am a musician and record producer. After I got the cd in the mail it stayed in my player for days and I rented the movie which just made me love the cd more. Its an excellent independent film with excellent music, beautiful vocals, and tons of passion. This album puts other singer songwriter albums to shame. Well well worth the money.
B00132D808|5.0|I didn't like this when I listened to it the first time.  Then again, I didn't like \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" the first time either.  Now I love it and the album.  Obviously, people will come in expecting to hear stuff very similar to \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.\\"  This album is NOT their old album.  It's very different but superb.
0307394549|5.0|I don't do a lot of baking, but this cookbook is awesome! The book is all color and has great pics of the cookies. Sometimes it's hard to know if you'll like a cookie by the recipe, but the detailed pictures allow you to see what the finished cookie will look like. I think it's more fun looking at the pics than the actual baking process. Sure makes me hungry. :) I would definately recommend this product!!!
0452289963|5.0|The book, \\"A New Earth\\" is an excellent read.  This companion book along with the Oprah broadcast on Monday nights has been amazing.   I am now entering the fourth episode with Tolle and Oprah and can't wait to continue.    I knew exactly what I was purchasing and was delighted that it was available on line with Amazon, thanks.    Jill
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I truly love watching this movie.  I can't help but feel like I'm right there with them throughout the story.  I never get tired of watching it.
B00005MP58|5.0|I've seen various versions of Pride and Prejudice and this one is my favorite. Mr, Darcy just oozes with pride, arrogance, and hoity toitiness and Eliza... she like an earlier version of Scarlett O'Hara:fiesty and opinionated.  And like Rhett, Mr Darcy has meet his match. I watch this movie continually, especially if there's nothing else on.
1416914293|5.0|Cassandra's writing is phenomenal! I love all the twists and turns. She always keeps you wanting to read more. I stayed up all night cause I couldn't put it down. I can't WAIT to see how everything ends up in City of Glass (though I have a pretty good idea) and I'm so excited. I really hope I'm right. I only wish I didn't have to wait a whole year....it's almost as bad as waiting for Breaking Dawn! This series is a must read!!! :-)     Once again I was so frustrated at the end though just like in City of Bones...lets hope she doesn't do that to us with the last installment!
B000MV8ABS|1.0|I saw this movie when I was 15 or 16 in 1979 and it scared me to pieces. It scared me so bad that I made the guy who took me to this movie stay on the phone with me all night after he dropped me off at home. I woke to the sound of his snoring on the other end. I couldn't look at, let alone buy, a full length mirror for years. But seeing it again in 2008...wow, what a bad film! Maybe I've gotten jaded by today's horror films because  the effects in this one are horrible.It's good for the nostalgia and camp: a movie to watch with your friends, drink a few beers, while each and every one of you proclaim that even you can act better than the actors in this movie.
B000W4KT64|5.0|Rented this movie for the wife she loved so I got it for her great movie.
B00005JPTK|4.0|This movie is sad. Very sad. And isolating. That's what you feel almost throughout. Every time Will kept trying to convince himself he'd be alright walking through the halls of an empty store, pretending to pay for things while he was ultimately alone (minus his dog), I initially thought it was strange. Then, that strangeness turned out to be very, very testing later on.<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't excited to see this movie. I didn't really hear  much about it specifically which was great. But my brother rented it so when we finally got it, I saw the back. There were \\"zombies\\" there and I wasn't really up for it. Not scared just totally not interested.<br /><br />And then I watched. It was alright. In the beginning. But as it progressed and I digested what was going on I was amazed, captivated and totally down and out for him and his situation.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't see how anyone could turn there head and say this movie \\"was alright\\" or \\"it sucked\\". But then I think and know that people have their own opinions...<br /><br />For those who have yet to see it, see it. It's fabulous. I know I didn't really say much about the movie but it's interesting. The storyline is good and the characters decent. But it's mostly Will. That's what you see: Will. Every day. But once it sinks in I'm sure you'll like it too.<br /><br />4.2 stars.<br /><br />end note: Will's still as attractive but he totally got too skinny. I think that was expected for the role. But for guys like me and females he's totally cut. He needs to stay in shape for what's to come...
B0010YSD7M|5.0|The PERFECT ending to the SG-1 Series.  Makes me wish it was still on the air.
B00005S6K8|5.0|There is just something about this version of Sabrina. All of the performances given in this film were wonderful. I love the window this film gives you into the 90's, it is oh so rich. Oh and Harrison Ford! Oh dear! Love him in this film. I say it is worth a watch.
B00000J2PH|5.0|After all these years, this album remains one of the classics to be listenned to on a regular basis. Rarely has songwriting consistently been expressed so well on a single album. So many of the melodies have been become classics through the works of other artists, that Ms. King should be held in esteem by all those who listen and enjoy the work. Regardless of how many listens one gives this album, it is still removed from the shelf and followed again whenever ones wishes to smile and dream of other moments.
B00000JLWW|5.0|[...]  I watched this movie and really enjoyed it. It was quite a long movie, but you don't realize it while you're watching it because the storyline is so compelling. The acting was superb, I like Leonardo DiCaprio and wasn't familiar with Kate Winslet until the debut of this movie. The wonderful special effects make it seem so realistic. Computer animation was well done. The movie was meant to tell a love story despite the tragedy itself. I was, as most women who watched the movie, emotionally touched and moved when the story came to a close. It was a heart-warming and heart-wrenching all at the same time.
B0011QC9U6|4.0|I first saw this movie in an IMAX theatre presented in digital and 3D.  I was amazed of the quality of CG work.  Angelina Jolie's CG is one of the spectacular I've ever seen.  If you like Final Fantasy The Spirits Within and The Polar Express, this will blow you away.  The reason why I didn't gave this a full five star is that I wish that they put out an alternate 3D version on the same disc.
B0010358EE|5.0|definitely worth having in the collection. i'm not even an anime or big comic movie fan, but this was unique. i rewound so many scenes because they looked so cool. i rented this from netflix on SD format, but can't wait to get the HD-DVD format!
0783235453|4.0|dvd came in very short time, in great condition, and played extremely well, with no skips, interruptions.
0684857219|5.0|The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding : The Bible of Bodybuilding, Fully Updated and Revised, simply put, is a great book for the average weight-lifter to the serious competitive body-builder.  I wish I had bought this book when I first started lifting weights!  This book describes and shows you with pictures the correct form to all sorts of diffrent weight-lifting exercises for all body parts.  You'll learn a lot from this book, regardless of how interested your into actual body-building.  The best book of its kind, in my opinion, and I suggest it to everybody that is serious about lifting weights and getting muscles.  My only complaint is that the book needs to be updated a little bit.
B000000HRP|5.0|I have been listening to the English jazz rock group Brand X for a long time now and this was the album I started with.  This 1976 debut by the group is fantastic and presents a neat twist on the jazz rock theme.  That is, while the band is largely indebted to the breakneck tempos and thunderous volume of groups like the Mahavishnu Orchestra circa 1971-1973, I can also hear traces of the English Canterbury bands and experimental composers like Brian Eno (most likely stemming from the involvement of Phil Collins and Percy Jones on Brian's Another Green World album from 1975).<br /><br />The lineup on Unorthodox Behaviour includes Phil Collins (drums and percussion), Robin Lumley (keyboards, synthesizers), John Goodsall (electric and acoustic guitars) and Percy Jones (fretless electric bass).<br /><br />Like many of the jazz rock musicians these guys were world class musicians and possess dazzling technical skill.  Of course as a huge Genesis fan I was especially pleased by the presence of Phil and he demonstrates throughout why he \\"was\\" considered to be among the finest drummers in rock.  As a bassist myself, I have always liked Percy Jones - he has a very distinctive style that at times, seems like he is completely out of control.  I am also happy that he does not use the fretless bass in a traditional sense, i.e., glissandos and instead plays the instrument as if it were fretted.  John Goodsall is a criminally underappreciated guitarist and his approach is largely indebted to the style of virtuoso John McLaughlin (from Mahavishnu Orchestra).<br /><br />Musically, this album presents a heady blend of wild, full-throttle jazz rock, some quieter experimentation highly reminiscent of the music off of Another Green World, and aspects of the Canterbury style.  There are nice dynamic contrasts (including nice acoustic sections) and the compositions are very interesting - in this respect, I wish that the keyboardist had more of a presence.  Although not something I normally discuss when reviewing an album, there were moments when I actually found myself tapping my foot - particularly on the more \\"swinging\\" pieces.  Phil was instrumental in this respect and as he was so fond of saying, really \\"got behind\\" these pieces and simply grooved.  The album closes on an interesting note with the quiet, earthy textures of Touch Wood.<br /><br />This reissue features pretty skimpy liner notes and while the overall sound quality is excellent, there was some slight distortion on the drums, particularly when Phil is smashing away on a \\"China-boy\\" type cymbal.  Indeed, when Phil really gets cooking on the lower kit (bass drum/floor toms etc) I can also hear some slight distortion.  Apart from my nitpicking however, this really is a well-recorded album.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent example of jazz rock fusion that is different from the standard jazz rock affair and is very highly recommended.  Another cool (and recommended) album is Another Green World by Brian Eno.  Although very different than the music on Unorthodox Behaviour, the album features great interplay between Phil and Percy on a few tunes.ng an album, there were moments when I actually found myself tapping my foot - particularly on the more \\"swinging\\" pieces.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I highly recommend this movie. I rented it on the advice of one of my daughter's friends. It slowly builds momentum (unusual for a comedy) and for the last half hour it is one laugh after another. I was wiping my eyes by the end.<br /><br />The movie is a farce, slapstick,  wacky and eccentric to the extreme....but a good extreme. Terribly un-PC, nevertheless it is a wonderfully amusing movie about a subject that is rarely satirized.
0385512058|3.0|Want to know what Keith sees when he looks in the mirror?  Read this book, you'll know all you care to know.  Looking for hints on how to achieve \\"balance\\" between family, friends, work and recreation while keeping then distinguishable as separate activities? - then don't even think about replicating every aspect of this book - Keith doesn't believe in balance, but, rather, a blurred distinction between genres of human relationships.<br /><br />The recipe for networking, as laid out in this book, is probably not a good fit for many people, but there are individual elements that are of incredible value to almost everyone.  Ever wonder how to best make use of your time at those endless technical confernces and tradeshows?  This book has great recipes!  The sections on developing and expanding social and professional relationships is invaluable.<br /><br />While most of us are likely not as ambitious as Mr. Ferrazi, or anywhere near as self promoting, today's business trend towards less human contact and personal realtionships give cause for all of us to read and ponder the underlying message of this book.<br /><br />This book is a good companion to [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]], [[ASIN:055380491X Emotional Intelligence: 10th Anniversary Edition; Why It Can Matter More Than IQ]]  and [[ASIN:055338449X Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships]].
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I got this last week and thought it was so good. Loved it. How do I manage to miss movies like this???...never heard of it til I read about it online on a movie forum.<br /><br />The title certainly would have led me to think that perhaps it was porn....which is FAR from what it was. It was a sweet, thoughtful movie which I really enjoyed. Good acting, good storyline, just a feel-good movie of which I wish there were lots more!
B000MCH5TK|4.0|Wow, so many people, so many lives across the world linked to one random incident. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it on Blu-ray but will be \\"almost\\" equally good on other formats.
B000R8YC1S|5.0|Growing up I watched my mom gave me movies that I watched over and over.  Movies like \\"The Princess Bride\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", \\"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\", and of course \\"Labirynth\\".  Unfortunately, Labirynth was one of those movies that I did not watch at all between the ages of six and twenty.  As a child, the film scared me, and I remembered it being a lot scarier than it actually is, and was hesitant but curious to watch it as an adult because of that.<br /><br />  The interesting thing about Labyrinth is that it not just a children's film.  It has elements of a children's films, but it is so much more than that.<br /><br />  The story revolves around Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), a sixteen year old girl who is tired of watching her baby brother on the weekends and spends her free time acting out plays.  So, one night after an argument with her stepmother, she runs into her room only to find her favorite teddy bear missing, blames it on her brother and wishes he were gone.  Only this time, by chance, she gives the command to let the goblins take her brother away only to regret it immediately.  After that it becomes a story of friendship, the power of imagination, faith, and the differences between a girl and woman.<br /><br />  The puppets and the premise make it sound like a mere children's fairy tale, and although it is entertaining for children, it has proven itself worthy for the collection of adults as well.  The characters are fun and while our heroine is whiny and obnoxious at first, she quickly realizes that life isn't fair, and that's the way it is, so get over it!  She struggles to save her brother so he wont be a goblin forever, at the same time struggling with whether or not she'd like to become the goblin queen.  You would think that someone as thin and British as David Bowie wouldn't be so attractive in this role, but he is.  I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role.  He is very campy, but there is a delicate balance between an unreasonable villain and a man trying to win a woman's heart in the best way he knows; power.<br /><br />  The music written by Bowie is first rate and truly elevates the movie to a level it wouldn't have reached otherwise.  Especially, \\"As the World Falls Down\\", which is one of the best sequences in the film.  Overall, if you love fairy tales that are a little more grown up, you will love Labirynth (as long as you don't hate David Bowie).<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amynable villain and a man trying to win a woman's heart in the best way he knows; power.<br /><br />  The music written by Bowie is first rate and truly elevates the movie to a level it wouldn't have reached otherwise.

B000N3ST9I|1.0|For the past year, I've been calling Machine Head's \\"The Blackening\\" the most overrated album of 2007 without hearing the whole thing. Today, I listened to the whole album and I was right. Lost my appetite. All because of listening to this abomination. People have been raving about Machine Head's latest record, \\"The Blackening.\\" Some have been comparing it to Metallica's early material. Some have even gone so far to say it's the greatest metal album ever. But I want to say this. I would rather eat a KFC bucket of my own crap than to listen to The Blackening again. Machine Head are trying to be progressive metal but they failed. They also try to sound like old school thrash metal at times, and it only ends up sounding like Trivium. I want to know why people are acting like The Blackening is the greatest album of all time. It's nothing new. You might as well be listening to Shadows Fall or Bullet for My Valentine or some other emo-metalcore crap. Machine Head were always a trendy band. Hopped on every bandwagon. Look at the facts. When \\"Burn My Eyes\\" and \\"The More Things to Change\\" came out. Groove Metal was big. They followed the trend. Everybody wanted to sound exactly like Pantera and those two albums sounded boring and uninspired. Then came Nu-Metal. Robb Flynn became Flava Flynn. Machine Head recorded \\"The Burning Red\\" and \\"Supercharger\\" of which are some of the worst records of all time. Even some of Machine Head's hardcore fans thought those albums sucked. Soon, Metalcore became big with the rise of crappy bands like Lamb of God and Killswitch Engage. Machine Head followed this trend and released \\"Through the Ashes of Empires\\" and now \\"The Blackening.\\" Like the album before it, The Blackening is a metalcore album. Now with more retro-thrash leanings. It features alot of the things that makes the current \\"metal scene\\" suck so badly. Clean emo vocals, generic and overdone groove riffs, Cliche and idiotic lyrics, Modernized sound, Pointless breakdowns, poor song structure, etc. Not to mention it's sad excuses for thrash metal riffs. Some of these songs are 9 minutes long but they are poorly done.<br /><br />Robb Flynn's vocals sound like his normal wanna-be \\"tough guy\\" voice with a wussy Killswitch Engage-esque whinny emo voice. In one of the softer moments of \\"Halo,\\" he sounds extremely whiney like he's about to cry. This album is filled with musical cliches. I don't even know where to start. Sure, Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel can play guitar but does that really matter? They aren't doing anything that special. The riffs are recycled from countless other bands. Tons of boring groove riffs and lame post-\\"thrash\\" riffs. The lead guitar playing is nothing special either. It just sounds forced and dishonest. People say Machine Head aren't nu-metal anymore I hear tons of nu-metal moments in pretty much every song. I mentioned before that the lyrics are crap. Alot of them have to do with \\"teen angst.\\" It sounds pathetic coming from a 20 year old loser but it's much worse from a 40 year old man.<br /><br />Overall, listening to The Blackening all the way through was self-torture. I literally feel sick to my stomach and wish to have the last hour of my life back. The Blackening is probably the most overrated album of all time. Don't believe what you are told. This is not a masterpiece or a modern day classic. This is just a pathetic attempt at prog. metal, thrash, and metal as a whole. There is nothing unique about copying something bad that has been done before and playing it for 10 minutes. This is just boring and pathetic.tructure, etc. Not to mention it's sad excuses for thrash metal riffs. Some of these songs are 9 minutes long but they are poorly done.

0452289963|5.0|I found this book so inspiring and I felt so moved by it spiritually and personally.  Each chapter allowed me to look deeper within myself as a person which helped me in ways of realizing how I usually would react and how I would handle certain situations in my life.  I would read this book over again.  Thank you Eckhart Tolle for allowing us to look within ourselves through your wisdom.
1402210086|5.0|I first discovered Georgette Heyer when I was a teenager.  I read her book Friday's Child and was completely hooked.  Cotillion is one of my favorites.  The interweaving of the romances of four different couples is delightful.  By the end of the book, you feel as if you have spent time with friends.<br /><br />I cannot recommend Heyer's books too highly.  She, in my opinion, created the Regency romance genre (Ms. Austen's books were the contemporary novels of her period.)  Heyer created a fictional, glittery, aristocratic world which which is still being utilized by historical romance and regency novelists today.  It is interesting to note that she is being republished under historical romances - a genre that relies heavily on sexual escapades.  Heyer's books are romantic but not sexual.  She is able to build a tension which culminates with a kiss rather than a bed romp.<br /><br />These are books you can enjoy and still pass to your younger daughters, sisters, etc. without worrying that the subject matter is too mature.<br /><br />I can only wish that Ms. Heyer wrote twice the number of books she did.  I own each in hardcover and am purchasing my set of \\"reader\\" copies as Sourcebooks republishes her works.
B0000062Y2|3.0|I think that the performances in this film are vastly superior to any other recording of JCS.  Okay, the original album is pretty amazing, but I think that there's a certain passion and immediacy to the film's performance that is missing in some portions of the original album (for example, Pilate).  Ted Neely is really tremendous (screechy, yes, but I like it), and Carl Anderson really embodies Judas with great presence.  I also prefer the mostly American cast of the movie, as opposed to the British original cast.  But that's just me.<br /><br />It's been said by many reviewers, but I must reiterate: the sound quality of this CD is pretty bad.  It's inconsistent in volume, is overall very tinny, and has issues with balancing the vocals with the instruments.  Why there hasn't been a decent remaster is beyond me.  Another irritating thing about this CD is that there is a multi-second pause between every track, really ruining the momentum, especially between tracks like \\"Trial Before Pilate\\" and \\"Superstar.\\"<br /><br />I wish that the instrumentation and clear audio production of the original album could be mixed with the performances from the film.  That would really be the best.  But as it is, I recommend that you buy this album only if you're prepared to listen past the poor audio and focus on the brilliant performances.  Buy it with the original cast album to get the full JCS experience.
1400064287|5.0|Well-written, accessible, and most importantly - applicable. I originally read a library copy, and was so impressed with it that a couple of months later I purchased my own copy, essentially as a reference. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in designing effective messages.
B0002DRDBE|3.0|Clerks has to be one of the best starts from a director who has never made a bad movie. Sure Clerks is in black and white but it's hialrous. Look for the first apperance by Jay and Silent Bob in this classic humourous flick. The DVD gets extra points for adding the animated funeral scene.
0930289528|4.0|comic book style.  good supplement to the movie for those who really got the message.
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|Casino has to be one of the most underrated films that Martin Scorsese directed in the nineties. The acting by the leads is good and the script is excellent. Robert Deniro gave an Oscar worthy performance and Joe Pesci is chilling yet funny again. Even Sharon Stone is good in this brilliant film.
B0011NVCO8|4.0|I love this movie and the HD DVD/Standard DVD is a great bargain at Amazon.  Once again, Denzel Washington turns in a great perfomance.  The film also provides interesting insight into the drug trade during the Vietnam War era.  If I had to change anything in the film, it would have been to have less Russell Crowe.  His character was not all that interesting, but that could just be because he is not a personal favorite of mine.  What did work with the Crowe character was the contrast between him and the Denzel Washington character.  It really raised the question of who was ultimately the better man.
B00005V9IJ|3.0|There some good things in Cast Away take Tom Hank's performance for example but that it's it. The rest of the cast isn't in the film long enough for one to get a vibe of how they would have acted. For over an hour there's no dialouge jsut Hanks standing around. If you're a Hanks fanatic then this is the movie for you, otherwise stay away.
0143038419|5.0|I have not picked up a \\"grown up\\" book in over 5 years, since the birth of my first child. I had heard abnout this book through my mom's group and everyone raved about it. I had a blast reading this book. I felt like I was traveling with her and it definately made me think of all the things I would love to do with my life. I was sad when the story ended and wonder if I will find another book that left me feeling that good at the end. So it you do read it - enjoy it! The story is a good one of a womans journey towards self accepatance and love. And the food part? Makes me want to travel to Italy minus the 20 something pounds she gained!
0783232039|4.0|Bride of Chucky is a proper return to the oringial Chucky we all know and love. Don Mancini script is sharp and funny and the direction by Ronny Yu is equal to his Jap films. The film is a vast imporvement of Childs Play 3, however I wish Chucky would have finally gotten to kill Andy.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Unfortunately the details are absent on this album.  The Devil has left the Reznor.  The electronic beats/drums and synthesized/industrial sounds that made the music cold and mechanical in Pretty Hate Machine, Downward Spiral, and Broken, have been replaced with real drum and base lines and a more live sound.  All the lush textures, atmospheres, and twisting soundscapes of The Fragile, which turned NIN into art, have been stripped away.  Whereas in The Fragile, we were made to feel as if we were falling from grace, in this album we can only grind our teeth as we recall the moment.  If Ghosts and With Teeth had been woven together, we would have had a sequel to rival The Fragile.  Instead, we are left with albums that desperately lack the components that made Nine Inch Nails great.  All that's left here is aggressive rock with a catchy tune.  That isn't to say With Teeth is bad.  If you only listened to Nine Inch Nails before because it had a good beat and a lot of angst, you'll find that here also in agreeable and digestible doses--but nothing more.    So I will whisper soft and hang my head  For what I loved and dreamed for now is dead  May we meet again another day  But until that point With Teeth I'll play
B00005JLYW|4.0|Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle was the crowd pleasing, mindless summer fun we go to the movies for in the summer time. These movies aren't meant to win awards or be realsitic, they are more about having fun and boy did Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle entertain me for two hours. The angels Diaz, Barrymore and Liu all come back to their roles eager and welcome and all three are just as much fun to watch as they were in thr first one. The chemistry between the three is some of the strongest I've ever seen for a trio of women since The Heroic Trio in an action film involing women. Bernie Mac as Bosley steals every scene he's in and it looks like he had tons of fun working on the movie also. I hope they bring him back for the thrid movie. McG is a good action director and sure sometimes the action sequences are unbeliveable but to me it was all part of the fun. Demi Moore was good in her villian role even though she ahd limtied screen time and the always good Crispin Glover is down right creepy as The Thin Man. With plenty of pop culture refences, eye candy and one liners if you want some mindless summer entertainment in the comfort of your own home then this is the movie for you
B0013FDM7E|2.0|\\"I am Legend\\" Directed by Francis Lawrence<br /><br />In the near future a supposed cure for cancer is created and distributed. It turns out that the cure actually becomes a biochemical disease and wipes people out at an alarming rate and those who aren't killed are turned into zombies. Robert Neville (Will Smith) believes he is the last survivor and spends his days in New York City attempting to find a cure for the disease and his nights avoiding the zombies.<br /><br />I was actually expecting a lot more out of this movie. I had read rave reviews and heard first hand accounts from friends about this films greatness. What I witnessed was an average post apocalyptic type story with in my opinion sub par special effects.<br /><br />The Good:  Will Smith's acting was enjoyable. The idea of the movie was good.<br /><br />The Bad: Probably my biggest gripe with this move is the special effects. They were generally unconvincing throughout. I think that much more of the special effects should have been done practically instead of all of the CG. The zombies would have been better as practical instead of CG. The lions in the beginning, the grass growing up through the street and all of the little touches were obvious CG and the quality was so poor that the items that are animated became glaring. The zombies were very reminiscent of the creatures in \\"[[ASIN:B00000JQB5 The Mummy (Widescreen Collector's Edition)]]\\". That was fine almost 9 years ago but hasn't CG gotten better since then? You wouldn't guess that by watching \\"I am Legend\\".<br /><br />Some of the plot turns seem a little bit forced. This isn't a spoiler but Will is constantly trying to shoot deer in this movie by chasing them down with his car. Why didn't he just use some of the corn he was growing as a bait pile and wait for them to come to him? Why chase them in a car or with your dog when you can get them to come to you?<br /><br />Overall: This was OK but is very over hyped in my opinion. Don't avoid watching this but don't make a huge effort to see it either.ther.
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil is by no means a perfect film but when it comes to eye candy films I take them for what they are which is eye candy. Ben Affleck plays Matt/DD very well he actually surpised me with his performance. The film has a dark tone and isn't all colorful like Spider Man was. Colin Farrel and Micheal Clarke Duncan as the villians do good jobs but Colin steals the show as Bullseye. In my opinion Farrel did one of best comic book villain jobs since Jack as The Joker. When it comes to Jenifer Garner as Elerkta she did a good job she's sexy as always. My only complaint with the film was I feel it needed more action but I'm guessing since this wasn't a hit then we won't get sequel with loads of action. It's a fun film just don't take it seriously.
0452289963|5.0|My copy of \\"A New Earth\\" was in perfect condition and shipped quickly. It's a life altering book I highly recommend it to everyone.
B000X97Z60|5.0|I have been listening to Kamelot for only a little while, and I am extremely impressed by the band altogether.  This is without a doubt one of their best albums.  It has all the elements of a epic power metal band.  Best songs (in my opinion)  -March of Mephisto  -The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)  Definitely an album worth buying.
140120306X|5.0|This is an amazing book in many ways. Alan Moore's most experimental comic in some time. The media changes in the book (paper differences, style differences, 3D glasses) are all done with purpose. If you ever wanted twenty League stories all at once this is the book for you. The imagined history is comprehensive and fascinating.. but mostly prose. If you can't stand the idea of the book being half prose then stay away... if however you are cool with that then hop on in... it's great! This book does things you've never seen before in a book, it is an absolute virtuosic performance on every level. He copies (with purpose) the styles and worlds of everyone from P.G. Woodhouse, to Shakespere to Lovecraft.... this book is all over the map.     Moore may have been getting weird lately but his writing his still top notch in the comic medium... Good job Mr. Moore.. now give us book 3 please, with whatever publisher you like.
B000051NT1|1.0|Even though this was recorded in 1967 the sound mix was terrible.  I have heard other live recordings from this era that are a lot better.  The cd is too short and from I hear is that the whole concert was not included on this cd--what a rip!!!  The vocals are not clear at times and the guitar solos are toned down as well as Rays keyboard parts.  No linear notes are included either.  Collectors stay away from this mono muffled recording--I wish I did.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I'll say it right up front,  If you don't like this album, you just don't like good music.  This isn't the crap you hear on the radio, this is great rock music and great songwriting, written by some of the most talented musicians around.  I absolutely loved Broken Boy Soldiers and this just blows that record out of the water.  The songs are much bigger with much more bite.  Instead of psychedelic rock like B.B.S, this is much more like Southern Rock, but with a few songs that are basically country songs.  Easily one of the best records of the year.  Not really a weak spot on the whole album.  Best songs are 'Consoler of the Lonely', 'Top Yourself' and 'Carolina Drama' will knock your socks off.
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Ascent of Man is a fantastic series that addresses many of humanity's most complex and profound questions.  Dr. Bronowski's non-scripted narrative is brilliant in its own regard.  A perfect selection for anyone who is interested in science, history, archaeology, or the human experience.
6305511055|4.0|I first saw this movie back in college.  Thought it was entertaining but  no real social relevence.  I was wrong.  This movie speaks of the Now.  Would the U.S. actually invade another country to aquire Oil?  Would we use another excuse like WMD, Terrorists, Liberating a middle eastern country?  Send 4000 members and counting to thier death becaus of Oil    I think the answer is YES
B0010X73ZG|1.0|This is one of my favorite Stephen King stories and I was excited that it finally came to the screen. I must address the ending because that's what you leave the theatre with. It's not King's ending and there's nothing wrong with that. However, the ending was gratuitously mean and dark and totally out of character with the rest of the movie. It's a Saturday matinee monster popcorn movie (it aint gonna be mentioned alongside The Godfather) with a little religious fervor thrown in. It's NOT the kind of the movie that ends with a father putting a bullet in his son's head and then minutes later having the cavalry show up. The ending was cruel, mean-spirited and unearned and that's why it was a complete flop at the box office. People left with a bad taste in their mouth (I saw it opening night and the ENTIRE audience booed) and people told their friends to avoid it. What a waste.
0064430227|5.0|I just got my son his first library card (remember them?) at the age of two and this was the first book we took out.  I had heard of it, but didn't have it as a child and wanted to have a read through before I considered purchasing it.  I LOVE this book and so does my son.  The very thing that reviewers complain about:  the limited illustrations, is what makes this book so great.  In a time where our kids are constantly overstimulated visually (ie. TV, computers, video games, etc.) it is so nice to have books that are simple, clever and inspire imagination.    As a working artist, I can appreciate the simple genius of this book, not only in it's illustrations, but also in it's encouragement to use our imaginations, or what's left of them.
B000T97SY8|4.0|This new release constitutes Primal Fear's best work to-date.  Hailing from Germany, Primal Fear has released several prior albums, all of which were competent, but somewhat lacking in originality: the band's sound was very reminiscent of Judas Priest.  On this CD, however, they have evolved a more distinctive style.  The music is still in the same genre: intense, powerful metal, reminiscent of the 1980s.  What sets this CD apart from their earlier efforts is that both the melodic ideas and instrumental passages are significantly better than on their previous albums.  The songs often feature unusual chord progressions and key changes.  Keyboards, orchestrations and guest female vocals also enhance the quality of this release.  In essence, this is heavy metal, but with some classical and progressive touches.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|We had seen some episodes of this series when it was first released and had hoped ever since to see the whole thing.  We have found it fascinating, if overwhelming at times.  It is much more complete than the recent Ken Burns history of the Second World War and is a good complement to that series since The World at War is told from the British point of view (though a good deal of American, German, Russian, Japanese, etc. perspective is included as well).  The look is a bit dated but the producers had access to many of the participants who have since died (like Albert Speer), and their perspective is invaluable.  We would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in the Second World War and how our world today continues to deal with what happened then.
0452289963|5.0|Buy this book.  Don't think about not buying this book.  It has changed my life, and I believe it could change yours as well.  It's easy to understand and pretty much answers every question you could want to know.  I bought a copy for everyone in my life.
B0015T7Q98|2.0|I love panic's old stuff and if u liked them before than u wont like them now. i wanted this cd so bad but i listened to it and lost all faith in panic at the disco and after this cd they lost one good fan at least. unless they come out with a cd with there old style on it they'll lose alot of fans!!!
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I picked this one up yesterday and was amazed at the movie.  I don't want to ruin anything for anyone, but throughout the movie, it just got better and better.  They made it as real as possible with the religion and primitive instinct of those given hope.  But, the highlight of the movie was the ending.  My jaw dropped.  I saw this 12 hours ago and I'm still thinking about it.  Also, Stephen King adaptations and Thomas Jane are winners (Dreamcatcher and this).  Get this movie now!
0061122416|5.0|It's a book about following one's dreams and not giving up. And more importantly, it teaches us that the journey towards acheiving one's goal is far more enlightening than the moment of euphoria at acheiving it. This book is a really light read, yet powerful!
B000EWBKKI|4.0|This movie looks so much better in Blu-Ray! Sounds and looks great with my Panasonic DMP-30 Blu-Ray Disc player.<br />You can't beat Amazons prices for Blu-Ray discs.
B00001ODGR|5.0|I've been a Styx fan for probably over a decade, which compared to some of the other reviewers here is not saying much, but when I first started listening to Styx, all I had to go by were the radio hits that get played all the time such as: Come Sail Away, Renegade, Lady, Babe, etc. For many years those were the only songs I listened to on my greatest hits cd of Styx. Later I began to appreciate songs like Suite Madame Blue and Crystal Ball.  This concert was the first time I ever heard Snowblind and the first time I ever listened to the whole of Grand Illusion, both of which I now find to be excellent songs.    As for the DVD, it has excellent camera angles, a decent amount of special features, excellent video, and  superb sound.  The concert itself is great, all the vocals are excellent and although they don't sound the same as a studio recording, one would almost prefer some of these renditions to the studio versions.  I rented this DVD first to see if it was worth buying and it definetely is.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you're a fan of Pride and Prejudice, this movie is for you.  It's a movie, once again, in which the main characters misunderstand each other. Our hero in this movie is much, much darker and has a more fiery temper than Mr. Darcy.  Our heroine, while not quite as appealing as Elizabeth Bennett, does grow on you as the film progresses.  If you like the 6-hour A&E production of Pride and Prejudice, this will definitely do the trick.
B00005JPUN|3.0|good version of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" but not as good as the   original. If you look there are even the pods even though it's a virus this time( look at the piece of metal the woman hands the CDC man) but you have to pause the movie at just the right half second.
006135323X|5.0|I purchased this book after hearing the author speak about it on NPR. It is so well-written and interesting that I read it in one go (admittedly on a long flight, though). I'm a grad student in economics and so found the book especially exciting as Arielly challenges a lot of the things that we learn in our basic theory courses. Nonetheless, the book is highly relevant to non-economists as well, as so many aspects of our daily life are examined from a different perspective. I highly recommend it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Absolutely mesmerizing and addictive!! Wonderful underlying message. The quirky twists and turns and the imaginative characters make this movie a fantastic adventure:)
B000002O4X|5.0|This has to be one of my very favorite musical scores of all time.  I play the CD at least once a week and it never fails to lift me to a \\"higher place\\".   The score is enchanting and soothing.  I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Soy un gran admirador de Andrea Bocelli y además de la música en general. Este concierto es, sin duda alguna, el mejor de Bocelli. La calidad del sonido es sobresaliente y el repertorio elegido para la ocasión también lo es. Bocelli hace algunas apariciones, sinceramente espectaculares, a dúo con artistas de la talla de Sarah Brightman, Heather Headley y Laura Pausini. Si a usted le gusta la buena música, este es un concierto que debe comprar.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|This seems to be a pretty polarizing flick; most people either loving it or hating it.  Makes me a bit unusual in putting it in the middle.  Since this version of the story clearly couldn't have been done live-action without LOTR-level budgets -- and since the writers include one of the very best of today's graphic novelists -- it seems that the choice to do it all in aniimation was making a virtue of necessity.  Like some other reviewers, I had a hard time getting past the artificiality of the people.  All in all, though, for this viewer it was a worthwhile tradeoff to get all the monster effects that wouldn't --  probably couldn't at this point in the technology -- have blended seamlessly with live-action humans (a la \\"300\\" or \\"Sin City\\").  However, I also had a hard time getting past the comparisons I was making with what stands, for me, as the best Beowulf variant yet:  \\"The 13th Warrior,\\" the great John McTiernan's 1999 film version of Michael Crichton's 1976 book \\"Eaters of the Dead.\\"  It's a complete mystery to me why that movie was (and remains, judging by what used copies go for here at Amazon's Marketplace) such a commercial flop.  But if you enjoyed this telling, you might also enjoy the McTiernan movie.  You should be warned that it's a VERY different take on the story.  The central conceit is that there was a highly civilized (ie, literate) expat from one of the two most advanced societies of the day (an Arab of noble birth, exiled from the caliphate) along for the ride, one of the Beowulf-character's 12 other warriors (hence the title), and Grendel and Gendel's \\"mother\\" turned out to be...  Well, see for yourself, if you care to.  No more spoilers here...
0393057658|3.0|I had high hopes of this book. Would it be another winner's story or would it be about statistics and plain baseball?<br /><br />Actually, the result is kind of both. The book tells us about taking a different approach at scouting while the club is money-strapped. It makes you look beyond the obvious and I must say I had some great results in the Yahoo Hockey League online. But is this the result you go for?<br /><br />Moneyball is full of statistics and tells us a nice but not compelling story. You kind of read your way through it and say: \\"Well, ok, that's nice to know.\\"<br /><br />If you got any spare time and like baseball or scouting go ahead and read the book. Just don't expect too much as I did.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Drama. (My one-word review)     This is not a continuation of Broken Boy Soldier. It is the Raconteurs creating a complete package of material that is in a whole 'nother building from BBS.     This release feels more collaborative and polished. Some songs do seem to have a bit too much going on with extended instrumentals and even some of the chorus/harmonizing might have been pared down because it comes off as a bit 'indulgent.' This is really my only complaint and it is minor. I gave it 5 not 4 stars.    A couple songs sound like what used to be called 'acid-rock' in the early 70's and would have fit in nicely between my Grand Funk Railroad lps and The Who. Specifically, Hold Up & These Stones...fit this description. They are 'reminiscent' not carbon copies.    \\"Old Enough\\" has an almost bluegrass flavour to it. Brendan and Jack harmonize as well as CSNY here.    \\"Top Yourself\\" is a lyrically fun, risque piece that probably could have been sub-titled: 'master of your own domain.' Nothing here the kiddies can't listen to. Subtlety abounds.    \\"Many Shades of Black\\" is uber-dramatic. The singing is sublime. The lyrics, melody and horns make it an atmospheric piece that makes me think of a small dark (aren't they all) nightclub featuring a band too good to be there. I don't know why....    \\"Carolina Drama\\" My review title uses a line from this song. It is a song with a driving beat, driving lyrics and a melody that you can't help but fall into. It is my favorite on the record and should become a classic, much like Eminem's, \\"Stan\\" or even \\"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia.\\" Have a listen, you'll understand. It is brilliant and perfectly sung.    \\"Jack's Voice.\\" Okay, it's not a song title but I have to comment. I think he is one of the most underrated singers out there. He pulls off a brilliant punk-like warble (in this and all his endeavors). He can sing sweetly. There is an 'unpredictable' aspect to his voice that is endlessly fascinating to listen to; random cracks that may or may not be intentional. Brendan is a fantastic singer. But for me, Jack is infinately more interesting.    cheers,  Laurie

1591841992|5.0|This insightful book says that any problem can be solved using a picture.  Author, Dan Roam, quickly warns against saying you cannot draw, because anyone can draw the simple stick figure drawings he suggests.  Roam thinks visual information is much more interesting than verbal information and that even simple drawings are the most effective way to solve problems, sell ideas, or communicate information.  He believes drawings help people crystallize ideas and think more creatively.  The author emphasizes that communicating your ideas effectively is crucial and reminds us that a picture is worth a thousand words.<br /><br />The book begins with the basics of making drawings, charts, and graphs, then moves on to the author's tools for thinking in pictures.  The remaining sections of the book explain how to develop and sell ideas.  The section on developing ideas provides suggested models to use to best represent types of situations.<br /><br />The book presents step-by-step directions on how to clearly present a problem using a set of visual tools - as a series of pictures or a progressively-drawn picture.  His basic instructions include:  1) Make the first mark by drawing a circle and label it something like me, them, you, product, company, etc.;  2) Choose a type of picture to best describe the situation from the categories a who/what portrait, a how-much chart, a where map, a when timeline, a how flowchart, or a why multi-variable xy plot;  3) Anthropomorphize your drawing since people relate to people even if they are just stick-figures with faces;  4) Use mental triggers in your drawing to make a point such as making something bigger or smaller to signify power or using the sun to orient an up or down direction;  5) Draw your picture real-time in front of your audience as a progression of your thought process and describe it as you go rather than presenting a finished drawing;  6) As you finish drawing your picture, write in or draw your conclusion.  7) Because a picture is so powerful, it is important to accurately portray the situation even though the drawing may not be artistic.<br /><br />The book also presents examples of problems that have been solved using the system.  The author emphasizes that you should develop your ideas and solutions and make sure the audience is moving along with you and that they are deducing the same conclusions you are presenting.  You do this by making a progression of pictures or augmenting your drawing, as you simultaneously describe what you are sketching.  The book clearly lays out how to get from the problem to selling the solution.owerful, it is important to accurately portray the situation even though the drawing may not be artistic.

B0013XS8A2|5.0|I agree with most of the reviews found on the web. This time it is a Classical type of music form the Virtuoso Mike Oldfield. It is another orchestral work from him. \\"Incantations\\" has been one of my favorite works from Mike Oldfield. Now it is Music of the Spheres. Great work!!!!!. Definitely a great work from the Master of all Spheres.<br /><br />Mike Oldfield sin duda se ha convertido en un clasico de nuestros tiempos. Asi es, no hay duda alguna que es un genio musical. Vivimos tiempos muy competidos y de cambios muy drasticos con muy pocos vituosos como Mike Oldfield que por mas de 30 a&ntilde;os sigue deleitandonos con su magestuosa musica. Desde que yo era ni&ntilde;o he vivido con su musica, y al igual que miles de fans alrededor del mundo hemos hecho su musica parte de nuestras vidas. Hemos registrado su musica en momentos importantes de nuestras vidas a tal grado que sirven de vehiculo para remontarnos al pasado. Para mi, cada album/CD de Mike Oldfield es como una capsula de tiempo. Es increible este concepto dificil de explicar en palabras pero su musica es parte de mi linea de vida en el tiempo. Curiosamente existe otro fenomeno tambien dificil de explicar que consiste en saber que es lo que uno espera de el, es como si muchos de los fans supieramos que es lo que sigue en la historia musical de M.O. Probablemente es tanto lo que escuchamos y re-escuchamos de su musica que se vuelve infecciosa a tal punto de poder \\"sentir\\" y/o \\"presivir\\" que es lo que viene despues. Es una sinergia increible y eso que no he tenido el gusto de conocerlo personalmente.<br /><br />Ya se sentia que venia un trabajo lleno de majestuosidad como lo es componer musica con orquesta. Eso es \\"Music of the Spheres\\".<br /><br />Al igual que muchos fans tengo todos sus LPs/CDs/LDs/DVDs/posters, etc... en fin, toda una inversion en tiempo y esfuerzo que me deja un buen sabor de coleccionista de la musica de un virtuoso de nuestros tiempos.<br /><br />Otros artistas como Paul McCartney han hecho trabajos de \\"musica clasica\\" con una duracion de mas de 70 minutos (p.ej. Standing Stone). Mike Oldfield tiene mas creatividad para producir algo mas alla de los 45 minutos. Somos muchos los fans hambrientos de buena musica y 45 minutos apenas y satisfacen nuestro apetitos. Que tal algo asi como \\"Incantations\\", o \\"Amarok\\", o algo asi como \\"The Songs of Distant Earth\\"?.<br /><br />Felicidades a Mike Oldfield por otra gran joya musical!!. Hats off!!!.<br /><br />Eduardo Nava.<br />Mexico City.duracion de mas de 70 minutos (p.ej. Standing Stone). Mike Oldfield tiene mas creatividad para producir algo mas alla de los 45 minutos.

B0012Q94QW|5.0|I thought this movie was fun and with some imagination everyone should be able to enjoy it. Since we don't actually know what it was like to live back in 10,000 bc, it shouldn't be that difficult to watch. AS far as we know, the scientists and archaeologists could be all wrong with their dating and Egyptians could have used mammoths to build the pyramids. Anyway, the movie had a perfect ending the the guy getting the girl, the bad guys being killed in an awesome way, and the tribes becoming united.

B000NA2776|3.0|I first heard Mika on some late night music television channel in Amsterdam during the arrival of Sinter Klaus, the song was Big Girl (You Are Beautiful) and it had a great sound and was just fun fun fun!  Then in January here in the States Mika preformed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and again I was treated to another playful song (Love Today).  I simply had to buy the album.<br />There are a bunch of really fun and exciting songs on this album, and some sentimental slower songs (I'm not too much into such tunes), but friends and associates have all asked to listen and borrow it and like them all.
B000G03Q3W|4.0|There's no reason for this to be an unsung La Boheme, yet EMI has let it kick around mostly in highlights without much notice. The recording dates from 1980, at a time when all the major classical labels seemed to be using the so-called National Philharmonic, in actuality a pick-up band of London free lances. They were a good group, and James Levine made fine use of them, mostly for RCA. I imagine he drifted over to EMI following Renata Scotto, who reigned supreme at the Met and had a close tie to him.<br /><br />One can't fault Levine here -- he offers alert leadership with lots of tender discretion where it's called for. He risks underplaying a famous tearjerker to give it more dignity. As for the singers, Kraus was a born Rodolfo, and his gleaming lyric tenor wraps itself naturally, if a bit coolly, around Puccini's lines. Scotto is Scotto, dramatically astute and intense but with a voice that can become shrill and wayward under pressure. The two leads make a convincing romantic pair, with one caveat: neither sounds innocent or shy. I'd call them assured, even knowing, which gives a slightly off color to their charactrizations compared with the sentimental, coltish lovers one usually imagines. Milnes is caught in best voice as Marcello, and thankfully he doesn't bellow or become overbeating. Carol Neblett's Musetta is accurate and well sung, but she's not sexy or fun in the cafe scene.<br /><br />Indeed, the prevailing fault in this performance is that it tneds to be rather grave, and Levine gets a case of the slows here and there (as in the Act I love duet), a habit that pays expressive dividends in the opera house but less so on records. EMI's recorded sound is fine, with any digital shrillness being tamed on top. In the end, only the somewhat reserved singing and conducting keep me from rating this Boheme higher -- one must acknowledge how stiff the competition is.

B000002KHY|4.0|Everyone born before 1980 is familiar with the music of James Taylor.  He was on the leading edge of the singer / songwriter movement in the 70's and was a constant of top 40 radio throughout that time period.  The \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is just that, a collection of Taylor's big hits up through 1976.  Pretty much every song here should be familiar to most people and there really is not a dud in the bunch.  Taylor's laid back songwriting style is somewhat deceiving, as his lyrics often evoke serious subject matter and contain a depth that many others of this ilk lack.  Along with the studio hits, one highlight of this album is the last cut a live version of \\"Steamroller\\" that highlights a side of Taylor not always seen.  The song is lowdown blues /funk finding Taylor stepping out of the laid back soft sound he is known for substituting it with a gritty beefy delivery.  This single disc hits set just barley scratches the surface of what Taylor is all about, but it is a fine little collection for what it is.
0143038419|2.0|Like many, after hearing so my hype about this book, I bought it. After reading only the first five pages, I was put off by the author's tone. She is glib, obnoxious and self-depreciating--and not in a humorous way. The tone only grew more arrogant as I read the rest of the novel, and I'm still not sure where I see her attaining spiritual growth...I see her eating too much, whining about her pants not fitting, and shacking up with some man at the end despite swearing off men.  I had realized the book wouldn't be a travelogue, and being a memoir, would focus on the author; however, the author is very unlikeable and doesn't seem to see anything outside herself.  I was just completely disappointed by the novel, and it pained me to finish it...I just kept hoping it would redeem itself; however, it only got worse.

B0010X745K|2.0|This review will contain spoilers.    The Mist is a so-so monster movie that yearns to be more, tries to force itself into being something more and fails miserably.    The movie works 'ok' when it's just about people being trapped in a supermarket and being preyed upon by creepy unseen creatures in the mist.  The creatures are obviously CGI and do deliver some gruesome kills but they are never particularly scary; the best of the bunch are the ones we never get a good look at and can only guess at their monstrosity from their vague outlines in the mist (go figure: leaving something to the imagination).    What really bothered me about this movie was the 'drama'.  It never really rung true to me.  Sure, the local religious nut who thinks the mist is the coming of the end-times was believable, but having twenty other people become her 'followers' demanding a child's blood sacrifice after a COUPLE OF DAYS?  Unbelievable even for a cynic like me.  I know people tend to mob-up and do irrational things when hard times hit but these characters just hadn't gone through enough to justify their actions.    Likewise, I feel the same about the much-reviled ending.  Essentially, 5 people escape the supermarket with 4 bullets left in their gun.  They drive 300 miles and they see monsters, mass destruction, and an apocalyptic landscape.  They run out of gas and within 5 minutes decide to off themselves.  The gunman, the lone survivor, then stumbles out of the truck only to discover that the army was not five minutes away - oh the humanity.    While the ending is brutal, it's totally unjustified and almost seems like a tacked on finale.  Who are these losers who give up so easily?  Sure, it's the end of the world, but wouldn't you rather go out swinging, yelling and screaming?  Not these characters: they pack it in when they run out of gas - WOW.    If anything can be said about human nature it is that people will go to great lengths to survive.  I just read The Terror by Dan Simmons which is about 105 men stuck in the ice at the North Pole for two years while being stalked by a monster.  These guys suffer: scurvy, lost limbs, starvation, cannibalism, but they continue on simply because of their will to survive.    The ending of the original novella was bleak but offered up the solace of \\"well, there is always hope\\".  Not much I guess, but way better than the movie which seems to say, \\"better to kill yourself than live through another day of suffering and the chance to...live another day.\\"          Quick gripes that really incriminate the filmmakers for being sloppy and obvious with their storytelling:    -Dead can Dance song at the end; melodramatic and jarring   -Characters standing around telling the audience about human           nature; please just show us   -Did the guy's wife really have to be all webbed-up on the front           porch?  Wouldn't a webbed-up house have said it all?
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Superman II had some very big shoes to fill following the thoroughly entertaining origin film. I watched both versions of the film back to back and I have come to the conclusion that the theatrical release is a better film. That is not to say that the \\"Donner\\" cut isn't without merit. I liked his cut very much, but it's unfinished and had he been able to complete his film, I think it could have been better than the theatrical release. Lester on the other hand, doesn't deserve too much credit because he already had 3/4 quarters of a good film to work with. This sequel is very good, but for me it strays too far from the comic book. This is an \\"anything goes\\" version of Superman. I would have loved to see some flashbacks to Clark's youth in Smallville because I felt they rushed past that in the first film. All and all this is a sequel that is not to be missed! The Transfer on the super Superman box set is excellent and there are two additional discs of extras including the \\"Donner\\" cut.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|I know this movie is almost universally despised, but I can't stop loving it! There just aren't any faults substantial enough to compromise the sheer entertainment value of this film! The cinematography is fantastic, the music is great, the CGI effects are astounding (especially when you turn on the 5.1 surround sound), the story is entertaining, and the cast works. Ben Affleck is no worse an actor than Orlando Bloom or Colin Farrell or any of the other new Hollywood heartthrobs, Josh Harnett is good, and if I were either of them, I'd fall for Kate Beckinsale too! The love triangle plot may be hackneyed, but I can't help being moved by it. Makes me wish I were 25 again. The budget obviously didn't allow for filming in Japan, so the scenes of the attack planning were also shot in Hawaii, doubling for Japan, but even so, effort is made within the confines of the film to show the Japanese, especially naval genius Isoroku Yamamoto in a noble light. For historical accuracy, I'll turn to books or the History Channel, but for superb youthful entertainment, I'll come back to this movie over and over again. Get the director's cut for the full-effect of the action scenes.
B000V6BE6C|1.0|Some of the songs on this album are half decent until the vocals kick in.  I really dont understand what the singer has against singing lessons, but he could benefit from them.  My favourite part about A7X songs is the way each chorus sounds like the Spice Girls are doing guest vocals.  Oh by the way, Rob Halford called, he wants his sunglasses and leather vest back.
B00132D808|2.0|I wanted to like this album; REALLY wanted to like it. I tried, I listed start to finish, and went back to songs I thougth I might pick up eventually. No luck. The general consensus seems to be that this release leaves much to be desired. I really liked their last album...no wait, it was simply amazing.     I'm seeing a lot of the \\"they're maturing as a band\\" and \\"they're trying to stand out, be different\\" as well as other variations of this argument. For those who feel this is the case, let me ask you this....What band, with 5 or more extremely successful releases, changed their sound, formula, and style THIS significantly? Few to none. Good bands find something that works and stick with it. Panic should have stuck with what worked in their debut...fast, energetic, and fun. Maybe they didn't know how to repeat that success?    Pretty Odd is boring, confused, and repetitive. I thought the new Linkin Park was bad, but this now takes the cake. How are they even a band? I dont even hear guitars or drums much. How do they plan to perform this album live? The first track is especially frustrating...why did they feel the need to record a disclaimer?? We know all bands are away and busy writing music when they're not touring.    The one thing I do like are the vocals. The lead's voice is still good, just wish they took better advantage of it.    Oh well, maybe they get the hint and fix it for their third effort.
B000I5Y8ZU|1.0|I write this as a warning to all who may order this cd!  Before I purchased this album, I was a healthy, heterosexual male in the prime of my life.  I took one listen to it, and the effect was instant.  I awoke the next morning to discover that I had...changed!  My hair grew into a carefully groomed swoop that covered one of my eyes.  I noticed scars on my wrists where there previously WERE no scars.  I traded my girlfriend for a boyfriend, and I started keeping a diary full of my deep and insightful thoughts on how hard life is.  Oh by the way, look out for my bands new album coming out this fall, Avenged Chemical Boy.

B00005JPTK|5.0|Though I do own the novella, I haven't had a chance to read it yet - so many books, so little time! Now that I've seen the film, I'm pushing this story to the top of my reading list, though I know it and the film have their differences.   I've been a fan of sci-fi, fantasy and horror since I was a child and I'm as fascinated by those genres now as I was way back when. What I often find lacking in a lot of those aforementioned genres is character developement. I believe that the director did a fantastic job in capturing that and more. The isolation! No human contact of any kind for 3+ years. An empty New York City is so bizarre to see. All Neville had for companionship was his dog Sam and some video store mannequins. The constant vigilance and fear of being found by \\"The Nightseekers\\". Always aware of the fact that Sam could be at risk of turning into one of...them. The disappointment of numerous failed attempts at a cure. The emptiness, the sheer boredom of a life full of pretty much nothing but monotony.  I don't want to reveal any spoilers, but at one point during the movie I sobbed like a baby. In my almost 40 years only a handful of movies have made me lose it like that. I even noticed my husband wiping tears from his eyes. Those who have seen the film should know exactly what scene I'm talking about and no, it's not the ending.  This movie isn't an easy one to see. The conditions are harsh and the situation is extremely dire. Some of you may want to grab some tissues before you sit down to watch it.
B00005JPTK|3.0|Watching \\"I Am Legend\\" is truly a frustrating experience and one of the greatest letdowns in movie history.     The sci-fi plot device of a virus wiping out most of humanity is very effective and completely believable. Inevitably, this has to be compared to the film \\"28 Days Later\\", which is essentially identical in plot. However, where these two films dramatically diverge is in the way each protrays the infected survivors.     In \\"28 Days Later\\", you can make the case that it is very unlikely that someone could be infected and within 20 seconds become a raging animal. However, all the infected people in \\"Days\\" are played by real actors, and the performances are riveting and believable. The first hour of \\"I Am Legend\\" is one of the greatest hours in sci-fi film history, as we are given a tour of New York City three years after virtually all of its population has been wiped out. The decay of this city is completely plausible, as Will Smith's character lives to survive, remain sane, and continues to work towards finding a cure for the virus.      Where this film changes from greatness to schlock is when we see the infected survivors, who are not played by real people, but are in fact cheap CGI creations. Not only are they not remotely believable, but they exhibit physical abilities that no disease could create in real human beings. All this does is render the film as cheap fantasy instead of plausible science fiction. One key plot point is the single infected survivor that Will Smith has captured and uses for trials to find a cure. Towards the end of the film, the cure has finally been found, and the infected person begins to show signs that they are returning to normal. Since this is the only infected person played by a real actor, it would have enhanced the film to see this person return to a cognitive, rational state and communicate with Will Smith. The film is only 90 minutes and appears to have suffered from budget constraints. There are only two good actors in the film; Will Smith and his German Shepherd, Samantha. When he meets his first healthy survivors, the woman is played by some unknown spanish actress. Clearly, great attempts were made to keep the cast salaries down, which is unforgivable considering that there are less than 10 speaking parts in this film. What a shame. This film could have been so much more.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|-- No spoilers --    Will Smith surely gave this movie his ALL, and that's saying quite a lot. It takes a lot of courage and ability for one actor to carry a movie like this, yet he does it with ease. The earlier parts of the movie with he and his dog, Sam, are engaging and absorbing.  And these, merged with the flashback motif to bring the viewer into an understanding of what had happened in the past, up to the present moment of the movie work very well, indeed.    It's the rest of it that just didn't work for me. And that comprised an inertia of poor movie-making that not even Will Smith could overcome.     When we saw creatures like this in \\"The Mummy\\" (the Brendan Fraser versions), they worked in a fantasy way, but in that surreal/comical atmosphere, they fit in and \\"made sense\\". In \\"I Am Legend\\" they do not.    Can you think of anything about a lethal, debilitating virus that would give anyone unbelievable, superhuman speed and strength?  Can you imagine humans rendered so demented by a disease that although able to set subtle traps to catch prey, they'd hurl themselves heedlessly into objects that would rip themselves to pieces?     Again and again I kept saying, \\"This just doesn't make any sense!\\"      And then you meet the immune \\"survivors\\" and the story progresses down an even more unbelievable line.  By the end of the movie you can't help but think, \\"What a waste of Will Smith.\\"    Can Will Smith carry a movie almost entirely by himself? You bet he can! And he does a better job of it than anyone else I can think of. Had this movie not had Will Smith, and Sam the dog, it would have been unendurable. But because of them and Will's enormous talent, it rose from two-stars to three, in my opinion.  But if you really enjoyed the movie for its \\"horror\\" aspects, see those Brendan Fraser Mummy movies again...they were much better made.
0634029355|5.0|I've played guitar for over 40 years, but it's been mostly folk music and classical and I only got bitten by the Blues Bug about 2-3 years ago - and EC was the prime reason for that (and also for my initially starting guitar back in '67 when he was in Cream, but I was looking at it more from a Rock than Blues perspective back then, not understanding when I was 15 how Rock evolved and is based on the Blues).      I first used this DVD to learn White Room and Sunshine of Your Love - Doug Bodouch is fantastic at playing and explaining how and why Clapton played it the way he did.  I was able to join a Blues Band playing lead guitar only a few months after buying this because of the proficiency I picked up by learning and playing along with Doug on these DVDs (I also got the Solo Years and Acoustic Classics).      These are HIGHLY recommended by me, and no where does it state these are lessons *BY* Eric Clapton (good luck finding that!).    Jim
B001152TL6|5.0|The five stars are for the film and NOT the new DVD release.  Why it took more than ten years after the theatrical release for Universal to release this on DVD remains a mystery.  A bigger mystery is why they have included none of the available extras on this long awaited DVD. The film print itself looks fine and sounds okay.  It is a dramatic improvment over the pan and scan Canadian import.  I suppose getting the film in widescreen should make me happy (and it does) but still . . . Universal choose not to include so much as the theatrical trailer on this release.  The menus are not even animated. This is as bare bones as a DVD release can get.  Even the lable of the DVD itself is simply black with the words LOST HIGHWAY printed on it.  I suspect that in six months to a year we will see the \\"Special Edition\\" of this appear and those of us who are hardcore Lynch fans will fork over the money again.  /////  And yes, to all future reviewers:   Please stop trying to explain the plot or interpret the film. If anyone wanted to read that stuff we could go to a discussion forum.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|It is unlikely I have seen a more misogynistic film since Neil LaBute's [[ASIN:0767806786 In the Company of Men]], but director Mike Nichols uses his uncanny ability to delve deep into the human condition to come up with a challenging, superbly acted and at times surprisingly empathetic film about four self-absorbed, unsympathetic people. I'm not sure what other director could have been better qualified to translate Patrick Marber's stinging, cynical play set in an urban chic London. As he has proven from his 1966 debut, [[ASIN:B000I2JDEY Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]] through 1971's [[ASIN:B00000K0DP Carnal Knowledge]] to 2003's [[ASIN:B0001I2BUI Angels in America]], Nichols knows how to humanize the brutality and emotional pain that people can inflict on each other. This master filmmaker's skill is what prevents this 2004 drama from shriveling up into a wearing exercise in manipulation and deceit.<br /><br />Writing the screenplay from his own play, Marber provides dialogue that is alternately sharp, observant and harshly erotic. At times, his acerbic work reminds me of Frederic Raphael's superb 1960's screenplays for [[ASIN:B0000CNY4S Darling]] and [[ASIN:B000AP04MO Two for the Road]]. The story that brings the four characters into a sexual intersection of tête-&agrave;-têtes and one-upmanship does get rather convoluted. The film covers about four years in elapsed time but takes liberties with scene transitions, focusing on the beginnings and endings of relationships and consequently complicating the chronology and timing of events, sometimes unnecessarily. Suffice it to say that each character figures out his or her capacity for hurting someone else and then goes about feeling empowered, guilty or some combination of both. It is telling that there are hints and often threats of physical abuse in the dialogue, but nothing is executed until a final, defining slap, filmed in slow motion, of course.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly strong, though I believe the \\"beautiful people\\" aspect of the casting does distance the actors from the audience, perhaps intentionally. I am not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but she surprises as Anna, the photographer who becomes the focal point of a shark-infested triangle. Looking rather sallow and absurdly thin, Roberts doesn't come across as all that attractive here, but her sullen demeanor seems to free her from the contrivances Hollywood has offered her for the previous fifteen years. It seems inevitable that she is now playing the older woman archetype now, and she accepts her fate with a seasoned truthfulness that propels the rest of the characters. That she gives the weakest performance among this quartet is a tribute to the high caliber of the talent involved. At first, Jude Law plays Dan, the ethically challenged writer who fails as a novelist, as a hopeless romantic, but what he gradually uncovers is a tormented soul weakening under the burden of his deceptions. It's a brave performance especially since his character is the one most willing to hurt the others deeply for his own selfish motives.<br /><br />As Larry, the equally manipulative and sexually insecure dermatologist, Clive Owen sinks his teeth into a role that makes the most of his swarthy onscreen persona. His emotional nakedness and bull-in-a-china-shop approach to his problems make a brutishly affecting counterpoint to Law's rather effete character. In her adult breakthrough, Natalie Portman is alternately vulnerable and bruising as Alice, the stripper who falls hard for Dan and won't give Larry the intimacy he needs when he is rejected by Anna. She tantalizes with her flighty sexuality and then grounds her character deeply when she is subject to an excruciating break-up from Dan. Her character's evolution, however sketchily it is presented, is the only one that achieves a poignancy that nearly transcends the story's cynicism. I have to admit the unrelenting tone does induce a numbing effect that makes you wonder whyyou should care about the fate of any of the characters. But leave it to Nichols to make you want to know what happens to each of them. The only significant extra in the 2005 DVD is a music video of Damien Rice's haunting \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", which is used effectively as a musical bridge for their comings and goings. Highly recommended though don't expect to feel life-affirmed afterward.ate of any of the characters. But leave it to Nichols to make you want to know what happens to each of them.

B000YENUI6|5.0|Amazingly this is a gangster movie without too much predictability. While we see the usual characters in most gangster movies, i.e. the good gangster, the bad gangster, a girl and the big bad wolf, these key characters were enough to keep the story flowing from start to finish. The opening sequence catches your attention straightaway and you expect no-holds-barr action from then on. All said, the story didn't have continuous scenes of senseless violence. Every scene seemed measured and inserted only to give the story a true representation of what each character was after. Though at times, Naomi Watts' character did seem a little weak as if nothing much was written for her but it was merely understandable as she is nothing but a mere innocent mortal caught in the Russian web of deceit. The ending did leave me wondering which path did Viggo finally take (that which I shall not give too much information on).
B000JIHP88|5.0|Ok.  I rarely review products on Amazon but I just had to post my thoughts on this mobile.  My baby had a really hard time falling asleep.  I am not kidding when I say because of this mobile I can now lay her down, turn it on and it actually PUTS HER TO SLEEP.  This has de-stressed our bedtime routine immensely.  She loves it.  We do all the things we normally would but instead of her crying when I lay her down she watches and listens to this mobile contently until she falls asleep.  Also, when she wakes super early I can use the handy remote, turn it on and she coos at it for a while so i don't have to jump up right away.
B00132D808|5.0|So there first CD was great...it was every college's anthem for a while...played everywhere \\"indie Darlings\\"...blah blah blah..we get it...sorry though if you thought they would continue the trend of High School prom night bands...and the Emo/Scene fad...\\"no girl is bleeding on a ballroom floor in this one for attention\\"... lucky for those who have an appreciation for music and the absolutely amazing artistic side of things...see that this album is what they really wanted to be, they grew up!!...and with a little bit of Luck and (money and time) they were able to create an album that really represents them as musicans...not just to be heard at some \\"college Frat party\\" over and over and over again \\"a fever\\" was a great album...but if your looking for high energy Synth's/cute catchy Electric guitar,with \\"emo\\" lyrics... you dont really get that in this album..it's a Beatles influenced album with that raw indie voice over top of it...well done...well produced...not over produced techno bullcrap...with some flashing bells and whistles...they brought back tastefully odd old school on us...and that's okay with me...for all the rest...go listen to your fall out boy and cry about it and wait around for the next fad to leach onto...but for those who want to try something new and refreshing but not necassarily original sounding...it's pretty odd sounding.

1400064287|5.0|I adore this book and not just because of the cool duct-tape cover. It should be required reading for anyone in the business of persuasion (that includes entrepreneurs, marketing and sales pros, teachers, writers, and many more). It's an entertaining read that's full of terrific stories and examples to illustrate the authors' points.
B000GCFO0I|1.0|Keep in mind that I am a big fan to the video games, which are excellent in plot and scariness. When I heard the first game was to be adapted to the screen, I was ecstatic. The director, Gans, through interviews, said he was a huge fan of the games and seemed to know everything about the story and even talked to the makers of the games for help. I was completely convinced that it was going to be a psychological horror film that covered complex thoughts and emotions through its characters, especially since one of the writers of \\"Pulp Fiction\\", Avery, was doing the screenplay for it. Since the video game was incredible for game critics, I was thinking that perhaps the movie would have the same praise to movie critics as \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" (the film that inspired the Silent Hill games) did.       The first day the movie was out in theaters, I bought a ticket to see it. I was very excited since the teaser trailer was incredible (not the 3 minute previews shown in theaters or tv later on) so when I finally saw the film....I was incredibly disappointed.       The film seems to be directed by a college student who had no respect for the plot or its characters since the plot from the game was tangled up to the point where I couldn't even understand what was happening. The film doesn't even have an original soundtrack, it just recycled music from the video games. The dialogue is atrocious and the acting is worse especially with the cult members. If you change the audio settings to another language then you might have a better time watching the film, but of course, the plot is still bad.       I will say that the art production is incredible. The makeup and effects are top-notch, looking like it came straight from the game but even better by detail and monster effects. It was a great experience being able to see a couple of my favorite monsters from the game be represented on film in the real world. This is where the movie deserves props.       Unfortunately, the incrediblevisuals cannot save the film due to its horrible care to the original plot, the corny dialogue, and forgettable characters with bad acting. Before I saw the movie, I thought the critics were insane to trash this movie, but after I saw it, I realized how truly bad it is. Even if you did not play the games, you will not get the plot, especially its cliche of a climax, and its unsatisfying and confusing ending. The movie's not even scary, the most important characteristic to a horror film!      If you are still not convinced to stay away from the film, then please save your movie until the film is priced to at least 10 or 5 dollars new.

I know people rave about the book and author. I do follow the Skype sessions.  Listening to what other book clubs are getting out of this book which is great for them.  I ordered the book with my eyes open, knowing it was spiritual.  I will keep going but sometimes it is difficult.    The book was received in perfect condition and delivery was quick.  thank you.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|I have never bought a Kanye West CD before; or many at all, for that matter. Usually I just download music on my computer, but thought this CD would be worth my while. Mr. West is definitely one of my favorite rappers. With that said, I was quite disappointed with the songs on this album; that I have not yet heard on the radio... He actually tries to sing on certain tracks. To put it nicely, he really must stick to rapping. The album art, I think once again by Murakami, is wonderful. I gave this CD review 3 stars because I do love love love his craft, but would suggest listening to the songs before you choose to buy. Whenever I listen to the CD, I fast forward through half of his tracks.

They work through Nero, which interferred with other software on my computer and to top it all off, I ended up with no access to the climactic final 100 pages.  I don't need this kind of frustrastion in my life and advise your customers to avoid Audible Books.  Amazon should drop Audible.

B000002UAX|5.0|Hadn't heard this in years, just listened to it all the way through. So many moods and textures and so much weirdness. Lennon is so clearly whacking his brain this way and that; Happiness Is A Warm Gun is one of the most obvious junkie's laments in all pop music, and from the sounds of I'm So Tired he wasn't loving his habit too much. Paul's contributions are sublime at times and schmaltzy at others but that's Paul; still, Blackbird is evergreen, and Savoy Truffle is a good shot at John's ersatz mysticism. You can see the beginning and the middle of the end of the McLennon partnership here. It's every man for himself.<br /><br />George's tunes have their moments, Weeps is still sweet, Clapton's leads add a new feel, some of his better playing.<br /><br />Ringo's tunes are, well, Ringo tunes.<br /><br />All in all, a ton of unique and melodically inventive music, new darkness from John (and Yoko, thanks for that, O Great Artist of song and vision, gag), and with cuts like Rev 9 and Helter Skelter, an album which proved that the Beatles could be as weird and rock as hard as most anyone out there.<br /><br />Just another masterpiece of creativity, ho hum.<br /><br />What other group has an album this wide-ranging? Not many...<br /><br />And it's not even close to being their best record. Astounding.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I highly recommend this DVD for the hardcore Superman fans.  The scenes with Jor-El (Marlon Brando) were superior to Lester's version.  Also Donner's scene of Lois shooting Clark Kent with a gun (albeit a blank, to prove he's Superman) is superior to Lester's version of Clark tripping into the fireplace.  I always hated how Lester's version added new Super-powers to all 4 Kryptonians (that did not exist in the comics).  My only criticism of both films is too much dumb humor in the Lex Luthor scenes.   I prefer the cold sinister Lex Luthor in Superman Returns.
0451196716|4.0|Having grown up without the allowance of Stephen King within my household, I have only recently discovered the sheer genius of his writing.  This one, written as an alter ego by the name of Richard Bachman (in the edition I read, there is an intro by King explaining this), strikes me as brilliant.  First, the way that King creates his character profiles ever so slowly, with foreshadowing of what is to come of each of them based on their personality but never revealing everything at once, is the perfect way to intrigue a reader and draw him or her into the story from the beginning.  King himself admits to having a dark side that he often represses when writing because in real life, so many things do have happy endings, and he wants his work to reflect real life.  In reading this novel, which goes on and on at such a pace that you can't stand the thought of putting it down, you can see that happy ending from the very beginning.  The Long Walk can have only one winner, and since the story is told through the eyes of Ray, a single individual, you know who is going to win from the first, despite a couple of really good scares when you think you are wrong.  But remember, this isn't a King novel, it's a Bachman novel, and Bachman throws in a strange and incomprehensible surprise at the end.  Well written as a King novel with the twist of a more morbid alter ego, The Long Walk is gripping and delightfully fear inspiring, and by far my favorite King read yet.

B000002O4X|5.0|Worth seeing again for so many visual and emotional rewards, not the least being Streep's maticulous performance, a masterful blending of three books into a coherent whole.  However the commentary provided by producer/director Sydney Polack provides so much background detail that it lifts so many of this film's riches.  The production details, the performances by Streep and Redford make this a cinematic event deserving its eight Oscars.  With the commentary this ought to be a must on a winter's night to be warmed by your fire, marshmallows, cognac and to be taken to Africa.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I hate the fact the show was canceled (which I still say it shouldn't have been.) On the positive side it gave this movie a chance to be written. I love it. Start to finish. I can't wait for Continuum! The cast was fantastic (as always.) Ben Browder was brilliant. I just can't say enough good things about this movie.  (maybe with the next movie people who haven't seen it, won't review it and mess up the ratings.)
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I'm not usually a big fan of romantic comedies, but I enjoyed \\"Love Actually\\" nonetheless, mostly because the performances by the various actors were entertaining and the pacing was brisk enough that I didn't get bored even though the movie is over two hours long. There are perhaps too many story lines, but overall this is a good choice if you like British humor and don't mind romantic cliches.  I give this a low 4 stars.

B00005JPSM|3.0|No Reservation is a predictable romantic comedy about a successful, bossy, territorial, temperamental spinster cook who one day finds herself in a situation that left her to care for a young bereaved girl and you can guess from here how this little girl will change her banal life and help her open to life. The movie uses the show of her anger and even the little girl's tantrum to inject humor in the film however hey both never recover from this and which might give the impression that such behavior is acceptable and I totally feel against that. It's a romantic comedy and is peppered with some very foot tapping and hum able songs and.

B000Z6MIQS|5.0|Yes, the verses and intros to songs might be a bit different but the choruses are thumping, rocking Simple Plan choruses, overall I think it's a great album.

I ordered the Deluxe edition as I wanted to see the behind the scenes, and it was well worth it!!

From the first track to the last  this album is a masterpiece. Basically anything Max Cavalera does is brutal. This album is a must have. If you love metal and don't pick up this cd then you might as well just shoot yourself now.

B0013D8LOK|2.0|Musicals about serial killers is a tough cinematic sub-sub-genre.  Peoples' reactions to them vary widely.  Like Edward Lewis said to Vivian Ward about opera: \\"They either love it or they hate it.  If they love it, they will always love it.  If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul.\\"  I count myself in that second group -- before the learning to appreciate part.<br /><br />Burton's style is just not that appealing.  I *can* appreciate the sheer artistry of his work, everything from the original \\"Batman\\" to \\"Corpse Bride,\\" but it just doesn't speak to me.  It's depressing and pointless, and elevates style and mood over plot and character development.
B0013FBS20|5.0|Rocked! Totally rocked! I love any movie that can give me a great visual representation of the gulf that separates mass humanity from the isolation of a few survivors. Especially if NYC is the setting. Nothing to me is a more potent display of this than a deserted NYC.<br /><br />It's foolish to directly compare this to The Omega Man or the Vincent Price version. This was a rendition of the tale shaped to fit our times.<br /><br />Will Smith showed the most depth as a character that I've ever seen from him. He did a great job depicting how one might feel and act in that situation. He lost all, he's totally alone, he's up against unstoppable forces knowing help will never come, but he feels compelled to do the right thing and keep on fighting. As a Marine, I can severely appreciate that!<br /><br />Special effects were outstanding. I'm a big, big fan of the whole \\"one man against all odds\\" theme and this was a powerful example of that. Even the animated shorts in the special features were mind blowing. If anything, they were even more intense. Great DVD!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|i FIRST WATCHED THIS SHOW IN THE SCIE-FI CHANNEL, WHEN THEY WERE PROMOTING THE MOVIE. THE SHOW HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKEN OFF THE AIR. WOW, IT WAS AWESOME, I WAS HOOKED FROM EPISODE ONE. IT IS FUNNY, WITTY, ENTERTAINING, AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS. THE CHARACTERS HAVE GREAT CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THEM AND IT LOOKS LIKE NOTHING ON TV NOW DAYS. I ALSO SAW THE MOVIE, AND WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED AT THE END, WHY ZOE'S HUSBAND HAD TO DIE, WELL IT JUST MADE NO SENSE. NONETHELESS, VERY CREATIVE, UNIQUE PLOT LINE. FUN CHARACTERS, GREAT STORY, I SIMPLY LOVED IT.
B00006RCNW|5.0|The Shield is one of my favorite series, purely for the fact that the main character is neither the protagonist or the antagonist.  He constantly battles himself and the world.  And he usually wins.    A great series about crooked cops, and the amount of good, and bad they do on the streets.  For anyone who likes cop dramas, great series.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|Fractured, spastic, jerky; a make-it-up-as-you-go series of special-effects sight-and-sound skits without wit or humor or drama, though the result is usually startling since you have no idea what's coming next.      This show will doubtless please fans of Terry Gilliam.  Others, don't even think of buying this.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|This was a movie that was ignored at the box office, but deserves a second peek.  It is a classic fairy tale of disney like proportions...yet with a modern twist.    It is about two worlds that co-exist next to each other and are seperated by a wall.  A young man sneaks over the wall in order to find a falling star and give it to the woman that he thinks he loves.  The fallen star turns out to be Claire Danes.      Also in pursuit of the fallen star are one of a trio of witch sisters played delightfully by Michelle Pfeiffer, and three would be kings who need the star in order to take the throne from their dead father...when they aren not trying to kill each other.    The young man and the star find aid in the form of Captain Shakespeare, played with FLAIR by DeNiro...in one of the great \\"against type\\" casting decisions of recent years.    The story had all of the granduer of a fairy tale while keeping a modern twist on things.  All of the characters are delightful and the story moves right along and concludes under its own power without some \\"out of left field\\" ending.  Most of all though the movie looks spectacular.    In an era when we are bombarded by Gulf War films and gangster pictures it is nice to take a break and lose oneself in an adult fairy tale...much like \\"The Princess Bride\\" of twenty years ago...and this is the film to do it!
B000MZHW40|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater and liked it so much we decided to make it part of our DVD library.

0618918248|5.0|I relished the God delusion and enjoyed the clever arguments that run throughout its pages, especially the one about religion not being the one and only path to goodness and conscience. While many will continue to attack this work, given that fanaticism is on the rise, it would be nice if zealots gave themselves permission to exercise the faculty of thought, instead of rushing to hide behind pages from their holy book.<br /><br />I found the argument about there not being any \\"Christian children/Jewish children/Moslem children\\", but only children of Christian/Jewish/Moslem parents, to be an excellent and very valid point. That religion, thus forced upon the newborn without them having any say in the matter, is but a form of abuse, is one of those truths that many would rather not be heard.<br /><br />The only point I tend to disagree with the author on is in viewing people's need for religion as something that could easily be changed, given the right information. There are many who cannot live without the consolation of something to believe in. Setting his goal as arguing out the need for religion is too ambitious and unrealistic at the moment (unless we have a nice visit from inhabitants of another galaxy, which would make the task easier). Instead, a more achievable aim would have been arguing for observing and enforcing secular rule over all (without exceptions due to \\"cultural sensitivities\\"), stressing the necessity of de-fanging organized religion, and letting it be a private matter, inside the hearts of whoever chooses to keep it, provided that they were really given a choice, a choice which, as Mr. Dawkins rightfully observed, many were not given, and which, if exercised in adulthood, is, in some religions, punishable by death!<br /><br />Contrary to what some of his critics believe, Mr. Dawkins credits the average man with a great deal of inner strength, for it takes that much to acquire the degree of imperviousness to emotional blackmail necessary to step outside of organized religion. I think that is a very optimistic overestimation of the average man on the part of the author.<br /><br />At any rate, Mr. Dawkins did a VERY BRAVE, clever, insightful and absolutely delightful job in this book! Recommended for anyone who wants to really think about religion and not just obey whatever dictums were handed down to them without question. Recommended also for anyone secular at heart and who is in dire need of solace and company at times when religious frenzy, and its dangers, are reaching new heights...or, should I say, lower depths?religion.

0143038419|1.0|I recognized the ashram very quickly. Who does the author think she is fooling?  Here are the clues:  the ashram in the U.S. is in the Catskill Mountains. The founder dies in 1982.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|The movie was very much like Billy Joel's Movin Out in how it set characters in the appropriate time period and made them face situations represented in the music, but instead of Billy Joel, Across the Universe uses songs only by The Beatles. And I was amazed to find out how many of the songs I would have sworn were not by The Beatles.     In Across the Universe we see much of the 1960s American culture through the lives of a few young adults. When Jude comes to the US from England (Liverpool!) he makes some friends who will challenge the way he sees the world - as the world changes around him.     All of the songs were sung by the cast, whether it was Jim Sturgess (Jude), Evan Rachel Wood (Lucy), or anyone else. The singing was great, the song choices were great, and the scenes into which they were incorporated were great. I'm not sure if I should praise the writers or the director or both for the scenes picked and the cast member(s) chosen to sing. There was at least one time when the singing was done by someone who was seemingly just an extra in the film and it was very powerful for me.     I've not been able to understand the storm by which Evan Rachel Wood has taken the film industry. But she was good in this role, but more in her non-talking scenes. Her emotions are great, but I find that most of the time she comes off as too young. Separately, I thought she did a great job singing.     The movie starts well and ends well after a short break in the middle. I thought the story took a dump for a while when working in the psychodelic 60s, but that part did feature a brilliant cameo by Bono. The story was VERY artsy. Sometimes it was a little over-the-top, others it was beautifully artistic. I really enjoyed Across the Universe and the more I think about it, the more I realized how much I liked it.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|I looked forward to \\"The Ark of Truth\\", but, to be honest, it was a disappointment.  In my opinion, the only real purpose of the strangely disconnected replicator sub-plot was to pad the whole thing out to the length of a feature film.  Without the replicators, the whole thing could have fitted into a normal SG1 episode.  Heck - that's probably how it started out, before the TV series got canned.  They tried to jazz up the replicators with animated skeletons but I wasn't fooled.  Those replicators looked *tired*....  :-(    On the positive side, the main plot was more interesting, and I liked the new, hot-looking (big grin) Adria.  But I felt her final clash with Morgan le Fay was a bit inconclusive.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|It would be worth seeing this movie for the photography alone! Absolutely superb, with every shot like a masterpiece of painting. Beautifully told in poetic language. (I saw it in the Spanish version). Viggo Mortensen was perfectly cast, giving a brilliant performance as the soldier-turned-mercenary to the Spanish empire, portraying a weary warrior with a noble heart. A movie that appeals to so many senses and that could easily be seen more than once, because there is so much to take in, and for the quality of the photography alone, it could be enjoyed many times over. Thumbs up to the director of photography, the director, to Viggo, to the rest of the excellent cast, as well as the script-writer!

B000022TSW|5.0|This is a classic that will stand the test of time.  Cartman ain't Bogart, but I guarantee the way that American society is sliding downhill that more guys through the years will watch this more than \\"Casablanca\\".    5 stars for: Filth; expanding on killing Kenny to new heights; and putting Saddam in a cartoon.
0440214041|5.0|Rather shocked to see any negative reviews.  This book is a wonderful page turner.  I was lost in the world of small intelligent law student, fighting for her life inside the world of DC powerhouses and the elite rich.  Gripping.  I still think about the book often, and I read it about 6 years ago.  Great read.
159102594X|3.0|(8) The Blade Itself - Joe Abercombie.  The first book in a three part set - sword and sorcery - and makes no pretense of being a novel in and of itself. This is one of those books where you are introduced to several interesting characters in different plot lines separated by space where you have to assume all will be tied together by the end. Most of this book is the introduction of the characters and the world they live in. The plot of this book is fairly week - but it is to be hoped that the over all series plot is good. The characters and world are finely enough crafted that I will probably order the other two books and hope for the best.

0143038095|3.0|The stories of four Chinese women and their American-born daughters, The Joy Luck Club was a very intriguing and interesting examination into the Chinese culture as well as a reminder that love, loyalty, friendship and compassion know no cultural boundaries or constraints.  Author Amy Tan did a remarkable job of telling the stories of these fascinating women - shadows in their own culture, but yet dynamic and captivating on paper.  Tan told the stories of struggle and hardship, but each journey also had its victories and success along the way.  While four daughters grew in their understanding and appreciation for their mothers, I also grew in my own understanding and appreciation for the Chinese culture and for those immigrants who have made the difficult transition from one culture to my own here in America.    As a Christian, I was intrigued how the book dealt with the universal issues of family, love, purpose and meaning.  I found the book honest about the hardships created by a culture shaped without an appreciation for the equality of women - the pain is real even if it is not allowed to be expressed or shown publicly.  I loved how the book valued the role and influence of the family and also showed the difference between the Chinese and American concepts of this institution.  I also appreciated how this book dealt honestly with disappointment and disillusionment - especially from a lack of understanding between generations and cultures.  It's hard to imagine the hardships faced by Chinese women seeking to pass on their rich cultural traditions to their daughters here in the US - Tan did a great job showing the tug of war waged between old and new, Chinese and American in the lives of her characters.
B001152TL6|2.0|Why doesn't anyone ever actually review the DVD's and not just the movie in these reviews?     I love David Lynch. I follow his work religiously and I absolutely love this film. I've been awaiting an actual DVD release of this for years. Now that it's here, I can't help but feel gypped by him and Universal for putting out this piece of crap disc.    I'm very happy that the film at least got a DVD release. It looks amazing, and it's in widescreen, no complaints there. However, there's absolutley no extras on this disc. NOTHING. Not even a trailer. Why is it that the UK edition comes with 2 discs with extras? Why couldn't they just have made an NTSC copy of that? WHY? SOMEONE TELL ME. RIGHT NOW.    I should have just stuck with my VHS copy. Not like I would have been missing out on much by not purchasing this.
0316001821|5.0|The Lovely Bones - Alice Sebold. Now this is a book with meat, well written, tight, clutches at your emotions without being maudlin. I normally avoid books and movies that are \\"tear jerkers\\"  - not because I dislike the feelings engendered (I do) but because I do not like to be manipulated. The feelings -good or bad - are made real by the intent. If the intent is too force a feeling on the reader - that can be accomplished by even those with little talent on any who have even the dregs of a heart left. You just have to make the good dog die in the end. But to expose you to real emotion with intent OTHER than to get that response, elicited by a truly good writer, is worth the pain it causes. This book is raw, painful, and engaging. Highly recommended.
0810994739|5.0|This was the second book of the series and my son and I read it as soon as it arrived to our house.  Rodrick continues to entertain young readers with his funny way of dealing with situations at home and at school: like when Susan Hefley(his mom) promised him a mom buck for every bag of leaves he picked up, he made the bags really small.  Overall, a very entertaining book for all readers.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I am a longstanding Trekker who seldom bothered with broadcasts of the various Trek series because I cannot stand commercials.  My love for the franchise grew as each incarnation emerged on DVD; each series has moved over one seat in my affections to make room for Star Trek: Enterprise, available at truly a bargain price on Amazon.<br />  Enterprise is a magnificent experience on DVD.  The show laid some solid groundwork in justifying Captain Archer's determination first to get to and then to stay in outer space.  The remainder of the cast also does a stout job of behaving as though all of that other Trek stuff hasn't happened yet.  The effects on the shows are of motion picture quality, and the sound is house shaking.  Granted, Enterprise could have done more, especially in their earlier seasons.  But I no longer am one  in favor of harsh critical assessments where Trek is concerned; people will either enjoy it or they will not.  And so, fellow Trekkers, enjoy.
B000ZN8036|4.0|My students in my high school English class had just finished reading and studying the novel Into the Wild.  They enjoyed it very much and so we were able to watch parts of the movie.  It was a great movie and to my surprise the students mentioned that they were really glad they read the  book first.  It helped them understand the movie better and relate to the action.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|The cleaned up print made the rich blacks blacker and more foreboding. Truly a cinematic feat for the time. Still it is really unpeered in my opine. The extras are great too. The documentary Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner is an approximately three and a half hour long documentary and included interviews with Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos, Jerry Perenchio, Bud Yorkin and Ridley Scott, and also contains several alternate and deleted shots within the context of the documentary itself. This is a must for any Blade Runner fan.
B0010X745K|5.0|I'm a horror snob.  Not out of egotism, but out of necessity.  I was once a die-hard horror fan, but I eventually lost interest in it because it was the same old thing done ad nauseam.  Sure, names, characters, and locations were switched around, but most horror followed the same typical plot path, and I simply gave it up when nothing truly new was presented.  True, we did have some excellent films here and there, but for the most part horror followed the same tried and worn direction.  And it got old.    Well, after seeing 'The Mist', I have to say, to me, it was the best horror film I've ever seen. Hands down. Without giving anything away, it was the absolute darkest, most oppressive, and most situationally horrifying movie I have personally even seen, and I afterwards I was left feeling hollow and cold, almost as if I was dead inside.  Everything crafted in the film fit almost perfectly into the dimensions it was designed, the casting and actors were excellent, and it was a masterpiece of true horror---both from within the human condition, and from beyond with the otherworldly aspects.    I was also pleased how the film created the mood and atmosphere.  Aside from a few mandatory things here and there, most of the more exotic Lovecraftian Horrors lurking in the mist were left in shadow or silhouette allowing our imaginations to fill in the gaps.  Because as we all know, our own minds will create more horrifying things than what can be shown on screen with rubber, makeup, or CGI.      The cast was also very convincing.  Typically I dislike any type of \\"protect the kid\\" situations in a movie, but in this one it worked extremely well because it was done realistically.  The emotional ranges portrayed were also excellent; from terror, anger, religious zealotry, and anguish, it all seemed real.    Another hallmark worth mentioning was, there was very little score used in the film which made it even creepier---maybe about 15 minutes of music total. The rest was eerie ambient sounds or the talking and breathing of the characters. Even the end credits were mostly devoid of music, and instead, the background noises from within the film were used.  This was extremely refreshing, as it not only made it seem more realistic (after all, in real life we don't have personal soundtracks playing in the background), it also emphasized the use of our own senses to convey emotion, sound, or feeling instead of blaring trumpets or French horns telling us how to feel in a certain scene.     Now, onto the inevitable question: How does it stand up with the original story?  It holds up very well.  While the film stays very close to the source material, it still brings readers of the original work (myself included) something new.    Over all this is how horror should be.  This isn't clichéd \\"goreno\\", and it's not predicable Hollywood tripe. It's a film that completely succeeds in immersing the viewer in the mood it's trying to set, and the effect lingers long after the film ends.    I only had two complaints.  The first one was the near overuse of swearing.  I'm not opposed to swearing, after all, vulgarity has become quite well ingrained in our society's speech patterns, but here it almost seemed like the big-boy words were thrown in at random in each scene.  But then again, if I was thrust into the same situations as portrayed in the film, I'd probably be dropping non-stop f-bombs as well.    My second gripe may contains spoilers, so if you don't want to read it, please scroll down to where the spoilers end.  I will say, if you can, DO NOT watch the trailers if you plan on watching this film!    SPOILERS!!!  -   -  -  -  -  -  -  My second gripe was the terrible editing job used on the commercials and the trailers.  The scenes in which they showed the military using flamethrowers and other vehicles ruined the ending for me, because when I didn't see those scenes, I rightly suspected it was the very end.  Not cool!  (Why do commercial directors and editors think it's acceptable to put a film's ending in the previews?)  Ugh...  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  SPOILERS FINISHED, REVIEW CONTINUES:        So why should you buy this?  This film was a powerhouse of emotion, terror, and suspense, and it successfully reinvents the horror genre to how it should be.  It also sets the bar for all future horror films to follow.  It's not catered to the least common denominator, it's not mindless, and it's not the typical faire thrown on the screen to make a few dollars.  Long after the film ends you are left haunted by the actions---or inactions made by the various characters, and you can't help but place yourself into the same situation and wonder what you would do.      This was a genuine work of art that not only takes a bold new direction to film, but it also takes some huge chances, as those who have seen the film will know.    Highly recommended.
B000TGJ8A8|4.0|This title is already released on Blu-Ray in the UK so this is a review based on my viewing of this film on Blu-Ray. This will however, not be a review of picture quality or menu fluidity. This will simply be a review about the movie itself, the characters, scenery and the story are all something I will touch upon.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer for \\"NEXT\\" I thought it seemed a bit too corny and a bit too full of CGI to even give us a credible storyline. However I was proven wrong when, after a recommendation from a friend I decided to get this on Blu-Ray.<br />From the first few minutes of this film I knew my first impressions of this film were clouded by partial judgment, as within the first few minutes we were subjected to a slick and stylish action thriller.<br /><br />The story is that a small time Vegas strip magician known as Cris Johnson has an extraordinary gift to be able to see 2 minutes ahead. This to Cris is a curse as he is never surprised and as a child subjected him to rigorous testing which left him bitter and lonely. After Cris sees that a man is about to rob the Casino, he tries to stop him which leads to a misunderstanding and means that Cris has to leave. After stylishly dodging each security guard he manages to escape the Casino and the clutches of the FBI who are chasing him for another reason. A group of Russian terrorists gain possession of a Nuclear device and threaten to set it off in L.A. The Russians want to kill him and the FBI want him to help them prevent this major terrorist situation, the only problem is that Cris is always two minutes ahead of schedule.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage has never really been my favourite actor, but in roles such as this he really pulls off the character brilliantly. Cris Johnson is a man that has never been surprised, he's always been able to tell what happens next and this has helped him escape some sticky situations.<br /><br />Jessica Biel plays the love interest, that admittedly has no real depth to her character or any sort of dimension that would make us care for her and their relationship.<br /><br />Julianne Moore plays the hardarse FBI agent who simply wants him to help prevent the possible deaths of 8 million people. She simply wants him to help prevent the tragedy then to send him on his way, but as she comes to know Cris and how he feels and works she becomes more emotionally involved and it eventually becomes a relationship that is more than just business.<br /><br />Overall the film is quite intelligent and quite slick, the scenes where we see Cris consider all possible scenarios before he takes the appropriate action are very well done. The character of Liz really drags down this movie as the relationship seems rushed and simply doesn't work as the character is very much one dimensional anyway. I honestly think Cage shines in this film and action movies are something that I think Cage can actually carry on his shoulders.<br /><br />This is a very good popcorn movie although it did have its flaws there's no doubt it's entertaining and can give you a good night in.dimension that would make us care for her and their relationship.

B000VWYNOG|2.0|This compilation only shows to what degree an artist or music company will go to gouge the consumer for music that is not up to expectations.  This is a wasted purchase. The tracks, while including many unnecessary and unneeded \\"oldies\\" are mixed in with several tracks that try to be too all-encompasing. It misses the mark.  It's not pleasing or easy to follow the logic of the tracks. It doesn't follow by year and it doesn't follow by arranging songs in any listenable sequence.   Look I love Van, but this really doesn't do justice to the man's musical accomplishments.

On more than one occasion the soundtrack has not come up my initial impressions while watching the movie. Not here, though. This is a wonderful compilation of tunes that don't get old with repeated listening. Just a beautiful, very listenable CD.
0805028846|3.0|Nice book with lots of pictures. What it could use in my opinion is an explanation of the more complex or less common pop-up methods. Now I have to figure a lot out myself because it is not in the book.<br /><br />I'm not tatally satisfied with this book and will definately need another one to complete the pop-up book i'm making.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|If you are a fan of the show you want to have this dvd set.  I love the outtakes and extras it makes paying for the set worth it.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|I often read the reviews on Amazon when I am unfamiliar with a product, cd or dvd and I want to get a consensus of how good it is.  I've never felt compelled to write one myself until now.    SPOILER ALERT-stop reading now if you don't want to know the ending!    The Mist was a great movie and followed the book pretty faithfully up until the unbelievably horrible re-working of the ending.  I won't go into much detail about the movie.  Suffice it to say that it was brilliantly shot, acted very well and pretty much looked exactly like I've pictured it since I first read it nearly 20 years ago.  It was such a great job and SK movies are usually pretty bad.    The change on the ending completely alters what the original story was about.  I listened to the commentary and evidently King liked the new ending.  The book version ends with the line \\"The other is hope.\\"   The movie ends with a father shooting his son(to protect him from the monsters) literally minutes before the army drives up to the rescue.  The father lives to no doubt be tortured for the rest of his life by what he's done.    My problem isn't necessarily with what the father does.  It's hinted at in the book that it could come to this, but making him survive is just cruel.  I think seeing his wife's body strung up by giant spiders and having to kill his son would've been plenty to put this guy through.      It's a bad joke and an example of shock for shock's sake.  If there was no written story of this prior to the movie, I'd have been slightly more okay with the ending.  I loved the Departed and No Country For Old Men, two movies where there is no happy ending.  This ending was a complete reworking of one of King's best stories.    The book version is about survival and HOPE.  The human spirit's will to survive and that there is another opportunity tomorrow, however slim the odds.  The movie ends up being about a guy having his existence completely tortured so that a director can have a provocative ending.The book ending would have been a great movie ending.  It certainly wouldn't have been a \\"Hollywood\\" ending.  It's pretty clear that the odds are stacked against them and that survival is a fool's hope at best, but that leaves it up to us to figure what happens... or not.  I've never decided for myself whether or not they survive, but I never thought that they all die minutes before the army arrives.    That's the other thing that the director screwed up.  The army shouldn't arrive at all.  It makes for a better story that this thing that has happened is beyond the capability of an army to fix.  At least during the movie anyway.  Maybe mankind gets the upper hand eventually, but I don't think we need to see it happening.    This director really screwed up an otherwise excellent effort.  What a shame!  I will always consider the book ending to be the real ending.  I don't care what King says as he is much better at writing stories than he is at bringing them to the big screen.    CHEAP SHOT!
0978607651|5.0|I saw a feature of this book on The Sunday Morning Show (CBS) and just had to have it!  It is so bright and beautiful with a wonderful biography of Charley Harper to go along with his wonderful artwork.  How wonderful that Charley got to view a wonderful book chock full of his work before his death.  Kudos to Todd Oldham for honoring such a fun/fine artist.  Be warned, this is a LARGE book and is deserving of a big coffee table or a place of honor.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's truly sad that this series was dropped the way it was. There was so much potential in the great characters and the developing story. Hard to say anything that hasn't already been included in the reviews here. If you like sci-fi, even a little, this series is well worth checking out.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have recently decided that home workouts are the only way I am going to ensure I get a workout in every day, with a toddler and a full time job. Thus, I did a lot of research on good DVDs and some essential \\"props\\" and over the past few months have purchased about 12 DVDs from TaeBo to PIlates to the Biggest Loser series, and then I saw this new one from Jillian, and it surpassed everything else I own by far. I have been working out pretty regularly for over 10 years, I've done triathlon's and everything from spinning to running to kickboxing, so I figured I could start at Level 3. After 3 minutes I went down to Level 2, and then another five minutes to Level 1!!! I have been doing Level 1 for a week and think I will be able to progress a level each week, but it is truly a challenging and rewarding workout, and I highly recommend it for people who enjoy maximum results in minimal time (and don't mind sweating and feel like they might have a heart attack!)
B00005OM4K|5.0|Excelente sonido, no se por que hay alguna queja al respecto. Toda la colección suena espectacular. Totalmente recomendable para los fans de CCR
B00006399Z|3.0|I'm not much of a fan of live recordings as the spontaneity of a live performance is best felt with the interactivity of having been there. However, Traffic must've been fantastic in person. The feeling imparted by this LP is that Traffic was always better with singer/guitarist/composer Dave Mason in their ranks. His tunes benefit greatly from the accompaniment of his erstwhile band members and the auxiliary assemblage of musicians. Better proof of this would be to listen to any mid-70's Dave Mason LP followed by \\"Shootout At The Fantasy Factory\\" by Traffic; one yearns to take the best of both and forge a Traffic album with all of the principals involved. That is the beauty of having CD burning software (for your own personal use, of course).
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Everyone seemed disappointed in this movie (probably because it takes a pretty high attention span to really get into).  Another reviewer commented that it \\"doesn't stick closely to its' source material\\", and in a way this is true, but it in a way it isn't--the film is pretty grim and though the ending strays from the novel, it is not a disappointment.<br /><br />Richard Matheson was so displeased with the first version of his classic horror novel of the same name (\\"The Last Man On Earth\\" starring Vincent Price) that he changed his name on the film's credits to \\"Logan Swanson\\".  One can only imagine what he thought of Charlton Heston's \\"The Omega Man\\", which featured zombies with afros and sunglasses.  Both of these films, however, conveyed the sense of crushing loneliness which comes through in the novel (particularly the former).  I'm not sure it's possible to successfully adopt this book to screen without departing in some way from the author's uncompromising vision.<br /><br />Will Smith does a fantastically understated job as the unfortunate scientist Robert Neville, who seems to be the sole surviving member of the human race after a pernicious virus simultaneously wipes out the species and transforms them into degraded, parasitic creatures not dissimilar to mythological vampires.  Along with his dog Sam, he cruises around during the day and hides in his fortress-like apartment while they roam the streets looking for him.  The tension in this film is palpable enough to cut with a knife; the scene in which Sam unwisely runs into a very dark area, thereby sparking a confrontation between Neville and his once human foes, is nail biting and effective.  Smith brings across the psychical damage wrought by years of solitude and fear when he tearfully begs a mannequin to say hello to him, almost with the glimmer of a belief that it might indeed happen.  In nearly every way it is faithful to some of the most heart-wrenching events of the novel: Sam's transformation, for instance, into a rabid dog and what Neville has to do afterward.<br /><br />The irony of Neville being a feared, monstrous being from the perspective of these creatures and his natural inclinaton to see them the same way is not brought across with as much force as it was in \\"The Last Man\\" but nonetheless it is delivered powerfully.  Smith's Neville \\"donates his blood\\" (no pun intended) while igniting a grenade in a gesture of self-sacrifice that is not candy coated.  In some ways this is one of the best versions of the novel I have ever seen, and kudos to Will Smith for a great performance.a rabid dog and what Neville has to do afterward.

B000059T00|4.0|Blind Faith is hailed as THE \\"supergroup\\" of the era. The performances on this record are excellent and the tunes are certainly above average, especially \\"Can't Find My Way Home\\" and \\"The Presence of The Lord\\". Naturally, one is want to compare this record to anything released by Cream, Traffic or Family. Unfortunately, this record is not greater than the combined value of the aforementioned, but rather an adequate compromise. The players are first-rate, but the LP simply doesn't live-up to the hype that has surrounded it since its release. The band itself fell apart under that weight. Still, this record has more to offer on the basis of the participants than many records by obscure artists. I guess it's all relative to notoriety.
B0001ADB8C|2.0|George Harrison had probably one of the most disappointing Beatle solo careers, especially when you consider just how FABULOUS and AWESOME his debut 3 record set All things Must Pass was.      This compilation unfortunately highlights more of the blandness and flaws of George's solo career by leaving off the Living in the Material World and Extra Texture stuff entirely and starting with the music on his Dark Horse label/era.    Overall there are some very good songs spread throughout all (but Gone Troppo which along with George's Dark Horse LP (not in this set) are one of the worst records in the history of rock and roll). Many of these albums have a few decent songs whose impact gets hidden with all the blandness and repetiiveness that surrounds them.....they just don't have the punch and certainly don't live up to his debut, Brainwashed, his work with the Traveling Wilburies.    I think a proper boxed set should be created.  See below for more details.  Of the albums here, only Cloud Nine has any merit as a full record (it's actually a very decent album, not great, but still in many ways excellent).  His self titled album is decent, but horribly bland, even if the songwriting is a bit back to form, and it's horribly produced.  The rest easily have cherry pick 1 or 2 song moments....    Ultimately I'd like to see a 4 disc George Set that removed a lot of the filler (allow the completists to buy everything, George and really all the solo Beatles aren't worthy of this complete album boxed set treatment--even sadly John--and I'm a freak fan that owns all of his solo stuff sans Unfinished no 3--.      MUCH OF THE first part of the BELOW was copied from my own post on a comment to the Best of George Harrison (the best of that is mostly Beatle tunes).  I felt why not include a full review here though.        I'd like a 4 disc set from George that had the highlights of his career and includes his great Spector demos from before the All Things Sessions.....This set shouldbe sold both in the all 4 disc format, and there should also be a best of the \\"also\\" years set that allows fans to buy the best of his post All Things career--but unfortunately forces megafans to buy the entire set in order to get the Spector Demos disc (although many mega fans--me included--already have the bootlegged copy.  It could also include the \\"dvd\\" this set came with, but hopefully this time with a bit more concert meat....and/or a short documentary that focuses more on his solo career, 1974 tour, and \\"lost period\\" struggles instead of Shanghai surprise.    For this I'd package a 4 disc set: First disc takes the entire first record of ATMP, adds I Dig Love, Hear Me Lord and maybe the 2nd version of Isn't it a Pity (although that's very similar to v1, so only if time allows).    Then I'd have key tracks from his other records fill up the next 2 cd's maybe with a nice demo or two: Give Me Love, Don't Let Me Wait too Long, Try Some Buy Some, Living in the Material World, That is All, Dark Horse, You, This Guitar (Can't Keep From Crying), Here Comes the Moon, The Answers at the End, Can't Stop Thinking About You, Oooh Baby (You KNow I Love You)--A song I'd love to see get covered by a soul artist, Beautiful Girl, Not Guilty, Blow Away, Dark Sweet Lady, All THose Years Ago, When We Was Fab, Cloud 9, Got my Mind Set On You, Crackerbox Palace, Cheer Down, Any Road, Pisces Fish, Marwa Blues--just since it won a grammy and all, Stuck Inside a Cloud, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, Never Get Over You, Traveling Wilburies--Handle With Care, End of the Line, Last Night....    Then I'd fill the 4th disc with the Phil Spector Demos (at least the best of them from All Things Must Pass sessions (I'd also love to hear a less produced version of the great YOU that I don't have) and a series of the best live songs from George's portion of Bangladesh, 1974 tour and live in Japan....    I would leave all of the Beatles stuff off (beside's George's solo live recordingsof Beatles songs) because anyone who bought this set would undoubtably have much if not all the Beatles stuff....    But why oh why did we have to get that Dark Horse Year's boxed set a few year's back that pretty much anthologized and pooled all of the really weak era George?....why too isn't the song Cheer Down and album Extra Texture at least available on iTunes? Extra Texture actually is probably his 3rd best record besides ATMP and Brainwashed....Living in the Material World has its share of very good songs but is just so damn preachy and over the course of the album gets a bit bland even with its individual song highs....the rest of his albums are mostly a bore, but have a few gems amidst them.    A True COMPILATION of George is more than necessary....sell as a full set and also sell the 2 middle discs as an individual set (allowing fans to either buy all in to get the Spector demos) or buy the best of the worst for the Post All Things stuff.    Then after a good boxed set comes out with his mostly released work, let's get a 1-2 cd anthology type of set that focuses more on the songs he recorded that didn't see the light of day....he supposedly has a nice vault of this stuff that I've never seen/heard in bootlegged form.    The songs listed above paint a great picture of George's solo career, one that might make his solo career appear much more substantial than it actually was, and might give George more merit to stand next to Lennon as the best solo Beatle--John had some fabulous songs, and overall made much better, more consistent solo records, but George also had his share of great tunes, unfortunately hidden amongst a series of bland (1-2 star records).  By removing the blandness and focusing on the highs, one can see George's true talents shine.  George is the one Beatle who really should have formed a band after the breakup, he really had a knack for making a great 2-3 songs on each album.....  His albums tend to be so weak that they completely dillute his solo accomplishments (besides the debut and the denouement that is)...    Just my thoughts....I further wouldn't buy this set (I have all the individual albums and I have seen the DVD by renting it at our library) (besides the fact that it'll be a disappointment for all but the mega huge fan) because it's so freaking pricey and there is so little extra material.  At least they could have added 6-7 bonus tracks to each record (instead of the token 1) and made a longer, more detailed DVD.....    I would hardly recommend this as it's presented today.     Quick Individual Album reviews included in this set:  33 & 1/3: 2 stars.  Not bad, not terribly memorable and unlike some of the others doesn't have many really good gems amidst the bore.  This one just doesn't have the low's of the other records, so it maintains a steady below avg mark.    George Harrison: 2.5 stars. Seems like a masterpiece compared to the other tracks on here....but is so shoddilly produced and bland that a lot of its gems get lost.  4-5 great tunes though (See above) the rest is pretty much a bore, but I do kind of like the almost Todd Rundgren esque Love Comes to Everyone (which I may reconsider including in the above).  Still this one is too slick and George's voice isn't stellar enough for the slick backgrounds.  He probably spent 2 weeks making this one (instead of 2 days like many of the others).    Somewhere in England. 1.5 stars \\"All Those Years Ago\\" is really the song giving this the extra .5 stars (one of the best George solo songs).  Hardly memorable.    Gone Troppo: 0.25 stars.  Quite simply the worst Beatle solo record--even beating all those unfinished music musings from John, dated 80's Paul, and RINGO's crud if you can believe that.  THis is dated music to be sure, but there's hardly a good song on here (unless you oddly like Gone Troppo or this sheen version of Circles...I don't and I hate the record).  This guy even beat George's Dark Horse album for his worst record--Dark Horsehad a tune or two on it but remains the worst produced record of his life and the one that really highlights how bad George's voice was during the mid 70s....    Cloud Nine: 4 stars....might be the best Beatle record of the 1980s (although Double Fantasy was quite good).  This one is pretty solid throughout, and Jeff Lynne tinkers but hardly ruins, he actually finds ways to make George seem like a good singer again, which is nice.  Refreshing the album also showed a critical rebirth for George (who would really keep this up with the Wilbury's and Brainwashed, even if he only recorded sporadically thereafter).    Live in Japan: 1.5 stars....on paper this seems like a gem, George and Eric Clapton on the road in Japan with a fabulous track listing....unfortunately all it sounds like is extra slick versions of Beatle songs and solo songs.....extremely disappointing, they seem to go through the motions.  Might have been better to have been there, but this is a terribly unexciting live record (and therefore a failure, since excitment is what people like to hear in live recordings).    The DVD is ok, too short, and not too memorable, but it's at least an extra.
B0000667ES|5.0|Kevin really was a genius...  He treats the face as a canvas, and shows the transformative power of make-up.  These kinds of dramatic makeovers take considerable skill and practice, to be sure, but Kevin always insists that it's not about perfection, but about allowing ourselves to try, to dare to be different.   Great message from a great artist and human being.  This is a fantastic book, both as an art piece and as a makeup book.  I highly recommend it!
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I've seen the film, now I love the music, too. It's already in the family i-pod. I especially liked the part where the dialogue is kept intact (\\"intended for humans\\"). Lovely.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|I highly recommend buying the complete series boxset over each season individually. The packaging for the series is beautiful. It also includes an extra disc not included in any of the dvd sets
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout DVD.  It's very intense and non-stop for twenty minutes.  By the end you'll definitely think that twenty minutes is a long enough workout.  I would start at level one even if you are intermediate or advanced.  Level two kicked my butt and I work out every day.  Each work out is three circuits of 3 minutes strength, two minutes cardio, and one minute abs.  You move up to the next level at your own pace.  There is no time limit for being at any of the levels.  Highly recommend this DVD.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|WOW, what a film. If you like monster movies, you will love this movie. If I continue my review all I will say is how great everything is, so I think I will stop right now so you can buy the DVD and watch it.
0375847227|4.0|This is an absoltely wonderful trilogy that pulls the reader in once you get started. I was eager to read this entire book in one evening and when i happened to be reading the last few chapters, i found myslef slowing down, for I was upset that my great adventure was ending. This story follows the adventures of a young girl called Lyra and all of the places she goes and people she meets, and danger that she encounters, as she searches for this thing called Dust. She really doesn't know what it is and is on a personal mission to find out. Is this Dust the reason why so many children are taken and never seen again? Do the Gobblers and Dust have a link? And Why does this Dust only surround the grown ups? Lyra goes against her father's wishes although she doesn't realize it at first and she also fights against her mother, although she doesn't recognize her mother for who she is in the beginning either. Lyra takes us to meet many new people from all over the world, and from many different worlds as well.<br /><br /> Buying this book in its trilogy format was great for me because I found after one book ended i needed to find out what happened next. I couldn't put it down. This trilogy received 4 stars from me only because I was pulled in after the second or third chapter. Other books have succeeded in grabing me from page one. After the first few chapters however, this book is climax after climax. I highly reccomend this book. Although however I should note this... I'm sure other's reveiws have been read before this, but i want to reiterate that any hardcore Christians would be highly upset at the main subject matter of this book. This is a trilogy to be read by those who have an open mind, or those who can read the work of another who's viewpoint is definately not mainstream, and not get upset. That now out of the way, what are you waiting for, buy this trilogy!!!
B00006I53S|4.0|I really enjoy using Canon prime lenses - have a 20, 35, 50, and 85 so far. But when I need a zoom lens - say for a public event and I can't be jumping around to re-frame - I take this lens.  It takes good shots (I'm an amateur) and the IS really works.    On a cropped digital camera like the Rebel XTi, the 28mm setting isn't a wide-angle.  So if you're going traveling, you will probably want to supplement this (e.g., the Canon 20mm prime which is amazingly good but costs as much as this lens does).
B0001GF2DS|5.0|The third in a trilogy. The Good Bad and Ugly is a sprawling western. Helped to make Clint Eastwood a household name. But, it wouldn't have worked without Eli Wallace.
B000005J56|5.0|If you want to listen to pure fun music, please do buy this CD. It features a plethora of musicians , where the average age is 65, some of the finest in afro-Cuban jazz music, perfectly coordinated, produced and arranged by Ry Cooder to come out with a masterpiece. You have guajiras, boleros etc.. and some of the highlights according to me are Candela, Chan Chan, El Carretero, Dos gardenias sung by Ferrer.<br /><br />Listen to the samples now and if that does not get your feet going, do get back to your indie music and stay there!<br />Once you have listened to this,i would urge you to seek out the albums of the individual artists, notably Compay Segundo and the amazing Ibrahim Ferrer (RIP).
B000JLSLZQ|4.0|Great purchase, I don't regret it at all!  Disc came in a timely fashion, didn't wait too long.  Love the quality of the Bluray!  Blows away standard DVDs by miles.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase and how quickly it arrived at my home, even as I'm living in Hawaii...  A+!
1416524800|2.0|I decided to read this book because I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code.  While Deception Point is a page-turner, it quickly wore on my patience because it was impossible to suspend disbelief long enough to enjoy it.  And of course there was the stereotyping and the minimal character development - a brilliant, beautiful intelligence agent with a high-power career, whose only complication is her narcissistic, power-hungry father?  A brilliant, successful documentary star whose only complication is that he is a grieving widower?<br /><br />Gag me!  NO real humans are ever that uncomplicated!<br /><br />Then I began to understand the real problem with the book - it's more fantasy science fiction than political suspense.<br /><br />I gave it two stars:  one star because Dan Brown's writing style is actually easy to follow.  I gave it the second star because once I replaced Washington, D.C. with \\"Gotham City\\" and the White House with, \\"the Bat Cave,\\" and replaced the characters with Batman, Robin, Catwoman, the Joker, the Riddler, etc., I was able to finish reading the book.<br /><br />Note to aspiring writers of political suspense:  If you don't feel like doing the research or giving the characters any depth, write a comic strip instead!
B000I2J6K0|1.0|I am a pretty fit person (been working out at least 5 days a week, including one day with a trainer, for years), but I think this video contains prenatal exercises that are way too fast and jerky for most pregnant women. If you go at your own pace, it's fine, but following her speed (especially during the \\"double-time\\" parts) is probably too much for most women. You can tell she's a group exercise instructor--I'm sure she's a great teacher in that context. But I don't think the dismissive \\"you're okay, you're fine\\" comments she makes during the more intense parts of the video are necessarily the message to send to a pregnant woman who may be overexerting.
0452284392|5.0|Reminds of \\"The World is Flat\\".  It covers lots of ground really quickly.  It was an interesting subject, something I've speculated a lot on my own and it was reinforcing to have a professional discuss lots of patterns (biology, physics, society, information networks) in a short-form context.  It inspired me to write some graphics code based on the diagrams in the book and for that it was worth reading.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|First the table is set for us. England is in trouble. Spain rules supreme with a vastly superior navy, The Spanish Armada. Phillip of Spain in a fanatical despot. A Catholic obcessed with destroying Elizabeth, the \\"bastard queen\\" who is by the way, Protestant. That alone didn't set her apart. It was her williness to allow her subjects to worship as they wished, a very radical notion at the time. By 1585, Elizabeth is middle-aged & probably not going to marry or have an heir. But she is still a woman & Sir Walter Raleigh comes into her life. He is a privateer, an adventerer, good-looking & cool as hell. He entertains her with stories of the new world which he has visited, claimed & named for her... Virginia. She falls for him & commands he stay. He tires of court life & desires to return to sea. Eventually, he takes up with Elizabeth's favorite Lady-in-waiting, Bess. Sir Walter impregnates & marries her, in that order, apparently. This of course enrages the Queen. Soon however there are more important things to deal with. She had been forced by her advisors to execute her cousin(?) Mary, Queen of Scots,  a Catholic claiming she is the rightful queen. The Spanish Armada is coming with troops to invade England. Elizabeth, looking very butch in her armour,  addreses her troops who are to defend England. But they don't have to.   Shortly, a storm intervenes, destroying the Armada & Phillip's dreams.     The tone of this movie was somewhat lighter than the first. Just the ligther colors & sprit conveyed the idea that Elizabeth had coosolidated her power, which was absolute. Perhaps the best years of her reign. If you like history, you'll  appreciate this effort. However accurate it is much of it is historical fact. Considering we are looking back over 400 years it is really excellent. Forget that it is history, if you must. It is still a pretty good story.
0385338724|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It's a nice light read, which is always nice once and a while, but it's also funny and witty.  I've read all her books, and in my opinion, this it the best stand alone book to date.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|The transfers are spectacular, and there's more versions of the movie included than you may ever decide to watch. Comes with a small plastic replica of the origami unicorn, and a toy version of Deckard's flying car. Also a lenticular image and a folder with pictures and notes.     If you've got room on your shelf, it's a must-have for film geeks.
1401216676|2.0|The hardcover is not the The Killing Joke as originally presented to comic readers.  For the original, you must buy the original GN one-shot, or DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore (Paperback) which reprints the original, as it was originally.      It should be noted before buying the KJ Hardcover that:    1) Brian Bolland radically recolored the entire story  2) Batman's yellow oval is removed from the entire story (even though the story still takes place during Batman's \\"yellow oval\\" period)  3) there is a subtle change to the cover; instead of just having the word balloon saying the word `Smile' with no punctuation, it now reads `Smile!'
B000GW88UG|5.0|As my title suggests this album is definitely not for everybody. This is an album looking at the darker side of love, not found in romantic teenage girl books or fluffy movies. Apart from the lyrics which are based in looking at life through neurosis BUT in some respects ALL true. from the non-committal collective in \\"Death of a Disco Dancer\\" to the references of suicidal behaviour (too many songs to mention), to the moody and loveless \\"Last night I dreamt that somebody loved me\\" (listen to the music in this track, FANTASTIC), THE SMITHS brought something else to music in that era. The guitar riffs, Morrissey, the different views, the wit...
B000003TAB|5.0|Have you worn out the grooves of your NEVERMIND CD? Do you recite MTV UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK in your sleep? Then it's time to take a look at INCESTICIDE if you still haven't. True, this collection of out-takes and B-sides doesn't quite measure up to one of their \\"official\\" albums, but it's still Nirvana - and \\"pretty good\\" Nirvana is still way better than the best stuff from most of their imitators. INCESTICIDE shows you different sides of Nirvana - including a warped sense of humor.<br />Most of this record rocks really hard. That's certainly true of the Meat Puppets nod \\"Son of a Gun,\\" and the old school stomp of \\"Aero Zeppelin.\\" \\"Dive\\" is one of the best and kinda freaky the way Kurt sounds as if he's screaming \\"Die with me!\\" instead of \\"Dive with me!\\" Kurt really conveyed a lot not only with his lyrics but also his tortured guitar. His guitar was expressive, anguished and cutting and that's apparent on this album.<br /><br />You can definitely get your Nirvana on here. Blows away most bands who were influenced by \\"grunge\\" (to use the media-generated label). That's not to say that there aren't tons of great bands out there who were influenced by Nirvana. But there's only one Nirvana.
B0015KO52S|1.0|Clearly and obviously from the cover art of this record, here is another attempt from Jack White trying to emulate and rip off the aesthetic already done by Billy Childish's pen hole camera ' old timey' photos for his albums  with his much rawer former rock combo The Buff Medways. Jack White's 'safe' radio friendly, overly produced predictable blues-rock-garage has been done much better with more rock and roll grit in the 80's by Billy Childish, Thee Mummies, Gun Club, [...] Galore etc, etc and especially in the 90's with Honeymoon Killers, JSBX, the Gories, the Gibson Brothers, the Oblivians, etc, etc, etc.    Save your money, do not buy yuppie music that emulates true raw punk rock and roll such as this Rank band
B000HIVOI2|5.0|I have the original Stargate on DVD, but had to get the High Def version. Wow!  Am I glad that I did.  It is crystal clear even on my 80\\" screen. Now that is a true test of a High Def DVD. It is spectacular. More than worth buying a second copy if you already have it in DVD. If not, then get it. Great movie, awesome music and a premise that has really come into being now that the 20 year Human Genome project has proven scientifically once and for all that we are not decendants of primates. Basically there is no possible genetic link between human beings & primates.  Leaving only 2 possibilities of how we got here. Either God's creation or genes from aliens, hence, Stargate.
B00132D808|5.0|i preorderd fever and got it early, didnt really listen to it to much. maybe 4 - 5 times fully from 2005 - 2007 then at the end of summer 2007 i saw two live videos from the reading festival: middle of summer and back to the streets which both have changed there names and the songs themselves a bit, middle of summer (when the day met the night) wasnt that great before they fixed it up the chorus only said in the middle of summer and thats it nothing else.     well after hearing those two songs and loving them i poped out my fevers cd and gave it more of a chance and really really fell in love with it i even bought the special limited edition of fever which was a good choice, that package will get you really into patd. so that whole time i was dying to hear the new album, and now its finally here and its even better than the first cd which i didnt think was possible after falling in love with it, the cd might not be amazing at first or even good to some of you close minded people but it will grow on you, it didnt take much for me to fall in love with it.    please dont not buy this cd cause you see kids saying that it sucks, and dont let that get to your head, give it your own listen and take it in listen a few times. put it on your ipod or mp3 player and sit outside and enjoy it, it really goes well outside with the lyrics about the sun and the moon.
B00133KFGW|2.0|This movie was soooo slow, and predictable I could have fallen asleep after the first 10 minutes, woken up during the last 5, and not missed a thing!  It consists of a young boy, wandering around looking for his parents, meeting people who's characters are never developed, staring wide eyed at everything he comes across, then finding his parents.  On the way we learn he is a musical prodigy, which provides the only redeeming quality of the film, the music.    It is basically just a waste of time, but the music is good.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Genius art direction. There are few films that rank with Queen Margot and Merchant & Ivory's best known works from the late '80s/early '90s... but this is one of them. Thoroughout the film there lies a tangible tension between its morose storyline and its intoxicating beauty.    Perfume is, and arguably always has been, inextricably linked to fashion, and the entire film could easily be an ad for Chanel. It seamlessly combines dirt with satin and the result is a successful feat above all odds - doing what others thought impossible and truly bringing the pages of Perfume to the screen.    (No - it's not for everyone, but in case you didn't guess I loved it.)
B00132D808|3.0|Panic's new album is waaaay different than A Fever You Can't Sweat out. That album was fast paced and crazy, and awesome! This one is sort of slow paced, but still awesome in it's own way. Panic need to listen to their fans when we say your next album should be like A Fever You Cant Sweat Out and not like Pretty Odd. It's still good though. Here's the songs and what I give them with 5 being the highest:    01 - We're So Starving                           3/5  02 - Nine In The Afternoon                       4/5  03 - She's a Handsome Woman                      5/5  04 - Do You Know What I'm Seeing                 3/5  05 - That Green Gentleman                        4/5  06 - I Have Friends In Holy Spaces               3/5  07 - Northern Downpour                           4/5  08 - When The Day Met The Night                  4/5  09 - Pas De Cheval                               2/5  10- The Piano Knows Something I Don't Know       4.5/5  11 - Behind the Sea                              4/5  12 - Folkin' Around                              2/5  13 - She Had The World                           4/5  14 - From A Mountain In The Middle Of The Cabins 4/5  15 - Mad As Rabbits                              2/5    The best on the album is She's a Handsome Woman in my opinion, but also I cant stop listening to tracks 10, 11, and 14. I'd rate the cd a 4/5, but their old one, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, gets a 5/5. It's unbeatable.
0143038419|1.0|Wow-except for the food descriptions, this book was a HUGE waste of reading time!  What a self-centered person!  What EXACTLY was so wrong with her husband?  Also, picking and choosing from different world religions seemed to only make her weirder!  If I saw this woman on the steet, I'd run like crazy the other way!!
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I believe that for the generation this film was made for (no attention span, gore-expecting, Depp fans) this was an amazing film.  Johnny Depp and H.B. Carter do a great job stepping up to the plate as singers (don't forget Alan Rickman either!).  Obviously a Tim Burton film, dark, with covert humor and oddly bright blood that makes you realize this is an absurd tale about absurd people.  If you went into the theaters looking to see Jessica Fletcher prancing around again, you really should have looked at the movie poster - that's all it took to see what type of movie it was and what generation it was geared toward.  As I sais in the title, Well Done!
B0012EM5D8|1.0|I do not understand why such great talents such as Jerry S. and Renee Z. would waste their time with such a horrible movie. I usually like all of the animated movies but this is awful
630588255X|2.0|there's about 10 minutes of written content in this film, the rest is filling in space. do we need to see 15 seconds of the policeman getting off his motorbike, putting the kickstand down, and walking over to the car? the way it's edited seems like they struggled to reach feature length. as for what content there is, in terms of drama the characters and plot are relatively underdeveloped and in terms of comedy what may have been original in 1971 seems cliched today.
1594489505|5.0|This is one of the most moving books I have ever read. It made me weep, lots. It made me furiously angry. It is one of the first books that has made me hate. There were times when I felt that I could not cope, myself, with one more tragedy, that this author was merciless, but he gave us respite near the end, and turned my rage to gentle yet lachrymose sorrow and a feeling of beauty and triumph in the closing stages.   It is a book filled with horror, and yet it is one that ends with the wounds salved but not dismissed. It is a book that inspires one to want to do something to assist, and it is a book that has helped me to understand Afghanistan and the position of the refugees there.  I only finished it an hour or so ago, but I cannot concentrate on anything else. Its words and images are coursing through my body; their resonance will last a long time.  I have never before been made to feel so keenly the hopeless plight of women in these repressive regimes, never before felt their inequality so strongly, and never before been placed in the shoes of someone treated as a thing, a possession, by someone else - especially when that someone is a despicable brute. I have never before bothered to consider what it must be like to be born out of wedlock in a place where that matters.   I have always known of the senselessness of war, and of its horror, and yet these emotions, too, were felt with a new intensity and reality. I really lived through this war as new \\"friends\\" died. I also was made to realise in a new way the manner in which violence becomes excessive, escalatory, addictive to its perpetrators, in a reaction similar to that of a dog who has tasted the flesh of a living victim.   And why do I feel all this? Because of the immediacy of the tale, the excellence of the characterisation, the verisimilitude of the descriptions and the emotions Hosseini stirs. Khaled Hosseini has told his tale superbly and brought the horrors of his country's war into our homes. The ending shows us, however, that his purpose is not just to horrify us, but to work through that horror to make us aware of the plight of our fellow humans. And we do not walk away with horror as the predominant emotion. Like true classical tragedy, this book leaves us with many positive emotions - the feeling of respect and wonder at the indomitable human spirit of Laila, honour for Mariam and the sacrifice makes, and hope for a future that can be shaped by people such as Tariq and his family.
0671027344|5.0|This book is one of the best books I personally have ever read, not because of the authors ample use of literary devices, or because of his complex underlying symbolism which takes many hours of careful thought to understand; it is becuase of the straightforwardness of the narrator and the way he can relate to the reader (or specificly me in my case) without having to cover the meaning of the novel up with elaborate style or symbolism. The character of the narrator is enough to allow the reader to understand him, care about him, and eventually love him. The emotional bond that is formed during this novel is second to none.
0140449337|5.0|I reread Marcus Aurelius' Meditations every five years or so, and each time I do I'm struck by the sheer pathos of the book.  Here's the most powerful man in the world (of his day), the emperor Marcus Aurelius, absolute sovereign of the western world, a ruler who held the power of life and death over millions of subjects, and moreover a man steeped in philosophy and wisdom traditions--who confronts his own mortality and realizes that even he must die.  The Meditations is Marcus' soul-searching, occasionally disingenuous, usually calm but sometimes panicky panicky effort to come to grips with that sobering fact.  If life is ephemeral, even for the world's most powerful man, how should that life be lived?<br /><br />It's this intensely human need to figure out what life is about before the inevitable night closes in that makes Marcus' journals so intensely interesting and valuable to the rest of us.  His answers, coming from the philosophical tradition of Stoicism, aren't for everyone.  My guess is that readers with a few years on them will find stoicism more attractive than younger readers who are full of oats and hormones.  Marcus argues that that a happy life is one lived in accordance with nature; that living in accordance with nature means cultivating a \\"just\\" or rational mind and virtuous behavior that accord with the rationality of creation; that humans are interconnected both with nature and one another, such that no person who tries to deny the connection can live happily or healthily; and that human freedom and happiness is proportionate to the cultivation of apatheia or indifference to those matters over which we have no control (very much like the wisdom expressed in the Buddha's Four Noble Truths).<br /><br />Ultimately, each person must face death alone, as best he or she can.  But if Marcus's Meditations offer much food for thought, not only about the mortality which we all carry but also about the good life for which we all yearn.
0694003611|5.0|My girls want me to  read this book to them over and over again. They have a ton of books but they always pick this book to read before bed. Sometime I have to read this book 3 or 4 times in a row before they get enough of it.
B00102F5WK|5.0|It's a great shame that this movie did not get the audience it deserved. Every American should watch it. Yes, it's a movie, so yes, it's melodramatic.  And yes, dear Bushies, some of these practices started before 9/11, but certainly George W has taken it to the limits. This is a beautiful, thoughtful, provocative film -- watch it! Then think about where we are going as Americans.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|I'd been wanting to see this for a long time, it never got released in cinemas here due to it being cut in half instead of being screened along with Planet Terror in Australia as it was supposed to. finally it's arrived on DVD here, and it was not what I expected it was going to be.     Kurt Russel plays Stunt Man Mike, a guy who has issues. His character and motivation are not explained as to why the hell he does what he does, but I guess thats probably what they where going for in this.    It's quality is bad, but done on purpose, it's supposed to give the feel of how drive in movies where in the 70's, tho it kinda gets a bit annoying after a while, but more with Planet Terror.     The opening scene is a bit too long, i found myself almost nodding off while 3 chicks go on and on about useless things in there lives that have no tie in to the plot whatsoever. However, by the time there death scene comes, you are happy to see the annoying ego driven chick, the younger looking Angelina Joeline wanna-be and there quieter spethshall friends taken out.    Stunt Man Mikes kind of stalks them, then makes friends with them in a bar, offers someone a lift home, and the 5 hideous girls lives are in the hands of Mike's \\"death proof\\" car. Death Proof meaning the car is a stunt car, rigged for movies, so if it crashes, the driver will be safe. Which Kurt Russel's character utilizes on.    It almost feels like it could have been a half hour TV show, as now two useless cops into play just to waste up some screen time, then Mike heals up, and he's at it again, only this time what goes around, comes around.    Overall, the whole thing is watchable, it's ok, but it's not fantastic. The first half of the movie is shot for the 70's drive in look, then stalk #2 is clear.     The thing that made it odd to me was it looked and sounded like it was supposed to be in the 70's, but it was present day due to unneeded and useless scenes involving text messaging by cell phones.   IMO none of those things where needed and should have been cut out, and kept it like it was supposed to be set in the 70's.     The second act, left me thinking three words... WTF?  Was the cheerleader and behind the counter sales of a fashion magazine needed, or supposed to be funny, I dunno... I think they just had a 30 minute movie and stretched it out as much as they could with useless scenes of dialog that go for too long and have absolutely nothing to do with the movie. However the end chase scene is pretty entertaining, it's good to see a non CGI car chase on film again that gets the excitement pumping as you watch.    It's watchable, but not something i would buy or copy, so I'd recommend renting it overall if you are curious.
0143038583|5.0|It's changed the way I buy and eat food... for the better.  Very enlightening... Incisive, witty, full of insights about why we eat the way we do and what we can do to help us have a better understanding of what we eat and how we can eat better.
0452289963|5.0|I am usually extremely cynical and skeptical when it comes to \\"self help\\" books.  However, this book \\"explains\\" what is going on within a human being, rather than a myriad of ways of \\"how to fix\\".  This book confirmed for me what I have always suspected, but could never quite explain or put my finger on.  This book provided me the explanation(s)I have always sought.  I always suspected life was never intended to be as complex, difficult, etc. as it appears to be.  I urge anyone and everyone to read this book.
B000002NG7|5.0|This album is fantastic, and although 'Angel Dust' is the fan favorite for most, I would argue this one may just top it.  An engaging album, with highly-skilled musicianship and unpredictable but satisfying song structures.  In my opinion, by making this their last record they did go out on top.  It leaves you wanting more, without a doubt. The extremely good rock songs \\"last Cup of Sorrow' and 'Ashes to Ashes' stand out, but every song seems to deserve its place on the record and fills its slot perfectly.  To get a rock n roll fix without the mundane, routine sounds of more mainstream bands, this album truly satisfies the craving.  Repeatedly.  Bravo, FNM, and thank you.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|Great movie, great packaging, great features!--<br /><br />Wonderful even for someone who's NOT a hardcore fan! (like me)
6303471714|4.0|I work out 4-5 days/week and consider myself at an advanced level. I frequently change my workouts from yoga to running to weighlifting to cardio in order to avoid bordem and fitness plateaus. I had bought the Next Challenge Workout when I was in highschool about 15 years ago so I was pretty excited about getting Cindy's original tape. I think this workout is pretty challenging and I felt sore the next day. I think the repetation and the fast pace is great for increasing heart rate and building muscle without bulk. Unfortunately, Cindy and Radu have sacrificed proper form for a fast pace. I had trouble keeping up with Radu's count and not because of muscle fatigue. I think its impossible to do some of the moves correctly at the pace that he was counting. That is evidenced by the fact that while Cindy keeps pace with Radu's count, she has very poor form in some of the exercises (esp the abs workout).     Anyway, I would not recommend this to anyone but an advanced athlete who already knows proper form. Also, should you get this tape, I would encourage you to go at your own pace. Instead of 20 sit-ups, do 16 but with correct form. Other then this, the tape is very well made, the scenary (including Cindy :) is beautiful and inspiring. Finally, I highly recommend the Next Challenge tape, which has a manageable pace but is super challenging (much more challenging then this tape).
B000YKG5L4|4.0|This CD was consistent and good.  No song is 5 stars except Apol., but all the tracks were good, unlike many CDs where only a few songs are worth listening too more than once or twice.
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this film. So many of the comedies are very silly, almost juvenile. We saw it first in the theater. Many of the movie goers with us had a good laugh too. I also purchased this on DVD and look forward to enjoying this film over & over in the future.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|The special effects, visual and audio of this movie look great. Acting is good like always, except of course the new IOA guy as usual. The bad is they pretty much summed up years and years of storylines with an easy scape goat and they included the 2 worst ideas that Stargate has ever seen, Replicators and the IOA. But hey its Stargate, what did you expect. Still can't wait til the next movie.
B0013NS6EU|5.0|Don't be fooled by the cartoon-like cover, Mr. Roam presents a well thought out system for \\"visual thinking\\" that doesn't exist elsewhere, or is at least hard to find.<br /><br />This is one of those books that should be a standard part of every business travel's carry-on luggage because like any new language it takes work to master, but I believe that it will not only lead to more effective communications, it will also lead to clearer thinking by anyone dealing with complex problems involving managing and coordinating people to accomplish important goals.<br /><br />Be a hero - buy several, keep one for yourself and give the others to friends and colleagues.  They'll not only thank you, but you'll be able to improve your own visual thinking and communications skills because you'll be developing your new skills with colleagues on real problems.  That's what my firm is doing - we're expecting over 100 copies to present to clients and business partners!
B000YIGNKE|3.0|While there are some flaws with this film - most notably the running all over Bath by Miss Ann Elliot - I'm still glad I own it.  I have almost always found something redeeming in every adaptation of Austen's novels, and in this one, in particular, it is the character of Capt Wentworth.  As handsome a fellow as I could ever want.  There are excellent scenes as well, such as Wentworth accompanying the carriage on horseback as they traveled to Lyme, and I enjoyed Anne communicating her thoughts to the audience by writing in her diary.      It's Austen, not perfectly done, but well enough to make me pleased to own a copy of this movie.
B000O76TAE|5.0|Wonderful film.  Amazing storyline, although a smidge far fetched, is believable.  Prepare for an emotional roller-coaster ride and to be immersed in the film.... you just about feel like you're right along side Chuck Noland and Wilson.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|\\"The Ark of Truth\\" can best be described as Reckoning Parts 1&2 + Threads (both Season 8)= The Ark of Truth. Although not entirely original in its concept it is orignal in its twists. In \\"Reckoning\\" the Replicators all but destroy the Goauld System Lords and the humans destroy the Replicators, the IOA build on the idea that if the Replicators can destroy the Ori, just as they did the Goauld, then Earth can contain or destroy the replicators. Just as always, the IOA is wrong, the Replicators can not be controlled or contained for very long. Add this to \\"Threads\\", the concept that one Ancient can step in and battle another ascended being to stop them. Oma Desala battles Anubis, stopping him from reforming his armies - Nearly the same happens in this film, ending the Ori threat. I don't want to give away too much, but this movie is worth watching and adding to your collection, because in life, as in art, history DOES repeat itself, and in the Stargate Universe its always fun to watch it repeat.
B000Q6GXW2|3.0|Didn't work at all on XBOX360's HD-DVD player. Had to exchange it for none combo one guy at work had. None combo DVD worked fine looks great. Combo one works fine in coworkers stand alone HD-DVD player. So if you aren't using 360, purchase away. I just don't recommend if you are gonna use the 360. After researching, have heard that combo disks are hit or miss on playing on the 360. Some do some don't.<br /><br />--EDIT I hear MS is releasing a new update to help with this compatiblity, will check again to see if they fixed this. Great movie.
B00122M2QU|5.0|I knew this album was a must-buy the moment that it was announced that the Cavalera brothers would be working together again! The album meets my high expectations and more. Solid from beginning to end, they pour their hearts into this release. Pummeling, brutal metal that keeps you wanting more... Highly recommended.
B000ICM5VW|2.0|2 stars.<br />1 Star cause it worked<br />1 Star cause I liked the movie before I bought this<br /><br />-3 Stars because it is SOOO sharp and picture is so clear. You can always tell Kong is CGI when in a scene with a live actor. I just wouldn't recommend anyone buy the HD or Blueray version of this. However the Dino vs Kong Scene is freaking awesome.
B00133KFGW|2.0|August Rush is a heart-warming, albeit painfully slow at times, story of an orphan boy - a pseudo-Oliver Twist - named Evan Tayler who is the definition of a socially awkward child.  While walking around the streets of New York he meets a wise talking, Boondocks-esque musical prodigy named Arthur who leads him to a group of other musical prodigies.  Evan is escaping from the life of social custody, and following the music in his ears has led him to this unlikely family of vagrant musicians, each with their own speciality (I think I saw a didgeradoo at one point).<br /><br />These kids are living in an abandoned playhouse, and under the tutelage of a ghetto pied piper named Wizard (Robin Williams) who musically pimps all of the gifted youngsters under his watch.  And, wouldn't you know it, young Evan is a friggin guitar genius; so, he fits in quite well.  In no time at all he usurps Arthur for the Alpha position in the drifter family, and the prefered musical prostitute bringing in cash to Wizard - the musical, philosophical pimp who will do anything to keep his new found meal ticket.<br /><br />(Yes, you read all of that right, and it's just as ridiculously unbelieveable as I have mentioned.  It's \\"Ben Affleck saving the world in Armaggedon\\"-ridiculous.)<br /><br />Meanwhile, we find out that Lila and Louis, both socially awkward musicians in their twenties, meet randomly one night at a lame party.  Louis is a guitarist for a somewhat popular band, and he doesn't seem to like crowds.  Yeah, a guitarist who doesn't like crowds.  Lila plays classical music, and the two have a incredibly pointless, random night together - sort of a poor man's Serendipity - and then they part ways the next morning.<br /><br />Oops, he knocked her up.  Nevermind, it didn't happen.  Oh wait, yeah it did, but the father forged her signature up and gave the baby up for adoption.  (I only put it this way because this is the manner in which the movie gave these facts to the viewer)<br /><br />In the end, Lila and Louis discover that Evan is their kid, and he is now a successful composer named August Rush who has attended Juilliard and is about to have his own symphony in Central Park...at eleven years old...where his mother just happens to be playing the cello after an 11-year hiatus...and the father just happens to be driving by after playing a gig during his recent refound love of music.  The entire ordeal is done with more foreshadowing and preposterousness than Dolly Parton walking around the corner.  Amongst all the barely connected storylines, they are all reunited happily ever after...despite the eleven year separation.<br /><br />It's a feel-good movie great for the whole family, and by feel-good I mean completely unbelievable. And by completely unbelievable, I mean there's more realism in Starship Troopers.t Evan is their kid, and he is now a successful composer named August Rush who has attended Juilliard and is about to have his own symphony in Central Park...at eleven years old...where his mother just happens to be playing the cello after an 11-year hiatus...and the father just happens to be driving by after playing a gig during his recent refound love of music.

B0010X8NF0|5.0|Prior to purchasing this movie by Wes Anderson I viewed it in a local theater.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and watched anxiously for it to be available for pre-order. If you have seen and enjoyed Wes Anderson's previous films you will probably enjoy this one.  It holds the same type of comedy as you would find in Royal Tenenbaums  or The Life Aquatic.  Each character has his or her unique quirks that add to the hilarity of the film.  However, this type of comedy is not for everyone.  While I enjoyed it enough to own it some of my friends found it less than entertaining.
B0015T7Q98|3.0|Panic at the Disco still has talent, but this CD is unlike the style that they were known and loved for. It is not full of energy, dancable, or exciting. They are like a completely different band now. I like the old better, and I am pretty disappointed; I looked forward to this release for a long time only to find that it is not anything like what I expected.
0765357151|1.0|I wouldn't waste my time with this novel.  Its' unrealistic portrayal of the protaganist is odd even for the realm of Science Fiction.  Neville's bizarre fits of sexual lust and his awful decision making leave you shaking your head.  His situational awareness is like that of a chicken.  Who acts this way??  He's a ridiculous person who has been given a chance no one else has, and he blows it.  The scientific jargon is silly and dated to the extreme.  You don't care for him at all, and if that is the point, what a waste of time.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Simply fantastic.  Now be warned, much of \\"Consolers\\" is not as immediately accessible as their first album.  It took about 2 listens per track for me to \\"get\\" each song.  But it was well worth the effort.  This is a modern rock gem and certainly a masterpiece when compared with anything else coming out today, from the Foo Fighters to Paramore.  Buy this right away!
B0001WGIBW|5.0|This was a great expansion set for a good price. It has a good selection of track pieces and BRIO is a terrific brand.  The item was shipped very quickly.
B00007GZR5|3.0|I agree with others that movie is visually stunning, but it is way off-base from Richard Matheson's book (which I enjoyed very much). It has been glossed over with a Hollywood happy ending which was a huge disappointment. Some of the scenes were borderline cartoon-y and unnecessary to the story (especially where the kids died first, sending Ann into her downward spiral). Annabella Sciorra was amazing though, she was happy, smart, sad and tortured, sometimes at the same time. Her performance was just enough to keep me interested until the end, but for the most part I still have a bad taste in my mouth.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a great movie!!  The case was fine and shipping was very quick.
B00005QDW5|5.0|An essential collection for Pink Floyd lovers-though Pink Floyd lovers probably already have all of these songs in other places!
1855384396|5.0|My wife told me about this book almost 5 years ago and I just recently finally got around to reading it.  This book has really changed my life.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|If you watch the various extras included on this DVD you will hear the writers and others responsible for the movie, say that they never got the original story.  They did not understand it.  They also seemed to have missed a lot of it's detail.  It would appear that all they really got of the original story is that Beowulf kills a bunch of monsters.  The result is a movie that is not really based on the book outside of some names and dead monsters.    Hrothgar is menaced by a monster named Grendel.  Beowulf shows up to kill it.  He then confronts Grendel's mother (nameless in this version) and finally a dragon.  This all accomplished through a cgi-enhanced cast of very talented actors.  That is the film's best selling point.  There is excellent acting in this film even if the story is pretty thin.  The extras provide a very good look into the thoughts and ideas that made this movie.    Many people have know this story to some degree thanks to the school systems.  The main thing people remember is that Beowulf holds onto Grendel's arm until the arm is torn off.  This is not in this movie.  Yes, Grendel loses an arm but not in the classic heroic manner, it is much more common and mundane.  But when it is all said and done this is a visually beautiful film powered by superior acting skills, I only wish the writing was on the same level.  Check it out.
1577314808|5.0|On one of the online forums to which I belong, whenever anyone asks for book recommendations to help them with personal development, spiritual growth, becoming more intuitive, meditation, relationships or the Law of Attraction, the first book recommended and endorsed over and over again, is Eckhart Tolle's The Power Of Now. This book has clearly had a profound and powerful effect on many people's lives, including my own.    Like Tolle himself, this is a quiet book. And it is in this quietness, in the spaces between the words, that the book's power becomes apparent.  The book gently and lovingly, yet firmly, deconstructs our egoic minds and allows us to experience the pure spiritual presence that lies behind the identities created by our egos. Letting go of the incessant chatter of our analytical minds, and living in The Now, is far from being an empty and boring place to be (as many people starting out on this journey imagine). Instead it is a rich and fulfilling experience, full of intense joy and peace. It can be quite overwhelming the first few times you experience this - I dipped in and out when I started, each time increasing the length of time for which I was able to sustain such presence.     The concepts Tolle discusses are both profound, yet simple, but it can be a challenging process to implement. Our egoic minds are strong and they do not give up their hold on us easily! But, the more you practice the principles, the easier it does get. It is worth persevering - the rewards for doing so are enormous. For example:  * Going about daily life with a strong background hum of joy and peace is infinitely preferable to one of anxiety and stress. And this is noticeable to others as well - people have often said things to me like \\"I enjoy being around you, you have good vibes\\".  * You are able to focus on tasks before you with much more clarity. The full strength of your mind is brought to bear on your work (and play!) as it is no longer cluttered with unrelated issues.  * You feel alive and your health usually improves. You glow with vitality. Tolle himself is one of the best examples of practicing his own teachings - he looks about 40 years old, but is actually in his early 60s!  * Your life circumstances change to reflect the abundance of love, joy and peace to which you are connected. Life flows more smoothly, problems seemingly disappear, and new and exciting experiences and things are drawn to you.
B000852GIQ|5.0|i fell in love with les retrouvailles with the first time i've heard La Veilee.Real touching melody, complexity in feelings simplicity at the music side as a Tiersen classic. I got the limited edition with the DVD box.In the DVD we can see how Tiersen is creating his music, it is all about the whole recording cycle of the album. And for the audiophiles and real Tiersen fans, DVD gives the chance to see the partitions for guitar, violin, xylophone and toy piano like how he is combining the separete recordings. And for finally who loves details, he is listening to Cocteau Twins album where we can see for few seconds. Well i guess i have rambled a bit, to sum up this album is Tiersen's one of the greatest works and i can^'t finish without saying a word about Elizabeth Fraser's amazing and unique voice.
B00110K62U|5.0|This is a wonderful product. It has two DVDs one with the show, which is really beautiful, and the other one with a documentary on how the show was made. I recommend this edition of Les Miserables.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is hands down the best workout DVD I have ever done, and I own several.  I have only done this workout a few times but already I feel the difference.  The workouts are only 20 minutes each so although they are super tough you know that you are almost done so you can push through it!  It consists of a lot of jumping, so prepare for sore calves!  Jillian in incredibly motivating.  Also, I am not a super fit person.  I only started working out a few months ago and I can just barely do level 1 so it is definitely beginner-friendly.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
B0016K74YI|5.0|While this title was Jane Austen's second published work, it is her most popular.  First published in the late 18th century under the title \\"First Impressions\\", it was later revised and re-published under the current name.<br /><br />It is an entertaining view into 18-19th century courtship.  Recommended for students and literature aficionados alike.
B000005JA8|5.0|No one with ears is prepared for the cacaphonics that Mr. Van Vliet has crafted for you here. This album sounds something like Romper Room with a bad attitude.  Imagine the position these talented, but mostly inexperienced musicians were put in -- trapped in a run-down hovel for nine months, with a megalomaniac artist, trying to interpret 'compositions' transcribed from some sketchy piano sessions with a composer that refused to practice with the band.     When I first read about this album 25 years ago, I thought it sounded right up my alley.  After hearing it very many times, I must say, I scratched my head until there was a hole.    Fortunately, a friend of mine at the time made me a tape of other material (check out Clear Spot, or Safe As Milk) from the span of his career, and upon returning to Troutmask, somehow, it all made sense. (But under no circumstances buy 'Unconditionally Guaranteed' or 'Blue Jeans & Moon Beams')    An amazing piece of art which can also be used to chase women out of your life.  Just ask my two ex-wives.
B0016K758S|5.0|In the classic style of early 20th century German language literature, Hesse takes on a deep look at self discovery.  This English translation is useful for students and literature buffs alike.  From Wikipedia:  \\"Siddhartha is an allegorical novel by Hermann Hesse which deals with the spiritual journey of an Indian man called Siddhartha during the time of the Buddha.<br /><br />The book, Hesse's ninth novel, was written in German, in a simple, yet powerful and lyrical style. It was first published in 1922, after Hesse had spent some time in India in the 1910s. It was published in the U.S. in 1951 and became influential during the 1960s.<br /><br />\\"Siddhartha\\" means \\"he who has attained his goals\\" or \\"every wish fulfilled\\".[1] The Buddha's name, before his renunciation, was Prince Siddhartha Gautama, later the Buddha. The main character of Siddhartha in the book is not the same person as the Buddha, who in the book goes by the name \\"Gotama\\".<br /><br />Experience is the aggregate of conscious events experienced by a human in life - it connotes participation, learning and perhaps knowledge. Understanding is comprehension and internalization. In Hesse's novel Siddhartha, experience is shown as the best way to approach understanding of reality and attain enlightenment - Hesse's crafting of Siddhartha's journey shows that understanding is attained not through scholastic, mind-dependent methods, nor through immersing oneself in the carnal pleasures of the world and the accompanying pain of samsara; however, it is the totality of these experiences that allow Siddhartha to attain understanding.\\"
B00003BDXG|4.0|What I love the most about NBK isn't the cast.  I believe that too often, people see the cast and are disappointed in the movie.  What really hooked me was the visuals of the film.  It isn't like every other film, and when Quentin Tarantino's well runs dry, I'd love to see his version of the film.  I really liked the varying camera shots and the animation.  It does have kind of a music video feel to it.  I also love the fact that something is ALWAYS going on, and it holds my attention, which is a good thing, seeing that I get tired of movies easily.  I'm not necessarily the biggest fan of what American society has become over time, and truly appreciate the point of the movie that it tries to drive home.  This film is a little cerebral, and may take more than one session to appreciate the film.  It is definitely a love/hate film.  Me personally, I love it.  To the NBK haters out there, definitely give the film another try.  I didn't really like Fear and Loathing when I first saw it, but I LOVE that movie.  If you nitpick every part of the film, you have ruined it for yourself, because now there's nothing to enjoy about it, because it has been roughly criticized.  Just sit back and enjoy the film.  If you're into conventional film, and you want to see a dime a dozen picture, you have come to the wrong place.  Sure it's a blood bath, but what's to be expected from a film called Natural Born Killers?
B000Y7U98W|4.0|If you liked 28 days later you will like this movie.  The cast does a great job of setting the mood and none of it feels lame or B-movie-esque.  The special effects are top notch and you will be amazed to see what Blu-ray does with it.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle has written one of the most defining books about 'human spiritual awakening' ever. I must say I'm enthralled with it, and have had many many 'aha' moments. Wonderful read for anyone old enough to understand. I HIGHLY recommend this book.
B00132D808|5.0|I was worried about this album...I had heard so many cries of a third rate, wannabee-Beatles rip off, but instead I got an inspired, well written album. (Although the boys seem to have a strange fascination with the sun and the moon...) I really dig all of the orchestral and horn elements. It's a very pleasant surprise and I would reccomend it to all...even if you didn't like their first album.
B00005MP58|4.0|I purchased this movie for my wife's birthday and she completely enjoyed it. She asked for this version over the newest one.
B000X5KSWM|4.0|but how can you not as it would be a rare person who didn't come to Tarja from Nightwish. I happened to buy both Dark Passion Play and My Winter Storm together because I wanted to listen to them together with no biases ahead of time as to what I would like or not.    Unfortunately I found DPP very lackluster, due to no fault of the new singer. I listened to it twice, the second time to confirm that it was still just as boring as the first time. Even had Tarja been on it, there was no saving it. I do own all their previous cds.    My Winter Storm, on the other hand, I've been listening to quite a bit.  I'm actually surprised at how much I'm enjoying it, considering my favorite Nightwish song is Dark Chest of Wonders. There is nothing with that kind of hard punch on this cd at all (though Die Alive has a decent hard drive to it). But if you enjoy Tarja's singing, I don't see how you wouldn't like this recording. The songs create an atmosphere that suit her voice and style perfectly.
0452289963|5.0|Once the book arrived in a timely manner and in new condition, I began reading on that same day.  The book, A New Earth, presents interesting and thought filled ideas on Life. I believe we all can relate to the author's explanations and thoughts on living life with purpose and how important it is to learn and become aware of what life is teaching us.
B000N3T0DW|4.0|Oustanding performance by Penelope Cruz. I especially enjoyed the scene with her singing. The story is both horrific and terrific at the same time. Even though there is tragedy the way the women are supportive of each other is admirable. Women need to be more like this in the real world.
0452289963|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I've read. But then it seems that everything that Oprah recommends for reading is. It is full of insights and yet easy to read. This book is for anybody that is looking to delve into a more \\"purposefull life\\".

B00132D808|4.0|The wait is finally over. It's been three years since Panic At The Disco, the exclamation point optional, released their debut album, A Fever You Can't Sweat Out. The band since then has grown and is headlining this years Honda Civic Tour with The Hush Sound, Motion City Soundtrack, and Phantom Planet. On March 25th, the band's sophomore album, Pretty.Odd (the punctuation never ends with these boys), was released. Let's say it was definitely a huge thing for their fans. On January 28th, the pre-order on Fueled By Ramen's, their record label, website was available and you had to wait at least five minutes for you even to be able to checkout. I know this from experience, no need to say that Panic At the Disco broke the internet that day.       Now if you don't know who Panic At The Disco is, don't know how you don't, \\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies\\" got so much air time there's no way you wouldn't recognize it you heard it. Anyways, Panic At the Disco consists of four very young guys. There's Ryan Ross who writes most of the lyrics, plays guitar and sings. Brendon Urie who's the lead singer, also plays piano and guitar. Then of course Jon Walker the bassist and Spencer Smith on drums. Basically they contacted Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy who flew out to Las Vegas to meet them and they were signed to Decaydance/Fueled By Ramen.     They tell us that they've been writing songs for us, and they sure have been. The album starts off with a song called \\"We're So Starving\\". They tell us in the song that \\"You don't have to worry because we're still the same band,\\", for the most part that is true, yet lies, well, the only lie is that Jon Walker wasn't on the first album, otherwise, it's correct. The song does have a nice flow to it and it starts the album of on a good note. It leads into the next song \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\", the album's first single. \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" brings a different side to Panic. Big horns and orchestra-like sounds. The song definitely stands out on thealbum, there really isn't another song like it. There is a calming outro at the end. At the same time, it stands out weirdly from the rest of the song, these nice, quiet strings. But I think that it leads well into the rest of the album, telling you \\"this isn't going quite where you think it is.\\" Next comes \\"She's a Handsome Women\\" as Panic continues with they're unique song titles. If you listen closely to the parts, the bass in this song is way more complex than the guitar, it's very amusing. \\"Don't You Know What I'm Seeing\\" seems to stand out as one of the favorites. There's sort-of sad lyrics hiding inside this song, and yet it makes me feel happy? Panic Magic? Who knows. I like the idea that life goes on, with or without you, and all you can hope is that the one you love goes with you. The weather doesn't give a damn about you at all. I didn't hear the bird noises at first, but they entertain me. And Spencer's in the back being subtly awesome, and it makes me happy. This song is eminently singable, and I already know all the words. I think it's kind of my stealth favorite. \\"That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed)\\" is the second single from this album (yet to be released). It's about how things can change you, even though you still feel like the same person, until suddenly you see how far you've come without realizing it.  It's definitely a good choice for the second single. \\"I Have Friends In Holy Places\\", there's ukulele, clarinets and Brendon Urie, well, he's a given. This song makes me smile all over my face, because it's adorable. This is jazzy and wild and lovely, and it's so NOT mainstream it makes me cry with joy. I suspect that a lot of Fever fans are going to hate it, but I don't know why because something about it reminds me of Better If You Do, so much so that on a mix I would probably put them next to each other. But at the end, the little outro feels almost like a melancholic echo, like the first part was a memory. The end of the songs brings you into the next song \\"Northern Downpour\\". The song would definitely be a good example of how the band sounds now, even though Ryan Ross believes that another song is, but, we'll get to that later. Ryan's voice being a real presence, and matched equally with Brendon's. Just the four of them, without too many bells and whistles, and a laid-back feeling that makes me think of warm spring days (funny, since they talk about a downpour...)         The next song is \\"When The Day Met The Night\\". This track is like Beatles music covered by The Polyphonic Spree, baked into a cupcake and iced with pure joy. How can you go wrong with a love song about the sun and the moon and bright chorus contrasts. The chorus versus the verses in this song is amazing - the verses are almost more melancholy, despite not being so lyrically, but the chorus is bright and happy. I love it. \\"Pas de Cheval\\" comes next. Now this is a song where you shouldn't judge the song by it's name because the song is nothing short of amazing. \\"The Piano Knows Something I Don't\\",In their MTV interview, Ryan calls this one experimental, so... news flash: the experiment was a success. I really dig the bookend feel to this, a little manic-almost-forced-feeling happiness shoehorned in between haunting little snippets that are not only melancholy, but are actually allowed to be.  I love the contrasts in this song of the intro/outro vs. the middle. The very quiet versus the the very bouncy, it is amazing and I adore it ridiculously. It brings a lot of interest to the song. \\"Behind the Sea\\" brings Ryan Ross singing lead vocals. Before hearing this version, I had heard the acoustic version. There's something really melancholy and beautiful in that version, and it exists here too, but it's carried along by the tempo and the rest of the instrumentation, almost as if our little melancholy songwriter is carried along with the tide of life being not-so-bad-today. (If I can get meta for a minute, this is probably the very best example of how Ryan's strange, sometimes overly maudlin lyrics become something completely different when they're incorporated into and augmented by the rest of the band. Fever was Ryan and a laptop, but Pretty is Ryan and Brendon and Spencer and Jon in a studio as a band. If Pretty's got a parade track, a Yellow Submarine track, this is it. The outro at the end is... odd compared to the rest of the song. I like it, but it's just. Odd.     \\"Folkin' Around\\". This is the one song I can talk forever about. It was written by Brendon Urie. This song is all Brendon. The number one thing I learned from this song is how much I love Brendon Urie. The number two thing I learned is how much I want him to do a song with Nickel Creek. (Or for Ryan to play more mandolin, I guess.) There's been rumors that this song has to do with his parents, and I don't know if that's based on anything that Brendon's said, or if others (like me) can spot \\"you suck Dad\\" lyrics a mile off. There's this attitude that Brendon has projected through the lyrics thats basically \\"forget everyone\\". For example: \\"And I'll even have the courtesy of admitting I was wrong / As the final words before I'm dead and gone\\", directed to the lover in the song or symbolically to someone else. I'm putting out the lantern, I'm not waiting for you anymore, you can find your own way back to me. There's a youth and a fragility in his voice that belies his nimble singing and the perky feel of the track.  Also, I just think it's really funny that Ryan, King of the Bizarre Metaphor (\\"aubergine dreams,\\" people!) \\"didn't get\\" this song at first.     \\"She Had The World\\" comes next. This is, like, a minstrel waltz, and I don't even know what to do with that. It's a backwards minstrel waltz, because it's not about the singer's love not loving him back, but about the singer not loving the lover.  It's incredibly beautiful and charming and mainstream radio is just going 'what are we going to do with this' and throwing up its hands. Next comes \\"From A Mountain in the Middle of the Cabins\\". Jon calls this one an outro for the feel of the record, and I think that's really true. But I also kinda think it's maybe a little bit of a goodbye to Fever, and their Vaudeville act. Maybe that's just the saloon piano and my own screwed-up logic talking. (How is it that Panic writes a song about a breakup and it makes me want to bounce in my seat and do a little soft shoe? I Do Not Know. If I ever meet Ryan, this is what I will ask him. (That, and where he gets his scarves.) Moving on. \\"Mad as Rabbits\\" closes the album. There is nothing that is not crazy and awesome about this song. This one would be interested paired with Nine In The Afternoon, especially for the video. The way Brendon sings \\"when I was a bird and you were a map!\\" reminds me of a Muppet, and I do not know why. (Brendon Urie = secretly created by Jim Henson?) Spencer, once again is in the back being subtly awesome. Ryan's really asserted himself as a regular vocalist in their band.. I kind of hope that Mad As Rabbits becomes a bit of a jam song, because I actually think that a little jam band mentality would go well with their new sound. I'm not talking Inna Gadda Davida, here, but there's room in the bridge for some extended solo work. Certainly they've got the chops for it.    In many other reviews Pretty.Odd has been called \\"copy of the Beatles\\" or just Beatles-esque. I definitely disagree with this. Panic has shown that they've improved their sound, bringing a whole new style to their music. So, definitely pick up a copy because this ish is Bananas. No, seriously, it is.
1400082773|5.0|What surprised me most about \\"Dreams From My Father\\" is how well written it is. Being that this book was written by a politician, I expected something much drier.  It turns out, though, that Mr. Obama has a natural flair for writing, and it was a pleasure to read.<br /><br />The story is exceptional as well.  Essentially, it is of a mixed-race man coming to terms with himself and his family's history while straddling the racial divide. His perspective provided me with some insights I did not have before, and took me on his journey of body and spirit.<br /><br />If you are looking for a political piece, then this isn't the right book.  \\"Dreams\\" was written before Barack Obama decided to enter the political arena, so there isn't much mention of traditional politics or Washington attitudes. However, the story is compelling.  The visual nature of his writing successfully brings the reader along his existence in Hawaii, California, Chicago, Indonesia, and his visit to Kenya.  It truly is a stunning piece.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this book to anyone, regardless of your political opinion.
B00132D808|5.0|Yes this album is very different from the last one. But if you listen to it in it's own right, and don't compare it to the last album, this one is amazing. The musicianship has improved so much...fans should be impressed that the band has evolved beyond the synthesizer. I can hear a harpsichord, a tuba, and numerous other instruments. One of the other band members sings on a few of the tracks, and it is a nice departure. The multi-group member singing makes me think of the Beatles. Every band changes. If they were to stay the exact same, it would get pretty old, pretty fast.
B000ZN802W|4.0|Not a bad film if you havent read the book. But that goes for most films.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Great series!  The kind of hero who makes your blood run cold.  Twists & turns everywhere.  I wound up on HIS side after seeing the entire series. NOT for the faint of heart.  Waiting for NEXT season!
B0015T7Q98|5.0|...and this change worked. The guys have ditched the emo look/sound have have matured into the album called Pretty. Odd. This is a quantum leap better than A Fever... and is way work artistic and interesting. I am glad they took the risk to sacrifice the dancable beats for melodies, harmonies, and good instrumentation.     People don't like change, but this change is for the better.   Job well done Panic at the Disco!
1401200605|5.0|Jeph Loeb writes comics like summer movie blockbusters with a galaxy of stars. These movies, or comics, can be fun but may lack substance. In Hush we have an action packed story with a parade of guest stars, heroes and villains alike. Are their appearances mainly to add star power? Possibly. Do they add to the enjoyment of the story? Definately. This is no different from his previous sagas Long Halloween and Dark Victory. One thing is certain, with Jim Lee as cinematographer/artist, they have never looked better. Batman's always been a top leading man and remains a draw. As leading lady we have Catwoman, Poison Ivy is the temptress, Talia al Ghul the femme fatale. Add the Joker, Harley Quinn, Clayface, Harvey Dent, Killer Croc, Huntress, Scarecrow, Nightwing, Superman, Lois Lane ...whew, talk about a big budget flick. Here lies many of the barbs hurled at Hush.  Some criticize it as a visual tour de force by the great Jim Lee and nothing more than eye candy. The plot has flaws. The reveal of the antagonist is a foregone conclusion and his motivations for becoming Hush are dubious, but now we're missing the point. This isn't about reason or logic. For fans of that there are better choices and to demand it here is being a stick in the mud. This story is all about fun, and in the context of movie blockbusters it's a complete and total success.
