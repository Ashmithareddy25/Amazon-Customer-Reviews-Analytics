1451629184|5.0|This is a beautiful book.    What I have come to understand is that this is not a book about a kidnapping. This is a book about a spiritually gifted woman navigating her way through a life marked by deeply moving events. I am humbled by what I have read.    Ms Dugard is able to continue down a path of personal growth under the most constrained circumstances. The journal entries from her captivity, both as a child and later as an adult, reveal the amazingly positive energy she carries within her. She has the capacity for self-reflection at a young age, even though she is denied any personal autonomy. Later, she is able to build a semblance of a normal life for her children, home schooling them with her own curriculum despite only having a 5th grade education. She plants a garden, cares for her animals, even manages a business. All of this while enduring the constant abuse of a hyper-controlling, drug-addicted psychopath.    I am deeply inspired by her ability to keep pouring love out into the world despite being treated so horridly. Rather than turn away to some dark place, Ms Dugard performs a kind of spiritual judo, reflecting back love and compassion on the animals in her care, the children she's struggling to raise and the distant memory of her mother. She is able to resist the temptation to spew forth hatred upon the perpetrators of her abuse. Instead, she lets it go and moves on to a better place.    Frankly, I'm a bit ashamed that my initial interest in this book was based on sensationalist media coverage of the events surrounding her rescue. I was expecting to learn more about her captors and what kind of person would commit such a horrendous crime. After finishing the book, I've realized that don't care about them. Instead, I've learned something about myself: that I never need give up hope. No situation requires that I compromise myself or my beliefs. I can see now experiences in my own life where I was sucked in by the spiritual traps that Ms Dugard successfully navigated around for 18 years. I have a new role model to look up to.    Ms Dugard is living proof that \\"life can start over.\\" I am indebted to her for a new understanding of those words.    Thank you.
B0024Y7H10|5.0|I give the first episode 5 start, is a very good beginning, in my opinion in the whole serie not all chapter are very good but some of them are really very enjoyable.
B004WKOCP8|1.0|5 years in the making and with fantastic producer, Brendan O'brian, and this is what we get??!?  WOW is all I have to say.  I wasnt expecting it to be the same exact thing as all of their older albums but, c'mon...this sounds like the rest of the adult contemporary crap out there.  Literally, this would be a great album for the likes of Taylor Swift to come out with.  Yes, Brandon has a great voice but Incubus is all about the awesome music they make as a band....this is just as bad as his solo project and that was BADBADBAD. Listen to \\"In the company of Wolves\\" and see if you dont want to jump off your roof by the middle of it. Oh well, let's keep our fingers crossed for the 2016 release of their next one and im going to pretend this one just didnt happen.
1594744769|4.0|This was a great read. I expected more of a horror novel after reading through the introduction. I was pleasantly surprised and the book was great. It was fast paced and I truly felt like I knew and understood all of the characters. Jacob was a great character and I felt like he represented a 16 year old boy. The antique photographs were incredible and truly helped me visualize characters from an era way before my time.<br /><br />From the beginning to the end I was on the edge of my seat. There were so many twists and turns in the story it is hard to put the book down. My only disappointment was that it ended quickly. I am hoping that a continuation of the story is in the works and I am excited to read on and find out what happens to these peculiar children.
B004WKOCP8|1.0|I've been listening to Incubus for many many years now, I have all their albums and can respect each one to a certain extent. I'm not going to say I've liked each album equally, because that would be foolish. I'm also a big fan of music in general and I fully understand that groups want to branch out and make something new. But never have I seen such a drastic change take such a bad turn for the worst. It's almost as if Incubus decided that they were going to scrap their entire fanbase and try to create a new one when making this album . It seems preposterous that any group would ever do this, but after listening to this album multiple times all I can say this is not Incubus. When listening to this entire album I think the main keypoints one can gather is that Brandon Boyd, as usual, is a great singer and the music is very slow with no standouts. Yes, Brandon sounds wonderful in the songs but it actually means nothing. There are more parts to the \\"music equation\\". You need a composition that is interesting and the vocals should compliment this composition and give it life. All the songs are dead. The compositions are so bland, I can't even begin to imagine how this CD came together. It's as if the entire group was replaced and Brandon Boyd was the only constant remaining. Almost like a Brandon Boyd solo CD gone wrong. Incubus has been known to give you catchy bass lines, guitar solos, a nice drum beat, and of course Brandon's voice to bring it all together. It's not as if when making \\"slower\\" and \\"darker\\" music that you can't compile these elements into your songs, but that's exactly what Incubus did in their cd \\"If Not Now, When?\\". Nothing musically significant was gained from this cd. Nowhere in the CD did I say to myself: \\"Wow, that's a very nice bass line that they developed\\" or \\"The guitar rhythm in this song is very catchy\\".    I think it would only be right if I tried to relate what another group did to change their style 360 degrees with great success. Pretty similar actually what Incubus tried doing with the CD, a dark and slow CD. If you've never heard of them, check out the group Opeth. Opeth can be categorized in many different genres, but they came to fame with their \\"death metal\\" style. Brutal and vicious screams, very fast paced rhythm, but brought together beautifully with a sense of musical genius. The singer of this group (Mikael Åkerfeldt - extremely gifted as a singer and guitar player) would in many cases break out of his \\"death growls\\" and bless you with angelic vocals. They had a huge \\"death metal/Progressive metal\\" following and all of a sudden in 2003 they decided to make an album that was entirely different than ANYTHING they had ever done. They decided to create an album without any death growls by Mikael, the musical composition would involve much more acoustic guitars, and everything would be slowed down almost to an extreme measure (compared to their past music). So what happened to this CD? Well, check the review for it here on amazon: [[ASIN:B00008OLYN Damnation]]. Quite frankly, if you have any passion towards music, it can only be described as a \\"masterpiece\\". To bring this all together, the point I'm trying to make is that groups have changed their style in the past and have succeeded by making something significant. \\"If Not Now, When?\\" leaves nothing significant and leaves me highly disappointed.     It's depressing to think that I will have to wait a few more years for Incubus to release a new album. I just hope they decide to dig down deep and make something significant musically. Significant like S.C.I.E.N.C.E., Make Yourself, and Morning View was.    That's just my two cents. If you'd like, reply to my review and give me and everyone else your opinion.    -Cheers and Godspeed-
B003K1EYM6|1.0|First, I'd like to say that I bought this product directly from Apple, so Amazon has nothing to do with this review. I'm an amateur photog mamarazzi and was excited about the prospect of using my new ipad2 to view photos immediately. The first time I used this, I used the card reader and everything downloaded fine. Second time I tried to use the card reader, I found it had fried and I was no longer able to fit the SD card into it. I tried forcing it a couple of times, but then realized it was no longer working. I abandoned the download-to-ipad route for a couple of weeks until the day of my son's graduation from pre-K.     Too much in a rush to not download my \\"usual\\" way (to pc, back up pc, etc.) and too excited to view the pics, I used the camera reader part of this kit thinking it would be fool-proof. Long story short, it ended up wiping out all the files from the SD card without even downloading one pic to the ipad. I tried reading the files on a pc, but they were all gone and unretrievable. Rookie mistake to abandon my old routine, but I never thought I'd lose my precious pics this way.     This kit has ended up being completely useless. Still love the ipad but I've learned my lesson about all the kits and auxiliary stuff that apple tries to sell you on. My new philosophy is that if it's not already built in, it's not worth buying. I still regret losing the pre-K pics...just my warning for you!
B0000013GT|5.0|I grew up in Bronx N.Y listening to Nas, Big Pun, Biggie, KRS ONE etc but when I first heard this album in 96 which to me was the best year in hip-hop with all these classic albums coming out like Redman's Muddy Waters among others to me Outkast outshines all albums that came out that year. From the first track to the last it had PERFECT written all over it, classic will be an understatement to me if that makes any sense. I still listen to Atliens and it still tops any album that's coming out these days...Hip-Hop will never be the same again :(
0425166805|5.0|This is an awesome book. This is not a Science Fiction. This is a \\"Hypothesis\\" of the truth that must have happened and may be continuing to happen for a reason.    Marvelous thoughts and unanswerable questions in every page.    I watched \\"Ancient Gods\\" in History TV. But This little book has more details.     We really need Writer/Researcher/Scientist like Eric Von Daniken.
B001AQT11M|5.0|purchased for my four year old granddaughter. she is enjoying the movie as much as I did as a child.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just watched this series on Netflix.  It's awesome.  I really love it and am ordering it right now from Amazon.  I'm a bit bummed I didn't catch it when it was first aired and I'm extremely bummed it's not still on the air.  It really is great!!
B0000C6K09|5.0|I really enjoy this CD, the orchestra plays fantastic, the only one that dissapoint me is the close encounters of the third kind, i would've like to hear more about the diologue, that would have been great, but i like how the orchestra played it, anyway i really recommend you this product :)
0545259088|5.0|This is the third and final book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series by Stiefvater.  I was very excited to get an Advanced Reading Copy of this book at Book Expo America.  This book did an excellent job of wrapping up this series. It is a bit slow, like all of the book in the series have been, but if you liked the previous books in the series you will love this one.<br /><br />As Spring slowly creeps into Mercy Falls, MN things are on the cusp of changing.  Sam still doesn't know if his cure is for real.  Grace is lost in the woods as a wolf, just waiting to change back to a girl.  Cole is still desperately trying to find a cure for their curse.  Meanwhile Isabel's father is out for the wolves' blood; he has a manhunt planned soon for these wolves.  What will happen next is anyone's guess.<br /><br />As with all the books in this series the writing style is beautiful but slow.  There are long periods of time where Stiefvater is just following the characters around in their day to day life, then suddenly BOOM!, tons of stuff happens.  Then it is back to a slower pace again.  If you have already read the rest of this series you know that's how these books are, and if you like that you will love this book.<br /><br />This book focuses on Isabel and Cole almost as much as Sam and Grace.  In fact there isn't a ton of romantic tension between Sam and Grace; they love each other and know it.  The other thing that really propels the book forward is their race against time to save the wolves.  They are trying to save the wolves somehow, before Isabel's father hunts them down.  To add to this you have the temperature uncertainty that makes various characters randomly revert to wolf form.<br /><br />There is a lot of tension in this book and a lot of uncertainty.  Things are tied up nicely in the end.  Although there are a couple things that could have been tied up with more definition...who knows maybe those things will be part of a spin-off series or something.<br /><br />The characterization in this book is perfect; these are wonderful characters that I really enjoy reading about.  It was torture to watch them go through some parts in this book, but in the end that made the resolution all the sweeter.  The book is hard to put down and incredibly engaging.<br /><br />There are some additional things I really enjoyed about this book.  I really enjoyed Cole's experimentation with cures, he was a great character and so fun to read about as he dabbled in science.  I also enjoyed that the book takes place in my home state of MN!  I love how spot on Stiefvater is in her description of Minnesota springs.<br /><br />Overall I absolutely devoured this book.  I loved it to death.  Great resolution to the series, wonderful characters, engaging plot, and beautiful writing.  The pace is a bit slow for me, but that just seems to be Stiefvater's writing style and I have slowly grown to enjoy it.  Definitely read this if you had read the previous books.  I recommend this series if you are looking for a young adult paranormal series that doesn't mind dwelling on the beauty of its surroundings and on the little things that make love tick.ct; these are wonderful characters that I really enjoy reading about.

1451629184|4.0|The most important thing I wanted to take away from my reading this book was the understanding of how Phillip Garrido had such a mental grip on Jaycee and why, when it seemed like she had many opportunities, she didn't choose to run.  After reading, I think I get it.  I think Garrido was methodical and planned strategic ways to shut Jaycee off from everything she knew in the world, and then slowly \\"rewarding\\" her little by little with the smallest things, which seemed magnificent to someone who was handcuffed to a bed and didn't even have a toilet.  Combine that with the malleable mental state of an 11-year-old, and it seems to make sense.    Jaycee doesn't seem to paint the picture of her home life with her mom and step-dad as a very healthy, loving environment.  Is that why she felt that if she ran from Garrido, as she says:  \\"where would I go?\\"  So sad.    In the book, Jaycee only gives graphic sexual details one or two times, and it is disgusting to read about.  In some ways, I wish those details were left out, because somewhere, some freak like Garrido will enjoy reading it.  But I am glad those details were left to a minimum, considering that she was a sex slave.    There's nothing more disgusting than someone who victimizes women and children.  To those reading this, please be vigilant when it comes to noticing the signs.  Garrido's religious fanaticism was a great clue in the matter.  In my experience, when someone is that far \\"out there\\" with their Scriptural theories and their seeking to gain a following, there is often another side of them that is just as imbalanced, manifesting itself through a lack of self-control and sexual deviancy.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I am a big Incubus fan.  At first I wasn't too sure about this one, but after multiple listens I started to get it.  It's a heartfelt, sincere album by a creative force with a track record for making great music.  I expect them to lose fans with this offering, but they won't lose me.    Highlights:      The Original  In the Company of Wolves (one of the best songs they've ever written, 2 songs in 1)  Switchblade  Adolescents  Tomorrow's Food (reminiscent of Aqueous Transmission)    The second half of this album sounds more like vintage Incubus, if that's what fans are looking for.   I'm open to change, and have embraced this one.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The game plays smoothly on Droid X running gingerbread. Nice graphics. Fun concept. Not as frustrating as Angry Birds. Has replay value.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|This c.d. is actually pretty good but I thought it would be better because of Butch Vic producing it. He produced Nirvana's album great why not this. It doesnt top the colour and the shape or a few others they have made so far. It is still a good addition though. Best songs are burning bridge,dear rosemary, rope and arlandria.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Game is fun and well written, but has the worst trouble starting up on a samsung captivate 2.2. Takes for ever to get it running right then runs smooth in game.
B004NSULHM|5.0|To me when this c.d. came out I said there is no way that they could top their last one. After two full listenings of the c.d. I mentally stood amazed. It is more experimental than any of their previous work but it is a beautiful listening experience. A must have for Radiohead fans.
B0018M6J90|5.0|If you are a fan of chick flicks like Emma, Sabrina,  Becoming Jane, Anne of Green Gables etc. by all means order this movie.  It's a face paced, feel good movie with heartache, whimsy  and outrageous antics.  Amy Adams and Francis McDormand make a fantastic mismatched pair that paint the town in a  24 hour period, pre WW 2 England.  Juicy high society blackmail, deceit and an good old fashioned makeover.  Grab a bag of low cal popcorn, your favorite blanket and shut off your phone's ringer.
1451629184|5.0|I went back and forth whether or not to buy this book.  I don't like to read in detail horrible things that happen to children because it literally makes me sick to my stomach.  I thought to myself if nothing else, let me pay the 11.99 to support this girl.  I started reading the book at 9:30 at night, I'm writing this at midnight and I've just completed the book.  I couldn't put it down. Although there were some graphic details, it was here and there and the rest I thought she worded very well.  It was the most heart wrenching and inspiring book I've ever read.  I've never cried when reading a book before but this one had me balling during many parts.  It really puts things into perspective for you. Like most americans watching the recent ABC special on Jaycee, I was very moved by her strength and at the same time stunned with shocked that something like this could have happened right under law enforcement's nose.  After hearing about the book, I just had this overwhelming feeling that I wanted to know how in the world this amazing young woman survived this horrific ordeal. Buy this book!  Even if you don't read it, buy it and donate it but spend your money to help a good cause.  I don't care if Jaycee puts the book proceeds on a crap table in Vegas, this girl deserves every dime she can make to try and have the best rest of her life she can. Again amazing book.
0802130208|5.0|I thought this book was genius, but not everyone will agree.   Great characters, quirky story line. My advice - read it and see for yourself. A little background - author committed suicide, mom cleans out room years later, finds book, takes it  to local college professor.  It is published and author wins PULITZER  posthumously.  PLEASE OH PLEASE DO NOT LET ADAM SANDLER MAKE THIS INTO A MOVIE AND TOTALLY RUIN IT FOR ME!
B00000I41J|5.0|If you know and love Miles Davis from the late 1950s `Kind of Blue' period but haven't heard anything recorded under Julian `Cannonball' Adderley's own name, you're likely to love and appreciate `Somethin Else.' It's the perfect Blue Note companion to KoB and in the same groove, with superlative playing throughout from Adderley on alto sax and Miles on trumpet together with Hank Jones on piano, and a rhythm section made up of Art Blakey on drums and Sam Jones on bass.<br /><br />It's difficult to pick out highlights on a collection so uniformly excellent, but the 11-minute opener `Autumn Leaves' is a true jazz classic which you'll think you've always known, so recognisably familiar is the melody. The title track, showcasing the horn interplay between Miles and Cannonball chasing each other all over the scales in an exuberant and up-tempo duet sounds like a cut which escaped from the KoB sessions, and `One for Daddy-O' with its slower tempo and stand-out uncomplicated melody also shines. In the sparse, clean and bluesy `Dancing in the Dark' we hear Cannonball at his soulful best, his horn soaring with a long, slow-tempo solo over a perfectly understated rhythm.<br /><br />The music here is instantly accessible, with nothing unnecessarily complex or jarring. You can listen to the album again and again, no matter what you're doing, though one or two of the numbers are perhaps a little up-tempo for dinner-party background ambience. Overall `Somethin Else' is an indispensable jazz classic which stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the very best of Miles, Trane or Charlie Parker.<br /><br />The nickname `Cannonball' BTW came from a corruption of `Cannibal' due to Adderley's huge appetite for food and habit of eating absolutely everything available at every opportunity, the result manifest in his generously proportioned, rotund and substantial physique. But boy, can he play that horn.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I sit through countless hours of horrible kid TV and movies.  This is one of the few movies I can watch with my kids over again.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It starts off a bit slow then really starts to pick up and gets very exciting. The long wait for this book is worth it and if you are a true Martin fan, you will not be disappointed.
B004EPZ084|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. It had the right amount of dark humor. Bateman, Sudeikis, and Day were perfect together, even though Day was probably the most annoying character because of his whiny voice. Three friends hate their manipulative bosses and decide to hire a hitman to kill them. They get MF Jones to be their murder consultant. They break into each boss's house and figure out how to kill them. Will they go thru with it? I highly recommend HORRIBLE BOSSES!!!
B004EPYZU8|1.0|What can I say about this movie that other's have not already.  it's sucks. there I said it it sucks. When this dvd drops to $5.00's I'll buy   a copy just so I can have a copy of the very good 3d work.  but as a movie it's a suck hole.    Personal recommendation don't use amazon movie reviews to pick a movie your looking for.  Far as I can tell people are pumping up bad films to get them sold.  no one, with even a half a brain would think this film deserved more than one star.  I only give it one star because I can't give it zero stars.    Get your reviews from [...]

0061784788|4.0|It's been a long time since I've read Rollins and I haven't kept up with the Sigma Force series since Black Order, but The Devil Colony sounded too intriguing to resist.  The premise involves various components:  the founding fathers, Mormonism, the Lewis & Clark expedition, American Indians, and nanotechnology.  The connections Rollins makes between all of these things should be taken at face value.  He presents American lore as pure entertainment to weave a good conspiracy.  The author's note at the end was helpful in separating fact from fiction and the small grains of truth he does extract from American history are developed into an entertaining novel.  This was an altogether fun book that illustrated amazing scenes and sights unique to the U.S.  Rollins effectively manipulates aspects of modern technology and a few long standing mysteries to create a fast-paced and engaging adventure.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|One of my all time favorite films, if you're tired of those computer generated films then this good ol' fashioned stop motion animation will get you laughing throughout the whole movie. This film is more directed to an adult audience, but some children may like it if the understand dry humor.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|Movie was nicely done with a lot of heartfelt and exciting moments.  The acting was very good as was the training of the horse(s).  It is a great family movie or a great movie to watch alone.  I recommend it highly if you are into \\"horse\\" movies and history.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|Although this film is still a historical atrocity, Cate's performance is much better and more Elizabeth-like than in the first movie. I am almost used to the unbridled distortion of historical fact in these flicks, but what moron thought he could improve on Elizabeth's magnificent speech at Tilbury? And giving Mary a Scottish accent isn't license; it's just ignorance.

142311339X|4.0|The Lost Hero is the first novel in Rick Riordan's Heroes of Olympus series. It's a companion series to the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, taking place shortly after The Last Olympian. The novel focuses on Jason, Piper and Leo and their quest to rescue Hera, Piper's dad, and stop the powerful titan Gaea from rising and destroying the world.<br /><br />The book is just as good as Riordan's other novels. The characters are clever, funny, and well thought out. The plot is interesting, and he introduces new ideas that are very compelling. The novel is in 3rd person (as opposed to Percy Jackson's 1st person) and the novel switches between the points of view of Jason, Piper, and Leo, in that order. This makes the book a great deal longer than any of the others, but it lets the reader see inside the minds of the three main characters, not just the one.<br /><br />The best part about this novel is the introduction of the Roman mythology. The last twenty pages were fantastic when it was revealed that there are as many Roman demigods as there are Greek ones, and they have their own camp too. I'm definitely excited to see where this goes. However, I don't like that Percy's memory is gone! He definitely better get that back, and I do not want to see any confusion on his part about Annabeth. Nuh uh.<br /><br />Piper is probably my favorite character. She's awesome. She's completely opposite from the stereotypical child of Aphrodite, and she's powerful and smart. I liked her chapters the best, but that might also have to do with the fact that I am a girl.<br /><br />Jason needs to get his memories back. Characters aren't really interesting or emotional unless you know their past. Riordan gave a lot of wonderful information about Piper's and Leo's childhoods, but obviously we know nothing about Jason, and even after he starts to remember things, we still don't know much. Piper's and Leo's backstories were some of the best parts of the book.<br /><br />And of course, we have all the same elements that made Percy Jackson so great. Important figures from Greek mythology are introduced, like Midas and Medea. The writing is clever and funny. The book is fast paced, although the length does make it difficult to follow the story. I can't remember things that happened in the beginning of the book so well, and it seems like the story didn't quite flow.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good start to a new series. I am hoping that the next books are better, and I don't think I'll be disappointed. The next book has chapters from Percy's POV, and I'm very excited about this. I'm hoping Annabeth gets a few chapters too. I wonder if Jason, Piper, or Leo will get their own chapters in the upcoming books, or if Riordan will do different characters each novel. I'm not sure what he's going to do.<br /><br />If you like Percy Jackson, I definitely suggest this book. It keeps the story and the world alive, and it adds more knowledge about Roman mythology that you can learn about. Riordan is wonderful.Jackson so great.

1423101499|5.0|Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Battle of the Labyrinth is Rick Riordan's fourth Percy Jackson novel. Grover is still searching for the lost god Pan, but there are bigger issues at hand. The crew decide to enter Daedalus's labyrinth to try to find the creator before Luke and his crew do. Whoever gets to him first will control the Labyrinth, and unless Percy, Annabeth, and a mortal can find him, the forces of Kronos will attack Camp Half-Blood, and then Olympus itself.<br /><br />Battle of the Labyrinth is, of course, just as great as the first three Percy Jackson books. Riordan focuses mainly on the story of the inventor Daedalus and his infamous maze, now located below the United States. He draws on famous myths, like the stories of Icarus and Calypso, and some lesser known ones, like the cleaning of Geryon's stables. The book is a collection of adventures set underground, with the character's trying desperately to save their friends and the world.<br /><br />Let's just get this out of the way: Percy and Annabeth are the cutest couple in the world. I definitely died when she kissed him, but then they fought the whole rest of the book! Annabeth is jealous of Rachel and Percy is jealous of Luke, and they never talk about how they feel, and it sucks. But they're still perfect.<br /><br />Rachel Elizabeth Dare came back. I liked her a lot. She was almost like a non-half blood Annabeth. She's smart and feisty, but there's a barrier between her and everyone else because she isn't a demigod. She has the Sight, but she can only lead them. She can't follow. Also, Percy can't seem to sort out his feelings for her. Rachel shows yet again that anyone can help the world, no matter how insignificant they might think they are.<br /><br />\\"As I sailed into the lake I realized the Fates really were cruel... For the rest of my life I would be thinking about her. She would always be my biggest what if.\\"<br /><br />Riordan deals with love quite a bit in this book. Grover has a girlfriend! You go, Grover. Percy spends two weeks on Calypso's island, growing more and more fond of her. But in the end he has to leave her because he needs to help his friends. He knows that he could stay with her forever and never have a burden, but he can't do it; he has too many responsibilities. However, he'll always be thinking about how he could have lived with her carefree forever, never fulfilling the prophecy or having to fight in the war. Percy is sent to Calypso's island right after Annabeth kisses him. This throws a wrench in their relationship, which they never talk about. Percy has this what if with Calypso, and Annabeth has this what if with Luke, and they both know that they won't ever be with them, but the possibility of it will always be there, hiding in the shadows.<br /><br />Then there's the unromantic love. Most of Nico's actions are motivated by his desire to retrieve his sister from the underworld. Minos manages to manipulate him because of this desire. In the end, Nico realizes she is gone, and they say goodbye. Percy loves his friends and will do anything to save them. He also loves his mother enough to tell Mr. Blowfish to marry her.<br /><br />But Percy loves everyone a bit too much. He would sacrifice himself to save pretty much anyone. He spares the life of Someone Nakamura, who ends up freeing Kronos. In Mockingjay, Katniss would have just killed him. But Percy's way too nice for that. That's definitely a disadvantage.<br /><br />Riordan deals with the issues of meeting your hero. Tyson meets Briares, a famous Hundred Handed One, who he has looked up to his whole life. But Briares lets him down by refusing to fight and running away. Annabeth meets her hero Daedalus, but he won't help them, and it's revealed that he murdered his nephew. Even Percy questions what he believes when he meets a half-brother of his who makes human sacrifices in Poseidon's name. These three were forced to face the reality that even heroes are not perfect, and they are disappointed.<br /><br />However, all of these characters came through in the end. Briares and Daedalus show up to help Camp Half-Blood fight Kronos's army. Briares tells Tyson that he helped him remember what it is to be a Cyclops, and he decides to go to the forges to help teach other Cyclopes. Daedalus gives up his life to destroy the labyrinth, and he gifts Annabeth with all his architectural ideas. Poseidon comes to Percy's birthday party and tells him that just because people make sacrifices in the name of the gods does not mean that the gods want them. Also, Percy is totally his favorite son.<br /><br />Riordan is showing the reader that it's possible to make amends for bad things. Daedalus killed his nephew and felt responsible for the death of his son, but in the end he fights for the right side and he gets to apologize to them in the Fields of Asphodel. Briares gave up, but he was inspired to fight and then give back to the Cyclopes. No character-or person-is perfect. Everyone makes mistakes. It's what you do after that mistake that counts.<br /><br />Then there's Grover finally meeting Pan, and it was everything Grover could have hoped for, except that Pan died. But before he did, Pan put a little of himself into each of them, and Grover knows that he has to carry on in his place, that they all do. Grover is the ultimate environmentalist. He met his hero, his hero died, and it inspired him to try to save the world, the way Pan would have wanted it. This shows that death can inspire.<br /><br />Luke is dead? It's unclear, I suppose. I'm holding out hope that Luke will be able to switch sides in the end. He gained a lot of sympathy from me last book. He's gotten in over his head, and it's like the themes of Daedalus and Briares; Luke can always make amends.<br /><br />Nico is an extremely interesting character. He started off as an antagonist to Percy and the gang, but he switched sides and joined them. However, it's clear that Nico has a nature derived from his heritage that he can't shake off. He has control of the dead, and even though he uses it to help the right side, he might still turn evil and fulfill the prophecy. I'm a bit wary about him.<br /><br />This was a fantastic book.

031606792X|5.0|I found this book to be entertaining, sweet, sadistic, loving, funny (laught out loud) and memorable.  I do not know what all the criticisms were about regarding this book.  I don't \\"get\\" that.  And, I don't want to.  Books are to be opened, read, and enjoyed.  Some will teach us, some will not.  If not, if you don't like them, shut the book and be still.  There seems to be many who believe they have the right to judge this book.  How funny is that?  I believe [that] if you have the talent to write a book, have it published, make some reward monitarily and do what you love, knowing you won't please everyone but you might please a few, then GOOD FOR YOU!  So, those of you who judged this Author and this book without the benefit of writing a book yourselves, should be ashamed of yourselves.  How old am I?  Older than you AND your Mother!.  JC IN PA  By the way, anyone who quotes Orson Scott Card in their book, has great taste!
0786838655|5.0|Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is the first of Rick Riordan's series about a 12 year old boy who finds out he is half human, half god. His mother is kidnapped, and he finds himself on a quest with his two friends to return Zeus's lightning bolt to him.<br /><br />The book is obviously meant for ages 10 to 14 ish, but I (being 19 years old) absolutely loved it. The Greek mythology is both accurate and clever, and the written is easy to read and hilarious. There are also great underlying themes of putting aside prejudices and fighting your own battles. Annabeth is very adamant that she shouldn't like Percy because their parents are enemies, but by the end of the book Annabeth tells Percy that she's on his side no matter what. Percy learns about sacrifice through his mother's past, and he learns about corruption through Luke.<br /><br />Overall, the book was seriously great. It was funny and clever, well written and interesting, and it teaches great lessons. I would love to teach this book if I was ever given the chance, and I look forward to reading the rest of the series.

0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an epistolary novel by Stephen Chbosky. The letters are written by \\"Charlie\\" to an anonymous person called \\"friend.\\" Charlie tells the friend about his first year of high school as he makes friends and deals with family and personal issues. Charlie becomes best friends with step siblings Sam and Patrick, and he has an intellectual relationship with his English teacher \\"Bill.\\" Charlie has been told that he needs to be more active in his life, and that's what he tries to do.<br /><br />The novel is brilliant. The form is perfect because it's as if the author is talking to the reader. Charlie tells all his most personal thoughts, and it's as if the letters are helping him discover the meaning of the events in his life. The writing is funny and clever, but it's also clear that there's something not right with Charlie, but that's not divulged until the end. The plot is engaging and deals with many important issues, like homophobia and abuse, and also the struggles of just growing up and making friends.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to have to reread this book. It's definitely going to be a different reading the second time around. I didn't get any hint that Charlie had been abused by his aunt until the epilogue, and then once Chbosky said it, the hints became clear, but I'll still have to reread it to get them all. The way Chbosky dealt with all of the issues in this book was brilliant. Not only Charlie's abuse, but also his sister's abuse by her boyfriend and her abortion, and the abuse of many adults in Charlie's life. Chbosky lets the reader get inside the mind of Charlie and see just how traumatic the abuse was. I probably shouldn't be writing this right now because I haven't quite processed the whole novel, but oh well.<br /><br />Basically, there isn't much to analyze because if you read it yourself, you will get it. You don't need me to point out the meaning in any of this, because it's right there for you. Chbosky's writing is clear and concise, and while he doesn't at all explain his themes, you will get them effortlessly. The writing is easy to read and understand, and it allows the reader to get his or her own message from it.<br /><br />My only other thoughts really are, how will they make this into a movie? I can't really picture Emma Watson as Sam. I hope she's good. I'm sure Logan Lerman will be fantastic, because he's wonderful. I just really hope it's done tastefully and effectively. The one thing I don't want to see is some awful \\"trippy\\" scene when Charlie is on LSD, with the camera tilt and the blurry vision. I do not need that. But really, the movie can't be as good as the book simply because of the book's format. You can't make a movie comprised of letters, and that's the best part about the book.<br /><br />This book was fantastic, and if you haven't read it, you need to. Chbosky talks about issues that everyone might not have gone through, but he also deals with universal experiences, like making friends and graduation. I read the book in like two hours, and it may be short, but it's wonderfully meaningful and powerful.while he doesn't at all explain his themes, you will get them effortlessly.

B004K4IZ3G|1.0|I didn't see the original movie, but if it was anything like this one I can see why they waited thirty years to re-make it!    Bad, bad acting by Garret Hedlund, not captivating at all.  Insipid and boring, yes!    The only thing I liked was how good Jeff Bridges looked as Clu.  Jeff NEVER looked THAT good as a young man.    At the end of the movie the three of us regretted watching this instead of America's Got Talent!    Avoid it!
1423101502|5.0|Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Last Olympian is the fifth and final installment in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson series. The book focuses on the final battle of the gods and demigods versus the evil titan Kronos, whose consciousness is in the body of Percy and Annabeth's old friend Luke. The good guys are required to fight a variety of powerful monsters, causing Percy to do some very dangerous things to try to save his friends.<br /><br />This book is really just a long account of a battle. They start the fighting a little over 100 pages into the 381 page novel. This book is a lot darker and scarier than the first fourth. I was constantly worried that Percy or Annabeth would die, and it wasn't clear what exactly would happen in the end. But there were still Riordan's classic moments of comedy and romance, and it was just as good as the rest of the series.<br /><br />I'm not sure what to say about this book. There isn't much to commentate about a collection of battles, but it was very interesting to read. It was action-packed, obviously, and all the old characters were there. I was very worried that Clarisse was going to die, but then it was Silena, and I actually saw that coming. She was my first thought as to who the spy could be, but then I figured it wasn't her because of Beckendorf. I was sad about his death.<br /><br />There were a lot of great Percy/Annabeth moments in this book. I was very upset when Rachel kissed Percy in the beginning, but she made up for it later by \\"dumping\\" him. She became the new oracle, which was great. Rachel is an awesome character. But anyway, Percy and Annabeth were just as cute as usual, especially when Annabeth was hurt protecting him. And of course I was very excited when they got together in the end. Totally killed me.<br /><br />Grover is awesome. I don't think he gets enough time in the books. I'd love to see what he's doing in the forests. He's got a ton of power, and he's hilarious too. Grover should get his own series. (On a side note, I'm 50 pages in The Last Hero and there's no Grover? Boo.)<br /><br />The title of the book refers to Hestia, goddess of the hearth. It was such a beautiful moment when Percy gave her the jar filled with hope \\"because Hope survives best at the hearth.\\" Take from that what you will.<br /><br />I was pretty pleased with the ending of the battle. I'm glad Luke got his redemption, because I'd been rooting for him pretty much since the beginning. Riordan obviously wants to convey that no one is beyond saving, like with the characters in Battle of the Labyrinth, and Luke made up for his mistakes in the end. The way Riordan made the Great Prophecy be fulfilled was amazing.<br /><br />A series can really only come to an end when either the bad guy has been defeated or there has been a change made to the world or to a way of living. This series accomplished both of that. Percy (but really Luke) beat the evil Kronos, and then he ordered the gods to claim all their children.<br /><br />Which is really the main theme of the books. Kronos never would have risen to power without the help of the half-bloods who felt dejected and unwanted. Because of that neglect, bad things happened, and Percy is determined that it doesn't happen again. The series is about acceptance and belonging, like all coming-of-age stories.<br /><br />The book was a brilliant end to the series. The only thing I'm not satisfied with is that Riordan never addressed Percy's Achilles's curse in the end of the book. Is Percy still invincible? Did it wear off? Maybe he mentioned it earlier in the book and I just didn't notice. But overall, everyone got a happy ending, and the very last sentence was just wonderful:<br /><br />\\"For once, I didn't look back.\\"The Last Hero and there's no Grover? Boo.)

1933633867|5.0|Graeber's book elegantly places current-day debt crises in the context of the whole history of social and economic transactions. The intellectual range is incredible: from Graeber's own anthropological fieldwork in Madagascar to usury in ancient Mesopotamia to the Biblical notion of jubilee to the fallacies somehow perpetuated in nearly every college economics class. Tying all this disparate material together in a lucid political and ethical framework, Graeber highlights the absurd way in which we now treat debt, and what that means for the state of our democracies, where promises made by politicians to bankers are so often held to a higher standard than promises made to constituents.
038572179X|5.0|Atonement by Ian McEwan is a novel about, well, a lot of things. The novel is split into four parts, each of which focuses on a different character and experience. It is set in the 1930's and 1940's, dealing with World War II and its effects. Briony Tallis is a young girl who makes a mistake that changes the lives of everyone around her forever.<br /><br />This book is wonderful. McEwan is a fantastic writer, and the story is engaging. I already knew how the book would end because I've seen the movie, but it was still a shock. Much of the book isn't even dialogue, but it hardly matters. McEwan allows you to get into the mind of each character that he narrates without saying anything trite like \\"Briony felt afraid.\\" The story never drags, and each words has a purpose. The book was interesting, funny, heartfelt, and heart-breaking.<br /><br />Part One, in my opinion, is clearly the superior part, especially for people who aren't that interested in the WWII aspect of the novel. This part is the longest section of the book, and it switches from narrator to narrator, all in third person. The reader gets to see several different perspectives from each main character, and some minor ones, and the plot is very interesting.<br /><br />Parts Two and Three focus more on the war effort, with Two being an account of Robbie in the war, and Three being the details of Briony's career as a nurse, and then how she finally fixes the problems with Robbie. Part Two was less interesting because it was mostly just Robbie (or Turner, as he is called in this part only, clearly showing the difference between someone in a war and someone not) running around and trying to get home. I liked Part Three. But then we get to Part Four and it's Briony explaining that the entire beginning was a novelization of her childhood, and that, actually, Robbie died in France and Cecilia died in the hospital. They never got their happy ending.<br /><br />The book's main theme is quite obviously atonement. Briony accused Robbie of raping her cousin when she was a little girl, and she spent the next five years trying to undo it. Personally, the book made me want to forgive everyone. Briony is struggling with her life because she feels guilt and she needs to be forgiven, but they refuse to give that to her. Briony's novel (aka Parts 1 through 3) ends with the opptimism of Briony being forgiven sometime in the future, but in Part 4 we realize that she was never forgiven. She had to live with the guilt that she separated a couple and that they never got their happy ending. Cecilia and Robbie never forgave Briony for what she did, which I think was kind of unfair. She was a child. But anyway...<br /><br />The book also tells about misinterpretation. Briony wants to believe that it was Robbie who raped Lola because she thinks he is a madman. She didn't understand Robbie's letter or the scene in the library. She tells the lie for so long that she really does believe it was Robbie who raped Lola. Once she realizes her mistake, it's too late to recant; she would look like a foolish child and no one would believe her. There are also smaller instances, like when Robbie remembers Briony confessing her love for him and believes she might have been jealous of his affections for Celilia, when in actuality Briony never thought about her crush again.<br /><br />The structure of the novel is beautiful, because the reader gets to enjoy the fictionalized tale first before being crushed with the reality. You read Briony's fictional version and get to think that all was made right: Celilia and Robbie got to be together, and Briony eventually gained everyone's forgiveness. Part 4 is necessary because it is real. People die, and sometimes forgiveness is never given. People hold grudges for life, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. But this book serves as a warning. Forgive those you love for their mistakes, or they will live with that guilt for the rest of their lives. It also shows thatpeople have to atone for their mistakes. Briony became a nurse to give back to the world, and she wrote her story to give Robbie and Celilia a happy ending they didn't get in real life.<br /><br />There is no villain in this story. There are only real characters in real situations with real consequences. The trick is to realize that everything you do will affect someone else, and to know that you will always have to atone for it. This book is marvelous.riony became a nurse to give back to the world, and she wrote her story to give Robbie and Celilia a happy ending they didn't get in real life.

B004LWZW24|5.0|I am very hard to please when it comes to horror movies. However, I must say that this movie is pure PERFECTION!!!!! It had me scared to go home after I saw it in theaters. I can't wait until it comes in the mail so I can see it again. I highly recommend that EVERY horror movie fanatic sees this film
B0041KKYEW|2.0|This movie was confusing. Portman played her role well however I did not like the ending. You wonder what happens to Portman. Then I was wondering who put the scratches on her back and how did she get hurt in the end. From this movie I got and agree that parents need to let there children grow up and decided what jobs they want to do in there life. There are parents who put pressure on there children to do the same job as them. For example if the parents are doctors then they want there children to be doctors,etc. I think this movie shows how stress and perfection affected Portman's character. Also, competition stressed Portman to push herself to get the dance of the Swan Princes down to perfection. I think this movie is showing a lesson of how stress and perfection can stress a person out and affect there mind. This movie also states that parents should let there children grow up and be who they want to be.
0553801473|3.0|Edit: finished the book a week ago.  I stand by everything I said.  I was really hoping for the second half to pick up, and it didn't, except for the one moment where the author went \\"OMG look!  Aren't you shocked?!!\\". But honestly by then, all of that character's chapters were so tedious and repetitious (an unfortunately common problem for this book), that I wanted to join in on what the bad guys did, just to make him stop boring me.<br /><br />[original review]:<br /><br />And after 15 years, GRRM is still the best writer I've come across for descriptive and character-development writing.  Mostly due to the prologue, I'm finally finding the whole warg thing less boring and seeing it less as pure new-agey mumble-jumble.  But my concern is I've read in places that the book really picks up momentum after the half-way mark?  So I still have another 20% of menu- and trip-planning to plod through before that happens?  Still, I really hope it does pick up, because so far I don't see anything happening other than \\"they had X stewed in Y for [insert meal here]\\" and \\"he [sailed/walked/went on horseback]\\" for yet another day.  It's like AFFC all over again, like I'm reading a travel book except the author only talks about sitting on the plane and brushing his teeth in airport hotels (or should I say pissing, because there really is an awful lot of urination in this book) rather than the destinations themselves...I'm squeezing time out of bar review to read this book, and I really hope there's going to be something more worthwhile.<br /><br />One little thing I'm absurdly happy about is that GRRM has really cut back on Lord Mormont's crow.  Man how I hated that stupid echoing crow.  Glad it doesn't say \\"corn corn corn corn corn corn corn corn\\" after every sentence anyone says anymore.

B004UUKDNA|5.0|Five stars.  Ten stars.  A hundred stars.  I regret giving five stars to anything in the past, because none of it approaches how mind-blowingly awesome this album is.    As others have said, Foster the People are masters of alternative/indie dance rock.  I've seen the comparisons to MGMT and Passion Pit, but this is so much more.  Those bands are midgets compared to this giant.  Every single song on this album is a hit, better than any hit by any band of this nature in recent memory.  Every.  Single.  Song.  The beats and hooks are simply unbelievable.    This album will make you dance until you pass out.  It will cheer you up when you are having the worst day of your life.  It will make you drive fast and scream along in public, embarrassing yourself.  If you listen to this in bed with headphones on, you will dance in your bed and wake up your significant other.    I am honestly grateful that this band exists and that I have found them.  I have not felt this way about music in a long time - possibly ever.  Buy this, and buy a copy for everyone you care about in the world.

B004WOS3P4|5.0|David Cook's appearances on AI were full of creativity, his amazing voice, and the artistic touches of someone with huge potential. I was interested to see what he'd do with this album, since his first one felt rushed and superficial compared to what it seemed he was capable of. \\"This Loud Morning\\" fulfills the promise by delivering an amazing set of songs. Cook's voice is quite an instrument, and he deploys it wisely and well throughout. It's a big voice, and sometimes his vowel sounds are stretched unnaturally by the scope of what he can sing, but that's also part of what makes him unique and identifiable, and I certainly don't object. \\"Goodbye to the Girl\\" is perhaps the song I'd recommend him to leverage into the future, with less stadium-sized singing and more intimate, careful navigation of a complex emotional terrain. He's proven his rock chops. Now, let's add more color and delicacy in future. But back to this album. It's a great listen the first time, and has gotten better with repetition. I find myself recalling the tunes throughout the day now. The arrangements definitely benefited from the extra work, and this is a theme album, as the repetition of the toy piano and glockenspiel as bookends attests. Great job, David Cook! And thanks!
B001AGXEAG|4.0|I enjoyed this movie when I was little and I was sure that my 11 year old would too. She likes it a lot. There are a couple of \\"insinuate\\" scenes where Beetlejuice creates an exotic club for himself (I completely forgot about) but overall it's a good movie with GREAT music/dance scenes
B004Y1USV2|4.0|Okay, I'm sure you've read all the other reviews by now, so I'll try really hard not to overdo this since I pretty much agree with most of the positives that have been said. If you are open minded enuff to accept that this is NOT Fragile, or Close To the Edge, or even 90125, and you are not bitter about the departures of Jon Anderson or Rick Wakeman, then you are ready to see this album for what it is. A tight, well-produced, slice of Progressive Pop with definite undertones of its roots in the \\"Drama\\" era. And to my ears, that's GREAT. I always LIKED \\"Drama\\" personally (Especially after it was reissued with all of the 'BONUS' material) and I became a huge fan of the Buggles because of that. You can definitely hear bits & pieces that recollect not only \\"Drama\\" but the other Trevor Horn produced Yes albums, as well as both of the Buggles discs and Asia's early releases. But there is also a lot of maturity, or more of a mellowing of the sound. And I'm okay with that. Let's face it, these guys are getting older and so are we the fans. All I know is that, in my opinion, this is the BEST thing they have done in a LONG time ... at least as a whole. While there have been High Spots in alot of Yes' recent Albums, I wouldn't call any of the albums \\"Great\\" as a whole. That's not to say that this is \\"Great\\" either ... but it is damned good & deserves at least a listen before you write it off for what it isn't or who is NOT here. Just enjoy it for what it IS ....

B004EPYZP8|5.0|THE LINCOLN LAWYER is a classy, well-written (adapted from Michael Connelly's novel by John Romano), well-directed (Brad Furman) drama that benefits from the presence of a well chosen, first class cast. This is one of the stronger movies of the year, the kind of film that reminds us of the art of cinema.<br /><br />Mike Haller (Matthew McConaughey in a brilliant performance) is a money hungry smarmy defense lawyer whose brilliant mind is bent toward representing sleazy types who pay well.  He works out of his Lincoln automobile driven by his trusted ally Earl (Laurence Mason), lives in a dumpy apartment, works with a shoddy appearing detective Frank (William H Macy), and spars with the beautiful fellow lawyer Maggie McPherson (Marisa Tomei) with whom he has a daughter and an on again off again relationship. One of his fellow workers Val Valenzuela (John Leguizamo) tips Mike on a case of  wealthy realtor Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe) who is accused of beating a prostitute: the case smells of lots of money so Mike of course takes it on - along with Louis, wealthy mother Mary Windsor (Frances Fisher) and the family lawyer Cecil Dobbs (Bob Gunton).  Mike's investigation turns up evidence that suggests his client is not the 'presumed innocent' he appears and there are connections between this case and an old case Mike handled - Jesus Martinez (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) - and Mike's usual 'go for the money' attitude takes a turn toward actually seeking justice in the courtroom. A shady dealing lawyer does actually have a conscience and finds a way to prove the truth will out.<br /><br />There are many cameo roles worthy of mentioning - Josh Lucas plays the prosecuting attorney Ted Minton, Pell James is Mike's girl Friday Lorna, Margarita Levieva is the victim prostitute Reggie Campo, Trace Adkins plays the motorcycle gang head Eddie Vogel, and Shea Whigham inhabits the role of the jail snitch DJ Corliss.  But the major attraction here is Matthew McConaughey's Oscar worthy role: he is magnetic in his transformation from a lawyer you want to loathe to a victor you want to hail.  Marisa Tomei is once again given the opportunity to demonstrate just how fine an actress she is. This is a fast moving, well-scripted film that is simply one of the better moves to come out in a while.  Highly recommended.

0679759328|4.0|Beautifully written, intelligent, reflective, understated and elegiac in tone, there is a pervading sadness that runs throughout this novella is the charming and thoughtful story about Edith Hope, a successful middle-aged novelist of romantic fiction.<br /><br />While she is pragmatic about the real world of the living, she never denies her fictional heroines the mythical joys of true romantic journeys and endings. She goes to stay at the genteel, select Hotel du Lac, an old world establishment in Switzerland, to reflect on recent events in her life. And, during her time there, Edith gets to know some of the hotel's colorful residents, all beautifully drawn.<br /><br />There's Monica, with her tiny dog that she passes her hotel food to. Monica has an eating disorder, and focuses mainly on cakes, coffee and cigarettes to keep her going - while vaguely thinking about her marriage that has come to an impasse.<br /><br />We encounter the relentlessly self-obsessed, rich, always-on-display and well-dressed, elegant Mrs Pusey and her shadow daughter, Jennifer (acting as truncated Greek Chorus to Mrs Pusey's endless exclamations about her own life and opinions).<br /><br />Then we have stalwart, sad, alone Mme de Bonneuil, dumped by her only son to live for part of each year at the hotel.<br /><br />And Mr Neville, charming, devilish, always insightful, but without sentiment or love, who intrigues Edith and is the catalyst for her to consider making fundamental changes in her life.<br /><br />He does this by questioning her mode of living and her way of thinking about love and relationships and self (he's an advocate of self-interested living only), and proposing marriage (but not love).<br /><br />Faced with a pattern and routine in her life that Edith finds both comforting and sad, including her affair with a married man, Mr Simmons, and for which she is typically pigeon-holed, she is regarded as less than she really is in terms of character and depth. Such conflicts act as catalysts that, combined, conspire to a decision that ultimately leads her to the Hotel du Lac.<br /><br />The dialogue and characterisation are consistently rich, entertaining and often provoke the reader into reflecting on his or her own approach to love and a life worth living, and what this says about ourselves. At the end of the novella, Edith's decision and next step, reflects her full awareness of her life to date, and the options available to her, including that of taking a radically different, perhaps more positive (self-interested) approach to her life, her decision is very much her own and true to who she is.<br /><br />A moving meditation on personal choices, love and life-changing decisions and ways of living.

B004132HZS|5.0|This is a wonderful update of Sherlock Holmes to the 21st Century.  It maintains the essence of Sherlock and John (although with a bit more humor).  Sherlock, of course, has no sense of humor and is self-obsessed.  John shows more frustration with Sherlock's behaviors.  John is very competent which is very nice.  They also do a nice job of overlaying the things that attract Sherlock on the screen.  A delightful and engaging romp.

B004LWZW2E|4.0|Let me start by saying I actually liked this movie, well I like most of this movie. The first 3/4 of this movie is genuinely suspenseful and at some points even scary. Unfortunately this movie, like many others in the genre, hits a major setback in the last act. It suffers an identity crisis! This movie becomes a huge mess of some of the best and mostly worst moments of Poltergeist, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Inception. I was disappointed with the way the movie turned out after such superb acting and the outstanding visuals throughout most of the film. Rose Byrne (I highly recommend two of her other movies Sunshine and Bridesmaids) who plays Renai did an excellent job making the fear believable which goes a long way in this kind of Paranormal Activity themed movie. These kind of movies are becoming more and more popular these days...you know the formula, 45 minutes of doors slamming unexplainably, dishes or other household items flying across the room or falling off shelves, strange voices being heard from upstairs, blurry or shadowy figures seen in windows or dark areas of hallways. Then there's the last 45 minutes where it gets more intense and things actually start happening. Overall, this method has proven effective and enjoyable.     Concering the technicle specs on the movie I have no complaints. The Blu Ray picture quality and sound on this movie is crisp and clear. The extras on the disc are worth watching.      Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I just had a tough time with the way the last 30 minutes went. It really dragged the movie down. The fire demon had a lot of potential, but ended up being comical rather than terrifying. I would suggest this movie to anyone that enjoys modern horror movies.
0226443221|5.0|In Heat Wave, the author presents a compelling and complex portrait of a natural and social disaster. Many of us might not think of a heat wave as a natural disaster in the way we think, say, of hurricanes or tornadoes or earthquakes. (I hadn't thought this way.) But in the U.S., as the author documents, heat waves have taken more lives than the other three events combined.<br /><br />The 1995 heat wave in Chicago was more than a natural disaster, it was a social disaster. It was social because many of the deaths could have been prevented, the author contends. Through a mix of historical research and interviews, the author shows how issues such as age, race, and economics affected those who lived, and those who died. The author is at his most compelling when he compares North Lawndale and South Lawndale. Although both communities are similar in terms of income, North Lawndale is primarily African American, while South Lawndale is primarily Hispanic. The death rates in North Lawndale were significantly higher than in South Lawndale during the heat wave, and the author presents an extensive study of what might have caused that. He even goes so far as to compare the abilities of small, independent churches (prevalent in North Lawndale) and large, Roman Catholic churches (prevalent in South Lawndale) to look after parishioners.<br /><br />What emerges from the author's extensive research is a complex portrait. Through his research, he brings in numerous players, not only community members but experts from the fields of medicine, politics, science, and journalism. This book is worth reading not only for understanding how a heat wave could kill over 700 people but also for understanding how citizens, politicians, scientists, journalists, and others are likely to react to natural disasters.
B0042MEQVG|2.0|While the movie seems to be perfectly good, the cover looks like a reproduction.  It doesn't look like a store copy/original copy.  There is nothing inside the jacket, no booklet, papers, etc.  This was purchased for my daughter as part of her collection and she wasn't happy with the packaging.  All in all it's good for a copy just to view.
B004Y1USJE|4.0|Being a fan of the band since the early 70's, I pre-ordered a copy of \\"Fly From Here\\" when I saw the band was releasing a new album.  After two listenings (on a car audio system), I would have to say that I am not disappointed.   The album combines a pop-sensibility, influenced by Trevor Horn's production and writing style, with the longer song-style of the classic Yes era.  Don't expect a the same plunge into the enlightened world of \\"Tales of Topographic Oceans\\", though.  This album is different from the 70's Yes, yet still  combines crafty pop  songwriting style with the all the instrumental breaks that Yes fans have grown to enjoy.  The recognizable rhythm section of Alan White and Chris Squire and the texture of the layering of both electric and acoustic guitars by Steve Howe are all there.   Geoff Downes' although quite different in style from Rick Wakeman adds his own creative voice to the keyboard.       \\"Fly From Here\\", although a longer piece with six individual movements, has several parts that could stand up well as radio-playable singles.  Although I really do wish Jon Anderson could have contributed to this album, I think Benoit David's voice adds a new dimension to the sound which is not strictly a copy of Anderson's vocals.  The vocals actually remind more of the Drama-era sound of Yes when Trevor Horn was with the band.    I enjoyed this Album.  Maybe some Yes fans will not think it is as good as the classic  \\"Close to the Edge\\",  \\"Tales of Topographic Oceans\\", \\"Fragile\\" or \\"The Yes Album\\", but those were really monumental achievements of the prog-rock era that are really hard to surpass.  This new record stands well on it's own in a new time and a place.
0316098329|5.0|Wow. A desolating, overwhelming story, strangely uplifting at the same time.     Meet 5-year-old Jack. He lives in Room with his Ma and no one else. All the rest is... Outer Space. Except for Old Nick who comes by almost every evening to stay with Ma while Jack is sleeping in Wardrobe. Jack and Ma do not like Old Nick, but there is nothing to be done about that...     Little Jack's voice is poignant, almost funny at times and we read the story through his eyes, words, innocence and love for his mother. Innocence and ignorance are what protect him from the evil of his living condition, although his mother does her best to raise him in an impossible-to-imagine situation. \\"Room\\" is the only reality he has ever known.     And then... page after page I was eager to know what could possible happen, if at all possible, to change that kind of life... The author was just great to convey certain feelings and emotions and oh, what a lovely character Jack is. And his Ma. Courageous, tenacious, desperate Ma.     Every object in Jack's world has a capital letter (Room, Table, Chair etc) conveying the sense of belonging, and even contentment, to such place; the capital letters are a writing technicality that add depth to the story. Jack is a wonderful narrator and the story will keep you glued to the pages. Extremely well done to the author.

B000F0UUIM|5.0|John Wayne, the duke. That really should say it all, but since that probably wont fly, I'll pontificate further. From the opening shot, a door being open and through it seeing the wide, open red desert, you know you're in for an old school western treat. I first saw this film not that long ago, probably around Christmas, 2010. It was AMC, and I decided to sit down with a pizza in the freezing cold and watch it. I was, to say the least, AMAZED. At sixteen, I'd never really seen a John Wayne film, as sad as that is, its true. My dad's always been a huge fan, but I was never able to get into the old westerns, that is, until I saw this one. Wayne's performance as the bigoted Ethan reminded me so much of the people I'd see and meet, hard shelled, soft centered. A real anti-hero, and a fabulous performance. I live in California by the way, Central Valley, Nor Cal, and what I mean by him reminding me of people I know if, is well, some of my fellow Caucasians are well-meaning morons, I've been around many that just constantly insult the Hispanic population around here, which just makes them dislike us in general even more, a vicious cycle if there ever was one. Anyway, I could relate to the young character of Martin, perhaps the moral character of the story, trying to hold back the old ways, trying to keep justice from becoming in-justice, just faced in the opposite direction. The characters all seem so real, even after fifty years, and many changes in the styles of film acting, John Wayne still holds his ground for me. And I have, yes, grown to love many a John Wayne film, from Rio Bravo to The Sons of Katie Elder, is, most definitely, in my top twenty favorite actors. The story itself revolves around Ethan and Martin trying for over ten years to find a girl who was kidnapped by a group of Comanche, who also slaughtered and raped the girls parents and siblings. The real greatness of this film is the interactions between Wayne and Jeffery Hunter(Martin), and how, at the endof the film, Wayne's character, Ethan, does change into a better, less bigoted and prejudiced man. The only thing that I could see from the film that could have been better, or perhaps just enhanced the film, would be the final act, I felt like it ended too quickly and happily, though I think it DOES work, I almost do wish that it ended more grimly, and that the film had more of the somber elements that are found through out, but, as it lies, it is a grand and wonderful film.

B000WC3864|5.0|I'm pretty sure I cant say anything NEW about this film that my drones of fellow horror film fanatics haven't already said, but heck, why not try? My dad first introduced me to the Evil Dead series when I was about ten years old, back in '04 or '05. I'd never seen a Sam Raimi film, except for the Spider Man films. Since I left the womb I'd been watching horror films, I remember being like eight years old and skimming the racks in my small video store for the weirdest, craziest horror film I could find, sometimes renting crap, and other times renting insane and awesome movies like Saw 1(I dont care for the other Saw movies) or stuff like Cabin Fever. Yes, I watched movies like this in my prime youth, well, maybe not eight, but like ten or eleven. But when my dad popped in his old VHS of Evil Dead 2, I didn't like it, in fact, I thought it was retarded. Wait! Dont pull those triggers yet, fire squad, let me explain. I was ten, okay? I didn't get, nor was I fan at the time of campy films. But then a year or two later, I saw Evil Dead on IFC. THAT changed my view FOREVER on horror films. I was amazed by it, the cinematography, its complete and absolute awareness of what it was, and what it wanted to be, Bruce Campbell, oh, what a sexy beast, and the forest rape scene! Come on! It was hilarious, out there, insane, crazy, scary, and just fun. It was a thrill ride, and I knew I had discovered something amazing. I went back and watched Evil Dead 2, and finally liked it. In fact, I loved *it* as well, not nearly as much as Evil Dead, but still loved it. Then I saw Army of Darkness, and well, lets just say when I first saw AoD, I crapped myself in the wake of its awesomeness. Evil Dead is one of those films that, if I'm having a late night horror film marathon, which I have like, once every four weeks or so, it has to go first, second, or last. In front, after Re-Animator, or just after Hills Have Eyes(original, remake sucked). Its one of those films thats not only just a grand tour de force in horror, but also inspiring, and lets you realize that you too could make films, you just need the right ingredients for the meal. :)
B00544L9EI|5.0|Worthy of 5 stars based on the two last tracks alone, Living Proof and Echo, with the icing being Fast Lane, I'm On Everything, and Take From Me.  The other songs aren't bad, they're just not as good.  The Slaughterhouse track, Loud Noises, has some decent verses, I just haven't gotten into it for some reason.  The Reunion, Above The Law, and Kiss Kiss weren't instantly likable and may just need more time.  I also have to think Lighters was only put on to attract Bruno Mars fans.<br /><br />Another reason I rated this album 5 stars is due to Marshall and Ryan being able to squash their beef and link up again after more than a decade later and pick up right where they left off.  I hope they had fun making this album because it sure sounds like they did.  It makes me wonder what could have been if it was Royce instead of or in addition to 50 Cent or Obie Trice.  No disrespect to either of them, they both have talent and use what they have to the best of their ability, but Royce is on a different level.<br /><br />I've been a Royce Da 5'9\\" fan since the first time I heard him on Bad Meets Evil from the Slim Shady LP.  Some people consider Em's verses from Renegades to be the best verses he ever wrote and if that's true, I like to think that was at least partly due to the quality of his original track partner, Royce.  Consider what Eminem put out early on in his career and then imagine what his verses would have been like with a sparring partner like Royce around too.  I don't know what happened, but with tracks like I'm The King, The Throne Is Mine, Won't Be, Take His Life, We're Live (Danger), Boom, All I Wanna Do, Nickel Nine Is, and countless others I don't see how any decent label couldn't make Royce a household name.<br /><br />As for Eminem, what can I say, he's one of my favorite artists regardless and surprised me with Recovery last year after not really listening to him since The Eminem Show.  I don't really have much to say about his effort here except that he came through once again.  If I have any critique, it's the hope (in general) for more Recovery-type and Airplanes Part 2-type verses rather than Bagpipes From Baghdad-type verses.  And Relapse wasn't ALL bad, Deja Vu and Beautiful are alright and maybe Crack A Bottle just for a laugh.<br /><br />Keep up the good work guys.n.

B005869U6G|5.0|I see there are quite a few people upset about this cd because it isn't what we are used to from Incubus and you immediately write it off. Well I'm here to say that if you listen to this with an open mind, it's just as creative, original, and interesting, if not more, than their previous releases, even though it is a bit softer. But just because it's softer doesn't mean its any less beautiful musically. So go at with an open mind, and feel refreshed. I love this cd, the whole thing.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I was skeptical of the book because I read reviews here before purchasing it. I am glad I decided to!    Let's start off with the obvious. You will not be reading much about Jon Snow nor much about Tyrion nor much about Bran and Rickon.    What this book does is spend a good deal more time on the peripheral developments in Westeros. Namely those of the Iron Islands, the Tullys, the Freys, The Vale, Brave Companions and notable characters such as Samwell Tarly, Jamie Lannister and Cersei Lannister. If these characters and houses offer very little interest then you probably won't like the book much. I would urge you to read however as they become very interesting stories as the book nears a close. I almost feel depressed that A Dance with Dragons will not be resuming some of these wonderful stories but that is for another book!

I think as fans we should do the same. These guys are so talented, they had to at least try it once! Get past the resentment and give a great band a chance.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|This series really is an extraordinary pleasure.  While the HB Prince and Order P were a bit of a blur, this film is completely distinctive - it doesn't take place in HogW and is a running adventure chase in full, with many principal characters killed off.  It moves much faster, the dangers seem far greater, and everything is at stake.  This is even character development, with Ron rebelling and coming back, the progress of young love, and Harry's flaws coming out more clearly.  After so much time, it amazes me that the quality is still going up.  The comic touches, depth of theme, and fine acting continue, of course.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.
B00005N6KG|4.0|This earphone arrived in 3 days free delivery.  The sound clarity is good, sound quality towards the high frequency part with lacks of bass if compared to my other earphones of the same size driver.  Since it is super light, I didn't feel much pressure on my ears at all while it is snug in the ear.  It should be good for listening especially when exercising where strong body movement are expected.

B000F0UUIM|5.0|In a million years I never would have thought that I would love a John Wayne Western movie, UNTIL I saw The Searchers on Turner Classic Movies about a year ago.  John Wayne blew all my stereotypes about him away after seeing this movie.  I had to have this Anniversy Edition DVD.   I've also followed other John Ford Westerns after falling in love with The Searchers. His use of cinematography and gift of story-telling are very recognizable in films that I previously thought were outdated and irrelevant. For those who may not be very fond of westerns, The Searchers might change your point of view like it did mine.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I just finished reading Jaycee Dugard's book. This is by far, one of the most heartbreaking and haunting books I have ever read. After watching her interview on ABC several days ago, I decided this book was a must read. The book is graphic, descriptive, and painful. That said, it is also beautiful in parts. Jaycee's experience is so horrific, it is almost unbelievable, and I can't even imagine the strength it must have required for her to put it on paper. I want to personally thank her for telling her story. She is an inspirational and amazing human being.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I'm not a music reviewer, but my impression is that Florence has taken many influences and distilled them into something uniquely her own.  I love the drama, moodiness and power of their songs, each of which are unique.  I haven't loved a new band so much since I first heard U2 in the 1980's.  I predict Florence and the Machine will be around for a while.
030726999X|5.0|In this third and final book of the famous Stieg Larsson series that began with \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", Larsson takes us even further into Lizbeth Salander's background, and we follow the fight by all who care for her to free her from the conspiracy that she's become central in and to right some of the injustices that have been perpetrated upon her for much of her life.  While there was one part of this third book that I found rather dry (the chapter in which Larsson goes into the whole history of the Swedish justice system and police divisions), it was for the most part another riveting and suspense-packed read.  It's sad that we won't see more books in this series.  Larsson was a brilliant writer!

1451629184|5.0|This book is very difficult to read in certain parts - but I was not able to put down.  I cried for the little girl and I am cheering for the woman she turned out to be, despite the monsters who took her.  What a story of survival!  I always wondered why children who had been abducted stayed with the captors even when they had a chance to leave, and through her amazing telling of her story and her journals I believe I can understand.  Her amazing story has made me take stock of my life and \\"freedom\\" and wonder what I could be doing to live my life to the fullest!  Thank you Jaycee for letting us into your world and showing us even in the most horrible situations, there is always hope!
B003XURDAY|4.0|Blade Runner(released June/82-has it been that long?)has been re-released onto DVD and this time around Ridley Scott himself has supervised the remastering,tweaking several scenes and boosting the background sound/music.The movie has never looked as good as this....ever.This release's major drawback however is the removal of Ford's background narration throughout,which certainly detracts from Scott's original vision but,like Spielberg,Lucas,et al,they can and do do what they want with their product.I must admit that even with the loss of the voice track,this version IS quite compelling and makes for an excellent comparison between the original cut and this one.<br />The story is well known by now.It is 2019 and Deckard(Harrison Ford)is a cop dedicated to the elimination of Replicants.These androids,built by the Tyrell Corporation,are on an equal par in many respects with humans and as a result have been banned to the outer worlds as workers.However a group of Replicants rebelled and some made their way back to Earth and into Deckards path.One by one Deckard hunts them down.Deckard even meets with the great Tyrell himself and falls in love with one of his personal Replicants who doesn't know she is one until Deckard reveals the truth to her(Sean Young).The rogue Replicants are paired down eventually to two(played by Darryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer) who visit one of Tyrell's valuable assistants,who in turn persuade him to take them to the inventor.The inventor projects a kind of a cautious fatherly attitude towards his inventions,whose main objective is to find out how long they have to live(they have a built in safeguard life span of about four years into them)and to stop the process.It seems there isn't a way to reverse the dying process in the Replicants and Tyrell is summarily killed.<br />Two Replicants are whittled to one and Deckard tracks him down,but it becomes a chase to live for Deckard,as he becomes the prey instead of the hunter.The Replicant at times plays with Deckard knowing his own inevitable end is near and before he can make the coup de gras he indeed dies.Deckard returns to his apartment where he and Tyrells Replicant leave the city forever.<br />This film moves along very well,telling its story in measured increments,never losing ground at any time.The entire look of the city from the flying cars to the giant advertising boards to the rainy and grungy streets have been more than a huge influence to countless films and filmmakers since its release.Scott was on a definite hot streak at this time as his Alien film was and has been a terribly big influence also.The acting from everyone involved is fantastic and was a break through film for many of its participants.<br />Technically the film looks absolutely gorgeous and it is in its widescreen a/r.Other than extensive commentaries by Scott and several production crew members,that is all the extras there is.<br />All in all a highly recommended release.If the  Deckard commentary had have been there I would have given this film a BIG five stars all the way.However despite its' deletion,the film is still excellent in this form,and through Scott's tweaking,it has come through as a close second to the original.eckard knowing his own inevitable end is near and before he can make the coup de gras he indeed dies.Deckard returns to his apartment where he and Tyrells Replicant leave the city forever.

B000063DFS|3.0|I tend to praise this album pretty heavily when I talk about it.  Zakk Wylde was let off his chain much more, his hyper shredding, his pinch harmonic driven sound still haunts Ozzy to this day.  It's actually funny now to listen to new Ozzy albums, because even though Zakk has been long gone, Ozzy's writers and session guitarists are still trying to copy this sound on here.  That is actually quite an achievement when you consider the fact that the Randy Rhoads was the one that defined Ozzy Osbourne as a solo artist, and was essentially responsible for putting Ozzy back in the spotlight.  As for the quality of the songs on here, it is quite hit or miss.  \\"Mr Tinkertrain\\" has a whammy bar bending, squealing, intro and a powerful pinch harmonic driven riff.  \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home\\" displays Zakk's southern styled guitar wizardy to great effect.  \\"No More Tears\\" is quite literally one of the heaviest riffs known to man, which is ironic considering this is one of the most squeaky clean albums in the metal genre.  Why the three star rating after such praise you might be thinking?  After the riff filled \\"S.I.N\\", the album spirals downhill until the final track \\"Road To Nowhere\\" closes the album off in decent fashion.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I have my work and home calendar's on it as well as two other family member's calendars. It's easy to navigate and view anything happening on any day and open the item for editing. I like that the 'Save' button stays in view while scrolling down through the fields of the event. Great app that I highly recommend.
B00005K9LK|3.0|Judas Priest were a bit of an enigma throughout most of the 80's.  They were equally repugnant and inviting in their song writing habits.  They had honed in the art of making successful commercial songs and were exploiting this tendency with mixed results.  \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\" for me falls into the category of a tired and boring failure.  On the flip side of the coin the one two punch of \\"Hellion\\" and \\"Electric Eye\\" could easily serve as a noteworthy introduction to the band if you had never heard them before.  \\"Riding on the Wind\\" is a personal favorite of mind, a song that tends to get lost in discussions of great Priest songs due to the bands massive catalog.  \\"Bloodstone\\" has a really cool opening guitar riff.  Devil's Child even sounds a bit like an AC/DC song.  When speaking on behalf of the hit or miss nature of the band throughout the 80's songs like \\"Pain and Pleasure\\" and \\"(Take These) Chains\\" become perfect fodder.  Even the title track \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" fails to inspire even a twitch of interest.  Once you have gotten your hands on all of the 70's Judas Priest albums, tread into the 80's with caution, they had already begun their descent from greatness.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Frankly I don't know what to write because I'm so blown away. Jaycee Dugard survived an unimaginable crime against her and her daughters and her entire family. After reading her book in one day it appears to me she did so with grace and integrity. Her kindness and spirit overcame her torment and her torturers. The Garridos should rot in prison and suffer every moment of the rest of their disgusting lives. However, the book I read didn't harbor thoughts of revenge, Jaycee is better than that. What a true heroine she is and I wish her all the best. Her book is a testament to life and survival and cherishing what good you can under extremely severe conditions. I hope everyone reads it and is inspired to cherish every freedom.
B00069YE0W|5.0|If I didn't have a family and didn't have to work or eat or bathe or sleep, I would just listen to 'Anne' over and over again. I never tire of it. I listen to other music but then I miss his humming here, like another reviewer said, as if he is next to you singing in your ear. Which is my greatest fantasy. (that, and actually being able to create amazing music like this)<br />The other songs -- like 'Ascension' and 'The Past Recedes' -- are fantastic too, but 'Anne', that one haunts me in my sleep. The guitar solo, that's the cry of any tormented heart. The lyrics are poetry, allegory, honesty. It's July 2011, you've been keeping quiet, and I miss you, John Frusciante.

The liners notes this time are again by noted writer PETER DOGGETT (Record Collector magazine) but with contributions from Ray Davies, Dave Davies and Mick Avory of the band. There’s photos of the UKalbum artwork including the legendarily rare 'Queen Victoria' insert that only came with original copies. There’s lovely colour repros of rare Euro and US 7&#34; single picture sleeves, trade adverts, newspaper clippings, memorabilia, lyrics to all the songs and there’s even input from fan sites etc. The breakdown of the tracks is very well done too - what came from what and why. Both of the discs are also themed - the CDs reflect the light blue and black colouring of the original UK Pye Records LP label - with Side 1 pictured beneath the see-through tray of CD1 and Side 2 beneath the tray of CD2 - all nice touches.<br /><br />ANDREW SANDOVAL, DAN HERSCH (of Digiprep and Rhino fame) and ANDY PEARCE carried out the remasters - and the sound quality is exceptionally good. The STEREO mix in particular is STUNNING – leaping out of the speakers in a way it never did before - beautifully clear. And for American fans who’ve only ever grown up with the Stereo mix on Reprise Records, the MONO variant on Disc 1 will come as a brutal shock. It makes a lot of the songs somehow bleaker, more focused – it’s hard to describe, but I like it. In fact - as with &#34;Face To Face&#34; and &#34;Something Else&#34; - the difference between the MONO and STEREO variants is acute, but never more so than here. Some prefer the stark power of the MONO mix – others the spread of the STEREO version - but this is definitely one of those 'Deluxe Editions' that actually benefits from the presence of both. They’re different beasts for sure - but equally admirable.<br /><br />To the record itself – somehow &#34;Arthur…&#34; seemed to sense that the Sixties were coming to a close, but not on a high note. A lot of the lyrics aren’t so much acidic as ponderous as to what the future was going to bring – &#34;…Now I’ve got children, I’m going grey…&#34; from &#34;Nothing To Say&#34; (lyrics above also) or &#34;I see the lines across your face - Time has gone and nothing can replace - Those great, so great - Young and innocent days…&#34; from the slightly sad &#34;Young And Innocent Days&#34; (a band favourite).  The zippy album opener &#34;Victoria&#34; is fabulous as is the layered &#34;Drivin'&#34; – very Kinks – very good. &#34;Shangri La&#34; is pretty yet biting, while the lyrics to &#34;Mr. Churchill Says&#34; now sound ever so slightly disrespectful and even revolutionary. The guitars on the finisher &#34;Arthur&#34; are so clear too…<br /><br />Niggles – couple of B-sides left off (but they’re available elsewhere if you really want them) and I find these new card-digipaks easy to dent and mark without the outer plastic wrap that was on all initial Deluxe Editions. But these are minor points - at a whopping 42 tracks and with full playing times on both discs, there’s genuinely very little to moan about.<br /><br />To sum up - a superb new remaster on both mixes, properly upgraded packaging and liner notes and extra tracks that actually warrant the title 'bonus'. Recommended like Princess Marina's hat…ts, newspaper clippings, memorabilia, lyrics to all the songs and there’s even input from fan sites etc. The breakdown of the tracks is very well done too - what came from what and why.

0553801473|5.0|I loved reading A Dance with Dragons, but I certainly did not always enjoy it. In fact, certain parts of the book are so dark they defy the imagination. Defenders of the darkness of the A Song of Ice and Fire series have often compared the books' grittiness to the evil of our own reality. But the world that sprang forth from the mind George R. R. Martin is perhaps even darker than our own miserable planet. Various parts of the book brought forth to mind the horrors of events such as the pestilence of the Black Death, or the cannibalistic doom of the Donner Party, or the psychopathic serial killer Robert Hansen. Seemingly all of the misery that human minds can recall from our wretched history has been marshaled into this single tome.<br /><br />Fans of George R.R. Martin's entire oeuvre will recognize that Martin's hallmark is a fascination with broken, corrupt, and decaying worlds. Throughout his fiction are found worlds that have once tasted grandeur, but have rotted away through the efforts of both time and humanity. The world of A Song of Ice and Fire is no different. Its lands are filled with ruined cities, extinct civilizations, and scattered peoples who squabble over memories.<br /><br />Perhaps it is fair that some question why these books should even be called fantasy when they might just as well be labeled as horror? Some of the passages from A Dance with Dragons are far more horrific than anything Hollywood has produced, perhaps ever. But I totally disagree with the notion that fantasy cannot be horrific as well. Too long have we suffered fantasy literature that dwells endlessly in shining castles. Soon enough, the grand castles, gleaming swords, and sage wizards become bland without some truly horrific stuff to spice it all up. Martin provides us with the spices we all crave. They may burn our mouths when we eat them, but once we have tasted them, we crave them. Not everyone can handle spicy food, and not everyone can handle fantasy books filled to the brim with rape, torture, mutilation, cannibalism, and all the other unpleasantries of life.<br /><br />Even if it can be a little dark, A Dance with Dragons is definitely the most magical and fantastical of the books so far. Bran's portion of the story alone was wonderful to read and would probably have made for a great children's fantasy if not for all the the violence. With the return of dragons to the world, magic and sorcery have been let loose, but never do they overwhelm the human elements of the story. Even the sorceress Melisandre misinterprets her visions and resort to cheap tricks to fool her audience.<br /><br />Another valid criticism of A Dance with Dragons might be that it is not as tightly wound as the first three books were. But it is a criticism that is only valid if one does not consider the narrative structure of the series as a whole. The series began with almost every character of note gathered at Winterfell. Through the many infamous twists and turn of the books, the story has become shattered like a crystal vase smashed into the ground. One cannot give readers so much thrilling death and destruction as Martin did in the first three books without breaking a lot of vases. But what death caused, death can also cure. Many smaller characters died off in A Dance with Dragons, and the pace will probably accelerate through The Winds of Winter.<br /><br />It is valuable to remember that Martin has always loved telling short stories set in his broken worlds. And he could not resist inserting some small stories for secondary characters into A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons. The skeptic will use these as evidence that Martin has \\"lost control of his narrative.\\" I prefer to describe this tendency as \\"just plain awesome.\\" The Chicago Sun-Times once said that A Game of Thrones is \\"an absorbing combination of the mythic, the sweepingly historical, and the intensely personal.\\" Where A Feast for Crows was abound with the personal, it lacked the epic portion of the formula. A Dance with Dragons made the personal stories epic in and of themselves.<br /><br />The book isn't perfect. Martin uses some phrases and words too freely and repetitively. I don't think we've seen the words niello, neeps, or serjeant before in the series, but they show up again and again throughout the book in multiple diverse contexts. The inner thoughts of many characters consists of the same phrases repeated many times over. It's effective but definitely not subtle.<br /><br />To be sure, those who scoff at the old chestnut that \\"The journey is more important than the destination\\" will surely dislike this book. A Song of Ice and Fire is in many ways like the river journey of Tyrion Lannister or that of Abner Marsh in Martin's own Fevre Dream or that of Charles Marlow in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. That is to say, it is a journey into the darkness of the human soul. A Dance with Dragons is but a leg of that journey, offering scant resolution, but heaps of oppressive doom. The coming winter described so vividly in the novel is but a reflection of the descent of the humans of the novel into a self-imposed hell of hatred, fear, hunger, and death.<br /><br />Those hoping for more resolution in The Winds of Winter may get some, but those hoping for some light at the end of the tunnel will be sorely disappointed, just as they were very likely disappointed in this book. This story can only grow even darker as winter comes in all its fury. I predict that those squeamish of reading about cannibalism will be made ill by the next book. We all know Martin loves detailed descriptions of foodstuffs, and eating each other seems to be the only hope of making it to A Dream of Spring for many of the people of Westeros. How do wights' livers taste? Probably not too bad with some neeps and a nice Arbor red.

1451629184|5.0|I remember receiving a phone call from one of my friends who lives in California, this was the day Jaycee Dugard was found. My heart sank ...I experienced joy and sadness. It was bitter sweet. I am so glad that she is back with her mom and her family. I am also so angry that she went through such a horrible experience, and wasn't saved sooner.     Jaycee is so brave, beautiful and courageous. I am very proud of her. I was glued to the television set watching her 2 hour special on Prime Time, immediately after that I ordered her \\"a stolen life \\" (a memoir) and the Pinecone necklace from the JAYC  foundation as I will wear this with PRIDE.    Her book will not disappoint anyone, we will put her in our prayers and be thankful she was able to tell her story as we all can learn from it. Jaycee is a very Smart and Positive girl and I wish her the BEST of success in her life. It is never too late. I can only hope that many other missing and abducted children will be found alive.  May all the victims of crime find peace!  Sincerely,  Diana Trepkov  Certified Forensic Artist  Author of Faceless, Voiceless.

B0000028WD|4.0|I'm was just poking around on the internet and ended up reading the reviews to a record (cd) that I own and enjoy listening to.  I agree with the favorable comments.  It's a pretty good little taste of legends in popular music covering a songwriter legend's stuff.    I was particularly in agreement with the several observations about everyone having different favorites on this cd.  Tom Petty and License to Kill stays with me for days after listening.  Willie Nelson is great.  Lou Reed, Johnny Winter, Colvin, Carpenter, and Cash....really good.  So are several others.    I like Bob Dylan.  I'm old enough to have been listening since he first started.  I own several of his vinyl albums and cds, going back a long time.  I know his place in history.  But I don't think he's always a great performer of his own music.  Listening to someone else cover his stuff, and enjoying it, helps me appreciate Dylan's talent.  He wrote some killer songs.

I've since upgraded to the Fiio E17 for my Beyerdynamic DT 880s, as the E5 wasn't sufficient. But while I did use it, I was quite pleased with it.<br /><br />Maybe this will be most helpful. Who is this amplifier for?<br />-People who want more powerful sound from their satellite speakers (ex. Cyber Acoustics 3602, as mentioned below)<br />-People who have cheap-to-decent headphones; no, trendy fashion headphones are not decent, and this probably won't make much of a difference<br />-People who want to dabble in high quality audio without dropping loads of cash (for now...)<br /><br />_______________________________________________________________<br /><br />I purchased this headphone amp because I always felt that my music was kind of lacking. I'm only 15, and have no audiophile system or anything, I just use my iPod, so I'm sure anyone that listens with an iPod can relate. Anyways, I have Sennheiser hd203 headphones that I got for $20, and they're actually pretty great - it's just that the iPod couldn't push them at all. I had to really try to hear small details and the bass was weak.<br /><br />So out of the box, this thing's battery was charged, and I put it to use at once. I immediately noticed the warmer quality of sound, and could hear details without trying. I can distinguish the attack and decay of almost any bass, whether it's drum, guitar, or synth. It really is better sound quality, but remember it only improves the sound on higher quality headphones, not junky earbuds or headsets.<br /><br />It comes with all the cables you'll need, and a y-splitter that I can't get to work worth a crap. Which is my only complaint, but really, it was just a little extra thing that didn't even need to come with the amp, so I don't care. Some people say the bass boost switch is a little flimsy, and it sort of is, but I don't foresee any problems with it unless I try to break it. I usually just leave it on bass boost anyways, so there's no need to use it.<br /><br />All in all, if you use an iPod or other mp3 player to drive your high quality headphones and don't want to spend over $30 on some big, bulky \\"portable\\" amp (this one truly is portable, it even clips on to your pants or whatever), buy the fiio e5!<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I've found that when I hook this up to my cyber acoustic 3602 speakers, it cleans up the sound a LOT! Especially the bass.. if I really turned up the volume on some hip hop songs with my iPod, the bass would get kind of muddy, but now the sub produces clean bass at really loud volumes, and I'm surprised at the sound that's now coming out of this 30 watt system.
B001OB4ZSW|1.0|I've just wasted my time ordering this for the second time, and for the second time NOT receiving the disc as described.  BOTH discs that I received were PAL, NOT NTSC, and were NOT PLAYABLE on my DVD players.  The music is incredible, as is the video (I've viewed it on my computer).  I just wish I could watch it on my TV.
0345529057|5.0|I ordered this set because I read my daughter's book, first in the series.   I haven't yet opened up my set (removed the cellophane) since I will ignore everything else in my life when I do.  The author's content and writing style is that heady.
B004RE29WW|2.0|The only real problem with Alien 3 is that it should never have been made. 20th Century Fox was greedy and made this disaster. There is really nothing good about this film. The charactors are unlikable. The story is far to simple and claustrophobic. A simple way to kill off all the survivors of the 2nd film. Why not stop with Aliens. An academy award winning hit that was superior to the original. A film that launched director James Cameron to super director status (and Titanic and Avator). The only redeeming qualities of this film is that it looks good, has decent actors, and the special effects are good. The story is horrible. And the ending (spoiler alert), is Sigourney Weaver playing Joan of Arc. Sorry, no second oscar for this performance. In fact, no oscars for anything in this mess. The only reason I gave this clunker 2 stars instead of one is the redeeming qualities I talked about. If you have never seen this film, your lucky. Do yourself a favor and stay away. Remember, in space no one can hear you scream, unless you saw this movie.
1586487981|5.0|The authors identify three major approaches to dealing with world poverty, suggest that whatever their virtues and faults, there is a very piecemeal and pragmatic approach through which significant gains can be made without addressing the systemic obstacles identified by the three approaches. Their analysis is brilliant, focused, rooted in first-rate data sets, yet rich in social detail and anecdotal vignettes. I believe there are probably right, and their approach deserves to be widely studied an evaluated by policy makers in the advanced and developing countries.<br /><br />The dominant school of thought is probably the supply-side theory, most visibly represented by Jeffrey Sachs (the authors call him a \\"supply wallah\\"). According to this theory, the poor are poor because they lack money and resources, and there is a \\"poverty trap\\" such that investment in productive technologies must be very large in order to have a positive and sustainable effect. Because poor individuals, and even poor countries, lack the capacity to finance such investments, they are trapped in a low-level economic equilibrium. For this reason, Sachs and the supply theorists advise that the rich countries transfer a large lump-sum amount of money to a poor country, so it can get over the poverty-trap hump.<br /><br />A second salient school of thought is the demand-side theory, represented by William Easterly and many others. Demand-siders (the authors call them \\"demand wallahs\\") believes that the poor are poor because they do not want to undertake what would be necessary to move out of poverty and there is no poverty trap. Thus, if you throw money and resources to the poor, they consume it immediately rather than using it for long-term betterment.<br /><br />The third school of thought is the corruption school, represented by Acemoglu and Robinson, as expounded in the book Why Nations Fail. According to this theory, countries remain poor because their governments are predatory, exploiting the citizenry by refusing to make investments in productive infrastructure, by direction all profits to cronies, and by permitting rampant corruption that renders creative entrepreneurship unprofitable. According to this school, to which I admit to being very favorable, the supply wallahs are wrong because the resources throw into the system will be appropriate by the rich and powerful, and the demand wallahs are wrong because the poor are actively maintained by the oligarchy in their position of servitude.<br /><br />The authors are very insightful and balanced in presenting the views of these three schools and the evidence that supports these various positions. They also clearly explain their mutual critiques. For instance, the supply wallahs claim that states are predatory and corruption is rampant only because the country is so poor, and the demand wallahs claim that when the people want to move out of poverty, they will reform their governments. I find these defenses of supply and demand wallahs rather tendentious, leaving the corruptions school as the overall most plausible school.<br /><br />I think it is fair to say that Banerjee and Duflo have little sympathy for demand and supply wallahs, but considerable respect for the corruption theory. Their own position is that there are virtually always ways to productively intervene to pull a significant fraction of people out of poverty. The authors, who have collected huge amounts of data and interviewed many poor people from around the world, make the following argument.<br /><br />Most important, the poor in a poor country have about the same array of preferences and capacities as that of the human population as a whole, and humans are substantively rational in making decisions that affect their lives. However, the poor have a lot fewer resources than the well-off, they lack information and skills provided to the well-off, and lack access to such public goods as clean water and consumables subject to food and drugregulations.<br /><br />The poor are therefore extremely heterogeneous. Microfinance organizations like the Grameen Bank therefore provide a general path to affluences, simply because only a fraction of the population has the will and ability to be successful entrepreneurs. On the other hand, entrepreneurs often fail several times before finally becoming successful, so the authors advise an expanded microfinance industry that is more tolerant of the sorts of behaviors that may involve short-term losses, but lead to long-run successes. The authors conclude that we must consider microfinance policies as extremely successful and worthy of following, even though it is not panacea for the abolition of poverty.<br /><br />Because the poor lack access to social services freely available to the non-poor, the authors advocate such measures as providing clean water to poor villages and adding nutrients, such as iron, to staple foods. This, they argue, is not charity but simply the extension to poor of services already supplied to the rest of society.<br /><br />Concerning education, the authors believe that poor parents are usually very eager to have their children educated, although they may lack the means of enrolling their children in schools or providing for their transportation to and from school. However, too often the content of schooling is determined by what is good for the more affluent classes, so poor children are led voluntarily to quit school. The authors advise that the content of education take into account the preferences and culture of the target population.<br /><br />I cannot do justice to the beauty and intricacy of the argument developed in this book. The authors' main point is that we must look closely at the details of the lives of the poor in order to develop policies to help people to pull themselves out of poverty. This is neither demand or supply wallah-ism, and as they repeatedly stress, real progress can be made even in a society whose government provides a poor environment for economic development.regulations.<br /><br />The poor are therefore extremely heterogeneous.

B0050PLT8W|2.0|If you are a long time fan of TOAD, then you will find this album disappointing. This is their worst album yet. Each album has gotten progressively more mainstream and sounds more terrible each time. For pop lovers, commercial music lovers, and Nickelback lovers this album is probably great. For people who enjoyed Theory of a Deadman and Gasoline, you will be disappointed. Think what you will, but they keep recycling, \\"Love sucks\\" songs and are turning into commercial crud.

B00127RAJY|4.0|In the 30 Day Shred, Jillian Michaels presents a strenuous workout that promises big results.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with Jillian, she is a hardcore trainer with a mouth to match.  She yells things like \\"I want you to feel like you're going to die\\" and generally has no sympathy for you. She proclaims to be \\"the toughest trainer on Earth\\", and the 30 Day Shred definitely lives up to that statement.    The 30 Day Shred works on Jillian's \\"3-2-1 System\\", which is 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of ab work repeated in three rounds of varying exercises.  The workout includes a short warm-up and an even shorter cool down for a total of about 25 minutes of exercise.  It also offers three workouts that increase in intensity.  Jillian makes the sound recommendation that you start with Level 1 and work to the next levels as you become more fit.    The workouts are difficult and not exactly for beginners.  Some moves, especially in Levels 2 and 3, require jumping or plyometrics.  Aside from the usual \\"talk to your doctor before starting a fitness program\\", Jillian doesn't exactly warn you of this before you start the video.  However, she does offer some \\"modified\\" moves for those who can't do plyometrics.    Jillian is a tough trainer, but she doesn't exercise as much as she talks about exercise.  Her \\"girls\\", Natalie and Anita, are the epitome of athletic and perform the workouts with huge smiles.  Jillian usually stops mid-move to go over to one of them and explain what is going on.  Her explanations are helpful for the most part, but the camera just ends up following her around instead of focusing on the exercise itself. Thankfully, the moves are repetitive enough that you can learn them after just a few sessions. However, when you are hopping around your living room like a crazy person, the combination of Jillian's voice and the cheesy techno music can get pretty annoying.  Even still, for the motivated and dedicated exercisers who follow the 30 Day Shred, Jillian does exactly what she sets out to do: She gets results.    I lost almost 30 pounds using this workout and a healthy diet.  I had done little to no exercise before I picked up this video, and I started seeing results almost immediately.  After 30 days, I was able to run a 5k.  I don't consider myself \\"totally shredded\\", but I have muscles and am no longer winded when I work out.  Overall, it is a good workout system for those daring people committed to the challenge and willing to deal with quirks of Jillian Michaels.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|Ok, so everyone is like; WHERE'S THE HEAVY MUSIC? WHERE'S OLD INCUBUS? S.C.I.E.N.C.E and all that crap. Well, people, the band has changed, it has been changing since a long time. I can say, good bands have the ability to change, and not stick to the same sound just because it has succeeded once. This album is calm, easy music, but full of messages and amazing lyrics, it still shows the greatness of Incubus. If you don't like it, then go and replay S.C.I.E.N.C.E. over and over again.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Ok. At the end the most important things were wrapped up, but I'm neither in awe nor disappointed. With the last book of the series it's almost inevitable to give an opinion more about the overall series than the single book. I must admit that I struggled with it from the 25% to the 50% of it and there were moments it exhausted me - Mac exhausted me. She was so much into herself and instead I was waiting for things to happen and move on outside of her ***mild spoiler*** but maybe that was the point, since what's inside her is so important ***end spoiler***.     In the first couple of books I complained a lot about Mac, but I also enjoyed the setting, especially because everything seemed to take place in Dublin or specific places in Ireland and there was the Fae world interfering with it. I thought the Dark Zones were a touch of genius. In the last two books Mac travelled a lot between different realms, even if Dublin remained the center of the confrontation between good and evil, but I didn't like to lose the sense of place that was so present in the first books of the series. Even if the author built a very interesting world, it lost touch with reality. I repeat myself, but I think the strong point of the first books was Fae interfering with the real world, Unseelie castes in glamour feeding upon humans; human people with special talents guarding our world, etc. When everything began to escalate, I found myself struggling with the book. Instead of taking me away, it made me impatient, tired. It was probably Mac, her narration. It was never light, it was weighed down with whatever was happening and it was a bit boring.     Barrons. He is the very reason why I loved this series and what we learn about him in this book really broke my heart. I have nothing negative to say about his character, except that I don't really understand what he saw in Mac. Mac sees a lot of emotions playing in Barrons and I have no problems believing it. He is so powerful and even if he keeps himself in check, his personality can't help coming through, his generosity and loyalty. What's under the garage is his weakness and in retrospect he is even larger than what I made him to be, because he is a man who knows pity, who lives with a burden - I don't want to use this word for it, but I can't think of another more fitting word - but in the end he tries to play with the cards he's given. If compared to him, Mac, who is the narrator, who should share her emotions with the reader, seemed colder, more shallow, she's always overcompensating. I think that if the author had explored her feelings instead of her speculations the book would have been better.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I'm a snob when it comes to alternative fiction - such a snob that I avoid using the word fantasy.  I still hold Tolkien separately and above all.  But Rothfuss might just turn out to be the missing piece of a trinity with Guy Gavriel Kay and George R. R. Martin.   If you read Kay's all-too-brief books in one or two days, knowing that the pleasure of them will be followed by years of drought; if you disappear, guilt free, with each new book in Martin's Ice and Fire series and were willing to forgive him for the interminable wait for Dance with Dragons, then the very least that Rothfuss will give you is something extremely worthwhile to read while waiting for Kay and Martin.  And if those two authors aren't very very careful, Rothfuss is going to sneak up and steal their readers.  I won't bother you with all the things that a thousand other reviewers have said.  I'm just here as the messenger for fans of Kay and Martin. If anything less than their books isn't worth your time, then know that this book is worth your time.   And you'll be glad that when you finish it, the next book in the series has already been written.
159420229X|1.0|Harry Lorayne, Tony Buzan and Dominic O'Brien have all written well on this subject.  I'd recommend the latter's book \\"How to Develop a Perfect Memory\\" if you can get it, but sadly it's out of print and hard to find.<br />[[ASIN:1857931068 How to Develop a Perfect Memory]]<br /><br />After that I'd recommend Lorayne's book [[ASIN:0345410025 The Memory Book: The Classic Guide to Improving Your Memory at Work, at School, and at Play]] as a useful guide that even covers things like remembering where you put your keys.<br /><br />If you've read both of those, you aren't going to learn anything new in this book, except the personal experiences of one Joshua Foer (who admits that he still has trouble remembering where his keys are).  It might seem unkind to deny the literary value of a person's personal experiences but in this case I feel that there are many better ways one might spend their time.  Racing snails for instance.<br /><br />If you find yourself desperate for a book of personal experiences sprinkled with a few memory techniques (and don't we all feel the urge occasionally!) then my final suggestion would be to pick up Derren Brown's 'Tricks of the Mind' which covers the subject briefly but in an entertaining manner. [[ASIN:B0034FJGBM Tricks Of The Mind]]
B000X2H8G4|5.0|The Sonic Super Ear Personal Sound Amplifier is an excellent conversation aide for those experiencing extreme difficulty in hearing.  It does not filter out background noise, so you may not find it quite as useful for TV amplification, group (party) settings, or for instances where the person speaking is a significant distance from the microphone.  The best performance will be in quiet settings with either one-on-one conversation or a small group of people.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I imagine that almost every English speaking reader has seen one of the many, many versions of this classic put on film. It is one of my favorite stories and I have an old edition of it on my library shelf. But even with a copy in my collection, I was quite glad to add this one to my Kindle. The ability to rapidly look up some of the older Victorian English words and phrases with the built-in Kindle dictionary made reading it even more enjoyable. Plus, who can argue with the price (free)!
B0036EH3WU|2.0|I don't have a television and do not live in the United States, but someone gave me a set of disks, which I watched on my computer. Well, that's not true. I watched the first five episodes of the first season, then gave up on it. This was largely because (a) each character was a modern drama archetype, (b) no character behaved believably, (c) the story was needlessly strung out, strung out only for the sake of making the serial draw people to watch the next episode. Really not much interesting here, just typical American tv junk. Some of the scenery is pretty, though.
B000IOM1YQ|5.0|I only recently discovered this album. As a big fan of Alan Parsons Project I don't know how I missed this one but wish I hadn't. Another good collection of his work. The title song is incredible with many unusual supporting background sounds (but all working perfectly with the track). Great album, glad I found it!
1416575464|5.0|This magazine was the best ever for inspiration on bohemian, luxury, adventure living.  I lament monthly the non-existence of this magazine.  I now wish I had kept every copy I ever owned.  However, since I do not and will never again (old copies are going for $20 each on ebay), this is the second best thing to having the magazines in my library.  It is a condensed version of all the best wisdom from the magazine itself.  Particularly helpful are the resources in the back!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I have wanted to read this classic for many years. When offered as a free book on my Kindle I could not pass that up. Have enjoyed reading it immensely! One exceptionally great feature is that with Kindle's pre-loaded dictionary, it was very easy to check on the meaning of some of the older Victorian English terms that are not used much these days. Did not have to set my book down and pick up a my desk copy of Webster's. I only had to select the word and then select the dictionary. Immediately referenced the word and then I could go right back to where I was.
B003Y5H51K|3.0|The financier seemed too immature, but so did his girlfriend. The dad seemed like his temper was too hot for anyone who survives for a living. The death scenes were more grisly than I expected. Between the characters there was this bipolar action going on: \\"I can't do this!\\" ... \\"Yes, you can! I love you.\\" ... \\"OK, I can! Onward!\\"<br /><br />Really, it was weird.<br /><br />Weird I tell ya.
1451629184|5.0|if you watched the abc special but still have questions and/or want to know more get the book.like almost all the other reveiwers said, i couldnt put this book down and finished it in one day....its well written and really gives you the sense of what a day in the life was like for her.
B003YOXIVW|5.0|I discovered So many years after its time.  The music is dynamic & fun to listen to, perhaps more so because it's not more of the same ol' same ol'.  Peter Gabriel's lyrics are thought provoking and wise.  The recording is clear with no noticeable noise.  It's original, doesn't feel dated, and makes me want to check out more of his music. Recommended.

B002BNKQDK|4.0|This is a review of the Nite Owl version since people have talked about the blu-ray at length elsewhere.    The model is quite nicely done, with decent detail, airbrushed paint, lights & sound.  Collectors should be pleased.  The ship detaches from the base.  You activate the lights & sound via a \\"hidden\\" button on the top of the ship.  It has white lights on the front, lights on the bottom light up the base and rear blue lights for the engines.  The sound effects are thunder, crashing waves and the whine of the engines as the ship takes off.  The lights stay on until you press the button again.  It would be a shame to leave the ship boxed up.    I got this on sale and was quite pleased with it even though I'm not a huge fan of the movie.  Well, the blu-ray is nicely done too, and worth watching a few times.    I'd give it five stars if the movie was better and the regular price of this version wasn't so expensive.  Amazon deserves credit for offering such a nice collector's edition though.

Then scrambling for the last 100 pages to give us cliffhangers to make us want to buy the next book for another 100 pages of plot advancement. I have to hand it to him, his greed is beyond limits. He will continue to strike while the iron is hot and take on 200 projects at a time and swear up and down he is \\"busy working out the mereneese knot\\". Oh speaking of, what the hell happened to that knot? It sure didnt get worked out. Its a freaking mess there. Daenarys was terrible. She went from one of my favorite characters to oh crap not another Daenarys chapter. So yeah all in all we were ripped. He absolutely knows what he is doing. I love how he put off the release until the HBO show finished with a few weeks inbetween for people to read books 1-4 and be ready to buy book 5. If you think that was coincidental you are an idiot. No way it took him 6 years to write this book. No way it took him 3 years to \\"unravel the knot\\". Last book I buy written by GRRM. I will wait for the series to be completed and buy them from a used bookstore. I will not contribute another penny to GRRMs greed.

B004LWZW2E|5.0|As a huge horror fan I really wanted to see \\"Insidious\\" because like fans of this genre know it's rare to find a really well-put together horror. This is definitely one of the best in years. Ty Simpkins really stood out, not just because his character was the focal point of the movie but because he was so believable. The rest of the cast was amazing. Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne gave exceptional performances that ran the gamut of a multitude of emotions. The story was creative and new yet there was also a sense of familiarity. The overall movie mixed just the right amount of drama and fright. Congruent to movies in this category the music is essential and it just added to the element and provided a really great backdrop to an already terrifying in-your-face picture. If you're looking for a good scare and I mean a really good scare that's not at all over-the-top this movie is a must-see. Remember, don't repeat the surprise shock ending.

B004RUF9DC|3.0|This is a great classic but I was highly disappointed by the quality of the Blu-ray. I actually watched it side by side with its non-HD version and the latter was actually a better remastering.     I would not recommend it, except that it is a great classic epic.    LC
B0044XV3QY|5.0|As always I'm leaving a review of a specific version because of Amazon's odd policy of lumping them all together.    I am delighted with this version. The 'extended' version was great; just enough additional material to improve it, not so much to overload you. And on the extra features discs there is more material than you could shake a remote control at. Actually if it had been me I would have put some of the deleted scenes in the movie, but that's just opinion.    I'm not sure a lot of people appreciate how influential this movie will be in the future of movie making. The technological advances here are really monumental. Even given that Cameron did not take his eyes off the story which works very well.    I did read a bad review that said that; 1. The movie was leftist propaganda and, 2. it was a remake of [[ASIN:B004AOECTC Dances with Wolves (20th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]]]. The first is correct as it is well recorded history that Thomas Jefferson often had his slaves strip mining his land at Monticello and John Adams advocated the eradication of indigenous peoples (btw, for those of you who are too literal, I'm being very broadly sarcastic here). As to the second I'm pretty sure they jumping off the cliff scene came from [[ASIN:B0012GVKW8 Predator [Blu-ray]]], or wait, wasn't it in [[ASIN:B000EXDS5M Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] first? NO WAIT, it first was in [[ASIN:B002FOFXNS Tarzan of the Apes]] with Elmo Lincoln in 1918; That's it! It's a frame for frame remake of the 1918 film! (again, broad sarcasm here; I have to say that because people who make claims like the above have very low levels of humor detection).    I really recommend this edition. I have not even had the time to go through all the extra features.
0375831002|5.0|To preface, I have always been drawn to stories of the Holocaust ever since my first read of \\"Number the Stars\\" in elementary school.  In middle school and high school I read every fiction and non-fiction book regarding WWII that the school libraries had.  Over the years my taste in genres have broadened- but last week I decided to dip into my old past-time and simply searched online \\"great stories/books of the Holocaust\\"- and \\"The book thief\\" came up- I had never heard of it before.  I bought it on my kindle and in the first few pages, I quickly realized that this was not my taste in writing at all.  It was overly creative and the story line felt so ungrounded.  I immediately wished I had ordered the free sample version.  But, not one to abandon an unfinished book, I kept going.  I never ever expected to have been so moved by this unfolding story.  Never before have I encountered writing where I could literally feel the words on my skin.  I am usually a fast reader but it took me more than a week to get through this book simply because there were times where I read a sentence and then needed to go back just to savor its quality.  I know it is listed as young adult, and I am not sure if the rest of Zusak's books actually qualify under that category, but I assure you that no 13 year old could appreciate the quality of writing that you will find in some sections of this novel.  By the end of the book I longed to hold each character in my arms, I was that attached.  If you love to read, hate book \\"fluff,\\" and admire eloquent writing, then this is a book you owe yourself to read. In a way, the creative quality of \\"The Book Thief\\" and the absolute power of the story reminds me of \\"The Life of Pi\\" but with just a bit more soul.
B003UESJEM|4.0|While the media pumps out apocalyptic science-fiction fantasies centering around the world ending in 2012, the story we don't hear about centers on the slow, continuous destruction of people and families in America other than irrelevant en masse news briefs on the state of the global hivemind.  While the movie spends a lot of time with Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) and how his sudden loss of income affects him and his family, director John Wells made sure he didn't let the talents of the rest of the star-studded cast go to waste.  Most notable is Tommy Lee Jones who is brilliant as a top-level executive struggling against the \\"business-friendly\\" policies of his company and what they do to the lives of those around him.  It ends the way I expected, unfortunately.
1451629184|5.0|I got this on my kindle and started reading it the next day.  Little did I know I would not stop until it was done.  Very rarely have a read a book cover to cover in one sitting.

Jaycee thank you for making your story public in a very dignified manor.  Shame on you law enforcement and specifically parole officers for not doing your job.      Did anyone one else notice that Jaycee stated that in her book she actually TALKED to some of the parole officers??  Did anyone else catch that?

0307946711|3.0|If you haven't read the book, get out! There is nothing for you here. Just don't read any of these reviews. It is hard to imagine that an Amazon review won't have any kind of spoiler that will influence your reading. Just get out of here. If you want to read this book, just read it. The only thing that I should tell you is to enjoy the ride.    My wife read it and thought that I would enjoy it. I started reading without knowing anything about the book. That's maybe how every book should be read, every movie should be seen and every song must be heard.    Now... For those that read it, I need to say a few things. I couldn't believe what happened. I just couldn't. I was at my commute back home, one of the few moments of my day that I have the time to myself, and I just melted. Life didn't make more sense anymore. I felt apart. I read it and read it again and again just to make sure. Then I cheated. I browsed the last chapters. Apparently, that was it. All of this happened this evening. And I am still deeply moved.    The writing was so good! I could understand the reference to the 80s, to Paris and London. I felt so smart reading this book. I was wondering if anyone else was getting as I was. That's a book that was written specially for me, I thought. And then I found out that it was a trap. Manipulated was a word used by another reviewer here. Manipulated. Right on. I felt like used. Manipulated. Disgusted. Screw you, Mr. Writer. What the hell. After all this time, giving the best time of my the day to you, you leave me with that. There wasn't a moment of my day that I wouldn't picture those two happy together. They were so beautiful, with so much hope.... I disagree with those that said that Emma was not for Dex. They were the same. The same sense of humor. The same everything. It made me wonder if it is the ideal love. The love that we all aim. I loved them both.    Emma was not a wus. She had patience. She loved Dex so much that even when she could have him (the trip to Greece, the dinner at the Soho restaurant), she didn't want him. She didn't want him like that. She wanted him just for her. She waited for her moment. She gave up a few times, but she always had hope. That scene in the maze was a good setup. It was almost like an orgasm, which should have happened in Paris. And that is what I am not sure if it was intentional or not. The orgasm didn't happen. We didn't have that D minor with Emma exclaiming from the bottom of her hearth \\"I always loved you so much, Dex\\", as the happiest woman in the world. It was not like that. They both said \\"I love you\\" to each other on irrelevant moments (letters, voice mails and so on). But at that moment, in Paris, there was not the cosmical and epic \\"I love you\\".    Should I recommend this book? How many stars does it deserve? A book that felt me miserable but taught me a great lesson about life is a good or bad book? That's how life is. We learn more on our saddest moments.  Let's see how I fell tomorrow. For now, I will give it three stars. Maybe some days in my life, this book will be 10 stars and some other days it will be zero stars. This thing of stars for this book is totally inappropriate... I just need to get over it and get some fresh air...    My wife was surprised by my reaction. After all, I like opera and depressing European movies. I confess that I was surprised too.
B00008QSA5|4.0|I will diverge from popular opinion and state that this is not the Rock Summit/jam session that it was marketed as (especially in the liner notes, which start: \\"Always, the best things happen after hours, when the cat's away...\\"). What it really is, is an Al Kooper album - his choices define it - and if seen in that light, it's a very good one indeed, unless you don't like Al and his rheumy singing. I happen to like Al a lot, and appreciate him now more than I did back when this came out.     Oh, there are the loose blues numbers like \\"Albert's Shuffle\\", in which Mike Bloomfield participates, but I prefer the tightly arranged tracks like \\"It Takes a Lot To Laugh\\", whose hard-rock transformation sounds nothing like Dylan's original - Al might as well have called it something else and kept the royalties. Maybe it was recorded in a hurry, but it's clear Kooper had it well planned out, and just told Steve Stills \\"do a lick here\\". With Al's double-tracked harmony vocals, it could be a Byrds 45.    My point is, if you don't like the druggy phasing on \\"You Don't Love Me\\" or the horns on \\"Season of the Witch\\", or the ondoline (aka Kooperphone) on \\"Holy Modal Majesty\\", it's because you were expecting a different album, and given the title of this package, who can blame you? Super Session my ass! A crackerjack arrangement like that heard on \\"Man's Temptation\\" could have come right off \\"Child Is Father to the Man\\". The heck with \\"always, the best things happen after hours\\". In this case, the best things happen on studio time, with a producer who has a strong vision.    I deduct one star from the rating for including the horn-less reiterations of \\"Albert\\" and \\"Season\\". Al wanted the horns.
B00005RHGL|4.0|Opening on Christmas Day in 1993, Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer's \\"Tombstone\\" film enjoyed more than a half-year's head start on rival Kevin Costner's similar (and far more expensive) pet project, \\"Wyatt Earp.\\"  Largely through word of mouth, they easily won the battle of the box office.  In terms of pure entertainment, the romanticized \\"Tombstone\\" deserved to win, at least at that time because it carefully treaded the line between an adult Western melodrama (hence, the R rating) and often cartoony but vintage Hollywood clich&eacute;s, making it appealing to a very wide range of audiences.  Its ominous poster tagline, \\"Justice is Coming,\\" spells out perfectly the old-school Western that the movie is.<br /><br />In recent years, star Russell has purportedly admitted to secretly directing \\"Tombstone\\" using credited director George Cosmatos as an artistic front after original writer-director Kevin Jarre was dismissed.  Assuming that is a fact, it makes sense why \\"Tombstone\\" so often resembles a classic Western, since Russell is such an old pro dating back to his childhood working in this genre.  Using his expertise, there are several thematic choices that are simplistically brilliant here.  The four that most come to mind are: 1. asserting Wyatt Earp as a biblical-like Pale Horseman in which death, hell, and justice will follow in his wake; and 2. assigning trademark red sashes to the villainous Clanton-Curly Bill gang, so viewers can easily distinguish the good guys from the bad.  Obviously, no real Old West desperado would have sought that kind of unwanted legal attention, but it works really well for Hollywood's frontier mobsters in this movie who just don't care about anonymity.<br /><br />The third important choice is focusing the film equally on Wyatt and \\"Doc\\" Holliday.  Although Russell coolly has more screen time, Kilmer's flamboyant, rakish take on the tubercular Holliday steals the show.  Yet, by working together, the two actors effectively balance out each other's performances.  The relatively solid all-star ensemble cast, including old hand Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Stephen Lang (a dead-on Ike Clanton),  and even a cameo from Charlton Heston conveys the ambiance of an old-school Western complete with mustache-twirling villains and reluctant ex-lawmen putting the silver badge on again.  The major casting problem lies with Morgan and Virgil's indistinctive blonde wives (who don't have any presence or dialogue) and more so with romantic co-lead Dana Delany.  While Delany enjoys some solid chemistry with Russell, she is miscast as a frisky, young Josephine Marcus, since the real Josie Marcus evidently wasn't anything like her.<br /><br />Lastly, the fourth factor is correctly presenting names and accepted historical events in the right order while heavily embellishing other \\"facts\\" about the great Earp & Holliday-Clanton feud that ignited the legendary Gunfight at the OK Corral and its bloody aftermath.  \\"Tombstone\\" also benefits from a majestic, well-balanced musical score from Bruce Broughton, and the fact that the filmmakers strove to make their Arizona location shooting (in Tucson) as colorful as possible, even with a close recreation of Tombstone itself.<br /><br />The film clearly stumbles when the various cliches (too many to mention) start piling up so close together that you don't need to know the historical back story to sense what is coming next.  Also, because of the huge ensemble cast, many characters (i.e. Jason Priestley's Deputy Sheriff Billy Breckenridge) are under-developed or so one-dimensional that the script treats them like mere after-thoughts.  You may also notice some occasional spots where the actors (including Billy Zane's efforts and Russell's wooden last line to Kilmer) sink into stilted melodrama, which erodes their overall performances.  As I stated in my review of \\"Wyatt Earp,\\" I honestly believe that, had these rival productions actuallyworked together by pooling all their mighty resources, a better and more profitable film would have resulted.<br /><br />Rating: 7.5/10 (In terms of sheer entertainment value, \\"Tombstone\\" trumps the plodding \\"Wyatt Earp,\\" despite its heavy reliance on traditional Western clich&eacute;s and some weak performances.  If they are compared side by side, I would consider the two films as roughly even with an edge to Costner's film for technical merits).<br /><br />P.S.  The impressive DVD special features are pretty solid entertainment and quite fun to watch.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee tells her story, her horrible nightmare, with such honesty and strength. Some of the details she shares are hard to read- but not reading them doesn't erase that it happened.  Although a terrifying experience, she never lost hope and reflects quite articulately, what she did to make it through each day, week, month, and for several years.  She describes a very lonely life with such simple and heartfelt dreams. She has hope, but you can't imagine how. And when she speaks of the many times of having a dog, bird, cat, or even a spider, around her to care for, she is lifted and feels a purpose, only to have those things eventually gone too.  She re-invents the term survivor. Just a little girl who wants her mom and to wake up from this horrible dream.
B0001US8EO|4.0|In the summer of 1994, actor Kevin Costner's Western mega-epic \\"Wyatt Earp\\" crashed and burned at the cinema effectively halting his lengthy streak of critically-acclaimed hits dating back to \\"The Untouchables\\" in 1987.  At the time, the modestly-profitable rival \\"Tombstone\\" had effectively stolen Costner's thunder by beating him to the box office punch six months earlier and leaving his far more expensive saga as a tired retread.  Still, in its expanded version, \\"Wyatt Earp\\" deserves re-discovery for factors extending beyond Costner's presence alone.<br /><br />I will first address director Lawrence Kasdan and producer Costner's intentions since Costner basically is the movie.  This duo evidently wanted to capture a somber Louis L'Amour-esque look on-screen (the costuming is a dead giveaway), as their tragic interpretation of Earp's life story often resembles an Old West version of \\"The Godfather,\\" replacing mobsters with frontier cops.  Unfortunately, with so many individuals introduced or merely name-dropped in the span of three hours, similar characters (especially rustler Curly Bill and friends) blend together far too easily making it hard to tell them apart.  If you are not already familiar with whom all these historical figures are, then good luck to those who can't recognize who's who.  The same problem extends to the desert backdrop.  As the movie was filmed on location in New Mexico, this would explain why Wichita, Dodge City, and Tombstone largely all look like the same locale.  \\"Tombstone,\\" on the other hand, had the advantage of one primary location, which certainly simplifies the necessary story-telling.<br /><br />With a timeline spanning nearly forty years, \\"Wyatt Earp\\" should be commended for ambitiously giving viewers as much story as possible, but this inevitably causes obvious pacing issues.  Costner may have assumed that lightning would strike twice following the majestic 1990 \\"Dances With Wolves,\\" but this plodding film's ambiance (including James Newton Howard's melancholic score) is unable to successfully carry 180+ minutes without any comic relief or an exhilarating romance (although Costner and co-star Joanna Going are believable as Wyatt and the third Mrs. Earp).  The script's sometimes clunky dialogue also disguises speeches (i.e. Gene Hackman as Earp's father repeatedly spellling out the Earp family credo) and explanations of off-screen incidents as everyday dialogue, which only further muddles the slow narrative.<br /><br />The film's all-star ensemble (also including Dennis Quaid, Mark Harmon, Annabeth Gish, Michael Madsen, JoBeth Williams, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, among many others) is top-notch, as it should be considering the production's estimated $75 million price tag.  Specifically, I give kudos to Dennis Quaid as the film's acting MVP.  Rather than copying Val Kilmer's high-profile, flamboyantly roguish take on John \\"Doc\\" Holliday, Quaid's coarsely authentic approach was certainly overlooked for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nod (if not the trophy itself).  To Quaid's credit, he  not only looked the part, but he made the tubercular, decaying Holliday as unlikeable as most of his contemporaries thought he was.  Mare Winningham as Wyatt's second wife, Mattie, also merits acclaim.  Others, such as Hackman, Gish, James Gammon, and Joanna Going, in supporting roles, deserve some honorable mention as well.<br /><br />As for Costner's performance, with some reservations, it is generally a positive.  Based upon the various accounts of Wyatt Earp's life that I have read, his stone-faced portrayal of Earp is virtually dead-on.  Further, I would conclude that, although Kurt Russell physically resembled the real Wyatt Earp (and, yes, was more entertaining), Costner's depth drew closer to Wyatt's cold fish personality.  Make no mistake, though: Costner's ego tends to overplay his hand, including twice where he makes short announcements to the stunned saloon crowd upon prevailing in battle.  Somehow,I don't imagine that rowdy drunkards would have been awed into silent fear by Earp's mere presence.  Also, by having other characters tell Wyatt how much better a stage driver, buffalo hunter, shooter, etc. he is than they are, it doesn't really help build a myth; rather, it becomes a bore.<br /><br />The bleak, gritty realism of \\"Wyatt Earp\\" will appeal far more to movie-goers who enjoy historical documentaries as entertainment vs. those who prefer straight-up Hollywood historical fantasy (and, yes, \\"Tombstone\\" is largely a Western fantasy).  Speaking of which, it is known that Costner was originally linked to \\"Tombstone,\\" until he had a falling out with late writer-director Kevin Jarre over the proposed film's scope.  It helps explain the supposed bad blood between the rival productions, as Costner's ego dictated that he must pursue his own epic vision of Earp's life.  He was definitely right in providing the characters far more depth and creating a realistically somber balance.  Case in point: Costner and Kasdan accurately depict an aloof Wyatt as being despised by his sister-in-laws, as his brothers too often deferred to Wyatt's needs over their own wives.  Further, Mare Winningham's performance as Wyatt's neglected second wife, Mattie, is heartbreaking to watch as it removes even more luster from Earp's status as an Old West icon.  Except for conveniently ignoring the real Wyatt's alleged antics as a card shark and opportunistic con artist, Costner's film is and will likely remain the closest Hollywood will come to exploring Earp's legendary life story.  To its credit, the film's classy finale acknowledges that separating fact from fiction is often next to impossible, so Earp's life will always (to some degree) remain a mystery.  Still, real history alone doesn't sell movie tickets.  Despite offering a mostly outstanding Western epic for adult viewers, Costner and Kasdan underestimated the necessity of popcorn entertainment that \\"Tombstone\\" captured so well with mainstream audiences.<br /><br />As a random thought, this epic movie still has extraordinary potential if it were cleverly re-edited, i.e. trimming much of its first third into quick-snippet flashbacks, such as Urilla's (or Irilla's) death, for a more haunting effect on Wyatt's psyche during the Tombstone years.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10 (In most categories, it's a historically superior and better-acted film that ages better than \\"Tombstone,\\" but it sorely lacks the other film's charismatic flavor.  It really depends upon what you are looking for in a big-screen Western: gritty realism or Hollywood fantasy).<br /><br />P.S.  The DVD special features are not necessarily spectacular, but they are certainly some nice, well-produced additions to check out when you have the time.  Included in the special edition are some additional scenes that pad the film's running time past 190 minutes.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|I've found that this type of humor is not what most Americans find entertaining.  It's too slow and subtle which I think is the beauty of it.  French comedies are a genre of its own and this film is a perfect example of it.<br /><br />I grew up in Ukraine where French comedies were extremely popular instead of the usual American pie-in-the face, fart, toilet humor jokes so perhaps I have a different take on this.  This film is brilliant in the most typical French comedy way.  It's subtle and funny and quirky but at the end of the film I feel like all is right since these French comedies usually come full circle.  The Dinner Game is a personal favorite of mine because of all the twists and turns in it and the lessons to be taken from this script.  It's witty and quirky and everything that a French comedy should be.  5 stars all the way and I wish more Americans would appreciate this particular genre.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|One of the few bands out there that are actually BETTER live than on CD.  How refreshing!!!    Although I can definitely tell the influences of Queen and Depeche Mode and U2 in Muse's music, I can appreciate it because those are some of my favorite bands and they are not just reusing their music, they are putting a new spin on it and making it their own.  I love the passion that comes out of every song and every chord.  It's powerful and thoughtful and meaningful.  It's so refreshing to hear this in a world of Katy Perrys and Black Eyed Peas who offer nothing other than generic beats, horrible lyrics, and tone deaf vocals.    I saw Muse live last year and they were AWESOME.  They opened for U2 which was a perfect fit.  The crowd went crazy and they really did sound better live than on CD.  Love the passion and the intelligence behind the music.  It's rare these days!!!!
B0045HCJFS|1.0|Not widescreen!!!  The back of the DVD states: \\"Widescreen version presented in a \\"matted\\" widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition enhanced for widescreen TVs.\\"  What does that mean?  It's a load of double-speak.  The DVD is NOT widescreen.  It's 100% full screen.  If you're looking for widescreen, as I am, you might consider those double features (two DVDs for the price of one) that were released in the last 3-5 years.  I believe those are widescreen-- but I'll find out soon enough!    NOT WIDESCREEN

B004WKOCP8|5.0|I don't normally write reviews but I had to get on here if for nothing else then to raise this album's average from a measly 3 stars. Now Incubus is my favorite band, always has been and always will be. I even have a Chuck tattoo. So with that said you might take this review as biased but I will try my hardest to stay objective. Now usually when I first listen to a new Incubus album, the first time it grabs me in some way. My first listen through this album a couple of months ago I was scared. Nothing seemed to grab me or stand out. Everything blended together. I thought for the first time Incubus had disappointed me. So now I see all these negative reviews and can only hope that people stay with the album so it can become what it has to me. I now realize that this album was totally intentional. This is where they were going to end up if you think about it. Songs like \\"oil and water\\", \\"diamonds and coal\\" and even \\"here in my room\\" are proof of it. No two Incubus albums sound the same. The fact that all these people expect another S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or Make Yourself just shows how much they know about the band. Those albums are over a decade old and even those two records sound nothing alike. With Morning View started the alt-rock influence. The last two albums, CLOTM and Light Grenades sound the most alike, and I attribute that to Ben's funk/soul influence on the band. And now we have If Not Now, When? Just like always the band tweaked their sound for a new record, more drastically then ever before. This album is a slow burn. Keep listening to it and eventually you will just \\"get it.\\" It is very minimalistic and open spaced.  Mike isn't just a guitar player, he plays piano and composes every single song himself. Kilmore doesn't just scratch records, he provides sonic landscapes to add to the feel of the track. Jose's drumming is very calculated and quite often provides the backbone of the best songs. Even Brandon's lyrics which are a lot of the time meant to be indecipherable are much more straight forward and in tune with the album. It is a self-contained masterpiece. If you want a band to stay the same and true to a sound there are plenty of them out there but this band will never be one of them. Don't expect something that is never going to happen. In another 5 years we'll probably hear a new Incubus album that sounds nothing like this.

B004Y1USJE|3.0|'fly from here' is an album where if you singled out any particular song, you could argue it stands on its own merit. that said, together as a whole, it often moves at a lethargic pace. with the possible exception of the closing track (the terrific \\"into the storm\\"), yes rarely stomps on the gas pedal. the end result is reminiscent of the 'drama' album, however a much kinder, gentler version. what tips the scales into the \\"worth owning\\" category is guitarist steve howe's performance, delivering many tasty & memorable licks throughout. i do prefer 'fly from here' over the band's last few studio efforts, but admittedly the material lacks the attitude & ferocity of your typical yes album, lineups notwithstanding. if you're a diehard & have extra money to blow, you should probably get the japanese edition, since the track \\"hour of need\\" has an intro & outro tacked on (totaling an extra 3+ minutes) which is unavailable on other versions....

When Sam and Cole get word of the hunt that Culpeper has orchestrated to finally kill the wolves, they know there's no way to stop him. And so they're forced, with Isabel's somewhat reluctant help, to somehow find a way to not only understand the virus that makes them turn into wolves, but save the entire pack.     Maggie Stiefvater is at her very best here. With equal parts action, romance, and moral contemplation, Forever is a lyrical and breathtaking conclusion. The excellent character development in Linger continues into this finale: Sam is forced to face the looming unknown of the future much quicker than he'd like, and become a leader, sometimes without the support of Grace. Grace has Sam, and has finally grasped onto the independence she's been fighting for--but at a large cost. Isabel, despite desperately not wanting to care about the wolves, and sometimes even her new friends, finds herself helping them in ways that could drive a wedge even further between her and her family. And Cole is forced to accept who he has become, for all his failures and successes, and work incredibly hard to create and preserve a new life for himself.     Along the way, both Cole and Sam are at odds with each other and how they view Beck and his actions, both good and bad, and are forced to live and work together to find a way to save the pack. Some unexpected characters step in, and other unseen forces work against the characters, culminating in an ending that is a suspenseful race against time, with some less than perfect consequences. Forever finishes out perfectly, with a note of finality but an open future for the characters of this intensely beautiful trilogy.
B004Y1USRG|4.0|I have been a Yes fan since I got my first copy of \\"Fragile\\".  Every Yes album seems to bring it's own feel. In my opinion, \\"Fly From Here\\" is not their best album of all time (Drama, Talk, Going For The One), but it delivers a very nice Yes experience. Benoit David sounds so much like Trevor Horn.  It lacks the muscle that \\"Drama\\" had, but the production is pristine, and the playing is top notch.  Also, the album packaging is incredible.  I bought it on vinyl (the only way to get a Yes album, in my opinion) and it sounds incredible.      I am on my second listen, and it is getting better the more I listen to it.  Yes not only deserves to be in the rock and roll hall of fame, but they sound great in 2011!
B000W25JUW|5.0|Look, being old enough to have had this Album on vinyl and '8 track' THIS was the version we all knew. The extended release is fantastic, but this was always the 'Allman Brothers Band at the Fillmore East' that we grew up with. And quite simply for me, my desert island disc. And has been that to me since I was15,(a long time ago). For my ears, no group of musicians EVER sounded this good Together in my particular lifetime. Simply magic. And they are what you would call, musician's musicians. Just buy it and enjoy. Used to be 4 sides of pure magic, now you don't even have to get up to flip sides or changes the record!
B004UHF51S|5.0|I've been listening to Michael Franks since 1976 when he came out with his first album.  I have always enjoyed his approach to the music.  He uses the best studio musicians, top soloists, a lot of Bossa Nova/Samba and much humor and romance in his lyrics.  This CD is a continuation of his signature to music.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it; of course, I thoroughly enjoy Michael Franks.
1452101248|5.0|This is more of the vegetarian recipes featured in the author's previous book. The style is kind of Middle Eastern with some world influence.  The recipes are quite ingredient rich; at the minimum ten ingredients in most of them. You should also be aware that you will have to go scouting for some ingredients. Thus this book is aimed squarely at foodies. However, you will be rewarded by excellent quality tasty food. If you are familiar with the author's [[ASIN:0091922348 Ottolenghi: The Cookbook]], it is more of the same but without the meat. If you only want to buy one book from the author I would recommend that you buy his first book. More work has gone into it than this second book.<br /><br />The book is inexplicably designed with a padded cover. As if the book doesn't belong in the kitchen. This is one of the most stupid book design ideas I have seen. The covers of my copy already have two dents, one caused by amazon's poor packaging. If the book stays in the kitchen, a knife can easily pierce the cover. The padded covers also mean that the book takes up slightly more bookshelf space. Whoever took this extremely stupid decision should stand up and explain himself.<br /><br />UPDATE 2015. I have cooked so much from this book so I am increasing the stars to five.
B000UJ48O0|4.0|The OC is a fun series to watch. It is so typical of California of the late 90's and into the 21st Century. The actors did very well and since I was working when the show originally came out I was glad to get it in DVD form.
0451169514|2.0|I'm sure to never hear the end of this, but this just wasn't my cup of tea. Don't get me wrong, the story was good, but too long for me. For people who love all the tiny details, this book is for you. My own personal tastes are action packed, and we really didn't get to that until the last 100 pages.<br /><br />I couldn't personalize with the characters, and the back story was too much. I found that about 60% of the back story could have been eliminated, and the end result would have been the same. One of my personal beliefs is to always give the author a chance to redeem themselves, so I never quit a book. On this particular book I found that challenging. I don't know how many times I found myself arguing to finish it, I even fell asleep reading, and I NEVER do that.<br /><br />This is the third King book that I have read, sorry Mr. King, you write good books, but they are just not my type. I think you do a wonderful job with the majority, but I'm just looking for something different. I think I'm going to have to break off this relationship.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|I liked the film.    But I wonder if the reason that the Mayan Calender ends on December 21, 2012, was that the \\"Mayan Calender Makers\\" lost their funding due to budget cuts?    $0.02
B004Y1USV2|5.0|I really love this new album, especially the title track. The more I listen to it, the more I love it. It's been a while since the band created an epic piece and it was really nice of them to revisit and update and expand upon this little nugget from 31 years ago. I love the whole of the piece, not just one particular part of it.<br /><br />Great playing by all and great vocals by Benoit David. He seems to sound like a hybird of both Jon Anderson and Trevor Horn on this album, but it's not a bad thing.<br /><br />\\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be,\\" although it's a long title, is a beautiful song wonderfully sung by Chris Squire and has a little nod to \\"Don't Go\\" from Magnification just before the chorus begins. This seems like a track that could've been on Fish Out Of Water or either COnspiracy album. Great song.<br /><br />\\"Life On A Film Set\\" is my favorite song on the album aside from the title track and it seems to be in two parts: the first part having something of a cold, dark feel with somber acoustic guitar and melancholy vocals and then turning into a bright, sunny, Yessy feel in the middle of it and then just stomping at the end. Did I hear some sort of a horn (no, not Trevor) near the end of the track? Hmm. It's still a great song.<br /><br />\\"Hour Of Need\\" is a folky is another great song that should also be released as a single, if such would be possible. Steve and Benoit's voices blend together in a magnificent way and the song is beautiful and melodic. I prefer the regular version over the Japanese-only bonus track version of the song.<br /><br />There's quite a bit of acoustic guitar work from Steve on this release and \\"Solitaire\\" is a brilliant little acoustic ditty as good as \\"Mood For A Day\\" or even \\"Masquerade.\\"<br /><br />\\"Into the Storm\\" is a great, dynamic song highly reminiscent of \\"On The Silent Wings Of Freedom\\" from Tormato and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" from Drama with a cool 7/4 middle section in it and excellent vocal harmonies from the band. It's a great finale<br /><br />This isn't an album that's very heavy on bass or keyboard solos, and Steve doesn't solo as much as he's done in the past, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. This album is representative as the band playing as a band, for the most part. It's something fresh from this new Yes. I really enjoy this new album and I hope the next one is not too far around the corner. Please work with Trevor again on the next one, guys!<br /><br />Yes is a band. It's not about one particular member, although all of them in one way or another contributed greatly to the history of one of the world's greatest and most dysfunctional rock bands. Yes, it's sad that Jon isn't in the band anymore, but even if he were back in the band, would we have a new album? I highly doubt that. I mean no disrespect to Jon by that comment.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|Really an intriguing movie, a little hard to follow but none the less, very romantic and different. Love the actors. THANKS AMAZON.COM
B004WKOCP8|1.0|Was looking for a good hard hitting sound. No distortion pedals nothing no real bass or even dj in the background. I think this band is starting to look like Train or a water down Coldplay. I mean it's more like it's his voice and it gets annoying quick. I also only found track number 10 as a good jam but thats all it.
B003PZEF0S|5.0|Amy and Rory are back on Earth. Years have past and Amy finally decides to settle down, marry Rory, and have a baby. She decides to live the rest of her life in her beautiful hometown out in the countryside; she's pregnant; and Rory is gainfully employed as a medical doctor. The Doctor decides to pay them a visit just to say hello and give good wishes. To Amy, everything is a fairytale story that ends with her happily ever after. Or is this just a dream?    Out of nowhere, Amy, Rory, and the Doctor are back in the Tardis and they can't tell what is real or what is fake. A mysterious man appears out of nowhere. He calls himself the Dreamlord. The Dreamlord threatens to kill them by making it a game. He makes the Tardis crash into a sun in one dream and aliens are about to kill them in the countryside in the other dream. Only one threat is real and the other is a fake. If they choose the real danger they will live. But if they choose the fake, then they will die. Ultimatley, Amy will have to make a decision because the Dreamlord took these threats from Amy's dreams.    This is a very cool episode. I like how the director uses singing birds to make a transition between the two dreams. Karen Gillan's acting abilities really shine in this episode. She's allowed to do more acting so I really get to see how talented she really is. There are some touching moments where Gillan says how much her character, Amy loves Rory. I also love the dialog between her and the Dreamlord played by Toby Jones. Amy is very scared of the Dreamlord but she lashes out at him in anger demanding him to tell her what she wants to know.
B004XIQIPQ|4.0|A very good rock album. If you've listened to their other three albums, I would say this doesn't sound much like them. The album has 12 songs of which about 8 are good to very good. So, before you buy this, sample the following: Brick by Brick, The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala, Love is a Laserquest and Suck it and See. These are 4 of the 8 good songs on this album. If you like these, buy the album. If not, you'd be better off downloading individual songs on iTunes or Amazon.com.    Download: Brick by Brick, The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala
B003RMUWEW|4.0|The Doctor takes Amy and Rory to England in 2015. They land in a small mining village where a large drill is setting a record. It drills deep into the earth and it caused an unusual event. The ground fights back. It shallows a man along with Amy. Rory and the Doctor try to find them and they discover that beneath the earth is a race of lizard people. The lizard people took the drilling as a threat so they attack the Doctor and his gang. The Doctor thought they were aliens but he soon finds out they they are not aliens but from Earth.    This is an OK episode. I was under suspense and a little scared when I didn't know what these lizard people were but once I understood that they're from Earth, I was disapointed. I expected the plot of the story a little more suspenseful. This is part one of a two part episode.
087033039X|5.0|bought this for my grandson for the upcoming christmas....if he doesn't want it, i'll keep it. directions are detailed and explicit and there are many illustrations that are easy to follow.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Like many other readers who have posted here, I read this book cover to cover without putting it down. I admire Jaycee Dugard's courage and incredible spirit. Her story is heart wrenching. Her journals written during captivity were the most compelling portion of the book for me. She presents the classic Stockholm Syndrome manipulated by her rapist/kidnapper. He deprives her of food & water breaking her down systematically over time. Intermittently he treats her with kindness and offers companionship. Eventually she begins to identify with the monster & his wife that snatched her off the street. Jaycee pines for love and acceptance. This story is both riveting and revealing. It evokes images of other kidnap victims like Patricia Hearst. Jaycee not only survives 18 years of abuse and privation, she triumphs over it. Jaycee emerges as heroic in her continuing ability to love and face life with joy. This is a remarkable book written by a remarkable young woman.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|The \\"Final Destination\\" franchise began going downhill rapidly after the second movie. But, will the fifth movie help the franchise go back up or will it continue going downhill fast?  I saw this movie about a month ago at the test screening, and I must say that, in my opinion, this is the most brutal, the most gruesome, and the most clever movie of the entire franchise. It has many well-thought out death scenes, and one death scene in the movie made me cringe and look away, and trust me, I watched A LOT of slasher/gornography films. One of the most famous scene is the lasik surgery which I thought was pretty good. I'm not going to spoil it for you.  First off, this movie has a very interesting plotline. As you heard from the trailer, you know the new death rule, and I think it is pretty clever. But, why didn't Bludworth tell it to the others? Hmmm...?  Second of all, the characters are very very relatable. You can actually tell if one hates the other, and one is friends with the other for a long time. Also, you can actually feel bad for a character when he/she gets hurt or dies. The acting is very impressive, hence the proffesional and experienced actors. I think this is one of the reasons why this movie made it to my highest rank of the \\"Final Destination\\" franchise.  Third, what is this franchise famous of? Exactly, the unique death scenes that happens from the materials/places we see/go to everyday. There are some death scenes here that are very gruesome that if I picture it, I either cringe or smile on how good the death scenes are. One death scene made it to my top 15 most brutal death scenes I have ever seen. Some of you might know it, some of you might not. One thing for sure is, you will know it when you see the movie in August.  Lastly, the ending of the whole movie. The ending that made me gasp and left my jaw dropped open for the rest of the movie. It is a pity that many people know it already and spoiled it for everyone, because thy will not be as surprised as everybody on the screening when we reached the ending of the movie. All I gotta tell you is rewatch the whole franchise and soak in every scene you see.. :)  So, this review might not be as long as you want it, and as detailed as you hoped for. But, all I have to say is watch the movie. It is way worth your money and your time. This will be a box-office hit. So, \\"Final Destination 6 and 7\\", here we come!
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I have been listening to this new release from The Decemberists since I purchased it several months ago. Love it, love it, love it!
0553801473|5.0|The beginning of this 5th book is much like A Feast for Crows. It's a good transition from the melancholy feeling of that book and this one starts out in a similar tone. I'm hoping it bring in a bit of A Storm of Swords as it progresses. I would like to see more big action. So far it's wonderful and finally after 6 years it's was worth the wait!
B00007KWI9|3.0|Obviously the reason I'm not rating the album higher is because I know extremely well just what Yes was capable of from 1970-1974.  Those were the best years of the bands career in my opinion (and hopefully the opinions of most!)    However, if we were to pretend those classic albums never occurred (WOW is *that* ever a hard thing to picture, haha- imagine if the classic years of Yes never even happened?  Talk about a tragic circumstance!) but uh.. where was I before I started rambling pointless, classic nonsense?  Oh yeah, if we pretend those classic albums never occurred (WOW is *that*... just kidding) it would be very easy for me to give in and allow this album to receive 4, if not 5 perfect stars.      The debut album by Yes has flaws *only* because I'm aware what the band went on to accomplish shortly after.  I think it's fair to base it on my experience with future Yes albums, and if it's not fair?  Well then, tough!  Life's not fair!  I never got what I wanted either!  That's not true, I was a pretty spoiled kid. :)    The best way to sum up the debut album by Yes is like this- do NOT expect tricky time signatures, numerous tempo changes, and the whole kitten kaboodle of everything we associate with the trademark style of Yes and progressive rock.  Throw it all out the window.  Be free!  Toss it out!  Feels good, doesn't it?  Alright, stop tossing.   STOP!  You destructive little monster!  You should be locked up for not knowing when to let up.  :)    The best song, without a doubt, is \\"Survival\\".  Why?  Why is it the best song?  The soulful vocal melody of Jon Anderson.  I'm not even a fan of his singing skills (or his bland vocal range) and he normally doesn't sing soul in my view, however none of that matters in the slightest because the vocal melody blows me away.  It makes me want to search for the heavenly silver star twinkle across the snowy fields and mountains.  It's extremely good, and let me tell you a personal secret- it's not often I say a Jon Anderson vocal melody is extremely good.  I don't like to.  I refuse, just like I used to close my mouth when my mom tried inserting broccoli in there!  I refused to accept stinky things then, and I refuse now.  :)    There's not a lot of sweetness is \\"Sweetness\\".  Unless it's supposed to be short and sweet with a simple vocal melody.  Well okay then- in that respect, it works.  Otherwise, burnt Christmas cookies are sweeter (and I've had my share of those over the years... ugh- why do cookies always burn on the bottom first?  Why don't cooks actually check the bottom of cookies to make sure they're done to prevent them from becoming burnt?  Don't just open the door and look at them- actually LIFT THEM UP!  Don't just assume they're done because the top is done!  It's too late then!!!)      I'm working backwards apparently because my next selection of discussion is going to be to describe \\"Every Little Thingy\\".  No, it can't stand in the same league as the Beatles version.  Then again, the psychedelic intro/guitar jam is quite the marvelous treat!  I bet the Beatles were thinking \\"Yo man, what's up with that?\\" but with a British accent obviously.    WOW, I love when the guitar solo comes in shortly after the 1-minute mark.  Perfecto!  This is definitely what dramatically separates it from the Beatles version, and perhaps even surpasses it.  Nah, the Beatles have better vocals.  Better and warmer.      Oh now, come on!  A song like \\"I See You\\" is a disruptive little stink hazard.  I don't like the fruity vocals at all.  I might like them if you handed me a butterfly net and guided me to a field of carefree insects and blooming dandelions, but not in the confines of my computer room!  \\"La la la la la\\" oh man, just stop it.  STOP IT!!  It's not even funny, haha.  I bet Greg Brady liked it.  Anyway it tries to be jazzy but trying and failing are two separate things.  The light guitar jam at the end saves it from total stinkiness, so let us show an abundance of thankfulness for that.  Otherwise, I can name a few cow fields that smell worse than this.    \\"Harold Land\\" reminds me of Kansas.  The band members of Kansas must have known about this song.  They simply must!  If not, well, get out of Kansas!  Don't be so secluded!  It's a big world out there, hehe.  I mention Kansas because the vocal melody sounds extremely similar to something they'd write such as on their Leftoverture album.   It's repetitive too, and that's not a good thing either.  Jon Anderson repeating the same vocal melody many times in a row?  Either something freaky is going on, or it's an unfocused debut album!      \\"Beyond and Before\\" (or \\"Before and Beyond\\" as my backwards brain insists on doing resulting in constantly changing it to the right way... and that's not true either!  I *really* want to call it \\"Bed & Breakfast!\\") has a vocal melody that takes me back to the late 60's.  I'm there man!   In a dingy smoke-filled room!  It's a really good vocal melody too.  I have nothing particularly comical to say about it.  \\"Say a few words to the wind?\\"  Okay that's funny.  I love it all the same, and I can definitely tell this is the same band that would write the melody to \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\".   \\"Looking Around\\" has a standard vocal melody that's just... okay.  No great shakes or freedom flowers.   \\"Yesterday and Today\\" is so harmless it mine as well not be here.      Overall, pick up everything Yes did from Time and a Word to Relayer *first* and then march your buns back here pronto and hear their debut.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|A creative and unique twist on Austen.  Die hard Austen fans might not care for this, but I thought it was good fun.
1596434252|5.0|This book is one of the most creative I've seen in the pop-up category. Virtually each letter is a surprise and a gift in and of itself. Anyone who is literary; a writer; a reader; in graphic design; an artist; or who harbors a child within will appreciate this book. Best for adults or mature children.
0439023521|4.0|I finished this book in two days. It is a moving book that really builds up the characters well, but doesn't challenge on a deeper level. It reads fast and has good action and vivid imagery. Good Vacation read or random read. It is also cool if one likes reading about post Apocalyptic and post America as we know it settings. All in all. Not bad.
0553801473|5.0|Dance with Dragons is a worthy successor in Martin's series (though I must say that I liked AFFC better than most people.) There are some caveats, as always. My main quibble is the unfinished plot threads (the past books have tended not to end on cliffhangers. ADWD is akin to ending right after the... shocking moments in A Game of Thrones, and a Storm of Swords especially. But at a length of almost 1,000 pages, I can understand why Martin chose to end it there. There are other quibbles  as well - for instance, the bleak tone (for which I love Martin, but a bittersweet novel must have at least a *bit* of sweet, no?), the much-ballyhooed death that almost nobody actually believes is permanent by this point (why end on a cliffhanger that everyone knows isn't one? Though if I am wrong in this case, it would be an interesting twist), etc.<br /><br />But in the end, it's easier to list what I don't love over the novel than what I do. I would put it on the same caliber as A Storm with Swords if only the author had extended the novel so it wasn't so filled with cliffhangers. I give it a 5/5 because 4/5 is frankly far too low (my rating would be something like 19/20, if more distinction were available.) Not as good as Martin's best writing, but an 'almost perfect' work by Martin is far far far better than most other authors can achieve.
B001YV502C|5.0|This movie is a sci-fi masterpiece. This movie actually makes something of itself and asks the Audience to participate in what is going on in the story. Brain candy film making can be fun to watch, but a real \\"FILM\\" is rare and a treat to all the senses if you choose to use them. The subtlety in the acting, the use of high and low art in the same scenes, the despair turned to hopeful awe. The world felt real and familiar adding to the danger and Clive Owen wasn't a superman hero coming to save the day, but a real man who cowered away from violence and jumped at the sound of gunfire.  You could smell this world it was so realized.  I was very immersed in the story and on the edge of my seat the entire time. This is a 5 star movie. I recommend it to any sci-fi fan.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Lucas and Spielberg? How can it be? I am so shocked and disappointed at how bad this film is. I used to love these movies growing up and can't understand why they put this out with seeming no effort, no passion, amateur effects and terrible acting. Even Cate Blanchett was a disaster in this film, with her cheeso Russian accent. From 10 minutes into the film, my husband and I were talking about how bad it was. We tried to stick it out to the end but it only got worse and we shut it off 3/4 of the way through. Not even tolerable to finish.  It actually had a low budget feel to it.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|It was better than I expected and the controls were actually decent not a whole lot of lag (was underclocked to 800 mhz). My only qualm is that the campaign is too short, way too short. I downloaded the game 20 minutes ago and I already beat it. It could be on par with Plants vs Zombies, Peggle, and Angry Birds but they need to add more levels and maybe improve the dialogue.
1451629184|5.0|I thought about my closeness to Ms. Dugard's own age throughout this book. I had frequently prided myself on being 'strong' when I was a pre-teen.<br /><br />But truthfully, I never imagined being captured/tortured by two psycopaths: My world then consisted of makeup and boy-bands. And I believed that the world was a relatively safe place.<br /><br />I only knew of one friend who had been abused by their parents. They were quickly whisked away to safety, so the system theoretically 'worked'. Oh, how sheltered and naive those ruminations were. Our generation was not at all safe.<br /><br />Writing this book is (understandably) very courageous of Dugard. It does not provide easy reading, and I actually skipped over entire sections.<br /><br />I was initially interested in seeing if she actually wrote about the State of California's missed prior opportunities to catch the Garrido's. I hope that the parole officers responsible for these serious errors are severely penalized. Focusing on her personal experiences, the book does not delve into this, instead using a 'first-person' approach to show people what living under such unsusual and cruel circumstances was actually like.<br /><br />However, the story is told so readers can actually skip sections and still successfully come away with the basic thrust of the author's survival. People would not be missing much of the plot. Against/under great personal adversity, human beings are resilent creatures. Jaycee bonded with pets as a 'coping' strategy while locked away in the maze of sheds and later worried about the fate of her daughters.<br /><br />The story itself will not make you feel 'good', and it is not actually supposed to. It is not really a book which people are supposed to come away enjoying.  But knowing that Jaycee and her offspring are now safe is trully the happy ending after all of the garbage and abuse which they endured.<br /><br />It would be a suitable personal purchase or maybe for a counselor collection who specialized in recovery from abuse.
0670022411|1.0|Let me preface this review, with, I do NOT get offended.  I am not the type of person that gets offended by a person smoking or cursing, or a zealot who believes something different than I.  I fully accept everyone's ability to be who they want, and just focus on the things I like.<br /><br />To add, this is my first review, ever.  I rarely feel strongly enough to project my opinion on others (in writing).  I have gone to bed each night since completing this book fighting with the wording of my review, and finally decided to actually submit one.<br /><br />I am offended by, \\"A Discovery of Witches\\".<br /><br />It is offensive for many reasons, primarily because it portrays an educated smart young lady giving up her life, her family and any control she had of her life to a man.  She no longer can think for herself, do anything on her own, or make any sort of decision, because this man has entered her life, and does all of that for her.  It is sad that this is written by a woman, and most people that are reviewing this in a positive light are women.<br /><br />It is offensive, because as many beautiful works sit idly by on some editor's desk (if they are lucky), someone that has decided to blantantly ride the coattails of another series becomes a best seller?  This story line lacks creativity or imagination, it is sad, tired and overdone, with nothing new or of any interest add.<br /><br />Perhaps, I will write a insipid novel, add some vampires and magic, it will fly though some money gruber editor's hand, and will be touted as the next Harry Potter by some lazy marketer, and I will have my name on the world's next great rip off.<br /><br />I was offended.  I am still offended.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Finally a new thriller with great careful screenwriting behind it!  After all the \\"same old, same old....\\" lately - definitely worth buying.  Great film, great actors.
0061134007|5.0|His first and one of his best. A few annoying items like references to rifles that never existed and a few other factual misses does not significantly detract from a complex, multi-dimensional  (yet surprisingly easy to follow), thoroughly enjoyable story. When I read the Redbreast I felt like I was walking the streets of Oslo, seeing, hearing, smelling, and feeling the things that the characters in pages did.
0670824399|5.0|This was my favorite book growing up- and now that I'm teaching 4th and 5th grade, I have implemented it as a required read. From a teacher's prospective, it offers great vocabulary word options, good thinking opportunities for kids, and invokes a fantastic desire for students to read it! From a reader's prospective, it is hilarious- with lots of laugh-out-loud moments that children and adults can both relate to. Dahl plays up a child's view of adult enemies and how to conquer them with intelligence. I love it!

0553386794|5.0|Starts with a bang and keeps going.<br />There is plenty of action and intrigue in this book but most of all it is intelligent. There are enough twists in this book to fill a normal fantasy trilogy and a lot of intimations of future changes that could make all the politics and intrigue irrelevant.<br /><br />The main characters are all likeable or hateable as intended, the children are not the sulky, annoying brats used in a lot of novels, they are intended to be children of their culture brought up on violence and war where life can often end early so marrying at 13 and going to war at 15 aren't considered strange and we are completely sucked into their viewpoint.<br /><br />There are plenty of changes in direction as the book goes and there are a variety of plot threads to keep track of as they impact upon each other and we can never be sure of who is lying to who and to what end.<br /><br />A great start to the series.

0553801473|4.0|It has been SIX LONG YEARS since George R.R. Martin last released a book in his Song Of Ice And Fire Sequence. That's a pretty long wait.<br /><br />So was \\"A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five\\" worth the wait? Well... yes and no. It returns to much-beloved characters like Tyrion, Bran and Daenarys and slowly moves us toward the complex, treacherous endgame of Westeros' power struggles. But it's also very slow-moving, and sometimes it feels like events are happening too slowly.<br /><br />After killing his father, Tyrion flees his native land and ends up adrift in another, dependent on others for safety and shelter. So instead, he forges a new destiny for himself. Meanwhile, Bran is en route to the Wall, only to run into wargs and discover new facets of his mysterious skinchanging power.<br /><br />The new Night Watch commander Jon Snow finds himself facing an incoming horde of wildlings, as well as the presence of grouchy King Stannis and his bloodthirsty priestess Melisandre. Jon is determined to keep doing what he thinks is right, but his steadfastness may also be his undoing.<br /><br />Having conquered the city of Meereen, Daenarys starts learning the ropes of queenship there, as well as caring for her three rapidly-growing dragons. Of course, she soon discovers that it's a lot harder than it sounds, as she becomes enmeshed in a deadly tangle of love, treason, ambition and bloody murder.<br /><br />It's honestly hard to sum up a George R.R. Martin's books without giving away far too much, or going into countless detailed subplots. However, this book is very slow moving, and there isn't a lot of forward momentum until the last several chapters. It feels like Martin is arranging his vast chessboard for a the final clash, but it's going to be slow moving until he's done.<br /><br />However, for a Martin book, even moving forward slowly is a striking experience. He embroiders this bloodspattered tapestry with vivid poetic prose prose (\\"he fluttered like a burning leaf, a moth caught in a candle flame\\") mingled with sex, and quite a bit of gruesome violence handled very casually (when a man is beheaded, someone asks, \\"Can I have his boots?\\").<br /><br />The only very flawed scene that springs to mind is Daenarys' final scene, which is so melodramatic as to be almost silly. And yes, it ends on a multiple cliffhanger. Prepare to scream in frustration.<br /><br />As for the vast cast of flawed, intriguing characters, Martin only handles some of them -- we see more of Bran's burgeoning powers as he grows into a young man,  Jon's bleak, frustrating life as a commander, the ever-embittered Tyrion afloat without his family's influence, and Daenarys' quiet nature at war with her \\"dragon's blood.\\" Well, he touches on some of the other characters -- such as Cersei, who hits rock bottom -- but mostly focuses on those four. And without revealing too much, yet another much-loved character seems to have bitten the proverbial dust.<br /><br />\\"A Dance of Dragons\\" dances too slowly, but it's still a deeply absorbing read -- and it feels like George R.R. Martin is arranging the grand finale. Let's hope the next book doesn't take six years.ed like a burning leaf, a moth caught in a candle flame\\") mingled with sex, and quite a bit of gruesome violence handled very casually (when a man is beheaded, someone asks, \\"Can I have his boots?\\").<br /><br />The only very flawed scene that springs to mind is Daenarys' final scene, which is so melodramatic as to be almost silly.

0307593495|5.0|Title: The Troubled Man  Author: Henning Mankell  Publisher: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010    The engrossing Wallender series by Henning Mankell comes to a satisfying end with this final book, the eleventh in the internationally bestselling series. With each novel Kurt Wallender, the brilliant, brooding and introspective Swedish detective seems to get moodier and increasingly inward looking. In The Troubled Man, he is faced with tracing what turns out to be naval espionage activities during the Cold War days and coaxing four-decades old memories from people who were there at the time. The reason Wallender becomes involved is that his daughter's future father-in-law vanishes while on a stroll in Stockholm. Before he retired, the man was a high ranking officer in the Swedish navy. Wallender feels vulnerable having just turned sixty and needs to prove to himself that he's not failing by finding out what happened and, particularly, why. He worries through today's Swedish society and his own self-doubts while, in typical fashion, neglecting his health, his friends and his associates in order to sort out how the confounding jumble of events from today interact with the distant past. A must-read and one that, for readers who are not familiar with Mankell, will have them coming back for more Wallender fixes.
0545259088|4.0|Maggie Stiefvater's tales of winter werewolves have always been far more striking and poetic than any other werewolf books I can think of. And she brings the story of Grace and Sam to a close in \\"Forever,\\" a hauntingly bittersweet, sumptuously-written coming-of-age tale with a somewhat flawed finale.<br /><br />Spring has returned Grace to her human form, but she's still unstable -- she keeps turning back into a wolf and running into the woods. Sam has spent the whole winter waiting for her, despite the people of Mercy Falls thinking he's a budding serial killer. And Cole is hotly pursuing a cure for lycanthropy, using himself as a guinea pig.<br /><br />However, Sam and Grace's idyllic reunion is ruined by another death -- another girl is found savaged by a wolf (pretty obviously Shelby). Isabel's father arranges for the wolves to be exterminated (with HELICOPTERS), leaving the teens only a few days to lead the wolves to safety. Otherwise, Grace may be among the dead.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater is one of the rare young-adult authors who has lyrical, hauntingly lovely writing. Fragmented thoughts arrange themselves into minimalist poems, and mundane situations take on the delicate crystalline quality of a romantic dream (\\"it was just me, broken into pieces, slivered like glass, made into something new\\").<br /><br />\\"Forever\\" centers on three important subplots -- the need to save the wolf pack from Isabel's revenge-obsessed father, the quest for a lycanthropy cure (especially for Cole), and the teenagers shedding their childhood problems as they prepare to set out into adulthood. The story drifts along between these three subplots, with some bloody, tightly-paced action scenes (like the grand finale) woven in.<br /><br />And her characters are just as brilliant as her writing -- four troubled teenagers, who are breaking away from their pasts and their weird parents. Grace and Sam settle into an idyllic little world of their own, but are haunted by the hostility towards Sam and Grace's feelings about her parents. And Stiefvater spends a lot of time focusing on Cole and Isabel's tumultuous relationship, as Cole goes all brilliant mad scientist.<br /><br />One problem: the ending is rushed. Isabel, Cole and Grace take dramatic actions that seem like they should have massive consequences... but they don't. At all. Shouldn't Isabel's dad be having a rage-induced stroke or something?<br /><br />The payoff feels rushed and a little incomplete, but otherwise \\"Forever\\" is a striking, romantic little finale for Stiefvater's brilliant trilogy. This is everything \\"Twilight\\" failed to be.t her parents. And Stiefvater spends a lot of time focusing on Cole and Isabel's tumultuous relationship, as Cole goes all brilliant mad scientist.

B004J4WLPU|3.0|This book is written in a letter to her sister who has died. It jumps between present time in a letter and past when she is experience the event. It is a little hard to get used to in the begining but twards the end makes it more meaningful. I did not like the ending, but up in to that I thought i was good. I would recommend it and looking to read the follow-up book.
0399250395|3.0|The story if obviously delightful, however, the construction is pretty fragile for a child's book.  Things tear or get stuck and don't work-- much to a 3YO's dismay! Would not recommend.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I strongly dislike it when people don't review the product itself, rather their experience with the buyer.  Keep in mind items are represented on Amazon by many a seller ... so if the seller was poor, rate the seller, not the item!      I personally am not the biggest fan of the series (bought this for my girlfriend), the show is okay IMO, but that shouldn't play a role in this rating, should it? So I won't let it affect it.      Here we go.  5 (FIVE) STARS.  Based on the items description, there is no reason for me to rate it anything other than 5 stars.      Packaging (box and DVDs) is what they say and appear to be doing their job.  Box holding everything is sturdy.  The 40 DVDs are held in place well enough.  I know many feel that the DVDs are needlessly getting scratched, but I don't see how that becomes an issue provided you are careful taking them out and putting them back in.      All of the small extras, such as each of the 6 Friends being featured on a DVD holder and on the individual disks (all different photos on the DVDs themselves) is a nice feature.  Along with that, the obvious bonuses of the episode guides, documentaries, etc.. make for a nice round out to the set.      If you don't have many of the individual seasons as of now, this set is worth a good, hard, strong look considering its fair pricing, quality packaging, and all the extras it has to tie the entire series up into one nice boxed set.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Very cute story of love and redemption, but emotionally speaking not very different from other stories of love and redemption. The big realization and best thing about this book is that this is less a low brow story about a peculiarly human dog, and more about a non-human's view on the human experience. This is not to say that it's not for the dog-lover, but that there are many layers to the story. A bit predictable at times, but there are enough surprise to keep the story interesting.    Quick, easy read, but thought-provoking.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|My Chemical Romance has never disappointed me. I've never heard an album of theirs and thought: \\"This is just bad.\\" But I don't think I've ever been as excited about a MCR album as I was about this one. The second I got it, I started listening to it on full blast, all the way through, and I didn't stop for a week or so. I was pretty much in awe. This isn't just the best thing MCR has done ever, it may be the best album I've heard all year (or at least it's in the top 5).    There isn't any part of Danger Days that drags. It's fast-paced, it's fun, it's sometimes extremely touching. It has a concept that it sticks to throughout, but all of the songs could also make sense out of context. It's the kind of CD that you could listen to over and over and not be bored.     Danger Days shows a lot of musical talent, a great understanding of showmanship, even if it's just through speakers, songwriting ability, and fantastic focus on detail. It doesn't just tell a story, it creates its own world.It's sort of like they took everything they've ever tried to accomplish on an album and turned it up to 11. I, for one, am so impressed and thrilled that it exists.     I was planning on listing highlights of the album, but now I'm having trouble picking just a few. I'll give it a try though. The favorites of mine that really stood out for me were \\"Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back,\\" S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W,\\" \\"Summertime,\\" \\"Destroya,\\" and \\"The Kids From Yesterday.\\"
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I picked up Hunger Games on my Kindle for some light reading between The Help and Water for Elephants.  Being a 30 something mother of a toddler, reading does not happen at a rapid pace.  I was first introduced to this book by a colleague and I wanted to read it since they are filming the movie about an hour from my home.  Fun, easy, quick read...and it was...along with the other 2.  I had to download book 2 and 3 before I had even finished book 1.  I read all three in just under 8 days.  Keep in mind that is while I was on vacation with a 2 year old.  I never wanted to put it down.  Now comes the sad part.  I don't have any more of them to read : )

B003UESJEM|4.0|The Company Men is an interesting take on how the economic crash affected people around the country. The movie is centered around a Boston shipping conglomerate GTX. The directors lined up an all-star cast for The Company Men: Ben Afflict, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Costner, and Chris Cooper to name a few.<br /><br />The movie is enjoyable for what it is, a Hollywood movie. The Company Men doesn't pretend to be a documentary of historic events simply a unique take on the economic downturn. At times the movie to drag on, overall I like The Company Men and would watch it again.
0316098329|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read in my life. I'm sure I'll have nightmares for weeks. Even the seen in \\"The Lion,\\" where he killst he piolt on the plane was not as bad as this story was. Who could ever say it was the best book of the year?
0811870413|5.0|After seeing this in the local bookstore, I eventually gave in and bought a copy and was surprised to find out the recipe for bread is about 50 pages long and only takes 3 ingredients. And it takes at least two weeks to start. But the croissants looked so good, I decided to try it.  I'm really glad I did--it's by far the best bread I've ever made, and it ranks up there with the best bread I've ever eaten. After one failed attempt with a starter that wasn't ready, I worked through the country loaf and the baguette and finally to the croissants and they're well worth the trouble.  The book is very thorough, but I still had to learn a few things by experiment, like how long to grow the starter before you can make the first loaf (just over 2 weeks worked for me). And I'm still practicing the shaping. But it wasn't long before I was making great bread.  The other recipes are really good too. The book might be worth the price for the meatball sandwich recipe alone.    I'm so happy I bought this book--it took some practice, but it's a lot of fun and the bread and croissants are amazing.

B0038ZITHK|5.0|Carlitos Way is one of my favorite movies.  There is one thing I slightly dont like, and its that Sean Penns character can get kind of annoying throughout the movie.  But the persona of that character plays a role in the movie.  One thing about the Blu-Ray that stood out to me was the audio.  It sounds amazing.  During the club scenes where theyre inside Carlitos night club, with the music going, it sounds like youre really there!  I never owned the DVD, so I cant really compare the two, but the Blu-Ray is great.

B00005JLEU|4.0|This is the first time I've watched one of these movies by Miyazaki.  I've heard so much about them.  I've heard everybody praise them.  This movie was a little weirder than I expected.  Well, I guess I didnt really know what to expect coming in.  But all in all I enjoyed it.  I'll probably watch it again one of these day.  Also my niece and mother, who have never seen any japanese animation before, both liked it.
6300181278|5.0|This is the original Dracula film, at least with sound.  The semi-scary moments are there, but in good taste -- and far better than that string of similar plot movies that have been churned out ever since, with nothing but sickening scenes all the way though.  In the old days, we viewers were called on to exercise our imagination, not just sit and watch garbage.  I never cease to find that preferable to the eye.
B0000584V3|5.0|Any attempts to convey the all-encompassing glory of Opeth`s fifth studio LP Blackwater Park are futile and meaningless. To call it a masterpiece would be to insult it. On quiet mornings, I've been known to lay prostrate on my carpet with all the lights off and my headphones up all the way. Eliminate all distraction. Simply listen. In fact, \\"listen\\" is the wrong word. Absorb. Feast. Become.<br /><br />I can't remember exactly how my relationship with this album came to be. I prefer to imagine it finding me. I suppose I should make some effort at objectivity, so here goes. Technically, it's \\"Swedish death metal,\\" but I will not tolerate reductionism here. It is music. Beautiful music. Cynics would construct a barrier, placing guttural lion-like roaring on one side, and true musical beauty on the other. This album exists, unknowingly, to silence such foolishness -- and you will gasp for air when Mikael Åkerfeldt breaks into his true singing voice.<br /><br />Bristling with incredible jazz overtones, moments of quiet reflection, acoustic guitars, and classically composed piano movements, it will overwhelm you. Your palms will sweat. When the last note has sounded, and you reluctantly open your eyes, the world will have changed.<br /><br />Buy one for yourself. Buy one for your friends. Buy one for your enemies. Buy one for your grandmother. Buy one for your cat.
0399250573|5.0|Warning....Spoiler...Warning.... spoiler  I've warned you.  In my opinion, through out the series, Alex was completly unemotional. He wasn't really upset when his uncle died in the first book and through out his adventures he wasn't too fazed about being kidnapped or hurting other people.It really annoyed me how inhuman he was. So, I was quite happy when he actually felt some emotions in this book.  Thats not to say I was happy when Jack died. It was very depressing,(I cried for an hour straight). But I think it was necessary to prove a point- that Alex shouldn't have ever been involved in MI6.  Unlike others, I think the plot was completly original and very creative.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I pre-ordered the book for my kindle and read it in two days. The book is graphic at moments and really helps you to see what twisted people Phillip and Nancy are. I can only say that Jaycee is one inspiring individual who in spite of going through 18 years of hell, has actually taken the timw to look at the bright side of situations and she speaks as if she was never a victim, which is truly amazing. Get the book and read the book, it's worth the money and time.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|My expectations were very high with this release (I saw the Exit...Stage Left show in Lakeland FL back in the day!)  and while I was disappointed in some aspects of the 5.1 treatment (the Stereo mix has the original elements by the  way and sounds great) there were enough surprises to make up for this to at least some degree.    Disappointments:  1 Red Barchetta is missing the side chain compressor on the intro of the guitars      (that beautiful stereo chorused breathing as the drums start kicking in and triggering          the clean guitar comp - this very distinct & important heebee geebee factor is just gone)  2 Vocals needed to be narrower (more centered) in spots or entire songs (some play in it maybe etc...)  3 Not enough reverb for the vocals as in the original (The Camera Eye is just to dry and wide)  4 The double/triple tracked drums are mostly missing in Witch Hunt (losing strength as a result - Toms)  5 The intro drum sequence in Witch Hunt is simply trashed - it had to have been edited (missing notes!)  6 Instrumentation in surround channels (other than drums already there etc...) should have been ramped in more so      (Red Barchetta synth pads etc... - too abrupt)  7 Not enough LFE, most of the bass is in the front speakers (on a calibrated system anyway)  8 The entire Tom Sawyer demo version please? (check out the specials of Classic Albums: 2112 / Moving Pictures)  9 5.1? Blu-ray? Come on man - do it the right way - (24 bit 96kHz) 7.1 LPCM - period. Hmph.  10 No consultation with Terry Brown who originally helped make the album what it was to begin with?    Surprises:  1 Bass guitar is just beautiful sounding esp. on Red Barchetta   2 Extra (or louder anyway) harmony vocals in Limelight  3 Clean guitars in Limelight are modernised  4 The Camera Eye detail in the sound effects  5 Synth padding is very pristine  6 Cymbals are very pristine as well as Toms in the surround field  7 Good frequency balance (with a little raise to the LFE)  8 Extra (or louder anyway) vocals in Witch Hunt  9 Vital Signs has really nice & subtle surround effects  10 Video for Vital Signs as I remember it from the heyday of MTV      Overall it is a really good and tight mix with the extra takes/tracks/volume I have picked up on  being nice and neat to hear as well but this could have been something more (In The End).
B000UJ48VI|4.0|This movie has a loose interpretation to the novel Lolita in the sense that the time in history at which this film was produced was different than that of today's world. For instance, there is not as much sex in this film as is in the book Lolita. Stanley Kubrick begins the film with his signature ending-first directing style. For something that was made in the 1960's, Kubrick gets away with a lot that could be taken as borderline decency. One small piece of evidence to this is the name change of \\"Camp Q\\" to \\"Camp Climax\\". It is true that this setting of the novel was on Lake Climax, but in all seriousness, the change is a method of foreshadowing the symbolic lack of adolescent purity that the main character, Humbert, has a strong fetish for. There are some minor changes from the book in terms of its conclusion as well as its beginning. The film completely leaves out the psychosis factor of Humbert's own adolescent sexual experiences and how it causes him to develop his obsession for nymphets. It is definitely worth seeing, as this is one of Kubrick's earlier works, as well as a good interpretation of Nabokov's story.
031603441X|3.0|Honestly, I was disappointed by this book.  I found it overly gossippy.  And maybe \\"self- serving\\" is not the right word, but I found this book to include a major attempt by Keith to do some retroactive PR and to rationalize his every action.  For example:<br /><br />1. Keith tries very hard to show himself as just a regular bloke, to whom the money doesn't really matter--just the music.  But  as hard as Keith tries to avoid it, repeated references to the chateaus in France to the Rolls Royces, continually creep in.<br /><br />2.  Keith tries to present himself as the loyal, true blue Rolling Stone--in contrast to Mick, who Keith paints as the self-centered one. To make his reality consistent with his self image, Keith has to rationalize his taking Anita from Brian Jones by blaming Brian, rather than Keith taking any responsibility whatsoever.<br /><br />To me, this is clearly a case of Keith believing his own PR, with his ghost writer apparently afraid or unwilling to set the record straight.<br /><br />Truly, what I really wanted from this book was more about the music--not the drugs, not Keith's oneupmanship with Mick, not screaming female fans, not the lifestyle, but music.  Certainly, there was some of that, just not nearly enough.  Hence the 3 stars--a middling review for a middling effort.

0618918248|4.0|This book is aimed at what Dawkins sees as a growing population of closeted non-believers -- people who associate themselves with a religion or profess some vague spirituality, but don't, in their heart of hearts, really believe that there's a God. The God Delusion is his attempt to empower that population to take the small step to unapologetic, open atheism.  Dawkins begins by building a strong case that the traditional Judeo-Christian idea of God (as opposed to a more universal, philosophical concept of God, which he deals with less effectively) -- a supernatural being who created the forms of life on Earth, hears and responds to our prayers, brought about specific miracles and signs, directly communicated with scripture writers, wishes us to subscribe to specific beliefs and values, and preserves our personalities beyond the death of the brain that generates them for reward or punishment in some afterlife -- is unsupported by scientific evidence or logic. According to him, the main reason people DO believe has nothing to do with the rational validity of Christianity and Islam's claims, and everything to do with the huge social and political influence that the world's major religions continue to wield, the emotional power of their myths, and the simple fact that many of us never really examine why we believe what we believe.  Dawkins has been accused of being \\"scornful\\", but I felt that his manner was more probing and frank than mean-spirited -- the same way he would no doubt rebut a scientific hypothesis. As an agnostic with a Christian upbringing, I found that his eloquent criticisms of religion's more superstitious aspects expressed many of my own reasons for growing disillusioned with faith and dogma when I was in college. Outdated myths... check. Lack of evidence... check. The oppression and cruelty of fundamentalism... check. Its close-mindedness, the inconsistency of its morals, its many conflicts with science and a rational worldview, the endless human effort and blood wasted on pitting equally flawed belief systems against one another -- check, check, check, check. He makes a very good case, at the least, that society shouldn't shy away from honest discussion of religion's faults and flaws.  Without a doubt, Dawkins is a dyed-in-the-wool atheist, and he doesn't stop with religion itself, but lays assault to what he calls \\"belief in belief\\" -- the conviction among more wishy-washy non-believers (such as myself) that faith in a God has a benevolent side that's still worthy of respect. He systematically turns his guns on the arguments commonly used to justify religion: that it's necessary for morality, that it provides meaning and happiness, that it's compatible with science, that it's part of American government, that it deserves respect for the sake of cultural diversity (though he's careful to emphasize that he's in favor of teaching ABOUT various faith systems, since they're integral to understanding history and literature).  In general, I earlier parts of the book stimulating and well-argued, though I thought Dawkins went a little too far in later chapters on \\"culture war\\" issues, producing a self-righteous tirade against faith propelled more by smugness than data. Not the way to defeat the emotional needs that draw many people to churches, temples, and mosques. I also didn't appreciate his dismissive, \\"you've got enough data, pick one side or the other\\" challenge to agnostics and the \\"spiritual but not religious\\". And a commenter to my review indicated that he's a bit presumptuous in including certain famous thinkers, such as Carl Sagan, in his camp. Finally, I don't agree with his easy disposal of ultimate questions -- when considering an infinite, eternal chain of universes, there's simply no way for the human intellect to explain its origins, whether through top-down Creation or bottom-up Evolution. There's no reason to believe that this cosmic continuum doesn't contain god-like entities, that we aren't part of some larger universal consciousness, or that the laws of the greater multiverse, beyond our small, localized window of awareness, are remotely within our ability to understand. I still believe in transcendence and transcendent experience.  However, while Dawkins didn't cure me of my agnosticism, this book helped put it in clearer perspective. For other readers, if you're an atheist, an agnostic, a deist, a pantheist, or one of Dawkin's closeted skeptics, you'll probably get something out of The God Delusion, including more confidence to speak your mind. If you're an open-minded religious person, I think you will come away with a better understanding of the factors that draw thoughtful non-believers to atheism, which I hope you will contemplate with honesty. I think there remains plenty of room for debate about God as an abstract metaphysical concept, but this book offers an effective and, given the increasing politicization of religion, necessary challenge to superstition.
B004EPZ084|2.0|Three friends come together and decide to eliminate their respective work supervisors, whom they all hate, for different reasons. This is another in a long line of modern-day comedies containing coarse language throughout, which does have its place (see Superbad), but at times is used to replace good comedy. In this case, the problem I have with the film is that it just isn't as funny as it should be. The movie has a strong cast, and they almost make it work. The movie does have its moments, but when the outtakes during the closing credits are funnier than the movie you just watched, you know that it was not all that good.

B003AWRMCE|1.0|This movie wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  And the fact that it won the Oscar for best picture tells me that the competition that year was extremely weak.  But it wasn't.  This movie beat out \\"A Few Good Men\\" which is a travesty.  It is one of those movies where you really know nothing about the main characters for 1 hour 45 minutes and then the final 15 minutes of the film is for the big reveal.
1451629184|5.0|What struck me the most reading this, especially the early parts, is just how innocent and truly young Dugard was when she was abducted.  She truly did not understand what was happening to her.  I think people see this grown woman now and forget that she was only eleven when her life was thrown totally off course.  People forget what it was like to be eleven years old--how impressionable and malleable you are at that age.  Nothing in this world could prepare an eleven year old child for what these people did to her.  I read this memoir in one day.  Dugard's heart and spirit really come through in every page--her essence--and she is a remarkable and beautiful soul.  There is so much to learn from her story.  Her story is heartbreaking. Literally at times I felt nauseous and weepy and at other times enraged.  I wanted to gather that little girl in my arms and make everything okay.  I also wanted to do very not nice things to all the evil and uncaring people who hurt and failed her over the years. It's truly amazing to me that after all she's endured she ends this memoir on such a hopeful note. She is an example to all of us.  Read this and you'll be absolutely appalled at all the things you take for granted.  I wish her and her family so many wonderful things.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I started this book yesterday and couldn't put it down until it was finished.  I think most people know the story of what happened to Jaycee but this is her account... in her own words... as she recalls it.   So while I won't rehash the basis of the story, I will tell you what surprised me the most...  which were her personal reflections throughout the book.  This is where she would break from telling the past and reflect on how she feels about it now, in hindsight, what therapy has helped her realize, etc etc.  These are the parts that show her courage, her personal determination, her strength...  things you don't see in a short media frenzied news story.  So while parts of the book are hard to read, this is not someone just trying to recount the horrors of what happened to them in order to make a quick buck... no, this is a story to help other people see survival is possible... healthy survival from the the most horrible tragedies.   It also shows how therapy can be healing if you have a good therapist and a willing patient to help the healing process.  She could have allowed this tragedy to define her, to make her angry and bitter, to retreat into a life of expecting everyone to cater to her because she was \\"owed\\" something for what happened to her.... but she doesn't do that.... far from that... in fact, she is thankful for life, she decided not to allow the horrible couple who did this to her have one iota of control over her anymore, she is focused on helping her daughters make successful life choices... she's an inspiring woman.  Highly recommend this book!
0060936223|5.0|I normally don't review the books I read. But Patti Smith's memoir of her love affair and friendship with Robert Mapplethorpe was so moving that I had to say something.  It is wonderfully written and so tender about her relationship with Mapplethorpe that you can physically feel her pain when he passes away.  I lived in New York at the same time they did and her memories of the city at that time are evocative of a particular moment when New York was filled with excitement, creativity and a certain joy.  Bravo, Patti.  Thank you for writing this.
0439023513|2.0|SOME SORT-OF SPOILERS IN HERE  This is a sadly bad and rushed-feeling ending to a page-turner; it left me angry for being let down. I don't mind an unhappy or ambiguous ending, but one that is simply weak is inexcusable. My main complaint is that although the main character is portrayed as a strong, proactive protagonist throughout the series, and although she is present as the final events go down, she has basically nothing to do with any of them and is in fact completely helpless through the last half or so of the book, if not the entire thing. The story remains exciting and full of action and violence, but what a let-down when you realize that Katniss's struggles through three books are all futile in very important ways; she may be (barely) alive, bad guys may be defeated, but the character traits of fortitude and control she supposedly fought for -- and that seem to be major developing themes in the novels -- seem to be an illusion (not unattainable -- just missing) and the reader feels misled. You are led to ask what the point was of all the excitement and, frankly, of reading the trilogy. Even those who applaud the Girl Power aspect of the book must feel really hollow inside, because the main character remains a helpless pawn.     I hope the author comes out with an alternate third book in which Katniss, who is portrayed throughout as an action-taker struggling to control her own life and future, actually takes action on any level and controls these -- and especially that the movie corrects this very weak and cynical ending.    Reading other reviews here, I see I agree with Ilana on pretty much all points.
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|Movie is definitely reminiscent of Liam Neeson's hit \\"Taken\\" but with more plot and character development as opposed to the non-stop action of \\"Taken\\". I disagree with reviewers who claim there was not enough action. Taken was slightly unbelievable with the main character a virtual killing machine, mowing down everything that got in front of him. Neeson's character in this film was much more believable, apparently lacking the ability to kill everything that walks. The surprise twist was an efficient way to tie the questions in the plot together and add a sense of \\"danger\\" to Neeson's character. While its not the greatest action adventure I've ever seen, it is definitely worth the cost of the DVD.

0553801473|2.0|It's not that A Dance With Dragons is a bad book.  Its fine. The problem is that it suffers from the same problems as A Feast for Crows.  I had hoped that with the reintroduction of some of the most beloved characters in the series, and with the generally cooler reception of Feast, its flaws would be lacking. Sadly, that is not the case.<br /><br />Flaws include meandering, often repetitive, chapters, the introduction of characters I personally developed little care for (and seemed were introduced a little late in the game for me to take seriously and, more damning, appeared to accomplish nothing) and the general sense that Martin has lost control of his story.  Some motivations driving characters are revealed and they appear to not really conform to how those characters were last portrayed 11 years ago.  Where once Martin would use one chapter, well placed in the middle of a dramatic sequence, to set forth the developments of the story, now several chapters tell the same tale. There is no truly wonderful mental picture drawn in your head as there was in the first and third books especially. It also seems the editors were in such a rush to profit that they did not completely edit and were so desperate to put something out there that they did not call Martin on a story that has lost its focus.<br /><br />That being said, the book is not all bad. Martin's writing style is still largely intact.  Most particularly the end chapters had some of the flair of the first three books.  Still it is clear that Martin needs to work on tightening his chapters. He desperately needed an outline.<br /><br />The tale is still progressing but don't expect the wizardry of the first three books.
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|I ordered this product on a monday afternoon and it was delivered to me by Wednesday. For $9 it is worth it.

Lastly it does not  make the phone to big or bulky as I feared it would.
0802473156|5.0|Often, when I buy a self help book, I end up starting and never really finishing it or getting in to it.  This book, however, has been quite different.  It flows and is a very easy read without a lot of difficult jargon and has really opened my eyes.  Yes, once you read this book it will seem like pure common sense, but it has diffused my anger at others (such as in-laws) and other people close to me.  For example, it drives me nuts that certain individuals are CONSTANTLY showering my children with gifts but now I understand WHY.  For me, it doesn't not speak love while for others, it is their way of showing their love.  It is also helped me to understand myself in ways I SHOULD have already known; I understand, now, why I have felt so lonely at times in my marriage.  If you are having a disconnect with a loved one, someone who you know loves you but you always wonder why they don't \\"show\\" it...this is the book for you.  In addition, I thought that I would skip the repeat books, such as the one for understanding your children, because I thought they would probably be redundant.  However, I now think I will be buying that particular book as I can already see how one of my children is more of a physical touch type person and would love to explore these ideas further for showing my children love in their own languages.
B001DF68MA|5.0|My two year old LOVES this bike seat! I was initially pleased to see a forward-mounting seat, and even more pleased with the price and quality of this item.     There was no learning curve for my little guy, and when my husband rides around with him, my little guy is very happy and comfortable; he has a \\"front row\\" seat with this bike seat, and that HAS to be better than having to stare at Daddy or Mommy's back during the ride.    I HIGHLY recommend this bike seat.
0757302661|4.0|This book has a lot of great relaxation techniques, even if you aren't big into self hypnosis. I struggled to fully immerse myself in some of the hypnosis, but the scripts and visualizations were still a HUGE help. I also bought the Bradley method book, and took a Lamaze class which came with a book. Of all of the methods, this one had the highest quantity and quality of relaxation techniques. If you're looking for birth education go elsewhere, but if your looking for good ideas and practice for the big day and coping with pain, I'd choose this over the other two programs in a heart beat.   The only thing that would make this better would be to include a better cd. The cd included in the book isn't as helpful and relaxing as I hoped it would be. I expected it to be more like yoga music or something to guide your relaxation.
034537410X|5.0|In my pursuit for obtaining lucid dreaming, I've read 4 books so far on lucid dreaming. Out of all the books I've read, one stands out the most which is this one right here. It's the most accurate, reliable,non-speculative, book that I've read so far on lucid dreaming. Other lucid dreaming books kinda guess at certain parts what they think and speculate things that aren't proven. This one is written in a more scientific approach which easily, in my opinion, makes it the most legitimate one to read. I suggest, to anyone who wants to get involved with lucid dreaming, to start off with this book.
0670022411|2.0|While Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness has an alluring premise, interesting historical undertones and intriguing elements of mystery, the too-too-too syrupy romance between Diana and Matthew is a bit stomach turning.  Elements of suspense are too quickly resolved leaving the reader wanting something more than vampire mating rituals.  A good summer read but not a substantial find.
0553801473|5.0|Simply phenomenal.  I cannot understand what the negativity is all about.  We waited a long time, but the book was worth the wait.  Am I excited about the possibility of waiting for more?  No.  However, we should be rating this book on it's merit, and that is very high.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I bought this book for my friend Regina Rudolph. She's written five novels all of which are available on Amazon.com   The first thing she did was reduce the price of her five adult romance novels to just 99 cents each. Now she's beginning to promote her books in the way John Locke promoted his.   I've read three of Locke's novels and he's one heck of a novelist. If Regina follows his advice in this book, she can afford to buy all my books in the future. So please search Regina Rudolph in the Kindle Store and help me get my books for free from Regina.
B00003CX96|1.0|This is one of my favorite movies. However the color is way off. For example the University of Indiana football team appears to be wearing blue helmets. The people's face and skin all appear to have blues tones, and the red corvette looks purple. For me the movie was ruined.
B001VZY4MS|4.0|I'd bet many people who consider themselves avid Neil Young fans don't know this album even exists.  They should.  Not only is it an important milestone in his career, but it's completely unique.  There's simply nothing else in his catalog that sounds remotely like it.  Leslie-ed guitars?  Growling B-3 organ?  Gospel choir?  Jazzy electric piano?  Bright, chiming guitars?  Instrumentals, and leading off both sides of the album at that?  This is Neil Young?  Well, yeah, it is, and mostly, it's pretty interesting.    The record isn't without familiar NY traits --- fuzzy guitars, and Neil's quirky voice and cryptic lyrics.  But it's the things mentioned above that get your attention.  Neil had a pretty nice backlog of songs built up for this record, which he started even before the last Buffalo Springfield album was released.  At times he seems unsure of just how to arrange some of these songs, and maybe that's what led to these arrangements being so uncharacteristic of his subsequent work.  But it pretty much all works.    \\"The Emperor of Wyoming\\" could be a movie theme (and wasn't it originally intended to be?).  \\"If I Could Have Her Tonight\\" is bright and Beatle-esque.  \\"The Old Laughing Lady\\" is notable for its jazz/gospel interlude.  And for me, \\"I've Been Waiting for You\\" is one of Neil's best rockers, remarkable given that it was recorded in several different studios in different cities.    The only real clunker here is the closer, \\"The Last Trip to Tulsa\\".  It's funny, because back in the day, this Neil-Does-Desolation-Row tome was considered the album's highlight.  But it hasn't aged well, and you might find yourself skipping it upon repeated listings of the album.  Everything before it is quite worthy, however.    After this album's release, Neil complained publicly that he didn't like the sound of it, and had it remixed and remastered.  I preferred one song from the original.  \\"Here We Are In the Years\\" had a more interesting (if muddy) mix, and more importantly, ran to its natural end, a glorious descent to a full stop rather than the wimpy early fadeout of the remaster.  The fadeout was a bad decision on Neil's part, robbing the song of its momentum at the end.    \\"Neil Young\\" is clearly transitional, but fascinating nonetheless.  NY fans who don't have it will find it a surprise, and a worthwhile investment.    A footnote: it was while recording this album that Neil acquired his \\"Old Black\\" 1953 Les Paul.  He swapped one of his Gretsches to Jim Messina for it.  Messina, who plays bass on this album, later labelled the trade a mistake on his part.

0553801473|2.0|Yawn. Let me preface this by saying that I am a long-time Martin fan. I do not want my negative review to be discounted by those who will say I am a 'detractor.'<br /><br />[Background]<br /><br />I was first introduced to his work via Fevre Dream which I found in a used book store. That led me to search for more books of his and then I discovered A Song of Ice and Fire. I have waited a long time for this series to end, though perhaps not as long as many others. When I started reading, A Game of Thrones was in paperback and A Clash of Kings came out a few months later. I remember the days when GRRM used to chat with fans on AIM (something I appreciated greatly) and watched with despair as he succumbed to the pressures of his so-called 'detractors.' As a reader, I, too, was disappointed by the long wait. I agonized over it for a few months, but chose to read other fantasy novels instead of trolling him on the internet. I really, really wanted to like this book. I didn't expect much, but I felt that surely, after all this time, he had been able to get the series back on track. With the deaths of some major characters in Storm of Swords, and the criticisms of the slow pace of Feast for Crows, he had to have pared back and regained focus, right? Wrong.<br /><br />[Review]<br /><br />Pros:<br />(1) His prose is what it's always been: descriptive, lush, vivid and, at times, graphic. I don't want to spoil for anyone who hasn't read yet, but some of the chapters were so vile I felt uneasy for several hours after reading them. Though they were powerful, I'm still not convinced that the level of detail was necessary, and I still find myself wondering what exactly this added to the *overall* plot (i.e., not just the plot of ADWD, but of ASoIaF in general).<br /><br />(2) The characters who many longed for (myself included) in AFFC are featured in ADWD. This, for me, actually turned out to be a bit of a con (more on that later). Nevertheless, it cannot be said that GRRM doesn'tattempt to advance the plot and pick up where he left off in Book 3. His idea of plot advancement and mine must be two different things, however, as many of the characters take only one small step forward and several leaps back.<br /><br />(3) Bran. Those chapters are a pro in and of themselves. GRRM has said in the past that he had difficulty writing the younger kids, but I think he did a masterful job with Bran's chapters in Dance.<br /><br />(4) It's out. It's published. That's positive in and of itself, right?<br /><br />Cons:<br />(1) I don't want to rate Martin lowly for not doing what I want with his characters. Of course I'd love to see things play out differently, but then they would be my books and not his.<br /><br />On the other hand, I feel that in this chapter of the series, GRRM has given up on the novel and revolutionary plot twists for which he is lauded in exchange for shock value and contrived (and over-used) fantasy tropes. The introduction of a \\"new\\" character, one with little to no foreshadowing, albeit one who GRRM never fully admitted was deceased seemed like a desperate attempt to misdirect readers from the popular theory that Jon Snow is the progeny of Rhaegar and Lyanna as well as the hope that Dany will one day take back the Seven Kingdoms. In short, don't expect any game-changers of the Ned Stark or Red Wedding type in this book.<br /><br />(2) The introduction of new plot threads (again, don't want to spoil) that seem, at best, tangential to the arc begun in AGoT, or, at worst, the start of new plots upon ploys upon plots. I'm all for intrigue and suspense, but of all the novels, Feast included, this is the shortest and least satisfying on both accounts.<br /><br />(3) At the end of the book I'm left with many of the same questions I had at the end of Feast. And yes, I realize this book could (and should) be seen as the second volume of Feast. However, there is and was nothing in either SoS or AFFC that led me to believe that little tonothing would be resolved in ADWD for characters like Jon, Dany, and Tyrion. All the setup in ASoS about the glorious and troubled Targaryen past led to...not much. What happened to the immersive fantasy of the first three (and some of the fourth) books? It's lost between descriptions of food and animals and travelogues. The world, for even the high and mighty, is full of nothing but lowlifes and shallowness.<br /><br />(4) Dany. While GRRM hasn't gone the Cersei route with her quite yet, she is a far cry from the strong and certain khaleesi. Then again, for all his innovations, GRRM, like many (male?) authors of today seems to have a problem with strong female characters who aren't ugly or undead. A woman's who's all that and brains too doesn't seem to exist in high fantasy.<br /><br />tl;dr: I can't say I hated it, but I definitely didn't like it, and not for the standard \\"OMG he didn't do what I wanted him to do with my characters\\" reasons. Save your money and wait for the paperback or local library edition.

0345528581|5.0|I was looking for a complete workout program based on bodyweight exercises, and came across this book. I was experimenting with the program while traveling around the world, when I did not have access to any modern exercise equipment.<br /><br />You Are Your Own Gym is a great read and particularly inspiring. It presents information you will not typically find in most fitness books.<br /><br />First comment:<br /><br />The workouts are absolutely challenging if you follow them exactly as laid out by the author! In 20 minutes you will get an impressive workout, and in fact will probably be sore for days after the first one.<br /><br />Note to beginners: If you don't have an established weight-training routine you would be well advised to seriously tone down the 10-week workout plans by creating your own routine based on the exercises and the concepts in this book. Even if you try to follow the most basic 10-week program you will be absolutely wiped out if you don't have enough serious built-up fitness.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- The best thing about the book is it's laid out like a a recipe guide. First, you have the 100+ exercises covering every part of the body. Then, you have the various types of training, such as ladders, intervals, etc., with ideas that I've never heard before. For example, a ladder with pushups would be like this:<br /><br />* Do 1 pushup, rest for the same amount of time it took you to do the pushup. Do two pushups, rest again for the same period of time. Do three pushups, rest. Do four pushups, rest. Continue until you feel you've reached your \\"max\\" but can still come down all the way to zero. For example, if you reach 12 pushups, then after you do 11, then 10.<br /><br />This method of training will really workout your muscular endurance like nothing you've tried before. However, it's not the best to build sheer strength, so the author has other methods to build your strength. The trick is to alternate these training methods, and to cover different body parts every day.<br /><br />- You can pick and choose to create your own training programs<br /><br />- You can follow the training programs as laid out by the author, but they are challenging!<br /><br />- There's lots of exercise beyond the typical pushups, many of which you've never heard of.<br /><br />- You can do the exercises everywhere with almost all of the exercises. This is a great program if you like to workout outside in a part or while traveling.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Not many, but:<br /><br />- The book lacks a \\"super basic\\" workout program for people who are not in shape. Therefore, if one is just getting started, he or she cannot realistically complete the basic 10-week program.<br /><br />- Some exercises, like the \\"lift me up,\\" require equipment that is not always available. You can improvise with what you can find, but in some cases you can't find anything suitable. However, you can substitute an exercise for another easily.<br /><br />- The information about nutrition is pretty skim, and partly inaccurate (I study nutrition), but WAY better than the protein-overdose nutrition program presented in most other strength training manuals.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is the best book on bodyweight training available. It's way more realistic than Pavel's absurd workout, yet challenging enough for anyone to get a complete workout, no matter what your background is.e to create your own training programs    - You can follow the training programs as laid out by the author, but they are challenging!     - There's lots of exercise beyond the typical pushups, many of which you've never heard of.     - You can do the exercises everywhere with almost all of the exercises.

Spirits just have no imagination and haven't for the past 100 years of film making.   (5.) Same old spirit searchers with attempts this time to be funny that were more juvenile that credible.  (6.) Same old analog EMF devices that for the past 20 years have actually been digital and measure nothing but electromagnetic fields that all electrical wiring and appliances put off. I have one and it's about as meaningful to spirt/demons as a toothbrush.   (7.) Same old twisty possessed person at the end.   (8.) Same old rental Halloween costume and CGI effects.   (9.) The only thing insidious in this movie was \\"the movie\\" and director's capacity to use an a dictionary to find a word that hasn't been used before. Such intelligence is humbling.
0007119550|2.0|I have just finished this fourth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, and will be reading no further. I am bored out of my skull, with what started out as a fabulously-engrossing story in Game of Thrones, but has now deteriorated into an endless series of 'cliffhanger' chapter endings and an endless parade of characters, created apparently only to be killed off or passed around, ad infinitum. I no longer give a rip who becomes 'king' or IF anybody ever becomes king, who survives, who doesn't, or who-marries-whom. This is going on too long.  Ho-bloody-hum.<br /><br />Is there any resolution to this saga in sight? Well, no, apparently not yet. I understand this author has written, what, 5 books, 6 books, and STILL his 'story' isn't anywhere near being finished? I do think Mr Martin is having us on here. As long as people keep buying these books, he'll keep on churning them out. Why kill the Golden Goose?<br /><br />What a waste of such a strong writing talent!<br /><br />A GOOD story -- any kind of story, short OR long, including fantasy sagas -- must have focus.  It needs a beginning, a middle, AND an end. The ending need not be happy, but all loose threads need to be tied together in some satisfactory and believable way at the conclusion. And there really DOES need to be a conclusion.<br /><br />Mr Martin should take a gander at Joe Abercrombie's First Law fantasy trilogy, to see how a multi-viewpoint, lengthy and complicated 'gritty' story SHOULD be constructed.  That story was one of the most original and engrossing tales I've ever read, with a very satisfactory conclusion indeed.  This one ...well, sadly, it's not.  Unfortunately, this 'saga' has turned into a soap opera.<br /><br />Soap operas are different from stories. No matter how original the setting (remember Dark Shadows?), soaps just diddle on and on and on from day to day, until somebody finally pulls the plug on them. Exciting events come and go, original characters have their moments of drama, leave the show, new characters appear, hang around, have THEIR dramas, then THEY leave, etc, etc. Characters continually swap partners till nobody can remember who started with whom, family members fall out with each other, make up, fall out again ...etc, etc... Sound familiar?<br /><br />There are obviously folks out there who enjoy this kind of never-ending saga, but I'm not one of them. If somebody comes to me and says 'Hey -- did you know George RR Martin actually FINISHED his Song of Ice and Fire saga?', I might pick it up again and read on. But until that day dawns, I'm through. Sorry.around, have THEIR dramas, then THEY leave, etc, etc. Characters continually swap partners till nobody can remember who started with whom, family members fall out with each other, make up, fall out again ...etc, etc...

B004EPYZP8|2.0|The story had potential but wasn't anything that, for the most part, hasn't been done before. Unfortunately it was so disjointed and poorly edited that it lacked continuity and flow. People and objects suddenly appear and disappear off camera with no reason. The flash backs seemed too flash-backy as if the director knew he had to fill some storyline holes. The rent-a-biker-group of stereotypic old codgers and the strange missing pistol prop and the off screen death of an investigator are a few examples of let's-just-stick'em into the story and see what happens mentality. The courtroom scenes also seemed very staged. The acting was too scripted and predictable as was the obvious things-aren't-what-they-seem plot twists. As far as writing it seemed as if the writer just tossed together bits and pieces of books and movies he had seen before and basically just rearranging the pieces.
B004FOA84A|3.0|Enjoyable game, but right when things are getting interesting and you think you're about to encounter more challenging and exciting puzzles, it's over! I feel a little cheated, the adventure games for iphone and ipad make this one look like something from addictinggames. Worth 99&cent;? If it was three times as long I'd say yes.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I don't read much fiction but am glad I selected this one.  The story takes place over two weeks in the life of a woman who wakes up each day having little if any memory of who she is.  Each morning her husband gently tells her what happened - 20 years earlier(!) she was hit by a car; the accident resulted in an unusual form of amnesia in which her memory disappears when she goes to sleep.  Unbeknownst to him, she is seeing a doctor who gives her a journal to write in each day so she will have some concrete record of it the next day.  The hope is that this will help her regain her memory to some degree.  As the story progresses she begins to remember things - or at least she thinks she does; but she can never be quite sure if she is truly recalling something that happened, or if it's a false memory that came about because of something she read.  To top it all off, she finds inconsistencies between what her husband tells her and what her doctor tells her, leading to the question of who can she trust?  Ultimately and perhaps inevitably the novel leads to a surprise ending - actually two surprises - that I didn't completely see coming.  By about day 10 in the journal I admit I was ready to get to the climax of the story, and at that point hearing about her waking up each day with little or no memory of herself or her life was getting to be a little old (although no more so for me than for her!!)- but all in all an excellent read.  I'm looking forward to more from this author.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|The Yes Album was and still is the best Yes album with Fragile and Close to the Edge very close behind. In relatively recent years, only The Ladder has lived up to the band's true potential. The new album is very good and any one with the sensibility to understand how lucky we are to have music any where near this good in these days of talentless, forgetable Lady Gaga or Katy Perry pop throwaways should rethink things. The fact that Iggy Pop (who actually has some merits vis-a-vis Lady Gaga) is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Yes has never been nominated is an unpardonable crime. Please......

B001E1GXPA|5.0|Now roughly 3 years old, Trivium's Shogun has withstood the test of time, and still remains one of my favorite metal albums of the last 5 years.  I picked up this album about the same time that I purchased Kamelot's The Black Halo and Symphony X's Paradise Lost, and to me, these 3 albums are still my unholy trinity.  I usually cannot listen to one without listening to the others soon afterwards.  Though the styles are different, each is powerful in its own right.  My previous experience with Trivium was with the albums The Ascendancy and Crusade, and while technically proficient, they just didn't grab and violently shake me like I expected.  But it only took a few minutes of listening to \\"Kirisute Gomen\\" on Shogun to make me rethink my opinion of this amazing band.  Matt & Co. have truly created something genuine and breathtaking, and ultimately timeless.  And that is an amazing feat for any band.<br /><br />With the imminent release of the new album In Waves, I have been playing Shogun more and more often, and it seems to get better and better with each listen.  Why?  I honestly can't answer that question with words.  Suffice it to say that there's really not a weak track on the album.  Not a single one.  While not every song knocks it out of the park, there isn't a filler track or lackluster entry, and that is not something that happens too often on metal CD's.  But it's more than that.  Somehow, this album generates actual emotion, and ebbs and flows like a living thing.  When I first bought it, I tended to gravitate to my favorite songs, and ignore the others.  But recently, I have been playing it from start to finish, and because of that, it has evolved into an experience, not just a CD.  But I digress...<br /><br />So, for you few uninitiated, here are the tracks to pay attention to;  \\"Kirisute Gomen\\", the perfect choice as the intro track, teasing the ears with a slow & quiet start before the punishing drums kick in; \\"Down From the Sky\\", the single, released with an official video, and a pretty awesome metal song; \\"Throes of Perdition\\", my personal favorite from the album, with great lyrics, a sing-a-long chorus, and a brutal breakdown in the middle; \\"Insurrection\\", a blistering track with staccato drums and Slayer-esque soloing; \\"The Calamity\\", a more melodic track with a great solo; \\"Of Prometheus and the Crucifix\\", another song with a catchy chorus and great solo; \\"Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven\\", my other personal favorite, with driving guitars and drums and raspy vocals; and \\"Shogun\\" the 11+ minute title track, a slow burner for about 8 minutes before kicking into high gear for nearly the remainder of the song.<br /><br />I always recommend picking up the special edition of albums if they have bonus tracks, and Shogun is no different.  There are 3 bonus tracks to be had.  Of the 3, \\"Upon the Shores\\" and \\"Iron Maiden\\" are the standouts, and evoke a sense of Ride The Lightning and Kill `Em All era Metallica.  I know that's what Trivium is going for, and it works well.<br /><br />I am hoping that In Waves continues the strong trend that Shogun has established.  If not, I still have this great album that keeps getting better with every listen.  If you haven't heard it yet, take a listen to \\"Kirisute Gomen\\" and see if it doesn't blow you away.  If it does, then this album is for you!l video, and a pretty awesome metal song; \\"Throes of Perdition\\", my personal favorite from the album, with great lyrics, a sing-a-long chorus, and a brutal breakdown in the middle; \\"Insurrection\\", a blistering track with staccato drums and Slayer-esque soloing; \\"The Calamity\\", a more melodic track with a great solo; \\"Of Prometheus and the Crucifix\\", another song with a catchy chorus and great solo; \\"Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven\\", my other personal favorite, with driving guitars and drums and raspy vocals; and \\"Shogun\\" the 11+ minute title track, a slow burner for about 8 minutes before kicking into high gear for nearly the remainder of the song.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book bothered me very much.  Actually it made me sick to my stomach knowing what that poor child lived through.  I'm glad I bought the book because she deserves the support from it...my wish for her is that she sells a billion books and her and her daughters, mother and sister live in the lap of luxury and happiness for the rest of thier lives.  She deserves nothing less and even that will never make up for what this young woman lived through.
B004WKOCP8|1.0|HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Most simply put.....There are albums that make you want to get into your car and just drive really fast(The new Foo Fighters-Wasting Light!) This new Incubus album makes you want to get in your car and drive really fast into a tree! And I don't want to hear anyone else say that they are changing or evolving. EVERY single one of their albums have had great kick ass music and did not venture into the abyss of soft contemporary music like this does!! There is no Anna Molly, no Rogues or Pendulous Threads on this album. Nothing even compares to Nice to Know You or Drive! Every song is forgettable! Incredible talent wasted!    Now I'm sure all the female fans vaginas are going to swell enormously when listening to this album because it's all Brandon's vocals and nothing else. The rest of the band is still on vacation I guess. Less talented studio musicians could play the simplistic background music on these songs. There are no cool guitar riffs, no heart pounding drum beats or any cool rhythms of any kind.  I'm fine with a band trying different types of music or growing or whatever you want to label it, but at least make GOOD music!! This new album is lifeless, stale, monotonously boring and void of any energy at all!!     They used to be a great alternative rock band. Now they are just turning into another adult contemporary band who's music will be heard in an elevator or a waiting room. Maybe they can even tour with Celine Dion or Enrique Iglesias. Is that the Incubus you want to see?     Do me a favor. Go buy Incubus Alive at Red Rocks (the dvd) and watch Vitamin and then put their new album on and start listening to it. Then ask yourself.....\\"If not now, when?\\"
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I bought a new Yowza treadmill, which has an ipod dock and built-in speakers. I asked the company if the treadmill supported non-Apple devices, and they seemed confused by the question. Too many people think Apple is the only company around. Oh well. I bought the treadmill for running; the ipod dock is a bonus. But I didn't want to waste that resource. I looked at another adapter here on Amazon, but it was more expensive and had negative reviews. The CableJive sounded pretty good and was about $5 less expensive.<br /><br />I just got the treadmill last night and tried the CableJive this morning. It works flawlessly with the treadmill and now I can listen to my Sansa Fuze over the treadmill's speakers. My husband has an ipod that he received for Christmas, so if he wants to use the treadmill and listen to his stuff, the ipod dock is still there and not compromised in any way. I think it's the best of both worlds, and if I want to buy something else that's geared for ipods, I can simply moved the CableJive to where it's needed.
B0038W0OHQ|5.0|Over the past 5 years I have been buying headphones only to have them become very uncomfortable over extended periods of use. Usually headphones will hurt the outside of my ears, pressing against and hurting. But these headphones are so comfortable that when I wore them for over 8 hours, I forgot I was even wearing them. In addition to the comfort, the sound and the quality of the item is top notch and I would recommend these to anyone trying to find a pair of comfortable, quality headphones.
B00079ZACM|5.0|This is the truest version of \\"Four Feathers\\" available.The recent Heath Ledger-Djimon Honsu version suffers from Politcal Correctness and has wooden performances-esp.Cate Hudson.This original version was done during Hollywood's British Period of such films as \\"Gunga Din\\",and \\"Lives of a Bengal Lancer\\".Wonderful atmospheric production values and solid performances by all.
1933633867|5.0|Graeber's accessible and clear writing style easily makes you forget how complex and all-encompassing this book is. Thoroughly cited and cleverly constructed, Debt takes you from the nascent conceptualization of debt to the institutionally upheld system it exists as today. Fascinating book, which I fear may be correct in its findings.

0553801473|2.0|When and if a new book in this series comes out, I'll wait for it to be available at the library, if I even bother. This book covered so many characters, most of whom I did not remember or care about. It is a continuation of book 3 and runs in parallel to book 4. Book 3 came out eleven years ago, which is too long for me to remember. This book does not wrap anything up and Martin has an annoying habit of killing the few major characters we actually care about.
B004EPZ084|3.0|My feeling after seeing this movie was that it is silly, adolescent, vulger & crude, but that it is pushed (just barely) up into the level of 3 stars by its all-star cast (Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston, Colin Ferrell and Jason Bateman).   Of course, many people can relate to having bad bosses, and fleeting thoughts of knocking them off sometime.  So our modern three stooges (three 30-something middle-class guys) each have a bad boss: Spacey is the arrogant bastard boss, Ferrell is the selfish druggie boss, and Aniston is the overly sexual female boss.  Each is over-the-top unrealistic.  Actually the whole movie feels over-the-top (I guess that Hollywood thinks they have to do everything that way -- like hitting you in the face with a mallet.)  But Spacey does play a very effective flaming jerk, ultra-arrogant, rich guy, and Ferrell a flaming jerk, coke-head, and Aniston a flaming jerk nympho dentist.    The guys decide to knock off each other's boss and things get out of control.  Really, the plot is just a vehicle to run a number of gags & jokes.  Like breaking into the druggy's house & spilling his cocaine all over the place & sweeping it up with a dust-buster.  Like hiring a \\"hit man\\" from \\"men seeking men\\" in the local paper and learning that he's got other things on his mind.  Like going to a black bar in a seedy part of town and hiring a scary-looking ex-con named \\"M********r Jones\\", and our silly, wimpy stooges calling him by his name all the time.  Like getting an Indian guy on the GPS help line in the car, named \\"Gregory\\" because his real name is unpronounceable (Gregory plays a big role at the end though).    Everything is exceedingly stupid, but it hits the funnybone about half the time.  The three stooges have pretty good comedic chemistry.  Aniston does add a lot of stimulation by showing off her (pretty darn sexy)  body in different stages of undress in a psycho-nympho role .... that old adolescent Hollywood trick works all the time I guess.  Then there's the old \\"who would get raped worse in jail?\\" supposedly humorous discussion ... there's nothing better for yucking things up than prison rape jokes!  Then there's the old \\"we are three white goofy buffoons talking to a cool black guy who calls us morons and rips us off\\" situation.  i.e. self-abasement by the immature and non-streetwise white men is supposed to be hilarious (or maybe it's just a Hollywood requirement if there are blacks & whites together in a movie.)  But the abasement goes both ways, due to the first name of the black ex-con, which has to be the most despicable word in the English language.      So there's a lot of low-class humor in this movie.  Actually, I get pretty tired of the F-word interjected into half of the lines in the movie by its end.  Don't the writers, who are supposedly the best in the country and very well paid, have any more literary talent than to say \\"F-this, F-that, F-ing F\\" all the time in order to get laughs?   Well, OK, that's what to expect from a modern R-rated comedy.
B004WPT3ZM|2.0|This is a phenominal package for Megadeth fans and newcommers alike. Excellent liner notes and the amount of material you get for the price is great. But in terms of the remastering quality, it isn't worth it in my opinion. The fact that it is the original mix is great because now you can hear the way the album was intended to be, but if you have the original CD pressing from 1986, stick with that copy. It seems these days record labels are only interested in making remasters and releases louder, instead of putting care and quality into them. Like I always say, heavy metal is great when played loud, but that's why we have volume knobs. If the CD is already too loud, then it clips and distorts in places where it shouldn't be and just sounds compressed and wimpy. Whereas the original sounds great at any volume, especially if you crank it up.
B004Q84Z0S|5.0|Ariodante is the one of Handel's \\"great\\" operas I've always had the most trouble with. I found both Minkowski's and McGegan's recordings curiously unsatisfying, even with such great singers as Anne-Sofie von Otter and Lorraine Hunt in the title role. This recording is different. Alan Curtis apparently decided \\"no more mr. Nice Guy\\", and went for broke in this recording. It's an exceedingly dramatic and forceful performance, aided and abetted by his star, Joyce DiDonato. Even the recitatives sparkle with drama. There are still problems, but they are mostly of Handel's making, not mr. Curtis. The first act has always seemed disappointing to me, with a lot of downright awkward music. There's the great aria \\"Con L'ali Di Constanza\\" of course, but it's always struck me that Ariodante follows closer to the pattern of many second-tier Handel operas, where the first act is not quite on the level of the second and third acts, than the other great masterpieces such as Guilio Cesare, Rinaldo or Orlando which are on a uniformly high level of inspiration.<br /><br />No matter, Curtis leads a wonderful performance, and when Handel's greatest operatic aria, \\"Scherza Infida\\" rolls around, Joyce DiDonato gives an absolutely electrifying rendition of this masterpiece. Better even than her recent CD of Handel arias, and better than the live performance I saw her give at Zankel Hall a couple of years ago. Everyone else is excellent, the orchestral playing is top-notch. Very satisfying, at last.
0783225725|5.0|The first time I saw High Plains Drifter was probably in the late 1970s. Clint Eastwood stars in and directs the film. Most westerns are either about cattle drives or cowboys and Indians. High Plains Drifter is different: this is a God's-Judgment-on-the-wicked western.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays a stranger who rides into the town of Lago--and he has a really bad attitude. This stranger is also very good with a side arm. During the course of the film, the stranger ends up killing some bad guys and burning the town of Lago to the ground. There are a couple of flashbacks of one Marshall Jim Duncan being whipped to death. At the end of the film, the audience can see that the stranger was the Second Coming of Marshall Duncan:<br /><br />The stranger rides out of the town of Lago past the cemetary. This little guy named Mordecai is writing something on a grave marker. The stranger looks at Mordecai and Mordecai looks up and says, \\"I'm just about finished here.\\"<br /><br />Then Mordecai asks the stranger, \\"By the way, I never did know your name.\\"<br /><br />And the stranger replies, \\"Oh yes, you do.\\"<br /><br />As the stranger rides off, the camera shows the grave marker: \\"Marshall Jim Duncan.\\"<br /><br />I have a short story entitled \\"High Plains Drifter\\" (Ethos, March & May 1995); I have a book entitled High Plains Drifter: A Hitchhiking Journey Across America (PublishAmerica, December 2008); I have a blog called \\"High Plains Drifter.\\" So is this some sort of gunslinger fixation or is there method to my madness? The clue is in one Scripture: \\"In the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established.\\"<br /><br />There is a lot of sin (unrepented sin) in the United States and in the world. When people continue to live in sin, eventually God's Judgment falls. The more people try to hide their sin, the greater God's Judgment. The people of Lago tried to hide the murder of Marshall Duncan, but their sin was found out. You can't hide from God.<br /><br />There is a scene in High Plains Drifter where this lady tells the stranger, \\"Ever since Marshall Duncan's death, the people in this town are afraid of strangers.\\"<br /><br />*****<br /><br />\\"When the Stranger says: 'What is the meaning of this city?<br />Do you huddle close together because you love each other?'<br />What will you answer? 'We all dwell together<br />To make money from each other'? or 'This is a community'?<br /><br />\\"Oh my soul, be prepared for the coming of the Stranger.<br />Be prepared for him who knows how to ask questions.<br /><br />\\"There is one who remembers the way to your door:<br />Life you may evade, but Death you shall not.<br />You shall not deny the Stranger.\\"<br /><br />--T.S. Eliot<br />Choruses from \\"The Rock\\"<br /><br />*****<br /><br />There is another scene in High Plains Drifter where the people of Lago are meeting at the church. One of the guys is speaking in the front of the church. The camera then pans to the right and shows a bulletin board with this Scripture: Isaiah 53: 3-4: \\"Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.\\"<br /><br />Marshall Jim Duncan was whipped to death; Jesus Christ was at least nine-tenths whipped to death. The stranger riding into Lago (the first scene of the film) is a symbol of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ: not as the Lamb of God, but as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah.<br /><br />Isaiah 63: 1-6: \\"Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat? I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for Iwill tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.\\"<br /><br />[...]will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.

B001I0T92Q|4.0|I bought this product because not only was it cheap, but it seemed like the perfect solution for my PSP.    This review is how this product performs in a PSP-1000 system (generation 1, original motherboard). I've been stuck with a 4gb card since I bought this PSP at launch. I love it. 4gb served my purpose well. But recently there have been some titles and games that I've wanted and I don't regularly change what games and songs and movies I have on my PSP. In fact I hate syncing so I try to avoid it at all costs.    Anyways, that's where I found this beauty. This thing is fantastic. I have a 4gb class 6 microSD card, and an 8gb class 2 card. Those are my 2 highest MicroSD cards I own. Therefore I was interested in trying to couple their capacities. And this adapter did not disappoint.    I only gave it 4 stars however due to a small but diminishing con. That is; if your PSP is hacked for a custom firmware, you MUST use this card as a MMS (users will know what this means and I won't go into great detail about it). The other facet is; you MUST use this card inside the PSP from the start, meaning formatting and everything. When you open the package and put in your MicroSD cards into the adapter, you must first and foremost format your memory card as the PSP can't read it. Standard with any raidcard if you have experience with that.    But this adapter is so much greater than a raidcard. Yes it functions in the same method, meaning if you remove a card or swap the slots, it becomes inert and requires a reformat. Essentially making it a raid 0. But here's the kicker. YOU GET TO USE ALL YOUR STORAGE. That's right. My 4gb and 8gb sticks combined for a total of 12gb and 11gb usage space due to overhead. This was better than I expected as a standard raid operates by taking the lowest single drive of space and only uses that much per drive. So if you had a 2tb drive in a raid with a 1tb drive, you could only use 1tb of the 2tb drive in the raid. Making it 2tb raid instead ofthe presumed 3tb. But not with this card, it simply adds. And that is what I had hoped for.    I will be getting 2 16gb cards in the next couple months but for now this will suffice.    As for speed, it's pretty standard. upwards of 6mb/s real world transfer speed of 8gb of data at once from computer through USB to the PSP.    All in all, it's a damn good product, but like anything it could be better.    tl;dr    Pro  +Adds storage for very cheap  +Adds storage devices together instead of lowest common denominator  +Not particularly fragile as others mentioned  +No noticeable difference when up and running how you want it  +CHEAP! (the good kind)    Con  -Must be a MMS for homebrew PSP's  -MUST be formatted and used inside the PSP/other devices    Other thoughts  =Not a pro or con, the documentation is a little lacking but it's a freaking adapter card so what can you expect.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|As always with Incubus, they have managed to produce an album unlike any they have produced before. If you go into this experience with an open mind, and with the knowledge that Incubus will never do what you want, or what you expect then I think you will fully enjoy this record as much as I do.
B000ASATYO|5.0|I have always loved this movie and this time was no exception. Having the director cut gave me just that much more of a story that I enjoy watching over and over. I never tire of it. And the service thru Amazon was quick and easy.
0345529057|4.0|Excellent read. Martin has a wondrous way of creating believable characters. Easy to get attached to his style. Good stuff....although there are lulls. My only criticism is that it's a bit too long. Even chopping a 1,000 page epic down to 750 pages might be a good thing. But he's the best seller, so who am I to say...
1451629184|4.0|I bought and read the whole book in one night on the same day...!   My miserable childhood experience is like a walk in the park compared to hers... and I should not be bitter about it.   If she could endure it and be able to move on, happily, then so can I!       Her book, altho so traumatic and sad, was quite riveting with her accounts of bravery and coping with the isolation the best as she could, from her 5-th grade point of view...!          However, I found it so galling and unbelievable that after Jaycee told the sexual predator's wife at the meeting, during the trial, how she felt and her thoughts, that wife simply said, \\"...I still love him.\\"  She must be so out of her mind to love somebody like him?!?!!       It is so unbelievable that the officers did not even catch anything amiss and how they got away with it for YEARS!!!   It is so miraculous that the two girls were born healthy and without any problems with lack of medical care!!  The angels were certainly watching over her!         I truly recommend this book, especially those who have had traumatic experience, big or small, that anyone can learn to move on, without looking or dwelling at the past!
B002OT731E|5.0|I really don't know why some people threw away this cd. It is great, surely not perfect (but the Stones were never \\"perfect\\"), but really full of life. Some songs like \\"Dead Flowers\\" or \\"Let it Bleed\\" are sure way better than the original version and there's much to listen. The bluesy and country licks in their music are very much in evidence, here. Buy it without doubts.
B004EPYZZI|4.0|I admit that I am not normally one who likes to have faith mixed in with my movie.  I normally find myself more interested in the fantastical worlds such as Mirrormask, the amazing adventures of Doctor Who, the mindless bloodshed of Resident Evil, or the quirky humor of Shawn of the Dead than an inspirational film such as this.  But every once in awhile I find a little gem that is just too good to not watch, and this movie most definitely fits the bill.      Some people have issue with the faith based overtones.  I've though about it for awhile and decided that this is my answer to those issues:  It doesn't matter if a film has a Christian overtone, Buddhist overtone, no overtone, somewhat of a maybe overtone or whatever.  A good movie is a good movie, and this film is definitely a good movie.  From what I've seen in interviews and the like, Bethany and her family are deeply religious people whose faith helped them deal with this.  I would say that if there WASN'T an overtone it would do the story a disservice.      So why the 4 stars?  This is a slight bit of overacting at parts in my opinion, plus, while I find this an excellent film I do not put it with my favorite all time films ever.  I would give it a 4.5 but that is not an option.
B004WKOCP8|4.0|Incubus, undoubtedly is my favorite band, and I'd say 80% of the time I'm listening to music, it's theirs.  I first heard about them in 2001 when \\"Drive\\" and \\"Morning View\\" came out because my sister was in love with their music and would ceaselessly play it.         I didn't hate nor favor their music, but it wasn't until 2008 that I really started liking the band.  I found myself liking every song of theirs immediately.  S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was a bit bizarre to me initially since I wasn't used to the style (I was used to Morning View and Make Yourself), but with one listen I was hooked.  I don't mind whatsoever if Incubus changes, that's good.  Never in a million years will I expect a \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\" album from them, I loved all their styles from Fungus to Light Grenades and appreciated all of them.       With \\"If Not Now, When?\\", when I try to get into the songs of this album, it feels forced.  I know the album is a lot softer and I expected that ever since I heard Mike Einziger's insight on the album, but the songs just sound so mediocre.  Incubus can create music far more brilliant than on this album.  The soft sound is not the problem, they've been making soft music for 12 or so years and that hasn't been an issue to me.  Some of their best music has been the softer tracks (Drive, I Miss You, Mexico, Southern Girl, 11 AM, Just A Phase, Dig, Love Hurts, Are You In?, Talk Shows on Mute, the list continues), but they just had so much emotion, so much passion into them.  On here, most of them feel haphazard and seem to just move out into nowhere.        This band has so much potential, talent, and skill, but this album shows otherwise and demonstrates that they're not living up to it.  It's like watching your child work at McDonald's when he/she has the credentials and intelligence to go to medical school.  Brandon's vocals as always are spot on, very beautiful and heavenly.  As for the others of the band, it's very lacking and neglected.  Einziger's guitar playing isabsent in many parts of the songs and doesn't contribute as much as before on previous albums, Pasillas' drumming is too laidback and rather a bore on the majority of tracks, playing really slow and forgettable drum beats.  There's little to no contributions from Kilmore with his samplings/mixings and weird but tasteful sounds that really added flavor to songs in the past.  I know the turntable days are long gone with the band, it's a pity because as I said earlier, it truly added spice to their music.  As for Kenney's bass playing, like Einziger, I can hardly ever hear any bass in the songs.  The instruments seem too neglected on this album and are focused merely on Brandon's vocals complimented by some slow and stale drum beat by Pasillas.  The only songs that didn't really feel forced to get into were \\"Thieves\\", the first two singles, and \\"The Original\\".  Here's a breakdown of all the songs:  1.  If Not Now, When? 5/10.  Probably the worst track on the album and a horrible way to start it off.  Feels extremely tedious and found myself waiting for this track to be over just to get to the next one.  2.  Promises, Promises 8/10.  In spite of the backlash this single has received, I rather like it.  Brandon's lyrics and storytelling are done very well.  3.  Friends And Lovers 6/10.  A mediocre track.  I try getting interested in it but catch myself skipping this one.  4.  Thieves. 10/10  By far the best track (in my opinion) on the album.  The figurative language is outstanding and the chorus is extremely catchy, It's always in my head and I'll be singing it in my head periodically throughout the day.  5.  Isadore.  9/10.  One of the better tracks.  Good acoustic song.  Not really that much else to say about it.  6.  The Original.  10/10.  Another top song of the album.  The beginning has this odd, yet intriguing part and while a slow song, it's nevertheless a proficient one.  7.  Defiance.  8/10.  An acoustic track that resembles the sound of older Incubus songs.It has a \\"Incubusy\\" feel to it.  Too short of a song however.  8.  In The Company of Wolves 7/10.  The longest song on the album.  The songs changes as it goes on.  It's not a bad song, but it feels dragged out, empty and contains filler.  As with the first track, you just want the song to be over and move on to the next.  9.  Switchblade.  8/10.  One of the more energetic songs on the album, the vocals don't seems as concentrated upon as the others.  An adequate track.  10.  Adolescents.  10/10  The most reminiscent of all previous Incubus sounds.  Though the lyrics are sort of repetitive, and the oriental part is tedious, the solo is nice and the song in general is up there with the top tracks.  11.  Tomorrow's Food.  9/10.  Another one of my favorite songs and good way to end the album.  I loved it the first time I heard it when it made it's premiere at Oxford when it was just Mike and Brandon playing the track.  It would have received a perfect score had it not been for the end.  The last 2 minutes or so are empty of singing and the instruments add a modicum to maintain your interest, it feels blank towards the end.         Overall, I give the album a 3.5.  I know I'm being biased as Incubus is absolutely my favorite band and I listen to their music all the time, but when you bear in mind the 5 year break, Incubus has a lot more to bring to the table than this.  You have to eliminate from your mind that this is the same band that brought you \\"Morning View\\" and \\"A Crow Left of the Murder\\".  This effort is something that they can and should transcend in their next effort.  Hopefully the criticisms of this album gives the band something to reconsider and reevaluate once the next album rolls around.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is my favorite version of Angry Birds.  I especially like the new characters &amp; even boss battles now!  It's quite a bit easier than Angry Birds Seasons, so that may irritate some, but I liked that aspect of it.
0553582038|4.0|I read this book in 2 parts for 2 reasons.  I wanted to finish it closer to when ADWD came out and because it was so slow for the first half of the book.    My biggest problem with the book was the Brienne chapters in the first half of the book seemed to accomplish nothing.  All I remember from them is trees.    The second half of the book makes up for it though and really made the read well worth it.  If I was to suggest this book to someone I would recommend reading the Brienne chapter summarys from the first half of the book on [...].
B001EN71CW|5.0|I stumbled upon episode 1 while poking around hulu.com, was very intrigued.  What really caught my eye in the beginning was the space ship, Serenity, a \\"firefly-class vessel\\".  The ship layout and design really spoke to me as an engineer, but the story lines, characters and plots were just as intriguing, mixing a \\"wild-west\\" theme with deep space expansion.  The parallels aren't too far off the mark.  Too bad this series was ahead of it's time and was cancelled after 11 episodes, would have liked to see the rest of Season 1 and many more!  At least things are largely wrapped up in the movie Serenity, that's another must-have.
B003UESJEM|5.0|If you have lost your job, or know someone who has this movie is YOUR STORY   A good double feature with this movie is Up In The Air.  Great acting, wonderful cast..It really hits a nerve. Not out in the theaters long for that very reason.  Too close to home for many.
0399250573|5.0|This book was awesome! It says FINAL MISSION in big print on the cver but could that mean another book with no missio I wonder? The ending leaves you hanging! But it is great!
B004LWZW24|2.0|I'll probably get rated badly for this review. But before you give me that bad rating, please read the rest of my review.<br /><br />I went into this movie with sky high expectations. I know it isn't fair, but I kept hearing from people that the movie was terrifying. People couldn't sleep after, people were getting sick to their stomach, and others were saying it was the best movie to come out in years.<br /><br />The movie started off pretty decently, some of the acting was a little off, but I was willing to overlook it for the ghost aspect. The movie quickly goes downhill sadly. One ghost dances around looking like a Leprechaun, and it was hilarious. The \\"demon\\" looks like Darth Maul on crack, and the other spirits just are not scary. On top of this it was very predictable when and where the ghosts would show up. To have a good ghost movie you can't do that.<br /><br />Once the movie is explained to really mainly be about astral projection, demons and other dimensions I got really bummed out. But I was hoping the movie could be saved. Sadly it couldn't. It got a LOT worse from there on out. The movie was just completely silly, especially when the old lady puts on a gas mask to communicate with the child...<br /><br />For a more in depth review on this movie and other horror movies and horror books visit my profile for a link to my website.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|I don't know  - was it part of the author's clever plan to have the reader feel the same frustrations as Chrissie, by repeatedly recovering the same ground over and over and over again? I really wanted to skip ahead because the story itself was so repetitive. Honestly, you could explain the plot pretty thoroughly in about 30 words or less.     It felt like the author started with a good idea (albeit one which borrowed heavily from the movie \\"Memento\\" ), planted the mystery in our minds and then was committed to fill a certain number of pages (reiterating the premise at regular intervals), until  she had reached a predetermined word count.  Finally, in the last few pages there was a mad rush of story,  with key characters suddenly spilling revelations to neatly tie up all the loose ends.    The premise was a good one, but I felt like this was really a short story, contrived to be a novel. Lots of tension, but not much plot..  When I learned that the book was the end result of a novel writing course the author attended, it kind of made sense.    An okay first book, but the reviewer hype sets expectations too high, I thought.
B00338QENI|5.0|Fascinating, gripping, well written; shocking, and amazing story.  To think that I personally have benefitted from Henrietta Lacks through all the medical discoveries resulting from HeLa gives me goosebumps filled with gratitude.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|I'm guessing that it will just take me a little time to fall in love with this cd but currently I'm just in a \\"like\\" relationship with it. I typically don't skip any songs on her cd's but this one did get me to hit the button!
140053271X|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Amazon.com. In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!    Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.    The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile \\"buttons\\" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.     Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!    This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!    Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.  Once again, I looked to Amazon.com first, but there simply were not good options.  I got a black leather Caseen case that also came with a screen protector for twenty bucks.
B002SM2QDC|5.0|Good graphics and plot.  I have to admit I was cheering for the bad guys on this one but what can I say, I'm an Eccleston fan.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|With the new Evagelion created using CGI animated graphics to create both cell style and 3D style animation the appeal is clear that this set to be four part set will be one to remember with stunning visuals that bring to light all the history and vitality we fans have come to want and expect from the series without simply re-watching a remaster. A pure reinvention and it shows with the introduction of new cast and the unexpected loss of others.     I found it worth owning because I own the whole original and while I love every moment of the first it can be slow at times and award. The first two movies left me feeling very uneasy and a bit disturbed in points where as these remind me of the golden days of the show bringing to life that great part that made the show work.     Action, drama, excitement, emotion, a boy trying to find his way in the world despite all the difficulties he's been thrown. Political upheaval and fear of utter annihilation at any moment from the angels.

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I purchased this lav mic because I read good reviews about it on camcorder forums. It performs very well considering it's one of the most inexpensive lav mics you can buy.    Unfortunately, my first chance to use it was at a wedding. I needed to feed the mic into a digital voice recorder in the pocket of the groom and felt the 20' mic cable was just to long to coil up in his pocket. Fortunately, Radio Shack carries a similar model with a 6'cord that worked out very well.    There are times, however, that the 20' cord will come in handy allowing me to get some distance between the camera and the person talking. There is a saying that goes, \\"When you're able run a cable.\\" This mic works better than some wireless systems and there is less chance of getting interference - although you still can because it has an unshielded cable (other reasons as well).    A consider this a good mic for the price.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|I haven't seen Bradley Cooper in too many movies but he's not a bad actor. He's believable. Anyhow, I saw this movie in the theaters and was simply impressed because I guess I didn't have high hopes for this movie. Now I'm reading the original book and it's really good. Very original, good subject, but the writing in the book isn't great. Either way, the movie gets 4 stars for keeping me quite entertained and impressed at the end of the theatrical release. The book so far gets 3.5 stars even though I'm half way through it... the writing just isn't good...
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I encourage everyone to read the comments to the top rated review by Thomas Cannold where you will find plenty of evidence that this product is a copied bootleg. In addition to what you read there (shoddy packaging, size of DVDs are only 4.5 GB and not the standard 7 GB), I can confirm there are plenty of spelling errors on the disks with the episode titles. For example, Season 1 Disk 3 reads \\"Hide And O\\" (instead of \\"Hide And Q\\") and \\"The Big Boodbyb\\".    Obvious pirated software. Do not buy.
B004IQMXD4|1.0|I really don't understand all the rave reviews for this album. I have all the Stevie Nicks albums and love her music, but this is a very dull and uninspired offering from her. If she didn't have the reputation she has, I doubt whether people would really bother with this.  Hey Ho !! Dull and lacklustre.  Gone is the spark of 'Belladonna' and the beauty of 'Wild Heart' and 'The Other Side of the Mirror'. There is nothing memorable to me about this album. I'm very dissappointed with it !!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|The Bee Gees do not disappoint.  Their music is timeless, lively.  Their harmony unmatched.  You can't help but sing along.
B000QJM8Z0|5.0|I actually read this book more than 10 years ago, and I still think this is one of the most enjoyable chick lits so far.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I'm going to keep this short, and relatively spoiler-free.    After the first two books, which I devoured in a day each, I could barely finish Mockingjay. I spent most of the book wanting to smack Katnis, who was completely out of character with how she was in the first two books. Where did strong, defiant Katnis go? Why did we have to deal with her having a mental breakdown every thirty pages?     This book just felt wooden, lacking in the brilliance that made the first two such favorites of mine. It really did feel more like a bad fanfiction version of the third book in the series compared to what I was expecting from this author.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|My mom bought this product for the whole family to use and I'm obsessed. I can take it anywhere and its super easy to carry and not too heavy. I can watch movies on it when the family room is taken, and I plan to take it on road trips as well. It's the perfect portable system for anyone who enjoys fun on the road, from video games to movies. I'm taking it to college with me this fall and i'm excited to use it all the time!!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is blunt to the point. What Jaycee and her girls endured is pure evil.  I had to set it down a time or two and catch my breath.  This book though should be a teaching tool of survival.  Jaycee has survived and shows letting go is what keeps the evil from taking control.  Well written...finally a happy ever after.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is AMAZING! I can read it over and over again and never get tired of it. I love the dialogue between the characters and I love the characters themselves. Travis and Abby have such great chemistry together. Travis is a sweetheart too. Now, would I date him? Hell no! I don't have the patience nor inclination for a relationship like that. Travis would've scared the crap out of me with his erratic and violent behavior especially when he's jealous. However, I still enjoyed reading about the couple despite the fact that I would never date someone like Travis. I'm surprised Abby was able to put up with Travis and his mess. There were many times I would've given up or not spoken to Travis for days. I was definitely rooting for Travis and Abby to be able to work through their problems though and emerge as a stronger couple. And they did. Although it's still kind of dysfunctional.<br /><br />It should be noted that there are grammatical errors. Words are capitalized when they shouldn't be; the margins are strange and awkward; the dialogue isn't correct either; etc. An editor needs to go through the book and fix these obvious mistakes.<br /><br />I could gush about this book for hours but I won't. Just know that it is a fantastic book with lovable characters. The heroine isn't annoying either which I personally loved as all I've been able to find lately are heroines that let me down. All in all, check out this book. It's definitely worth it.
B004XZ99LO|2.0|We have seen many Cirque shows & this one was not nearly as interesting as the live shows.  The 3D effects weren't very good either.
B003ZWTGKU|5.0|This is a beautiful production sung and acted out by a fantastic cast.<br />Unfortunately the film director was an idiot and marred an otherwise 10-star performance.  As it is, still 5 stars.<br />Not only did Jonas Kaufmann gave a terrific performance in the title role; the sisters Charlotte and Sophie are both vocally very beautiful, the Sophie especially outstanding, and the husband Albert wonderfully portrayed by the great French baritone Ludovic Tezier, a grossly underrated singer.<br />Kaufmann's Werther is not a light-voiced one, but he is so moving that makes you wonder why hitherto only lyrical tenors were casted in this role?<br />The stage setting is romantic and beautiful. To downgrade such performance by side issues is really putting the cart before the horse, and misses the critical issues horribly.

1400052181|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend. I have a chemistry background, so I wasn't sure I would enjoy a \\"biology\\" book.  But the story of the Lacks family is fascinating; following the determination of Henrietta's daughter Deborah to learn the truth about her mother, even while risking her own health. This book is exhaustively researched and fact-checked. And I did learn a lot about the development of cell culturing, which was interesting too, even to a chemist. I read this right after \\"The Help\\" and give both 5 stars.
1451629184|4.0|I must admit, I almost put the book down a couple chapters in due to the detail of the horribly graphic things that happened to her, but it happened and putting the book down doesn't make that go away. I ended up reading it in less than 1 day. Its and \\"easy\\" read in that you can't put it down, but it is not always easy to feel what she was feeling or to have to imagine the disgusting, misery she endured. I often felt like I was reading the actual thoughts of an 11 year old because there are many short sentences and simple writing, but I think that's what makes you relate to it even more, you feel so strongly for this stolen child. This was a child who was never allowed to grow up the way a child should. Jaycee is an amazing person and a survivor, you feel for her, her daughters, and I cried for most parts dealing with her mother. Though frustrating, she does make you understand why she stayed for so long. She was broken down for so long, she didn't know how to make decisions of her own.    I do feel this should be used as a tool for children today. Perhaps they shouldn't read the whole thing, it would be very traumatizing, but I think parents, teachers, etc should not only teach about \\"stranger danger\\" but they should teach what happens if you are successfully abducted and the mind control that will be used and that your mother will always want you back and look for you no matter what. And though they may feel no one wants them anymore, this couldn't be further from the truth, a mother (or father) will never forget you and if you can escape if not for yourself, do it for all the people who love you. There is a nothing a child can do that would ever make a parent not want them anymore. There is nothing that makes taking a child from their life and family ok and no one will ever love you more than your own family does.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is Jaycee's story. There are readily enough details to portray the atrocities, yet other stories that tell the tale of a young girl's unusual life. Yes, there is time spent detailing her daughters and pets.  That was her life. She found strength and sanity in these things. She is a strong woman with a positive nature and living proof that the human spirit is not easily broken.  This is Jaycee's story.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I bought this watch for my wife. I've used a 205 for several years but she didn't like it because of the size. The set up takes some time and you better plan on reading the manual to use the watch. I also had to switch the band to the nylon hook and loop. Fortunately it was included so it wasn't a big deal. My wife isn't a runner but she does like to track the time, distance and speed of her walks. Since she likes to walk park trails a regular watch and pre-driving the route to get distance isn't an option. She is happy with the gps watch. I know this because she uses it and she hasn't complained about any dislikes other than the reading the manual and getting use to how it worked at the beginning.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I did not know I needed a Kindle until I tried this app. If you are on the fence about buying a full device I recommend trying it out with the free app. Works well, easy to read and buy books right from your phone. Only issue is it tends to drain your battery. Now I have a full-size Kindle 3G and I am addicted to that too :)
B001UV4XHY|1.0|Many reviewers complain about the darkness of the picture quality which I soundly second.  However, this has been a problem with the last few Potter DVDs we have purchased, not to mention an increasing graininess of the overall picture quality, so I began to assume this was the look the director was going for.  So while it has been quite difficult to make out what is going on in some of the scenes, my primary complaint with this DVD has been that the fast action/fight scenes freeze and unfreeze throughout the action resulting in a very jerky effect.  The chase through the woods is not fun to watch given the way in which the scene was shot coupled with this freeze/unfreeze movement. When this occurred with a video rented from Netflicks, I thought we had a well used video.  Just bought our own copy from Best Buy yesterday and the problem seems even worse.  A number of reviewers point to WB making cheap film to dvd transfer in an effort to \\"force\\" consumers to switch to blu-ray technology.  Oddly enough this seems plausible and I plan on making a complaint to the FTC, not to mention probably not buying Deathly Hallows II.
0525950079|5.0|I read Pillars of the Earth for the first time last year and bought World Without End expecting a great book but a bit of a let down and I was wrong! This book is the best example along with pillars, of historical fiction the way it ought to be done. I think I even like this better than Pillars. It is just the highest example of historical fiction and was a joy to read and makes me wish I could run up and down the street advocating that people read this book. Great characters, great interwoven stories, great time period to have a story told in, and just a superb effort by a writer with god given talent. This is my new favorite book of all time. Now onto Fall of Giants...
B002I9Z8EO|4.0|This is a fun movie, filled with little bits and pieces of Trek trivia or fun facts.  Alfre Woodard is very good as the wide-eyed civilian taking her first ride on a space ship.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Go ahead on, my brother!  Did the old timers who heard you tell us you were this good?  William Gibson (sifi writer) says that it is hard to imagine the past.  True that.    A voice and style surpassed by none.  Frank who?     Imagine, after 100 years, you should be an overnight sensation.  If you are not, there is some karmic disorder in the time-space continuum.        I tried listening at work but I couldn't do the volume right.  In my truck on the way to work is a sweet spot.  This is the best vocal of any type in a long time.  Props to the techies, you did good.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I love it already. Only a day with it in hand.. and I'm a huge fan. I've only had brandon boyd's solo stuff to hold me over for the past 5 years... and now that incubus finally released their new record... i can honestly say that it's PERFECT! Yes, they have grown and matured as a band... so it sounds a bit different than their previous stuff.. but nonetheless it is AWESOME!
1594744769|5.0|Excellent story.  I couldn't put it down.  As would many people, I looked at all of the photo's before I began to read.  As the story unfolded answers for questions or parts of mysteries unfolded.
1451629184|5.0|Hard to imagine that a book of this nature is uplifting, I know. But it is. Most of the abuse is covered in the first part of the book--it's detailed, yes, but don't let that discourage you. To hear how she survived, the things she wrote, felt, and the coping mechanisms she used are incredible and needs to be heard. It is absolutley a story of stregnth and survival. Jamie Lee is without question a survivor, and a very strong, intelligent, forgiving one at that.     In the book she makes a list of a few things she wants to accomplish...there is one she already has, and the rest--I hope that she does every single thing on that list and more. She derserves every penny she makes from the book (although she is giving a portion to her charity), and I hope that she and her girls are set for the rest of her life so they can have the life they deserve.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Plenty of other reviewers have detailed the jist of the script. Just wanted to say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, even though I knew it had received good reviews.  It is well acted and well paced with an all star cast that almost feels underused. The pacing is solid and there are enough twists to keep viewers occupied while still supplying a reasonable ending.  Not sure if it is an enduring work of art, but definitely a good bucket of popcorn night of entertainment.
B001K3JF7K|2.0|As the title indicates, Diana sings \\"quietly\\", slightly above a whisper, to slow standards and a couple of bossa nova songs. I kept waiting for a change of pace and fighting off napping.  Am disappointed because I am a true fan and would have loved to hear tunes that show her real talent in rendering songs in her unique jazzy style and piano virtuosity.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I am a huge fan of Stephen King, and have read a large number of his books.  Out of all of them, The Long Walk is definitely one of his best.  The dialogue is superb and the characters are believable.  King writes in a way as to make you scramble for more.  When I picked up the book, I didn't put it down until I was finished.

B00425S1H8|5.0|This product even worked with my piece of junk motion stage in my lab.  My motion stage is about 15 years old and very flaky and to my surprise this converter worked just fine with it.  One issue I had was that the program to control the stage wasn't recognizing that the stage was plugged into the computer.  Turns out that the converter was attaching the stage to COM port 3 and not COM port 1.  So if you are having connectivity issues, try going into the hardware folder on your computer and looking up which port the converter is using.

0962477060|1.0|I first got this a few years ago when I started playing guitar. Looking back, I can't recommend this book.<br /><br />The one good thing about it is it introduced me to the CAGED system. The idea is: if you play these chord shapes at different positions on the neck: C at the open position, A at the 3rd, G at the 5th, E at the 8th, and D at the 10th position with appropriate barreing - they will all sound like the C chord, but use the shapes of C, A, G, E, and D chords.<br /><br />What's more, you can permute this. If you start with A in the open position, you can play the AGEDC shapes up the neck (with appropriate spacings) and they will sound like the A chord. Similarly, the scale patterns repeat in a predictable way on the neck.<br /><br />As a beginner, this was cool. But then the rest of the book was really confusing. After a few days I put this book away and haven't really looked at until I wrote this review.<br /><br />The book is really wordy - the CAGED overview lasts ~20 pages. Even now that I have a better grasp of theory, I still can't get through his description of how to find lead patterns, triads, arpeggios, modes, and chords. Instead of getting this book, I suggest reading up on the CAGED method on the internet and then try one of the following books:<br /><br />If you actually want to really learn the fretboard, I think the best book out there is the [[ASIN:0634049011 Guitar Fretboard Workbook]] by Barrett Tagliarino which will ask you to figure out the patterns yourself (after teaching you some basic theory).<br /><br />I personally like Bruce Emery's Music Principles for the The Skeptical Guitarist series: [[ASIN:0966502906 Music Principles for the Skeptical Guitarist Vol. 1 : The Big Picture]] and [[ASIN:0966502914 Music Principles for the Skeptical Guitarist, Volume 2 'The Fretboard']] which goes over theory (in Vol. 1) and the CAGED system in Vol. 2.

B004WKOCP8|2.0|First some qualifications so I can put the review in context.  I've liked Incubus since S.C.I.E.N.C.E and have seen them live (just the once around 10 years ago...a bit boring to be honest).  I do listen to a lot of genres and it's very rare that I buy an album that I do not like...and I own hundreds of CD's.    After hearing adolescents I had high(er) hopes, as well as knowing Brendan O'Brien was at the wheel.  Well my hopes were dashed.  The rest of the album is wallpaper...music to sleep by basically.  Brandon sounds great, but there's just no energy, and that's what I expect from this band.  I think Mike Einziger took the day off ...unless the mix is really bad (which with Brendan producing is not likely).    I know a lot of reviews suggest people just accept the music for what it is and you'll come to appreciate it...but I bought this because it's Incubus!  If I wanted an album that sounds like Coldplay having a bad day I'd just buy their next album :)  (And I like Coldplay...)  Honestly, this album is just boring...it's just bad music.    Just go stream it and make up your own mind.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Once I started this book, I had a hard time putting it down.  Jaycee's story is riviting, and I'm amazed at how much she does remember from that horrible time.  I hope that her story will encourage law enforcement to improve their monitoring of people on parole.      The book was amazing considering she only has a fifth grade education.  I was a bit disappointed that her editors didn't catch a few typos and grammatical mistakes, as they should have known this book would likely be a best seller.      Regardless, Jaycee is an inspiration to me.  I hope that she gets to experience all of the life dreams she documented in the book.  She already has a good start on some of those, and she can now cross writing a best seller off of her list of dreams.    Jaycee, if you're reading these reviews, I am in awe of how you survived such an ordeal.  I live close to Lake Tahoe, and think of you often as I watch my children play on the beaches and playgrounds near the lake.  Your story reminds me to stay vigilent in protecting my children as much as I can.  The story of the love between you and your mother is so touching, and I'm glad that you had the blessing of your own daughters to get you through a horrible time.  I wish you all of the best, and hope you get that house by the beach, a house with horses, continued writing success, and anything else your heart desires.  God bless you.

B0051BVQFG|1.0|I was only able to watch 10 minutes of this and nearly had to throw up due to the awful camera work.  You get the feeling that this flick was filmed with a bunch of home cameras by people inept at operating those devices.  Perhaps this is part of a visual effect to make the film feel more real, but how can one get lost in the story when every few seconds they switch cameras, zoom in and out, point the camera into the sun so that the actor is barely visible.  Whoever decided to shoot the film this way should have chosen a career at Taco Bell.
B000CBUSWW|2.0|I have heard and read about people with more than  one identity, but this guy drives me nutz!. The vhs I viewed was not good quality, but Sophia looked great! In retrospect, I would not recommend this movie.
B0036TGSIK|2.0|**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br /><br />There were several parts I found irritating.  Like Olive’s dad who sees Olive sewing a revealing outfit and tells her to “give them hell.”  He doesn’t bother asking why she’d want to raise hell, what kind of hell she'd be raising, or how she can solve her problems more maturely.  And this lazy parenting style is portrayed as cool.<br /><br />Another irritation is the hypocritical message about not judging others.  Throughout the film, Olive preaches against judging others, yet harshly judges the Catholics in this film, who are all portrayed as one dimensional, intolerant, know-it-alls. Now granted, people like this exist - even Athiests - but there are reasonable believers as well, which are conveniently left out of the film.<br /><br />My main irritation, though, is the message about what to do if you know someone is being cheated on.  Olive discovers a beloved teacher is being cheated on, but instead of telling him, she protects his wife’s secret, ruining her own reputation in the process.  In an act of revenge, she blurts out the truth to the teacher, which he follows up by getting a divorce.  Olive then blames herself for breaking up their marriage.<br /><br />However, the truth didn’t break up his marriage.  His wife’s lies did.  She also had poor character.  She condones Olive ruining her reputation for her and blames her husband for her cheating, claiming he was sexually withholding.  However, in an earlier scene, the husband tried to get sexual with her, but she was the one rejecting him.  For argument's sake, though, lets say it was sexually barren, since she had healthier options available (work on the marriage or divorce), it's not his fault she chose greed instead.<br /><br />Telling the truth would've validated the movie’s message about people having the right to make their own decisions.  Had Olive continued to withhold the truth, the teacher would’ve been denied that right.  He would've beendenied the right to make an informed decision to stay married. And given his wife had chlamydia, too, the truth becomes especially important.their own decisions.  If she had kept the truth from him, then he wouldn't have the knowledge to make an informed decision to stay married or divorce.    I understand neither the wife nor the student wanted him to choose divorce, but that wasn't their choice alone to make.  It was his, too...and his freedom to choose shouldn't be stripped away from him.      I also understand the student wanted to protect his feelings, but lying doesn't protect him, it protects his wife.  And his wife was awful.  Not only did the wife condone the main character further ruining her rep for her, but she had the audacity to blame her husband for her infidelity.  She claimed he didn't pay enough attention to her sexually and then when this handsome student did, she went for it.  But earlier, when the husband tried to get sexual with her, it was the wife who pushed him away. Also, if things were as bad as she claimed, then why didn't she get a divorce first?     And finally, during the affair, the wife contracted chlamydia.  The husband had the right to know his health would be jeopardized by having sex with his wife.      Earlier I said the main character had some funny zingers that made me laugh out loud, however, after awhile she also came across as whiney, too.     I mean, she sets out to get negative attention by wearing revealing clothes and then when she gets it, she plays the victim card, acting like she's being bullied.  So apparently, it's ok for her to poke others, but when others poke back, they're just being mean.     Overall, this movie had it's funny moments, but those moments were overshadowed by messages that were either hypocritical or stripped others of their right to make their own decisions.
B004VUP8WK|1.0|When you buy a Morbid Angel album, you should never have to listen through the songs beforehand; you know what you are getting. They are a legendary death metal band, you are buying a death metal album. Period. This album should have been great- the return of David Vincent, fans waiting in anticipation for 10 (?) years, etc. When i got this album, I put it in my CD player, listened to the intro, seriously excited for this album. Then the first track came on.<br /><br />What you hear after ten years of anticipating this release, is not death metal. What you hear is a techno drum beat, and not like a Rammstein-esque electronic sort of thing, but full on techno \\"in the club\\" B.S. I listened for about 30 seconds, discovered that, to my extreme disappointment, the techno wasn't going away, and changed tracks. About half (HALF) of the tracks on this steaming pile of trash feature these electronic samples throughout, along with  vomit inducing lyrics (Radikult is just so bad it's offensive).<br /><br />The heavy, good ol' fashioned death metal tracks on this album just don't make up for the techno crap. What Morbid Angel have given us loyal fans after ten years is so bad, so cheesy it makes bands like Ratt look bad ass. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone- this should not be part of Morbid Angel's catalog. This album is - literally - one of the biggest disappointments of my entire life. It was such a let down- these guys know what the fans expected, and to give them techno/pseudo goth rock is unacceptable. I would be shocked if this band can bounce back from a turd like this, it is literally just that bad. Stay away.<br /><br />And so I don't come across as a pessimist, it can be said that Mr. Vincent's growl still sounds awesome, and Trey's guitar solos are possibly the best sounding ever. Too bad none of that matters, as they are featured on THE WORST METAL ALBUM EVER MADE.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I bought this the same night I watched the TV special interview and downloaded it and read it the next day. I'm glad I did. Normally, I won't pay this much for a Kindle e-book, but for this brave woman, I handed over the bucks without complaint.    Jaycee is frank about what happened to her. This book is not full of expertly-written prose. What it is full of is the feelings, thoughts and experiences of a girl who endured unspeakable things and came out on the other side a remarkably well-adjusted woman.    I do wish she would have included a little more details about hers and her daughters daily living conditions, and what happened to her captors afterward, but I won't ding her on the reviews over it. After what she endured, Jaycee had the right to write what she wants. This is HER story to tell as she sees fit.    Good luck, Jaycee. I hope you can seek and find the one true GOD, and not the twisted version your captor showed you.

B004WKOCP8|3.0|*I've since dropped my rating to 3 after listening to Brandon Boyd's solo effort \\"The Wild Trapeze\\"  Um, this is basically the same album.<br /><br />If Not Now, When? to me is an album made up of all those filler tracks on old Incubus records.  What I consider to be filler tracks are the slower songs, songs like \\"Dig\\", \\"Love Hurts\\", \\"Echo\\", \\"Drive\\", etc.  I know, some of those songs were big hits, I don't mean anything negative by the term filler track.  The songs, at the time, seemed disconnected from the Incubus album.sound, they were slower, often acoustic, and were more I guess you could say, sensitive.  Over the years these songs began to take up more and more space on an Incubus record so I am not at all surprised that If Not Now, When? is basically 9 tracks of these songs with 2 sort of kickback songs (Adolescents, Switchblade) which come from the ACLOTM era (see Pistola and Megalomaniac).  In the past I wanted to slit my wrists when Love Hurts came on (and I still do), for some reason this album for the most part, doesn't give me nausea.<br /><br />Track 1-  Terrible<br /><br />Track 2-  Catchy little tune here, this is what record companies love.<br /><br />Track 3-  Mike's guitar riff is so simple but is beautiful in the song.  Paints a great picture.<br /><br />Track 4-  Bit more uptempo but seems to miss just a bit.<br /><br />Track 5-  Very nice acoustic song, cool story.<br /><br />Track 6-  Beautiful song but the chorus ruins it.  There aren't many guys who are going to be rolling down the windows of the car with this song playing.<br /><br />Track 7-  Nice little 2 minute acoustic.<br /><br />Track 8-  Pretty cool song and very good live.<br /><br />Track 9-  Nice song, reminds me of pistola but can't help but be disappointed a bit that it isn't as good as priceless.<br /><br />Track 10-  Very nice opening single and as I read, has pissed a lot of people off because it was good and doesn't represent the album AT ALL.<br /><br />Track 11-  Maybe tried to go Aqueous Transmission on us but didn't work out.<br /><br />Overall this album is good filler, very good filler, and I think they'll play well in shuffle.  How sweet would the majority of these songs be if they were tucked in between a couple of harder tracks?  So, 4 stars, for it's shuffle worthiness., very good filler, and I think they'll play well in shuffle.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The 2005 version of Pride & Prejudice is a great movie, to be sure, to help connect modern audiences with this masterpiece. Indeed, I hated Jane Austen for 23 years, the time between high school British Lit class and that when I first saw this film in 2006.<br /><br />A couple of notes on the version. Macfadyen is not quite the actor that Olivier was, but he seems very real as Mr. Darcy. In fact, when he appeared in Frost/Nixon, I silently exclaimed, \\"it's bleach-blond Mr. Darcy!\\" The role sticks to him as if he were superglued to it.<br /><br />Mr. Collins is rather serious, almost to the point of mean spirited, whereas Jane Austen's version (and 1940 and 1995 screen versions) paint him as comic relief, a buffoon.<br /><br />Keira Knightly is perhaps the most adorable Lizzie of all, certainly one whom viewers can easily relate to and even befriend. Donald Sutherland is in the middle of the pack as Mr. Bennett overall, but his father/daughter relationship with Lizzie is rather warm indeed!<br /><br />Cinematographically, a bit too modern... two camera elements should be used more judiciously: Zoom/Perspective, and camera angle. In the former, there's no aesthetic benefit to seeing such frequent close-ups of characters when they speak. The two zoom close ups of Mr. Darcy's hand after it had touched Elizabeth's were obvious, nearly to the point of offensive to this viewer.<br /><br />As for the latter, perhaps a bit too much camera acrobatics... in a few scenes, I thought the camera was a supporting actor jealous of the attention given the star, trying to seize the spotlight where it could. The camera was a bit too dramatic at times in angle and movement.<br /><br />The classic (1940) employs both of these techniques, but they are so subtle as to be moving and effective, without distracting the viewer by causing their stomach to jolt with constant gritty emotion. Pride and Prejudice is a fine experience, not a visceral one.<br /><br />I'm compelled to point out one instance where zoom was properly used. At the end of the film, where Darcy and Elizabeth finally declare their love for each other, the use of restrained zoom on the couple was a rather moving as it created a romantic portrait. I felt sparks fly all over my body (as opposed to jolts in my entrails).<br /><br />Despite what I consider cinematographic shortcomings, I love the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice. It opened the door to Jane Austen for me. Nevertheless, it took a first viewing of the Olivier (1940) version five years later to finally pull me in entirely, to hook me on Jane Austen, deeply and permanently.film, where Darcy and Elizabeth finally declare their love for each other, the use of restrained zoom on the couple was a rather moving as it created a romantic portrait.

0596805888|5.0|I've always lacked interest in cooking, but I'd love to know how. This book makes it fun, by treating it as a science experiment. Even if you don't plan to cook, still interesting to sit down as read. It can also help you appreciate the flavors of your food, or just knowing how it was cooked and why it has a certain texture, taste, color, etc. It certainly enhances my mealtime.

0316056863|4.0|Tina Fey is a very funny, smart, and talented lady, and reading this biography/memoir feels like I imagine sitting down and talking to her would be.  I am a fan of memoirs but I have read so many about dysfunctional families, about people who have survived abuse, and it is really refreshing to read something so much more upbeat.  Actually, I would have liked to learn more about Fey's early life.  A good part of the book was about her days at SNL and 30 Rock.<br /><br />Rather than being self-aggrandizing, Ms. Fey pokes fun at herself.  There is some name-dropping but not in a mean spirit.  There are, however, mentions of unnamed \\"d-bags.\\"<br /><br />In discussing her famous (or infamous, depending on your point of view) spoof of Sarah Palin, she says \\"I am not mean and Mrs. Palin is not fragile.\\"<br /><br />This is a funny book, and I did laugh out loud several times, but it is more than just humor.  For my taste, there was a little too much repetition of SNL and 30 Rock jokes.  The bit about the Teat Nazis was was hilarious.  And writing about family size, she says \\"Large families have become a status symbol in New York.  Four beautiful children named after kings and pieces of fruit are a way of saying 'I can afford a four-bedroom apartment and $150,000 in elementary school tuition fees each year.  How you livin'?'\\".  Once in awhile, it felt like she was trying just too hard to be funny, but most of it worked well for me.<br /><br />There is some profanity that might be off-putting to some readers, but probably not to most readers who would be interested in this book.  Altogether, it was highly entertaining, light read about a very interesting and successful woman.

B004UID2LC|1.0|I'd prefer my original YouTube player back.  I tried uninstalling this and the original player no longer works.  If I go to update the original player it just says &quot;installed&quot;.  I reinstalled this app... I'm stuck with this app for all my YouTube now.
B0042816YK|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in this movie as Julia Roberts is one of my favorites, however this was slow getting into, maybe just too much deepness with out enough fun and action.
B0034CNSFU|5.0|Don't let the best music EVER written be forgotten.This CD gives the best music  eternal life with the best 20 songs written by the best guitar player of all time. Shipping was fast, product was well protected, a little scratch on the case( no big deal), and the disk looked brand new. If your looking for a great gift for a Jimi Hendrix fan, look no further. I don't have to tell you how it sounded because it's Jimi!!!!
B004RQVVGU|3.0|This IS perhaps my favorite all time album.. before this was released we were promised demos and rarities - where are they? We get live footage? Live footage that may sound different but is virtually the same set.. and why NOT a DIARY set? There HAS to MORE than this out there for us fans who mourn the absolute greatest guitarist in history.. I am glad Ozzy put right was wronged by reinserting the original drums and bass, but again, I already have that from original cd's. At the very LEAST he could have put the After Hours on a remastered disc and included that as a video or even the audio in that which sounds MUCH different than the Tribute cd... It really pains me to give this 3 stars but I was promised more than this and I'm a bit ticked, all the press I read before this release pointed to \\"demos, rarities, and outtakes\\" and we get live stuff..again? Ugh. Randy deserves better, and so do we.

0061784788|5.0|Reading some of the other reviews, I realize that I'm not going to be able to write a book report to match these pros, nor will I turn away a good book, picking nits on style, but the whole package.  Here's my recreational reader review.<br /><br />I was turned on to Rollins by a friend about 8 months ago and I started through his Sigma Force novels at the beginning and have been waiting for this one.  I really enjoyed this book and finished it in a week - it was hard to put down, but that's what you get with all of his books.  If you've read any of his previous books and enjoyed them, this is an easy purchase.  If you enjoy Clive Cussler, Jack DuBrul, Patrick Robinson, Brian Haig...  this novel is well in the same theme of enjoyable recreational adventure fiction.  I encourage you to read the series from the beginning to truly enjoy the character development, but each also stands on its own.
B004TTOOQO|4.0|Films about British colonialism were popular in the 30s, if for no other reason than the impending World War was sufficient rationale to show Britain's might. Hence we have such classics as \\"Charge of the Light Brigade\\" (1936) with Errol Flynn and \\"Gunga Gin\\" (1939) with Victor McLaglen, Cary Grant, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Of lesser note are the so-called \\"Empire trilogy\\" from famed producer Alexander Korda - \\"Sanders of the River\\" (1936) with Leslie Banks and Paul Robeson, \\"The Drum\\" (1938) with Raymond Massey and Valerie Hobson, and this film, \\"Four Feathers\\".<br /><br />Alexander Korda (1893-1956) produced nearly 60 films in his career that started in 1923 in Hungary. His break through film was \\"The Private Life of Henry VIII\\" (1933) and there followed a series of historical dramas including \\"Rise of Catherine the Great\\" (1934), \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" (1934) and \\"Rembrandt\\" (1936). He was extremely pro-England and made films like \\"Clouds Over Europe\\" (1939), \\"The Lion Has Wings\\" (1939), and \\"That Hamilton Woman\\" (1941).<br /><br />His younger brother, Zoltan (1895-1961) directed 20 films and was twice nominated for an award at Cannes (\\"Cry the Beloved Country\\", \\"The Four Feathers\\"). Shortly after making this film he moved to the US where he made \\"Dark Journey\\" (1941), \\"The Thief of Bagdad\\" (1940) and \\"Jungle Book\\" (1942).<br /><br />\\"The Four Feathers\\" is based on a 1902 novel by British writer A. Mason (who also wrote \\"Fire Over England\\"). It was filmed in 1915, 1921 and again in 1929. - the 1929 version directed by Merian Cooper and starring Fay Wray (they worked together again in 1933 on \\"King Kong\\") was the last major Hollywood silent film.<br /><br />FWIW - Producer and RKO head Merian Cooper had been a POW in Russia in 1920 and one of his sources of sustenance was reading a copy of \\"Four Feathers\\". When he made the film in 1929 he incorporate some episodes from his own life, including his imprisonment and escape, into the movie.<br /><br />This version stars John Clements, Ralph Richardson, C. Aubrey Smith, and June Duprez. The story takes place in 1895 when an expedition is being prepared to avenge the death of General Gordon in Khartoum, Sudan, 10 years earlier. Just prior to leaving, a British officer (Clements) resigns his commission and his 3 friends and fianc&eacute;e each send him a white feather - signaling they consider him a coward. Clements faces his fears, ships off to the Sudan, and attempts to redeem himself by rescuing his friends who have been captured by the natives.<br /><br />The film's star John Clements (1910-88) is virtually forgotten today. He was popular in the late 30s and 40s and made nearly 30 films between 1935 and 1982. His role in \\"Four Feathers\\" was the high point in his career.<br /><br />June Duprez (1918-84) is also not a household name. She made fewer than 20 films between 1936 and 1961 and this was her most prominent role to date. She followed this film with a starring role as the Princess in \\"The Thief of Bagdad\\" (1940). She was a favorite of Zorda who used her in many of his films.<br /><br />Ralph Richardson (1902-83) plays a Captain and one of Clements' friends. He was nominated for  an Oscar for \\"The Heiress\\" (1949) and \\"Greystoke\\" (1984), won the Best Supporting Actor from the NY Film critics for \\"Greystoke\\" (1984) and \\"Breaking The Sound Barrier\\" (1952), and won Best Actor at Cannes for \\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\\" (1962). Richardson made more than 50 films between 1933 and 1985. I remember him best in \\"Time Bandits\\" (1981) as the Supreme Being and as the befuddled Inspector Hammond from \\"Clouds Over Europe\\" (1939).<br /><br />C. Aubrey Smith (1863-1948) plays a retired General and father of Duprez. Smith was a great actor known for his roles as an aristocrat. He appeared in more than 100 films from 1915 to 1949. He gave us memorable roles in a host of films, including Major Hamilton in \\"The Lives of a Bengal Lancer\\" (1935) and Lord Capulet in \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" (1936).I remember him best as Col. Williams in \\"Wee Willie Winkie\\" (1937) with Shirley Temple.<br /><br />FWIW - Korda, Clements, Richardson, and Smith were all knighted.<br /><br />Miklos Rozsa (1907-95) was a fellow Hungarian and often worked with Zorda. He scored more than 100 films and earned 16 Oscar nominations and 3 wins (\\"A Double Life\\", \\"Spellbound\\", \\"Ben Hur\\").<br /><br />Cinematographer Georges Perinal (1897-1965) was nominated for an Oscar for this film and \\"The Thief of Bagdad\\" (1940). He filmed 70 movies between 1926 and 1960. Much of the filming was done on location in the Sudan.<br /><br />The film was nominated for an Oscar for Color Cinematography and for Best Picture at Cannes and at the Venice Film festival.<br /><br />Nowadays the notions of honor and country are different than they were in the 30s, so a proper viewing of this film must take the changing ethos into consideration. As well, the British Empire and indeed the notion of being British is far different from what it was, so adjustments are required to appreciate this film, as they are with many of the 30s films.<br /><br />That being said, my favorite British colonial films are \\"Gunga Din\\" (1939) and \\"Charge of the Light Brigade\\" (1936). Add to this \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" (1962), \\"Zulu\\" (1964), \\"Shaka Zulu\\" (1986), \\"Ghandi\\" (1982), \\"Gallipoli\\" (1981), and \\"The Man who Would be King\\" (1975).irley Temple.

B004ZQBOXC|3.0|Can LMFAO really be serious? Probably not, but the group's sophomore effort [[ASIN:B004ZQBOXC Sorry for Party Rocking]] surprisingly works, despite its ludicrous conception.  Sure, it won't be recounted as as the classic album of 2011, but in a market that is so fixed on the `latest trend,' Sorry for Party Rocking's infectious, stupid, club-savvy nature works in its favor.  After all, if the Black Eyed Peas and 3OH!3 can thrive off of the `stupid,' why can't LMFAO.  Honestly, Sorry for Party Rocking trumps the latest efforts by both groups.  And face it, with \\"Mr. Corny\\" himself will.i.am at the helm as executive producer, wouldn't one expect one of the `stupidest' efforts ever?  While some may splurge for the deluxe edition, Sorry for Party Rocking's standard edition is enough for the casual listener, despite it's brief 37 minute duration.<br /><br />\\"Rock The Beat II\\" opens the effort, `intro' style, with captivating production work that comprises of a dizzying array of synths and electronics.  The group raps a bit, setting the tone of the album.  The title track follows (\\"Sorry for Party Rocking\\") with great success.  The production is solid and the `party vibe' of the album is overtly conveyed.  The chorus is great - well catchy and silly which makes it viable for this effort: \\"People always say my music's loud/sorry for party rocking...\\" The #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit \\"Party Rock Anthem\\" proceeds, featuring performances by Lauren Bennett and Goonrock.  The production is solid, the hook is catchy (despite immaturity), and the cut itself ends up being a `guilty pleasure.' The best line? \\"Everyday I'm shuffling.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sexy And I Know It\\" is a silly as anything else, but that's the point.  The hook is stupid, but addictive: \\"When I walk in the spot, this is what I see/everybody stops and they staring at me...I'm sexy and I know it.\\" Other notable lines: \\"We hit it to the bar, baby don't be nervous/now shows, no shirt, and I still get serviced...\\" \\"Champagne Showers\\" is better, featuring Natalia Kills on vocals.  The driving dance groove continues once more truly epitomizing the classic line \\"the beat goes on.\\"  Kills's vocals are laden with processing, but then what else do you expect on a dance record? The production is stand-out, the hook as stupid as anything else, and you find yourself singing the cut to yourself despite the fact `you should know better.'  \\"One Day\\" is a bit less enthralling from the onset, but settles into another enjoyable cut led by it's easily dismissible hook: \\"Money in the bank, my car brand new/I got everything I want, but you...\\" Geez, these boys are corny!<br /><br />\\"Take It To The Hole\\" is ridiculous, but brilliant.  The production is handled by Rami Afuni (most of the other cuts are handled by LFMAO) which smartly differentiates the sound a bit. The hook is as stupid as all others - possibly even more so: \\"Take it to the hole, take, take it to the hole...I beat it up...\\" Redfoo is good for some one-liners: \\"I take it to the hole, its Redfoo I'm aggressive/Four moves ahead, wrong dude to play chess with/I roll with the best click flow so impressive...\\" Busta Rhymes `puts a cap on it' with a superb guest rap here.  \\"Best Night\\" works, but at five minutes in duration, makes the listener a bit weary, will.i.am feature or not.  \\"All Night Long\\" reinstates any lost energy with sound production and yet another addictive hook.  Closing cut \\"With You\\" is not the best of the album, but ends the album solidly enough with captivating production being a highlight.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004ZQBOXC Sorry for Party Rocking]] is one of those efforts that you take for what it is - an utterly ridiculous pop album that is meant to be a `guilty pleasure.'  This is not an album that will win or even hope to be nominated for `Album of the Year,' but for `what it is,' it works.  After all, after you listen to it, you can say you're \\"sorry for party rocking.\\"er, featuring Natalia Kills on vocals.

B004L79VUI|2.0|I wanted to like this collection of songs from the great Robbie  Robertson.  And all the details surrounding it sure sounded great - including Clapton's presence and contribution.  But I was seriously let down by it.  His vocals don't do well over the course of an entire album.  He lacks the pipes and the expressiveness needed to anchor these songs.  That breathy, talky-style stuff only goes so far before it becomes monotone, expressionless and boring.  The songs, themselves, are lyrically sub-par.  It's hard to believe this is the guy who wrote all of that classic material before. This stuff seems obvious, awkward even - with no real inspiration or revelation.  Considering the personal issues he dealing with - he does so in the most generic fashion.  There's very little insight to be found here.  And musically, well, it's just a yawn.  Middle of the road, mid-tempo - nothing burns or sizzles.  Neil was right - it's better to burn out than fade away.   A little honest-to-goodness passion would go a long way here  - instead it feels like an attempt at ultra-cool posturing.  I know a lot of people have posted highly positive reviews - but I wonder how many times they'll actually be turning the thing on and listening to it all the way through.
B0045JEPXU|4.0|Pitbull's sixth effort [[ASIN:B0045JEPXU Planet Pit]] is chocked full of hits `gift-wrapped' for the clubs.  While Planet Pit should only be a `guilty pleasure,' it turns out that Planet Pit is a sound release that stands on its own aside from just being a club album.  Pit's rhymes are sound throughout, but the attention may be most drawn from the exceptional production work that graces the album as well as a smart choice of collaborators that further accentuate the LP.  There are shockingly no overt misses making Planet Pit a bright spot in the 2011 rap market.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Worldwide (intro)\\" opens the album featuring and produced by Vein.  The intro opens with typical, Latin rap driven-pop production work, which foreshadows the content of Planet Pit. The effort explodes with first single, the exceptional \\"Give Me Everything,\\" which features sound contributions from Ne-Yo, Afrojack (who also produces), and Nayer.  The intro sets up the track strongly finding Pitbull quasi-rapping: \\"Me not working hard?/Yeah Right! Picture that with a Kodak...\\"  Ne-Yo `holds down' the effort with a sound vocal performance on this #1 Billboard Hot 100 hit: \\"Grab somebody sexy, tell `em hey/give me everything tonight...\\" Overall, everything works perfectly with \\"Give Me Everything.\\" The Marc Anthony featured standout \\"Rain Over Me\\" picks up where \\"Give Me Everything\\" left off, providing yet another solid cut.  RedOne & Jimmy Joker handle the boards here on this Euro-pop/Latin production to superb success. Aside from Anthony's catchy hook, the best moment might be the bridge section where the cut changes pace: \\"...I was playing with here, she was playing with me/next thing you know, were were playing with three...\\"<br /><br />\\"Hey Baby (Drop It To The Floor)\\" features T-Pain `doing his thing' as usual.  Sandy Vee's production is great and keeps up the `driving, club vibe' of this effort, getting Planet Pit off to a rollicking start.  \\"Pause\\" doesn't disappoint in the slightest, changing the production scope ever so slightly (Affect, DJ Buddha & Apster produce here) with an exceptional percussive groove that is amongst the best of the effort.  Brevity works in the favor of \\"Pause\\" as an over saturation of infectious, dance-grooves may have threatened to derail Planet Pit ever so slightly.  The Enrique Iglesias featured \\"Come N Go\\" is solid too, finding Dr. Luke & Benny Blanco (Ke$ha, Britney Spears, Katy Perry, etc.) handling production duties.  \\"Shake Se&ntilde;ora\\" is easily one of the album's strongest outings, finding a sound collaborative effort between Pitbull, T-Pain & Sean Paul.  Clinton Sparks & DJ Snake change he pace of the production, which breaks up any weariness of the constant groove that characterizes the effort.  Sean Paul's guest spot is exceptional while T-Pain's hook receives an `A+': \\"...shawty what's happening/girl let's get this thing rocking/you just bend it on over/I'll get behind you and bring it...\\" Definitely a hit.<br /><br />\\"International Love\\" features a superb sounding Chris Brown, with his best showing being the R&B bridge section.  \\"Castle Made of Sand\\" smartly contrasts the driving Latin-dance production for a slightly more conventional, mainstream rap sound.  Kelly Rowland `kills' the refrain while Jamie Drastik provides a solid rap verse.  \\"Too My Love\\" features none other than Red Foo (LMFAO), Vein & David Rush.  \\"Took My Love\\" sounds very much like a LMFAO song given the fact that Red Foo is behind the boards.  It is by no means a miss, but it is a bit weaker than the very best cuts.  \\"Where Do We Go,\\" the penultimate cut, serves as atonement featuring an unlikely Jamie Foxx as Pit's collaborator.  Foxx holds it down as always while producer Jim Jonsin `stitches up' one of the best and tightest productions of the entire album.  Closing number \\"Something for the DJs\\" finds David Guetta and Afrojack collaborating on the production and ends the album solidly.  The best line: \\"If you're sexy and you know it,clap your hands.\\"<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B0045JEPXU Planet Pit]] turns out to be a pleasant surprise. It is very much a dance/club album, but it is very enjoyable across the board.  Pitbull contributes only his best on this album and may draw a new legion of fans because of this album.

B004K7HMJ6|3.0|Unfortunately for the artist, many times both critics and music fans/enthusiasts often `sleep' on albums, even if they purchased them when they first materialized.  That is the case with Jessie J's [[ASIN:B004K7HMJ6 Who You Are]], the debut effort from the British starlet who has come to be known for her moderate hit \\"Price Tag,\\" featuring American rap standout B.o.B.  The album is an alluring pop album by all means, showcasing Jessica Cornish's (Jessie J) Christina Aguilera-rivaling pipes.  The album debut just outside of the top ten in the U.S. which is a shame considering it is a solid affair for the most part.<br /><br />Dr. Luke produces the enthusiastic first single, \\"Price Tag,\\" which features a guest spot from the ubiquitous B.o.B.  The production work still channels Dr. Luke, but has a slightly more soulful-pop edge than normal for the producer.  The chorus is the selling point: \\"It's not about they money money money, we don't need your money money money, we just wanna make the world dance, forget about the price tag...\\" \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" follows up the excellent cut with another solid cut, also notable for its refrain.  Jessie J sounds great, though she may over-sing the slightest bit.  \\"Abracadabra\\" is enjoyable as well, finding Dr. Luke behind the boards once more.  Aided by songwriting by Dr. Luke & Claude Kelly, Jessie J pulls off another enjoyable cut that showcases her prodigious vocal abilities.<br /><br />\\"Big White Room,\\" a live, acoustic cut, proves to be among the `cream of the crop,' but is somewhat hampered due to it's odd placement.  The cut appears fourth on this effort where it probably would have been best served at or towards the end.  Regardless, Jessie's own personal composition is killer, showcasing her in a `singer/songwriter' vein and differentiating from both previous and later cuts.  \\"Casualty of Love\\" possesses and exceptional soulful-urban vibe about it, contrasting the singer/songwriter edge of \\"Big White Room.\\" \\"Rainbow,\\" another solid cut (though not revolutionary), once again contrasts the track preceding it, and showcases Jessie J's gift o'er and o'er again.  \\"Whose Laughing Now\\" is enjoyable, finding the chanteuse singing/pop-rapping.<br /><br />\\"Do It Like A Dude\\" is an instant standout, produced by The Invisible Men with Parker & James in a \\"Tricky\\" Stewart/The-Dream-style production.  While the cut is a bit overt - OK very overt - it is one of the best of the effort.  \\"Mama Knows Best\\" tames the beast of Jessie down, well as far as the profanity and overt sexual references, placing her against a production palette that recalls big-band meets funk-soul.  \\"L.O.V.E.\\" contrasts once more, in favor of a reggae-tinged pop love song that finds its muse singing: \\"you're my key, you unlock me/keep me close, keep me safe, keep me happy/So sweet, oh love/it's destiny, so nothing stops me/I'll tell the world that you're mine and you got me so...\\"  \\"L.O.V.E\\" definitely exhibits solid songwriting (Jessie J & Toby Gad).<br /><br />\\"Stand Up\\" is a `B+' cut at best, but it works.  \\"I Need This,\\" the penultimate cut is a `B,' beginning to mark the `falloff' of the effort at the end.  \\"Who You Are\\" showcases the great nuances of Jessie's voice, cracks intact.  Unfortunately, like so many title tracks, it doesn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004K7HMJ6 Who You Are]] is a solid pop album.

1594744769|4.0|The creepy cover made me curious about this book when I first saw it but when I watched the trailer and it actually gave me chills I was convinced that I wanted to read it, I was definitely curious to find out more about these peculiar children and see all the photos inside this book. I was surprised to find out that it wasn't as creepy as I initially thought it would be but it had much more to it and the story just kept surprising me with twists along the way.<br /><br />After Jacob's grandfather dies his last words to Jacob send him off on a hunt to find out the truth about the school where his grandfather spent part of his childhood and about the children that he talked about often with Jacob. From then on the story takes off and becomes much more than just a creepy tale that gives you chills. The story turns into a bit of a mystery with a fascinating plot, we get to see Jacob find out more about his grandfather and his life in the house, and also find that the children were real, that they do have those supernatural abilities (some that were extremely creepy) and that they are still very much alive and unchanged but also hiding from something that is hunting them. The story behind that is a bit of a spoiler so I won't say how it was possible for them to still be there, you would have to read it to find out but I thought it was pretty unique twist to the story which made it a lot more interesting.<br /><br />Jacob was such a great character, his voice was very realistic for a teenage boy, he starts off being a bit of a brat with lots of attitude but begins to develop and change as the story goes along, he becomes someone braver and responsible.  I loved the addition of the pictures in the story, as it goes along the pictures represent a lot of what's going on and also some of the characters in the book and made the story feel much more real, which made me picture everything so much easier in my mind. There's also a bit of historical facts from World War II in the story intertwined with the fiction and made it a lot more chilling. The ending definitely left me curious to see where the story will go next, it gives you an idea of where it's heading but still leaves you wondering and definitely yearning to find out more. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children was engrossing from the start, everything was described with rich details and it had a pretty original concept with a great setting and lots of twists that will keep you thinking about it long after you finish it.ined with the fiction and made it a lot more chilling.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|i was lucky to grab this one on sale for 49.99 and id say its totally worth that price. They fit comfortably (and my head is pretty big lol) and i like the design. the sound quality and sterio balance is good when turned up HOWEVER because the cord only goes into the left side of the headset when the volume is turned low its obvious the sound isnt getting balanced correctly and the left side is a lot louder than the right... which can be irritating when you trying to carry a coverstion with someone in the room and game at the same time

B0050CQY1W|3.0|OK, so here it is...Beyonce's fourth studio album since going solo and if you thought the blas&eacute; title was indicative of her creativity eroding over time, judging by this CD, you'd be right. But first, lets get something straight: Beyonce does not write/compose her own songs. You know it. I know it. There's no point in pretending to judge the merits of an artistic endeavor (this album) when the 'artist' in question is just a glorified performer (Mrs. B). Michael Jackson she ain't. In light of this, I won't be reviewing Beyonce's work, all of us on Amazon (and elsewhere) are really reviewing her 'creative team' made up of writers, producers, etc. To be fair, the vast majority of mainstream artists today have become cash cows devoid of any creative/artistic input: the Jonas Brothers, Britney Spears, Fall Out Boy, Miley Cyrus, etc. The word 'writer' doesn't mean what it used to and today references copyright ownership as opposed to the individual who allegedly puts pen to paper.<br /><br />That said, just because Beyonce is a studio performer doesn't mean I can't take her for what she is, sit back, and enjoy the show. I own all of her previous solo releases as well. Some great and some not so great. 'I Am...Sasha Fierce', '4's predecessor, was (for me) a tremendous let down; a boring, monotonous bloat-fest featuring 18 tracks unnecessarily spread over two CD's. What was she thinking? That we would just snap up anything offered because a gimmicky alter ego (Chris Gaines anyone?) was being showcased? It certainly seemed that way.<br /><br />Which brings us to '4' a great chance to redeem herself and prove there's more to this performer than meets the eye. Yes, Bey has a great voice. Yes, 'I Am...Yours' proved she is an entertaining performer with charisma and stage presence (albeit ego). So what can Beyonce and her team forge, possibly rectifying that previous injustice of an album? In my opinion, not much. I gave three stars for what appears to be an average album; nothing more, nothing less. '4' is undoubtedly better than 'I Am...', but that's not saying much. I expected much better considering the far-reaching claim that Beyonce is creating her own genre of music, a claim heavily attached to this album in particular. Well, it's not hip hop that's for sure, nor is it  an exercise in experimentation (a similar claim). If anyone listens to '4' and hears something radically different that would warrant a claim of 'experimental', then that person has led a very cloistered life. It's an average album, neither helping nor harming her career/discography. Is it possible Beyonce has been left floundering in the wake of her own hype-machine?<br /><br />Overall, I've given '4' a good listen and the stand out tracks on this album all come from the second half. 'Love On Top' is a fun bouncy number reminiscent of a track from the early Michael Jackson era akin to 'Rock With You' including the semi-lifted lyric: \\"dance [rock] the night away\\". 'Countdown' is typical of her usual fare, but with a nice brass section chiming in occasionally; just good fun. The first 45 seconds of 'End of Time' is great, but as soon as the vocals kick in the track just becomes OK. Beyonce had me fooled with that one, I actually thought I was going to hear something innovative or, at the very least, outside of her comfort zone. For some reason 'Run the World (Girls)' ends up being the final track on the album which I feel belies the whole atmosphere the album seemed to build: somber, soulful ballads shifting precariously into euphoric celebration of true love only to be suddenly interrupted by a disjointed power anthem; otherwise, that track has really grown on me due in large part to the sampled Major Lazer drum rhythm. The video, however, has sunk my opinion of the song since it appears Beyonce resorts to the same-old/same-old 'sex sells' gimmick masquerading as feminism. Women run the world and yet we still dress like Bellagio cocktail waitresses? Huh? And don't get me started on the warped weirdness war she seems to have entered with Lady Gaga...lions and hyenas and riot police, oh my! Anyway, I absolutely hate '1+1', the sickly sweet ballad I'm convinced Beyonce is contractually obligated to add to every album since becoming a solo artist. I really could have done without it. All of the songs on this album feature dull lyrics lacking intellectual or emotional depth. An example: 'Best Thing I Never Had' croons \\"I bet it sucks to be you right now...\\" and \\"You showed your ass and I saw the real you\\", ugh. 'Party' featuring Andre 3000 should have been a lot better, but I was sorely disappointed by that track and this is coming from an Outkast fan. The rest of the tracks are just plain forgettable, but don't take my word for it (it's a short listen at 45 minutes) you'll blow right through it and come to your own conclusions.<br /><br />Ultimately, I don't believe there was a way for Bey to prevent her next album from being completely enveloped by the dreaded 'hype'. Beyonce's publicist and other PR people in her camp need to give it a rest. According to '4', Bey's not as great as she, you, or I think she is: she's no Diana Ross, she's no Michael Jackson, and no amount of televised montages touting her 'contributions' to the music industry will change that.arped weirdness war she seems to have entered with Lady Gaga...lions and hyenas and riot police, oh my!

B003GEDLW6|5.0|I'll admit I was a bit apprehensive about getting into these guys from the get go. I am not an electronica person at all, and I had only heard one DnB band, which is Canada's Indie/DnB act U.S.S. What drew me into U. S. S.' sound was the catchy two step beat, in fact that may be what made their music so damn catchy and listenable in the first place. I had mentioned it in a conversation with a buddy of mine, and this is where he mentioned that the two step rythym is very typical DnB stuff, similar to Pendulum. Now I thought the name was interesting but I had my doubts, but I consider myself to be an open minded person. So I searched up a song of theirs on YouTube, and came across a catchy tune called \\"Propane Nightmares\\". I was hooked. After a bit of further research I found out they opened for my favorite band, Iron Maiden. That just left me with no choice but to buy a CD of theirs.<br /><br />So the week after I went to HMV while waiting for my girlfriend to go see Hangover II, and I was searching for Pendulum in the store, specifically In Silico, which has the above mentioned Popane Nightmares. There weren't any copies, but there were just 2 copies of Immersion sitting there, the one in front hypothetically desperately on it's knees begging for me to buy it. Needless to say, I obeyed it's begs.<br /><br />Honestly, I haven't been this surprised by an album purchase in a long time. The moment it began, I was hooked. Not a single song on this album can be labeled \\"weak\\" or \\"filler\\".<br /><br />Genesis is a short instrumental that gets us offmto a grand start. It has a bit of a Star Wars epic march feel to it, and it sets the tone perfectly: 2000mph DnB delivered to your ears in the most pleasant way.<br /><br />Then Salt in the Wounds came, and I will admit. Was a bit taken aback. Two instrumentals to start a CD. odd. I was gob smacked when I first heard the song. I hadn't heard ANYTHING like that before. Honestly, who is creative enough to come up with such a sick beat, such killer and heavy synth riffs, so many twists and turns I can't see coming? For six minutes I just sat there in wonder, amazed at what I was hearing. Guys, this is INTENSE music. This is the second song I listen to every morning. It gets me all energized.<br /><br />Rob Swire has a chilling voice. It is so crisp, pure and strong. When Watercolour came, I was so surprised at how eerie and beautiful his voice sounded. Watercolour is a touching and energetic number with great lyrics and amazing music. One of the best tracks in years.<br /><br />There is something for everybody in this album, no matter what their tastes may be defined as. Crush is a catchy Muse-esque number that is consistently fun to listen to, I can imagine it being a great singalong tune at a concert. Under the Waves can only be described as \\"Iron Maiden doing electro rock\\" with the twin synths and what not. The two parter The Island makes for a truly different experience. I love the second part especially, with all the sick scratches and synth effects... That was AWESOME! Immunize is fun for a catchy dance tune.<br /><br />Ben Mount, popular English rapper and The bands concert MC, makes an appearance on The Vulture, and it RULES! His appearance alone makes it the best track on the album for me. I can imagine myself at a Pendulum concert losing my voice shouting the words of the song. It also doesn't surprise me that he has a hell of a lot of energy on stage. I consider him to be the rap equivalent of Bruce Dickinson... he even looks like Bruce Dickinson too!<br /><br />And how awesome is a consistent final four tracks. The edgy electro rocker Witchcraft sends shivers down my Spine every time I hear it. Honestly it's just powerful. I especially love the heavy reprise of the chorus near the end. Self Vs Self is a great duet with In Flames and it just fits so well! Anders and Rob have such perfect chemistry. Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree appears on The Fountain, an interesting little dittythat reminds you a lot of latter day Rush. The final track Encoder is a very cool tribal track in the first half, then becomes a U2-esque tune to finish the album.... It's a total ear worm. I won't lie it was in my head dreams he first night I heard it. I was also gob smacked by the rather creepy ending to the tune with the water sounds and breathing then the wham noise.<br /><br />In short, while not quite The Final Frontier, this is one of the best albums I've ever heard! I guarantee you it is so addicting. Even if you're like me and dislike electronica, this album is one hot package. Buy it now!!!!!! Essential listening, people!!!!!!!der is a very cool tribal track in the first half, then becomes a U2-esque tune to finish the album.... It's a total ear worm.

B002LMOCJ0|5.0|I know a lot of you are thinking \\"hey! Wasn't this movie grainy and kinda bad looking on dvd!\\", but even though the HD does not add to the visual clarity, it does better represent the original look of the film. The Clerks X dvd masked many of the flaws in the 16mm film format with digital compression artifacts, but the bluray shows the film as it really was, \\"warts and all\\".        Oh Yeah!       Its a funny movie too!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|After listening to this album several times,reading reviews and making some comments I decided to express some thoughts about this album and why I like it.First I am a long time Yes fan going back to the 70's.The albums made in that decade are my favorite.I never much liked Drama very much so after many have said this sounds like Drama 2 I thought I would listen to Drama again.What I learned is I still do not like it much in comparison to this album.The songs on this album are so much better.The key for me is also the singer.Benoit David is a much better singer in my opinion than Trevor Horn and that makes the difference for me.Don't get me wrong I like Jon Anderson but Benoit's voice is quite strong and pleasant to listen to.On this album the songwriting is good,vocals are strong and the musicianship is excellent.A great progressive rock album in my opinion from the band called Yes.The epic song \\"We Can Fly\\" is worth the price by itself.The is why I became a Yes fan in the first place.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|Limitless (thriller, mystery, sci-fi)<br />Directed by Neil Burger<br />Starring Bradley Cooper, Robert De Niro and Abbie Cornish<br /><br />20th Century Fox   2011   105 min   Rated PG-13   Released Jul 19, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />Single Blu-ray Disc<br />Digital copy<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />Eddie Morra (Cooper) is a loser. He looks like he sleeps on the streets and his girlfriend is his main source of income while he struggles to write a novel. He lives in a seedy apartment and is more likely to be eating pizza and drinking alcohol than working on his book. His girlfriend (Cornish) finally decides it's time to leave, but Eddie's life is about to change for the better.<br /><br />In a chance meeting with Vernon, the brother of his ex-wife, Eddie is offered a pill. He's suspicious because Vernon was dealing drugs the last time the two met. After thinking about it, Eddie decides that life can't get much worse and takes the pill. Within 30 seconds, he starts to feel different. The color palette changes from dull and muted to bright and clear and represents the change in Eddie.<br /><br />We are told that we use a fraction of our brain on a daily basis. The pill is supposed to enable us to use one hundred percent of our brain. Eddie finds that he can think clearly and work out solutions to difficult problems. He writes a book in four days without pausing to think how the plot should progress and his editor loves the result. We see him learn how to play piano and become fluent in the Italian language.<br /><br />Eddie feels like he suddenly knows everything.<br /><br />It's interesting how a positive mental attitude can change your life. Instead of living like a slob, he cleans his apartment. Then he focuses on ways to use his intelligence to make enough money to permanently change his life. His new confident attitude attracts the girlfriend who dumped him. Eddie's life is starting to look pretty good.<br /><br />After making the news with a series of shrewd investments, Eddie attracts the attention of Carl Van Loon (De Niro). Van Loon is an ambitious businessman who craves money and power. He has no time to waste on losers, but gives Eddie a chance to impress. He reminds me of Gordon Gekko in Wall Street.<br /><br />Eddie's main problem is securing a regular supply of pills. He also has to adapt to their effects and discover a way to moderate his reaction. Like any drug, there are side effects to deal with. I won't reveal anything else, but the plot is more complicated than I have made it sound.<br /><br />The movie is advertised as an action thriller and Rolling Stone describes it as a \\"Full-tilt adrenalin rush.\\" Although there some action scenes, I wouldn't describe it as an adrenalin rush. There are chase scenes, but the focus is on Eddie's fortunes and there's always an element of mystery. I found it enjoyable because I wanted to see what would happen next, but I rarely found myself sitting on the edge of my seat in anticipation.<br /><br />The acting is good across the board. Cooper pulls off his role well. He's serious when he has to be and whimsical in the lighter scenes. De Niro doesn't get a great deal of screen time, but his scenes are memorable. Cornish is effective as Eddie's girlfriend.<br /><br />I found Limitless to be an enjoyable way to spend 105 minutes. There are two versions included on the Blu-ray; the theatrical and the unrated extended version. There is only a few seconds difference in running time between the two.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />Limitless looks very good on Blu-ray. Detail is strong throughout, although we see more during scenes where Eddie is feeling the effects of the drug. Contrast and brightness are boosted during such scenes.Although the other scenes appear drab by comparison, there's good detail and no problem with the transfer. Most viewers will be pleased with the look of the movie.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is more than adequate. The action scenes are limited, but the track delivers when needed. Dialogue is crisp and clear and I didn't detect any problems with the sound.

Cooper does a great job as Eddie and you'll want to see him succeed. It's hard to pin down the genre as it includes mystery, drama, action, sci-fi and comedy, but it's more of a thriller than anything. I didn't see the film in the theater, but I'm glad it found its way into my Blu-ray collection.

0061714372|5.0|I've always been fascinated by Dave Mustaine, both the musician and the character. In this book you'll find (almost) everything you ever wanted to know about the ups and down of his life and musical career - with no shortage of gory, decadent details. If you believe in destiny, in a higher plan, then Mustaine was meant to do great things and suffer miserably in the process.    This is a man  that got over spiraling drug abuse, marital problems, band conflicts, career-threatening injuries, ... you name it. It's nothing short of miraculous that, in the face of all these recurrent issue, Dave still kept producing immortal music and playing to thousands of fans worldwide. Simply put, the guy's a genius. He was a wreck for a good part of his life, he turned to God (yes, the renegade Jehovah's witness versed in black magic), and now he's just a man. No small feat.     When you look at Dave now onstage and you see him thanking the audience from the bottom of his heart for turning up for the show, you could say the guy's gone soft. Still, his latest record Endgame features blistering thrash metal loaded with unpleasant lyrics such as Headcrusher, a composition that could date back, in anger and ferocity, to his most intoxicated years. \\"The rage of the holy man\\", that's Dave for you today.    The book dissipates some of my questions through the years, like why couldn't the Rust in Piece lineup reunite, or why Junior wasn't in the lineup when Dave recovered from this arm injury. Damn it, I always though it was a hoax to make a big reunion. Would you really believe he ruined his fret-dancing hand sleeping in bad position? The guy that had done reckless driving, got into fights in alleyways, scored booze, smack, and heroin all together, and gulped several dozen valiums straight? But that is what happened, apparently. Talk about the reckoning day, if you may.    From all the challenges that Dave has had to face (and he's very candid to share them all, no matter how embarrassing)there is one which still haunts him, not fully, but to some degree, as he admits in the last chapter of the book: Metallica. From the moment he was unceremoniously kicked - without warning - from Metallica, he was a broken man.     Very aptly, while reading this book, I went to the Big 4 show in Milan, Italy. Over the years I've become more of a Megadeth fan than a Metallica fan. I had seen Megadeth live 3 times before this show, every time duly impressed (or shall I say rocked to my feet!). What can I say? Dave shreds and the songs are anthems. As for Metallica, this was my first live show (in due time!). I gotta say that James&co. blew me away beyond my wildest expectations.  The stage presence, the charisma of the band and the classic setlist are just jaw dropping. Megadeth felt like Mustaine (a highly talented musician and songwriter) with a bunch of highly professional companions. Metallica felt like a powerhouse of a band. And I can fully understand now how this feeling of being only second best has plagued Mustaine's life, and still does to some degree (Lars shenanigans not helping in the process!).      All in all, this is a must read for any Megadeth fan and a very entertaining and thought provoking book for anyone fascinated by the rock and roll lifestyle. Five stars all the way. Kudos to Dave \\"the genius\\" Mustaine.
B001152TL6|5.0|Lost Highway (drama, mystery, thriller)<br />Directed by David Lynch<br />Starring Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette, Balthazar Getty and Robert Loggia<br /><br />Concorde Video   1997   135 min   Rated FSK-16   Released May 05, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />German: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />German (optional)<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />This review refers to the German Blu-ray version.<br /><br />***Spoilers within***<br /><br />The Film 4.5/5<br /><br />The DVD release from Universal Studios claims a 2 hour 25 minute running time, but that's actually a printing error. Both that and this Blu-ray version clock in at 2 hours 15 minutes. All of the original DVD scenes are intact.<br /><br />David Lynch is my favorite director, although Quentin Tarantino isn't far behind. Lynch appeals so much because his films create worlds with a distinct feel. He's very precise and chooses the exact sound or image needed to complete his vision. When I watch Mulholland Dr. or Blue Velvet, my normal world ceases to exist; it's pure escapism. For that reason, I chose to import Lost Highway from Germany. Who knows when we'll see a North American release?<br /><br />All of Lynch's films are challenging. He rarely uses a linear plot structure and the line between what is real and what is imagined is usually blurred. Lost Highway is one of the most difficult films to interpret, but it can still be enjoyed even if you don't fully understand everything on the screen.<br /><br />The film opens with the image of a road. We're traveling down it at night to the sound of David Bowie's I'm Deranged. This was not a frivolous choice and is a major hint at what you can expect to follow. This is a film about madness. In fact, I believe it is a look inside the mind of a killer. Think about how difficult that is to achieve.<br /><br />There are thousands of films about killers, but how many of them show the true motivation for murder? Lost Highway hints at motivation and gives an idea of how such a person might think. That's one reason why the plot is such a mess. Insane thoughts wouldn't always follow a logical pattern.<br /><br />We see a glimpse of how Fred (Pullman) and Renee (Arquette) Madison live. He's a musician and fears that his wife is being unfaithful. He wants to go out, but she prefers to stay home. When he calls, she doesn't answer and his suspicion grows. The next morning, she discovers a yellow envelope outside the front door. There's no address or note, but it contains a video showing the outside of the house. Another envelope shows up the following day and this time it shows Fred and Renee asleep in bed. The police are called in, but don't discover anything out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Fred tells the police that they don't own a video camera. In fact, he hates them because he likes to remember things his own way rather than how they happened. That's another clue that we can't rely on anything shown from Fred's viewpoint.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes happens early in the story. Fred and Renee go to a party and Fred talks to a weird looking man. The man informs him that they previously met at Fred's house and that he's there right now. That sounds crazy, but the man gives Fred a phone and tells him to call him at the house. The man appears to answer. He says that Fred invited him and he never goes where he's not wanted. As it's impossible to be in two places at once, this clearly represents something else. I think the man represents Fred's emotions. He's suspicious, jealous and angry.<br /><br />A third tape shows Fred standing over Renee's corpse. Remember that he hates video cameras because they show what happened? I think Lynch is saying that what happens on video is Fred's reality and everything else is unreliable. There's further proof of this when Fred is arrested for the murder of his wife.<br /><br />All of these events occur in the first 40 minutes of the film. From that point on, things start to get really weird. If I were to analyze every scene it would ruin the film if you haven't seen it, so I'll stop there. All I can say is that events take a dramatic turn and initially seem impossible. But the more you think about it, the more it makes sense.<br /><br />Mulholland Dr. also deals with identity and blurred reality. The two films are similar in feel in many ways. We see actors playing dual roles and we are not always sure whether any events are real. The film works as a collection of interesting scenes, but it's even more effective when you realize what is being portrayed. I won't pretend to understand everything and I am not sure I am supposed to.<br /><br />The choice of music perfectly matches the mood. We hear from Rammstein, Trent Reznor, Marilyn Manson, Lou Reed, This Mortal Coil, and many others. The whole thing is held together by Angelo Badalamenti's haunting score.<br /><br />The acting is very good. Pullman pulls off Fred's nervous demeanor perfectly and Arquette is suitably mysterious. I particularly liked Robert Loggia's performance and he oozed menace every time he was on the screen. Robert Blake as the Mystery Man sent shivers down my spine and he didn't always seem human. As well as a cameo from Marilyn Manson, watch out for a glimpse of Henry Rollins as a prison guard.<br /><br />I enjoy all of Lynch's films. While Lost Highway doesn't quite hit the heights of Mulholland Dr. and Blue Velvet, it's still among my Top 25 from any genre. It won't appeal to everyone, but if you enjoy experiencing unsettling worlds, this might work for you too.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />The DVD looks soft and I wasn't expecting Lost Highway to look very good on Blu-ray, but I was in for a surprise. Concorde Video has produced a wonderful transfer. Detail is exceptional for most of the film and I didn't detect any print damage or dirt. There were a few very infrequent white speckles, but I'm thrilled with the look of the Blu-ray. I can't imagine any future releases looking any better. The film is region free, but the special features are PAL. So you can watch the film in all its glory, but you won't have an image during the special features unless you use a region B or region free player. For the record, the Blu-ray includes chapters.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5<br />The Blu-ray defaults to German: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 so you'll need to use the pop up menu to change to English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. It's a great track and displays the atmospheric scenes very well. This is a lively soundtrack, but the quieter scenes also benefit. The overall presentation is excellent. German subtitles are optional rather than forced.<br /><br />Special Features 1/5<br /><br />The PAL special features appear in standard definition.

It won't appeal to everyone, but hopefully my review will help you decide whether it's for you. It's one of the best titles I have added in 2011.<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5hen Fred is arrested for the murder of his wife.<br /><br />All of these events occur in the first 40 minutes of the film. From that point on, things start to get really weird. If I were to analyze every scene it would ruin the film if you haven't seen it, so I'll stop there. All I can say is that events take a dramatic turn and initially seem impossible. But the more you think about it, the more it makes sense.<br /><br />Mulholland Dr. also deals with identity and blurred reality. The two films are similar in feel in many ways. We see actors playing dual roles and we are not always sure whether any events are real. The film works as a collection of interesting scenes, but it's even more effective when you realize what is being portrayed. I won't pretend to understand everything and I am not sure I am supposed to.<br /><br />The choice of music perfectly matches the mood. We hear from Rammstein, Trent Reznor, Marilyn Manson, Lou Reed, This Mortal Coil, and many others. The whole thing is held together by Angelo Badalamenti's haunting score.<br /><br />The acting is very good. Pullman pulls off Fred's nervous demeanor perfectly and Arquette is suitably mysterious. I particularly liked Robert Loggia's performance and he oozed menace every time he was on the screen. Robert Blake as the Mystery Man sent shivers down my spine and he didn't always seem human. As well as a cameo from Marilyn Manson, watch out for a glimpse of Henry Rollins as a prison guard.<br /><br />I enjoy all of Lynch's films. While Lost Highway doesn't quite hit the heights of Mulholland Dr. and Blue Velvet, it's still among my Top 25 from any genre. It won't appeal to everyone, but if you enjoy experiencing unsettling worlds, this might work for you too.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />The DVD looks soft and I wasn't expecting Lost Highway to look very good on Blu-ray, but I was in for a surprise. Concorde Video has produced a wonderful transfer. Detail is exceptional for most of the film and Ididn't detect any print damage or dirt. There were a few very infrequent white speckles, but I'm thrilled with the look of the Blu-ray. I can't imagine any future releases looking any better. The film is region free, but the special features are PAL. So you can watch the film in all its glory, but you won't have an image during the special features unless you use a region B or region free player. For the record, the Blu-ray includes chapters.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5<br />The Blu-ray defaults to German: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 so you'll need to use the pop up menu to change to English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. It's a great track and displays the atmospheric scenes very well. This is a lively soundtrack, but the quieter scenes also benefit. The overall presentation is excellent. German subtitles are optional rather than forced.<br /><br />Special Features 1/5<br /><br />The PAL special features appear in standard definition.

B000Z0OX9O|5.0|The CD1 is a reedition of Vangelis's 1994 OST. The CD2 is a precious addition to the pack. It includes unreleased, yet familiar film cue's, for all Blade Runner fans. Its a pure dive into Blade Runner's world and feelings. CD3 is Vangelis's most recent tribute to Blade Runner's legacy. It is an interesting revisitation and Vangelis's personal reinterpretation of what Los Angeles 2019 (and beyond) could also be. It extrapolates the films boundaries. Strange at first but after a few hearings it begins to fit in the trilogy very smoothly.    João Ramos, Portugal
B004K4IZ54|4.0|First off, I just want to say that This movie is a \\"MUST-HAVE\\" on blu-ray.  DVD format doesn't do it justice.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan.      The only reason I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars is because the 3D version requires a $1,500 1080P 3D HDTV and 3D-enabled blu-ray/PS3 in order to view it.  It isn't like regular 3D versions which u can play on a normal Blu-Ray player with included glasses.  Now I will admit that it is my fault for not reading the disclaimer which clearly states these requirements,  but it would have been nice to include a regular 3D version for those of us unwilling or unable to fork out the money for a 3D TV.    But all in all, I am satisfied with my purchase.  And the regular 3D version looks SPECTACULAR!!!
0345528581|5.0|Awesome book, extremely well written. Best chapter was (surprisingly) the one on nutrition, it makes a huge difference following his dietary guidelines. Feel much better, more energy. The workouts are short but tough. First time i did leg workout could not walk right or sit down easily for the next few days. This is not a get skinny and jacked in one week, but if you follow his program you will definitely see amazing results in a few weeks. This book helped me gain considerable strength and get cut in a few weeks. He also dispels some myths about exercising, basically why cardio is not as effective as strength training. Great book. 5 stars.
B004U8VQOW|1.0|Obviously this is not your hollywood movie or tv show its a documentary & one of the dullest I've seen. There's a few beautiful shots of space but over all its dull and like hubble overrated. Somethings are better left to nature & you can only walk into a wall or run into one so many times before your head hurts. For some kids it may be the inspiration they need and stir their wonder & amazement in bringing back exploration & the desire for what ifs. Maybe it'll help the future reach even more incredible goals but for the rest its better then nursey rymhes. Skip it.
B001IF252M|2.0|This product is does not work well with certain cables, so be warned.     I host a lot of presentations, in many diffrent places, so i must hook up with all kinds of projectors and setups. I can tell you this adapter isn't compatible in some cases because of its design. It's not a hardware issue, it's more of an issue with its build. The way the socket is cased into the adapter makes it so the pins in the projector's cable won't make it all the way in for some cases. I end up having to either dissassemble the projectors socket to gain an extra 1/4cm for the pins, or having to use a vga splitter. Mind you, that dissassembling a socket prior to a presentation is pretty frustrating and disarming.    So be warned, you just might have to get an adapter, for your adapter :S    However, whenever it does work, it does so wonderfully.

1451629184|5.0|I wasn't sure that I wanted to read this book but so glad I did. She endures so much but her outlook is amazing. I don't know that I could have survived all that. I purchased the book at noon and had it read cover to cover by dinner time. I couldn't put it down. I was amazed to find out that one of her journal entries read that she wanted to be on the Best Seller List one day. I am so happy for her bravery and she seems like such an amazing mother. I do wonder how she would have made out living with her step-father though...either way it seemed like she would have suffered. Although her experience was far worse than anything else could have been. It is so sad but you can see how smart she is and how focused on her future she was. I wish her the best. I do hope we hear more about her relationship with her mom and sister.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|The previews made this look pretty cool.  There are so few action heroes that are women, that that alone made me want to see this.  But the movie itself was a horrible disappointment.      A common problem with some movies is that they start at 1000 miles per hour, leaving them no where to go, nothing to increase the tension.  So, the plot & the intensity just flatlines through the whole movie.      The stylized fight sequences which looked incredible on the previews, went on WAY too long.  The sequences / settings, seemed to have no connection to the movie or to the fight scenes.  They were just random scenes that I assume, someone just thought they looked cool      And the ending...without spoiling it......was a total let down.
0553801473|3.0|In \\"A Dance with Dragons,\\" George R.R. Martin seems to have ripped out a page from his own self-written guide to writing a good story, and replaced it with a page from Robert Jordan's version - and in both cases, the change was very much for the worse.<br /><br />The page he borrowed could charitably be called \\"Setup,\\" or \\"Preparation,\\" or even given some grandiose description about the \\"careful movement and positioning of critical pieces on a game board.\\"  In practical terms, though, it comes down to \\"Delay,\\" \\"Pointless Stalling,\\" and would be more accurately summed up as \\"an entire book about multiple characters wandering slowly across the world to approach - but never reach - a place in which something interesting has the potential to happen.\\"  For example, everyone's favourite dwarf has a simple goal: he wants to throw in his lot with the dragon queen, offering her whatever advice and wisdom he can.  A noble goal, that, and one that would do a great deal to move the story along - his cynicism would open her eyes about some pretty important things.  But does he make it to her?  Not in this book!  No, he's far too busy being packed into barrels like Bilbo the hobbit, swapping tales with cheese lords, being lost, found, sold, and bought, falling in with slaves and signing paper for sellswords, and even being saddled with a plucky lady-dwarf sidekick who continually tells him that he should stop causing trouble and just focus on making the big people laugh, because that's what dwarves are for.  In Westeros during the previous four books, he was known and feared as Tyrion of House Lannister, Halfman to the wild mountain tribes, former Hand of the King, unsung hero of Blackwater Bay, the Imp, kinslayer and Kingslayer both; in Essos during this book, all he really manages to do is play a lot of Stratego, reminisce about a previously-unmentioned happy boyhood of gymnastics training in the art of dwarfish capering, and fall convincingly off a trained pig.<br /><br />Thesame song is sung throughout the book: nobody actually *gets* anywhere.  In Meereen, Daenerys mopes, sighs, tosses her braids, and moons over a pretty boy.  On the Wall, Jon Snow hems, haws, asks everyone within earshot for advice on what to do, then completely ignores all of the advice to do something entirely different while complaining about how nobody supports him.  Stannis grits his teeth, Melisandre misinterprets prophecies, Dolorous Edd makes comments about mules.  A new character is introduced who represents either the most vibrantly crimson scarlet of red herrings, or George R.R. Martin on waterskis leaping majestically over a great white shark; the jury's still out on the kid, but it *is* safe to say that he spends half the book marching determinedly in one direction before abruptly turning around and charging off on completely the opposite course.<br /><br />And then, there's the issue of the page missing from this book, the page that had elevated the first three books so high above the likes of Goodkind or Jordan.  It's the page called \\"Caprice,\\" or \\"Injustice,\\" or maybe \\"Nobody is Safe.\\"  It's the page on which he knowingly and thoroughly subverted the standard fantasy tropes of good triumphing over evil, of all death being either deserved (if the deceased was a bad guy, like for instance an orc) or deeply meaningful (a sacrifice, like Boromir dying to protect the hobbits).  The previous books used that page, and used it well.  No character was sacred: anyone could die at any time, for any reason - or for no reason at all - because the world was a cruel and merciless and fickle place, and justice and honor and fair treatment were exceptions rather than rules.<br /><br />In \\"A Dance with Dragons,\\" though - and in \\"A Feast for Crows,\\" to an extent - that page is notably absent.  The Onion Knight, by this point, has gone through more lives than the average cat; while I have great fondness for the character, I almost wish Martin *would* kill him off just sothe poor soul could rest.  Whenever Arya gets a knife pressed against her throat, it turns out to be a well-meaning rescuer offering her a haircut.  Mance dies then reappears good as new, Catelyn died and reappeared (somewhat the worse for wear, in her case), ghosts from the past pop up alive and well and living in the Westerosi equivalent of Paris.  At this point, I'm more than half-expecting Khal Drogo to ride up on a skeletal horse and say \\"Hey Dany babe, I busted out of the nightlands, let's cross the poison water before my afterlife parole officer finds out I'm here.\\"  A Song of Ice and Fire has gone from \\"Nobody is Safe\\" to \\"Every Main Character is Totally Safe at this Point,\\" and the suspense is just *gone*.<br /><br />So, after all that, do I regret reading \\"A Dance with Dragons\\"?  No.  The sad truth is, even a mediocre George R.R. Martin book is better than most of the other offerings in the genre.  My thoughtful boyfriend bought it for me on iBooks the very hour it was released, and I'm sincerely grateful that he did, and I'll buy and enjoy the next one just as promptly.<br /><br />But even though this book was good enough, it can't help but suffer by comparison to the others.  On its own merits, I rated \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" 3/5 stars; compared to the magnificence of the first three, though, it's more like a 1.5/5.
0553801473|3.0|Edited: 3/20/2013 (I re-read the book, wanting to give it another chance after watching the very well done television series, but my feelings generally remain the same with some new insights)<br /><br />Warning: I do not give specific story spoilers, but some of my comments can be considered spoilers to the structure of the story.<br /><br />So, to lighten the blow a little first, I will make it clear that I am a fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series. Like many others, I think the first three books were some of the best fantasy books in recent history. They held my interest like few others, took directions many other writers would not dare to take and had me itching to read the next. I'm a fan who checked on the status of this book at least a couple dozen times through each year to see how the progress was coming and I'm a fan who also believes in a writer taking the time he or she needs to do it properly. While I honestly was a little impatient to read the next book (which is a good thing, unless you're attacking the author over it), I could not fault someone for wanting to do other things with their lives.<br /><br />As far as the positives for A Dance with Dragons specifically, Martin continues to show a strong and addicting narrative style with a great attention to detail without going too overboard most of the time. His use of language remains strong with some good character insights and quotes derived from it, and there are a number of moments in the book that were intriguing. These are the reasons why I gave it three stars and if a lesser writer had authored the book, I probably would have never finished it.<br /><br />And before I go into my criticisms of the book, there is something I would like to note. While I often take the side of artists in artistic work, we have to be honest in realizing that the book series is also a commodity. It is not something just written for artistic purposes. When something is put on the market for sale, it is subject to thescrutiny of its consumers.<br /><br />That said, A Dance with Dragons (and A Feast for Crows) bored me in comparison to the first three books, and while I would like to read how the story ends, I am hesitant to invest more time and money into the book series. I may just be a customer, reader, and fan, so what would I know about editing, story-building, etc., and GRRM may be the professional writer and it went through professional editors, but they still made a cardinal writing error that I so often hear you should not make:<br /><br />They did not keep the story moving. By the end of the book, I felt almost nothing happened.<br /><br />I believe at this point in a book series' life, the story needs to be picking up faster and faster. You need down times of course, and a little exposition in each book to get everyone up to speed again is a good thing...but not through the majority of the book. Things need to happen and you need to have control of the story.<br /><br />I'll give an example. Say you saw a fight at work and you are telling someone about it. You would probably give them a lead up and let them know it was at work between two employees who were not getting along recently, you would probably give them background information like the significant other of one of the employees was cheating with the other employee. You may talk about how another employee that was friends with both revealed that information and hence, betrayed one of those friends. Then, you would describe the fight and its aftermath.<br /><br />What you would probably not talk about is how you stubbed your toe on the way to the car to get to work, the more scenic route that you happened to take that morning, or what you ate at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, or describe in exhausting detail your work duties leading up to the point of the fight. No one cares about these details and you are slowing the story down to a crawl. And say you do all this, even talk about the events related to the actual fight, then you do not actually get to the fight and say, \\"I'll tell you about the fight next time.\\"<br /><br />Now, imagine that fight being told by seventeen other people, including people who are near irrelevant to the story. This is what A Dance with Dragons felt like to me. The drawn out version of a story with a poorly handled cliffhanger.<br /><br />I really feel that Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons are books that maybe shouldn't have been written or at the very least, heavily edited. I could even say that they could have been condensed into one book between 500-700 pages axed between the two of them (and still have time to put in events that could have made them better). I understand that the author originally planned a time skip by five years after Storm of Swords and honestly, I felt that would have been better. Between the two books, I just felt very little moved forward in terms of the actual story and they could have easily been left out without hurting the overall story.<br /><br />Of course, there will be many people (probably the majority) disagreeing with me and that is their full right to do so. We're all entitled to our opinions. If you loved Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons or just love to soak up everything you can from the story's world, then that's awesome. If you felt you got your money's and time's worth, then that is great. I wish I could have enjoyed them as much as you. I really do.<br /><br />But I didn't.<br /><br />On that note, I hope that The Winds of Winter will be a return to form for Martin's writing. However, after the last two books, I know better than to purchase it on day one, and depending on the feedback it gets, I may opt to not purchase it at all and check it out from a library, instead. And I am not entirely sure I will even do that, I'm sad to say.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|This movie is really captivating. It takes you on Elizabeth's journey through life. She is a young girl born into a family of five daughters. Her fanatic mother wants them all married because if their father dies they would have nothing. This is because in this time period females can't inherit. The setting is set in an older time period. This tale will surely touch your heart. I'm not one for crying while watching movies but this one makes me cry every time I watch it. This is truely a great movie that no other romance can stand up to.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|John Locke assures us that this is how he achieved success in the ebook publishing market. Well the stats speak for themselves, so I was sold straight away. John openly admits that there are better writers on the market - see what he did there? I joined his club immediately. But John knows how to tell a good story, more importantly he knows where to find his audience, round them up and point them in the right direction. There is no hard sell. Just a mutual building of friendship and respect between author and reader. I read some reviews of this book before I purchased, and note some say oh, yeah well obvious when you think about it. But John's already thought about it - and he lays it all out here for you to follow. Half way through this book I stopped and downloaded one of his ebooks. I could see exactly what he was talking about. It's not in my best interest to encourage other authors to buy this book and learn from the master, but what else could I do when this advice is so good? I actually feel indebted. Thank you Mr. Locke from your newest fan.
4789009637|4.0|I could go on for a long time about all the good things about Genki, but as there are plenty of reviewers doing that already, I will instead focus on the few things that bothered me instead.     1. The wording can be unnecessarily complex or wordy. Here's an example: \\"the idea of past tense is encoded differently in the affirmative and negative polarities\\". This is explaining that Adjectives conjugate differently depending on whether the statement is positive or negative. Now, the way it's phrased make sense, but it seems they sacrificed the ease of use in order to make the wording more concise. Not a huge issue, but when you have to read the English multiple times while trying to learn another language, it can be quite difficult.    2. I noticed a few omissions that though not absolutely necessary for learning the language, would have been very useful. Another example from the same chapter is when addressing the negative forms of \\"-i\\" adjectives, they use \\"-kuarimasen\\" form. Now this is grammatically correct. But using it in speech is kind of like trying to speak the same way one writes in English. It is very formal, and in most situations would sound awkward. \\"-kunai\\" would be much more commonly used. However, there is no mention of the \\"-kunai\\" form except in a footnote as an option, and if one were to base their Japanese on this textbook, there would be many situations like this, where conversational Japanese is left out or passed over quickly. This is of course a major issue if you want to be able to speak the language, as it's like not being able to say \\"was\\", instead replacing it with \\"at an earlier point in time\\". They both make sense, but one seems very odd to say, and not knowing what \\"was\\" is is kind of weird.     Otherwise, the book is great. Though less vocabulary oriented than Minna No Nihongo, it has the advantage of not needing to jump from book to book figuring things out, and it's grammatical explanations (other than the one issue above) are very well put together and simple to study. It also helps that the grammar explanations are subdivided in the chapters, meaning that for those with little time it's easy to just study a part of the lesson at a time.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I've read this book so often, I can actually quote word for word. Within the first few pages you forget which century you're in, and really feel for Elizabeth and Jane as their sisters and mother embarrass them in society. You feel poor Darcy's bemusement at falling in love with someone from a (perceived) lower class, and you ache for Lizzie to unbend a little and cut the guy some slack. When they finally get it on, I breathe a huge sigh of relief that everything's turned out so wonderfully. Yes, even though I must have read it over a hundred times. And that's timeless fiction.

0307716511|4.0|Rosamund Lupton is a lovely first time novelist. When her sister Tess goes missing, Beatrice arrives in London from New York hell bent on finding her, which quickly turns to something much more horrifying, when her body is found in a park restroom, the apparent victim of suicide. Beatrice in a haunting, aching prose begins to recount to her sibling how she unequivocally believes her sister was actually murdered, and the steps she's taking to solve the crime. Much should be said about Lupton's beautiful and at times breathlessly sad writing, and her melding of past and present create a tense and page  turning read. I would say my one complaint about the book comes not so much from the content but the promotion of the book. Like watching a movie trailer that gives away the entire plot of the film, promotional blurbs for the book have tipped a critical spoiler, so that I personally as I approached the finish line, saw the ending telegraphed and was somewhat disappointed. To say more would do the exact thing that has me so annoyed. Suffice to say, it ended as I thought it was going to, and that ending wasn't necessarily what I wanted either creatively or structurally. But had I known nothing about the book, I think I would've been at least a bit more along for the ride, instead of bracing for the inevitable crash.

B004AHNIGM|3.0|In 1978, a dockworker friend, friend of the herb, used to roam around the Pocono break-bulk dock, singing Allman Brothers band songs.  Driving a tow-motor at high speed, Steve would place his tongue behind the bottom lip, and belt-out \\"These Days.\\"  Man..., who does that song? I asked and have been a huge fan of Greg Allman's anti-American Idol voice eversince -- especially \\"Laid Back\\" an album which was interestingly noted on Patti Hearst's favorite album list.  And despite the weird relationship pairing, I even appreciated Greg's \\"Sonnyless\\" work with Cher; it really got a hold on me.      With hope, I bought \\"Low country blues\\" and I promptly took the c.d. along on a ride on a country road in Falls Township, Pennsylvania.  \\"The song \\"Floating Bridge\\" made strong appeal as I watched ducks swim across a pond.  \\"Little by Little\\" gave some assurance I had made a good purchase, but outside of \\"Just another rider,\\" I became just another rider looking for Greg's basic better.

It also is not too heavy and doesn't make the empty stroller topple backward. I would recommend this product.
B004WKOCP8|4.0|I had a feeling that this album would be very divisive amongst long time Incubus fans. And I get it. When you've become somewhat emotionally involved with a band, it's hard to let go of who they were and to see a new album from an objective standpoint, and even I've been victim to that. I've been an Incubus fan for the better part of ten years now, and as with every Incubus album before it, this album is quite different from any of their other albums.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, as I appreciate when a band can grow and change, and not be stuck in the same sound for their whole career. Maybe that works for bands like Nickelback or AC/DC, but not Incubus.  Let me preface this by saying I was sorely disappointed in Light Grenades.  Before it was released, I had high hopes for it. When the cover art came out, I wasn't impressed, but I thought \\"You can't judge a book by its cover, right?\\" Light Grenades was a scatterbrained mess. While it had a few good songs, it was difficult to listen to the album as a whole because it would go from one song being a mellow, acoustic number, the next would be a frantic, heavy rocker, followed by an upbeat, poppy song.  Many songs were uninspired and boring. And the songs that managed to resemble old school Incubus were quite watered down. To top it off, the two best songs recorded during that period, \\"Punch Drunk\\" (one of my personal favorite Incubus songs) and \\"Look Alive\\" were left off completely.<br /><br />So after my disappointment with Light Grenades, I figured this time around Incubus would come back with something much, much better. And they did - but it wasn't quite what I would've expected.  When \\"Adolescents\\" was released, I was excited because it had the atmospheric, almost psychedelic vibe to it that made me love songs like \\"Sick, Sad Little World\\" and \\"Punch Drunk.\\" I figured this time around Incubus would explore pursue that sound in full force. But the band was right when they said \\"Adolescents\\" was the closest thing resembling their old sound.<br /><br />\\"If Not Now, When?\\" is a really good album; however, you have to appreciate it for its subtleties. The album has no loud, aggressive songs, and few of Einziger's trademark solos. But it is perhaps Incubus' most musically consistent album to date. It's beautiful and flows better than perhaps any of Incubus' past albums. I also find it to be much more emotionally engaging than some of their other albums. Also, the lyrics this time around are more well thought out than many of the corny and cliched lyrics that appeared on Light Grenades. Some songs faintly resemble Morning View-era Incubus, such as \\"Isadore\\" (one of my favorites from this album) and \\"Defiance\\", a catchy little acoustic track. \\"In the Company of Wolves\\" almost sounds like something that would fit in on Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall.\\" \\"Switchblade\\" is an oddity on the album, and almost reminds me of Kings of Leon.  Overall, though, the album is quite addictive once you get into it, and is much, much better than Light Grenades.sembling their old sound.    \\"If Not Now, When?\\" is a really good album; however, you have to appreciate it for its subtleties.

1401322425|5.0|We love watching Jamie at Home on TV and so it was natural that we would want the cook book that details the recipes.  We have enjoyed many of them at home with veggies from our local organic co-op farm.       I do recommend it for anyone who loves cooking fresh.
B004XIQIPQ|2.0|So I just gave the album a couple listens on a newly launched US music service (harks from the UK if you didn't know), and I have to say, I am very disappointed. The experimentation heard on \\"Humbug\\" left you feeling as if the band was definitely heading in a new direction, you just didn't know if it was a good or bad one. After hearing \\"Suck it and See\\", the band is clearly headed NOWHERE. I can't even insult them for being way too experimental cause they aren't. All that's on for show is basic strumming and strolling throughout the majority of the record that a band playing in a bowling alley could accomplish on an off night.     What makes the disappointment more severe is the expectations levied from the release of the single \\"Don't Sit Down Cause' I've Moved your Chair\\". The lyrics in it are silly (but not in the fun way heard in \\"Whatever you say...\\" and \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\") but the guitar work is so good. It sounded like a British Alice in Chains if I were to draw a comparison, but in some ways, that lowers what was accomplished in the single as it is its own sound, and I thought it was a welcome following to \\"Crying Lightning\\" (which I did like btw).    However, a vast majority of this album feels phoned in. There is no instrumental complexity anywhere. Currently, \\"The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala\\" is the second most popular song on this album and I have absolutely NO IDEA WHY! The vocals are prominent, but I have zero clue how the instruments sound even remotely catchy or interesting. \\"Brick by Brick\\" is one of those decent album songs that's not quite good enough to be a single, but yet, it is one of the two FEATURED singles. This song would get the ax if it was on either of the first two albums.    Before I spend more time discussing why I don't like this, I sum it up by saying it's slow (slower than \\"Humbug\\"), simplistic (think old school Brit Pop bands), and almost nothing is catchy (if it is, it can't maintain it throughout the song, or it just has a strong finish and a boring start, either way, NOT WORTH A PURCHASE!).    I'm a QotSA fan (in particular anything LIVE from Amsterdam, it is ridiculously good and makes songs I didn't like listenable *cough* Misfit Love *cough*), but I'd be lying if on most of their albums, I didn't want to throw away 75% of what was on there. And if you took away 'Rated R' and 'Songs for the Deaf', that number would jump to almost 90%. Arctic Monkeys can't be throwing out albums similar to QotSA where they expect you to hang on to just a couple good/decent songs. If it was really experimental, at least I could walk away and say \\"They aren't for me anymore\\". However, they just came across as burnt out acid junkies who can't be creative and do a full album anymore.    Please pull it together for the next album, or better yet, just do an EP. There's no way you guys can mess that up.
B004Q8FTE4|4.0|This import all inclusive box set of Roger's CD's and the one DVD reminds me greatly of a similar Sony set that came out earlier this year for Bruce Springsteen. While it does appear to cover all his solo recorded material, there isn't any bonus or extra material here. This is simply a basic reissuing of the solo albums, in fact with almost not a single ounce of extras.<br /><br />The CD's each come in pretty simple sleeves, without separate liner notes, but there is a small booklet that covers the album essentials for each release. I feel like so much more could have been done with the liner or supporting materials alone, again just exactly as I felt with the economy Springsteen box from Sony. Not that this is exactly a bad thing given the overall economy minded pricing structure, but as a fan of both artists I could have stood to have a bit of extras, with an attempt to add some fancy box set fluff and frankly I would have been happy to pay for that effort.<br /><br />For those looking to expand a collection or maybe better start one, this set will do nicely and is a great overall price. You are getting 6 CD's plus a DVD for less than $6 per disk in a pretty sturdy set box fair to mention as well.<br /><br />For what it is worth the re-mastering if there was any, leaves this music sounding as great as you would expect from Roger Waters.
140053271X|3.0|I just bought the kindle and I'm regretting it. Who ever said that the kindle has a better library is telling lies B&N has an equal or better ebook and \\"app\\" library. Im about to return it because the Nook is a better e-reader and has better features. I'm just happy I havent thrown my Kindle package away because i'm returning it after 3 days. Kindle would be better for my mom or grandmother but for me. Its a No!
0307456625|5.0|I have seen this series advertised for a long time. I read the first one and was pleasantly surprised. I had no idea it was set in Africa. The book was a delight. I liked the main character, Mma Ramsotswe. She is smart, interesting and definitely brave. Her descriptions of Africa make me want to visit.<br /><br />You will love these books. It is a fantastic series! I am already in the middle of the second one and I look forward to reading all of them.
B004P9FAK2|4.0|If you're a fan of J. K. Rowling's colossal book series then this is a no brainer.  The special feature \\"A Year in Life of J. Rowling\\" would be worth the extra money spent.  However this edition has so much to offer that even viewers who are not fans of the book will find this version appealing for its variety. The high definition picture and sound are amazing.  The movie iself looks and sounds as good as it did in theaters.  Also most of the special features are in HD as well.  Did I say special features?  This 2 disc set contains over six hours of special features too numerous to list.  Movie lovers that are not necessarily fans of the series will be thrilled with the numerous insights into the film-makers' process.<br />  For true fans the set contains a fifty page book, two Harry Potter series trading cards and a lenticular card(what used to be called holograms) front cover.  This is one of the most thorough special editions I've seen.  Everything included was of a fine quality and the film comes with the addition of a digital copy, this seems to be the status quo lately thanks to the ipod phenomenon, that can be downloaded to your computer and taken in on the go.<br />  For the price, this set is amazing and leaves little to be desired.  So if you have about eight free hours with nothing to do I would definitely recommend checking this one out.
0375842209|5.0|Very rarely a book comes out that steals my breath away. The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak is a revelation. Narrated by Death, this story follows Leisel as she steals books in Nazi Germany while she and her best friend Rudy discover the power of words, language and friendship. Zusak's writing is mesmerizing; it's sarcastic, emotional, sophisticated and wondrous.    If you only read one book this year, read this one. Share it with your friends and family. I don't expect to read anything better this year, or next year either.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Fun book.  Done well with background, a plot, some historical views and an exciting way of looking into memory as a skill (and not a born physical attribute).  I'd write more but I forgot most of the book as I read it over 3 weeks ago.
0345529057|5.0|I stumbled across this page and saw a handful of 1-star reviews that left me puzzled. Then I realized that all of them were regarding the supposedly-poor quality of the Kindle version. Well, I can't tell you anything about the Kindle version. I'm one of those old-school guys, so I bought the paperback set, and it's undoubtedly worth the money. Obviously, the content is 5-star worthy (see the reviews for each individual book), so I'm going to limit my review to the box set itself. This set contains each of the first four books in the Song of Ice and Fire Series (that's A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Feast for Crows), with all-new cover artwork. Out of all the versions released, this is the most visually enrapturing artwork yet. The novels are brightly colored and contain designs that are brilliant in their simplicity. The outer box contains some high-quality shots from the upcoming HBO series.    Highly recommended for:  -Someone who's never read A Song of Ice and Fire. This is the place to start, and a great value too (4 loooong books for $23).  -Longtime fans whose old paperback copies are worn from reading and re-reading in anticipation of A Dance With Dragons.  -Hardcore series collectors who want to own the best versions.    I lent my older copies of this series to my ex-girlfriend, and since I never got them back, I decided that this box set was a worthy purchase. I'm so satisfied with it, I can honestly say that I don't miss the books I lost, not even one bit. I've posted some pictures of the box set so you can decide for yourself if you like its look enough to drop the money.
B004U52VPS|4.0|It is a good game to entertaining kids without the use of video games or video games!    Well made and looks like so far the rubber catapult is durable as my kids have been using it a lot without any problems.    I recommend it for educational purposes too, as teach them how to play using their ability to point the target and to strategize without the use or help of any software, etc.
0307271862|1.0|I only finished the book because i feel like i should finish every book I start.  It was painful to finish though.  The book groans on about a history of China.  The characters never fully develop.  The mystery is so shallow you can skip a stone across it.  The book cover reviewers shouldnt be reviewing books.  Clearly they had a financial gain to have given the reviews they gave.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I saw lots of 1s and 2s for reviews, so I decided to offer my review. You cannot skip this book. It is necessary to know what is going on in the overall storyline. Perhaps this is Mr. Martin's weak link, but it is still action packed and has plenty of folks who we know and love or know and hate in it.
B004ZGM76A|5.0|Sucker Punch rocks with remixes of some of the greatest classic music, superb actors and action packed insanity. Most people don't get the plot of the movie or the ending and I won't try to explain it. All I can say is that this movie is full of action, adventure, sadness, confusion, a dark reality, fantasy, and chicks kicking butt. If you like all these things wrapped into one, then you will love Sucker Punch. Lastly, it has a lot of sexual content and gore so parents be warned when watching this movie, you may want to keep your children out of the room despite it's PG-13 rating.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I am a huge fan of the series. If you made it through the first four books, by now you know that Mr. Martin has 7 books planned so this is not the end of the series. He did a good job of fleshing out the story and left us lots of cliffhangers to make us long for the next book.  I still hate the bad guys and hope that some of the good guys last until the last book. I would think that Martin has tons of motivation to get the series completed with his HBO exposure to current and future fans.<br />Read it. It is a great escape from the real world.
0393327655|1.0|Sorry Sam, but I had to put it down halfway through chapter 6. I just couldn't read any more of your subjective, intolerant and abstract ranting.  After reading Hitchens and Dawkins, and watching the four horseman discussions (where you seemed like a modest and reasonable man) I was truly interested to see what your view was, and hopefully read some of your thoughts on how to bring about a more rational, cohesive society.  Instead I got a tirade of divise abuse and close mindedness, directed primarily at Islam, which horrified me. Your thoughts on morality, torture, your constant \\"imagine this\\" scenarios,  your \\"science of good and evil\\" were all absurd. After attacks on Chomsky and Gandhi (where I could go on any more), I had to admit that some supposedly \\"rational\\" thinkers are far too extreme to listen to.   I agree that religious and faith based thinking can harbor some extremism that is potentially (and realistically) dangerous. But do you really think that fanning the flames of intolerance is the way towards a better future? Hardly. Any idiot knows that when fire comes up against fire it only creates a bigger fire. There's a little analogy you can think about. On the whole I think Joe Rogan has better ideas about east and west intergration in Shiny Happy Jihad.
B000SW16MQ|5.0|Worked out great ( I downloaded from amazon video). The color was off at first (it was my first time using amazon video) and all I had to do was adjust the brightness and contrast on the video program and it was great. I love me some Dexter!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|\\"Fly From Here\\" is the best new YES material in a long time.... way better than \\"The Ladder\\" or \\"Magnification\\" in my opinion. Although both those albums had some good material I don't think they had the cohesiveness of this new one. I don't think that there has been anything this good since some of the \\"Keys to Ascension\\" studio tracks...\\"That That Is\\" for example. The whole Trevor Rabin era left me cold... apart from \\"Shoot High Aim Low\\" from Big Generator. Then there was \\"Open your Eyes\\" and the odd \\"Union\\" album as well as the Anderson/Wakeman/Bruford/Howe project all of which contained interesting stuff and was well worth listening to... (as you would expect with musicians of this calibre)... but never really had long lasting appeal.<br /><br />The absence of Anderson and Wakeman from this new album seems a shame when one remembers such great works as \\"Awaken\\" from \\"Going for the One\\"... but I must admit that these two have also taken with them a certain level of fluffy new age campyness. This new album \\"Fly From Here\\" benefits from a more grounded approach to the songs. Great production values, very melodic and musically strong but without the overly syrupy style of many recent Yessongs. ( \\"And give love to give the given presence presently giving love to the living giving within with love\\") . None of that sillyness on \\"Fly From Here\\".<br /><br />YES have been making great music for well over 40 years now and everyone has their own likes and dislikes from different eras and different lineups in their long career. I think it would be a shame if this album didn't get a fair reception just because long time fans can't get past the absence of Jon Anderson. It's inspired me to purchase the newly remastered \\"Drama\\" album because in 1980 I refused to give that album a fair go for the same reasons. \\"Drama\\"... the album so roundly rejected on it's release and the album so well thought of years later.<br /><br />\\"Fly From Here\\" is an excellent new album from \\"Yes\\".... and it was a very happy surprise, as I (foolishly) hadn't expected too much at all.<br /><br /> As an aside.... I must recommend two albums by a band called Glass Hammer. The albums are titled \\"IF\\" and \\"Cor Cordium\\" and have the latest YES vocalist Jon Davison working with the band. I had totally disregarded \\"Glass Hammer\\" as YES wannabes.... but honestly, these two recent albums are of such a high standard....really the sort of thing that YES SHOULD be achieving these days....<br />An honest and unbiased appraisal tells me that \\"IF\\" and \\"Cor Cordium\\" by \\"Glass Hammer\\" are actually a lot better than any recent YES material since the Keys To Ascension studio tracks...nd it was a very happy surprise, as I (foolishly) hadn't expected too much at all.<br /><br /> As an aside....

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I am only half way through the book, and I just want to say that the book is so well written that I hope she sells 10,000,000 copies and a blockbuster movie and makes a bazillion dollars. Perhaps that will offset somehow the incredible nightmare that guy and his wife made her endure for all those years
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This really is a solid arena shooter. Funny throwaway humor accents the blood spattered shooting. The first boss is a Zombie T-Rex which is somewhat derivative yet hilarious because of it. Zany humor, great animation and gore-filled zombie slaughter through multiple time periods. People that rated it low probably don't have a decent enough phone. I played on a T-Mobile HTC G2.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I didn't know any details of this story when I first saw the cover story in People Magazine.  I bought the book on it's release and couldn't put it down.  I am so moved and amazed at what she went through and the brutal honesty she used in the book.
6305308659|4.0|This is not a nostalgic flashback to the innocent 50s when all was \\"pleasant\\".  According to the movie, sex, grief, and anger are more valuable than pleasantness.  The characters turn from black and white to color as they experience knowledge of self for the first time: masturbation, hook ups, fights, adultery, spouse abandonment, selfishness, independence all turn the repressed into living color.  Subplot: intolerance of the black and whites towards the colorized who just want to have fun being publicly nude, cheating on spouse, painting graffiti, etc. 5 stars for the cinematography.  4 stars for overly obvious plot and slow pacing.  Whether it is 1 to 5 stars on theme depends on one's values.
0385340990|4.0|I put off reading this because it looked like the type that I should enjoy reading rather more than I actually would....<br />Fortunately I was wrong- it was a thoroughly enjoyable and relaxing read.<br />If you are expecting great literature, you'll be dissapointed, it is rather less serious and more fun  that it looked- fortunately for me:-)<br />While the characters are a little stereotypical, and the  territory well-worn, it is still an enjoyable version of the classic English Village story.
0671004107|3.0|CONTACT begins with the greatest idea of them all--that somehow, someway and somewhere, life exists beyond the small blue world called Earth. It is in these moments of the beginning of this novel that a grand adventure begins to be spelled out. In that adventure rests none other than Doctor Eleanor Arroway, a woman whose intelligence and drive magnifies her far beyond those of her peers.<br /><br />It is one day, after an extremely-difficult line of work and a declaration that her SETI project will be shut down, that an unknown message begins to come from the Vega star in distant space--a message bearing, what appears to be, schematics for something far greater than anyone could ever possibly imagine.<br /><br />As a reader of speculative fiction, and a fan of the science-fiction genre as a whole, I jumped into this book with excitement shortly after viewing the movie adaptation that features Jodi Foster and Matthew McConaughey. Thinking that it would be vastly different than the original movie, I ventured forward believing that the book would be something different--something that, regardless of its genre's tenants, would absolutely blow me away. To say that I was underwhelmed would be an understatement, and for that I sadly have to say that I did not enjoy this book as much as I could have.<br /><br />With science-fiction, there is always a bridging line between the actual science and the fiction itself that can either make or break a book for a particular sub-sect of readers, mainly those who enjoy the idea of far-off worlds and alien civilizations but are not, in the least, intelligent enough to know specifics details about astronomy, radio waves and other technological jargon. Being a reader following into that sub-sect, I have to say that much of the time, I found the book doing just what it was I feel many science-fiction novels do in order to make up for the fact that there seems not to be enough `science' and too much `fiction'--mainly, of course, making the science much too heavy a role in the story. While I don't necessarily feel that this book lacked the essentials needed to make this a realistic story, I do feel as though the book (and its now deceased author) went to strong lengths in order to make this as set in stone as possible. For that alone I found myself cringing over three-page-long descriptions of certain scientific actions, theories and equations, and while that may have been beneficial to the story, I feel as though CONTACT could have done without so much of the science and more of the fiction itself.<br /><br />To say that the book is bad would be wrong. The writing is, at times, beautiful; eloquently strung together and written in a way that marks Sagan as someone who also, along with his astounding intelligence, had the ability to write. While reading certain passages, I found myself blown away at how they were strung together, worded, and ultimately assembled to create the overall mood of the science in the story. To say this is a smart book would be like comparing an apple to a seed, and while the scientific endeavors that line this book is great, I have to say that I felt little emotion connection to the characters--particularly Arroway, who, as our main character, should have had a stronger focus within the overall story--that dealt a huge blow to the fictional connection between reader and main character.<br /><br />While I would not recommend the novelization of CONTACT to most everyone, given its scientific-slant, I can honestly say that the writing itself is beautiful and, if only for a few chapters alone, should be given a chance. While I may have felt a bit disappointed with the novel, that doesn't mean others will follow my path.a role in the story.

1451629184|5.0|I highly recommend this book! It is an amazing tale of survival and strength. The book is very touching and sometimes hard to read and/or believe (though certainly true). You never want to have to imagine that a young child had to endure what she did. The strength this beautiful young woman has is jaw-dropping. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down & read the whole book the same day I bought it. Not even Hollywood could make this stuff up. A truly amazing memoir.    I purchased the book at Costco for $14.49 + tax.

B000V4UFZK|5.0|Apart from the special effects disaster that is \\"the mirror scene,\\" Poltergeist delivers one of the most effective, engrossing, and eerie presentations in movie history.  Who can ever get the ill-fated Heather O'Rourke's \\"They're here\\" line or the fantastic performance of the diminutive Zelda Rubenstein as the psychic house \\"cleaner\\" Tangina?  JoBeth Williams, for her part, turns in a fantastic performance, cementing her position as the emotional center of the story.  Heck, everyone involved did a great job with this movie, including the dog.  I'm often critical of Tobe Hooper's directing, but there is no doubt that Poltergeist represents his finest directorial work (although rumor has it that producer/co-writer Steven Spielberg did more than his share of the directing job).<br /><br />I'm not sure why they called this film Poltergeist because the goings-on in the Freeling house go way, way beyond typical poltergeist activity.  Things start out small (chair stacking, objects moving on their own, utensils bending on their own), but it doesn't take long for things to get completely out of hand.  Initially, though, the stage is set with the typical fears most all of us experienced as children - fear of the dark, the closet, something under the bed, thunder storms, stuffed toys that suddenly become creepy when the lights are out.  Fortunately for most of us, those fears are just childish fancies.  The same cannot be said for the Freeling children.  Unable to go to the police with their story (yes, officer, we think our lost daughter is somewhere in the house and we can still communicate with her through the television from time to time), the Freelings call upon local paranormal researchers for help.  Needless to say, this blows the socks off of every other case they've investigated, leaving them no choice but to call in reinforcements in the form of a short but formidable medium (Rubenstein).  Then, just when you think things are under control, the movie ratchets things up to new heights of action and suspense.<br /><br />Poltergeist definitely has the potential to frighten some viewers, with scare tactics ranging from the small and subtle to the unbelievably grandiose - and even the most over-the-top occurrences work in the context of the presentation.  No stranger to large special effects budgets, Spielberg made sure that all of the visual effects were believable (including the use of real human skeletons in one scene) and added to the suspense of the story (except that mirror scene, which really does feature some of the worst special effects I've ever seen in my life).  Not having seen this movie in many, many years, I had forgotten just how impressive it was.  It features some of the best interaction of actors with special effects that I've ever seen, making it easy to keep suspending your disbelief in the face of the most incredible of circumstances.  You even get a sense of resolution at the end, which is something you rarely find in horror movies today.  Poltergeist is, without doubt, a classic in every sense of the word.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the Poltergeist curse (a result, some say, of using real skeletons in the movie), which adds yet another layer to the atmosphere of the film.  As most people know, Heather O'Rourke died tragically at the age of 12, but it's easy to forget that her co-star Dominique Dunne (daughter of novelist Dominick Dunne) was murdered by her ex-boyfriend within months of the film's release.  Of course, the curse doesn't seem to have affected Craig T. Nelson, who went on to have a long and successful acting career.  You can't help but feel sad, though, watching cute and talented little Heather O'Rourke, knowing that she died so young.ew heights of action and suspense.

It features some of the best interaction of actors with special effects that I've ever seen, making it easy to keep suspending your disbelief in the face of the most incredible of circumstances.   You even get a sense of resolution at the end, which is something you rarely find in horror movies today.  Poltergeist is, without doubt, a classic in every sense of the word.    I would be remiss if I didn't also mention the Poltergeist curse (a result, some say, of using real skeletons in the movie), which adds yet another layer to the atmosphere of the film.  As most people know, Heather O'Rourke died tragically at the age of 12, but it's easy to forget that her co-star Dominique Dunne (daughter of novelist Dominick Dunne) was murdered by her ex-boyfriend within months of the film's release.  Of course, the curse doesn't seem to have affected Craig T. Nelson, who went on to have a long and successful acting career.  You can't help but feel sad, though, watching cute and talented little Heather O'Rourke, knowing that she died so young.
0439796636|5.0|This book sadly reminds us of the unsung heros of The Great War...Horses and Machines..like non other..In combat..with Men who loved them and depended on them to save there lives,and Help Win another senseless war.....that humans start....This is like Reading Black Beauty for the first time...from the horses point of view...I wish it had been as long...but it is very well done...its a short easy read.....and though painful at times....it takes us back to a time when only blood sweat and tears from both man and beast prevailed...
B0055FR5PS|2.0|Having had an illness lately and being bed bound a bit I have been in search of action movies to get my mind off my suffering. Two of the ones I saw in this vain were: The Eagle, and \\"I am number four\\". Neither were great, but I could get subsumed in the reality they created. Battle Los Angeles on the other hand was super cliched and not very believable at any level. We are supposed to empathize with the staff sarge and his personal pain and then watch him as he performance continuous heroic acts that make his soldiers worship him. Following him everywhere he says hoorah. I love a good action war film and I'm hoping cowboys vs aliens lives up to expectations. As far as this piece of trash though, save your money.
B004UHF51S|5.0|We have been so looking forward to this release.  Thank you Michael for a superb album - another remarkable addition to your wonderful canon of music over the years.    It is interesting in the various reviews to note the comparisons of Time Together with Michael's other works - with recurring references to the brilliant Passionfruit.  As has been said, there really have been no \\"weak links\\" in Michael's output since The Art Of Tea - always musically unique, original and richly rhythmic and melodic - and lyrically a feast of wit, with touches of irony and pure humanity.  Although perhaps slightly less brilliant Skin Dive and The Camera Never Lies nevertheless still contained the masterpieces \\"Now I Know (Why They Call It Falling)\\", \\"When She Is Mine\\" and \\"Innuendo\\"; Rendezvous in Rio, for me, was incomparable - but, again, all his works have been so.    Has there ever been a singer/songwriter over the past 40 years (closest others being perhaps Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and James Taylor) that has been so consistently strong, and whom one can so repeatedly listen to and never tire?    Time Together stands proudly among all of Michael's albums - it has been wonderful to appreciate its subtleties and nuances more and more on repeated playing.  How beautiful to have sunshine and summer sprinkled upon us down here \\"deep in July\\" in mid-winter Australia - (as Michael would say \\"the weather's completely upside down\\").    It seems ungrateful to say, but please Michael don't make us wait too long for your next album - you remain at the peak of your exceptional creative powers.
B000J10ER4|5.0|I THINK THIS MOVIE WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE. THAT IS WHY I ORDERED IT FROM AMAZION.COM. IT WAS RIGHT UP THERE WITH ALL THE PREVIOUS MOVIES.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I just received my unit yesterday, and I have been playing on it non-stop since it arrived (with a few hours of sleep).  The detail/resolution of the screen is great, and there is no lag from the screen when I play online.  Even my blue-ray movies on my PS3 look great!  Also I have ever so thankful for the Hard plastic case. When I closed it up for the night, my dog knocked it off the small table I had it set on(I was soo mad!).  When I opened it up I expected the worst, but absolutely nothing inside was damaged!  My PS3 started right back up, and the screen was not cracked, not even a scratch, crack, or dent on the case.    I will definitely be more careful in the future (Bad Dog).  Thank you GAEMS for making sure a great product!

0553801473|3.0|I am in book 4 of the series and I am disappointed. The first time the author killed of a character I had come to love, I was in shock.  Okay, I recovered and kept reading. The next time the author killed off a leading character I was disappointed but accepted it as central to the story.  But now I am tired of what I consider a needless massacre of pertinent people central to the story line. I could not put book one down. I was excited to get into book two. By book three my interest was slowing down and here I am in book four and I have not picked it up in three days. I think the author overreached. This story has hundreds of characters and while having them listed in the back of the book has helped, still, it's overwhelming.  And why is there no mention on any of the maps as to where the Narrow Sea is located? I am disappointed overall. I don't even know if I am going to purchase book five. Something has to happen in book four to capture me before I buy any more of the story.
031261246X|5.0|Mark Russinovich weaves a great, thoughtful story line which is down right scary at times.  The author has a very technical background. I have heard rave reviews about this book including security expert Steve Gibson.  Steve writes \\"ZERO-DAY (the novel) by Mark Russinovich, REALLY A GREAT READ, and frightening since it's possible!\\"        I am enjoying this book very much.  It is very technically accurate but written at a level that an average person will still enjoy the read very much.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|We picked up this Gaming case thing last week as we were leaving for a trip. This was a B-day present for my 14yo son who asked for it. Hesitant at first but based on what happened I have a new appreciation.  One of the first things we found out was both my wife and I were able to use it as well to watch Netflix vs. having to pay for movies in the hotel room, also we didn't have to fight over the tv in room as he had this portable device and could play in the room or down in the lobby of the hotel which he was perfectly happy with. He said he meet many friends as he received much attention playing out in public.  The case seems to be made of a rugged heavy plastic and the monitor looked larger than the 15.5\\" that it says it comes with and overall quality was good. The size was compact enough that my son was able to carry it on and no issues going through security as they didn't ask us to open it up vs. my laptop that still required me to take out of my bag, go figure.  All in all multiple uses and the kid and wife were happy..
0670022411|4.0|This is a wonderful and fast paced book. I am a reader but with I dont always have the time, with this book I finished it in 4 days. The characters were great in delivering their roles. The history and the images that are brought to light are great. I cant wait to read the next part to the story. highly recommend.
B001G83TQ2|4.0|There is at least one layer to cut through  when listening to 1980s music: that gleaming production and those big drums automatically mark any 1980s music as such, and you have to get past that to tell your Prefab Sprout from your Debbie Gibson. The pearls from the swine.<br /><br />Simply Red falls into the pearls camp: this is unmistakeably smooth pop soul in a 1980s wrapper, but soul none the less. Men And Women is comprised of funky tracks and smooth ballads that have gospel vocals, fresh chord changes, and well placed instrumental surprises--dig on the trumpet.  The singer is one of the best blue-eyed spokesmen of the genre.<br /><br />For me, this music works on a lot of levels. I had a terrible time as a disabled person in 1980s high school. But my father also passed this year, and the better class of 1980s pop brings me back to a more innocent, secure time. Simply Red is a conflicted and emotionally complex listening experience for me, and that makes it a rich and edgy ride.<br /><br />But beyond my subjectivity and the Regan Era production, this is good music, whether you yearn for 1980s sounds or have to work your way past them to hear the substance. We listen to all kinds of music for all kinds of reasons and bring all types of emotions to an album before the stereo even clicks on. If you can't feel music, why play it at all. But if are going to play music, you simply can't get higher class than Simply Red.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I read this book in one sitting.  Could not put it down.  Here Jaycee Dugard's story is obviously told not by a ghostwriter but in her own voice.  We learn about her horrific kidnapping and her eighteen years in captivity.  Maybe more importantly, we get to know her.  Reading it is a chance to meet a remarkable young woman.  She is a talented writer who often kept a journal during her captive years and some fragments of her journal survived and are reprinted here.  She is admirable, someone who suffered greatly but preserved her sanity, her natural kindness, and her humanity.  Her compassion and love for animals moved me very much--that she stayed a feeling and caring person is striking.<br /><br />I hope there will be a sequel to this book because I want to know more about her later life.  She made up stories in her head to help keep herself sane.  I hope she flowers as a major literary talent--if that is what she wants.  I identify with her because I'm a writer--well, maybe every reader will identify with her just because every reader is a human being. But I wonder if in the same circumstances I could emerge as strong as she did, and write such a great book.  She may be eagerly reading her reviews, as new writers often do.  Jaycee Dugard, if you do read this, please know how much I admire you.  You are both kind and tough-minded, a wonderful combination.  This world will benefit from your voice.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|This was my favorite game until it lost my  progress this week. Im not sure if Im going start over again. Its also uses a lot of disk space compared to other games.
B0058P7KUA|3.0|This game is pretty fun if you're a fan of oldschool shooter games such as Smash TV. Good weapon upgrades and various grenade types keep the action going. There's a bit of humor and memes thrown in for good measure.  However that can't save the shoddy control scheme. I understand this was the most viable option for this kind of game, but the touch-based dual stick controls happened to stutter, move a different direction, or just stop. This happened far too many times. There's nothing more frustrating than kiting a bunch of zombies, only to have your character stop dead in his tracks and then get chewed up by said zombies.  I used a Droid R2D2 for this game. Ran fine, other than the sloppy controls.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Hello friends,  I have to say this is a most delightful film.    It is a cohesive experience (the lighting/the locations/the sets/the actors/the script et al) and frankly one I think people would benefit by to view at least monthly to help you keep our perspective on things.    I especially like (for me anyway) that while I certainly empathize and am involved with the characters, I for some reason really learned from them.    It's kind of like an out of body experience - you're there, you are integral but able to view the situation and 'see' it for what it is.   I loved it.
B004Y1USJE|3.0|First, let me say that I am glad seeing this many reviews pop up after being released for only three days! It shows a definite interest and healthy discussion about the \\"legendary\\" band Yes. Keep 'em coming. After following  Yes for over 4 decades I have to weigh in.    While I so desperately wanted to dislike the CD, I must admit that I just cannot. It is a solid piece of work. Granted, it is no 5 star and will never be destined to be a Yes \\"classic\\". Those days are long gone for Yes, as they are for any once dominant musical group of the 70's and 80's. The reason I wanted to dislike \\"Fly From Here\\" was because of all the issues surrounding the departure of Jon Anderson. Can there be a Yes without Jon Anderson. I think we all need to remember here that the only consistent torch bearer in Yes is Chris Squire. He is THE ONLY member who has been on virtually every single album/CD containing the title of Yes. Dare I say Yes is Chris's group. I say Yes is Chris's group. If you read any history of Yes it was Chris who spent months, locked away, honing his signature bass sound that became the foundation of all Yes music. So...can there be a Yes without Jon Anderson, of course, there already has been. So, all personal feelings aside, this is a good release without Jon Anderson. (Personally, much better than \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and \\"Magnification\\") Different without him, but it does not deserve to be rated as \\"bad\\" because of it.  One can dislike it for other reasons but don't just dismiss it because Jon is not the vocalist. Let me just break it down into some pros and cons:    Pros:  You still have one of the most recognizable, and best, rhythm sections in rock music with Steve Howe, Chris Squire, and Alan White. You have solid song writing with the unmistakable Yes sound. They bring back extended pieces of music rather than the short pop style of songs found on such works \\"Open Your Eyes\\" and \\"Big Generator\\". Geoff Downes  is a suitable keyboard replacement, although a bit unimaginative. (He does what he needs to do, about the same at Patrick Moraz  did.) (Downes played on Drama.)Keyboards have always been a revolving door with Yes anyway so you get used to different sounds. (I know, I know, Wakeman was the best. But then he is \\"world class\\") A really nice variety of song styles and lengths. You even get a solo acoustic number by Steve, \\"Solitaire\\".  It has been ages since we have had one of those on a new Yes release.  Cons:  Trevor Horn as the producer. The producer is so instrumental (no pun intended) in the way a group will sound on any particular release. I have never been fond of the way he makes Yes sound. He was responsible for the \\"90125\\" and \\"Big Generator\\". If you liked the way those works sounded then you will probably not have a problem with FFH. Personally, I think he makes them sound too sterile, too 80ish if that is actually a sound. Jon Anderson is not singing. I am not saying that Benoit David does not do a fine job. I can just hear different parts where Jon's voice would be much more appropriate and his interpretations much better in fitting with the music.     So the pros and cons really cancel each other out. This is a piece of work that everyone will have a different take on, simply based on who you like and who you don't like. Bottom line to me, it is a good Yes release, regardless of the players, and I like it. I am not going to say it is a \\"must buy\\" but I really can't think that any fan of Yes would be totally disappointed either.  Hence the 3 stars. You may like it, or you may not, but buy it to support the band. Good luck finding it in a store. It is a small label with limited distribution. (I gave up after checking three major music sellers.)  I would just order it on line or down load it.
B004Y1USV2|2.0|I have been a fan of YES for 40 years.  I bought this CD without listening to it because I have faith in them.  I was mistaken this time.  I cannot believe what has happened to my favorite group.  The only track worth listening to is #10, Steve Howe has a beautiful acoustic piece.  What is missing?  Jon Anderson.  I never realized he is more the the vocalist for the group, he was their composer.  One would be better off buying Jon Anderson's new CD, it's beautiful.  I waited 10 years for new YES music and they let me down.

B000WMFZMY|5.0|A chance to relive a movie I saw on the big screen 20 years ago in an excellent print. Was Sophia Loren ever more beautiful? and such a great cast around her. Heston, while much the same in his movies, is well chosen as the hero type. As for Herbert Lom's Ben Jusef: did George Lucas get the inspiration for Darth Vader there? Great movie and I wholeheartedly agree with Scorsese's assessment of the movie on the front cover.

0061784788|3.0|Sigma, the &uuml;ber-secret military/spy/anti-spy/espionage arm of DARPA, makes their seventh outing, again matching wits with their nefarious and even more secret foe, \\"The Guild\\".  A young Indian defies ancient warnings about never entering a secret tribal cave, because if anyone ever did, the world would end.  He enters anyway, and the next thing you know, the earth is being eaten away, inactive volcanoes are spewing, and civilization is on a short count to extinction.<br /><br />This is marketed as a techno-thriller, but it's really either science fiction or fantasy, depending on how generous you'd like to be.  We have a lost tribe of Israel journeying to America a couple thousand years ago, and they bring with them some highly advanced nanotechnology.  If the author had given this a bit of explanation, I'd call it sci-fi.  But nanotechnology isn't one of those sorts of things you just stumble across, it requires a highly industrialized society wielding extremely technologically advanced equipment.  There is not one word of explanation of how all this infrastructure disappeared without a trace.  Nor is there an explanation of what possible use these highly destructive nanobots would have, or why they are the only thing this lost tribe brought along with them.  All of which puts this more in the fantasy realm, if you ask me.<br /><br />The author either isn't very familiar with the military, or has simply chosen to take extraordinarily broad poetic license when dealing with them.  An Apache helicopter chases two people on horseback through some thin woods, fires thousands of rounds, and never gets a hit.  The rider wheels, charges the chopper, fires a handgun at it, and the helicopter breaks off.  It sounds like something straight out of \\"A-Team\\".  You have to either cringe or howl at this and similar examples.  The science gets pretty iffy as well.  When you have a hacker cracking a sophisticated military encryption scheme in a matter of moments, it's not spellbinding fiction, it's laugh out loud silliness.<br /><br />Still, if you push your \\"suspension of disbelief\\" button hard enough, you can enjoy a pretty entertaining story.  The author does a good job of filling in character backgrounds and Sigma details, so you shouldn't be lost if this is your introduction to the series.  I have only read the first Sigma novel, and didn't have any problems.  The pace is quick and the suspense builds fairly well, despite the utter predictability of the bad guys.  I don't know that I'd read any more of the Sigma books, but I did kinda like this one.'s laugh out loud silliness.

0062060554|5.0|This is a debut novel for S.J. Watson and it is a good one. The plot involves Christine, a 47 year old amnesiac who wakes up each day with no memory of her life. Her husband Ben is a stranger to her. Each day he explains to her that she had a terrible accident that robbed her of the ability to retain memories after she falls asleep each night. Christine works with a new doctor who encourages her to write a journal each day so she can revisit the memories she has developed. Inconsistencies in her story between what her doctor tells her and what her husband tells her cause her to question what is true and what might be false memories. She reads in the front of her diary in her own hand the words \\"Don't trust Ben\\". And that is all of the plot you need to know!<br />This story is really well done. It plays with your understanding of memory and subconscious thoughts much as Christopher Nolan's films Memento and Inception do. The narrator is possibly unreliable and that adds to the mystery in this tale. You are never sure what is a real memory and what might be a fabricated one and neither is the narrator. There is a real writing skill needed when Christine must retell her story each day and not leave the reader bored to tears in the telling. The author accomplishes this brilliantly with exceptionally good pacing and prose. As Christine's knowledge widens she is left unsure who she might trust, her doctor, her husband, her old friend. The story progresses from a psychological drama of an amnesiac to a full fledged suspense thriller. Up until the very last pages of the book I couldn't figure this one out. Surely will be a major motion picture made from this one! Can't wait to see what S.J.Watson writes next.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version of this story real by Orlagh Cassidy. She was a perfect voice for this novel, conveying a range of emotions from puzzlement to panic with great skill.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I was a little leary of how the movie would be, due to the cast of Charactors.  I was very impressed by the actors and the movie.  It really did follow the book unusually well and I think Matt did a nice job of portraying Mickey. Hats off to the movie!
B004LQ1XBY|5.0|Dr. House, I mean, Hugh Laurie has put together a wonderful Blues cd.  I play it all the time.    It is a tribute in so many ways to the best of New Orleans' tradition and with an added flair of his own.  I love hearing him laugh when they really get into it.    Recently an admirer of his acting in House, MD, I knew he loved music and have heard him in Jeeves and Wooster as well as in A Bit of Fry and Laurie play the piano and guitar.    But this cd is something more.  It is a way out of blues, a love affair with the piano and horns; it is a celebration of life and suffering.    House fans have seen his suffering and heard a bit of his piano but this is well beyond that.    He apologizes in the liner notes that he is English and not poor.      As he says, \\"this makes me happy.  I want to be there\\" to explain he may not do more acting.  I think I understand.  (Of course things change...or is it, things(people) don't change on House.)

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I got this book because I was interested in knowing how she lived captive for 18 years. So when I first started the book I wasn't sure what to expect. After reading the chapter when he raped her I was really surprised with all the details. I was not sure if I could keep reading. I was glad that I did. I am a mother of two and I cant imagine them being taken away from me or them going through the same thing Jaycee did. I am very proud of the person she was and is still is after everything she has gone thru. I encourage everyone to read this amazing story!
B003UYUP6M|5.0|A fascinating read that dives deep into the history of Google and its founders like no other resource before it. Captivating from the start, painting a vivid picture of the behemoth and the characters behind it. This is one book you won't regret reading and will end up recommending to all your tech junkie friends.    My only quarrel, that also extends to books besides this one, is with Amazon permitting publishers to charge more for Kindle editions than the physical books. Not only is this insulting to the consumer, but it works against the Kindle, Publishers, and Amazon. I nearly didn't buy this book because of this rampant asinine practice and after seeing what I would have missed, it irks me even more.
B004LWZW24|1.0|The Exorcist, The Entity, and Poltergeist are all very important movies.  In fact, nothing proves that statement more than the dozens upon dozens of films that have aped their premises.  There's a person or a family and they're being followed by something that they can't shake, so they call an expert in the paranormal for help.  As Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell proved, it isn't impossible to create a movie using that formula and have it deliver on its promises.  Drag Me to Hell had a great cast, a clever script, and taut direction.  Insidious has only one of these things.  With a cast made up of Patrick Wilson (Hard Candy), Rose Byrne (Damages) and Barbara Hershey (loooots of stuff), I'll let you decide which of the two this movie is lacking.<br /><br />To start with, the script is bad.  I mean, really bad.  As someone who has acted in things with horrible dialogue and even written some things with horrible dialogue, I'm still surprised when I hear such wooden nonsense come out of the mouths of actual actors who have proven themselves with great performances.  They try, though.  Rose Byrne sits on her porch waiting for her husband to come home and when he arrives, one of those thoughtless \\"why are you coming home so late all of the sudden?\\" moments rears its ugly head.  The problem is, the movie is absolutely loaded with this tripe.  Of course, at one point in the film, the husband has seen something that can in no way be misconstrued, and he throws the exorcist, uh, sorry, the astral projection lady out of his house for being fraudulent.  Every single thing this movie does has been done somewhere else and has been done much better.<br /><br />That isn't to say that there aren't any good ideas in the script.  For starters, astral projection is rarely in movies, so it's interesting to see it show up in a horror film, but the concept is wasted on a simple retread of the final act of Poltergeist, except it's less visually impressive.  This leads me to my next point; thedirection.  A movie like this needs tense, gripping direction.  Instead, we get something that lacks focus. Director James Wan is not good at those things. Oftentimes, it's brutally obvious that the actors aren't even speaking to one another.  The pace often drags its heels and for too long, the movie goes through the motions of showing us the characters not doing much of anything.  That would be okay if those scenes had a point, but they don't.  They're just uninteresting.  This film definitely could have used some more liveliness all around.  Scenes that should be frightening come across as plain silly.  Oooh, there's a person walking back and forth outside.  Oooh, the door opened itself.<br /><br />Finally, when the time actually comes for something that should be visually interesting to occur, Wan shows us a house with a little bit of fog and some darkness.  That's great, the unfathomable dimension is a foggy version of the families old house.  That's not scary or clever, it's just lazy.  That's a great word to sum up this movie; lazy.  Now, before I ramble on any further, I'd like to talk about the sound design, which is so overbearing and ridiculous, all it did was make me chuckle uncomfortably.  When the audience is supposed to be scared of something, we generally see no sign of it on screen, but the score ratchets up in intensity and starts making silly Halloween noises before finally cutting off BECAUSE NOTHING HAPPENS.  Oh, my, Rose Byrne used a hockey stick to look at what is obviously a pair of shoes.  Oh my god, it WAS a pair of shoes!  Naturally, the score has to reach a crescendo when that happens, and a comical crescendo at that.  It does redundant crap like that through the whole movie, too.  We get it, it's a horror movie, now stop trying to scare people with shaky violins and false scares.<br /><br />I didn't mean to ramble, but this movie really is insanely lazy.  If you scare really easily, chances are you might like this.  If you like your movies sensical and intelligent, however, you'll probably be bored to tears by this tedious, derivative film.  I love Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, but they should seriously try signing on to less idiotic movies from now on.
0316069485|1.0|As many others have written, Reversal suffers from too much pseudo courtroom drama and lousy characterization.    To top it off, one oft-mentioned aspect of the plot (the jury must be kept unaware of the prior trial) is revealed (p. 266) as follows:  \\"...the judge explained to the jury that Royce would read questions posed by Jessup's previous defense attorney...\\".  Shortly after (p. 273):  \\"She could give no indication that there had been a previous trial...\\".      Pathetic!    I suspect that Reversal and one earlier book were actually produced by some assembly-line process.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|I saw these guys open up for Motley Crue, and they keep up the same great rock n' roll tradition of singing great songs about sex, drinking, women and the rock lifestyle.  You can definitely imagine a future for these guys playing to a sold-out stadium with 40,000 fans singing along to every song.    If you're looking for a few songs to whet your appetite, check out the following:  - Lowlife:  great song celebrating the dirt-bag lifestyle  - The Truth is.. : fun song imagining yelling at your soon-to-be-ex for all the crap you put up with, and the crap that you did in turn  - Gentlemen:  Rock song celebrating what we all know to be true, women don't like gentlemen; they like jerks like lead-singer Tyler  - Drag Me to Hell:  The hardest and heaviest song, really shows off some of their guitar chops.  It's going to be great live.  - What was I thinking:  Rock ballad about the rock lifestyle    I can understand some of the criticisms about how there are lots of ballads, but these are still great hard-rock ballads.  Get the Special Edition Explicit Mp3 version of the album, which has 18 songs.  18 songs!     If you loved Scars & Souvenirs, you're going to love this one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A good finish for this trilogy. The poor young heros of this book are beaten to a pulp again, and again, and again but manage to hang in there for the outcome you can't see coming. I liked the series, it was well written and consistently good throughout.
0316098329|5.0|Ma and Jack's whole world is Room, an eleven-foot square enclosure that is their life.  Everyday is spent with Ma trying to give her son Jack a normal life...playing games, watching TV, taking baths, and eating the dreaded vegetables.  But Ma and Jack's life is anything but normal.  Abducted seven years earlier, Ma has been forced to raise her child in horrific captivity, totally reliant on the man who imprisoned her to keep both her and her son alive.  Nonetheless, she holds out hope that she may one day escape her dungeon and give her son a life where walking on grass, eating ice cream and visiting family are commonplace events.    Emma Donoghue's Room is a shockingly poignant tale of coping with the unimaginable...being abducted and held in captivity for years on end.  Jack becomes Ma's reason for survival...the reason to get up each day and hope that she may find a way to escape.  Donoghue's excruciating details of Room -- the cramped enclosure where Ma and Jack are kept -- lends a realism to a situation which I hope I, or anyone else, would never have to face.  But somehow, above all, Ma creates a semblance of a life for her and her son Jack, one which not only provides a something-close-to-normal life for them both, but also give her hope that she may, at some point, escape her abductor's clutches.    I simply can't recommend Room enough.  In a world where these sorts of crimes happen all too often to way too many people, Room lifts the blinds on a world you would never ever want to visit, but, after you have completed the book, somehow, wish you could visit again...at least in some small way.
B00005JKGZ|1.0|I'm reviewing Amazon practice on selling this and other movies. Today, July 14, 2011, Amazon had this title listed as a Gold Box special for $10.92. Click on that same Gold Box title and see a price of $8.07. I have contacted Amazon on similar Gold Box items and have not received straight answers. Amazon has also expanded the procedure of selling DVD-R's as DVD's. DON'T TRUST AMAZON until they stop these practices. I'm sure there are many other problems I haven't spotted as yet.    I used to have a much higher opinion of Amazon and promoted it to friends. Not so much anymore.
1416550550|5.0|The story of a little girl who is left on a ship to Austraila begins this lovely take of love, loyalty, hardship,  struggle and mystery.   At the age of 21, she is told the truth about her family and begins a quest for her origins that leads her to a large estate in England.  The author tells the reader the story through the experiences of the main characters in different times.  This movement of the story through the different time frames, helps to build suspense and also understanding for the reader.  This was a rare book that caused me to step into the story and lose myself in it. I have also read the other Kate Morton books, The House at Riverton, and The Distant Hours, but this book is the best by far, in my opinion.  The author's writing style is easy and the plot moves quickly. I do recommend all three, but this was my favorite.

B001HNE3NO|3.0|It has some great sections but overall was a bit lacking.  For instance the story of 'sarah's key' is resolved half way through the book.
0385341008|2.0|I had high hopes for this book based on the reviews, but it didn't do it for me.  There was no plot.  More accurately, there were many plots, all tied for first place.  The characters were one dimensional.  One of the minor characters, Isola, was the only one who came to life for me.  The head bump reading bit was very amusing.<br /><br />This book was obviously a labor of love and the writing style is of good quality; however, I got the feeling that the author was well-read, not well-lived.  Perhaps someone who read about the horrors of war but never lived through one.  Someone who read about great romance, but never experienced one.  Someone who witnessed child-rearing, but never raised one.  Someone who read great novels, but never wrote one.
0061998494|4.0|I´m a huge fan,that´s probably the worst thing about reading this book. But let´s be fair, Ferguson´s narrative about his life in scotland and the recent americanism is a great reading for those who admire him but also a pretty interesting and jouyfull for those who only relate him with a night show.  Ferguson is a groundbreaking and insolent host, he talks about everything and tries to push the envelope almost in every show, but as a writer, he´s an emotive and detailed narrator who likes people being near his life history.  On the other part it´s a book writen by a T.V. host so we can´t expect David Foster Wallace o Chuck Klosterman, but, he´s no motivational speaker or business councelor, so, the book worths every penny you pay for it.

B003ODL004|1.0|Some things to get out of the way: at no point is this soundtrack unpleasant to listen to. In fact, it's very listenable. But there are just too many extreme annoyances for me to give it anything more than one star in good conscience.    I want to preface this by saying that Hans Zimmer is by no means a talentless composer. That man's work on The Lion King speaks for itself. However, he's succumbed to a kind of creative laziness in the last ten years or so, switching to the equivalent of techno with deep tones.    This is a prime example of that tendency.    While never unpleasant, this soundtrack is absurdly, ABSURDLY repetitive. You could sample about four minutes of this - probably less, in fact - and just loop it, and you'd have the equivalent.    (Isn't there a good reason the term \\"one-note\\" means what it does in English?)    There is simply no complexity here. There are about three themes - yes, inspired by the Edith Piaf song, that was indeed a good idea - but there is no musical identity for any of the characters. The few themes introduced at the film's beginning are just present there at the end, with no development.    And if you're still skeptical, honestly, honestly answer me this: would you yourself be totally incapable of even approaching this kind of sound, given a basic knowledge of music theory and a couple of synthesizers?    The answer is no, and the proof is in the SEVERAL fan-made soundtracks on YouTube that equal, if not surpass, this soundtrack in both beauty and complexity.    Inception was a great and intricate film. But to equate the soundtrack to the movie is to garnish a candlelight dinner with mayonnaise.
B000Q6GX8Q|5.0|The last time I saw Casablanca it was in the historic Tennessee theater in Knoxville and that was some twenty plus years ago.  When I first noticed the blu ray edition I snatched it right up.  I was not disappointed.  The audio and video transfers  are immaculate and as good as any theatrical showing.  I also purchased [[ASIN:B0020MMRC0 The Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B001CC7PQ2 Touch Of Evil (50th Anniversary Edition)]] and on Sept. 13 I will be eagerly awaiting the arrival of [[ASIN:B001PIHH5M Citizen Kane (Amazon Exclusive 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition + The Magnificent Ambersons on DVD) [Blu-ray]]].    There is nothing more to say about the film itself because hey, this is Casablanca.
B003REEPJS|2.0|The sample for I can't be Tamed doesn't do any justice for the song. Go on youtube and see the music video. My daughter doesn't like Miley and says she counted around 47 inappropriate dance moves, costumes, and lyrics. (not including backround dancers!)
0061784788|5.0|After waiting for over a year and a half for my preordered copy of \\"The Devil Colony\\" by James Rollins to be finished and delivered I can say I was not disappointed.  The novel is one more installment of the Sigma Force series.  The combination of factual information along with Rollins imagination has been blended into a fast paced and intriguing novel.  The suspense and curiosity of where Rollins was taking this story kept it a page turner.<br /><br />The opening scenario of the novel sets the stage with an excavation of a Native American burial mound taking place in Kentucky in 1779 authorized by then governor of Virginia Thomas Jefferson.  At this dig a monster's skull is unearthed containing gold plates inscribed with a map.<br /><br />The novel then brings us to the present day Utah where archeologists are removing an ancient Native American Artifact from a cave kept secret by the Ute tribes.  Upon removal the artifact is exposed to a waiting crowd of reporters triggering an explosion releasing thousands of self replicating destructive nanobots.  In the words of the author they begin \\"Denaturing\\" the environment and humans into dust.<br /><br />The Sigma Special Forces Unit, headed by Painter Crowe, are called in to investigate and the action is ratcheted up when his team finds out this may be the first of more explosions that threaten to destroy life on earth.  It is soon uncovered that the secretive order known as the Guild may be behind the explosions and a conspiracy going back to the founding of the United States.<br /><br />\\"The Devil Colony\\" is a success in my opinion because I enjoyed reading it and felt it was satisfyingly entertaining.  It was one of those novels where every chance I had I picked it up and read some more.  I give it 5 stars.
B004ZGM76A|5.0|Many give this movie a bad review, but that's because they expect something very different to what is, do not expect a memorable story, but if you are fan of Japanese anime, I like the scenes of compatible, swords, guns, nazi's, futuristic, video games, zombies, this movie is all, and more
159514188X|1.0|i suppose some people will like this book but i kept finding myself being annoyed with how the author wrote and i really hated how WHINEY THE MAIN CHARACTER IS. he's all \\"Why me? Why did she choose me? Why did she kill herself? I had nothing to do with it. Why does my life suck so much, because it's not perfect? I'm whiney, let me complain some more.\\" I found no joy in this book (i understand it's not a happy book and i think there are some great depressing books) and i didn't find 1 let alone 13 reasons why this book should be deemed a good read. That is all.
B004RLEBTY|5.0|Mastodon? Yes. Melvins? Very much so. If you like the Melvins, Mastodon, Big Business, Dozer, Kylesa... rock in general?!! then this album is for you! Which it is for me. This album is nothing like their first. Not a bad thing whatsoever! I hate repetition myself. While their sound is very much still Red Fang, this one is totally different from the first. 5+ stars!! My favorite band right now, buy it!!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I respect everyones opinions on why they don't like the remastered versions or the prequels because they have good reason to do so. Han's really shot first, they replaced the original ghost vader with hayden cristensen and Jar Jar is the most rediculous thing iv'e ever seen, but it's still star wars and we all love it. plus at 90 dollars were really gettin half price. new Blu ray movies cost around thirty dollars a piece and were gettin 30 hours of bonus features so theres really no reason to complain. If someones gonna post a comment on Amazon whining about the price just don't buy it.
159420229X|5.0|This book delivers an entertaining mix of personal experiences, history and \\"journalism\\" about the fascinating world of memory experts, and even some real investigative reporting regarding the so-called \\"savant\\" Daniel Tammet. Most important for our society are the points the author makes about how education has declined in tandem with the elimination of most memorization of material.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have criticized the light coverage of the actual techniques used to perform these feats of memory, but the author gives enough of them to get quite a ways, in my view. I didn't buy it as a manual and felt it was money well spent for the overall reading experience.<br /><br />By purchasing one memory technique manual the interested reader will be able to access everything he needs to do what the author did. I have personal experience with [[ASIN:0345410025 The Memory Book: The Classic Guide to Improving Your Memory at Work, at School, and at Play]] but there are many others as good.<br /><br />Be warned though, no book can substitute for practice. Reading this one will not make you a memory expert. It may make you just a tiny bit smarter.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Prince is a musical genius in every sense of the word. Over the years, he's proven to be more than a songwriter and musician, Prince is indeen an artist. \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is a fine example of the musical range and studio artistry, that not many others are able to produce. Now, I have read many of the other reviews and most of them, comment on Prince's conversion to Jehovah's Witnesses and the material that is directly related to his choice of spiritual worship. This is a music review and that is what I'm writing about...the music. I am a spiritual individual as well (although I am not a Jehovah's Witness and frankly disagree with most of their teachings), but I am rating this album on the quality of the music more than the lyrical content. I admire Prince as a performer and musician and although I may not agree with some of the lyrical content, I will defend the brother's right to say what he believes. \\"The Rainbow Children\\" is filled with some of the FUNKiest jazz arrangments, that I've heard by any musician prior to the release of this album. Now it's time to name, some names...\\"Muse 2 The Pharaoh\\", \\"She Loves Me 4 Me\\", \\"The Sensual Everafter\\", \\"Digital Garden\\", \\"Mellow\\" and \\"The Everlasting Now\\" are my favorite tracks, but honestly the entire album is worth listening to, for anyone who appreciates good music. On the other hand, if you are someone who is offended, by someone else's belief in GOD and/or reference's to any other spiritual beings (got a problem with Muhammed or Buddah?) you would probably find yourself too overcome by your own 'intelligence', to appreciate the music.
B004Y1USJE|3.0|Having been a fan of all things Yes for 40 years, I wanted to give this album a shot.  I even like \\"Drama\\" quite a bit.  However, on \\"Fly From Here\\" I've tried really hard, listening to it several times, and the only thought I can really come up with is \\"meh...\\"  Not great, not bad, not Yes.    I agree with the reviewer who said the effort is \\"pretty much void of emotion and real creativity, especially the lyrics.\\"  Benoît David is a good singer, the kind you hear in hundreds of average bands, providing a voice but not an organic presence to the band.    I saw Jon Anderson's solo acoustic show in Seattle this week and was blown away.  Having low expectations, thinking his 67 year-old voice would be weak from his past illness, I could not have been more surprised by the perfect, unique voice of Yes filling the room.  The recurring thought that I had as I left the concert was, \\"What were they (Squire, White and Howe) thinking?\\"  I also listened yesterday to Yes' last album, \\"Magnification\\" and even though it didn't sell well, it is 100 times better musically and lyrically.    For those who will say, \\"Get over it. This is Yes now. Move on,\\"  I say, YOU move on with your pseudo-Yes.  Personally I can't wait to hear Anderson-Wakeman-Rabin next year.  And like ABWH, maybe it's better not to use the name Yes, when you're, um, not.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this application. In fact, its my favorite download so far.  i found a great book right away and Im into it!  The controls and settings are easy to access and it always has my place saved.  Its portable and its free, I cant see how it can get much better than that!    I cant wait to start my next book on my android! I always have my phone and therefore I always have a book!    Thank you Thank You Thank you!  highly recommend downloading this and giving it a shot.    My favorite thing:  Putting my baby down to sleep I have to keep the room silent, and dark. I like to hang around when he goes to bed because hes teething and wakes up in pain fairly often. when I put him to sleep, I roll over and whip out my phone and read a book on my phone until Im tired, its like stealing some adult time and still being an attentive mom!
1933633867|5.0|Everyone talks about debt but I can't think of anyone else who has so deeply explored its role in our history and culture. This book goes FAR beyond a discussion of debt issues in contemporary capitalistic society (thought it does plenty of that too). Graeber has done amazing research into debt's role in religion, revolutions, and political power systems across cultures and throughout history, and he has come up with surprising, counter-intuitive, and provocative results. This book will completely change the way you think about economics, morality, power systems, philosophy, and money.

B004Y1USV2|5.0|We can fly from Here...    Very YES and epic which reminds me of Close to the Edge.    The First Track is just very Cinema and Cutting it Fine and with that Relayer Feel. Oh Man I love It.    The more I listen to it the more it really feels like the successor of \\"the Ladder\\" which was a great record.     The product is really good. I can hear everything. I can hear Geoff's piano on the last track and it carries a beautiful melody. I can even hear Steve's Mandolin on track 4.  They have not been drowned in the recording process.    Great Job Trevor Horn!!!!!!!!!!    Track 7 and 8 at the end very Jon Anderson-ish Love it. It's a tribute to Jon! Very Much like the Ladder.     Alan wonderful playing! It was almost like keyboard with textures as well as very Sonic.    Benoit you really have your own sounds and you (forgive me) have a Trevor Horn/Jon Anderson quality to your voice but so different. Excellent job!    Track 8 has a Pink Floyd feel to it but then it becomes more beautiful and expands. It has a bit of \\"Changes\\" in it. After 2 minutes it hits a very Relayer and Awaken and also a And You and I feel and really captures YES. Here at the end of this track it reminds me a little of Drama (I love Drama).     Some critiqued that Yes repeating \\"Riding a Tiger\\" was not Yes but \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\" is repeating \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\". Si?    Track 3 and Track 4 has Geoff playing some very good keyboards very classic Yes. Wonderful!    In conclusion it captures the 70's in a polished 90125 feel.   Very nice record also it has those elements of YES that make your soul soar.  I love it!  I disagree that the 5 part Fly From Here is not a cohesive concept it is.    The record is very thematic and epic.     I also like very much Oliver Wakeman's parts. Tracks 1, 5 and a favorite of mine Hour of Need which has a beautiful And You I feel.    The record... \\"Sink or Swim\\"?     It will let you Fly From Here!!!!!!!!
B004LROMSO|1.0|I majored in history in College, and even studied Medieval history at Cambridge one summer...but Starz's Camelot is just plain awful.  I went into the season open minded, meaning that I was ready for another version of the king Arthur legend since I liked Excalibur and several other versions; however, please note that even I couldn't ever like First Knight.  I don't want to give away too many details if you want to watch the series, but be forewarned it sucks due to miscast, poor script,small budget (needed more extras as warrior knights and common folk) and political correctness (modern feminism, multi-cultural/post-racial, etc.).  It also smacks of hollywood trying to ride the ambiguity fence...that the characters are neither good nor evil, lies somewhere near the gray area of fallibility etc soap opera.  Where are the knights trained in combat arms of the day (heavy cavalry)?   They must have spent the whole budget on a few talent and camelot castle CGI because Camelot lacked in depth in many ways.        The opening scene of young Arthur caught after sleeping with his brother's girlfriend...was just wrong.  I don't believe that would have occurred back then, but note that it was more revealing of Arthur's character later in the series.  Merlin (Joseph Fiennes) was absolutely believable and Fiennes gave an amazing portrayal of a cunning yet \\"might-be-mad\\" sorcerer.  King Uther's sorceress daughter Morgan (Eva Green) was brilliantly played and deserves recognition.  Arthur's knights seemed like real men yet too \\"clean\\" and not like the battle-tested rustic knights like Templar Knight James Purfoy from the movie \\"Ironclad\\".  (and a black-african knight? in England?  New one for me.)  With Jamie Campbell Bower as King Arthur???  One of the biggest miscasts ever.  Between his bad acting and his wimpy looks (trained to carry a sword? morelike a bow perhaps), he does not fit the king arther role.  So, he's a ladies man, I get it...better role as a bard than a man fit to rule England.     I liked the creativeness of how the sword in the stone and lady of the lake became legend, but anything recognizeable stops there (the potential arthur/morgana season finale hookup that produced an offspring that never occurred).  Camelot quickly turned into a soap opera with the bitter evil nun advisor, mixed asian/black-african maid (they never developed her charater), and Egraine plot that just turned south.  Poor character development of Arthur's knights and other characters.     Camelot the musical was more believeable than this nonsense.  Buy that version and save your money on this one.  Like my review or not, it just wasn't worth my breath.
B004Q7E0TA|4.0|I read this book in one night, in one sitting. I'm sure I partly was drawn to it because she is a celebrity who is married to another celebrity, and because she is  in a gay marriage. There aren't a lot of books dedicated to those subjects put together. The dust jacket excerpt that she had gotten down to 82 lbs was something that drew me  in also, showing how deeply ill she'd gotten. Interestingly, there wasn't discussion in the book about how heart failure often occurs when anorexics reach that  low of a weight. There were a few times reading her book where I wondered if her judgements about other people, particularly overweight people/women, were simply   judgements she had at that time, and does she still think that way? or has that passed away now that she is recovered?     The epilogue was very interesting and I think it could have been expanded, more details about how she recovered and more details  about how she remains recovered. There is no indication that she could remain at risk. But I think many who struggle and \\"recover\\" from  eating disorders remain at risk.     Four stars because I couldn't put it down, and because I do think a woman in her position does have to risk a lot to  publish a book like this. I never read Brooke Shields' book about her depression, but I expect it was similarly courageous.  As far as whether it will help a lot of people, as her wife Ellen says it will, I wonder. I wouldn't give this book to a person  in the throes of the disorder. I know someone who dealt with this disorder and I don't believe it would be helpful until the person  is fully recovered, and I'm not so sure how it can help a person recognize they need to change, that they need to give it up.  That usually requires some kind of an interventio; the person who is sick can't find their way out very often.     SPOILER Alert:    The reasons she gives for her recovery could be found by some readers as \\"exclusive\\" because not everyone finds people or  options such as shefound to change one's life enough in order to make a recovery. What if she'd never lived with Francesca?  She claims she was fully recovered before she began her life w/Ellen DeGeneres. (not before she met her, though)   She also has fairly good family support,something that many people with eating disorders may or may not have.   Portia says that 9/11 changed her life. What if 9/11 hadn't happened? It's not clear that just anyone will be able  to recover ...

0439023491|5.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" is the second part of the Hunger Games trilogy, so don't read this one until you've read the first novel, \\"The Hunger Games\\". This one picks up right where the first left off and is a fun and engrossing read. Some may find the first third or so of the book a little slow because it is told in summary, but once it picks up it moves at a very quick pace and is hard to put down.<br /><br />The Hunger Games series is very similar in spirit to Orwell's \\"1984\\", but it isn't quite up there with that classic. I'm a reader in my late twenties and I really enjoyed this book (I wasn't expecting to get so caught up in it because of its \\"young adult\\" status). If you liked the first novel, you will like \\"Catching Fire\\". It's basically more of the same, with stakes raised and new plot twists and turns. The only criticism I can level at it is that maybe it's too brief. There is so much imagination here that I feel like we should learn more about the arena and the world in which it is set.<br /><br />Now you'll have to excuse me while I go and start reading the last book in the series, \\"Mockingjay\\"!

I now realize she didnt need my help. her accomplishments are her own. her story was enlightning and empowering and inspiring.

B002ZG99OK|4.0|I thought it was ok. A light romantic comedy. Suitable for kids. I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, but the kids wanted to watch this movie, so I went along. I did expect a bit more of it, it was quite predicable, but it was entertaining. And the kids liked it. Talking animals always seem to have magical effect on kids, and ... it was fun.
0743496736|4.0|I really liked the plot, and how it simultaneously combined the views of the shooter, the victims, their families and friends, the shooter's friends, and people who only heard about it. I also liked the flashbacks to everything leading up to the shooting. It's the time after the shooting that kind of lost me. Josie acts like she doesn't remember anything, then admits a huge secret, then apparently nothing happens to her? That was weird. I also wish they'd focused more on Peter after the shooting and left out some of the mostly unrelated information, like the judge's relationship with the detective or information about the lawyer's kids. The shooter's parents were fascinating. Overall a good read, though not much of a feel-good novel.
B00466HM28|5.0|This is an excellent little midi controller. Everything about it has a nice high quality feel to it, even though it's on the lower end of the spectrum price-wise for similar products. Akai is known for making high quality professional full-size midi controllers and keyboards, and they definitely have brought that level of quality down to this MPK mini.    It's a smaller midi controller; meant to be used in a small studio or as a portable midi to use with a laptop on the go.    My only real \\"con\\" would have to be the toughness on the MPC pads. While they can measure velocity, which is fantastic, they're a hard rubber which makes consistent harder presses more difficult to do. When it comes to actually making a beat though, hitting it hard enough isn't so much a problem if you're really getting into what you're doing. Hitting it hard enough can also sound a bit loud, but if you're wearing some studio monitor headphones, you wont even notice.    Overall, this is a fantastic midi controller, and I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I'd definitely purchase from Akai again in the future.
159514188X|5.0|When I purchased this book, I hadn't read any reviews on it. I picked it up because it was on a friend's TBR list and I figured, since we had the same taste in books I would see what it was about. Whenever I pick up an older book (pre 2010) I refuse to check out any other reviews; I want all impressions to be my own and I don't want any one to influence my thoughts on the book.<br />Let me just say.... this book is a powerful one! I was a little confused at first, but quickly found out what was going on and I couldn't put the book down! I felt as though I was there with Clay listening to Hannah give her reasons.<br />Let me give you a little about the book before I go any further.. otherwise you might not see why I loved it so much.<br />We start off with Clay at the post office, he's mailing off a package wrapped in plain brown paper with no return address...Yeah, kinda confused me at first...Then we get brought back to the previous day to Clay arriving home to a similar package. Inside we find that there are 7 cassette tapes ( I know what you are thinking..cassette tapes?, yeah my thoughts exactly). The tapes are numbered 1-13, and feature the voice of Hannah; a classmate and crush of Clay's that has apparently committed suicide. Yes, SUICIDE!!<br />Not what I was expecting at all, but this got me more invested in the book. Not often do you find books written about this subject, even though it is a subject that needs to be talked about more.<br />Hannah goes on to tell us her reasons for choosing suicide, via these 7 cassette tapes. You learn that even though Hannah was the new kid, she was stronger than most for a long time. A couple of weeks was all it took for everything in Hannah's life to snowball out of control. Some of us may not realize that one simple thing, be it a rumor; a passing comment; or even a silly little high school list; can totally change the lives of not just one person, but many.<br />The things that happen in the book are eventually all connected, and that is the power behind this book. We may think that the off handed comment we said to the girl from second period didn't matter, but who's to say what may come of that comment? Who's to say that you didn't just change the path of someone's life?<br />Thirteen Reasons Why really makes you think back to how you have treated others. Has something you said or repeated snowballed into something so much bigger than you? Can you really say that you know how everything you have said and done has affected those around you?<br />We learn through Hannah, and even Clay; that while you may not be directly involved...You are ultimately involved in everything you are around.... Yes, you may not have written up that list, but you read it and passed it along...You may not have been driving the car that caused a wreck, but you helped those people, and you went to school with those that were involved; even if they never actually hit anyone.<br />Asher has written a compelling story, and drew me in from the beginning. I couldn't walk away from Hannah and her story...I cried throughout most of the book, and when Clay finds out just why he is on the list, it broke my heart. This is one book that I am PROUD to have on my shelves!e power behind this book.

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I still cannot wrap my mind around an 11 year old girl going through this.  I try to imagine my girls at that age and it seems impossible someone would do this to a little child, but he did. I also cannot imagine her mothers pain and worry throughout the years not knowing what happened to Jaycee. This is not something I want my daughters to read even though they are in their 20's.  It's a true monster story.  I wish this lady luck and her daughters too. Thank you God for all your blessings on me so that I and my daughters did not have this happen to us and I am very sorry that this happened to her and many other families.

1451629184|5.0|I pre-ordered Jaycee's book \\"A Stolen Life\\" for my Kindle. It arrived Tuesday morning and I read several chapters to begin with;  And that evening when I sat down to read on...I couldn't wait to read the end chapters to see how she is doing reuniting with her family and the world around her.  What a blessing to see the people that have come into her life to give her guidance, love and support.  I think she released so much from herself and will truly helping others experiencing similar situations in writing her words.   [[ASIN:B004ZZS4CC A Stolen Life]]
0545265355|5.0|I didn't know what to really expect from this series, but I was pleasantly surprised! It has such a strong, female lead Katniss Everdeen.  I truly enjoyed every book in this series. Character development was great, I really got attached to them.Peeta was definitely my favorite character, he started out so quiet, but became such a strong voice by the end of the series. I feel like Suzanne Collins has realized a story that could one day happen, if humans don't learn how to respect each other better!
B00127RAJY|2.0|NOT a well-planned 20 minute workout!!!      I have done aerobics/workouts since 1983.  Having done the Original 20-Minute Workout in the Eighties, plus updated Low Impact, Step Classes, Cardio/Strengthening Alternates, etc., I am pretty experienced.  Also, I have taken classes over the years at various gym clubs etc.    This video, will NOT CREATE RESULTS as suggested.!      Reasons why:    1.  Movements/Actions are disjointed, and do NOT smoothly transition from one level or exercise to the next.    2.  Not enough sustained heart-pumping aerobics - to quickly SHED FAT FAST. (If you want to get in shape FAST -BURN FAT!!!!) Weights help too - for firmness - but do not \\"shed\\" fat - you need straightforward aerobics.    3.  Not fun, quite onerous, and too much talking!  (She isn't engaging enough.)    4.  Ms. Michaels just isn't fun to watch, and not enough action propels the exercises forward - to keep interest and energy levels up!      (For these Reasons:  This is NOT A GOOD VIDEO FOR THOSE LOOKING TO \\"SHRED\\" in 30 DAYS.  Get Jane Fonda, Kathy Smith or BEST -The Original 20-Minute workout  - do these twice a day (once in morning before eating, then in evening) for even 3 or 4 weeks and you will see HUGE RESULTS!  and FAST.  If any exercises are too strenuous, do a modified version during the video - but keep moving.)      BEST WORKOUTS/INSTRUCTORS:    Watch Jane Fonda, Kathy Smith, and the Canadian 20-minute workout -- to see how one action -- SMOOTHLY TRANSITIONS TO THE NEXT. This prevents injury, and keeps the pace going.  (You don't all of a sudden just start jumping jacks!  Then, All of a sudden stand up, then straight to the floor - then up standing again.  This can create injury, and cause fainting/dizziness.  VERY POOR!!!    Jillian Michaels has missed it.  Don't Buy!

B00000055E|4.0|This is one of 2pacs best albums, or maybe his best.  I used to have this more than 10 years ago, and was happy to hear it again.
0307277887|4.0|This was a great book. I love the TV series and was told the books were just as good. I have to agree. It is awsome to get into a monsters head and hear how he thinks. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the Dexter books!
B004LROMX4|4.0|Falling Skies is a fiction television series. For TNT. The first season has 10 episodes. The show  tells the story of the aftermath of an alien invasion. The show follows Tom  a Boston University history professor, who is one of the leaders of the 2nd Mass, a group of survivors fighting against the aliens. Tom, is  in search of his missing son, as well as put his extensive knowledge of military history into practice to help resistance fighters and protect survivors. Most  of the human race has been distroyed,  Tom and his other  two  sons, Hal and Matt are with him and wants to find their missing brother as well. Tom and the other soliders must learn to survive  the alien and whatever else they encounter on the way.<br /><br />Not a bad show so far for me. I'm up to  the 3rd episode and found the show to be to my liking. I thing sci fi shows are better watched on cable as they tend to do better there in most cases. Great cast and visual, surely since it's cable I wanted to see what the special effects would look like and it isn't bad, I can tolerate it. I look forward to more episodes and hope it won't be cancel soon. I'm glad to see Noah Wyle back on tv. I think TNT treats him well I saw both his librarian movies.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is the simplest view I've seen of the complexities which caused the economic downturn.  For the first time, I understand (conceptually) credit default swaps, etc.  Ferguson does a masterful job of laying it all out visually so that it can be grasped.      You'll be stunned as you watch heads of major universities, major businesses, politicians all struggle to answer simple questions which get down to conflict of interest and ethics.  You'll also be amazed at how it has come full circle.    Regardless of your political affiliation, it's an important film.  Anyone in real estate or lending should see it asap.  Also, I think it should be required viewing for EVERY member of Congress as they stalemate on the deficit negotiations.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|To those of you who are ripping on this album...why?  How long have some of you been listening to Incubus???  If you are a true fan since SCIENCE such as myself, you should know that Incubus NEVER puts out the same thing twice.  What make Incubus a modern legend of a band is that they are constantly evolving and changing their style.  This has happened before folks.  Remember how everyone HATED Morning View because it was too \\"soft\\" after Make Yourself?  Well, now everyone regards Morning View as one of their best.  Remember how when EVERYONE learned to love Morning View and it's chill vibe, how everyone was up in arms over the really hard rock sound of ACLOTM?  Then what happened??  Everyone started to love ACLOTM and now see it as one of their best.  And guess what folks?  They've done it again.  Did you really expect every song to sound like New Skin, Pardon Me, Circles, Megalomaniac and Anna Molly???  Personally, I think this album may overtake Morning View as my favorite of theirs.  It is 100x better than Light Grenades (my least favorite album) and is musically, the most musically advanced album they've ever done.  To those people who say, \\"it's too soft and relaxed\\" again, I say HAVE YOU EVEN LISTENED TO A WHOLE INCUBUS ALBUM IN THE PAST??  ALL, yes ALL of their albums contains slower paced, chiller music....and not only is it good, but some of it is considered their best stuff.  Don't believe me, I'll show you proof:    SCIENCE  Summer Romance    Make Yourself  The Warmth  I Miss You  Drive    Morning View  Echo  11 AM  Mexico  Are you In? (one of my favs)  Aqueous Transmissions (another one of my favs)    ACLOTM  Talk Shows on Mute  Here in My Room (great song)  Southern Girl    Light Grenades  Quicksand  Love Hurts (the WORST song they've ever done)  Paper Shoes  Earth to Bella I&II    Now you all want to knock them for doing a mostly \\"chill, soft\\" album, when they've done an album like ACLOTM, which was mostly hard guitar riffs?  Both styles work well indifferent ways and for different occasions.  And for those who say that the heaviness is totally gone on this album, THINK AGAIN.  It's there, it just more subtle.  The only song where I think the guitar is completely absent is Promises, Promises.  For example, in Thieves (now one of my favorite songs by them) the guitar is constantly swooping in gradually.  In The Original, they come completely rock out the last 1.5 minutes of the song.  In Adolescence it's there in the whole song.  In, In the Company of Wolves, well, the last part of the song with the jamming is pure musical genius.  Switchblade definitely rocks, and is one of the best songs on the album.  The studio version of Surface to Air is also rocks out as well too, and definitely should have been included on the album.  Friends and Lovers has a really cool beat to it and Isadore sounds like you could have put in on Light Grenades and have it fit.      Another thing I want state is that ever since Dirk left, fans have been clamoring for a more bass driven album.  Well, here it is folks.  Ben is definitely a star of this album, and if you haven't heard it yet, go back and listen again, cause it's there (Friends and Lovers, Thieves, The Original, In the Company of Wolves, Switchblade, Adolescence and even Promises, Promises).
B004UA8D1O|4.0|Story line okay, regardless of it based on true events.  3D effects were somewhat good.  I enjoyed it to say the least.
B004SC8YH2|5.0|I was unsure of what to expect with a new CD from Christopher Cross.  I have purchased many of his albums over the years and have often been disappointed.  For some reason, I thought I'd give it 1 more try.  Well, what an excellent choice I made!  This is really a great collection of songs.. Beautiful melodies, pitch perfect vocals and harmonies and thoughtful lyrics.  Repeated listens only enhance how terrific this CD is.  I wish there was a way to push this recording to a wider awareness, a bigger audience.  To those of us who were there when \\"Ride Like the WInd' and 'Sailing' were released and for those who never heard of Christopher Cross:  everyone should know what a great album this is.  There is a review here that comments on this CD based upon listening to song samples.  The review was \\"poor.\\"  Pay no attention to that or to the rating.  This is an excellent CD.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|The GOOD<br /><br />- Wow! The music is lovely. It also inspires me to dance. It sounds exactly like the original played by ABBA.<br /><br />- The scenes are beautiful with the sea, mountain, beach, sunshine and houses on the mountain.<br /><br />- There are many hilarious scenes too. For instance, Meryl Streep was carried away while singing Mama Mia and fell through a hole. Another is where an older lady flirted with a younger, brown guy. One more is where multiple guys dancing on the pier with their diving fins.<br /><br />- Out of 18 songs in this movie, I love 13 of them. They are: Honey Honey, Money, Mama Mia, Chiquitita, Dancing Queen, Lay All Your Love on Me, Super Trouper, Vouler Vous, SOS, The Winner Takes It All, When All Is Said and Done, Take a Chance on Me, I Have a Dream.<br /><br />- According to boxofficemojo dot com, its production Budget was $52 million.<br />Domestic gross:  $144,130,063<br />+ Foreign gross  $465,711,574<br />= Worldwide gross $609,841,637<br /><br />So it's profit was more than 10 times its cost.<br /><br />The NOT SO GOOD<br /><br />- Some of the songs are incomplete or interrupted with dialogues. This is really annoying because I need to listen to the whole song to completely enjoy it. For example, in the scene of Chiquitita song, the last sentence was omitted. It's replaced with the dialogues between Meryl Streep and her two girlfriends. The director should have the song completely sung before continuing with the actors' conversation.<br />Another is in the scene of Gimme Gimme song. It is broken into 3 pieces by the actors' conversation. That makes it much less enjoyable.<br /><br />- It does not have Karaoke version. That means there's no scene with only instrumental music. So, you have to sing along. You can't sing  Karaoke.<br /><br />- Of course, it's a musical film, so, please don't expect any logic and character development.<br /><br />Well, nothing is perfect. In short, every Karaoke fan or person who loves singing should have one copy. I'm singing along and dancing with this DVD once a month now. It's an excellent showcase of  timeless songs.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I recently received If Not Now, When?  I had no previous expectations on what type of music style they would take out.  For all of these Incubus \\"fans\\" that were disappointed, you must not have been much of a fan.  Honestly if you had even been listening to their past albums you would have known, Incubus is changing.  Maybe not for you.  Music is similar to art, its not meant to fit neatly into your preconceived notion of the artist.  Now I'm a huge fan of Incubus, an even bigger fan of SCIENCE and then Make Yourself, but I'm an Incubus fan, not a genre fan.  If you were even half a fan, you would have noted the change from years ago, Crow left to the murder anyone?  Did you honestly expect S.C.I.E.N.C.E. II?    The first run through of the album I immediately found songs that resonated with me.  If not now, when? Promises, Friends and Lovers, Adolescents, Defiance.  I definitely enjoyed these the most.  My wife and I have tickets to Incubus in Charlotte, NC.  Shes not a huge Incubus fan, however she really loved the new album.  She preferred the new sound.  I enjoyed this new album immensely, and I'm not comparing it to my love for SCIENCE era Incubus.  This album replaces the electric energy for lyrical poetry.  My wife is actually excited to see them now.  I urge Incubus fans to reconsider and to listen through the album a few times before they make a decision.  With Crow left to the murder it definitely took a couple run throughs before I really accepted the new style from all my preconceived notions.
0451169514|4.0|This book was great. However books this long must have a few uninteresting bits but it wasn't so often as to make this book bad. The \\"loser club\\" discovered something one summer when they were children. \\"IT\\" is an ancient evil whose main disguise is that of a clown that loves to eat children. If you think you were terrified of clowns before, you ain't seen nothing yet!They manage to hold it off, and eventually most of the members move away from the town, which interestingly has some sort of paranormal veil on it, they lose all memories of their terrifying event. We move on to a few decades later. Apparently one member never left town and it appears \\"IT\\" is back. It seems when they were kids they had made a pact to destroy \\"IT\\" if they were ever called back. Our members are individually forced to uncover horrifying memories, and it seems each other, as they each travel back to town. Along the way it seems as if the ancient demon is preventing them from getting there. Nostalgia hits as the characters reunite, and then the terror really begins.... The ending is really bittersweet
B0058P7KUA|5.0|UPDATE: added freeplay option. So it's definitely worth playing and to keep playing  Fun game with good graphics. There are only five levels to beat with 3 mini levels in each. The game isnt difficult at all, never had to redo a level. They should update it with different difficulties.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I REALLY LOVED THIS BOOK. IT WAS THE FINALE TO THE SERIES. IT HAD A GREAT STORY LINE, PUT A NICE ENDING BUT THE ENDING FELT TOO RUSHED. THERE OBVIOUSLY NEEDED TO BE AT LEAST A COUPLE MORE CHAPTERS TO FULLY CONCLUDE THE STORY BETWEEN PEETA AND KATNISS. AFTER READING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME I DIDNT FEEL LIKE I HAD ENOUGH STORY TO HAVE CLOSURE WITH THE BOOK....... BUT IT REALLY IS A GREAT BOOK AND THIS DID NOT STOP ME FROM READING THE WHOLE SERIES OVER AND OVER AGAIN.THATS WHY I GIVE IT 5 STARS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL THREE BOOKS.

1451629184|5.0|As I read this account of Jaycee Lee Dugard's abduction I am thinking to myself, why didnt she run? Certainly as an adult one would think Jaycee could and should have done so, right? Wrong, not so fast. I sit and think back to when I myself was 11 years old. What did I know of the world at that age and what were my thoughts at that time? In all honesty they were not much different from Jaycee Dugard's. I have to realize Jaycee never matured much beyond that age. The natural progression of time and life experience that turn most of us into fearless adults who most certainly would have figured out a way to escape was denied her. In it's place were fear and manipulation. Fear of the unknown can be a paralyzing thing. Better the devil you know. Some people indeed may have reacted differently but this is her story, this is how she endured the unendurable. This is how she is putting her life back together. I cannot judge that which I know nothing about.<br /><br />I applaude and admire Jaycee for the way she has survived the nightmare and managed to keep her children with her. Could I have done any better? Most certainly not, I could not have endured it as well.
B00406UK5A|1.0|Bad acting on top of an even worse script was painful enough.   Add in the utterly gratuitous violence and some of the worst computer-generated special effects-- seriously, I haven't seen such tacky blood-gushing scenes since the Wild Bunch made in  since the 1960s-- and you have the makings of a truly terrible film.    The Eagle was a decent enough film and if you were hoping for an inspired story of the Ninth Legion you won't find it here.   So the Scottish scenery was beautiful ... in the viewer's imagination it was left scarred and worse for the wear by this toothache of a film.
0446615625|4.0|This man David Baldacci can tell a story!  And a very good story..    Yes, this book, the first in the Camel Club series, is somewhat slow at first, but once it kicks in, once hits its stride, it is a can't-put-down book of, we hope, great fiction, plenty of political intrigue, espionage, spying on and being spied upon, treachery among friends and enemies, both foreign and domestic, and both in and out of government. At times quite a scary read,when considering the opportunity even likelihood of traitors and turncoats within our intelligence agencies...Interesting and surprising twists and turns throughout the book make it especially inviting, interesting and exciting...    At times you wonder if the good guys are going to win...that's why you keep turning and turning and turning...Do they win? What do you think? Read the book...      And meet Oliver Stone, one of our great fictionalized American heroes...
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I was never a big Harry Potter fan. I didn't read the books and only saw The Prisoner of Azkaban in theaters at the time because I was bored one weekend. So I had pretty much gone all this time without seeing the other movies in their entirety. With a screening of The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 quickly approaching, I took the initiative to watch the first seven movies over the course of a few days to be prepared and I'm very glad that I did. The movies do in fact get darker as you progress through them and seem to get better with each sequel. The one thing I didn't like was that The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix, and The Half-Blood Prince all have similar endings that just leave you hanging. One of the main characters, usually Harry, blurts out something like, \\"We're going to have to go do this,\\" and then there's this long, winding panoramic shot before the credits roll and that's it. However, watching all the movies at once had me at a bit of an advantage since there wasn't much of a wait between movies. Everyone has their favorite Harry Potter movie and I'm still a bit partial to The Prisoner of Azkaban but in my opinion both halves of The Deathly Hallows are the best in the series.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure if it was just following so close to the book or what, but The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 has an excellent sense of perspective. Hermione holding a stray hair and the scene at the bank where the guard begins to suspect Harry, Ron, and Hermione to be imposters are the prime examples that come to mind. The way it drew attention to certain items or characters through the use of those things being in-focus while everything else around them was out of focus just really made a simple scene so much more interesting. It made you try and take notice of the surroundings a bit more since they seemed to be just as important as what the main characters were going through at times.<br /><br />The special effects are extremely impressive, as well. The war at Hogwarts and Harry's battle with Voldemort are probably the most substantial scenes that come to mind while the death eaters always use some fairly eye-catching effects, but I found the white dragon to be the crown jewel of the special effects department. Most of the extravagant creatures that have played an important role in the series have generally looked the best (Buckbeak and Thestrals come to mind) compared to some of the other computer generated effects in the franchise. The white dragon in The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 just looks really spectacular though. It didn't look like it was obviously created on a computer like many computer generated effects seem to and almost came off as being flesh and bone or at least as realistic as a dragon could be.<br /><br />Does a film like this have any weaknesses? Probably, but they'll mostly go unnoticed. That's not necessarily a bad thing either. You'll be so caught up in watching this ten year event come to an end and piecing together those final pieces of the puzzle that if there is anything wrong with this finale you won't even notice. I've always felt that it always looked kind of funky whenever somebody rode a broomstick. At times it looks great and just as it should, but at others it just didn't look right. It looked a bit off in this one, but it's so brief that it should hardly even count as a nitpick.<br /><br />I feel like amongst all of the adventures you've tagged along for with Harry, Ron, and Hermione and all of the characters and creatures they've come into contact with in the span of eight films that Snape is still easily the most intriguing aspect of the entire story. His agenda is certainly something worth paying attention to and the way everything he does falls into place after you learn what you do about him in this movie is something really extraordinary. That isn't to say that other characters don't have their moments because they do, but Professor Severus Snape is that unexpected adhesive that brings allof the films together and gives the entire franchise an even greater meaning.<br /><br />Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is essentially everything you want it to be and that's more than a satisfying conclusion for all Harry Potter fans big and small.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I decided to get this dvd because it was on sale and heard really good reviews about the workouts!   Let me tell you...it is not one of those easy, fly threw workouts. Each workout is only 20-25mintues but they defentily get your heart rate up!   The moves you do are not supper hard to do but are very effective and she pretty much gives you no time to rest which i actually like. The reason why is because if i am only gonna workout for 25mins then by the time i am done i want to feel as if i did for an hour or so. (and trust me you do) if your looking for a great workout and lose weight then this is defentily a video you should get. If you want a light and easy workout then you might want to find another video.  UPDATE: I did this dvd earlier tonight and i realized that the first workout is around 25min (its only suppost to be 20) and the 2nd workout is 27 min (and that workout is only suppost to be 20 mins also) so as long as you have around 30 mins. then great! also i do wish she did a little less strangth (i dont rly lk strength but need it) and more of abs. but i still think this dvd is an AMAZING workout! enjoy!
B004WJRFYE|2.0|From the outset I'd like to say, emphatically, that my problem is not with the contents of this album.  It not only contains some very interesting McCartney music, it conjures memories of a very exciting time as a young Beatle fan: the anticipation of a solo album by one of the two main songwriting Beatles.  Enough said on that.    While the CD counterpart of this re-issue is quite good, this vinyl release-like it's predecessor, Band On The Run-is a major disappointment.  As a remaster, there is barely any difference at all from the original vinyl release (my original copy happens to be in mint condition hence, I'm able to make a very fair comparison between the two).    The primary disappointment, however, is with the vinyl pressing itself.  Here's one for the irony files:  my original pressing has next to no pops and clicks whatsoever while this brand spanking new re-issue is full of them-as is my 180g of Band On The Run.    Now we get to the packaging;  a very attractive cover package in and of itself but, unfortunately, not a very practical one.  Again, as with BOTR, the paper grade utilized for the jacket is too thin to house a heavy vinyl, double album set.      Secondly, pulling the albums/inner sleeves out of the jacket is quite an ordeal;  the fit is so tight that you have to endlessly rock the record back and forth in order to pull the thing out of the cover.  Taking the record itself out of the sleeve is just as painful.  Again, to due an overly tight fit, one ends up soiling the edges of the disc in the effort to take it out.    These are not minor complaints.  They completely take away from the pleasure of the \\"vinyl experience\\".  Perhaps the people over at Hear Music/Concord/Starbucks don't have too much knowledge or care on the subject.  There are very specific reasons as to why some of us still love the vinyl medium.  Thank goodness there are a handfull of classic album re-issue companies who, indeed, have an understanding of what it's \\"all about\\".Hear Music is very clearly not one of them.      Hopefully, Paul's current label will get enough complaints which will serve  as incentive to improve their product.  In past interviews, Paul has stated how, as a child, he used to save his pennies to buy a quality record by his favorite artists of the day.      Times haven't changed much, Paul.  For those of us who have lived our lives through your music, it's just as important to purchase that quality record; and if you're a completist such as myself wanting all configurations available, it's just as hard saving those pennies. I hope SOMEONE is listening.
1881273873|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me at a time in my life where I needed guidance post a painful break up.  Reading this book and thinking through the post chapter questions really helped me learn a lot about myself and how I receive and give love.  Gary Chapman creates awareness in an encouraging way to help his readers process the truths he presents.  I believe this book is good for EVERYONE.  Knowing how to love and receive love is so vital in EVERY relationship, not just romantic relationships.  Read it.  It will bless you.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|I was really excited to pick up this CD. I had been waiting for it to come out since 2005. After picking up the 2004 remix and remaster. After hearing that version of the album. I thought that remix remaster job sucked most of the life out of the albums sound. I had this outlook on the remaster before hearing the original CD or vinyl record mind you.      I own two copies of the original CD,2004 remix and remaster, and vinyl record re-issue. Hearing the new remaster of this album was truly mind blowing. I felt like I had heard this album for the first time I have some very nice garbage picked speakers to hear this album on. Was so glad the loudness war did not ruin this album again. Everything in the mix sounds louder and much more crisp. The remaster job was done so well you can sit back close your eyes with a beer and smoke and imagine the band is right there playing in your living room or wherever you are playing the CD.      Cannot comment much on the live CD. From what I heard here it sounds like the band was giving the performance their all. Will get around to listening to it. The live CD is a nice touch.      The liner notes are pretty good. Wanting some detailed producer liner notes.Maybe some detail as to what work went into remastering the album. Lars bit in the liner notes is a good read. I find it great that Metallica and Dave were able to mend their friendship and play at The Big Four.      Starting to babble on. This is a must own 2 CD set for a new or die hard Megadeth fan. This set will not let you down. Listen to this album and crank it.

B004Y1USV2|3.0|I've always loved Yes. Grew up in the 70s idolizing the band, especially Steve Howe, and even enjoyed the later Drama phase, minus Anderson, in its own way. In fact, I've bought every Yes album released and still enjoy many of them from time to time. The period from 'The Yes Album' to 'Going for the One' remains my favorite, but I've found something to like on every album since. Listening to a new Yes album was often both exhilarating and challenging, with repeated listens necessary for the beautifully complex musical forms to fully bloom and engage. That was the hidden joy of progressive music and half the fun. What a rush.<br /><br />But times change. If I'd never heard of the current band, I'd say that the music's certainly more interesting and accomplished than most contemporary rock hitting the waves. And there's some solid musicianship here, too, especially Steve's acoustic work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when compared to some of the other progressive (symphonic) rock coming out these days, especially from northern Europe, this release sounds surprisingly simplistic and tame to me. A few listens and time to move on. In contrast, the Flower Kings' most recent ('Sum of No Evil') is just one example of current prog-rock that both maintains and expands the genre in fresh, inspiring, even challenging ways. For me, sadly, 'Fly From Here' doesn't even come close.<br /><br />I wish the guys well, though, and expect that they'll find an audience to connect with their current offering. After all, with 40-odd years of Yes in all its varieties, Yes fans differ greatly. 'Fly From Here' is a recording that seems sure to highlight those differences. The good news for classic-prog fans like me is that other contemporary groups, like the Kings, are stepping up to fill the void. Head over to the 'progarchives' site and such to check out some great options that, IMO, far exceed 'FFH's' ability to tug at the beautiful memories of Yes' golden progressive era.<br /><br />But we'reall Yes fans here, aren't we? I guess in the end it's just a matter of discovering what Yes means to each of us and choosing Yes music accordingly. Not a bad legacy at all for a band that has given so many of us such great joy through the years.
0307887960|5.0|I only got the book to prove the diet could not work.  I changed EVERYTHING I have ever done related to exercise and eating.  I stopped biking and running a total of 1 hr 5-6 days a wk.  I did just the mandatory 20 minute walk.  I would eat complete protien meals at 12midnight knowing I had to be gaining wt.  After 5 days I lost 6 pounds after 14 days 12 pounds.  My mother lost 10 pounds in 5 days without evening walking.  IT'S AMAZING and strongly recommended
B001UOVP1S|4.0|I recently heard the song completely by accident, so I didn't first listen to the song with all the baggage that alot of the other posters seem to be carrying, in fact I didn't even know who the hell it was when I first heard it.   Seems like most people here feel if he isn't singing for Soundgarden then everything else he has done is crap.  I couldn't care less.  I think that Scream is one of his best songs.............
6302763835|5.0|The product(Tarantula) was described correctly and upon receipt it was exactly as advertised. Took me back to 1955 and the 25ct movies. The thing I missed was my \\"girlfriend\\" holding on to me.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|I will say up front that I did not like the 2004 remixed & remastered editions of the Megadeth catalog. I strongly feel that classics should not be tinkered with when it comes to remixing, etc. This edition however, is a real treat for the die-hard Megadeth fan. Nothing more can be said about the importance of this album and its contributions to Thrash at the time in 1986. It is a masterpiece right next to Master of Puppets. So here is my take on the 2011 deluxe anniversary edition. The remastering job in my opinion is fantastic. I have studio quality speakers and this remaster truly sounds great. Now, I know some hate the whole \\"loudness\\" wars caused from remastering but in my opinion this remaster does not suffer from that. The album is louder but the music is also extremely crisp and clear. You can hear every note played and I think this is the definitive edition of this album. Disc 2: This is a live cd from 1987. The quality is similar to that of a soundboard bootleg from 1987. The sound is fair on the live cd but remember that most \\"live\\" cds are faked in the studio - this is not! It is simply awesome to hear versions of \\"Looking Down the Cross\\" & \\"Last Rites/Loved To Death\\" on here. This disc is really for the diehards though. I absolutely love it. The band sounds pissed off and full of anger which translates to a great performance. I definitely recommend this release to you Megadeth fans wondering if you should buy this 3rd cd version. Pick it up!
B004ZJZQJC|4.0|The Last Starfighter is a fun movie with decent action and video effects. It's your basic good guy, albeit reluctant, to save the galaxy against the evil, power-hungry villain. The villain is the son of the leader of the Star League...similar to Star Wars. This movie is styled like the video games of the 1980's era...in fact, the plot starts off with Alex (Lance Guest) reaching the final level of the Starfighter video game which is really a test of \\"Starfighter\\" abilities. Alex is then (unknowingly) recruited by Centauri (Robert Preston) to join the Star League and fight as a Starfighter to save the Galaxy, Earth included. Without giving away too much more of the plot, it's a \\"do the right thing\\" story with humor, aliens and, of course, a love story.<br /><br />For the price, it's nice to have the Blu-ray CD version to watch on my big screen TV and have the standard DVD version to watch elsewhere or give away...I haven't decided yet. Plus, you get a (downloadable) digital version to watch on your computer or other digital media player.<br /><br />You'll probably like this movie if you like movies like Star Wars, Men in Black and such.
B004Y1USJE|2.0|The energy is just not there.   It's too bad.   The original Fly From Here performances from 1980 were the best that song was gonna be.   Now, it is neat, tidy, and boring.   It does not sound like Drama II.    Drama was full of energy, and memorable lines, all over the place!    Steve talks about being \\"a rock band again\\", but turns in 2 acoustic songs, plus Bumpy Ride, the stupidest riff ever in a Yes song, which leads allofasudden into a 1 minute reprise of 'Fly', which makes me say, \\"Oh no..\\", and then, it's over.      Side 2 is a waste.  Chris's love song from a solo project from 3 years ago, makes 'Aliens' a glorious memory.  Then another 30-year-old Buggles outtake, & Steve's pieces before the finale, \\"Into The Storm.\\"   This is the only significant new work on FFH;  The only piece with any composition by David, Wakeman, or White!   And it sounds like a Conspiracy-type song, and it certainly doesn't ROCK!  Put on Drama, Big Generator, Fragile, Relayer, even Open Your Eyes!! -- to hear some energy, invention, and excitement.
B0054PSY2W|4.0|its a comedy and thriller and drama romance , and its good, with alot of life in the east some time in the past.
B000002J09|5.0|This is another excellent album...full of good rock and also a couple of more mellow tunes. Whether you're in a hard-core mood or just want to listen to some \\"folk\\" type music, this is the album to get. With the talents of all the band members, you get a full, rich array of music. I just like this album a lot! This being one of my favorite albums of all time but, still, all of Led Zeppelin's artistic work being great.<br /><br />I can't say everyone will love this album but, if you like Led Zeppelin at all, this is one to have in your collection.
B0056E3S4U|5.0|A much better, more complete and thorough CD then his first.    I do worry about it's commercial viability- I don't know that there's a single track as commercially big as 'Light On' was from his opener- but I personally love:  We believe, Take me as I am, This is not the last time, and Hard to Believe.    Buy this CD/Album.      Great artistry like this, by David Cook, should be rewarded.
B00009L1TA|5.0|\\"Basic\\" is one kick-butt military who-dun-it movie.  Travolta is perfect for the role.  Connie Nielsen offers a great balance.  All the other players are generally well-cast.  The story morphs continuously as interrogations proceed throughout the film.  The end?  I can't believe ANYONE complained about the end.  It is a fun exclamation point to a well-schemed plan to reveal the bad guy.  It is impossible to watch \\"Basic\\" one time and catch all that is happening or the significance of the twists and turns.  If you love action flicks, military, and crime mystery rolled into one well-conceived plot you gotta watch \\"Basic.\\"  If I've watched \\"Basic\\" once I've watched it at least a couple dozen times and I STILL see or hear something new that shows the attention to detail in the script.  One fun movie that engages the brain.    BTW, the DVD transfer and Dolby 5.1 soundtrack are exceptional.  Blu-ray (if ever available) would add little to the quality of the images.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Any YES album without Jon Anderson is bound to stir up some mixed feelings but back in 1980 YES proved there could be great YES music without Jon when they released DRAMA.  They prove it again with FLY FROM HERE.  This album may not rank up there with TOPOGRAPHIC and GOING FOR THE ONE but it is a great deal better than OPEN YOUR EYES, MAGNIFICATION or BIG GENERATOR.  After several listens I think I would certainly put it near the top of their catalog.  It actually does sound quite similar to the DRAMA album, undoubtedly because Trever Horn produced it (and did background vocal duties on it) and Geoff Downes is back on keyboards.  Benoit David does an admirable job on the lead vocals and ends up sounding more like Horne than Anderson.  The group vocal harmonies are striking and beautiful but have a bit of an over processed sound.      The new songs are mostly very good, with the FLY FROM HERE Suite being the main attraction and best of the bunch.  As a YES epic I think it stands somewhere in the middle, well below AWAKEN but far better than ENDLESS DREAM.  It does however have a bit of a patched together feel (and yes, I know that all the YES epics are patched together) and in a couple of instances it feels slightly mismatched and strung together in the mixing.  It isn't something entirely top notch like CLOSE TO THE EDGE, THAT THAT IS or MINDRIVE but it works pretty well and it sure sounds good to me.  Next up is MAN YOU ALWAYS WANTED ME TO BE and I think that is a nice enough song but not especially suitable for a YES album.  LIFE ON A FILM SET gets things back on track.  The next two songs are Steve Howe showcases with SOLITAIRE being his best solo work since MASQUERADE. HOUR OF NEED is the albums CIRCUS OF HEAVEN. The recording ends with a bang with INTO THE STORM, very Yessy indeed.  Overall I love this album.  It certainly sounds like YES and I am hugely satisfied with it.      The deluxe version comes with a fold out cover reminiscent of YESSONGS and containsa short, poorly produced, making of DVD.  It's a nice little extra but certaily isn't a great documentary and contains no live performances.  The Roger Dean artwork is beautiful as always and the black cat on the cover was a cute nod to the DRAMA era.    I'm sure this isn't the last studio album we will get from YES and god only knows who will be playing on the next one.  If on the other hand, this should prove to be the swan song, then it is sad Jon isn't here.  On the other hand, this IS a great YES album and a worthy addition to the YES catalog.  Who knows what will happen . . . maybe Billy and Igor will turn up on the next one.  Or perhaps Jon will go on tour with Oliver Wakeman and Trevor Rabin.  I've been following this band for 34 years and nothing these guys do surprises me any more (except their excellent music).
1439181780|1.0|Ok, both the Secret and the Power are books that create excessive thinking in your brain. At first, you will say, \\"wow, why haven't I dont this all along?!\\" because it's wishful thinking, very unrealistic, and poorly executed for every day use. It talks about \\"feeling yourself in the car you want\\", which is to say that some material form will actually produce lasting happiness... all a bunch of crap! Unfortunately, this book will make you much more disappointed as time goes on and will prove to be useless. More excessive THINKING and MATERIAL is NOT what we need in our society today. I'd recommend reading Eckhart Tolle's books, they're life changing, believe me.
078689136X|5.0|I love the TV program Castle so once I started watching the show I discovered the books.  This is the second book I have read and I loved both of them.  It is fun being able to put faces onto the characters of the book.  The TV program and the book follow each other closely which also makes it nice. I am waiting on book 3.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|This will be one of the best metal albums of the year. I love their last album (paradise lost) and this one as well. both are what got me into this band big time. I like the older stuff, but the newer stuff (more straight-up metal mixed in) is fantastic. it is thrashier and kicks so much ass.

0345528581|5.0|This book helped me get my pre-pregnancy body back and then some!     True, it is a bible of bodyweight exercises, but the true value is in the programs Mark put in there.  The 10-week programs magically keep the workout consistent yet varied so you are always on your toes. Each week (or two) has a different set of exercises and a different method to do them. Thanks to these programs, I found out (after years of working out), that varying the method you perform the same exercise (and not just the intensity) really challenges your body and delivers faster results.    Speaking of results. I kept fit through out my pregnancy working out twice a week (doing \\"The Perfect Pregnancy Workout\\") until the 8th month, plus a lot of walking and climbing stairs (no car and fourth floor apartment w/o elevator, that's living in Europe!). Still, 4 months after the little one arrived, I had 10 pounds to lose. And despite exercising during the pregnancy, my muscles all over were weak, my legs and stomach a wobbly mess. The worst part was my back was starting to hunch forward from carrying a baby all day. Constrained by a baby that rarely napped more than 30 minutes, I knew I needed to do intense exercise in a short time. I started again on Pilates but for some reason it wasn't delivering like before. Googling \\"body weight exercises\\" led me to this book, and I started on the basic program immediately.  As others mentioned, don't let the word \\"basic\\" fool you though, it was incredibly challenging.    After only 2 weeks, I started to see significant changes. It felt like my body was shrinking and tightening. After a few more weeks, the comments (and inquiries) from friends started flowing in, \\"Tell me what are you doing?\\", \\"wow, you're back to your old body!\\", etc.  The results were so obvious that a good friend  immediately ordered the book, my boyfriend joined me within two weeks (I regularly find him doing pull ups on our bathroom door), and both my brother and my sister are on the program.    Anyway, 4 or 5 months later now I'm halfway through the \\"First Class Program\\" (that would be the second in the series).  My legs, back and upper body looks so much better (quite shapely and well defined) than even before the pregnancy. My stomach is back (sadly not as slim as before). But my biggest motivation to keep doing this is the strength I gained. All by doing 3 or 4 workouts a week (yes, I must add that I would skip a week here and there, then get back on track which did not seem to affect the results).    Just wanted to give a review from the female point of view. Best money I spent on a book!
B002RKSXJG|5.0|The Woman in White is the story of an escapee from an insane asylum and the mystery of how she is linked to Sir Percival Glyde, as the latter prepares to marry heiress Laura Fairlie.

B004LWZW2E|5.0|Okay, I'm not going to go into what the movie is about, because I think that most of us already know that by now.  What I will tell you is that this movie terrified me in the theatre, and I bought the DVD, already knowing what goes on in the movie, and it terrified me all over again.  The bad thing is that my Mom, who lives in a nursing home, asked me to bring it and watch it with her. She loves horror movies as much as I do, and when she was home, that's how we spent our Friday nights. I took it to watch with her last night, and because she's hard of hearing, we have to close her door so we don't disturb anyone.  Well, all I can say is that during one part of the movie, I yelled so loudly, that one of the nurses came in to see if everything was okay.  So, yeah, this is one very, scary movie, or it was for me, and I'm sure somewhere down the road I'll watch it again and get scared all over again, but you know, whether you go to a theatre or sit in the comfort of your own home, if you are going to watch a scary movie, you want just that, a scary movie, and if it fails to scare you, I don't know about you, but I feel cheated. Rent or buy this movie, you will seriously NOT be disappointed.

1451629184|5.0|Those are only a few words to describe this book, and they don't go about doing it justice.  Jaycee has a great grasp for language and she tells her story with great insight, giving us her own Reflection about what she just wrote.  One of the more painful Reflection coming at one of the more disturbing scenes that I won't go into detail with.<br /><br />I was not going to buy this book.  I am so tired of the victim culture we create.  But, after watching this young woman's interview, I saw that she never sees herself as a victim.  She may have been victimized in the most horrible ways, but today she has her life, she has her daughters, and she has her happiness.  She does not write this book to dwell in the darkness, but to bring the darkness to light, and that, that is not being a victim, that is being a hero of one's own life.<br /><br />Jaycee Dugard tells her story, as she says, because she refuses to cover up and protect a pervert and evil man like Philip Garrido, she says clearly that she doesn't have anything to be ashamed of, because it was not her fault, and she's exactly right.  The things done to her, the things that happened, were not her fault.  And Bless Jaycee for understanding that, and Bless the therapist, or whoever else, who helped her get to that conclusion.  Though, throughout the book there is the line of hope, that will that never broke, a will that will carry her to the future to do wonderful things and help--I'm sure--thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people.<br /><br />Reading this book, in my opinion, it becomes quite clear why she couldn't just leave and why she couldn't escape, even when she was allowed free roam of the yard.  A Prison doesn't need locks, someone only must believe that the cell is locked for them to not try to pull the bars open.  She was conditioned to believe that escape was impossible, so, she accepted that escape was impossible.  As anyone can see, she never really sided with her captors, she simply wanted to live, and she simply adapted to what life she had to live.  And, through clear deprivation, the fear of loss far outweighed the possibility of gain, such as when she had the internet... it's marketing 101, and it's a cogent psychological factor.<br /><br />For a young woman with a fifth grade education, she writes beautifully, and I hope she doesn't stop, there is beauty in her soul, you can see it with her passion for animals, her passion for her children, her passion for her own life.  Now that the horror has been disposed of, the beauty could add to our cannon of literature.<br /><br />I wish Jaycee the best of luck, and I hope everyone can find this book as life affirming in the end, as I did.e, and she simply adapted to what life she had to live.

B0057AOOZ0|2.0|Well I had to give this 2 stars because I can't exactly say I \\"HATE\\" it! However, Beyonce and I are the same age and yet I feel she lost touch with my age group a looong time ago. Unfortunately this CD felt immature, repetitive, watered-down and just too fluffy. I actually chose this CD over Jill Scott's new Light of the Sun because I wanted to hear what Beyonce had to say *first*. I totally dismissed the thought of even buying Sasha Fierce after hearing it at a listening party so I was truly curious this time around. Well hence my subject title, this one went right back to the little music store I shop from in exchange for Jill Scott's CD. Maybe if I was 12 I would think Bee was deep on this one, but I'm not and so I just dont understand how a previous reviewer wrote this was a \\"Grown & Sexy\\" project. What? Yeah this is NOT the CD I would put on to chill out & have drinks w/ my girls. Another disappointment. I would say if there's another project in the future, perhaps aim for more sophisticated song-writing. We've seen (and heard) enough booty-popping Bee...it's time to show us the heart & soul of the Woman and Artist that u are.     I can't say don't buy it...but I highly recommend you try it out at a retailer with a return/exchange policy.
014305841X|4.0|This book set out to show several problems with the agricultural system in the US and to present some currently implemented solutions.  The book is quite interesting, it presents a lot of interesting information.  The viewpoint of the author is not convincingly unbiased though (at least not to me), which could force you to view the whole book through a lens of skepticism.  Suffice it to say, if you aren't strongly for sustainable agriculture this book might not be for you.    That being said, this book covers a lot of ground concerning sustainable, healthy agriculture and it is quite informative and hopeful.  I'd recommend the book to anyone interested in those attributes.
B0057AOOZ0|5.0|Beyonce is undoubtedly a talented artist, but what makes me love her is that she is confident enough in her talent to try different things with her voice, and different sounds.  I think this is an album that everyone can appreciate:  old, young, and across different genres.  Included:  Good songs that you'll want to sing and dance along to, positive energy, and that Beyonce stamp that makes it all hers...  Love it :)
0316098329|1.0|If there was a choice of no stars......       Maybe it's the timing of my reading this book but it seems like a riff on the story of Jaycee.  Stolen mother, child born in captivity, shed in the backyard, older man then eventual freedom.    I am not quite halfway and honestly don't think I can finish.  It's hard to stomach the point of view of the child (who is inconsistent to say the least), I feel as though the first 124 pages that I have read are repetitive to the extreme and I can't get past the constant reference back to breastfeeding.  I am all for breastfeeding but I fail to see what it adds to the story.  Those things coupled with the feeling of deja Jaycee put this one on the \\"sorry I bought it\\" list.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Both of these movies are very real and tell the story of both wars in very real detale. I think any one that likes stories about WW2 will love both of these movies. Both a must see for history buffs.
0316056863|5.0|My favorite book of the summer.  I love the timeline given, her background and how I could \\"hear\\" her talking as I read.    Super!  Just as funny and sassy as the writer!
B004YTGRMI|5.0|I must say that this record didn't become one of my favorites from the IRS era in the R.E.M. catalogue until a year later, when I originally bought it (that title belonged to the magnifiscent MURMUR and RECKONING). Nevertheless, years later I began to appreciate it as well as the darker FABLES OF THE RECONSTRUCUTION. Personally, I got pretty excited about this released since in this album there are a couple of tracks I am deeply in love with: the one and only \\"Fall on me\\" and the fresh and amazing \\"I believe\\". It's not that I don't care for the other songs because I really do but, these ones in particular showed the essence of a band like R.E.M. when I bought my first tape of singles from the IRS era called \\"Best of...\\" back in my high school years.<br /><br />Talking about this released, the remasterization is AMAZING and CRISPY (as someone else established it here). You can identify each and every instrument in the songs. The powerful guitar sounds from Peter Buck in \\"Begin the begin\\" and \\"These days\\", the mellow arpeggios that drives \\"Fall on me\\" to an excellence level (provided by Mr. Buck as wel)or the bass lines and notes on the awesome \\"Cuyahoga\\" and \\"I believe\\" played by Mike Mills. Even \\"Swan swan H\\" here sounds stronger and happier with the remasterization. Now, as far as Michael Stipe's lyrics and vocals is concerned, they were top notch here at the time this record was released. I find \\"Fall on me\\" lyrics and Stipe performance as well so real and pure. \\"I believe\\" has these lines that have always been around my head for years, \\"My throat hurts... my shirt is wearing thin... that's what I believe in\\" here Stipe is sending a message that BELIEVING in something or someone (if you have a politician in mind) is not a matter of accepting things just because someone else is telling us to do so but, something we KNOW from real facts. Amazing lines written by Stipe at the time.<br /><br />On the other hand, as a \\"hardcore R.E.M. fan\\" that I am, I instantly felt in love with the \\"Athens demos\\" CD. Now, something that I didn't like is that some songs are only sung by Stipe half way (e.g. Cuyahoga) but of course, since this is a demo version I'm not expecting to have the complete performance here. Something to point out and that made me very happy was the demo of \\"Bad day\\" because back in 1999-2000, I found it somewhere on the internet and I taped it in a cassette but now, I finally have it on an original CD.<br /><br />As far as the postcards and the poster is concerned, obviously I love having these kind of accesories (I already hung the poster on my bedroom wall, right above my bed:)). For big R.E.M. fans, this re-issue is a MUST, but if people are not that attached to the R.E.M. catalogue, THIS re-issue is a good place to start.\\"Athens demos\\" CD.

0545265355|5.0|I bought the new product of the hard cover \\"The Hunger Games,\\" trilogy and it showed up in a box with correct packaging and better (not to mention 1/2 the price) than (of) the big name book stores. It says new and it means new. The best book series ever by the way (at least on my personal list.)
B003UESJIS|1.0|Downer on steroids.  There is the aging single woman:  desperate, pathetic, she drinks too much and scrounges for a man to take her in.  She hits on her friends' son.   There is the overweight guy who also drinks too much.  One happy(?) couple who wonder about their friends who are falling apart.  Family members die.  What is the point?  Is it about being married, single, drinking too much, aging, loneliness, desperation, or just that life generally sucks and then you die?
B003QCCS3Q|5.0|The album came to my home packaged very secure and very quickly. The package was in 100% perfect condition when it arrived. I would purchase from seller again if they had the item I wanted at a good price this.  Ron
B000085RTX|5.0|I have no problem calling this their best work since I have heard this, Epica (also a Great one!), most of The Black Halo, most of Ghost Opera, and most of Poetry for the Poisoned. Full of awesome riffs, overall epic songs, amazing singing, and (EXTREMELY) fast drumming. Roy Khan is a very good vocalist and is one of the best in power metal (with the best going to: a tie between Symphony X's Russell Allen and Stratovarius' Timo Kotipelto.) Casey Grillo should be commended for his drumming! He can drum FAST!<br /><br />Now on to the music:<br /><br />1. \\"Regalis Apertura\\"- A beautiful intro instrumental to a great album. I love this. It is very pretty and then the last note holds into the next track when Youngblood comes in with the incredible guitar melody for the next song.<br /><br />2. \\"Forever\\"- Amazing. Just simply awesome. This band can play but the way it's mixed isn't what most people are used to hearing; the instruments are mixed behind the vocals so much that it really brings the voice out. It's not bad, it's just different. Nice mixing job!<br /><br />3. \\"Wings of Despair\\"- A very cool, intense song with a killer guitar intro. This song is in a triplet style and it rocks! One of my faves on the album!<br /><br />4. \\"The Spell\\"- This is a slower rock song and it does what most slower rock songs do; Hypnotize you with the beat into headbanging along. Very Strong song and has an interesting atmosphere to it.<br /><br />5. \\"Don't You Cry\\"- Very pretty acoustic ballad. It only has an acoustic guitar, violin, and Khan's operatic vocals. Very moving and pretty song dedicated and written for guitarist Thomas Youngblood's passed father. One of the highest points of the album!<br /><br />6. \\"Karma\\"- Another track in the style of \\"Forever\\", it has a very nice intro and I like the chorus as well as the music to it. A Kamelot Klassic!<br /><br />7. \\"The Light I Shine on You\\"- I like this one's melody. I has a great beat and another great melody (what else do you expect from these guys?! They always have great melodies!)<br /><br />8. \\"Temples of Gold\\"- A pretty song. This is a ballad but has the full band this time around. Great song!<br /><br />9. \\"Across the Highlands\\"- Another catchy song in the style of \\"Forever\\" & \\"Karma\\". This one rocks just as hard!<br /><br />Tracks 10-12: \\"Elizabeth: parts I, II, & III\\"- These are Ok songs but I say they are the worst three songs on the album. I really don't listen to these...I've heard them a few times but they just don't catch my attention.<br /><br />Bonus Track:<br />I don't know how to spell this but the bonus track I have is just \\"Don't You Cry\\" in French. I don't listen to it because it's the exact same song just with Khan singing in French!<br /><br />Verdict: This is a great album and if you're new to Kamelot, this is a good place to start (This was my 1st Kamelot album) or You could also start with Epica which is also a great album. If you're a fan and don't have it, then GET IT! This is their peak IMO. And if you like The Fourth Legacy, then You'll love this. They perfected their sound in this one from The Fourth Legacy.
B000003TAB|4.0|...along with a rocking version of \\"Polly\\". Not too much to say, but if you like Nirvana this is a gotta-have.
B0035KGX9E|5.0|Non of their albums can compare to the awesomeness of Twilight in Olympus (Which is my fave and naturally, their best IMO). But this album is great in it's own right. It's the bridge between 2 chapters and of course because of this, features of both chapters are present. The Odyssey is the last album with the symphonic elements found in \\"Twilight.\\" and \\"V\\". But the birth of their heavy era which continued into Paradise Lost and the recent Iconoclast. I know some symphonic elements are present in Paradise Lost and more so in Iconoclast but they are MORE than a lot heavier albums than their really symphonic albums    Now on to the actual Music:    The music is much like this cover art; it's mysterious, epic, heavy, and always moving...It's one of their most amazing albums and much different from the previous album, \\"V: The New Mythology Suite\\".    1. \\"Inferno (Unleash the Fire)\\"- The main riff at the beginning is very frantic but sounds really cool. Romeo shows us he's an extremely skilled guitarist with this song. And Russell uses his heavy metal growl voice in the verses but his clear voice shines in the pre-chorus and choruses. Great song and the rest of the album follows this manner.    2. \\"Wicked\\"- The title describes the song; this song is wicked. The opening is heavy and it's one of their slower but heavy songs. Russell sings with his clear voice tone in this one and sounds like something that could have potentially been on V. Another good song.    3. \\"Incarnations of the Apprentice\\"- I'm not a very big fan of this one but it's Symphony X so it's already better than most of the music out there these days. It starts off with a dark sounding French horn melody and the guitar takes that and it turns into another song like \\"Wicked\\" but with better drums IMO. But I don't like it because the chorus isn't their strongest (not that it's weak! It's stronger than many others but not the ones on this album).    4. \\"Accolade II\\"- Great song! Another high point of the album. It starts off with a violin and Mike P. playing a piano accompaniment with it. Then it becomes a classic like the original \\"Accolade\\" (from The Divine Wings of Tragedy) did. Great song and it has that symphonic element to it that give these guys their name.    5. \\"King of Terrors\\"- This starts off with a drum hit and eerie playing until the guitar comes in. This is another song in which Russell sings the verses with his metal growl but shines in the chorus with his high clear voice. I love the chorus of this one! It's really catchy. Yet another high point    6. \\"The Turning\\"- Not my favorite. Another song that I'm not that fond of but again, it is Symphony X so it's better than most music out there today. It actually is starting to grow on me though, so it may become a favorite. It is reminiscent of the style of \\"V\\" so it's not that bad. I like it better than \\"Incarnations of the Apprentice\\" though.    7. \\"Awakenings\\"- This song starts off slowly and goes into something like \\"Accolade II\\" mixed with something a little faster and heavier. It's a good song but it's eclipsed by the title track coming up next.    8. \\"The Odyssey\\"- Wow!!! Their best epic for sure! I think that this is their best song that's over 12 minutes. Not overall, just over that length. The whole song is an amazing voyage but the best part is the end in my opinion. The ending melody is amazing and then the words \\"Triumphant...Champion of Ithaca...\\" Great ending to a Great album    Verdict: Great album but for starting off with this album, I have mixed feelings...I tried to start with this one and I just didn't feel it...I just didn't like it. Then the name Twilight in Olympus came up and I tried that album, then I got into them. I guess if you start with this one, you need to be into heavier music rather than Images and Words era Dream Theater.    If you are a Symphony X fan and don't have this, then you should! Excellent album and I think it's one of their classic albums.
B004EPYZPI|3.0|A pretty decent legal/courtroom drama, and certainly not the worst MM movie either. He plays a slick defense attorney who up until now has defended scumbags as long as he got a nice paycheck. Without giving anything away, he gets introduced to a potential new client, who is extremely wealthy and is falsely accused of assault. He starts to see dollar signs and from there the game is afoot. Great supporting cast in William H Macy, Marisa Tomei and others. A few cliche moments, and sometimes MM comes off a little too full of himself.Is definably is NOT theater release movie to see, that's why got flop in box office...is very slow type of LIFETIME channel court room drama made for TV movie. Nothing special to WOW u to see in theaters & I am glad I didn't!! >But a rental worth!
B0044KU7EQ|5.0|I had this on wish list for a long time , so very glad that I finally bought it . The collection is an historical archive of this genre . I can highly recommend this collection to any blues lover .
1451629184|5.0|Received this memoir on Tuesday and finished it in 1 day.  Part tragedy, part triumph, 100% excellent read.  Jaycee lays open her life in the pages within.  You will smile, you will cry and you will be amazed at the unstoppable spirit of Jaycee Lee Dugard.  I cannot believe what it must have taken for this young woman to turn her tragic, heartbreaking ordeal into an triumph of the spirit and heart. Incredibly well written for someone with only a fifth grade education, Jaycee will inspire you.  What she suffered at the hands of Phillip and Nancy Garrido is revealed in graphic and straightforward detail, as well as her secrets of survival, her strength to deliver two babies in a backyard without medical care, and the hours and hours of isolation and mind control at the hands of a psychopathic madman.   I would highly recommend this book, and let it be said that this young woman wrote from her soul, this is not entertainment to sell books.  If you are looking for that, do not buy this book. If however, you want to be inspired, and can empathize with what Jaycee endured then this book is 100% for you. God Bless you Jaycee. How I admire your courage and beautiful spirit. You are an ispiration for this generation!
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I found the film '127 Hours' to be extremely difficult to watch, particularily so since it's a true life account. I began fidgeting early on in my viewing and as the storyline inched closer and closer to the inevitable event I began losing eye contact with the screen, staring down at my dog or getting up and going to the kitchen for another cup of coffee. As I said, this was an extremely difficult watch.<br /><br />Having openly revealed my lack of fortitude to millions you would probably expect me not to recommend this film. Well, that would definitely be true in the case of small children, the film is far too intense and disturbing. Furthermore if this movie was only about the extreme events that occurred in the life of outdoor enthuasist Aron Ralston (played brilliantly by James Franco) for no other reason than pure shock value and financial gain I also would not recommend the film.<br /><br />However there is another dimension to this tale of unbelievable horror that needed to be told. Exactly what is this other dimension of which I speak? Well you could call it mankinds inate biologically induced will to survive, or man's ability to tap into a higher source or divine power in times of desperation, or quite possibly a hands on discourse on the timeless processes of karma and destiny.<br /><br />I made it through to the end by tuning into the internal dialogue going on in Aron Ralston's mind during his unbelievable ordeal. His thoughts, feelings, memories and future aspirations are laid out before the audience. Past, present and future converge and focus on one spot and moment in time and space. That point of convergence being the place where Aron's hand, rock and cliff meet and all that was, is and may yet be hang in the balance. An entire universe of possiblities will be determined by what is about to take place. As Aron so succintly put it, \\"this rock has been waiting for me my entire life\\". Yes it has and what he does next will determine everything!<br /><br />Amazing film if you're up for it.it.
1400064627|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Ms Flagg's novel - Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistle Stop Cafe: A Novel.  It was entertaining as a summer read.  However, it is a 'period piece' and not reflective of the modern South today.  Readers, particularly, the young ones should bear this in mind.
038534273X|1.0|I was really hoping this would be an entertaining account but it reads like the company's PR team wrote it. The book is long on wet kisses for Google's founders and short on details, anecdotes, etc. At some point it just implodes, making this a waste of reading time.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|This is a partially redesigned version of set 10213 which Lego released in 2010. The set proved very popular, so after considering the feedback Lego received, they decided to redesign parts of it in order to make it a bit more durable for play. So 10231, released in the summer of 2011, is largely a strengthened 10213. The main changes are to the main fuel tank, landing gear, Canadarm, and cargo doors. Most of the changes are small, but the change to the main fuel tank is large, adding a long gray assembly between the SRBs and the main fuel tank. This makes the vehicle stronger but visually less realistic (if that is important to you).     If your child is a space enthusiast, this set really is a must. It is also a good deal considering the quantity and variety of parts included. Between this set and the other big space set this year, #3368 Space Center, both are very good, but the shuttle set is more intricate, a bit harder to build, and more historically significant. Both sets have very good playability. I would lean towards #3368 for younger builders, and #10231 for older builders.    As for the nuts and bolts, the landing gear retracts, the cargo doors open, you can access the cockpit and fit the two astronauts inside, you can separate the different parts of the rocket assembly (SRBs, main fuel tank), you can \\"launch\\" the satellite with the arm, and you have a modest launch pad for holding the entire package.     To get a really good sense of the product, look on Youtube for Lego's designer interview for set 10213 (keeping in mind there have been small changes to 10231). The set sells itself.
B0000683DH|5.0|Even with the series reboot, this is still probably the best Star Trek movie made.  Rather than ignore the advance of time and age of the characters, the story embraces and addresses it- a feature not found again until The Undiscovered Country.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Instead of investing $$ into a wired system that could hook up my mp3 player i decided to try out the radio transmitter version. Plugged it in, plug in my flash drive, synchronized the frequency and presto! It works! And I will admit not bad! I mean this is not CD quality but darn close, close enough to keep this little gadget. Music with not static ! Now I can go back to listening audiobooks without 25 CD's
B000KIE11Q|3.0|I've owned several Swatches since the Jellyfish in the mid 80's. This has been my favorite and most expensive. I'll just get to the negative points on this watch: 1) the rubber/plastic links easily break (within 6 months for me) which cost me over $40 to get a new band, and 2) the hands to the minute and hour chrono are not lined up true.    My next Swatch-family purchase will be a Tissot.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I don't know why people are saying wait! Or rather, \\"The 3D versions are coming out in 2012!\\" Ok, to start off THIS IS AMAZING! Also, they didn't have the technology to shoot these movies in 3D so, sorry to say it, but the 3D probably isn't going to be that good! I also saw someone complain about paying $90 for it! Are you serious! Have you looked at what's included! Even if the package just had the films that's pretty good....IT'S SIX FILMS! And 3 BLU-RAY (not DVD) discs of behind the scenes stuff and documentaries! That's a lot of stuff!    I for one am going to get this the day that it is released! I am not going to wait for him to release another version! Look how long it took for Lucas to originally put them on dvd, and again how long it took for them to come out on blu-ray!    BOTTOM LINE: AMAZING SET AT AN AMAZING PRICE!
0061729078|2.0|Ok I bought the book to see what induced Ray Manzarek and Jim Morrison to name their band \\"The Doors\\". After reading the hyper-intellectualized accounts of getting loaded and then viewing the world while under the influence, the book found a semi permanent lodging place under the edge of my bed. The music of the Doors still moves me and gets played every day I am in my shop. The book is an excellent read before bed because it quickly puts me to sleep. Reading this book 50 years after the fact is not like reading Michner or Camus or Sartre. Its is a stuffy read, dated, and as I discovered.... not like having a crystal ball to peer into the 60's minds of the Doors.
1451629184|3.0|Picked up at K-Mart on the first day available, finished next morning.  Easy read.       Ms. Dugard gives us background of her life, explains she lives with mom and step-dad, he is less than involved.  She heads out to school, a car stops her, a guy holds his hand out. She thinks he is going to ask directions and he drops her with a stun-gun! Who would do that to a youngster! PATHETIC!      Takes her to their place, blanket over head, and into the house. Then to a 'studio' out back. LOCKED in. told there are dogs outside. She resorts to sleep.  Unable to keep track of time due to... no clock and towel over window. Threatens her with gun if she doesn't do what he says. UGG! He does have a cat and from here on in she focuses on animals, perhaps as a method to deal with what has now become her living hell prison. Oh, and a shower with her new...companion. He does take her in his arms for comfort, the beginning of mind control, he is the only one who can help her. Sick. Then he hand cuffs her.      The next day he feeds her, oh, and has sex with her. She tries to be nice to him. Sounds prett strong emotionally for an 11-year-old. He eventually installs an air-conditioner for her. She sits in the room all day each day. Mind numbing.   He plays songs on his guitar and sings to her, songs he wrote. He thinks he will be famous. If he can trust her he will take off the cuffs.       He gives her a cat, she names it Tigger, she gets a pot to go to the bathroom in. She feels if she thinks really hard about something, it won't happen.  So, she has to think about every possible thing. (Yikes!) then he takes the cat because it pees everywhere and he doesn't like the smell when he comes there! (She is living in it!)       She inserts thoughts from the current time frequently to reflect upon what we have just read. Insightful, she does ramble a bit.       Then he introduces her to a 'run' where he takes drugs  and then can stay up and have sex for an extended time. The unknown isthe scariest thing.       He tells her he going to sell her to people that will put her in a cage! Because she cries and is not coopertive, so she says she will try harder. After their sessions he would appoligize. Oh, and he would video tape as well.       She meets his wife Nancy. One time he tells Jaycee he has a suprise for her, it turns out that the suprise is that Nancy got a hair cut! (Twisted!) She does get a color TV and Nintendo. she tries to be nice to Nancy, she wants Nancy to like her, Nancy is jealous of her. Threatens her that she may have to have sex with the dog.-- She make barbie furniture from small milk cartons.       Phillip is gone for a month, Nancy says he is on an island with a friend, he is in jail. Upon his return she is happy to see him!  He makes her laugh by talking in different accents. She is a regular watcher of the Today show.       She eventually gets her own tent! They got her another cat she names Eclipse, they say  they paid $200, she is so greatful,the cat is worth every penny and she could never repay them-- she writes in a journal for Eclipse that we get to read her entries.  She has good hand writing. They eventually took the cat.       Aftert three years she is prego, they watch birth videos and she gives birth, in the backyard, Nancy is a nurse's assistant. At one point she is shuttled to a mobile home.  She has not had a flush toilet in three years. She watches TV to prepare to be a mom.       Later she has a second baby, nancy gets jealous so, Jaycee has to go by the name of Allissa and the girls will call Nancy--Mom.        Just an endless string of crazy behavior.  She even speaks to a parole office who visits.  They are eventually found out and freed.  The final third of the book is her and her children reaclamating to society. A riveting read. Unlike anything else I have ever read. she is amazing.  I have known pople who have gone through what would seem like less and are more angry than she appears to be.
B004WKOCP8|4.0|This album is good. I don't like it, it wasn't what I was expecting to get from the band, but it's still good. You can tell they still put dedication into every song. They are also at that point where they shouldn't have to worry about what other people think. Make the music they want to make. I now have 7 Incubus albums, and they have more! This one is definitely the \\"mellow\\" one. Nice to see that they are not stuck on only being loud, fast, full of energy. Slightly disappointed that they put Adolescents out as the first single because that was the closest thing to the Incubus I'm use to. Kinda lures us fans in to buying it right away. I don't think it's great, but I don't think any other song on the album gets heavier. I don't regret buying it, but I have listened to the other albums twice as much since I bought this one. Definitely won't be getting as much listening time as the last 6 albums.<br />If you compare it to the other albums, I'd give it 1 or 2 stars, but if you can imagine the album as it's own without Incubus' past history of greatness, I'd go 3-4 stars. It's just... quiet.
1603580557|5.0|I am not an engineer and had never given systems theory much thought until I stumbled across this book.<br /><br />The most important takeaway for me was the difference between parameter and system changes. A parameter change would be a variable like minimum wage or taxes. Politicians spend tons of time and money on these issues. But in the end, this rarely changes behavior and the national economy; rich people still find a way to pay less taxes.<br /><br />To change a system, you have to make drastic moves (i.e: Fair Tax) that radically alter the functions of the system to alter behavior.<br /><br />Also of note was the importance roles versus people: People are more alike than we think, it is more their role/job functions that determines their behavior.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book - it will improve the objectivity of your analysis and decisions, well worth the few dollars you paid.
B004WKOCP8|2.0|First cd since 2006 and we get this crap, I think Incubus is done making good music. The only good songs are promises, adolecents, and the bonus songs. Wait until the 19th and get the 311 cd, way better band that still has it.
B004Y1USV2|2.0|I really wanted to like the first release in 10 years from one of my favorite bands...Everything seemed to be there...except for good lyrics and any sense of melody...I listened to the CD three times yesterday and I STILL do not remember a single chorus or verse...So sad.  The new singer does a decent job but I miss Jon Anderson...Many people have compared this recording to Drama...Not as good...not even close.
0553801473|1.0|First of all a disclaimer: I loved all the four previous instalments of Song of Ice and Fire, included A Feast for Crows. But with this new novel... I was bored, bored to death. Sometimes I surprised myself skimming over the text, without even actually caring to read. Worst of all is that half in the novel, I felt that I wasn't caring for what happened with the characters. Even Tyrion and Daenerys, my two favourite characters in the previous novels, looked cartoonish, stereotyped, soulless. The events on the Wall were as dull as reading a taxes manual. And to make it even worst, after 1,000 odd pages of boredom, the end of the novel made me feel cheated.<br /><br />Sincerely, I doubt I will bother to read the next novel, much less buy it.
B004SBB0LU|3.0|Buy the original releases on vinyl - I just bought the first Queen LP for $14, a first pressing UK released EMI labelled LP. Go that route and make your own CDs and you have the best sound/format combination you can get. But that's just my opinion.
B0054JURZA|4.0|The good: A number of outstanding songs (Perth, Holocene, Lisbon, OH + Beth/Rest), a fantastic collection of sounds and complex instrumentation. Lyrically perfect.    The bad: This album had the potential to become the top album of the year but the production values are just so low that it makes it hard to listen to. Half of the tracks sound hollow despite a multitude of instrumentation. If you want specific examples:    Perth: 2:32    Michicant: 3:00-End    Hinnom, TX: 1:59-End    Calgary: 1:45 it gets really bad, again at 2:28, but the whole track is a mess    Even Beth / Rest, despite the use of synth (if you're going to use it, you might as well highlight its strengths), lacks dynamic range and depth. I yell OPEN UP! at this song because it has the potential to absolutely knock your socks off: instead it just taps you. Disappointing.    If this album were remastered by a good producer, it could be 100x better. I know you like doing it yourself Justin, but it hurts the musicianship! You can hold your own during the vocals but if you want long, drawn out instrumentation you need to layer it correctly. As it stands, I could cut the last 30 seconds from each track across the board and have a stronger album.
0307272702|5.0|I have to say thank you to Gary Taubes for writing this book. I bought 'Good Calories Bad Calories' about a year ago and it totally changed my life, but I could never quite get past about page 300! Although amazingly researched and very clearly written, that book is a bit of a slog. This book, on the other hand, is succinct and simple. The message is powerful and easily understandable by the most impatient of lay-people (me).   That message is simply that eating low-carb will not only make you lose weight, but it is actually GOOD FOR YOU too. This was what rocked my world. I mean, I have known since 2002 that I could drop weight quickly and easily by eating only meat, cheese, and greens and cutting out all bread, pasta, and sugar. BUT, I thought I was doing something unhealthy! I thought I was sacrificing my body's wellbeing for vanity. So I always felt pretty ashamed of eating low-carb, of 'admitting' that I was eating low carb to others. I would always hide it or fob it off by saying only, \\"oh I cut down on sugar...\\" when people asked me how I lost 20 lbs in 4 months and then kept it off. And I would sit in silence when people would comment that Atkins was unhealthy and that people who did it were fooling themselves.   But not anymore! What Gary Taubes has given me - and what I want to thank him for - is the certainty that the way I am eating is good for me and for my family. I can eat the way that makes me feel good (no more headaches, 2pm sleepies, or that \\"starving\\" feeling) knowing that I'm taking care of myself. And now that I have a young daughter I can start her on a lifetime of good eating habits too. And when people start to talk ignorantly about this way of eating, I can refer them to this book (and/or keep a few copies on my person to hand out) and the arguments within.   So thank you, Gary Taubes! And to everyone else - buy this book today. If you evaluate the evidence with an open mind it will surely change your life the way it changed mine.
B000IAZOYO|2.0|I heard and read all the hype on this book.  It seemed every one I knew was reading it and just going on and on about \\"what a love story\\"!!!  I got to see the movie...it was not bad...but then I only watched it because I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood, \\"then\\" I read the book!!!  Now I wish I had not!  It could have been a better story but this one was just dull and on the boring side.  I was disappointed in it all the way!
B00376AWHK|4.0|One of the all time greatest albums in rock history is now on 24k audio fidelity gold disc. The sound quality is great - as always with audio fidelity.  But I am a guitarist and always listen closely to the guitar.  In the case of this classic Deep Purple gem with the legendary Ritchie Blackmore on guitar, that is the focus for me.  I have to say, to me, it sounds like the guitar is mixed down a little.  Maybe to reduce noise, but it seems to me that it is slightly subdued compared to other versions.  I have the 25th anniversary 2 cd set and the guitar sounds better to me on that recording.  Now, as always, the sound system you listen on has something to do with the over all sound and eq.  I am listening on a bose system and they have more of a pre-set eq system.  So this may be the ultimate recording for you.  I collect mobile fidelty discs and always enjoy the consistent quality the company offers.

B0015AARJI|1.0|We all know that the Dualshock 3 is the best controller on the market.  Be careful who you buy it from though.  I purchased this from one of the other sellers.  The packaging looked legit and had the model# CECHZC2U on the package, but when I opened it the controller had a model# CECHZC2H on the sticker.  I knew this was not a legit controller because the small reset button on the back of the controller was missing.  It was just an empty hole on the back of the controller.  I returned and was promptly refunded by Amazon.  Pay the few extra dollars and get the real thing from Amazon and skip the other sellers for this item.
0452289963|5.0|This book has changed my life. I did have a rough start after struggling to digest the first chapter and took couple of month's procrastination. But starting seconds chapter I could not stop until I finished the book. I have read this book several times, heard the audio version, read \\"Power Of Now\\". I have given it as a present to many friends. Eckhart Tolle comes across as a person with a lot of credibility simply because I could hear in this voice what he is preaching.    This book is not against any religion but rather cites almost all religions and teaches a very basic aspect of life which most of us forget either due to the \\"rat race\\" or various obstacles along the way.    IT IS A MANUAL TO LIFE AND MUST READ FOR ANYONE STRIVING TO MAKE THEIR LIFE BETTER.
031261246X|5.0|I was already a big fan of Mark Russinovich thanks to his Winternals work and also him being a Technical Fellow at Microsoft.    What I didn't expect from Mark was such an explosive, plausible and scary thriller that I couldn't put the book down until I'd finished reading.    The great thing is, although the novel has a really modern feel, it is so well written that it doesn't require any special technical knowledge to enjoy; Mark has used his vast technical experience to weave an utterly believable and realistic story that features legitimate (and scary!) scenarios that the World faces today, such as CyberTerrorism.    The characters are well defined and interesting, and there is never a dull moment - it has action and heart wrapped up in a terrifying scenario.    This is an important and contemporary book that I have to recommend as a 'must read'.
0887307280|4.0|I really enjoyed this book because of the way it's organized and presented. Michael Gerber has done an excellent job in citing the myth and then in explaining the reality. I especially liked how each chapter has a theory and then it that applies to a character's (named Sarah) situation. Must read for aspiring or current entrepreneurs.
B004A8ZX2S|4.0|I start this not knowing what I feel about Tree of Life. Such is the nature of the written word; something becomes of what is not there.<br /><br />My first thoughts are given to the narrative style of the filmmaker. Or how the story is put together. Fascinating. And cinematic. Memories of 2001: A Space Odyssey. This is a truly cinematic film even with Malik's trademark hand-held camera technique which I found rewarding as it does fit the environment for the story. I went into FACT cinema Liverpool not knowing what the story would be but having recently viewed Thin Red Line on dvd was sufficiently impressed to wish to see his latest film.<br /><br />Left the film feeling that bringing up kids means that two plus two does not always make four. It may be the basis for our education system but logic and parenting are not natural bedfellows. I also was reminded that before I was born women were treated as second class humans.<br /><br />You do not have to like your kids in order to bring them up well. In the film parents trying to force the issue of loving are seen right through. In the audience at my afternoon viewing one elderly couple nearby were bemused by it all, I shan't say the basic questions they had, it would give the story away. I can understand their bewilderment. Where I was totally immersed in the filmmaker's visual flair and appreciated his grasp of infinity, others may dive in the popcorn.<br /><br />Whilst I have mentioned how cinematic the film is I should also point out that the dvd will bring the best out of the gorgeous soundtrack. The sound of aloneness is the best I can do in respect of its description. Brahms and pipe organs are part of the story. Part of a character. Don't be put-off by the provisional artwork on the dvd cover: this is not a gooey movie.<br /><br />Finally one can not comment on Tree of Life without mentioning a spiritual element. In my case I saw enough to just about believe that Malick left something for us who lean toward the idea of a complex, inventive reality which is persistently happening throughout the universe and the one next door.<br /><br />I knew I'd get somewhere. Hope you do too.ich is persistently happening throughout the universe and the one next door.    I knew I'd get somewhere. Hope you do too.
1400064287|5.0|This is one of best books I have read in the recent past. It has a very cohesive message about how to make an idea stick. The Heath brothers have done a phenomenal job of applying the techniques presented in the book to write the book itself. I loved the way they have an acronym \\"SUCCES\\" which has stuck in mind ever since and they go on expanding on letter on each chapter. It's a must read for anyone interested in trying to influence another person with their ideas.
0321356683|5.0|This book describes the \\"correct\\" way to use the Java programming language and its main features (no standard API or Java EE).    Through a series of \\"items\\" Joshua Bloch explains in great detail how to write robust, maintainable and effective Java code. Each item is self-contained (or explicitly point to other items), so that the book can serve as a great reference for the professional programmer.    Some items will seems obvious to experienced programmers, but they will surely benefit from the thoroughness of the discussion and will anyway learn something in other items.    This book is not for complete beginners: one should have a solid foundation in Java or at least in another object-oriented language.
0061914177|5.0|Gary Vee has done a fantastic book to encapsulate the social media storm and how anyone can leverage his to advantage. The best thing about the author is he is not just presenting a hypothesis but he himself is a living example of it. I could feel his passion and energy in the book. The book also has fantastic tactical action items to get started. For example - anyone with a full time job can still do it from 7 pm to 2 am or something like that. Anyone with kids can do it from 9 pm to 3 am etc.

140053271X|5.0|I'm a bit of an android fan, so when the nook product line was first announced, I was onboard (I skipped the kindle because I didn't want a big keyboard cluttering up the space). I got it at launch, and used it frequently. Then... the iPad came out, and I found that when the B&N eReader app came out, I was bringing my nook with me less, because, hey, I could just use the iPad to read, right? Why bring a device almost as big just to read books, when the eReader app (despite the drawbacks of a color screen vs. e-ink, etc.) worked just as well? So I sold the nook.<br /><br />Then a funny thing happened. I stopped reading as much. See, with the iPad I was watching videos, playing games, messing around with apps, etc. Which is great, but I just ended up opening things other than the eReader app. At the time this dawned on me, I immediately thought \\"If only there was a smaller form factor for the nook, I'd probably take that with me more, and start reading again...\\"<br /><br />Enter the nook touch. It's much smaller, much lighter, and ditches the color touchscreen (which was frankly always a bit of a pain) at the bottom of the device. What you're left with is a lean, mean, reading machine. It's not without its flaws. I'm not going to touch on the platform itself (the original nook and nookColor reviews cover that pretty extensively), but I did want to talk about some of the differences from the eyes of an original nook owner.<br /><br />Even for a techie like me, I struggled with the interface at first, so here's a few items of note:<br /><br />The Good/Notable:<br /><br />- You can both tap the screen on the left or right side (left meaning page back, right meaning page forward) OR swipe left/right to turn pages.<br />- Additionally there's buttons under the rubber on the left and right side of the front of the device. This has been an absolute boon for one-handed reading, which happens constantly for me with a device so light. Switching hands still gives me the power to paginate without having to change back.<br />- Overall, the speed/snappiness of the device blows away the speed on the original nook + 1 update (i.e. the time when I ended up selling the nook). Page turning is near instant, the on/off speed and unlocking is far faster too. With one exception...<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br /><br />- The keyboard is pretty slow. Still. The infrared sensor that's used to detect touch requires a lot of patience and single-letter typing. This was really only an issue on initial setup for the wifi at my home. I honestly haven't used the keyboard in about a month. If I want to buy something, I do it via my phone's nook app, or the web.<br />-  While my battery life is good *now*, it wasn't so good when I first got it. I had to run it down completely a few times and recharge before I started getting anything near the 1-month advertised time. It's more like 2-3 weeks now that it's baked in, but that beats the original nook I had, and honestly, if you can't be troubled to charge the thing overnight once every 3 weeks, I'm not sure what to say. Buy a smartphone so you're conditioned to charge things more regularly :P<br />- The rubber on the device is great for grippiness in your hand (and it won't go sliding from anywhere you put it unless a 8.0 earthquake hits), but it tends to attract dust and grime, and the type of rubber makes it *incredibly* hard to clean except with some kind of wet nap.<br /><br />Overall, it's the original nook, in a smaller package, with better battery life, a touchscreen, and a cleaner interface.

0385732554|5.0|This book is an excellent read. It was recommended to me by a friend at church and when I started reading, I couldn't put it down! Now I pass the recommendation on to everyone reading this review. Grab a copy for yourself!
B004EPZ084|4.0|Before I went to see \\"Horrible Bosses,\\" I read a review which said that the movie celebrates the stereotypes it wanted to mock, and thus was not as subversive as it wished to be.  Luckily, I'm not capable of that level of sophisticated analysis, nor do I expect much out of a comedy released in July, so I found the movie very funny.       Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis and Charlie Day play three put-upon employees with evil bosses who regularly get together to commiserate.  At one point, someone suggests murder would be a good solution to their problems, and another suggests that if they murder each other's bosses, no one will be able to trace it.  Their bosses include a sexually predatory dentist  (Jennifer Aniston channeling Demi Moore in \\"Disclosure\\"); a twerpy amoral cokehead (Colin Farrell with a bad comb-over) and a company president who plays head games (Kevin Spacey, much better in \\"Swimming With Sharks\\").  Because they don't have much experience with this sort of thing, they wind up hiring Jamie Foxx.  Because Foxx's character (whose name I can't give here) doesn't either, things start to go awry.    Those who've seen the eighties' movie \\"9 to 5\\", starring Dolly Parton, Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, will recognize the storyline.  There are some Y2K twists, however, particularly at the end.  This movie, though, isn't trying to make any deep statements on gender politics in the workplace.  It's just trying to entertain.    I want to offer the heretical theory that most people enjoy seeing bullies get their just desserts, regardless of gender.  That's why I laughed at the movie, not because I think it's okay for women to harass men in the workplace or vice versa.  But if high jinks involving bodily fluids leave you cold, or politically incorrect humor makes you boil, then you should skip this one.
B00505470O|5.0|The long-awaited debut LP from Washed Out will not break the hearts of those who have been patiently waiting to consume more of his ethereal and gauzy soundscapes after getting just a taste from the brilliant \\"Life of Leisure\\" LP.  No...instead, they will fall even more in love with this underrated and largely unknown entity; he is taking the oft-abhorred, but appropriately-titled Chillwave genre to such great heights that he is looking down from the newly-created mountain top at all of the other pretenders who are trying to create grandiose sounds from minimal equipment.  \\"Within & Without\\" is that rare album that is meant for both intimate listening in your bedroom with your socks kicked off and a lover nearby, as it is for large spaces to leave the masses breathtaken with the intricate beauty of Ernest Greene's patient, delicate hands and his post-coital voice.  \\"Within & Without\\" is an extremely luxurious and well-constructed album, and while this record seems to be the obvious choice for the Sexiest Album of 2011, it also just might be the finest album of 2011, period.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|I have to start out saying I love their self title album and miss The Rev. My goal was to get all their old stuff, starting with this. At first I didn't find myself a big fan, but as time grew, this CD is pretty sweet.   First off, this isn't JUST thrash, even though a big part of it may seem like it. Yes, it is alot different than other metal, but that is why people, including, LOVE IT. If your a newer fan, you must get this album.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've had this watch for several months now and could not be more pleased.  After a few weeks of wear (automatic watches require some time to 'settle out' when they're new), it was keeping time within about 10 seconds a day.  The case is elegant in its simplicity.  The exhibition caseback is a nice touch.  The band is nothing remarkable, but it's pretty sturdy.<br /><br />As automatic watches go, it's hard to beat the quality for this price.  The Seiko 7S26B movement in this watch is generally regarded as 'bulletproof.'  I wear this watch everyday and work in pretty rough conditions for a watch and this has held up very well.  On one occasion, I snagged the watch on a pipe fitting so hard that the band snapped free and the watch fell about 3 feet onto a steel plate.  The impact dislodged the rotor in the watch (the piece that winds it when it's on your wrist).  I unscrewed the caseback, screwed the rotor back into place, and the watch is still keeping time within 10 seconds a day.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great watch.  I would recommend it for someone looking at their first automatic watch, as well as someone looking to add another watch to their collection.  I liked it so much I now own it in two other colors as well!

It really shows how they got to where they are today and the journey they went on through the years. RIP The Rev, we'll miss you forever.
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|As has been well documented, Brian Burton was a long-time fan of the soundtracks of the classic spaghetti westerns, and with Daniele Luppi has crafted a superb tribute to the music of Ennio Morricone and his contemporaries of that era. If you grew up watching Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef in the 60s as I did, or even if you just like the atmosphere of those oldies but goodies, you will absolutely love this CD.    The vocal tracks are all excellent, my favorite among them being Nora's sultry voice singing \\"Black,\\" but the real highlights of this disc are in my humble opinion the instrumentals. \\"Roman Blue,\\" \\"Her Hollow Ways\\" and \\"The Gambling Priest\\" as so superb at capturing the feel and ambience of those ageless soundtracks (without actually ripping off any particular one) that if I close my eyes I almost swear I can see a young Clint on horseback riding the Italian - er, Western - plains!

0553801473|3.0|Here's a radical suggestion: what if GRRM revived the serial tradition?  A monthly deadline would be a boon to us all; his doorstoppers are now both late AND disappointing.<br /><br />That rising howl you hear is the fan reaction to what may be charitably called \\"cliffhangers,\\" though perhaps \\"graceless plot interruptions\\" would be more apt.  Martin does the equivalent of chopping off A GAME OF THRONES right when Dany walks into the pyre instead of closing grandly on the morning after.  I'd recommend waiting 2 years for a library copy or waiting 10.5 years until the next installment.  In terms of long-term damage, the cliffhangers will force the next book to pick up the story just minutes after this one abruptly broke off.  Martin used to say that he wanted a 5-year gap so that the kids could grow older, but I don't see a clear path forward.<br /><br />In DANCE, we get plentiful descriptions of history, geography, and nipples (both color and size, quite reliably), but where's the actual story?  As a disappointingly apt analogy, FEAST:Brienne :: DANCE:Jon/Dany/Tyrion.<br /><br />--- SPOILER-FREE ---<br />Jon's interrupted arc => very CEO-like (reminiscent of Tyrion as Hand) with an illuminating POV chapter from Melisandre.<br /><br />Dany's bloated arc => a mess of fail on so many levels.  You only need to read her first and last chapters; the middle will only make you angry, confused, and inexplicably sleepy.<br /><br />Tyrion's meandering line => an unfinished fistful of novella that must have been lying around GRRM's desk.<br /><br />Theon's actual arc => the unexpected star of the show.<br /><br />Other people => a bare whisper of where Rickon is hiding, 11 lines on Brienne, 3 sad but beautiful Bran chapters, interesting looks at Jaime and Cersei, some unresolved Iron Islanders, and assorted useless Dornishmen (whose house words should be \\"The sun always fails\\").

As the series progresses it develops and expands its themes, introducing us to a parallel universe.<br /><br />The series has an excellent cast of actors ranging from the enigmatic Senior-Agent-In-Charge, Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick), to the principle FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), and civilian consultant Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and his father, Walter Bishop (John Noble), who is a scientist previously incarcerated in a mental hospital.<br /><br />The blu-ray version looks great with its rich blacks and deep colors.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|A Stolen Life by Jaycee Lee Duggard    There are books that resonate with you, books you'll always remember because there is something in them that touches something in you. The Bell Jar by Slyvia Plath, Kindred by Octavia Butler, and Bastard out of Carolina by Dorothy Allison are some of the books I will always remember. I've just added A Stolen Life by Jaycee Lee Duggard to this collection. It's a beautifully written, and chilling narrative account of eighteen years of captivity through the eyes of the child Jaycee was and the adult (still somewhat child-like) she's become.       I read this memoir in one day. As I usually do with narratives dealing with abuse, I tried to rush through it. I'm of the whole `ripping the bandaid off' mentality so I wanted to read it, get through it, and know this brave woman's story. Instead, I found myself re-reading certain parts because I was so shocked and disgusted I couldn't believe what I'd read.     The chapter \\"The First Time\\" made me sick to my stomach. It is an appropriate name for that chapter because it is a first for both Jaycee and the reader (well me personally). I can't remember reading anything so graphically disturbing, and this chapter sets the tone of the memoir. At eleven years old, Jaycee Lee is not only kidnapped and enslaved, she's forced to lose her virginity to a psychotic pervert in a backyard hovel. I know it will get worse from there, and I'm numb, and not as shocked but still disgusted, when I read about Phillip Garrido's drug-induced `runs.' Runs are moments of time (days) when the monster acts out his fantasies on a helpless little girl. They are so despicable, you will cry.     And though this book is centered around the abuse done to an innocent child, it is also about hope, acceptance and unwavering love. Jaycee Lee Duggard is a remarkable human being. For someone who's experienced hell, she has a remarkably hopeful outlook on life. She loves animals, she loves her daughters, and she loves the family the monster ripped her from, so when she smiles and her eyes grow bright with happiness, it's because of them. Jaycee says she doesn't `hate' the monster and his enabling wife who is as much a monster as he, because to do so would give them power of her. So instead, she smiles, and laughs, and tries to focus on the positive.     In her \\"Reflections\\" (which come after each chapter), Jaycee states that she doesn't know why she didn't leave sooner, but I believe the reason is tied to Jaycee's overwhelming instinct to survive. Already shy, at 11, Jaycee relearned the world through the eyes of a predator and pervert, and in it, she was the prey. The monster had a stun-gun that could shock her into paralysis, and supposed dogs that patrolled outside, and later, when she was older, he was her protector from the `evil' outside world. So Jaycee adapted, and in the adaptation, grew complacent. I've read comments from many people asking why she didn't just leave once she was older, and that answer seems so simple after reading her memoir. She didn't know how. It was the monster's world, and she was simply trying to survive.     When she was taken, Jaycee didn't know right from wrong, good from bad, in terms of relationships. The monster assumed so many roles that she couldn't help but be confused: rapist, molester, torturer, father, friend and protector. As I read this story, and all of the depraved things done to Jaycee Lee's body with hardly a complaint from her, I get the feeling in my heart that if Jaycee had protested or rebelled as many wanted her to, she wouldn't be alive today to share this tale with us.     After finishing the book, I just want to give her a big hug for writing this story because there are countless children/adults who've suffered abuse and are silent about it. There's a shame that's heaped onto victims of sexual predators and this memoir cracked it. In the narrative, she says the reason she wrote this down was because she wasn't keeping `their' secret anymore. I wanted to cheer. The shame isn't the victims'. It's the abusers'.   Jaycee Lee Duggard wrote with unflinching precision, and gave us a glimpse into eighteen years of abuse, neglect, and brain-washing. I sincerely hope that Jaycee has nothing but good fortune for the rest of her life. She's endured for eighteen years what many of us couldn't. For those who say `she could have freed herself sooner,' perhaps, perhaps not. In situations like these, we outsiders can say whatever we think because we are thinking with a different mindset. The truth is, were you in Jaycee's shoes, you have no idea what you could or would have done to ensure survival.
1451629184|5.0|Amazing woman and amazing book. I have special interest in Jaycee and her story. I lived in So. Lake Tahoe when she was abducted and lived about 3 miles from her family. I did not know her. Her abduction ripped our town apart. I desparetely wanted to read this book and read it in one day. She was torn from her mother when she was 11 years old and lived a horrific existence. I could not put this book down. she has an amazing outlook and is such a survivior. Jaycee I am so glad you are home!!!!
0553583182|5.0|This book, along with several others, are a must read for everyone wanting a better life. I started my journey into New Thought principles (the common name given to books that deal with the subconscious) several years ago, and have been steadily working away at nurturing a prosperity mindset. However, after reading this and the book [[ASIN:B0038HEYF4 Statue in the Square]] (by Joanne St.Clair ) everything seemed to click into place. It worked, because just before Xmas I won several hundred thousand pounds on the National Lottery after applying the techniques covered in both books (notably visualisation, faith, positive thinking etc).     Buy this book and apply. It will change your life x
B000QR4WO2|5.0|The last album before Tarja was summarily dismissed from the group for being able to make an otherwise average band great. Unless they patch things up somewhere down the line, Nightwish will never sound this good again.
0811879542|5.0|In an age of everything being \\"interactive\\", this is a charming twist on the theme.  So far, we have never been able to read it through just once.  Good fun for everyone.
1451629184|5.0|I got this book last night and couldn't put it down.  It is well-written and insightful.  Parts of the book are painful to read because of the abuse that she endured.  The book  gives the reader a glimpse of Jaycee's 18 years of captivity, and then she talks about her new life and freedom.   Towards the beginning of the book she writes about some of the wishes she had when she was in captivity, and it's extremely gratifying to see that she has a new life with so much freedom and friendship, and that some of her biggest dreams have come true.  I started crying  tears of joy when I looked on Amazon and saw that she was #1 on the bestseller list.  I am so happy for her.  This book is highly recommended.  I wish that I could meet Jaycee in person and tell her what an amazing human being she is.
B004SBQALA|2.0|This was such a terrible movie. It was like a straight to video high school film with great special effects. So So acting with teen cheesy lines. I'm glad I didn't purchase this movie, I rented it from Netflix. lacking in Special features as well, only the standard \\"Deleted scenes and bloopers\\" reel. You would think with Blu-Ray disc being able to fit 50GBs of data that most movies would have a behind the scenes documentary. I will say this, if you are going to get it be sure to get the Blu-Ray because there is a huge difference, The animation was amazing. I will give the movie that.     I like this director D.J Curuso, he did Eagle Eye which was a great film. And Timothy Olyphant was good in this, not his best role but he stood out.    In short: Waste of time, but if you really want to see it rent it.
0553801473|5.0|Just finished this, I think it's way better than FfC, but not as great as the first three books. It also really brings Feast up as well, since they are parallel novels.<br /><br />Some of the complaints I have is that it's similar to Feast in terms of plotline, but if you are patient, it pays off well in the end.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Don't fall for the venomous fanboy reviews... all those people who gave it a 1 star review are still going to buy it, and that's why they hate themselves.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Where is Travis and can we clone him? Loved this book! There is something about the very bad boy that falls hard and fast for a great girl and can't win her over right away! If you are looking for a romance novel that has a bad boy with a strong personality, a good girl with a secret past, a few twists and turns, and a big twist...this is your book! Travis falls for Abby so hard and fast, the whole school is talking. He also has quite a jealous streak and is a bit possessive/overprotective about Abby, but who wouldn't feel safe in his ginormous arms? I read it more than once and loved every minute of it! With so many good reviews, I took a chance and was left wanting a sequel to continue following their story!    In a nutshell - Abby goes to Eastern U. with her BFF to escape from her past and meets Travis in a unique situation. He is a bad boy who has a new flavor of the week (or flavors sometimes), and meets a girl who doesn't worship him or throw herself at his feet. He is intrigued and breaks out of his mold of \\"no girls that are friends\\" to get to know Abby. Their friendship becomes close and has a few missteps, not to mention Abby's lack of mention about her past and another potential date-worthy guy fawning over her. Well, the past always catches up and manages to complicate the present. Does everything turn out ok? Can't tell you that, read the book!
B000002H5I|5.0|This was released in 1988 and was an excellent first album. All the songs had wonderful lyrics and music,and the lyrics represented her feelings about several subjects. I found this and wonderful first try which led to more great music by her.

1451629184|5.0|\\"A light that I thought had been extinguished was slowly coming back to life.\\"<br /><br />An incredible story of hope and survival written by an incredible woman. Unlike many victims, she has not kept their secrets. She has exposed them for who they are: MONSTERS. Her story is inspiring, humbling, and terrifyingly disturbing. I have no doubt that it will inspire others, provoke change, and elicit hope for other families. There are other children and adults that are missing and perhaps still alive somewhere -- maybe even in plain site in someone's back yard. Considering her limited education and exposure the outside world her writing is superb. I was expecting something much more elementary in nature. She has clearly used every resource she could find to further educate herself and her young children. 5 STARS for Dugard. She deserves every dime she profits and every star she accumulates. I wish her and her children the best.
0439023513|5.0|This final installment of THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy was AMAZING!  Well written with all the horrors of war as they really would happen.  Emotions or lack thereof clearly defined.  The really sad thing is that I can actually see something like this happening.  Let's hope it NEVER does.  Killing off children for amusement is so sick.  MOCKINGJAY begins with Katniss and Finnick rescued and taken to district 13 while Peeta and the others are left to the Capitol after the Quarter Quell.  District 13 wants Katniss to become the Mockingjay aka face of the rebellion.  She isn't sure what she's going to do until she sees how the Capitol is torturing Peeta to get at her.  She agrees pending several agreements with Coin including freeing those prisoners from the Quell and granting them immunity.    Will give no more info.  This is a MUST read!
B001IYCMNA|1.0|Complete plastic cheap parts, this wireless access point crapped out after upgrading the BIOS to the latest version from the Cisco site.  Downloading the file was a pain and the site is terrible to navigate.  I've spent hours trying to get this back up, from using the factory reset button, etc...  Cisco makes crap - its just linksys with a Cisco logo on it now.  When navigating the interface items are missing from the browser view, tried both Firefox and IE, still items missing, checkboxes not able to check.  Complete garbage.

0762759437|5.0|The wife is mad at me, so this book did its job... :-)  Now we have hundreds of more places to eat at when we make our annual pilgrimage to NYC, meaning thousands of more tasty calories to cram into our bodies. Good thing we walk so much when we're there. Highly highly highly recommended for folks who want to cram thousands of more tasty calories into their bodies when in NYC. It also lists directions from subways, and, with its small size, it fits conveniently into her purse, so she can whip it out if we need to should my direction sense go south...
B002BX4VEK|5.0|When Elvis got out of the army he quit the rebelious rock n roll and settled into his love of his family and pretty love songs and puppy-dog type of sentimental songs and movies. This cd is a very good example of his home life and friends and community as he grew up. Rock n rollers- weep for your own loss when Elvis really started to teach the world how to love- our gain.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|I've owned two of these tuners for several months now, and after several indoor and outdoor shows (and occasionally hard stomping from our guitarist during practices), they are still going strong. They seem to be a bit slow registering notes a few seconds after being turned on, but afterward they pick up guitar notes almost as soon as you pick them. They also work fairly well with my bass, though they have some issues with the bass guitar's low E string. I'd recommend getting the Behringer 9V power supply for it and covering up its bright power light (seriously, it's bright!) with a piece of tape, but otherwise what you get for the price cannot be beat. Oh, and be sure that you are using a mono (TS) cable going into its input; it won't register or turn on with a fully connected stereo (TRS) cable. You can use either type of cable through its \\"Bypass\\" and \\"Out\\" outputs, however.

B004H1V5RU|4.0|The Perplexus Epic is so much fun but i will have to say it is for advanced players only. I recommend getting the regular version or rookie before attempting this one. Overall its a great toy and an awesome addition to the ongoing Perplexus series. I can also guarantee you will get frustrated but that's all part of the Perplexus experience.
0345522478|4.0|Great job on your first book, Kevin. A nice bit of escapist fiction. I'm looking forward to the arrival of the next two books in the set. Keep up the good work!
B004EPYZU8|1.0|This movie is hard to watch.  The director's disdain for women is apparent, and beyond that, the narrative is poorly constructed, and the film is boring.    Don't waste your money.
B0034G4ORM|3.0|This movie is beyond cliché...I mean way beyond. I'm going to guess the writer and director assumed that the only experience the audience has ever had with the military is watching Full Metal Jacket and Black Hawk Down. It's a mind numbing experience to have to listen to Eckhart's character constantly give pep talks to every single person around him for fear they would just give up. The main focus point of the action is to show you a glimpse of an alien and then show you five minutes of explosions. I get it, I really do, but I was hoping for more with this movie. For what was hyped to be some sort of monumental blockbuster this movie fails to present one original idea. The dialogue feels very forced in most scenes of the movie as it trudges forward to its inevitable conclusion. And that conclusion...well without giving away a major plot detail, but really that's how you kill the invaders, REALLY? This is your typical cookie cutters, for the masses, let me spell everything out for you while I hold your hand type of movie. Don't get me completely wrong, I understand the appeal of this movie. It's loud, big, and sometimes even halfway interesting. The much hated \\"shaky camera\\" scenes didn't bother me that much.   The blu ray transfer quality of the movie isnt spectacular, but its not terrible either. The extras on the blu ray are one of the only redeeming factors of the movie. I really enjoyed the PS3 Resistance 3 demo and the various \\"making of\\" shorts included. Unfortunately once again we find ourselves subjected to listening to actors talk about how hard the two-three week boot camp they had to endure for filming preparation.   Overall the plot didn't live up to the hype. The story isn't well written and most of the time I felt like the scenes that attempted sincere dialogue were in slow motion. After watching the early previews for the movie I had hope this movie could stand out among the other science fiction classics. Unfortunately this movie misses the mark bya mile.
0316069884|5.0|I had read great reviews of this book, but kept procrastinating over reading it myself for fear that I would want to go vegetarian. I ended up experiencing an epiphany of other sorts which caused that to happen, but this was the first book I picked up to read after making the decision to go vegetarian.  This book sealed my decision.  It is a must-read for anyone who cares about where their food comes from or about animal welfare.
B004UA8D2S|2.0|So yeah, saw the preview and of course James Cameron's (Alien's, the Abyss, and Terminator 2) name attached to it and felt pretty confident this would be a well done thriller. Well, looks were deceiving in this case. First off, this is one of the worst blu ray transfers I have ever seen. Most of the visuals were still amazing, but it was disappointing that they were grainy. Second, the acting and writing here is extremely poor. It's hard to care about any of the characters or believe they are actually in peril when you're constantly cringing. Third, the story never reaches its potential...it doesn't do enough to hold an audience for more than five minutes at a time. I understand that the intent was to make a realistic movie, but come on, even if they had thrown in some cheesy cave monster or some tribe of underground cavemen at least the movie have been interesting. I'm not saying that this movie necessarily needed a major plot change...it's just that I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen that would make me care, it never did. I am relieved that I picked up a used blu ray copy rather than spending over $20 for a new copy I will probably end up giving away.     The blu ray extras where nothing to get excited about. There is a short documentary featuring the actors and of course James Cameron talking about the making of the film. Most of which centers around the actors talking about their experience working with green screen/CGI technology and whining about how difficult the stunts were.    In the end this is a movie you can feel free to skip. If you really want to see a movie about people trapped in caves then considers the movie \\"The Descent\\".
B004K4AUZW|5.0|It seems pointless to write extensive comments about a soul dominating eternal masterpiece.   Although the previous albums hadn't impressed me much as a whole apart from the hit singles, all the signs showed that a beyond belief monument of pop music was about  to arrive.  Well, it did!    Lady Gaga didn't gain with this album the throne of the pop stardom; she had done so by the second album already.   This time establishes herself as the undisputedly greatest pop icon of all time (I 'm in an age where I can remember all the previous ones...!)It took 30 years to find someone definitely capable to dethrone the previous queen (you can imagine who exactly I am refering to) but finally it's done!    The queen is dead. Long live the queen !

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I went into this book expecting to hear just details about what Phillip has done to Jaycee, but I was surprised when it was like living life through Jaycee`s eyes. So real and raw and full of emotion. It really is a must read to truly understand the situation. couldn`t put it down.
0060936223|5.0|For years, my impression of Patti Smith was as a tough, uncompromising, and difficult person tied to and driven by her art. Horses, of course, is a beloved milestone, but Easter and Wave (just to name two others) are tough works of beauty. She's definitely someone to admire, someone whose work I cherish, but not someone I expected to warm to.    Two events changed that. She visited San Francisco a few years ago and played Horses in its entirety and she was incredibly engaging and charismatic. Her work, and her words, were about being human, being loving. And Just Kids completes that picture.    This spirit infuses Just Kids. It is a tale of kids, finding their way in New York, growing up, making mistakes both amusing and tragic, with a shared and rather complex love. There's much to relate to and enjoy here and it's a warmly told tale. It's also a tale of artists (big A, small a) and how their art was a living breathing part of everything they were. For all its simplicity and humanity, and complete lack of airs or pretension, I always had the sense that these truly were artists - they're not me, they're not you, they're not poets working 9 to 5 or celebrities who create a good song or two every so often. No, Patti and Robert were and remain the artist as unique, as other. Both to be valued. Both human.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Once I began I could not stop reading, or crying. The book has me contemplating my marriage, my children, and all of our futures. I wish I knew a few more people who read it because I'd love to discuss some of the finer points, but I won't spoil the book here. (I hate when that happens in a review.) I will say that the entire book is from Alice's point of view and written perfectly.
1451629184|5.0|I ran out to get this book because I wanted to show support to Jaycee in some small way... The details in the book are extremely difficult to read, but it is so well written that I couldn't put it down.  Jaycee, you go girl!  So happy for you and your family.
B000002N1E|1.0|This album typifies Prince's output in the 1990's. Corny and cheesy.  The segues in and of themselves are cringe-worthy enough, but the music at this period in Prince's career was that of a lost artist haphazardly chasing trends.  He was completely out of touch and sales of this record reflect that. There is a small minority of Prince fans that like this record, but unless you are a connoisseur of cheesy pop, or a completist, I would advice to skip this record and most of Prince's 90's output.
0545259088|4.0|After reading Shiver and Linger in less than two days, I started Forever right away, dying to know what would occur next. Would Sam and Grace find a way to be together? Would Cole find the cure? Would Isabel and Cole ever get together as well? There were a myriad of questions in my head. Thankfully, Forever answered the majority of them and provided yet another addition of the Wolves of Mercy Fall series I adored.     It's been a couple of months since Grace turned into a wolf, leaving Sam, Isabel, and everyone else behind until the summer. In the meanwhile, Sam has been picking up the pieces Grace left behind, and counting the days until his summer girl becomes his once again. Cole, on the other hand, has been working on the wolf cure, hoping this time he will get it right finally. Then the day comes...Grace becomes a human for the warm season once again. However, there's danger in the air, as Isabel's father has declared all the wolves will be dead in a couple of weeks. Knowing they can't let the wolves lose their lives, Grace, Isabel, Sam, and Cole team up to save the day, but will their plan work? More importantly, will they be able to find a cure before it's too late? Only time and more pages can tell in this fast paced conclusion!    Just like in the two previous additions, one of my favorite aspects of Forever was the characters. All four main characters grew and developed more than ever. Sam begins to overcome his fears, and becomes stronger because of it. Grace is dealing with her new wolf half with new feelings towards it, ones she didn't think she would have- I enjoyed seeing how this played into her character. Isabel begins to become a little less ice queen-ish, and once again, that wit and sarcasm is out for all to see. More development is given into Cole's past, and he begins to become just a little more human.     More importantly, the relationships and friendships they have formed do much of the same- grow and thrive. I loved seeing more into Grace and Sam's relationship, even if there was some sulking involved. Cole and Isabel also begin to move in the right direction, and I loved that- it probably was one of my favorite parts of the book!     The plot in this was also fantastic, especially the last hundred and so pages. For the majority of the book, I had no clue how everything was going to end, and I liked that a lot. Maggie's writing was yet again beautiful and stunning- once again painting a vivid picture. This book even made me cry a little in some places, especially towards the end- I still get a little sad thinking about it!    The ending...there's been some debate it whether or not it was too open-ended, just the right amount, or some cases a little too tied up. I'm somewhere between just the right amount and too open-ended. I liked that Maggie left some questions up in the air with just the right amount of hope and I can see why she did it, but in some ways, I wish some clearer answers were provided.     Regardless, Forever is yet another amazing addition to the Wolves of Mercy Falls series. I'm going to miss Isabel, Cole, Sam, and Grace, but I'm still holding out for a continuation someday. Until then I'm eagerly awaiting Maggie's future books, starting with the already buzzed about Scorpio Races.       Grade: A-

0545123267|4.0|Shiver is yet another one of those books that I bought ages ago due to all the fabulous praise it had been getting as well as my love of Maggie's previous book Lament. However, not until recently did I pick it up and try it. I was blown away to say the least...and now I am beginning to feel bad about not reading this series sooner.    Werewolves are not my favorite topic in YA by far. I have never really seen the intrigue behind them, because to me they have always been furry, vicious beast so seriously what is there to love about them? However, Shiver changed this for me, as not only did I love seeing how the wolves' world worked but how it tied into the plot in many fabulous and unique ways.    The characters in this were another great aspect. I instantly adored and rooted for Grace because not only do we share one common love (books), but she's also someone you can't help but like, as while she's shy and timid, she's also fierce and protective of her friends if it comes down to it. Sam, on the other hand, has faced his own problems in this past, and because of it, he still comes off as lost and distant, but that did not stop me from liking and rooting for him as well. His relationship with Grace was also another high point, and it was actually one romance in YA, that I actually found believable and realistic, even given the somewhat fast-paced nature of it. It just worked perfectly to say the least for some reason.    Last but not least, Maggie Stiefvater's writing ROCKED in this. She has such an amazing way of bringing out vivid pictures as well as intense feeling in her writing- it is almost poetic in a sense. To tell the truth I loved every single moment of it!     Romantic and beautifully written, Shiver is well worth a read for a variety of reasons. Don't pull a Lauren, and take forever to read it. Instead, pick it up now, as I am sure you will love it just as much as me, especially if you are in any way a romantic.    Grade: B+
0143038419|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I'm not a reader of novels, per se, but I found it to be very entertaining, funny and also reflective and deep. I picked it up from the library and then had to buy my own copy. I'm now reading it again and underlining things that touched me personally. It made me laugh and also brought me to tears. It's a travel book and so much more. It's a journey of self-discovery, romance, dedication and love. The way the author was very discriptive of the landscapes of each country, emotion and people. I do most of my traveling in books and this was a very educational and informative trip. I felt I could taste the food in Italy; the coolness of the spirit-filled Ashram with the chantings of the mantras, and the romantic surroundings of Bali.   This is one of those books whose movie I then had to rent and I enjoyed it very much also. The soundtrack isn't bad either with Eddie Vedder singing The Long Road. Yeah.
0545123283|4.0|After reading Shiver, I dove into this one not even ten minutes later, because if I knew one thing it was that I wasn't going to wait another million years to read this one. Thankfully, Linger was even better than Shiver, as not only did it introduce some fabulous new main characters as well their own POVs but even more development into a series I'm starting to adore even more!<br /><br />In Shiver, Sam and Grace's star-crossed romance was introduced, and in Linger, it continues with even more steam. As I said in my review for Shiver above, I really adore the relationship Sam and Grace have because it's surprisingly real, in my opinion. I can honestly see the connection between them as well as how much they adore and love each other- it's more than just lust to say the least.<br /><br />In Linger, Isabel and Cole, a new werewolf, were introduced, and I have to say I'm starting to like their characters even more Sam and Grace's. I love how blunt and sarcastic Isabel is, and Cole, a former rock star, is even more so that way. Together they were simply hilarious with their witty banter, and with the obvious sexual tension between them, I'm now rooting for an Isabel and Cole relationship!<br /><br />The writing in Linger was even more beautiful than the writing in Shiver amazingly enough, and when tied to together with all the twists and turns as well as that shocking ending, it provided quite the punch, in my opinion.<br /><br />Fabulous, witty, and well written, Linger is yet another satisfying addition to the Wolves of Mercy Falls series!<br /><br />Grade: B+
B004Y1USV2|5.0|This album just blows me away. I LOVE the new guy. The harmonies here are just beautiful. Arrangements are wonderful. And to those saying Yes needs Rick and Jon-----well---just give a listen. I love Rick and Jon as much as any die-hard Yes fan, but time marches on and so must the band. Buy it ! You' ll love it !
B000MRAAJM|3.0|Sorry for the 3 stars...but it say it come with spanish, English an French subtitles and did not....only English, y verdaderamente queria tener los subtitulos en Espa&ntilde;ol.<br />Una lastima.....<br /><br />Por lo demas es un 5 estrellas.
B001TH8UUA|4.0|Sure, you can pay $140 for an HDMI cable at a big-box retailer, or you can buy one of these from this seller and save about $125-130.  Your choice.  This cable works perfectly.  I bought several for my house.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I saw this in a theater when it came out...I went to a late show, and there were only a couple of others in the theater. What an experience! Scared out of my mind and intrigued at the same time. I consider myself kind of a horror/sci-fi connoisseur, and in my opinion, this is an instant classic that will be a favorite for the rest of my life.<br /><br />The music. If the music doesn't creep you out, you may not be alive at all. Screeching and wailing violins...all placed in just the right parts of the film. Not since Goldsmith's 'Alien' score has there been such a perfect horror soundtrack. And even the 'Tiny Tim' song strangely works just right.<br /><br />The old lady in the window and the other 'spirits'. The old lady in the window is absolute nightmare fuel. That is the kind of ghost that kept me up at night as a child. There are a variety of menacing characters about as well. At least one of them is sure to get to you.<br /><br />The story. The story is very creative and original. The story does explain just about everything that happens...which I found very refreshing. The actors played their roles well, and the film has a good flow to it. The film feels very polished and not hurried at all.<br /><br />Buy this movie! Rent it! Watch it alone in the dark or with someone else during the day. Whatever you have do!!! See it! I wanted to go right back into the theater when it was over and watch it again! I even pre-ordered it as soon as I got home!!! All hail INSIDIOUS!
0002247399|3.0|I read a lot.  I read a lot of fiction, non fiction, classics, literature, manuals, blah, blah, blah.  I own thousands of books.  when i was younger I would read a book through no matter how bad, as I have gotten older and had more demands on my time, I've realised the folly in this so gladly toss aside a book that is worthless and shun authors who have disappointed me too often.<br /><br />I might read Winds of Winter if it comes out and if I have not decided to read something else at the time.  I enjoyed a Game a Thrones and a Clash of Kings and a Storm of Swords.  I slogged through Feast but could not re-read it.  I struggled through Dance and will not waste time re-reading it.  I could give a synopsis of this 959 page book in less than 5000 words and none of them would be used describing the menu or the wine or the beer.<br /><br />This series suffers from the lack of a decent editor who would look at the pages and cut them by 75% and tell Martin to tighten things up, to get to the story, to dispense with tricks and cliff hangers and, again, get to the story.<br /><br />Feast showed us the story had gotten away from Martin.  Dance shows us he is still not sure what to do, where to go, how to proceed.  Both Feast and Dance could have been combined, as was originally planned, into one book and that book could have been less than 500 pages and we would have cried out for more rather than plodding through a tired replay of feasts and argument and schemes we've seen many too many times before.<br /><br />A good editor would have kept Martin focused on the story but editors lose the spine when an author becomes popular and they let any old POS get published as long as there is a ready audience to snap it up and cry for more.<br /><br />I came to the series late.  I got Game and Clash for $4 as single book.  I bought Storm for $6ish, I believe I paid $12ish for Feast and I pro-ordered Dance for around $15.  My initial $10 investment was sound.  My later $27 was not.<br /><br />Others have said, nothing happens in this book.  I disagree.  We get about 100 pages of story.  The problem is that there are 959 pages in the book and teasing the story from these pages is tiresome work./><br />Others have said, nothing happens in this book.  I disagree.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|This was an excellent price for a brand-new, still shrink-wrapped season of one of my favorite shows. It was shipped immediately and arrived promptly. The only problem was that two out of the four DVDs had slight manufacturing errors, which caused a little skipping, but i don't think that was the seller's fault.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It is amazing how good of a person Jaycee turn out to be dispite the horrendous ordeal she went through.  She always seems to be thinking of everyone else and what is best for them rather than herself. So many people use their childhood as an excuse for how they act, yet what Jaycee went through was unimaginable horror and she is still a very good person.  400 years plus is not near enough punishment for Phillip, not to mention the slap on the wrist Nancy received.  Our punishments need to be more harsh so it is actually deters people from committing such crimes.  I wish the best for Jaycee and her family and I am sure this book will help many others who have suffered at the hands of others.
B001DJ69E8|5.0|I've always thought this kind of music must be somewhere.  Now that I've found it and the other related 'trailer' artists...I like it.  I plan on buying more.  Definitely recommend if you listen to and like the samples.
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|Game is alright, but having to accept let alone read the EULA is crazy. There are other games out there a lot more fun.
0553801473|3.0|Decent enough book, but I feel like Martin has walked into the same trap Jordan did with the Wheel of Time. To many new characters, not enough resolution. And once again some major cliffhangers. Cliffhangers are fine when they still complete arcs, not when they leave them unfinished as some have been.
B00407PNY2|4.0|I disagree with one of the other posters.  I hadn't seen this movie in along time.  When I first saw it, I had to sneak in to a theater with some friends to see it.  Now I'm a young 'un, only 57.  But, even though I discovered some of the chase scene trickery, I still think this is a good movie after all these years.  This, of course, was pre-green screen goofy-ness... and that can only be a good thing, eh?  :-D
B00005NUZM|5.0|After over 30 years I have finally gotten around to buying this album. I shouldn't have waited so long because I like it even better than I thought I would. When I hear \\"Rock With You\\" it takes me straight back to the very end of the 70's & the very beginning of the 80's when I was a teenager. This album had 2 surprises for me: his cover of Paul McCartney's \\"Girlfriend\\" is far better than Paul's own version on his 1978 album \\"London Town\\". This was apparently the first collaberation between Paul & Michael, that later created \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" & \\"Say,Say,Say\\" & Michaels's ownership of the Beatles songs. Another surprise was \\"I Can't Help It\\", a beautiful song written by Stevie Wonder. When he sings it, Michael sounds almost like Stevie himself. Only thing missing is the harmonica. The one thing I could have done without is the interviews with producer Quincy Jones & Rod Temperton of Heatwave, who wrote some of the songs. Not that I'm not interested in what they say, I would have rather read their comments in the liner notes where they belong. I buy CDs to hear music, not talk. But another surprise in hearing the interview is that the guy from Heatwave has a British accent, sounds a little like Ringo Starr. I did not know that Heatwave was a British band.
B0000025AI|5.0|The cd came perfectly came to me, no damages and very soon, considering the distance between my home and the USA!  This cd is a very nice and inspirated piece of the most pure texas blues.  If you like electric blues, you must have it.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I love this app and use it often as I listen to a few out of state stations, as well as internet radio (shoutcast) streams quite a bit. It would be amazing if the widget was 4x1 instead of 4x2 and centered vertically. I'd like that other space please.
B0053F042G|4.0|*Spoiler*  The main part of this movie is gripping and well done, but the tag on happy ending? Puhleeze...There are so many things wrong with that plot 'twist' that I don't know where to begin. How about the fact that some poor teacher had his body taken over because he died but, wait a minute, really he didn't. So what happened to him? Oh well, up until then I was enjoying it. The supporting cast were great, the interactions realistic, and the suspense believable.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I've seen some of my friends using this product so I decided to try it out. I'm glad I purchased it. It helps to reduce shaky filming and makes it just a breeze to carry around and film with.
B0058P7KUA|1.0|I understand that honeycomb and android tablets are new and there is not a whole lot of support yet for them, but it would be nice if the developer would mention compatibility issues in the product description.
0553801473|4.0|Its great to be reading this series, I've waited years for this and my memories of the houses, alliances, battles ect. are slowly coming back to me.  However the fact is that he waited too long, I have to feel that Martin did a lot of rewriting recently because the first about 15 chapters are largely dedicated to reminding the reader what happened in the past novels after his abysmally long hiatus (he does a very smooth job in the literary sense of patching together flashbacks and character memories but for this complex a series 8 or 9 years is too long between formative events)  I keep having memories of events and characters come flooding back but I know some characters and events have become fuzzy in my mind and it detracts from the vividness of the world he is creating.<br /><br />Martin's prose are as descriptive and vivid as ever, his sense of strategy keeps you feeling stimulated and involved in his world, but I get the feeling that Martin is digging in and preparing to milk and stretch out this series as long as possible.  I have read fantasy writers in the past (ahem Robert Jordan) who started strong but by the third novel were obviously flying by the seat of their pants/ making it up as they went with no preponderant structure or end scenario planned/ slowing down the story to a crawl to milk more $$ out of the name they established.  Martin is head and shoulders above Jordan or any other recent fantasy writers but I really hope he has a plan for this series and doesn't try to \\"Harry Potter\\" A Song of Fire and Ice, he has to be rolling in $$ after his HBO series and I think I trust his integrity.  I am about a third of the way through this book and frankly I have to say not a whole lot has happened but it is great to be back in Westeros after all these years!
0439813786|4.0|Hugo Cabret is an orphan, living in a Paris train station, and trying to keep from being discovered.  He has become obsessed with a broken clockwork figure, spending hours studying diagrams and other clockworks so that he can repair it.<br /><br />Needing pieces, and having no money with which to purchase them, he steals small clockwork figures from a toy stall in the station.  When he is caught by the toymaker, his world takes a drastic turn, filling Hugo's life with mystery and adventure.<br /><br />Selznick's novel is the first (and so far, only) novel to win a Caldecott award, an honor more usually given to picture books.  This is because The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a story told in pictures as well as words; the initial forty-five pages are illustrations, moving the story along breathlessly, before the first word is read.  These two-page illustrations are a hand-drawn visual delight.  In addition, as the story blends history with fiction beautifully, Selznick includes still photographs from the story's era, as well as frames from the silent movies that figure so prominently in the plot.<br /><br />The prose does not equal the magnificence of the illustrations, sadly.  It is awkward at points, with sometimes stiff dialogue and a not-always-believable plot line.  That is overshadowed by the beauty of the art, though, and by the historical elements Selznick has woven into his fiction.<br /><br />While certainly not a literary masterpiece, the visual experience of The Invention of Hugo Cabret  makes this a book well worth reading.
0920668372|2.0|I received this book at a Baby Shower with many ladies singing the praises over the sweet words...\\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be\\". At first, I found this book quite touching, especially because the woman reading the story to us was using so much warmth and inflection in her voice.<br /><br />However, when it got to the page where the mother in the story was crawling into her baby's room I wondered why she didn't just walk in quietly as he was sleeping. Alright, so no big deal...right? But later, the same mom climbs in the window of her adult son's room and this is where it got a little too creepy for me. Another woman in the room jokingly teased about this \\"stalker mom\\" and I had to agree with her humorous assessment.<br /><br />Although, with due respect to the book, the story ends on such a sweet note with the baby, turned boy, and now a man caring for his aging mother. That being said, I won't be reading this story to my little one, but I know so many others who adore this book and would highly recommend it.
0064410935|5.0|Charlotte's Web is White's classic story about the friendship of a pig, a girl and a spider.  Fern saves Wilbur, the runt of the litter, from an untimely death, and hand raises him.  When he is too big to stay with Fern, her uncle buys him, with the intent of enjoying pork all winter.  Wilbur makes a friend in his new home, an intelligent and kind spider named Charlotte.  Charlotte makes it her life's goal to save Wilbur, regardless of the costs to herself.  It is a novel of friendship, of life and death, and of the power of the written word.<br /><br />Though White's prose is perfect, it is sometimes clinical, lacking some of the more exciting literary devices that make prose pop and sparkle.  His understanding of ten year old girls seems a bit lacking, but his ability to detail farm life and spider behavior make the animal characters and background come alive.  I can't help but wish Fern's character had been more rounded out, and that she had played more a part later in the story, but White's focus was on the barnyard and not on the human players.<br /><br />Rereading Charlotte's Web is like visiting an old friend: it stays the same but yet there is always something new as well.  This time was no different, and I was newly impressed with White's message on the importance of words and language.  As always, I found his depiction of true friendship to be beautiful and moving.<br /><br />Despite any minor complaints I may have, Charlotte's Web is a warm, funny, and real book and deservedly a classic.
0743487486|5.0|This book was the first book I read and thought. This is it. This is the answer to my parenting questions. It helped me to understand more how children are and it helped me to realise that respecting children is a must and that this is where most family problems arise. It showed me that children are so valuable and that most adults do not trust them enough or give them credit. When I started to put into practice having no rewards or punishments I noticed incredible changes in my children that I will never look back. Our children are now loving, honest and secure individuals who we trust and respect. the change has been so amzing and significant I can only imagine how wonderful (and how much less we would worry about drugs etc) society would look like if all families treated their children in this unconditional way.
B001CDL6YS|2.0|I can go on and on about how amazing the album and the band is but for some reason the record I recieved was falty.  The final song, \\"In the Presence of Enemies Part 2\\" wasn't on it for some reason. Instead \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\" appeared a second time in place of it.  Hopefully for anyone else's sake, this was just an error on my product and no other ones.  We'll see when I get a replacement for it.
1594202710|3.0|This lengthy tome is worth slogging through just to better understand how exactly we got to a place where a despotic, communist regime is about to eclipse the US economically and challenge us militarily. Mr. Kissinger should be ashamed rather than smug, but like so many he actually doesn't seem to get it.    When you are done, try \\"Death by China\\" (Navarro and Autry) for a sobering dose of reality. Its no where near as fancy or wordy, but it is a lot more connected to reality.  [[ASIN:0132180235 Death by China: Confronting the Dragon - A Global Call to Action]]    After that try Paul Midler's \\"Poorly Made in China\\" to better understand the details of how we are being cheated and sometimes poisoned.   [[ASIN:0470928077 Poorly Made in China: An Insider's Account of the China Production Game]]    Finally, Baiqiao Tang and Damon DiMarco's \\"My Two China's\\" will wake you up if you've been under the spell that China dictators are benevolent.

0061784788|5.0|A compelling read right up there with his best Sigma Force novels.  In a genre plagued by dreary and pedantic dribble, The Devil Colony stands out with it's globe trotting suspense driven plot.  Rollins is the master of combining character intrigue with fact based historical fiction to intrigue readers.
0061148512|4.0|I definately connected with the main character in The Bell Jar.  Can't remember her name, isn't that terrible?  I think her character was undiagnosed bipolar. I've felt the same kind of pain in my life as hers, although I've never attempted to commit suicide.  The most interesting parts of the story is when she's experimenting with different ways of killing herself.  The style of writing for Sylvia Plath is very artful and descriptive.  There were some slow parts in the novel and some of it was labourious to get through but overall it's an interesting story.
0553801473|5.0|A Dance with Dragons is filled with dread. As stakes are raised again and again. I feel like tension was building throughout the book. Taken as a whole with FFC this novel works wonderfully. These two books have set the stage for the endgame. All the pieces are moving into place and some new wildcards are thrown into the mix. Can't wait for the next one.
0439023491|3.0|We start pretty much exactly where \\"The Hunger Games\\" left off, but you...you knew that was going to happen didn't you?!<br /><br />If you were paying attention in the first book (and please do read the first before you read this one) you know exactly how this one goes and how it will get there.  If you are really sharp you might even see the major plot twist before it hits.<br /><br />The pacing is decent though not as good as the first.  This is held back by an over-retelling of the events preceding those depicted in this book.<br />I really hate it when an author goes out of his/her way to indoctrinate new readers and feels the need to give all the details from book number one.  I get a recap to introduce, but when going overboard it is disrespectful to your fan base and the new reader has the option of going back and reading the first.<br /><br />So, we have some new alliances, new betrayals, and new chaos with which our protagonists must contend.<br />The bureaucracy plays a much larger role in this installment and the assumption is that this will grow larger come \\"Mockingjay.\\"<br /><br />Even with all I said prior , I still enjoyed the pacing and it was a very quick read.<br />Again, it is in the telling and I enjoyed 'the telling.\\"<br /><br />I wrote this next piece for the end of my review of \\"The Hunger Games\\" and it still applies here so:<br /><br />I am writing this as I am in the midst of reading the third installment of the trilogy, \\"Mockingjay\\" and I will tell the reader this-DO NOT read this book unless you plan on reading them all or you will be left wanting. I do not think I am spoiling by saying this.<br />The ending is only a segue and any astute reader will be able to pick up on where it is all going by the time you are about 25% done with this novel.<br /><br />Do not look for journalistic mastery.<br />Do not look for incredibly well-developed characters or vivid imagery.<br />If you are looking for a thrill ride this book will slake your thirst, but only if you are willing to keep reading through the first on into the second (\\"Catching Fire\\") and hopefully there will be a satisfying ending in the Third (\\"Mockingjay\\").<br />I do not like being set up by an author that way, but if she delivers...I will be more than pleased.<br />Namaste~t, but only if you are willing to keep reading through the first on into the second (\\"Catching Fire\\") and hopefully there will be a satisfying ending in the Third (\\"Mockingjay\\").<br />I do not like being set up by an author that way, but if she delivers...I will be more than pleased.<br />Namaste~

My kids, who are 4 1/2 and 6 years old, are even bigger fans of Nanny McPhee now that they have seen this movie.  Emma Thompson is wonderful as usual. I would definitely recommend this movie.  A must have for your movie collection.
B004WKOCP8|3.0|If you heard the song \\"Talk Shows On Mute\\" then you've heard this entire album. While I'm a huge Incubus fan and have been since High School, I just can't help but feel alittle underwhelmed with this release. For the record, I have always been in favor of Incubus changing there sound each album, it's what musically keeps them fresh and keeps the fans guessing, I still remember with great anticipation the release of \\"morning view\\" \\"a crow left of the murder\\" and \\"light grenades\\" and with each of those releases I always felt initially indifferent to what I was hearing, but each album grew on me over time and they turned out to be real gems for our generation of music.     I don't know if the same could be said for this album.    This album is really, REALLY slow, the only \\"banger\\" on this album might be \\"Switchblade\\" & \\"Adolescents\\", and even that is pretty mellow considering what Incubus is capable of. The lyrics on the album are interesting, but the silly tongue-in-cheek lyrics that Mr. Boyd use to write in the past has been replaced with one love-ballad after another (yawn). Even the political antic song \\"Thieves\\" while having a good message, just seems bland and boring. I found myself thinking \\"thats it?\\" after each song in this album. Some songs show alot of promise, like \\"Switchblade\\", I initially felt excited when I heard the tempo of the song, it had potential to be a real uplift-er, but then the song ends and your left feeling empty. Where is the magic? \\"In The Company of Wolves\\" which is an obvious Pink Floyd influence, is a saving grace on this album, the build up, bridge and the climatic ending is a good example of what this band is capable of, the same is almost said for \\"The Original\\" but not as climatic. \\"Promises, Promises\\" \\"Isadore\\" \\"Defiance\\" \\"If Not Now When\\" \\"Friends and Lovers\\" \\"Tomorrows Food\\" all literally sound the same and are easily forgettable, I had a hard time telling them apart, although now I can since I've listen to this album over 100times - and while none of the song are necessary \\"bad\\" they are just underwhelming and boring, granted you expect a few songs like this on each album, but to have half your album sound like this? It's just overkill.    \\"If Not Now When?\\" probably won't be a stand out in the Incubus catalog, it certainly doesn't dethrone Make Yourself or even SCIENCE, and doesn't capture any excitement that was brought with \\"A crow left...\\" and \\"light grenades\\" a five year in the making album like this certainly is an underachievement for Incubus. While I still remain a fan, and this album does satisfy my fix for alittle while, I'm already looking forward to there next album and ready to move on past this release.

I'm so upset about the whole situation I think I will stop purchasing from Amazon all together. Amazon has just lost a customer.
0545259088|3.0|Wow! \\"Forever\\" was definitely not what I expected. This novel felt very disjointed, a giant leap away from the previous two novels in The Wolves of Mercy Falls series. I am overwhelmingly disappointed in this final book to wrap the series and I wanted to love it. I really, really wanted to love it. I eagerly awaited it's release, bought it the day it came out, and stole minutes of my day to fit in the reading.<br /> \\"Forever\\" begins with Grace-a wolf, Sam-no longer a wolf, and the fight to avoid their inevitable extermination in Mercy Falls. The book started off interestingly enough, for a few chapters, and then quickly fell into a series of boring interactions between characters. A lot of time was spent in mundane and trivial scenes, time that could have been devoted to expounding on the scenes that were so rushed through.<br /> My biggest problem with \\"Linger\\" was Grace's relationship with her parents and how synthetic all of their interactions felt. This was a major problem for me in \\"Forever\\" also. More time could have been taken to construct a solid and emotional connection, whether good or bad, with Grace's parents then was. And Beck, I felt like Beck deserved so much more than was given to him in this book.<br /> Don't even get me started on all the ridiculous characters that stumble into the knowledge of wolves. For years their existence has been a secret and suddenly they blow the lid off hard and begin exposing themselves. Nuh, uh, I didn't believe it. I had trouble identifying with Isabelle also. She's just too cold and self proclaimed \\"bitchy\\" to ever begin to really care about.<br /> A solid character that I was drawn to was Cole. I think Cole's character was sweet, lovable, and endearing. So much work was put into really developing Cole and I saw a lot of growth from him, but unfortunately he is a stand alone character in this category.<br /> There was also a lot of missed opportunities for incredible suspense and action and none of it was really taken advantage of. It feels as if this story ended because it had too and not because it resolved itself. It left me feeling empty and wanting more, knowing that this was indeed the disappointing end to the story after all.<br /> As far as plot goes, at it's best points it's stable but for most of the story it is just weak. Oh why, Oh why Maggie did you have to end this novel this way? It just felt flat to me and I wanted so badly to love it, I wanted to feel the same raw emotions I did with the first two. I wanted tear stained pages and sweet romantic scenes that made me fall in love with the characters all over again.<br /> After I read \\"Shiver\\", I was reluctant to read it's sequel because to me it didn't need one, it was a solid stand alone novel. However, once I read \\"Linger\\" and quickly fell in love with it, I was taken aback and regretted ever wishing Stiefvater had ended the wolves stories there. Now, however, with the edition of this last novel I do with Stiefvater had stopped at the first, (sigh).<br /> If your a fan of the series I know you won't be able to resist picking it up, but do so warily and expect to be frustrated. I wish I had known that. Always the pessimist, I prefer to be pleasantly surprised than disappointed.. It feels as if this story ended because it had too and not because it resolved itself.

0316098329|3.0|I am not sure why SO many people love this novel. Is it because the topic and the experience of being imprisoned is so sensitive OR because the whole experience is narrated from the view of a 5 yr old kid ? But as a novel I did not find it so impressive. There are so many things which feel left out and don't build the kind of tension that such an experience should. Ma and Jack are locked in a 11 X 11 room which is in a way compared to a womb but even if a womb is a cosy place, it cannot last forever. Cats and dogs want to go outside, how can a kid be confined to one room without it being even the slightest torture.     I can understand the rescue, which although far fetched seemed necessary to the whole plot since I believe the author wanted to show what it was like being inside and then outside. But Ma and Jack seem to adjust so quickly, it's like they were locked only for a few days. Within a few weeks they are normal enough for Ma to give an interview. The suicide is just a side-track with no leading upto the suicide. The breast feeding issue seems to be a representative of how close Ma and Jack were to a point of extreme but that also is just mentioned multiple times in the book, nowhere does it become significant enough for Ma to justify/defend/clarify or whatever.     All in all the trauma of the \\"room\\" experience could have been made more effective but it is not. It just becomes one more book that you have heard a lot about and HAVE to finish before keeping it down. Thankfully I got my copy from the library so I am adding the third star :). Had I spent money on it then probably I would have subtracted one.

1451629184|5.0|He took everything from her except her ability to love which seemed to grow stronger and stronger in the crucible of her captivity.      The things that happened to her were so horrible, and she was so admirably honest about everything that I almost put the book down, but I figured what kind of wimp would I be if I couldn't even read about the things she actually experienced?    As horrible as the descriptions of what happened are, they were necessary as were her pages from her journal.  Jaycee chose to love even if the only thing worthy of her love, in that abysmal environment, was her feline friends until she had her children to love.      One cannot read this book without being impressed with Jaycee Dugard.  She does not come across as a victim at all, and rather than feel sorry for her, I found myself admiring her and respecting her.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|After the highly successful 35th Anniversary tour petered out in the summer of 2004, Yes went on the longest hiatus in their history.  Mostly this was due to several physical ailments that Jon Anderson endured as well as his resistance to continue with the traditional recording/touring process that Yes had done consistently from 1997 forwards.  In 2008 a summer tour was set to take place with Anderson, White, Squire, Howe and Rick Wakeman's son Oliver on keys, but was cancelled due to another bout of serious health problems for Jon Anderson.  However, this time, Squire, Howe, and White were not keen on waiting any longer to get out there and tour Yes songs, so they hired Benoit David from a Yes tribute band after being impressed with his performance on a YouTube clip.  They toured initially as \\"Howe, Squire, and White of Yes,\\" before then touring as Yes and referring to Benoit David as an \\"understudy,\\" and then eventually stating \\"This is now Yes\\" with David replacing Anderson outright.  After a couple of years of touring together, they decided to make an album.  Trevor Horn then came into the picture, along eventually with Geoff Downes replacing Oliver Wakeman, and we are now back to essentially the 1980 line-up of Yes with Benoit David on vocals instead of Horn.    The first 15 or so minutes of [[ASIN:B004Y1USV2 Fly From Here]] (Overture, Fly From Here, Sad Night At The Airfield) are just as strong a beginning to a Yes album as you can hope for in 2011.  It's not [[ASIN:B00007LTI9 Close to the Edge]] or [[ASIN:B00007LTIB Relayer]], but it is very melodic and well performed music, satisfying and interesting in nearly way.  The production and sound quality is also excellent.  \\"Madman at the Screens\\" is also good, with the \\"Sailor...Sailor beware\\" part echoing \\"Machine...Machine Messiah\\" from [[ASIN:B000002J23 Drama]].  As you will tell quickly from the writing credits, the bulk of the material on the album was written by Trevor Horn & Geoff Downes years ago when they were in The Buggles and in the midst of joining Yes for [[ASIN:B000002J23 Drama]].  The \\"suite\\" works pretty well...I think the transitions between the different parts could've been handled a little more creatively, but each part has its strengths and taken as a whole - it's a very good start to the album, with \\"Fly From Here\\" (Part One) being the stand-out and one of the stronger tracks from Yes in the last 20 years.    From there, things get a little bit spotty.  \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\\" is a Chris Squire tune that he was working on for a solo album; he sings lead on it and it's very reminiscent of Conspiracy's first album [[ASIN:B00004RI7V Conspiracy]]-- so much so, that I kept anticipating Billy Sherwood coming in with some lush, swamped in reverb backing vocals!  This is a frustrating song in that the first three and a half minutes are pretty basic in composition and unmemorable in melody, but the last minute and a half is very, very good - they should've started the song out with this part as it contains a very tasty bass line and catchy hook (\\"eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah\\"), and then segued into the `song,' eventually coming back to this part.  Would've made it a little bit more interesting.  The potential in this song was not reached.  But, at least it's solid.  The same cannot be said of \\"Life on a Film Set\\" which actually had me really excited as the first couple of minutes are excellent - setting up a really cool vibe and mood.  It sounds a lot more like Asia or The Buggles than Yes (it's a Horn/Downes composition from the early 80s), but regardless, it's pretty engaging.  However, for reasons I don't think I will ever understand, the song totally changes into a herky jerky, silly song that sounds like a [[ASIN:B00009Z574 Tormato]] or Drama outtake that would've never made it on to those albums.  Why they didn't just stick with the mood and vibe of the first two minutes is beyond me.  I do realize this song is based on the Buggles outtake \\"Riding a Tide\\" which has more or less the same arrangement, but when re-doing it for this album, they should've tossed out the second half.  Seems to me this is another example of Yes not being committed to just sticking with a solid idea because they feel they need to \\"shake things up\\" in an effort to come across as \\"proggy.\\"  Shake things up if you have strong material and it makes sense in the context of the rest of the song, but the abrupt switch in tone and music during this song is extremely frustrating considering how silly it sounds.  These few minutes are among the most annoying in Yes' entire catalog.  \\"Hour of Need\\" and \\"Solitaire\\" are nice Steve Howe showcases, with him singing co-lead on the former and knocking out another solid acoustic guitar showcase in the latter.  Props to Oliver Wakeman as well for his keyboard solo on \\"Hour of Need\\" which maybe more than anything else on the album harkens back to Yes' glory days in feel.  \\"Into the Storm\\" is a nice closer, with a heavy Tormato vibe going on.      Fly From Here is better than it has any right to be.  Having seen this line-up of Yes live in 2008 and from numerous accounts from fans and videos on YouTube, Benoit David is not a strong singer.  He sounds very good on this album - but in all fairness, in the year 2011 and working with one of the most well-renowned producers in the world, it's faint praise.  Even an excellent singer would have a hard time filling the shoes of Jon Anderson, and Benoit David's performance clearly does not contain the emotional depth that Jon Anderson brings to his vocals.  But, take that as you will - there are Yes fans that criticized Jon's direction of the band on [[ASIN:B00069FKC8 Ladder]] and [[ASIN:B00005NWMK Magnification]]; Fly From Here presents Yes in much the same light that the other non-Jon Anderson album Drama did.  And while it's hard not to be cynical with much of the material on this album coming from Horn & Downes' songwriting partnership 30 years ago ([[ASIN:B0033QEUGI Adventures in Modern Recording]]), I can't deny that there is a lot to like on this album.  The question now is...where exactly does Yes fly from here?
B0045HCJT4|5.0|How to survive on a forgotten planet, and attempt to become one of the inhabitants, when your a replaced soldier.  Kurt Russell does an excellent job acting as a disciplined, regimented soldier, and the soldier is selected from birth.  Later in the movie he starts showing some emotional ties to his fellow captives.  Then Kurt must save this group of people, from invading soldiers that have replaced him and almost single handedly (kill them all).
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|When I first heard Jaycee Dugard was writing an account of her obscene and hideous experience with the Garridos (who, incidentally, recently pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty, saving the State of California the cost of a trial, but leaving our prison system to feed, clothe and shelter them for the rest of their lives) I hesitated to buy the book because I was worried it would be either an abomination of poor grammar and misused words (Jaycee only made it through the formal education system at the 5th grade level), a quickly dashed-off piece of junk, or a professionally ghostwritten book.  But as a resident of El Dorado County, CA I have followed this case since it began, and my curiosity got the better of me. I bought the Kindle version the first day it became available, and to my surprise the account is very well written considering what Jaycee has been through and her lack of advanced schooling. I read it straight through without a restroom break!  The book successfully conveys this young woman's heart, courage, and determination.      Don't miss this fascinating - if abominable - story.  WARNING: If you are sensitive about sad animal stories (as I am) you will have to skip over a few parts of this book to prevent dissolving into tears and dismay, but just do it!  Skipping those parts will not detract from your understanding of what happened.  Everyone needs to read this story.  This is a very courageous, intelligent and resourceful young woman who needs to be supported in every way; part of the proceeds from her book will go to help others who have experienced a similar situation, and to assist animals who need help.      I would love to personally meet Jaycee.  She is an absolutely wonderful human being.  DON'T MISS THIS BOOK!

0553801473|1.0|GRRM can write, no doubt. Too bad he can't avoid the cliches and the overused cliffhangers. And the endless introduction of new and uninteresting characters. And unending descriptions of what people ate. And how much they piss. Please. This man needs an editor. In the guitar playing world one describes a person who displays great virtuoso playing but manages to say nothing of substance as a \\"wanker\\", and  their recordings get called \\"wankfests\\". This book is a wankfest. Heavy on the words. Light on the substance.<br /><br />I won't be interested in reading anything else he has to write. He has been compared to Tolkein but that is silly. Tolkein's stories had a beginning, middle, and end. GRMM just keeps introducing more and more middle, resolving nothing, and no doubt laughing all the way to the bank.

193413712X|2.0|Okay. Okay. I'm duly intimidated. Pulitzer Prize. Iowa Writers Workshop. Harvard Teaching gig. Literati praise up the wazoo. So what do I know? I read Tinker in my book group. I put it down after the first sixty-seven pages. Then I picked it up again.  Gave it a second chance. Was I missing something? Behind my love of reading did a Philistine lurk?      I got to the book club meeting and discovered that everybody had problems with Tinkers. And, lest you doubt our credentials, there are librarians, academics and some other pretty damn educated folks among us.     To begin with, let me say that I don't give a damn about clocks. I understand the metaphors that go with living, dying and clocks. My mother used to sing a lullaby about a grandfathers clock that stopped working \\"when the old man died.\\"  It's been done so much the steak has burned to charcoal. And I also don't get a whole lot out of the Borealis stuff. Yes, I understand that there is a relationship between these little vignettes and the family that Harding is telling us about. I know the literary establishment can ponder and brood and wax intellectual about the profundity of it, but it doesn't work for me. So what does this prove? Only that you have to pass yourself off as better that the common reader to enjoy this book. Those who count yourself among Harding's admirers can wallow in their superiority, but to me the book was BORING.     Take out the clock and the Borealis and you've got about a hundred and twenty pages of slip-sliding between past and present tense, even within paragraphs, and ever changing points of view with first person and omniscient narration. I tried to find a pattern to this chameleon but the changing colors didn't make much sense to me. Oh yes, life's got its subjective side, alright. And we do tend to wander through it in ways that sometimes can be replicated by slipping through time and point of view. But to call that Pulitzer worthy is a stretch. Nothing new here. Nothing to see. Just move along, I say.     On top of that, and most frustrating for me, we've got ourselves some inherently unreliable narrators. George is on his deathbed, and I for one, having managed to slip out of Death's close grasp myself three times over the last five years, understand perfectly well that in those moments when life and death hang in the balance, the narrator experiencing this transformation is unreliable. I wouldn't believe my account of anything that happened to me if I delivered it in that condition. And because this is true, I don't believe Mr. Omniscient either. Harding gives me no reason to trust this narrator's account. He (And it is likely a \\"he\\" because this is a very male book. We don't even learn George's wife's name until fewer than twenty pages before the end.) gives us no reason to believe a word he says and can't hold the floor against the authors whims. That means I vote \\"not guilty\\" based upon reasonable doubt, whenever Harding tries to make a point or render a judgment.     I don't fare any better with George's father, Howard the Tinker. I'm not holding his epilepsy against him. Epileptics can be credible, but Howard is not cut from that cloth. For example, Howard apparently believes that his wife, Kathleen, is a two-faced schemer, and Mr. Omniscient doesn't dispel us of his conclusion, or delusion. But wait just a minute here. They live in a hovel, not some mansion. Howard the Tinker, can't even afford a decent horse to pull his sad inventory through the muck of rural Maine. He makes bupkis. What's Kathleen going to get out of committing him to a mental institution in secret? Is there a Mr. Right lurking who will do a Cinderella number on her? Not in this book? If she commits Howard, she gets no income, no inheritance, no palace. What's the purpose of all her scheming Howard? Can it be that a mental institution is really the right place for you after all? I dare say, your sanity is not exactly beyond question when you spend years brooding about the kids you left behind, then travel hours or days to spend five-minutes with George. Howard's not giving me strong sanity vibes.    So Tinker, for me, boils down to a bloated novella that ambitiously attempts to make statements about life and death, about family and hard-times, but never actually says anything very profound. There's no payoff and the pace is a slow Iowan death. It seems to me that whenever the author approaches anything that peaks the interest, he slams on the brakes, balls it up with a gambit of magician-like flourishes of time and point-of-view changes.  Presto, you get bored. You want to turn pages all right, but just to get through it, not because you're anxious to find out what's going to happen next.    No doubt, Harding, the teacher, knows how to use all the golf clubs in the bag, but using them when he doesn't have to makes it seem like he's just showing off for his students and the literary intelligentsia who are wont to crow over style to the sacrifice of substance. This book is not for me and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who actually likes to read for the story.     Barry S. Willdorf author of The Flight of the Sorceress

I just wanted to write a note warning readers about buying this particular edition (published by thINKing - advertised above) of the book.    Aside from the horrible graphics on the cover, inside there are numerous misspellings, typeset changes, odd paragraph indentations, and jumbled words.  The whole package comes across as lazy, as if the printer cared so little for the text, they just threw together this edition.      I would recommend any edition of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" over this one.  It is not worth your money.

This book however is a great read and show what the man Robert Neville struggles with as he deals with loneliness, loss, and the struggle to find out what he is dealing with.  This very apocalyptic thriller is a great read and it is hard to believe it was written in the 1950's.  You can tell this is a great precursor to the spike in vampire and zombie novels that are the big craze today.  This novel stands out though in comparison to them and is very interesting.
B003OF3R0S|1.0|I'm not one to write terrible reviews for music, because everyone has different tastes.  So, I'm writing this review for those of you who might relate to a fan of the metal/prog-metal bands Disturbed, pre-Black album (and even Death Magnetic) Metallica, up-until-recent Dream Theater, some Megadeth.  I bought this album because of all the positive reviews.  Unfortunately, the lyrics were sub-par in my opinion, and the music did not inspire any enthusiasm for me.  Basically, just wanted to warn those of you out there who have similar taste in music and are curious: you might want to consider looking elsewhere for new bands.

This is a world and a lifestyle that flourished before AIDs, and many of the scenes were filmed in the actual clubs such as the Ramrod, the Anvil, the Mine Shaft and the Eagle's Nest that catered to the tastes of this subculture at the time.  It was filmed in New York's Greenwich Village and the infamous meat packing district and waterfront which has since been converted into a beautiful waterside park and upscale apartment living areas.  But then was then and this is now.<br /><br />The film is raw with tension throughout as the serial killer brutally murders his victims.  When Al Pacino comes into the picture we experience it all through his eyes.  He's actually straight and we see him in various scenes with his girlfriend, played by Karen Allen.  Naturally he can't tell her about his assignment which creates tension between them.  But there is tension throughout the film in other ways too.  Men are attracted to Pacino and he must play his part of being gay.  The murderer keeps killing victims.  Paul Sorvino, cast as the detective who encourages Pacino to keep going is understanding.  But he pushes Pacino hard.  There's pressure to solve the crimes.  And there's conflict in Pacino's mind about this lifestyle.<br /><br />How it all turns out is predictable but not before there are many false leads and a depiction of how the cops intimidate and abuse possible perpetrators.<br /><br />This is a good film and Pacino once again proves his acting ability.  And it is fine history about a time and a place and a lifestyle that has indeed changed through the years.
B003Y5H54W|2.0|This movie, was all bilt up to be this big, exciting, Scary movie. But, It Didn't work. Im sick of seing Amanda Seyfried, in every popular movie. This movie, is set in th 1800's and it just Doesn't work. I Found it stupid, and it could have been much better. The tried to give it a bit of a surprising twist, at the end, but that didnt work either. I wish, they would Re-Make it, and Make it better. Very Dissapointed with this film.
B00428CPUY|5.0|This is great stuff. A two DVD set with 40 cuts of music that nobody seems to make anymore. I am 63 and like most all jams that have been made over the years. I am partial to old rock and blues. Some of my old favorites like Eric Clapton, ZZ Top, and Jeff Beck, still play with the same feeling as always. Saw a short version of \\"Crossroads\\" on PBS and immediately checked Amazon to see if it was available. As luck would have it, it was there. Checkout the artists names. If you remember and enjoyed there sound from another time, you are going to want this 2 DVD set. Well put together. Enjoy.
0553386794|5.0|I started this book much later than most and based on reviews had really high expectations that this book would be very, very good and having now finished the first book in the series, I can say that the book met most of my expectations which is a pretty rare thing. This book balances character development, political intrigue, action, mysteries, romance and drama all in equal parts. Because it's such a well rounded book, it's pretty easy to get sucked into each of their worlds and that makes for an even more riveting experience overall. Finally, it's a great first chapter in what appears to be a truly epic, grand story that I'm looking forward to reading. Other than a (very) few places where the book seemed to get a bit bogged down in characters/exposition, I'd say this a true classic of the fantasy genre, though the \\"fantasy\\" elements themselves are pretty sparse so just about anyone should be able to enjoy it.
075666733X|5.0|I was quickly impressed by this book's layout and illustrations.  The included DVD has interactive graphics and short video clips that show important chemical and biological processes at work. (How a neural impulse travels along a nerve; how white blood cells attack a germ, very cool!) As you turn pages and get a look inside and around every aspect of the human body, you will see clips of interesting facts, information, and history that will interest both children and adults.  The book is easy to read and understand, but does not \\"dumb down\\" the subject matter or avoid complex topics.  It presents the subjects at a respectable level and would be a great reference book for high school or college-level students. (and interested adults like me)  I was glad to see chapters dedicated to the limbic system, endocrine system, and brain function.  This is the first book that showed me ALL the bones of the skull.  (I had never seen the interior bones before, and didn't even know the hyoid bone existed)  Each chapter also includes information about common diseases and ailments.  I wouldn't say this is a reference book for medical students, but it's a darn good book for the rest of us.
1401310400|3.0|Not too bad. Definitely only for fans of the show though. For anyone who's a fan of Castle, this works pretty well as a tie in to the show as well as fun, quick novel that definitely fits the Castle character from the show. It's basically a little longer version of an episode of Castle and while it starts out a bit slow and awkward in places, it finds it's voice around chapter 7-8 and finishes nicely. Recommend for fans of the show, but probably not anyone else.
0307593495|5.0|I have read, or listened to, most of the Wallander books.  I thoroughly enjoyed them.  This book is no exception.  I was very intrigued by the plot, the characters and the fascinating historical aspects.  I was, however, most engrossed by Wallender and what in essence is his \\"aging process\\" and the interaction with life - which marches on relentlessly. As someone of Wallender's age, I was morbidly fascinated by his descent into eventual darkness.  I am glad, that Mankell chose to give a defined ending to Wallender - one that is unfortunately too common amongst all of us - reminds us that all of us have a human commonality, regardless of our social standing, professional career, etc.  I also think that some of the \\"loose ends\\" at the end, reflect not only the \\"espionage\\" component of the story, but I think also reflect a reality of life - not everything can be answered to one's complete satisfaction - sometimes, things are just vague and unclear (much like our minds?).  I am glad that I still have a few Wallender books to read.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|All in all, the second book in fiction-within-a-fiction told book ends up being a nice step up from the first Nikki Heat/Castle novel and a reasonably enjoyable novel on it's own merits. While this basically reads like a longer episode of Castle, it's also able to go a few places a TV show on one of the major stations can't go so it definitely differentiates itself in some important ways. Personally, when I read the Nikki Heat books I basically see the characters from the TV show in their roles in the books but with some important tweaks to the Castle/Beckett relationships which clearly come from the mind of the character of Castle on the show. As for the story itself, it's not going to blow you away and while there are a few twists, there not jaw dropping either. All in all, a great way to fill your Castle fix during the summer months and a nice improvement over Heat Wave.

B004RSCWZ2|1.0|No offense to Dereck Trucks fans, I'm one of them and have been since I heard him solo behind Junior Wells doing \\"That's Allright\\". He was only sixteen years old, but he  soared,tore it up,so wild and free. I knew right then that this boy was going places. Since then he's done some amazing work. So where did this album come from? It's soulless,monotonous,repetitive,uninspired and flat out boring.  Susan's singing style did nothing to change that. I wouldn't play it more than once, and that was almost too much. It's like he did it just to keep the old lady happy. Maybe they're just too comfortable in their Florida home studio.

B005529EI2|5.0|When the first film in the epic &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy thrilled fans and topped the box office for weeks, expectations rose even higher for the sequel, &#34;The Two Towers.&#34; Would the follow-up be as beautifully crafted as the first?<br /><br />The answer is yes -- and much more. &#34;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&#34; is not quite as beautiful and strange as the first movie, but it makes up for this by the even more epic, spellbindingly complex story. Jackson follows different groups as they make their way through Middle-Earth, encountering Anglo-Saxon-style kingdoms, talking trees and the most horrifying of nightmares.<br /><br />The fellowship has been split, and two members are dead. Now Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are pursuing a band of orcs who kidnapped Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd). But soon Merry and Pippin are rescued by an ancient treelike creature, and the others encounter an old friend -- Gandalf (Ian McKellen), reborn as the White Wizard.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are making their way towards Mordor, and soon Frodo realizes that they are being followed by Gollum (Andy Serkis), who once possessed the One Ring and still lusts after it. But Frodo begins to pity the degenerate creature, and agrees to let Gollum lead them to Mount Doom -- but Sam suspects that Gollum cannot be trusted. And<br /><br />Though billed as such, &#34;The Two Towers&#34; is not really a sequel. Instead, it's just a continuation of the story that left off at the end of &#34;Fellowship of the Ring,&#34; when Frodo and Sam went off on a journey by themselves. So now, the focus spreads past our little band of heroes to include all of Middle-Earth -- it's not all about Frodo and the hobbits anymore, but about whole kingdoms being crushed by the bad guys.<br /><br />While there are some humorous moments still (&#34;Don't talk to it! Don't encourage it!&#34; Pippin wails when a &#34;tree&#34; speaks to them), there is a darker tone to the overall story. Aragorn's quest along with his friends involves a seemingly hopeless battle against the evil wizard Saruman, which may involve the deaths of many  innocent, ill-equipped not-soldiers. To top his previous work, Jackson creates three simultaneous climaxes, including the grimy, rain-soaked battle of Helm's Deep.<br /><br />But as he tells the epic stories, Jackson doesn't neglect the smaller, more intimate stories, like Gollum's sometimes-chilling struggle between good and evil... which manifests as multiple personalities. And the final battle is capped by a magnificent, tear-jerking speech by Sam about what they are doing (&#34;Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn’t. Because they were holding on to something&#34;).<br /><br />And WETA Workshop's CGI effects don't disappoint. Not only do they manage whole armies and battles, but they brought the gruesome Gollum to life. He's probably the first convincing CGI character, to the point where you can actually forget that this Ring junkie is just a bunch of pixels.<br /><br />Elijah Wood continues his magnificent performance as Frodo Baggins, with the deep friendship, compassion and weariness that he started to show before. But his performance deepens to include some serious Ring-lust, as Frodo increasingly is worn away by the Ring's evil. And Sean Astin's Sam becomes even more determined to protect Frodo -- from soldiers, Gollum, ringwraiths -- even as Frodo slips away from him.<br /><br />But the supporting cast gets plenty of attention too. Mortensen shows Aragorn growing into a natural leader who passionately wants to save the people depending on him, and becomes enmeshed in a love triangle with Miranda Otto's strong-willed warrior-maid Eowyn. Bloom and Rhys-Davies also get to change their characters with time, becoming best buddies and competing to see who kills more orcs. And whileMcKellen isn't quite as much fun as Gandalf 2.0, he still has the wisdom and fire of his previous self -- and as his opposite, Christopher Lee gets to be disdainful and vicious.<br /><br />&#34;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&#34; is an epic done right -- it's crammed crammed with so much action, beauty and pathos that it never has time to suffer from &#34;middle chapter syndrome.&#34; An amazing continuation.revious self -- and as his opposite, Christopher Lee gets to be disdainful and vicious.  &#34;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&#34; is an epic done right -- it's crammed crammed with so much action, beauty and pathos that it never has time to suffer from &#34;middle chapter syndrome.&#34; An amazing continuation.

B002O0KUXG|5.0|I first bought a $40 USB peripheral switch from Staples, as it advertised that it worked with both PC and MAC. 2 frustrated hours later (tech support, etc.) it became apparent it did not -and back to Staples I went. The manager said, \\"oh yea, these come back all the time - they really don't work with both PC and MAC\\". GROAN.  So then I did some research and the ATEN 221A appeared well reviewed, was 1/2 the price of Staples' peripheral switch (!), and also comes with a USB / device cable, e.g. no need for that additional expense as you'll need at least one extra cable when you add this small switch to your peripheral device. With the Staples switch, it was $40 plus the cable and of course as noted, it didn't work as advertised.    I couldn't believe it - loaded up the Aten 221A and it immediately worked manually, e.g. back and forth between the PC and MAC, as long as we pushed the little button on top of the switch. The next morning I phoned into ATEN's tech support line and somebody immediately picked up. It turns out there was one simple software command to \\"check\\" on both computers, and VOILA!, now automatically, we can print from either printer, just by hitting \\"print\\" on either computer. The software / switch is reading what's coming in and prints in sequence, perfectly.    I am thrilled with this small purchase, which will help us out so much, along with its ease of installation, tech support, and that what it promises - it delivers!
0670022411|1.0|I finished this book weeks ago and am still angry enough that I was compelled to write my first ever Amazon book review.    I admit my expectations were probably too high.  The description was promising, the reviews favorable.  Brainy supernatural historical thriller sounded right up my alley.  I slogged through it, hopeful till the end that it would redeem itself.  And then it didn't.    Other reviewers have already captured the lack of action, the endless descriptions of tea drinking or toast eating or rowing or napping or putting on leggings or planning vampire dinners or doing supernatural yoga.  I could have made it through all of that with only mild irritation.  I think I could have even come to terms with the fact that the marketing campaign was a complete dupe and this book is really a sappy supernatural romance.    I think what put me over the edge was that it wasn't just a sappy supernatural romance, it was a terrible sappy supernatural romance.  We start out with intriguing characters like Diana, a strong, intelligent, accomplished alchemy expert who happens to be a witch.  We also get Matthew, a brooding, extraordinarily handsome, slightly threatening and mysterious vampire.  Then, for no apparent reason and in the space of a few days, they fall hopelessly, madly in love.  Not just soul mate love, but the kind of love where Diana completely reverses every aspect of her previously strong personality and becomes a simpering, mindless pile of goo that spends her time napping and being frightened by things and wishing that Matthew would come to her.  And Matthew goes from being a somewhat menacing super powerful vampire to being a puppy eyed mope who murmurs hacky terms of endearment like \\"ma lionesse\\" and other gag worthy bits of love froth to Diana.  Eventually Matthew lays claim to Diana and marks her as his possession and she's just fine with that, since they're in supernatural love and all.       For anyone interested in the book I recommend one of twocourses: a) read the first few chapters and let yourself get excited about the potential and then, while Diana is still wary of Matthew, put the book away and just imagine the rest of the story until you reach a thrilling and satisfying conclusion; or b) skip the first few chapters and dive in just as Diana and Matthew start mooning over each other and revel in a maudlin tale of supernatural love so overwhelming that even a complete lack of personality or backbone can't keep these two apart.
0312330537|5.0|Posted on July 11, 2011 by nobluehair  ([...])    When both your retired sister-in-law and your son's 20 something girlfriend recommend the same book, that's big. So, when I saw Shantaram  on CD at my local library, I grabbed it. Now, I wish I had a long road trip to go on so I could just listen and listen. It's a page-turner (errr cd turner). A novelized autobiography, it feels Harry Potter-epic in its introduction to the amazing, colorful and unseen world of India's slums and underbelly. As Amazon summarizes: \\"Crime and punishment, passion and loyalty, betrayal and redemption are only a few of the ingredients in Shantaram, a massive, over-the-top, mostly autobiographical novel. Shantaram is the name given Mr. Lindsay, or Linbaba, the larger-than-life hero.\\"    Also on my summer reading list is Ann Patchett`s new novel State of Wonder which takes place in an exotic South American environment. For fans of Bel Canto, this delivers another dose of compelling characters with an undertone of danger and mystery a la Conrad's Heart of Darkness. I don't know what's coming and it's making me nervous and keeping me up nights burning the midnight battery on my iPad.    Earlier this summer, I read (listened) to The Girl Who Fell from the Sky. This is NOT one of those dark Swedish thrillers but an endearing and sharply written novel of a motherless child and how she came to be so. The story is revealed in delicate layers like the falling of petals until all is revealed.    Next up on my reading list is The Paris Wife, a new novel about Hemingway`s wife during their years in Paris. Say the word Paris and I'll read anything!    What's on your reading list? I'm always looking for great new books to devour now that there are no more Harry Potter volumes to hope for!

B001GZ6QBU|1.0|I don't care what anyone says this movie was garbage. I can tell right off the back this was going to suck. The first thing i noticed was the first scene where the joker robs the bank, this one part it was so fake looking. Another thing that annoyed me was batmans voice, Why did they make his voice sound like that. The fight scenes was lame as hell the joker was lame and they did not need to put two face in this movie. They could have saved two face for a new movie. ALL the people who gave this movie 4 stars or 5 stars are just lying because they spent their money at movies ha ha or bought this garbage. Oh yea one more thing this movie was TOO DANG ON LONG matter fact i fast forwarded doing some of the movie. Overall I found the Batman that came out in 1989 and Batman Returns better than this. And by the way I not pay for this I recorded this off the I think the starz channel.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|King Kong, a classic of its genre, didn't become famous due to emotional power, an interesting story, or compelling characters. Rather, at the time, its special effects drew in the crowds. This kind of film shows that innovation in the film industry is met with critical acclaim.     Of course, compared to today's films, the special effects of the archaic King Kong seem like a joke. However, even though the monsters are obviously fake, the movie is still a gripping action film, which is pretty amazing considering it's about 80 years old. A comparison of this film to something such as, oh, I dunno, [[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]], shows how far special effects in filmmaking has come. What's more, this film paved the way for the special effects industry by creating a creature on screen (King Kong) that would be impossible to replicate in real life, and doing reasonably well at convincing the audience that the beast was real. During this time, the monster thriller type of film was a new concept.     While plot is not this film's forte, it does have some allusions and foreshadowing, making it several notches above your everyday action film. (See the Comments section below for more clarification).     Overall, I'd say that, even though its characters (excluding King Kong) are mediocre and the special effects are dated, this one classic film that rocked the film industry, and still continues to thrill audiences to this day.
0553801473|5.0|I feel like most of the bad reviews are going to be based around the pace of this novel.  A Storm of swords set a pretty high standard to live up to, almost every chapter had you sitting on the edge of your seat, and when you weren't reading it you were thinking about reading it.  In a prolonged book series it would be exhausting to have 4 1000 page novels with that kind of excitement back to back.  I think back on when I read A Game of Thrones.  It wasn't a very exciting read, but it was still an amazing book.  A clash of kings was a bit more exciting, all of that climaxed during a storm of swords.  My point being I feel as though the author purposely turned it down a bit, and is spending the time he needs on the minor events to build a really solid foundation for his coming books.  I swear people these days... no patience, want excitement all the time even if its at the cost of a great story!  If you want constant thrills put the books away and play some xbox.  Otherwise calm down! There's 3 more to go!

B004WKOCP8|5.0|Too much of a departure. I sampled all the songs and their way too slow. I was going to buy this on Amazon and then Best Buy for the bonus tracks. I think I'm just going to listen to my friends copy. It really is too slow. I'm all for experimental albums, but part of the appeal for Incubus were that they rocked out. They were very unique and this album just doesn't cut it for me. Linkin Park was even more heavy then this. I just don't feel it. UPDATE ( after listening to this album a little more it is starting to grow on me and I like it; i wish I purchased it when it was on sale; rating changed to four stars!)UPDATE #3 ( I'm now giving this five stars to off set the non sense; the album is very good, the problem is it's a major departure from what they normally put out; it doesn't deserve one star) Last Update! I bought the album and although it is very mellow, I love it! Happy I bought it!
B004WN96ME|2.0|After being soooo hyped up on this box set release, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  WELL...... after buying it I wondered one thing, WHERE is the great sound quality.  This does  not sound ANY different that the origanal release.  After hearing the new releases by Queen and  Genesis, I thought companys would really start to put some effort into the sound quality.  Not  on this one.    And the live disc?  What the *&%$!  It sounds like my kid recording a TV show on my phone and playing it back.  The quality is HORRIBLE.  MY GOD BAD!!!!!  If you shell out the one hundred  plus bucks for the deluxe, you better be willing to listen to the  hi res audio for the remastered album and concert, on your computer only as they are wav files.  So there is a was unless you have  a great sounding computer and don't mind playing it on there.    Overall, a HUGE disappointment for MEGADETH fans, and the box set is way overpriced!  They could  have released the  3 LP's could have been relased seperately as most people don't listen to lp's  anymore.  Don't waste the money ( unless you have alot to waste ), on this poorly made mess.  Hope this helped save you some money.
B003UESJIS|3.0|FILM RATING:  2.5 stars<br /><br />Let me start by saying that Another Year (2010) is not a bad movie, as you might assume from my rating. Even though I didn't connect with it, it's a well made film that will connect with certain audiences who appreciate the subtle nuances of the story. Many film critics seem to love the movie, but I'm not one of them. It was just average for me...hence the 2.5 star rating.  I just couldn't get into the story and characters emotionally as much as I wanted to. The plot felt dragged out and a bit too boring.<br /><br />Writer/Director Mike Leigh, whose probably best known for Secrets & Lies (1996), continues his small character-driven indie films with Another Year. I haven't seen Secrets & Lies yet, but I'm definitely interested to see if its better than Another Year since I've heard such good things about it. Another Year was my first Mike Leigh film, and while I wasn't impressed with it, I could appreciate the artistic and technical craft that went into producing it. The production design and cinematography supported the story perfectly. The photography didn't stand out for me, but it wasn't bad either. I tend to favor more stylistic photography in my movies, but Director of Photography Dick Pope gave the film a realistic look and feel with lots of natural lighting that made it feel like the 4 different seasons in the UK.<br /><br />The lead actors all gave good solid performances within the story and writing they had to work with. Leslie Manville is probably the best performance, but her character also began to annoy me and get on my nerves by the end. She was just so clingy and immature. So kudos to Manville if that is what she and director Mike Leigh wanted to accomplish. But it didn't make for a character I could ultimately root for and want to watch again. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen were definitely believable as an older couple in the twilight years of their marriage.<br /><br />I watched Another Year on DVD, where it looked ok. I'm sure there is a color and picture quality difference that you see on blu-ray. So if you're going to check this film out, I would watch it in the high definition format and see if that helps you appreciate the film more. I'll be curious to see what Mike Leigh cooks up next.and picture quality difference that you see on blu-ray.

B004Y1USV2|3.0|This release is really not worthy of Yes, but not for the reasons that some others have suggested.  Personally I am not all that troubled that Jon Anderson was not a part of this effort and has not been touring with Yes for the past few years.  Certainly he deserves much of the credit for Yes' creativity over the decades, but I have always favored the work of Steve Howe and Chris Squire anyway.  I know many Yes fans decried this album as a return to the Drama days.  If only that were so.  Drama was the first new Yes album I bought in the summer of 1980.  I was really into it then and it is still among my favorite Yes albums.  In my estimation \\"Machine Messiah\\" and \\"Tempus Fugit\\" stand alongside any other classic Yes material and the songs on Drama were more even and consistent than its predecessor, Tormato in which Jon Anderson was very much a creative force.  \\"Fly From Here\\" sounds very little like Drama despite Geoff Downes returning to play keyboards and Trevor Horn producing the record.  It is a collection of mostly mid tempo, generic sounding songs.  You can tell it is Yes but it sounds like a collection of castoffs, like the extra tracks you find on the Rhino reissues of Yes' classic albums.  \\"We Can Fly From Here\\" is certainly one of the stronger tracks on this recording.  It is a holdover from the Drama sessions in 1979.  Regrettably it is not as good as most of the music that was recorded during those sessions.  Five additional tracks were written around this piece to create a 20 minute multi-part suite like the ones that used to consume an entire album side back in the 1970s, but this one is not nearly as compelling as \\"Close to the Edge,\\" or Tales From Topographic Oceans, or even the three part \\"Starship Trooper.\\"  Once you get past the \\"Fly From Here\\" mini epic, there are several decent tracks.  \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\\" is the best in my opinion.  Co-written by Chris Squire, it features him on lead vocal for much of the song.  The lyrics though are a bit cheesy and the song lacks the twists and turns of a great Yes tune that takes you on a journey and offers you something new with multiple listens.  \\"Hour of Need\\" and \\"Into the Storm\\" are two of the better tracks on the album, they just don't measure up to what Yes is capable of with or without Jon Anderson.  Finally, some remarks about the vocalist Benoit David.  Many have dismissed him as a Jon Anderson wannabe; a bad joke because he sprang from a Yes tribute band.  The man has proved his gifts singing live with the band the last few years, hitting all of Anderson's trademark high notes.  Obviously his natural voice is in a lower register, but unfortunately it seems to me that his abilities have been masked by the production and the mixing of this album.  He is not really allowed to front the band.  Many of the songs feature the harmony of Benoit and Chris Squire mostly, and even when Benoit's voice does stand alone on the album it is drowned out by the instrumentation around him.  I think Trevor Horn really missed the boat here.  Let the man sing and allow him to stand or fall on his own merits but don't muffle or disguise him through harmony or a wall of instruments.  This is a collection of largely forgettable songs, none of them really bad, just nothing special.  After several listens the CD will go on the shelf where it will be mostly forgotten.

141694737X|5.0|This book is durable compared to other lift-the-flap books. The flaps are harder and sturdier. And, this is very important, because my now 8 month old son has loved this book since day 1 (or day 15 or something, whatever). When he was a newborn, he loved looking at the pictures, then is intrigued by the new pictures underneath the flaps! Now, he's learning to lift, turn and open the flaps himself! He even tries to grab the cute (yes, even the snake looks cute) animals and loves it when I make the animal noises. He has other books, but this book seems to keep his attention until the very last page. No twisting, turning and trying to get out of reading time here! Highly recommended book for hours of fun, bonding time with your child!
0618918248|5.0|This is the most thought provoking book I've read in a long time. It's good to see the other side of the debate put in an intelligent manner. Although I haven't finished reading the book in it's entirety, I have found it to be compulsive reading and it is hard to put it down.
B0057AOOZ0|4.0|Queen B is back with another mind-blowing album sure to send her fans to another dimension with her fourth album simply entitled 4.  In true R&B form, the album is laced with love songs, club bangers, and energetic anthems her true fans are sure to enjoy. She also finds a new way to prove her vocal ability by creating a fresh millennium sound on an 80's-themed project.       Each of the 12 songs has a different take on relationships and the struggles it often overcomes. Knowles is careful not to over sing as noted in the song \\"I Miss You\\" where she almost whispers to ensure that you focus on nothing but the words and the steadiness of the beat. One song certain to become hit seems like an answer to Chris Brown's \\"Deuces\\"; \\"Best Thing I Never Had,\\" produced by R&B legend Babyface, was introduced to a wide range of fans at the 2011 BET Awards via a satellite from the Glastonbury Festival in the U.K. She wins the teen crowd back in \\"Rather Die Young\\" intricately placed in the middle of the album highlighting the adrenaline powering, all-consuming entity that is love. The chorus will undoubtedly be sung by millions of young girls experiencing their first strong feelings of affection. A joyous tune was inserted toward the end of the album with \\"End of Time\\" produced by The Dream. In signature Beyoncé style, the track boasts a catchy chant proclaiming never-ending devotion. The listener is made to feel like he or she has attended a celebration for lovers as the highly infectious beat keeps a fast, but exciting beat. The final song on the album was the first released \\"Run the World (Girls).\\" While some may be quick to dismiss it as another feminist proclamation of power, others will dig deeper into the cluster of sounds and tribal overtone and find a well-orchestrated performance. The tune samples Major Lazer's \\"Pon de Floor\\" and reintroduces fans to a virtually untapped Caribbean flavor reclaiming her influence in pop history.       All in all, many fans will be pleased that Beyoncé took risks most artist would not, resulting in an enjoyable collection of captivating rhythm with international appeal.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|The plot makes little sense. The villains are weak. The Romulan ship looks cool.     This film draws as much on Babylon 5 and the Battlestar Galactica re-do than past versions of Star Trek.     It was a nice idea to have an older Spock end up in the thick of things in order to get the Kirk-Spock relationship back on track, but wouldn't it have been even more interesting had they got Shatner to do the same thing for the 'old' Kirk relative to the 'young' Spock?    The biggest weakness in this film, as the start of this review says, is the plot. It makes little sense that rogue Romulans would seek to act out revenge on Spock. The Federation was never responsible for the demise of the planet. If they found themselves accidentally going back in time, why not go back and work on the cause of the planet's destruction? Moreover, in confrontations with the young Enterprise crew, they are as goofy as John Travolta in Battlefield Earth.     For people who reject the post-mo pastiche that this film is, the last great manifestation of ST remains the last show, Star Trek Enterprise. That show was the best mounted ST series ever and, like the original show, commercially under-appreciated. Had the original series ST proved popular, the history of ST would be quite different. Had Enterprise proven popular, we never would have got this lame re-boot.
B001DJ7PMI|5.0|I first saw this movie in the mid 90s and i had no idea that someone had actually been arrested for being part of JFK`s assassination (Clay Shaw/Bertrand) until i saw this movie (Oswald was never arrested for JFK`s assassination). News on the aftermath of JFK`s assassination was very rare and censored here in Australia and that`s why many of us never knew about Shaw`s arrest until this movie came out. This film really shows how we were all lied to about the assassination. And when brave people throughout the 60s, 70s and 80s were trying to tell the people the truth about what really happened, the skeptics came in and tried to debunk those people by calling them conspiracy nuts. Skeptics still to this day try to debunk Jim Garrison. Well, here we are now in 2011 and the skeptics are now the minority in believing the official government story that Oswald acted alone and that Kennedy was not shot from the front. It took over 40 years but now today the skeptics are the nuts and not the conspiracy theorists. This film by Oliver Stone has helped bring some suppressed information about the assassination to light and that`s why it`s a great movie. Hopefully someone like Oliver Stone will  next make a mainstream movie about the lies we`ve been told about 9/11.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|The Movie   What we have here is a nice thriller about a lawyer named Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) taking a case that he will soon find out details and clues as to what he really has got himself involved in. Without giving anything away, the case he gets involved in is about a 32 year old male named Louis Roulet (played by Ryan Philippe) accused of beating up a prostitute. What Haller finds out throughout the case is clues about other cases he has took and all of this leads to frustration considering he finds out he is sort of stuck between a rock and a hard place (you will see why when you watch). The story does take time to evolve. Actually, things go quite slowly for the first 40 minutes or so and then things get going after that. There is a slow build up of suspense throughout, but for what its worth, the 2 hour run time does seem a bit longer considering how dragged out parts of the movie were. On the other hand, we have a good supporting cast around McConaughey including Ryan Philippe, Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, and even our buddy Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad makes a couple of brief appearances. I thought all the characters did a very good job in this film, however, The Lincoln Lawyer was all too predictable for the most part which made it less enjoyable than I thought it was going to be. Perhaps the end of the movie picked up too quickly and a lot of things happened at once, but overall this movie deserves a 4 rating which in my book is pretty good, but not great.     Video Quality   Depth is very strong and black levels are deep. This is a very detailed and impressive presentation for the most part. The views outside had quite a bit of depth to them. Palm trees, pavement, scenery, you name it, had high amounts of detail. The presentation was also nice and filmic. There were some scenes with some very light banding if I had one nitpick. Otherwise the video quality is pretty awesome.     Audio Quality   This is not going to be your big budget action movie with explosions, but the DTS-HD MA track got the job done. It does contain a 7.1 mix so those of you with a 7.1 setup will surely be pleased. If you are renting the disc it looks like there is only a 5.1 mix which is really stupid if you ask. Lionsgate must have pressed different copies for the rental edition. Anyways, this is primarily a dialogue driven film and it is delivered very well. The surround speakers were used quite well too at times. You could pick up a lot of little things that were going on in and around the court room from time to time. Better yet was the hip hop tunes that would play and the scenes with the motorcycles. The sound stage came alive during these scenes.
B003Y3ZTGA|1.0|I'll admit I've only listened to half the album (Tracks 1-5 &8) HORRIBLE! California Girls, may just be the WORST/most irritating song i have ever heard in my life! & Last Friday Night, gets stuck in my head like you wouldn't believe, it's like a freaking Cold Sore! Oh & I know what you are going to say, \\"But it's SSSOOOOO catchy!!!\\", Yeah well so is Herpes...
B004BSFC6Y|4.0|It seems to be well thought through product when it comes to colors and what the baby likes. Our son seems to love them, grabs them frequently and gazes at them all the time. He gets only frustrated when he can't manage to get them quite well to his hand.  For me, as mom, they're not so well thought through. They're made out of non-stretchy cotton, so they don't really fit snugly or well on the foot and they're a bit too short. I think they could be made stretchy so they would fit snug, so they would not come off the foot, and about 1 inch longer.  I don't regret the purchase though.
B004LWZW24|5.0|TOTALLY AWESOME MOVIE!!!  GREAT  TO WATCH WITH YOUR PRE-TEEN OR TEENAGE KIDS!!!  EVERYONE WILL JUMP AND BE ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT!!!  BEST SINCE THE EXORCIST!!!!
B003R4ZMNQ|3.0|Great series. Would have given it 5 stars if it was released in the proper format. I will wait for the blu ray to buy this.
B002B554TO|5.0|I am very happy with my record! It arrived on time, and everything was packaged so nicely! Brand new, just like the description said, and at a very good price!
0553386794|5.0|Well developed story, and even though there are several plot lines with multiple characters, the author organizes the story by plot line. Excellent all the way thru.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|wow.wowow... This book was awesome, based on reviews I made the decision to purchase and I was not disappointed at all. from the first chp I was interested in the story line with characters who feel real, and a story line that is believable unlike some romances this one felt like the real people in a real honest relationship.. I will def be look for more books by this author!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I've been waiting to read Jaycee Dugard's memoir ever since she announced she was going to write a book on her story. Although I was prepared for what I was going to read, I never imagined it to be as horrific as she tells it to be. The beginning of the book is the worse, and as Jaycee gets older it's a little easier to read. I only wish the best for Jaycee and her family. She deserves everything and more.
B004V6MWFU|3.0|Eddie Vedder thought he should try something different in his newest album,yes, the Ukulele.  I love the sound of this instrument, but it only works in small doses.  A full album, not so much. Most of these songs are lyrically brilliant and the version of 'Cant Keep' is great, but the entire album sounds repetitive as if you cant judge the songs because of the similar music material. This was a challenging thing for Vedder to do this album and it worked, its just not great is all.  Any Pearl Jam fan will probably grab it and maybe you'll love it, I tried hard but as I mentioned its just to repetitive. Props for Eddie for trying something new, which many bands and solo artist are scared to do these days where they fail.  Does this album fail, not at all.  Cant wait for the new album. Casual PJ listeners be warned.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Like the title says, I got a call from my mom while playing a game of PvZ and when I relaunched the game all my achievements and progress were lost. My most recent backup was almost a month old so that didn't help much. Can anyone provide a saved game file with most or all the achievements unlocked? TI backup works for restoring so just post your Titanium data file somewhere, please!    Popcap, fix this bug and give us a replacement save file and I'll give you five stars!
B004KPLVV8|5.0|I loved it. It is a very good movie. Even my 4 year old loves it. Sure the effects aren't as good a Tron: Legacy. But you have to remember that this was made before we had the special effects we have today. If it weren't for movies like this special effects would never move forward and we wouldn't have the what we have today.
1451629184|5.0|I received my copy from Amazon this morning and finished it this afternoon. First, told in a child's voice, Jaycee reveals her thoughts and dreams on the morning of her abduction and then goes on to tell the reader about all the horrible things she endured after her capture. Ms. Dugard does not spare the lurid details. I was revolted by the evil that was visited on this innocent girl for eighteen years. The book is well-written, moves along quickly, includes photos, and is very readable if you don't mind some difficult sexual scenes. I highly recommend it.
B004WKOCP8|4.0|Ok, so everyone's established this is by far Incubus's softest and slowest album to date.    Seems to me they're just playing to their strengths, which, as good as all the guys are at their individual instruments and roles within the band, is undoubtedly Brandon's vocals.  Whilst most vocalists' voices get gravelier and lower as they get older, Brandon's seems to have done the opposite.  Listen to him sing something live from one of the older albums now, as compared to how he sang the same song, say ten years ago, and his voice is far higher pitched and whinier when really pushing it.  The logical step for the band was always to move in this direction as they have always written the music around Brandon's lyrics and melodies, whereas most bands go the opposite way, writing the instrumental side of the song before later putting the vocals over the top.    Personally i've noticed when listening to Incubus over the last few years that i've tended to listen more to they're slower stuff anyway when picking out songs. ie Agoraphobia and Talk Shows on Mute from A Crow Left of... and 11am, Just a Phase from Morning View etc, so when I read that this one was going to be a \\"Slow burn\\" as it was put, it seemed to make total sense to me.  Incubus are probably the only band I can think of that I would be happy to embrace an entire album of softer material from, because they just do it better than pretty much anyone else.    When Adolescents and Promises Promises were first released I'll admit it took a couple listens for them to grow on me, but once they did, I fell in love with them and couldn't stop listening.  Given time, the rest of the album is much the same way.  Although it seems much more simplistic and beige at first compared to a lot of they're previous material, the songs reveal more and more upon repeated listens.    One thing that did surprise me about this album, from a band that has produced so much completely original music, were the blatant influences from otherartists.  I mean, In The Company of Wolves - Pink Floyd much?  Jeez! The first two and a half minutes of that track would have given Pink Floyd's lawyers a massive boner! And throughout the album there are quite a few little hooks that i'd heard before.    Nevertheless If Not Now, When? is an album i think Incubus were always due to make, and if given enough time and listens, stacks up against they're previous material.  It's not their best album, but it's worthy of its place amongst a back catalog  from a band that has been at a higher level than 99% of other bands over the last 15 years.
B00138J0KO|4.0|I caught a couple of youtube videos of \\"comfortably numb\\" and \\"shine on you crazy diamond\\" and recognized the recent anniversary of Syd's passing so I have been thinking about Water's creative talent.<br /><br />This is the first entirely Water's piece of art I have purchased and it reminds me much of \\"The Wall\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\". I have only had it for about 12 hours but I have enjoyed repeated listenings!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|loved it!    straddles that precarious line b/w adult & child material.  imaginative, hilarious...each actor's voice truly shines through.    wes anderson really knocked this story upside-down, and the end result landed right-side up.    big win.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Honestly, it doesn't get much better than this.  When watching TV/movies on my television, I can move from my room to the kitchen, grab some food, and head back without missing a single word.    I never use the macro buttons; I'm not an MMO player, so they're pretty much useless to me, even for D&D RPGs.    The sound is flawless.  It's a 9.1 speaker system planted directly on your ears with full bass.  When my roommate comes in, I don't even notice her calling my name because it easily cancels all sound.    I'm not a huge guy, but my ears are a little larger than average for my size.  All previous headsets I've owned have started some soreness in the cartilage when I wear them too long, but this headset fits around my ears and doesn't put any pressure on them.  Furthermore, it has so many fit options with adjustable length and adjustable twisting to fit the contours of your head.    It doesn't take long to charge, and really, who has the time to sit there for 10 hours?  Just plug them in when you're done using them, and they'll be ready when you return.    I've played around with the software settings a lot, and there's so much complexity Logitech has added to customize the experience that I wouldn't even know where to begin.  I'm no audio expert, so I just keep everything on the gaming settings or movie settings and adjust bass/tenor a bit when I need to.  Audio pros will love messing with the settings.
B0043URV8M|5.0|I'll try to keep this short.  I don't normally write reviews on Amazon, but I need to sing the praises of this soundtrack.    Yes, John Williams' score to the original Harry Potter was amazing, and set the bar very high (I mean, he's John friggin Williams.)  Since Williams left the franchise, Harry Potter films have gone through quite a few composers (and directors, and actors, and set designs...)  None of Williams' successors were terrible, but they never quite reached the level of quality that Williams set.  Alexandre Desplat has reached that level, and without trying to emulate John Williams.    The score to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is magical, frightening, funny, beautiful, and original; Desplat is a masterful orchestrator.  Williams original Potter theme is sprinkled into the score, but it is not at all intrusive (as it sometimes was in movies 4 through 6) and is intricately woven into Desplat's own orchestration style.  If I didn't know any better, I'd assume Desplat himself had created the theme.  Desplat has also created a beautiful 'secondary' theme, which truly rivals Williams' own.  Where Williams' main theme is magical and mysterious, Desplat's theme is contemplative and somewhat melancholy.    Now, to top it off, the audio quality is amazing.  I've never experienced audio so clean, warm, bright, dynamic, and full.  My CD came with a code to download high quality waveform audio files.  These files are HUGE (the mp3 album is 134.4 MB, and the waveform album is a whopping 782.6 MB) but the quality is like nothing I've ever dreamed.  When combined with my Bose headset, I feel like I'm sitting in front of a live orchestra.  I have now been spoiled by this quality, and I demand that all soundtracks include a redemption code for high-quality downloads!    Whether or not you are a Harry Potter fan, you will love this soundtrack.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, V for Vendetta at its core is a story about Humanity.  It is about the greed, corruption, and inhuman approach to civilization and the self-aware awakening of those whom once thought themselves too small to make a difference.    In short, the performances are almost entirely flawless, save for a few instances of dialogue that leaves something to be desired.  The production quality truly shows in fantastic environments and views of tomorrow's London.  James McTeigue paved the way for an outstanding feature with far too little recognition for what it represents.    You do not have to be an activist or part of the underground intelligencia to enjoy this film, but most certainly you will enjoy it more if you understand the message.  Through its action, its clever use of cunning dialogue, and its pro-Humanist message, practically anyone can get behind this modern day Zorro.    The film and book both serve inspirations to the \\"anarchic terrorist\\" organizations of the modern western world.  But make no mistake, the book, movie and dis-organizations inspired by the story are by no means pro-anarchy; they are pro-Human.  The message is change through crowd-sourced cooperation for the greater good, and to prevent the few from ruling the many.    Final word: #antisec
B00000F9I1|4.0|Having read Neville Shute's book, and seen the three hour miniseries (and really enjoyed both), I really wanted to see this original film version starring Virginia McKenna and Peter Finch.  The screenplay is a trimmed down version of the story, eliminating the development of Jean's relationship with her barrister, and eliminating entirely her development in Australia.<br /><br />Still, I thought the actors and director did a nice job with capturing the conditions of the forced marches, and although  tame by any modern standards, I did have a sense of the horror of Joe's capture and crucifixion for stealing a chicken (and hitting a Japanese soldier).<br /><br />If you were going to watch both of these films, I'd suggest you start with this version first, and then let the [[ASIN:6302796857 newer version]] work its magic on you later.
B004Z7AHTI|5.0|I thought I'd like the first movie more, but it turned out I had more laugh from this movie. I like it a lot more, and it was a lot funnier. Liked the story as well. Definitely glad that I've seen it.
0553801473|5.0|Reading this book is like seeing an old friend. I haven't seen you in years, but it feels like yesterday that I was apart of your life. It all comes flooding back like a great wave. True, its not perfect, but it is close. Thank your George. I missed my friends. Read it; you will love it. Martin's prose are wonderful, his descriptions lucid and his story is outstanding.
159562015X|4.0|We used this book at my company retreat, and it was very helpful in showing us how to maximize our strengths and work together.
B003SNJYSK|4.0|An excellent read.  Keeping the unfamiliar names together is really hard, but I will read anything by Jo Nesbo.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I  bought these mostly to watch movies on my Mac and for Skype.    The sound quality is surprisingly good for this type of thing and the convenience of no wires is outstanding. I can go all the way from one end of the house to the other without losing quality - very cool when you're on a chat. The only thing that annoys me a little is that every now and then I have to unplug and replug the dongle for it to register.     Comfort is excellent and the features are more also very good.    I really can't recommend these cans highly enough.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|I've purchased this for an AKG K 701 to give it a bass boost.  It did give it the bass boost I was looking for, but everything else sounded horrible.  I've tested it on 3 devices so far - on a desktop pc, a laptop, and a mobile phone and the sound was consistently garbage.  I'd give it only one star, only if it didn't sound decent with some lower end earbuds I got.
B0053YEM7U|2.0|I've held off on adding my \\"Fly From Here\\" review until I was able to say that I fully knew and understood every drop of this new Yes album. So I've given it 7 solid, serious, objective listens and the word that resonates the most is \\"disappointing\\".    Things definitely begin and end on high notes. I love the Overture. It's exciting and reveals themes that are used later on but never as well as during these first few minutes. Fly From Here Part 1 - We Can Fly has a lush melody and great momentum to it. And my favorite song on the album is probably the closing number Into The Storm, an upbeat, rhythmic number with a gorgeous and absolutely haunting middle section.     The rest of Fly From Here is either predictable, boring or just plain not very good. The song-structure and melodies are so basic and unimaginable. Steve Howe's solo pice Solitaire is decent enough but it feels out of place among this collection of songs. Same goes for Chris Squire's The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be which I might be able to justify on a solo project but certainly not in the middle of a Yes album. Life On A Film Set is ridiculously cheesy...if they sing the phrase \\"riding a tiger\\" one more time, I may be tempted to break something.  And Hour Of Need is harmless but more worthy of someone like Asia than Yes.     The centerpiece of the album is the 20+ minute Fly From Here suite which is once again, disappointing. As I said earlier, it starts off with lots of promise...I have no problem with it's first 8 minutes but it quickly turns lame and silly. While I wasn't expecting The Gates Of Delirium or The Revealing Sciences of God, something a little more challenging and intricate would have been welcomed.      I know that so many of the comments about this new chapter of Yes are centered around Jon Anderson no longer being in the band and sure, I'd rather Jon was here and am not at all happy about the way his legendary time with Yes came to an end. But I actually like Benoit David's vocalwork on Fly From Here --- he somehow makes it his own and most of what he's doing works nicely. I just don't think that Geoff Downes' keyboard style is suited for Yes music. He brings a Mannheim Steamroller kind of quality to the sound which might work in limited doses but over the course of a whole album I don't think he comes anywhere close to the many keyboard-players who passed through Yes over the years.    I was definitely expecting a lot more from this effort and am surprised at just how mediocre it is. I've heard some refer to Fly From Here as Drama, Part 2 but I loved Drama which was dynamic and original and this one doesn't come anywhere within miles of approaching that level. Two stars out of 5.
B003TU166U|4.0|I've been wearing terra fi sandals for years now.  The are comfortable, durable, and they provide great traction. I get a new pair each year before traveling through rural Mexico.  My journey always includes a very mountainous, rainy area, with slick, steep, rock-paved streets; my tevas always provide sure footing and comfort.  My only complaint about these sandals is that after a few days of wear in non-stop rain and heat, the sandals develop an incredibly putrid funk--despite the antimicrobial, odor protection supposedly built in.  I've tried various efforts to clean these up so that I can continue to wear them when I return home, but nothing works.  I wish they were more funk-resistant.
B000FA675C|2.0|I had to read it because of all the hype. I gave it two stars because it was entertaining, at least. It was a page turner and every chapter ends on a cliff hanger. But the story is formulaic and the characters are made of cardboard. It is an ok book if you want something mindless and purely entertaining, just don't expect it to \\"resonate\\" with you and stay with you.
B002ZG975Q|1.0|There is very many words to describe this movie, all of them are synonyms for the word bad.   I feel bad for the actors, because this probably pushed them down in there career. You have to wonder if the actors even tried though in some scenes... I know the writing was what made this movie bad, but the acting was throwing salt on the wound, and then squirting lemon juice on it too. All in all this might be one of the worst movies of the century.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|Adele has such a great voice!  However, I can't get into the first few songs of the CD but the last half of the CD is really good.
B004XANKVO|4.0|In a nutshell, this is one NICE backpack.  Fresh out of the box and pulling it out of the plastic, I was instantly impressed and the quality is apparent.<br /><br />The backpack is made of attractively colored durable material -aluminum hardware and water-resistant fabrics- that definitely seems like it could withstand the rigors of casual life; or cushioning someone's fall off a bike with no damage to either the person or the laptop. The inside is compartmentalized for easy access storage of computer, accessories, phone, and numerous other pockets to stuff vital items necessary to get through the day.
B004UHF51S|4.0|There is a huge gap in my collection between the first two Michael Frank albums, The Art of Tea (1975) and Sleeping Gypsy (1977), and this new release. I lost interest in the 1980s when he went with the times, and soon also lost track of this mellow, somewhat jazzy vocalist and composer. Now, with my purchase, I can see how Franks has developed or evolved. He hasn't. I do enjoy his whisper voice and sound, but the lyrics do not have the same spark as his freshman releases, though they still are witty and certainly romantic. The musical arrangements of the album are sweet and pleasant and I am happy. He, and I, like Brazilian beats, and this is a bonus. His supporting musicians are very fine. Listening to the album in the evening will help you unwind and make excellent dinner music.

B000KJTOMQ|5.0|What is the machinery of divine grace?  For the characters of Brideshead Revisited, it is a fishing line:<br /><br />\\"I caught him with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the line.\\"<br /><br />Beginning with a summertime outing in the English countryside, and ending in the darkness of World War II, BR attempts to trace the thread of grace as it leads Charles and the Brideshead family back to the heart of God.  What exactly that means the reader will have to discern himself, but the result is a mixture of both the organic and the contrived.  But what else would one expect from a divine plan?<br /><br />Evelyn Waugh writes dialogue effortlessly; the characters of Sebastian, Brideshead, Edward Ryder, Julia, Lord Marchmain, Anthony Blanche--all of them speak with an ease that in part is due to their upperclass status but moreso to the skill of Waugh.  His ear for voices is remarkable--I never read a line of dialogue that I didn't hear in my head with a distinct, vital voice.<br /><br />If I chose to complain (which I have not), my only issue would be with the topic of divine grace.  The few moments that struck me as false were a certain character's guilt-speech concerning the death of Christ, a later moment from the same character on the possibility of living outside of God's grace, and a specific scene of witnessing someone crossing himself which I will not further elaborate on, for the sake of spoilers.  At these moments the machinery of grace showed itself, and by this I mean the machinery of the plot.  It's the only time the characters seem to do unexpected and unaccountable things, and I felt the story suffered for it.  Some will call it grace, and attribute these changes of character to divine power.  I will call it Waugh.<br /><br />Finally, Waugh's prose is at times ornamental, but in my estimation, always appropriate to the task and quite beautiful to boot.  My favorite bit was Marchmain's monologue near the end, which is a gorgeous blend of prose and poetry.  The potentially challenging aspects of this novel are its religious themes and its vocabulary.  If one is familiar with British slang and idioms, this will likely pose no problem, but if you're a stranger to phrases like \\"come a cropper\\" and the like, you have been warned.  What I found difficult was the usage of architectural terminology I was unfamiliar with.  However, I am guessing Waugh uses a rather stock vocabulary of architectural terms, and I simply need to memorize them for future endeavors.  Quibbles aside, I really can't recommend this one enough.  Five stars.monologue near the end, which is a gorgeous blend of prose and poetry.

0553801473|1.0|The title says it all.  I can't believe I waited so long for this book, then was utterly disappointed.  500 pages of nothing before the plot started to move forward, new POV characters with no major purpose, entire chapters of quasi-torture porn, new characters introduced out of nowhere that just make an already twisted plot even more twisted . . . and I don't mean twisted in a good way of, \\"Wow what a neat plot twist!\\" It's more of a, \\"He's going to drag this out as long as he can\\" plot twist.  First three books are still amazing.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I see that this film has about as many 1 star ratings as it does four star ratings.  Obviously, a lot of people didn't enjoy the film.  I'm not sure why that is.  I found it very entertaining and enjoyable.<br /><br />The film does start out in a confusing way, but the opening scenes where Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) awakes on a beach, near a Japanese castle is explained later in the film.  The subsequent scenes show a small group of people who are experts at 'extraction', stealing industrial secrets from the sleeping mind, when the brain's defenses are down.  Cobb offers his services to Saito, (Ken Watanabe), but in a different vein, to train him to protect his mind from others like Cobb who are bent on stealing his secrets.<br /><br />Now, they are asked to do something that is much more difficult, perhaps even impossible; not to take an idea, but to plant one into another's mind.  This time, it's rich industrialist Maurice Fischer's son, Robert, whom is sought to take his father's company into a different direction than the one his father chose.<br /><br />It's elaborate and complex.  In order to plant an idea, the small team led by Cobb must go not just one level down, into a dream, but beyond that, perhaps even three levels down, in other words, a dream within a dream within a dream.  In order to accomplish this, a new and perhaps dangerous sedative will be tried.  The danger, of course, is that the dreamer may die from the sedative, or more ominous, he or she may continue into the deepest level of the dream state, where hours in this world translate into years in this deepest level.  Cobb has been there before, and knows the danger.<br /><br />Inception is a fun romp!  There is a ton of action, as things are happening on all three levels of the dream.  There are bad guys everywhere who are manifestations of those who are trying to prevent the supposed theft of Robert's thoughts and ideas.  And then there is the wild card no one, except Cobb, expects; his dead wife, who is still very much 'alive' in his, and everyone else's, dreams.<br /><br />A strong recommendation for Inception.  The amount of planning that must have gone on just to write the script is fantastic.  To have it all make sense is impressive.  And, of course, the special effects are outstanding; really unbelievable.  The best effects are when Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) have to defeat the bad guys in the dreams second level.  The hotel they are in is rotating, and somehow everyone appears to float around, climb walls, and walk on the ceiling.  Fantastic job to the special effects crew!<br /><br />The only disappointment was the lack of interesting extras on the DVD.  There are visual explanations of making the impossible staircase and the like, but no director's commentary.e, who is still very much 'alive' in his, and everyone else's, dreams.<br /><br />A strong recommendation for Inception.

B00006JYMW|5.0|What is the sound of one hand clapping? Don't just read that and nod - try to visualize, or audibly imagine, the sound. Koans are instructions to be practiced, not puzzles to be intellectualized, and they're meant to lead to insights about the nature of life that one could never reach by reasoned philosophy or rational thought.<br /><br />To my mind, Sigur Ros' aptly un-titled album serves something of a similar role. It is not meant to be appreciated in the same way that much of our music presents itself. All of its scarce and repeated lyrics are unintelligible, just familiar enough to make you try to draw meaning from them. But the human noises mixing with the often surreal instrumental ones evoked something in me that feels deeper than a \\"mood\\". The songs on this album proceed slowly, deliberately, but are punctuated occasionally by sudden shifts in intensity. The auditory tour evokes imagery and visceral sensations which are usually inspiring, sometimes uncomfortable, and generally very weird. Accordingly, it feels like this music pushes me, challenges me in odd and foreign ways that defy verbal explanation, ways which I have found at times disconcerting but always appreciated.<br /><br />If you have never heard Sigur Ros before, take care in how you first listen to it. Create a setting that is surreal enough and imaginative enough to give the album room to unfold its otherworldly splendor - for me, my first hearing was in an almost-dark log cabin with incense burning at three in the morning. Maybe being outside in the woods would work better for some people. My experience is that if you form strong associations with music like this the first time heard, the music will have more meaning and value to you when you hear it in other (more normal) contexts later on.<br /><br />Sigur Ros' [] album is for those who think music can draw them a little out of their comfort zone and help them learn more about themselves, or perhaps give them emotional strength they will need in daily life. I experience the music as cleansing and supportive, and I listen to it when I need to decompress from a particularly stressful week. You may use it in drastically different ways. However you use it, I think you'll admire Sigur Ros for their subtle and trippy auditory artwork.ed in daily life.

B004BLTNJI|1.0|I ordered the Coraline 3D DVD for our granddaughter who is almost 8.  She had seen the film at the cinema but not in 3D so she was very excited when I gave it to her.  We've got an actual 3D television with the proper glasses and the effects are absolutely brilliant with all the 3D DVD's we've bought from Amazon.  However, I suddenly turned from the most awesome nan ever, her words, to a not very impressive nan after all, once the 3D DVD was put on their television. (this 3D version had 4 sets of special glasses enclosed with it and could be used on an ordinary television as long as these glasses were worn).  Well, it was dreadful.  The DVD came out as virtually black and white, there was hardly any 3D - it just came in now and then and when it did it was very blurred. She was so disappointed and because we were going on holiday I had ordered it by first class post (my choice, I know), but it made it almost £18.00 which was even more disappointing.  I wouldn't have minded had the quality been first class. We all watched it to the end thinking it was just a blip and would improve, but it didn't. Huge disappointment all round. I'm actually considering sending it back to Amazon for a refund.  Their stuff is normally of a very high standard and I've never had a complaint but I feel we've really been ripped off with this one.
B004WKOCP8|4.0|So, I've never really written a review before, and I don't follow Incubus news. But I have been a good fan of Incubus for 4 years or so, really getting into them much more lately.    My guess is that Incubus is an honest band and that they put their hearts and feelings into their music. I feel that this album is a reflection of Incubus' willingness to grow as a band and as individuals and to experiment with new sounds, as other albums probably, but I think moreso with this album.     To abandon their own musical history, in order to surge into the ocean of possibilities and be willing to create whatever they feel is what I think this album is. It is a completely new sound. It is probably a very personal album for the band.     This album will definitely lose \\"fans\\" who have been more attached to certain styles of Incubus' playing. Like another reviewer said, they have never really been fans of Incubus, just fans of their sound at a certain point in time.    I'm pleased that Incubus has chosen to allow their sound to change as much as it did for this album, yet still pour their hearts and energy into the music.    For the listeners that are disappointed, too bad. When bands are real and put their personal experiences and resulting emotions and feelings into their music and their albums, their \\"fans\\" are SURE to be disappointed when the artists change as individuals and a corresponding new musical sound emerges on their albums.    They are artists. They are people. They change. If they are to stay honest artists, their sound will change as well. Like the new sound or not, they are still the same band they were before this new album. They are still Incubus. Thank God they still put themselves into this album. (At least, it seems they did.)
0345529057|5.0|This boxed set contains the first four books of the series fitted into a nifty looking open-sided box with characters from the HBO TV series on front and back.  These books are amazing, and this is probably the best way to get your hands on the majority of the series.  Filled with intriguing characters, some that you hate, some that you root for, some that you learn to grudgingly respect and some that you almost physically yell at in exasperation.  This is an emotionally charged read, full of action, twists, suspense and downright skulduggery.  Highly Recommend!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Great game, played on PC. Enjoyed having it on my phone until it lost the game save data twice. Because this game forces you to play training levels from the start and locks minigames until you complete the adventure game, this is a Major problem to anyone who has played the game through and would like to replay levels and mini-games.    If they fix this problem, the game would easily be 5 stars.

0553801473|3.0|I started reading ASOIAF novels when I first heard about the HBO series. It seemed intriguing and I thought there were only 4 novels with Feast being the last. I didn't realize how wrong I was and should have done my research. I am not a fantasy reader. I do not peruse the fantasy section of my local bookstore or even care to know the newest series. My mother tried to buy me Wheel of Time and I refused after picking up the book at my local library and putting it down after 50 pages of nothing; however, A Game of Thrones is a very different fantasy novel and I found after the 2nd Bran chapter how triumph George was at bending and breaking typical fantasy rules.<br /><br /> I read a lot of fiction both good and bad and very quickly noticed in Clash of Kings, a slowdown, of the story arc. A slowdown occurs when the author purposely hold the character back to make room for another novel or if the characters story advances too much it will give away a mystery.<br /><br />This is what has happened with Feast and Dance. I would rather call Feast a companion novel than anything else and it is probably one of the most dim novels I've ever read in my life. The only story arcs that matter Samwell, Alayne (sansa) and Arya. Everything else is cannon fodder.<br /><br />Yet, George learned. He couldn't have another Feast. Dance does move at first but then get's mired down in muck. There are points where I jumped up while reading and was like yes. This is awesome. Dance is by far a better book but it suffers the same fate of not moving enough. Also, do not give me characters in the middle that I don't care about nor really contribute to the story. Don't befuddle my mind with thousands of names that really don't matter in the end.<br />Killing a character is fine. But that wall is going to come down Mr. Martin. I am not stupid and that is one of the reasons, Snow cannot be there.  I also know that prophecy must fulfilled and if anyone did not see the end coming from the foreshadowing of the prologue then you really don't read at all.<br /><br />Yes, Dance is likable. It is fun book. It needs some help on the editing process but I don't think that is going to happen unless Winds turns out dismal sales. But stories that are great have a clear beginning, middle and end. Even if it's in a series.g of the prologue then you really don't read at all.<br /><br />Yes, Dance is likable. It is fun book.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie was very, very good from start to finish. If you love comic book adventures, then Thor has a good but different look into the life of a superhero movie. It is more of an introductory story rather than an origin since our main protaganist was born to be a super hero, not some accident-gone-wrong mutation like a lot of the others, which works for them, but not for Thor. Thor (played by Chris Hemsworth) is an Asgardian, who are beings from another dimension who are far superior in strength and power compared to people living on Earth.  The family drama between Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and his two sons, Thor and Loki(Tom Hiddleston), plays out wonderfully and is essentially the main driving plot in this movie. Thor is a proud and arrogant warrior prince who is destined to be the King of Asgard whenever his father, Odin, thinks he is worthy of that title. Soon into the movie Thor disobeys an important request from his father that ultimately jeapordizes the peaceful times on Asgard by assaulting the Asgardians ancient enemies, the Frost Giants of Jotenheim. Odin is outraged at his eldest son and quickly strips him of his \\"godly\\" powers and banishes him to Earth until a time that he learns the error of his actions. Upon Earth, Thor quickly meets a group of scientists led by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) who, through some mis-adventures, end up helping Thor to find his purpose behind his banishment. Meanwhile, back on Asgard, King Odin is falling into a coma, a rest he needs to replensh his awesome powers from time to time called the \\"Odinsleep\\" and cannot continue commanding Asgard, so Thors brother Loki assumes command in his place. But is all good with Loki? He seems to have a mysterious past, and now his motives are a little unclear as to why he wants to rule Asgard.  Back on Earth, Thor must quickly learn his lesson in humility and get back to Asgard and set the things he messed up straight.    Overall, this movie was very well acted. Director Kenneth Branaghdeserves many kudos for getting good performances from his lead actors. Many have said that Tom Hiddleston steals the show with his portrayal of the jealous brother, Loki. And he readily does! The set designs in this movie were top notch- the interiors of Odins Throne room, Heimdalls observatory and parts of the frost giants homeworld were all stage built and they looked wonderful. The small town in New Mexico for the Earth scenes was built as well, but maybe this you can tell as it kind of looks simplistic, but it was still more than serviceable for the movies sake.  And I'm kind of tired of people saying Thor and Janes \\"Romance\\" was to short to be believable. First of all, who ever said it was a full-blown romance gone full circle? I never once heard either character proclaim their love for one another. This was just Thor and Janes introduction to each other. They developed a crush for each other, and the filmmakers are waiting for the sequels to flesh it out even more. Have some patience people, this will pay off down the road.  Buy or rent this movie and enjoy a great adventure with good action, you won't be disappointed! 4.5/5  (rounded up to 5/5)

B0007TKH66|3.0|I gave this product three stars because it was quite the mixed bag.  Approximately the first half of this season's episodes definitely had sub-par writing.  They were superficial, not paced very well, and bludgeoned you over the head with that particular episode's message.  But then the series hit its stride and began turning out episodes worthy of a five-star rating.  I am quite eager to start viewing the second season as I hope the trend continues.  So, my advice is if you enjoyed any of the previous incarnations of Star Trek, to hang on through the initial episodes.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I just saw this movie and I can't say enough good thing about it.  The acting was superb and it there wasn't a minute where you weren't happy with it.

0452287022|4.0|I somehow never got around to Girl with a Pearl Earring back when it became popular, and then again when the film came out. I kept having friends whose opinions I respect speak highly of it, even after years had gone by, and I figured that it must be better than the normal best-selling fair, that is forgotten weeks after its appearance and left by the dozens to yellow on used-bookstore shelves. As it happens, it was quite a good, striking and certainly memorable.    Plot-wise, I guess not much happens. Griet, the well-grounded daughter of a tile-maker who has recently been blinded in an accident, must take work as a maid in the home of a local artist. Griet's life is consumed by the tensions and dramas of her tiny world--jealousy between staff, the clueless mistress of the house, power-struggles with the spoiled children, romance with a local boy, fear and sadness caused by poverty and the plague, etc. But, sort of like Vermeer's paintings, there are details in the midst of her life that just shine, that are simply sublime. Griet, an artist's daughter, possesses an aesthetic sense that the master of the house recognizes, and so she begins to help Vermeer to produce his masterpieces, an enviable possession that is threatened when the artist's wealthy patron begins to take interest in the girl.     The key strength of the book is in the writing itself. The novel is told in Griet's voice which reflects her keen and artistic observations. The novel is also subtle, and psychologically astute. A lot happens between the lines, as Griet begins to grow up and to learn how to look at and appreciate herself and the world around her. Certainly, it is a quiet novel, and brief. But again, the analogy of Vermeer's paintings comes to mind; even if one offers just a glimpse of a simple scene at a brief moment in time, there are many small beauties to enjoy and levels to discover. Girl with a Pearl Earring the novel is like that, a finely drawn and artistic tale.
B004UA8D1O|5.0|This is an exciting, tense movie describing a crisis and disaster suffered by cave explorers.  The dark environment of the system of caves contributes to the mood of the film.

0553801473|1.0|In the months prior to Dance's release, I had reread the entire series and pondered many theories and expectations for Dance.  I found Feast for Crows to be slow, but still rooted in the Ice and Fire series.  Most of the new characters were at least a little interesting and it fleshed out Westeros as a place.  My hopes for a fast paced, emotional read of Dance with Dragons were not fulfilled.  The book spends an incredible amount of time in places nobody cares about, with random, forgettable characters.  Martin is known for disturbing plot twists, fine, but every time I read a new work of his I can't help but feel he is an awful sadist. I am convinced he trolls message boards to find out which characters (major or minor) fans are really interested in just so he can kill or maim or villify them.  But if a character is unlikable and boring, they inexplicably become twenty times more powerful against all rational sense, and never face a single meaningful hardship.  We were all thrilled to get back the \\"holy trinity\\" of Jon, Dany, and Tyrion.  Sorry, but beside a few small parts of a few chapters, these characters plot advancements range from non-existent to ridiculous.  It has been ten (Earth) years since we received a decent amount of material about these characters, yet here they all suddenly make stupid, out of character decisions, and end up backwards of where their stories ended in Storm of Swords.<br /><br />HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?  I will tell you why.  Martin is out to build a cash empire. He has forgotten how to advance plotlines as he is too busy resting on his laurels at comic-cons and cashing HBO's checks.  He wrote three incredible Ice and Fire novels all in the span of about five years.  Then he realized he didn't know where anything is going and has taken 10 years to write two ok to bad books that havent moved anything along.  And I thought Wheel of Time got slow - good grief!  Martin probably is looking to make this a 20 book series now-too bad he has killed off everything that was interesting to begin with.<br /><br /> Spoiler-alert- Dany doesn't do much important or go anywhere!  Good grief her plotline in this is AWFUL!  Spoiler alert- Tyrion goes somewhere veerrryyy sloooowwwwlyyy but does nothing interesting!  Spoiler-alert! Jon...wait , I'm not even going into that quagmire.  Did some angry 8th grade author take over his POV's? YIKES!?  A few POVs about other characters (ie Davos, Theon, Lost Lord) capture some of the old excitement, but thats not enough....it took 6 more years for the other 900 pages of this crap!?<br /><br />I was ready to thouroughly enjoy this book, but instead feel ripped off.  All the high-praising reviews from media outlets-these people probably have no understanding of the series' beginnings, know it is popular, and just skimmed the book.  Martin needs to EARN his reputation back from the hardcore fanbase.  Too bad it will probably take ten years before we get another novel to try to redeem all of this-or is that really too bad at all the way this is going?  \\"American Tolkien\\" is an absurd moniker for Martin- Lord of the Rings had soul, hope, and courage at its heart.

This book is an excellent read.<br />2.  The pacing is great.<br />3.  The book is very visual and reads almost like a movie.  I could picture the scene switched (also con - see below)<br />4.  Suspenseful...I did not know how it would turn out and was thoroughly surprised.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  I did get confused at first when it switched between Haller and Bosch. It took me a while to get the flow of switching between character's dialogues.  Maybe it is just me being not such a great reader but it would have been nice to start right off with a notice of which person you were following.<br />2.  The ending, while good, left me hanging.  The ending wrapped up the main story, but left a secondary story line hanging.  I personally like finality in my books unless the story line is complete in the next book.

B003UESJIS|5.0|Mike Leigh's slice of life movies such as High Hopes, All or Nothing, Secrets & Lies, Career Girls and his previous movie Happy-Go-Lucky, (with astonishing performances by Sally Hawkins and Alexis Zegerman), are at the opposite end of the spectrum from Hollywood Blockbusters. They are understated and believable. Within this realm of slowly moving observation events become magnified leaving one invested in developments. After somewhat of a detour with the well-crafted Topsy-Turvy and Vera Drake, Leigh has returned to contemporary setting with his last two movies. Perhaps Another Year doesn't pack the punch of Happy-Go-Lucky, but it doesn't have to, that's not the point. Somewhat reminiscent of his 1980 Grown Ups, also featuring Lesley Manville, Another Year has more space to explore the inner workings of the characters.  Like Fassbinder, Leigh has an entourage of versatile actors to work with. Lesley Manville and Ruth Sheen are mainstays in his films and, particularly Manville; expectedly turn out first-rate performances. If you are looking for explosions or mystery don't look to Mike Leigh, but if you want to watch an atmospheric, beautifully realized drama with real dialog that will resonate long after the end credits roll, he's your man. After decades of making these compelling movies Leigh's special talents have not tarnished.
B000QQZSOQ|4.0|Deep Purple's fifteenth studio album, Purpendicular came out after Ritchie Blackmore quit the band for the last ever time.<br /><br />Steve Morse joined the band and injected some life and energy into the proceedings, the resulting album was a little more varied, fun and light hearted than the band had been in years, possibly as a reaction to Ritchie Blackmore's reportedly difficult personality, no longer reigning.<br /><br />It may be off putting to some fans, the silly song titles and lyrics, the non-Purple style music in the midst of the album. If that doesn't stop you, you'll find an enjoyable if eclectic release from a band who are finding a new lease on life, no longer restricted.<br /><br />Standout tracks include the opener `Vavoom: Ted The Mechanic,' the rocking `Somebody Stole My Guitar,' and `Rosa's Cantina.'<br /><br />If you like Deep Purple, this album is something you may consider trying. It hasn't the absolute stand out classic feel, but it is a solid record and notable for its variety and both Guitar and Keybaord performances.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|This movie takes 5 strangers and throws them together in an elevator, but one of them is Satan.  The police can see and talk to them through a security camera, but the mic on the camera is broken so they can't hear them.<br /><br />One by one the people in the elevator are killed by mysterious circumstances, and everyone suspects everyone else.  All the passengers have something in their past that damns them.  One is a thug who beats people and has a long rap sheet of offenses.  One is a gold-digging woman who marries men, divorces them and takes their money.  Another is a thief and a con artist.  One is a soldier from Afghanistan (I could be wrong on this one), who has killed people in war time but also killed the police man's (who is watching them)family in a car accident years ago and got away with it.<br /><br />The suspense is awesome, and the story really keeps you on your toes all the time.  It also preys on the fears that we all have of unexplainable evil and what we would do if we came face to face with that evil.  And what do you do when part of that evil is part of you, no matter what little lies you tell yourself to cover it up?<br /><br />It's pretty good and I do recommend it.
4893580914|2.0|Yes, this book has a completely useful approach to teaching the kanji as other reviewes have noted, so I don't need talk about that any more.    BUT this book is unforgivably *flawed* for one important reason...    THERE ARE NO ANSWERS TO THE EXERCISES! ARRRRRRRRRRHGGH!!!    Forget about self-study then. I imagine that if you're like me, you want to check all the exercises in order to make sure you are doing things correctly. With no answer key though, you have to grade yourself. But how can you grade yourself if you don't know the correct answers? You're studying to *learn* the answers! It makes no sense.    I know I can just ask one of my friends or a teacher (I live in Japan) to take a look at my work, but that defeats the purpose of self-study. I want to go at my own pace without having to wait for another person. And on top of that, even if they're Japanese, sometimes they might not know the right answers either!    I emailed the publishers, and they indeed confirmed that there are no answers available.     Sigh.
0316069485|3.0|A pretty lack-luster effort from one of crime fiction's best writers.  It's predictable, lacks suspense, and parts of it struck me as implausible.  Bosch and Haller have been interesting characters in the past but you'd never know it based on this novel.  There's nothing fresh or original here.  The role reversal for Haller feels gimmicky as does the convergence of characters from previous novels (as it has in previous novels where Connelly has done this).  The ending feels overly contrived and unlikely and came across as a weak attempt to add some excitement to the final pages but it falls short of the mark and ends up being anti-climactic.<br /><br />This isn't a terrible novel.  I kept turning the pages - it just wasn't with much enthusiasm. If you are new to Connelly, give this one a pass and read Angels Flight, The Concrete Blonde, Blood Work, or The Lincoln Lawyer instead.

0307341550|3.0|I read Dark Places recently and while it had a few flaws, I thought it was a great novel and I declared myself a fan of the author.  What I especially liked about the novel was how flawed the protagonist was and how dark and nasty the story was.  Reading the author's debut novel, Sharp Objects, I found the same elements (a flawed central character and a dark and nasty story) but I didn't care for this novel as much.<br /><br />I have often said that I appreciate flawed, even unlikeable characters in novels. I guess I have come to realize that this is true - to a point.  I liked flawed characters unless one of their flaws is that they are pathetically self destructive.  I thought the author's choice in making her a `cutter' was an interesting one.  It created an opportunity for Flynn to use a clever literary device by playing with the words the character carves into her skin but as the novel wore on, I just grew weary of watching the passive downward spiral of the main character.  I appreciate the author's brave, unconventional choices, but even so, while I found the character compelling to start with, as the novel wore on, she tested my patience and I just didn't want to read about her anymore.<br /><br />My lack of enthusiasm for the central character obviously affected my enjoyment of the novel, but it didn't help that there were other flaws as well.  I found much of the novel improbable.  I wasn't convinced that the methodology of the killer was consistent and made sense when all was revealed.  And the inevitable twists at the end were obvious and predictable.<br /><br />I'm still in Flynn's court, but I'm not sure I'm a full fledged fan yet.  I look forward to reading more from this author.  She shows tremendous promise and I remain optimistic that everything will come together in her next novel.  I have to applaud any author who has the courage to create such flawed characters.
B00006LSM3|5.0|this was a suprize cd and to hear george singing this type of music was a suprize, pleasant though, easy to listen to.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|I can't get enough of the collection. I am a huge fan of David Cook from Idol and from his first CD release. With \\"This Loud Morning\\", David Cook gives us an outstanding follow up CD with solid powerhouse vocals and lyrics. It feels like he cranked the intensity a notch, with great success. Each song is immensely soulful. It's great to see this guy grow as an artist. Highly recommended.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Ok forgot about script, story, characters - If you like anime, CGI cutscenes in VGs and straight out awesome fight scenes, look no further.  This movie combines so many genres and then breaks them down into her dance/dream sequences.  It's like a merging of The Matrix, Inception, Equilibrium, 300.  Imagine a dream within an alternate reality within a bleak reality.  If you remember nothing else just know that when you see the Wise Man on screen, its about to get crazy
B004WKOCP8|4.0|I understand the \\"so-so\\" ratings on this CD.  However, this is a perfect compliment to Incubus' body of work to date.  Not their best work but its not bad.  My suggestion is to mix it into your existing collection.  I think some tracks (especially Adolescents and Switchblade) will grow on listeners.
B004Y1USJE|4.0|Personally I've always been of the opinion that [[ASIN:B00005NWMK Magnification]] is likely the album Yes were born to make. It embodied all of the positives that the band had to offer and few if any of the negatives. Honestly I happen to think that employing a full live orchestra was the best way to go for them in the end considering their heavily arranged approch to progressive rock. Well this album,coming a little over a decade after the last finds the band back with their more traditional keyboard sound. Interestingly enough it also finds them without mainstay Jon Anderson. That's one thing you can depend on with Yes for the past 42 years-the fact they can never seem to maintain a thoroughly consistant lineup. I must say,as good a singer as this Benoit David is he just doesn't quite possess the vocal power and personality of Anderson. Or it could just be I've gotton so used to hearing Yes with him onboard. Either way there are some important pluses and minuses to be found here.<br /><br />  Honestly the five part title suite doesn't really do much for me but without getting too personal I'll just explain what it is. Very keyboard/lead guitar oriented symphonic progressive rock similar to what would be found on early 70's era Yes recordings. The most unique and musically attention grabbing portion of this suite would doubtless be \\"Bumpy Ride\\",which has that melodic scalling guitar/wah wah peddle/keyboard sound which gives it a bit of that might. The bulk of the individual songs have a greater strengh to them on their own. \\"The Man You Always Wanted To Be\\" is a bit melodically tenative for a poppier song but does the job well enough. The message oriented \\"Hour Of Need\\" and the instrumental \\"Solitaire\\" both showcase Yes's trademark folkier side and does that very well with some beautifully melodic pieces. \\"Into The Storm\\" ends the affair with a heavier straight on rockier number and that works pretty well too.<br /><br />  Overall it's an alright Yes album. Nothing truely terrible on it. Yet nothing that really stands out in a huge way. I suppose if you've been around as long and toured as extensively as Yes,your bound to continue to release more solid albums that truly ground breaking ones. And that's what this is: a solid record. One thing that's important to not,especially after seeing documentaries and reading about them that the core members of Yes but a lot of genuine musical knowledge and labor into what they do. Miles Davis once said that too many rock musicians \\"didn't know anything about music,but were popular\\". Yes manage to be one of those bands who have the advantage of being both. It's been both the source of their greatest praise and their greatest criticism. But the very fact that,even when the songs themselves tend to retreead themselves that the band still continue to maintain such a high level of musical quality really gives them a leg up in this regard.Overall it's an alright Yes album.

B000FBJHZS|4.0|After I read Angels & Demons--which I found to be excellent--I decided to read his other books, and I was pleasantly surprised that this book was quite good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading the first two books in the series, I was wondering how Suzanne Collins would top herself, well she did it superbly. I was not disappointed. I had adrenaline surges and teary moments as if I'd been transported into the action. I loved the characters and became invested in their lives. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire series and I recommend anyone who enjoys action to read the entire series. You're going to love it!

Incubous releases have always grown on me and get better with age.  Maybe that's 'cause I'm 40....holy $h1t, I hope I don't start becoming conservative like everyone tells me I will with age.

B003TXT5ZQ|4.0|Note: this review is about the formatting and presentation, not the quality of Shakespeare's writing.<br /><br />This Kindle edition of the Complete Works has excellent Kindle optimization. There are hyperlinked  tables of contents to each of the plays arranged by either name, genre of date written, and each play contains a hyperlinked table of contents to each scene, making for very easy navigation. The pages are also arranged in such a way that no matter what location you jump to, \\"flipping\\" the page will align the play so lines don't get separated between pages, if at all possible. This makes for much easier reading.<br /><br />I would have rated this 4.5 stars if I could. What brought it down from a five were that one of the plays I looked at (I've only read about half a dozen in this version so far) had bizzare line spacing, with an extra line of empty space between each line of dialogue. This was annoying, and meant twice the page flips. Also, making the scene numbers links back to each play's table of contents would have made navigation even easier.<br /><br />Overall, I highly reccomend this as a cheap and incredibly well-optimized Kindle Complete Works.
0553801473|5.0|I am currently still reading the book and only about 400 pages in. I have read some of the reviews already posted about the book. My opinion is there was a reason that everything is still hanging in the balance. As GRRM said this book is parallel to AFFC. Its what is happening at the same time so of course we would not jump ahead that much. I personally like the fact that I am getting to know all the characters more in depth. However with that being said I trully hope that it does not take another 5 years before the next book is released. Perhaps with the Game of Thrones now being aired on HBO he will need to work toward an ending of the story more quickly. I can only hope.

B000QCS8TW|3.0|This review will be a little unfair: I am on book Two now and reviewing the series in a way. BORING. BORING. BORING. I don't understand all the raves. I guess I don't like it for the same reasons other do:<br />While I don't like formulaic fantasy either, sometimes a \\"formula' exists for a reason. I don't need black & white good and evil, but I would like to LIKE certain characters. I want to root for SOMEONE. I get it- make the characters flawed, human (or not) etc., but the author will present the character in a certain way, and then have them do something completely outside the character. Cat Tully for instance- strong, supportive, brave....impetuous and stupid. I couldn't help but think- go ahead and behead the woman- when she kidnapped Tyrion. Are we to believe she'd really be that stupid because she got spotted in a inn? Ned is courageous, honor-ific and so loyal to his king- that he alters Robert's will. Huh?<br />Also George is afflicted with the Stephen King disease: toomanyuscharacterus. How many main characters can you fit in a novel? I need a chart or a Dummy Guide. I lose track of who I should be keepng track of.<br />And last but not least: enough with devoting 4 pages to a freakin' banquet/feast and every stinkin' banner and standard. After ten feasts I don't CARE if its roasted duck, quail, pig or Lannister. I don't CARE if Sir Stabs-A-lot has a bluebird on his chestplate or a ball of flaming crap. Enough already! Action, sex, carnage, whatever- all better. I appreciate the intricate details but after awhile they obscure the story.<br />Oh, and one more: I think when George thought it was getting boring he threw in a little....fantasy. Seriously- 3/4 of the first book is all medieval, lords and ladies, war and games and politicking. And then suddenly...toss in a dragon! Bring on the witch lady! There wasn't really any fantasy until the very end. Make up your mind George.<br />I am trying desperately to finish book Two, but after that I am done. The only plus is that I am using it as a sleeping tool. I'll go back and read Lord of the Rings.am using it as a sleeping tool. I'll go back and read Lord of the Rings.

B0053YEM7U|5.0|Having been a YES fan since I first heard them in 1973-74 (Fragile / CTTE / Tales) and then to witness and find something good in every incarnation of the band over the years I can honestly say that this new CD is one YES's best efforts in decades. I believe I am lucky in the sense that I am a HUGE Trevor Horn fan as well. Buggles and all....Like any YES album you will never \\"HEAR\\" it in one or even a few listens. YES music grows on you and can even just one day hit you. This album is no exception. It is so full of that YES sound. It is cohesive end to end and has the best sound production YES has had since 90125 and Talk. Every instrument is clear and dynamic and let me tell you...this CD has some of the best vocal work and layered harmonies I have heard in years. And that leads to Benoit David on vocals in place of Jon Anderson. He really carves out his own place here and doesn't sound like an Anderson clone. The only time you hear any similarity is when they are all singing in harmony and Benoit is singing those high parts... it really still sounds like YES.<br />Chris is still so amazing on bass. His sound means so much to YES too. He is amazing throughout the whole cd and sings really well too. One of my favorite songs on the cd \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\\" is sung by Chris on the first verse but when Benoit and he sing in harmony it sounds as YES as YES ever sounded. Especially at the 3:15 mark when they break in to the last section singing...( eeya eeya eeya eey a eeya).It's that classic YES sound with Steve Howe picking away around the vocals. Which leads me to say that Steve Howe is just incredible from end to end as well. Especially rocking hard on Into the Storm. Downes is just great. He blankets the whole scape and gives Steve and Chris a big bed to lye in. Alan White you may think is a bit subdued but on closer listening you find he is as solid as ever and does just what the music needs. Nothing more, nothing less...<br />I rate this as one of YES's best cd's in a very very long time. I find myself listening to it over and over again which is something I haven't done with their last 4-5 cd's so go figure. YES lives on...............t cd's in a very very long time.

1594744769|5.0|I purchased this book for my twelve year old son and \\"forced\\" him to take it with him on a road trip...a electronic-free road trip...he packed it with a heavy sigh, but the next day, I received the following message from him: \\"the book is really great!\\"  Definitely high praise from a reluctant reader....so I knew I had to read it myself.    This is one of the best books I have read in a long time...unbelievable, but true.  There was the fascinating descriptions of the locale and the unusual characters, but the best part of teh book are the old photographs interspersed throughout....how did Mr Riggs do it?  I have always been fascinated by old photos, often looking in the boxes at thrift stores and wondering who these people are and how did the pictures end up in this anonymous pile?  Who lost track of these little snippets of someone's history and life?      To repeat the sentiments of a twelve yr old:  this book is really great!

0316056863|3.0|When I read an excerpt of this in a parenting magazine, I thought the book would be about her life as a mom. Some of the book is, but it mostly follows her upbringing and career. There are several laugh out loud moments, but it was hard to enjoy them with so much profanity being used. I realize that she was just being candid, but it just seemed excessive to see so many expletives in print.
0345444051|4.0|To fully appreciate 'Childhood's End,' one has to consider it in two contexts.<br /><br />The first: the era in which it was written and the audiences who first read it ... In several respects, 'Childhood's End' is a work of fiction that transcends the five-star rating system. I can only imagine how groundbreaking the concepts, images and ideas presented in this book must have been to 1950's readers. While it's usually erroneous to assume that previous generations were less sophisticated,  this is truly one of the pioneering works of science fiction, something that, by its very nature, was novel to readers of its day. That writers and filmmakers have been shamelessly borrowing its concepts and images for 60 years is testament to the appeal and longevity of this pioneering work. The fact that many of these images and concepts are now cliche and prosaic cannot be held against the innovator Clarke himself.<br /><br />The second: the plot and themes as an enduring  literary work, regardless of era....because unless someone somehow manages to do what to this day has only been imagined--find a way to move backwards in time rather than forward--it must be judged based purely on the merits of its entertainment value and ideas.  Here, it's nearly impossible to remove the cynicism and high expectations that a 21st century reader will bring.<br /><br />There is very little hard science beyond relativity and time dilation, and much like 'Foundation,' we are never given a relate-able character with whom we can experience the entire journey . Some elements of the plot receive many, many pages, while the seminal events, those with the most profound and philosophical implications, receive far fewer pages. Much more time is spent setting up the idea of the mystery than is actually spent delving into and exploring that mystery, which is a little disappointing. It all fails somehow to come together as an organic story, and feels like the setup is so generic that nearly any twist or ending could have been attached to it. The overall premise and final reveal of 'Childhood's End' are very intriguing, and the two together are enough to overcome Clarke's shortcoming as a story-teller and weaver of mystery.  What tips the scales into the favorable and memorable categories are the deep philosophical questions that Clarke asks about humanity, religion, intent, and desire. Even if you do not agree with Clarke's views, whether stated or implied, the topics remain as pertinent today, and vital to the future of society, as they were in 1953, making this a must-read for fans of sci-fi and deep thinkers alike.ttached to it.

0812550706|5.0|I've seen this book listed at or near the top of many list of the all-time great sci-fi novels ... Whether it's deserving of #1, 10, or 50 I don't know ... what I do know is that it belongs in the conversation.<br /><br />While the story focuses around children, this is not a children's tale, nor is the target audience children. Let's be clear ... this is a very damning book about adults and the way, after a certain age, almost any behavior, with near any consequence, can be rationalized to comply with one's sense of morality. Card tackles many topics in this book--war, propaganda, bureaucracy, violence, sacrifice, and even touches on some existential elements--while keeping things moving very quickly.  While character development may be thin, there are enough ethical considerations layered into nearly every chapter that any more context setting may have been distracting, if not exhausting.<br /><br />Card asks some tough questions about the nature of human relations ... to whom does one owe more: himself or his race?  To what extent does intent play a role in guilt or innocence? Is there anything that can justify a pursuit by any means necessary?<br /><br />Where this book loses a few points are the hastiness with which the plot lines involving Ender's siblings materialize and end....and the unexplained origin of their seeming superiority.<br /><br />I am not sure that simply integrating space and aliens qualifies something as a work of science-fiction, especially when there is very little hard science or anything particularly forward-looking to mention....but it doesn't really matter, as there is enough sub-text here to make this a gem of any genre. Particularly moving to me was the final chapter. I can't quite explain why the last few pages were so powerful, but they were quite unexpected and welcome. Here, Card forgets about genre altogether, and speaks to tolerance and communion without preaching, ending on a note that undoubtedly affirms the maturity and wisdom with which this \\"children's tale\\" was written.
0553801473|5.0|This happens to be just as good as A Storm Of Swords and beats A Feast by a long mile. I'm a little upset at the negative reviews that I'm seeing and am wondering if its just that people are upset that Martin took so long to write it or that the pace needs to be faster or something along those lines. A lot of people fail to grasp that its still in the middle where things aren't lightening quick but picking up speed from the fourth book. I have to confess that I'm not completely done but am more than two thirds done and I've had to pull myself away from it so I don't finish it too fast. Anyway I highly recommend this wonderful book and can't wait till the next one comes out!
0307272702|5.0|I love this book especially because its not just another \\"hollywood-dieting or skinny-something\\" book. Thanks to the author for writing and explaining it so interesting & easy. So if you're not interested in reading more crappy books you should order this one... Science, truth and really interesting stories and backgrounds!!! #thumbs-up#
1451629184|5.0|I read the whole book in one day and I've never read any book in one day straight through. This book will hit a nerve. You think you life is hard until you read the book and your life doesn't seem so bad. Cherish everyday you have with your loved ones because life can change in an instant.
0553801473|4.0|A lot of the reviews that have been negative so far for Dance talk about how \\"the wait wasn't worth it\\".  But the thing is, for the most part these reviews only harp on the fact that \\"oh, I've waited six years for Martin to finally finish it, but there's no epic battles/resolution/revelations\\" etcetera and \\"I waited so long for THIS?  Oh man I'm done with the series\\" blah blah blah.  They don't actually talk about the story itself.  And while I'm as critical of Martin for how absurdly long he makes his loyal readers wait between installments--especially since the argument could be made that a part of that wait is spent by him not spending as much time on writing as fans think he should--this isn't the place for those arguments.  A book should be judged by its contents, not how long a reader waited for it.<br /><br />These people, while not completely unjustified in a lot of the criticisms they're raising--especially in the abundance of cliff hangers and open-ended storylines-- are missing the point of what, in my mind, makes A Song of Ice and Fire great--the characters, the unpredictable nature of where the plot's going to go, the wonderful world of Westeros and its environs, but again, most of all, the characters!  Dance is much more about character development than other books in Martin's series, especially compared to Storm of Swords, in which almost every chapter involved some great action scene, or development, or advancement of the plot in some way.<br /><br />The pace here is more like that of Clash of Kings--and much better, not just barely better than Feast, which I think most will agree is the most slow-paced novel in the series.  While it lacked epic scenes equivalent to the Battle of Blackwater, the wildlings' attack on the wall, or the Red Wedding, there's still plenty of solid content that should satiate most fans of the series, particularly the introduction of a storyline/group of characters that pretty much changes everything, and one cliffhanger fora certain character that I had to reread again, it was so exciting and unexpected.<br /><br />Again, its the characterization and not the war or overarching storyline that's the star of the show here.  The POVs are essentially divided into three groups: those in the North and around the Wall reacting to the events of Mance Rayder's failed attack on the wall and Roose Bolton's rise to Warden of the North; Dany as she attempts to establish her role as Meereen's monarch and the various suitors and others attempting to reach her and her dragons; and a smattering of returning POVs from Feast for Crows which, while not completely resolving loose ends from the previous novel, do just enough to tie up those loose ends but leave the reader intrigued as to what happens next.<br /><br />The three main POVs are easily the most slowly paced, but they also have, in my mind, some of the best character development in the series.  Jon is struggling to remain neutral in Stannis' efforts to win the north, while at the same time asserting himself as a strong commander.  Tyrion has decided to embrace the image of the evil imp everyone else had wrongly made him out to be while trying to decide what to do with his life.  And Dany makes decisions in her ruling of Meereen that may or not go against the destiny meant for her.<br /><br />I enjoyed the other POVs more than I did the main ones, but really, all of them, set the stage for what will hopefully be a brilliant next installment...whenever that may be.  The new POVs (there are four--two are brand new characters and two are former periphery characters)are more or less welcome additions to the story, especially one of the new ones. Finally, Dance easily has the best one-shot POV (meaning prologue or epilogue) of the series so far.<br /><br /> And the book isn't just nothing happening until the end as some are making it out to be--there is a HUGE revelation early on(not to mention another towards the end careless readers will miss), andone of the main POVs comes out of the gate really strong in a moment that had me cheering when I read it.<br /><br />No, it isn't perfect.  But Martin can't make every installment of the series Storm of Swords or of its same exact caliber.<br /><br /> Complaints for me include, that while cliffhangers aren't necessarily a bad thing, and some of them are excellent in this, others just left me going \\"really?  That's all we get?\\"  Martin definitely overuses his techniques of repeating phrases and describing food and fauna in a ton of detail. And while I enjoyed most of the POVs, I had a problem with two of the new ones--one only got one chapter, and the other, who was foreshadowed in the previous novel, just never became fully realized for me.<br /><br />But hey, at the end of the day, I got to be reunited with Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Bran, Davos, and other characters we haven't seen in years.  And while there may not be a slambang, epic beheading, battle, or wedding people may have wanted as a reward for their long wait, there is still plenty of developments, and plenty of foreshadowing at things to come, that should leave most fans at least somewhat happy, or at the very least talking about and debating the events of Dance.
B003H6KRIE|1.0|I loved the books & believe the movies did them justice (as far as a movie can do justice to a book, I suppose), but this package is REGION LOCKED, so people outside the civilised world cannot enjoy them. I'd rather badmouth region locking on amazon.com than switch to amazon.co.uk - one star therefore.
0738727326|5.0|This is definitely one of the most beautiful tarot decks I've ever seen. I would definitely recommend it. However, it may be a good idea to buy the set that comes with the paperback and (so I've heard) a more durable box. My only two complaints are that I've only had this for a week and only took it out of the box (and put it back in) maybe six times and the corners of the box are already dying on me. My other complaint is that the little booklet that comes with the cards doesn't fully explain most of them, probably so that you buy the book.<br /><br />The booklet does have instructions for the beginner on three spreads, which I enjoyed very much since I'd never seen any of them. Once again, there are faults with this item, but it's definitely worth the money. The cards are what really matter anyway, right?
1451629184|5.0|I, as did so many others, finished this book in one sitting. It was absolutely heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time. Jaycee has proven that people can grow up with a soul and a huge capacity for love despite horrific childhood trauma. I found myself in tears just reading some of the other reviews, as they brought back the pain his poor girl suffered, both mentally and physically. Just the little things that were done, such as repeatedly giving her pets only to take them away after she had come to love them, were so cruel that most of us could probably have not survived. God bless you, Jaycee. I know this book will help others as much as writing it has helped you. I hope your life is long and wonderful - you deserve the best.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|The goods: The story gripped me from the beginning. It was a very fast-pacing book, at neck-breaking speed.     The bads: After all, in my opinion, the plot wasn't THAT creative. The characters were not clearly described. I felt I need more to SEE each character clearly.     It was a great light read, kept me exciting, and certainly couldn't put it down, but if you asked me if it's memorable, I would have to say it was not. If you are looking for thrills and chills, then this is it.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|This album is easily one of the best of this year. It truly distinguished itself from the rest of the pop tart albums and delivers strong messages and anthemic hooks. Standouts are Heavy Metal Lover, Government Hooker, Bloody Mary, Judas, and Marry The Night, but honestly the whole damn album is good.
B004UJ6YNO|5.0|It's about damn time Jessie is getting the recognition she deserves. She could pummle just about every other pop star with her beautifully powerful acoustic voice.

B004RUH59I|3.0|Not exactly a review of the product itself (it's a review of listing problems for this item), but I don't know where else to put a note like this.<br /><br />This is just a warning that this Amazon listing is for first edition. For collectors like myself who are looking for that full number line that reads 10-1, make sure you contact the seller and get a response to confirm that the book you're about to order IS first edition.<br /><br />There are some sellers listing \\"the newest edition\\" in this listing, which very obviously is NOT first edition. They are making listings based on the title, rather than the ISBN, which will bring up an entirely different listing, that buyer be warned! Is CHEAPER for those who don't care what edition they get.

1440503257|4.0|Did you spot the Pumpkin Juice in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the movie ? Food plays a major role in Potter's world and Bucholz ties dishes to actual scenes in the books. Makes for fun watching to see if they are in the films as well.   Delighted at how good her food is and how well the recipes work. But this fun cookbook is a serious treat for all lovers of British food, too. The recipes look simple but produce delicious results. Tasty surprises include the Lemon Meringue Pie Sundae and Four Classically British Pies (two sweet, two savory). Don't let Hagrid's Rock Cakes fool you. They are light, fluffy scones you will devour. Perfect to keep Pottermania alive now that the last movie has run.
B004LWZW2E|2.0|\\"It's not the house that's haunted,\\" the ads tell us, and how right they are. It's \\"Insidious\\" that's haunted by every possessed-by-another-world melodrama ever made. Even people who seem to like this misfire confess they recognize it as a hodgepodge of \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"Poltergeist\\" with a little \\"The Shining\\" thrown in. That professional critics (granted, of the radio variety) could have found something admirable here gives you a pretty scary idea of today's critical standards. The ten-thumbed direction is by James Wan, who has sawed his way through half a dozen pieces of low-grade lumber, and his screenplay is by Leigh Wannell, the producer/writer of what is commercially called the Saw franchise. This ill-conceived plot concerns a young couple with three kids who, moving into a new house, are disturbed by all sorts of specters and strange occurrences. It gets so bad they buy another house; and how Dad manages to casually buy various houses on a teacher's salary is not explained. As it turns out, the second house is spooky too, so of course they consult an expert in the paranormal.  (Actually, these houses don't need ghost busters so much as they need a can of three-in-one: you've never heard so many squeaky doors in all your life.) It seems the couple's young son, who's supposedly in a coma, is really out among the ghoulies on \\"the other side\\" and must be rescued by his father, who has been there himself as a boy. Derivative? Well, yes, there's even a visual reference to the steak scene in \\"Poltergeist\\". Suspenseful? Not at all. Having sat through \\"Insidious\\" (I tried to watch it again to verify my impression, but I just couldn't make it), my belief is that James Wan should be sent back to film school with M Night Shyalaman.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I can identify with Jaycee Dugard in a lot of ways. I was married to a covert narcissist and felt trapped in many ways as she was for 18 years. There were alot of similarities in what happen to her, how she felt, and why she chose to endure it the way she did. I too, had to use the same skills to survive my marriage to a Narcissist.<br /><br />I applaude Jaycee. We are not abused people. We are just people they chose to abuse. They do not define us. It happened to us. Its not who we are. Kudos Jaycee. This book helped me see that I was not alone.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|I have to admit that I'm not usually a fan of political thrillers, but this one definitely races ahead of the pack. Oliver Stone (an alias) is an older man with a mysterious past. He and his three cohorts in the secretive Camel Club are dedicated to keeping our country truthful and safe. So what happens when a government official winds up not just dead but murdered only feet from where they stand? Well, they run of course...but not far...and not in a straight line.<br /><br />And that just about sums up this well-written and well-plotted novel: not in a straight line. Everything about the motivations, the actions, and the characters will continue to surprise you right to the very end. David Baldacci doesn't just bring the world to within one second of total disaster, he brings us all within a few words of total political enlightenment. Having read this amazing book, I think I might just be able to take the last few steps....<br /><br />Read this book, enjoy this book, and watch the news in a whole new way.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I remember buying this movie at a shopping center when I was 13 years old. In 1976, Star Trek was going to return to TV as a spin off called Star Trek Phase II. After Star Wars(1977) made a ton of money in box office tickets, Paramount Pictures turned the pilot for Star Trek Phase II into Star Trek The Motion Picture. They spent $35 million and hired seasoned director Robert Wise to direct the film. A malevolent entity known as \\"V'Ger\\" is destroying everything in its path on its way to Earth. The USS Enterprise has to save Earth from V'Ger. Star Trek The Motion Picture(1979) is very slow paced at times; some people call it \\"Star Trek The Motion Sickness\\" or \\"The Slow Motion Picture\\"! One movie critic claimed the film put too much of an emphasis on glossy visual effects and not enough development into the characterization. The ugly, drab Starfleet uniforms were considered a joke! Director Robert Wise claims he wanted people to stare at the sets(designed by Harold Michelson) and pay less attention to the uniforms. At a stand up show, Kevin Smith poked fun of Superman Returns(2006) and Star Trek The Motion Picture(1979) for having too many VFX shots and not enough \\"spirit\\"! People have criticized the scene where Admiral Kirk(William Shatner) spends 10 minutes staring at the new Starship Enterprise in drydock. This film should not be confused with J.J. Abrams' reboot of Star Trek(2009). As a gag, he wore a Star Trek The Motion Picture jacket on the set! It's nice to see the original cast of Star Trek reunited in a movie and the music score by Jerry Goldsmith is a classic! The main title music was recycled for Star Trek The Next Generation(1987-1994). In the 2000 \\"director's edition\\" of Star Trek The Motion Picture, Robert Wise and a team of visual effects artists fixed some pacing problems and they fixed some of the cheesy and incomplete visual effects shots. V'Ger's ship is now visible as it hovers over the Earth. The opening credits in the 1979 version appeared overa black screen. Now, they appear over a starfield. Star Trek The Motion Picture was released on the same month as Disney's The Black Hole(1979). Everyone from the actors to the crew to the visual effects artists worked night and day to get Star Trek The Motion Picture completed and it's a miracle it turned out as well as it did. December 1979 was the deadline for the movie's release. In a rare \\"Making Of\\" featurette, you can see Spock(Leonard Nimoy) in a spacesuit and the Memory Wall in V' Ger's ship. This incomplete scene was deleted from the movie and replaced with a scene where Spock mind-melds with an orb. The Special Longer VHS version and the ABC TV version from 1983 have an additional scene where Kirk gets into a spacesuit. You can tell the scene wasn't finished; there's a giant soundstage behind Kirk. Special camera tricks and lighting were used to make the cast look younger. This is the only time we get to see Uhura(Nichelle Nichols) in an afro! In the sequels, they admit they're middle aged. Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan(1982) did a better job of mixing state of the art visual effects with Star Trek's rough, comic book style look and hard science fiction. Star Trek The Motion Picture(1979) is a decent movie.

B004EPYZP8|4.0|I'm not a huge Matthew McConaughey fan, but I did like him in \\"A Time to Kill.\\" While I haven't read the original novel, my wife and I figured \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" might be a good midweek flick, and we were right.<br /><br />McConaughey is Mickey Haller, a defense attorney who seems to do most of his business from the back of an old Lincoln. He's shrewd, wily, and fits right in with those he represents from the shadier side of the streets. As far as he's concerned, he doesn't ever have to feel bad if he loses a case because he knows all his clients are essentially guilty. It seems, though, that his father once warned him about the day he would represent an innocent client. Sure enough, his father's warning proves prescient when Haller ends up being retained by an ultra-wealthy L.A. client, a young man played by Ryan Philippe. This man has been accused of assaulting a hooker in the midst of a transaction, and indeed he was discovered with her blood on his hands, but he swears his innocence.<br /><br />Haller takes the case. He makes a lot of money from it. But he also uncovers some small lies by his client. What is his client trying to protect? Does it have something to do with a rich mother who suffered abuse of her own? Soon Haller is getting pulled back into an old case and is questioning his own judgment, even while trying to make amends with his ex-wife and his young daughter.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious early on that something is not right, but the manner in which this unfolds, both in the courtroom and on the streets, makes this a fast-paced and entertaining story. It has some lessons hidden in there about justice and the flaws in the legal system, particularly apropos after the Casey Anthony trial, but it never rises to greatness. There are some sloppy moments that may have worked better in book form. For example, I kept wondering how a Maserati managed to go unnoticed in slum areas, especially when the driver was supposed to be oh, so intelligent.<br /><br />In the long run, Haller lives up to his own tarnished and questionable character by meting out justice on his own terms. He doesn't prove himself above the law, but he does show that he has a penchant for wanting the truth and wanting justice at all costs, if it means protecting the truly innocent. It leads to some interesting ethical discussions without ever taking itself too seriously in the process.s up to his own tarnished and questionable character by meting out justice on his own terms.

0756404738|2.0|Despite the two-star rating on this second book, I enjoyed the first book in this \\"trilogy.\\" However, I did not like the second book. It is terrible and incredibly self-indulgent. I do not believe the author has the wherewithal to tie it all up into a good trilogy.     In a nutshell, characters are too thin, the main character is too quick to learn/understand/innovate. All characters except Qvothe, the main character, seem to be completely disposable. It's like a universe created for just one person to excel in. Anyone else that is \\"successful\\" is either crazy, aristocratic, or evil...or they are merely a convenient extension of the main character.    The scarcity of magical knowledge or \\"arcanum\\" is completely unbelievable. Everyone not enrolled in the \\"University\\" seems to be almost comically unaware of basic \\"magical\\" principles.    In summary, this book suffers from the same malady as most anything written by Terry Brooks, or Steven King's Dark Tower series.

B004EPYZU8|4.0|THIS CONCERNS THE THEATRICAL CUT. ***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />Well, my used copy of this movie arrived. Now I have clear picture and clear sound, I find it near-impossible to dislike it. Sure, in some ways it's absurd and I'm guessing some male critics were afraid to admit they liked it because of all the skimpy clothing, but I have to admire Zack Snyder's boldness. (It's interesting that two of the three most favorable reviews were written by women. Maybe they enjoyed seeing women kill the villains without a lot of help from men and without having to be ornaments for heroes???)<br /><br />\\"SP\\" is demented, delirious, and sometimes delightful.<br /><br />When she tries to prevent her stepfather from raping her sister, a young woman accidentally kills that sister. The loathsome stepfather eventually has her committed to a mental institution where she's about to receive a lobotomy when.... she enters a dream world wherein she works in a brothel. What happens there is near-indescribable. But it gets a bit loud at times.<br /><br />I can understand all the objections to this movie. I just can't hate it. Much of it I'm really enjoying. (I'm half through it.)<br /><br />I'm not much of a fan of action movies and some of the battle scenes in this seem too long but they're so over-the-top I almost have to admire them.<br /><br />I'm curious to see if this sells a lot of DVDs and/or becomes a cult favorite.<br /><br />Here's a little oddity: I removed the paper sleeve so I could scan it for a review and I discovered there's artwork on the (usually white) INSIDE of the sleeve. Plus the art features the person who is the film's true protagonist. Snyder gives a hint or two very early about whom the story really centers, then he spends the rest of the movie throwing you curves. I wonder if that major mystery is solved more clearly in the extended version??? Did Warner Brothers insist on cuts that muddied the story and helped sink the movie at the box office? Blast! Now I want to buy the extended version!<br /><br />************************************* UPDATE: 16 Dec 2011 ***********************<br /><br />I don't have a Blu-Ray player but I saw this set for only $10 including shipping.

I also use it to listen to music and watch movies, which sound equally great.<br /><br />As for the mic portion, it is also outstanding. No crackling, muffled, choppy sound is heard from people over Skype. It is perfect and clear, and also works wonderfully for streaming.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this headset for people who don't want to spend a lot, but want superior quality!

B001AQO446|1.0|Sorry for the all-caps but it needs to be easily seen. This title will only have lossy(compressed) audio on it instead of having an uncompressed audio track. This means that the audio on this disc will be no better than simple dvd quality instead of the uncompressed clarity that blu-ray can offer. Given that this is basically a musical and the music is a huge part of the story and the movie itself, WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU RELEASE THIS ON BLU-RAY WITHOUT HD AUDIO?!?! This is completely intolerable and I recommend anyone who's ordered this to cancel their order because Universal really needs to be sent a message that this is absolutely inexcusable on such a beloved title. Would you release West Side Story with lossy audio? Would you release Sound Of Music with lossy audio? Would you release any musical whatsoever in lossy audio? No you wouldn't unless you are Universal and are run by complete and utter buffoons.

It had all the great components; characters, premise, plotline.  Definitely a good book to read.<br /><br />Tally is an Ugly eagerly looking forward to her 16th birthday when she will be able to have the surgery that makes her a pretty.  You see, new pretties get to have all the fun, and well, they aren't ugly.  There's no reason to not look forward to that time.  At least for most people.  Tally's friend Shay has decided instead to run off to a secret place where no one has the surgery.  Tally doesn't understand why Shay would want to do something like that, but when the government forces Tally to go look for her friend or not receive her surgery, she is taken to a world where things are not always what they seem.  Tally isn't sure whether spying is the right thing to do at all.<br /><br />Tally isn't wishy washy like some characters can be.  Sure she changes her opinion a bit but its done in a very believable way.  She has a lot of growth in the novel and while she has superficial tendencies, she's a good person.  Shay on the other hand I think gets all the bad luck.  I couldn't help but feel sorry for her throughout the whole novel.  It was interesting to see the comparison between the \\"uglies\\" and the \\"pretties.\\"  Something very different is there and its fascinating to read about.<br /><br />For a plot I think this one had a really good premise.  The book starts out a bit slow in the beginning but you're quickly enveloped in the storyline, and if you're like me, can't set the book down.  Westerfeld has also done a great job of incorporating new language and slang for the time his book is held in.  The little nuances make everything believable and he treats the new technology like something that's been around forever; which in the character's eyes, it has.  Since this book was written for young adults, there isn't strong language or heavy adult themes, but it is still not a book I picture a younger child being able to read just because the writing is more sophisticated.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the next book in the series.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|The plot is weird, but intriguing. I wish I had known how scary it would be before buying it! If you don't like seeing large quantities of blood, this show may not be for you.  There are also corny \\"Twilight\\" moments, but most of the romantic parts are not that over the top.  There are lots of sex scenes as well, but most are relevant to the plot.  Overall, True Blood is a show that keeps you entertained.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Played this game for the first time a few years ago, and now I can't get enough of it.  I introduced it to my family and now we play it all the time.  Games are quick and a lot of strategy is involved.  A must-have for any family game night.
0385342055|2.0|Becky Brandon (nee Bloomwood) is back in the latest Shopaholic series, where she tackles motherhood, MILs and, ahem, budgeting. Of course, anything involving Becky is sure to involve colorful characters, zany adventures and of course, shopping.    As cute as the premise sounds--Minnie is now a \\"spirited\\" two year-old and Becky plans a suprise party for Luke amidst a worldwide recession that has everyone belt-tightening--this book unfortunately falls flat. The endearing Becky in her younger single days just seems shallow and sad now that she's older and has responsibilities. The crazy stories she used to make up to strangers now make her seem like a pathological liar. What used to be silly self justifications for her erratic behavior make her look like she's in utter denial. Her inability to pass by a store without giving her Visa a major workout makes it hard to excuse her utter lack of self control. And the enabling by those around her who should supposedly know better, (Suze, Mr. and Mrs. Bloomwood and Luke, I'm looking at all of you...) makes it all the more frustrating to read.    The worst subplot for me, the mother of two young children, was that involving Minnie. Absolutely nothing is likeable about this character. Whom Becky calls \\"spirited\\" is really an out-of-control terror of a toddler to whom the word \\"no\\" is never uttered and discipline is never administered. Time after time we see Becky and Luke condone Minnie's tyrranical behavior and half-heartedly attempt to reign her in, only to give into her tantrums just to quiet her. Call me high-strung, but I didn't find the fact that she toppled a Christmas display, squirted ketchup all over someone's sweater and caused a huge scene in a store to be cute or funny. Usually there comes a point in the Shopaholic books where Becky is able to see from an outsider's perspective how far she's in over her head and works to fix the problem. Without giving away any major spoilers, something like that is attempted with Minnie's behavior, but Kinsella takes Becky only about halfway there before making up another excuse for Minnie and rushing through to continue the suprise party plot. Readers are left baffled, confused and unsatisfied.    I got about six chapters into the book before I had to start simply skimming the remainder to find out the major plot points. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head: Kinsella's Shopaholic books are definitely formulaic, but at least the plot was entertaining and ending did a nice job of tying up the loose ends. We can see Becky realize her mistakes and ultimately grow from the experience. Mini-Shopaholic gives readers none of that and in fact encourages us to rally against Becky, wondering how many times a supposed adult can make the same mistakes without learning from them. The ending leaves it wide open for another installment and I hope unlike Becky, Kinsella realizes her error and gives readers a more mature and gratifying sequel.
0002247399|3.0|Compared to whats out there I'll give this a score of 3. Compared to books 1-3... a 1.5 at the most. Its too bad because at times the story really grabbed me again and I would think to myself \\"Ok, the pieces are now in place, here we go!\\". Sadly, it turns out nothing could be further from the truth. The plot lines move ahead like a car with a bad timing belt. And in the end, I feel that while things happened, nothing has really changed.<br /><br />Plot and minor writing/editing issues aside I think this is a solid book. Unfortunately, plot tends to be a major piece of a book. I understood going in to this read, that the first 1/2 - 2/3 of the book were going to be alongside AFFC. So I expected some stuff to happen, but not too much. Just see the world through the POV of more interesting characters. But I expected the latter portions of the book to setup the next big set of conflicts in Westeros. What I got though, left me both disappointed and slightly confused.<br /><br />Certain characters are still bumbling around doing something (and I use the word something because I don't know what they are doing/thinking, and I don't think GRRM has a clue either). And the so called \\"Meereenese Knot\\"? No comment for now. The plot seemed to move very little. Sure things happened, but I couldn't (and still cant) lose the feeling that nobody ever really reached a goal or accomplished anything. In fact, most characters still seem to have the same aspirations and goals that they did at the conclusion of ASOS and AFFC. I'm thoroughly confused with the ending of one major character and at the same time totally unsatisfied/confused at the fate of another major character. All things considered, one is not missing much in this book in terms of plot substance.<br /><br />And that leads me to the subject of cliffhangers. This has been mentioned in other reviews but I think it bears repeating: Abrupt cliffhangers with little explanation as to the aftermath should not precede a 5+ yr gap inpublishing the next volume. Also, cliffhangers tend to work better when the reader can not easily predict what is going to happen on page 50 of a 1000+ page book.<br /><br />Another criticism (and this may just be a pet peeve). I understand that politicking is a major part of the story, especially for Tyrion and such because they are not \\"handy with the steel if you know what I mean\\". But sometimes the \\"connections\\" and \\"levels of deception\\" ruin the various ruses and such. At some points it feels like Tyrion is really Nicolas Cage in National Treasure. He just looks at something and 10 seconds later has made 5 separate deductions based on obscure knowledge that most Maester's don't have. And for that matter, how many \\"levels of deception\\" can there be before someone just loses their mind trying to puzzle it out and just say's: \\"ah screw it, kill him\\".<br /><br />In the end, this book certainly stands on its own 2 feet compared to other books in this genre. It just falls short of 3/4 of its predecessors.<br /><br />[ ---=== WARNING - WARNING ===--- ]<br />[ ---===  SPOILERS  AHEAD  ===--- ]<br />[ ---=== WARNING - WARNING ===--- ]<br /><br />Tyrion's plot lines went far to slow. At the conclusion of AFFC, we knew that Tyrion went east, which meant that he was going to head towards Dany. Even if he didn't know it, the move was arranged by Varys. Unfortunately he never gets there. He is still trying to get there though. It isn't like a major revelation occurred and he decided there was something more important to do. He just isn't there yet. In fact, with the ending that Dany has I'm not sure it even matters anymore. And Penny reminds me of Jar-Jar Binks ...<br /><br />Dany's storyline is totally ridiculous if you ask me. She is concerned about her new subjects well being, so instead of invading Westeros, she decides to stick around with her dragons and make Meereen a better place. And so she spends almost all her chapters fighting for her people and their freedom. But in the end, with her city under siege and \\"Ser Grandfather\\" Selmy trying to keep everything together, she decides that to move forward she needs to move back. So she goes to hang out in the Dothraki Sea again. The character transition from the wise/caring/selfless Queen to the emotionally unstable/unwise queen is never explained (at least I'm not buying it). It's so bad that I'm hoping she just gets killed because in about 3 chapters her storyline went to crap. It's a waste of pages at this point (especially with this other new kid around). I think in trying to untie the \\"knot\\", GRRM inadvertently made it worse.<br /><br />As to Jon Snow. His storyline see's the most action (he's actually doing productive things). And his story arc is quite good. His struggles are outlined quite well. The situation at the Wall is laid plain. But you always knew from the first 2 chapters how it was going to end. You were hoping it wouldn't be that way. But it was. And it is really bad. I could stay up all night writing about how I hated this move. Suffice to say, you knew it was coming, and when it finally happened you were thinking \\"dammit - this is so lame\\", and then you really don't know what to think after that because you don't get anymore information about the situation. And I don't see a way out of the situation that doesn't involve the use a really silly plot device (unless they all missed).<br /><br />Finally, Arya. She needed about 2-3 more chapters. I don't understand her relevance at this point. Just remove her from the story and bring her back if she makes a reappearance. And over the course of chapters throw in some stuff about where she has been and what she did. But she's just burning up page space at this point.
0316069884|5.0|I stumbled upon this read by chance.  Having gone \\"pescatarian\\" roughly six months ago and loving the way my mind and body have felt ever since, I thought this would be something I could delve into once in a blue moon while taking a break from whatever book I happened to be seriously reading at the time.  As it played out, I was hooked within 10 minutes and read the entire book in two evenings after my daughters were sound asleep.  I suppose I was a bit cautious in the sense that I was anticipating something I could read half-heartedly about how horrible of a person you must be if you eat meat.  If that was what I would find, I would have laughed hysterically because the people who tell you you're wrong because you do things differently than them really just irk me, plain and simple.    This book reads so incredibly well.  The writing alone was fantastic, but the content and the manner in which the content was presented was charming, full of anecdotes and a smooth language.  Not once did I feel as though Foer was accusing people who eat meat of being bad human beings.  More impressively, not once did I feel like he was taking cheap shots at factory farmers.  In a word, his approach to the subject was FAIR.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of things you'll read in this book that may make you cringe at the smell of smoke churning from your neighbors grill this weekend, but it's based off of cold hard facts.  He presents everything as it is, in fact giving family farmers and factory farmers alike an opportunity to present the story in their own words.  In doing so, Foer succeeds in giving legitimacy to his tale.  While the book reads like a memoir and is enjoyable, it's so refreshing to be able to learn more about such a heavy and important topic as this without the dull and boring fact spewing that is so common.    I don't view this book as propaganda to be used to convince somebody to become a vegetarian and to stop eating meat.  I don't view this as any sort ofa tool to persuade people that eating animals is cruel, etc.  I view this book as one man's fascinating research and discoveries about the world of meat production, and I applaud his reasons for writing the book (as I stated, father of two girls). Again, while the book gives plenty of reasons and substantial backbone to my decision to stop eating meat, there is so much more to \\"Eating Animals\\" than that.    Five stars because that's the maximum I can give it.  I will certainly read it again as I found myself constantly highlighting portions while reading it on my Kindle.
0765348276|5.0|Really wonderful book. Scalzi manages to introduce you to his universe, alien races, and lots of super-cool technology while still writing a story that is driven by *characters*.   If you're really not a fan of the military, you may not like this book as the vast majority of it takes place while the characters are in the armed forces. However you don't need to be a vet or even an admirer of the military to like this story about second chances, and learning how to stay true to yourself even though your entire world changes.  Edit 10/20/2011:  I'm now in the middle of my 2nd reading of Old Man's War and have just realized that it really is only *nominally* a sci-fi/adventure story. I don't want to give anything away to anyone who hasn't read the book yet, but the setting of humanity fighting an inter-stellar war against alien species really is truly background.
B005AUWY90|4.0|I had a very unusual experience seeing this movie in theaters.    I watched it, I had a great time, I laughed, cheered, was thrilled, and the moment the credits started to roll the people in the row behind me IMMEDIATELY started spouting off how much they HATED it. I was flabbergasted. I was sorely tempted to turn around and ask them if we even just saw the same movie? How could anyone hate something that's so much FUN?!    But after thinking about it, I could see actually why they didn't get into it. Cars 2 is the first Pixar movie where you really have to 'get the joke' of the premise, or the whole thing falls apart like a house of cards. What this movie is, is the best James Bond movie of the last 15 years (not counting Casino Royale which transcends Bond movies to be just a great spy movie), with a bit of The Accidental Spy thrown in.     I LOVE Bond movies. The crazy opening sequences, the insane gadgets, the quippy lines. And Cars 2 hit pitch perfect parodies of every Bond standard. But you could never say of any Bond movie that it's got a deep emotional core, that's not how they're made. They're made to be balls to the wall fun and thrills, and that's what this movie is. Which of course makes it the polar opposite of the original Cars. It could hardly be more different.    If you get the joke, that this is a James Bond movie with cars, it's a riot. Loads of fun. It's not deep, it's not going to tug at your heart strings, it will not make your mother cry three or four times (as virtually ever Pixar movie ever made prior has done to my mother, I take her to Pixar movies with a bucket). It's just riotous fun. And I'm amazed that people are punishing Pixar for making a movie that's just pure fun. Granted Pixar is famous for it's deep emotional stories, and I suppose people expect that sort of thing every time. Even if you make a fun and entertaining movie, if you don't do what people expect, they bite your head off for it.      I went in with few expectations cause the early reviews bashed it to pieces, and I was frankly not that big a fan of the original movie. In the first Cars McQueen spends an enormous amount of the movie whining, and I found him generally unlikeable until fully halfway through the movie. It was a good movie, with a lot of heart and a message, but not one I would describe as a lot of FUN. Mater especially, a little of him went a long way in the first movie, and I was really worried about him being the star of this movie, because if a little of him annoyed me in the first movie, this one has 10 times more of him.    And yet, he actually annoyed me LESS this time around, cause he had something to do instead of just hanging around being Mater. They struck a perfect balance in his 'mater-ness' where the Accidental Spy nature of his story is charming instead of just annoying. And even more to my amazement, Mater's unique perspective DOES actually help solve the mystery. He's not just a bumbling idiot gumming up the works, he does actually help.    I was also constantly amused at the imagination that went into Cars-ifying the world. Even little touches like the swanky party in Towkyo (not a typo! ha!), the elevators are giant pistons that come out of the floor. I didn't expect it at all but once I saw it was it was so perfect.    To sum up, I have to say, I enjoyed this movie MORE than the original Cars. Yet at the same time I'll fully agree that the original is a technically superior film in writing and character, but Cars 2 is way more fun. If you go into this with the right attitude, that you're seeing a James Bond movie with Cars, that it's meant to be pure fun and embrace it on that level, there's a lot to love.    The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is it IS shallow. I won't say it's a perfect film on every level cause it's not. But it doesn't deserve the hate it's getting, it's just a fun movie, and there's nothing wrong with that. If it doesn't quite transcend to the levels of brilliance of The Incredibles or Wall:E, that doesn't make it BAD, it suffers only in comparison to other Pixar work, compared to anything else, it rocks. :)
B004A8ZX28|3.0|While the acting is quite good, the story line has already been done before, rewind to The Bourne Identity.  Man gets in a car accident and wakes up can't remember who he really is and guess what?  Turns out he's an assasin and now he doesn't want to be one and hooks up with a pretty girl to help him get out of the spy ring.  Sound familiar?
B000BYCAJE|5.0|This first album by these 3 is still their best. Only the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel, Yes & maybe the Beatles  were able to combine voices as perfectly as these guys. Their control of the harmonies and melody in these songs is still surprising to the listener. The compositions (specially the totally acoustic ones) have stood the test of time marvelously. A true classic of rock music. Get it, kid.
0553801473|2.0|I just went through the reviews so I will try not to repeat what other reviewers have written.  I am a recent and enthusiastic fan of the first three books, and thought that A Feast For Crows had good enough moments for me to make it to the next book (I liked Brienne, and thought the Jaime and Cersei chapters really brought them into focus, for example), but Martin has made some terrible errors in this book, including the repetition of tired expressions, the \\"You Know Nothing\\" (13 repetitions), another reviewer mentioned the repeated cut-and-pastes of the Lord of Light execution/worship ritual), and several ghastly repeats of how someone dies of the bloody flux.  Not to mention 20 repetitions of what readers will recognize as \\"The Crossbow Incident.\\"  It is as though something went terribly wrong with Martin's word processing program and would randomly repaste entire scenes (including the Sam and Gilly departure scene from the Wall) repeated from Feast, for no apparent reason, and a long leisurely and pointless pole-boat travel down the Rhoyne.  The lowlight of the story was the bizarre and confusing debacle of the siege of Meereen and the fate of Daenerys and her dragons, along with sleight-of-hand plot changes introducing major new players in the Game of Thrones.<br /><br />I felt terribly dicked around by this story, it could have been half the length and twice as a good a book, but it seems like Martin's editors don't dare touch a word of his travelogue, because now he's the \\"American Tolkien.\\"  I can appreciate that people are anxious and excited to read what happens next with their favorite characters, what you may find bewildering is how much their personalities have changed.  I have news for Mr. Martin: if Tolkien wrote this badly (and there are incoherent sentences and paragraphs left in the published story) the world would never have heard of The Lord of the Rings.  He took 10 years, and did it badly.  Please somebody hire an editor for the next book, otherwise we'll end up on a jungle safari on Sothoros in the next one.rwise we'll end up on a jungle safari on Sothoros in the next one.
B001HN690O|5.0|Before I begin, you should know that since Toy Story my family and I have loved animated movies. We've always preferred Pixar to DreamWorks because the former is usually more family appropriate with the exception of The Incredibles. DreamWorks always has some questionable material in their movies i.e. crude humor, innuendos, language, etc... It wasn't till recently with Kung Fu Panda that DreamWorks that people want family appropriate movies for kids. Last year, How to Train Your Dragon came out and I realized: I like this movie! It was clean, not too violent, and a great movie over all! I didn't know how DreamWorks was gonna pull off a better movie. Then, along came Kung Fu Panda 2, the Citizen Kane of animated movies. There are 6 reasons that Kung Fu Panda 2 is the best animated movie.  1. Story Line: Now I don't want to spoil anything but in my opinion, this plot was great! It had some pretty good twists for a kid's movie.  2. Fights: There was some pretty sweet kung fu fighting scenes almost as good as Jet Li's Fearless! The cooperation fight scenes were very original and very well crafted. One thing I would like to have seen more is some more one on one fighting. Other then that, spectacular choreography  3. Animation: The animation on How to Train Your Dragon was pretty eye popping. The animation for Kung Fu Panda 2? Even better. Fur/hair/feathers all bend in the wind like it would on an actually animal. When wet, the fur looks wet! On the topic of water, it's some of the best looking water in an animated movie. Moves like water and looks like water. And now we come to, I believe, DreamWorks strongest area: Explosions, smoke and dust. If you saw Megamind and How to Train Your Dragon, you know what I'm talking about. It looks so cool! The smoke billows like smoke and the dust settles like dust. When it comes to this area, DreamWorks rocks!  4. Voice Casting: The actors they picked for this movie were not great. They were awesome! They fit their character perfectly. Jack Black stole the show in the first movie. In this one, he's even better but loses to Gary Oldman, who plays the albino peacock Lord Shen. He plays his role so well when I see Lord Shen, I see Gary Oldman! My only negative comment is I would've wished to see Dustin Hoffman/Shifu play a bigger role.  5. Emotional Rapport: When it comes to emotions in animated movies, Pixar usually gets mine pretty involved i.e. Up. Kung Fu Panda 2 gets your emotions involved a lot. I don't want to spoil anything, but it was probably the saddest animated movie I've ever seen! But not too sad! It also has lots of hilarious moments, embarrassing moments and (surprisingly) some dark moments. As I said previously, Gary Oldman does a spectacular job playing a crazy peacock and he may creep some little kids out. So, be warned.  6. Music: The music is very well done. Beautiful, funny, exciting and sad, John Powell and Hans Zimmer have done an even better job then the first movie! I would strongly recommend buying this music if you enjoy soundtrack.  So there you have it! DreamWorks can do some clean, emotional and epic movies. And from what I've heard, the 3D is pretty good also. Enjoy this great movie.
1451629184|5.0|I want to clear up something on one review I read before buying the book - the person was complaining about multiple pages of her writing about a cat and how unneccesary that was.  That person neglected to mention that it was not type written pages, but a photo copy of a young girl writing a diary about a cat that made her happy.  Good grief - the poor girl had no love other than that of a few animals that were typically taken from her - the person who wrote that review obviously has no sense of compassion and if you don't have any compassion then maybe you shouldn't be reading this book - cuz you won't get it.    I was personally riveted by this book.  I could not put it down.  It must have been theraputic for her to write this because in the beginning as she tells her story - she sounds just like an eleven year old girl.  You can see a transformation in her thinking as the book progressed to her adult years - yet still a wounded child lived inside her.  The sadness was there through out, but she has been groomed to push down feelings and do what was expected of her to survive.  What good would acknowledging her feelings do?      What they did to her was unforgiveable and I know that God will judge them accordingly.  They may see justice on earth but it will not compare to the justice that God will take on them for hurting a young child and taking her innocence.  And for - corrupting her mind about God.  Using the Bible to further his \\"cause\\" - he will be judged.  I hope that someday Jaycee can see God for who He is and not the distored picture that was painted for her by Phillip.  It was not the angels that were speaking to him - but instead the demons.  I know most people don't want to hear about God, but in addition to the loss of innocence and stealing away her freedom and right to happiness - he stole her right to learn and decide whether or not to have faith in God.  I don't know if she would have believed in God had this never happened, but her view of God has no doubt been corrupted by this monster as well.  It is her right to learn about God on her own and make her own decision. In order to do that, she has to weed thru the lies he told first.  That just makes me so angry because I think faith could help her and it is just another thing stolen away.    Enough of my soap box.  I recommend the book.  But if you have been sexually abused - it may be a hard read. If you choose to read it - keep in mind that she is a survivor.  Nothing he did to her - no matter how heinous - destroyed her.  Take hope in that.  We all have a journey and this is hers.
B0013FSXT6|4.0|As in most post 70's, Stanley Kubrick movies, his films are challenging, require repeated viewings and demand the viewer to work to understand what's going on.<br /><br />Similar to \\"Fatal Attraction\\", this is a warning to married men to not explore what may be thought as \\"the other side of the fence\\" and to not take for granted what is not appeared to be broken. Men, don't mess with your marriage, you may not like what is out there!<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays a successful doctor that asks questions of his wife, that he should not neccessarily want the answers, and then, after a marital argument, he ventures into the seamy ( I mean VERY SEAMY) side of after hours, New York, sampling the possible fruits of what can be had.

The utilization of such A-list stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, detracted from the microscopic, extremely personal and psychological story of a successful couple that appears to have it all yet there, nonetheless, exists a fragility that may instantly implode their perfect world. They were too big of stars however, the late Sidney Pollack is mesmerizing as Cruise's doctor cohort during the day, but a very scary, villain at night.

B000AAF1U4|5.0|This movie came out when I was a bit older so I never saw it when it originally came to theaters.  I watched it later in my 20s on the recommendation of a friend and I have to admit, it's pretty funny and a cute story.  Kronk is hilarious and is an atypical villain sidekick.<br /><br />This movie isn't really musical like the older Disney movies but it doesn't seem to detract from the movie at all.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard is one amazing soul!  I am so happy she shared her ordeal with us.  At moments, it was a bit too intense and I had to stop and take a breath; to think that she endured this pain and suffering at such a young age and survived doesn't make sense to me.  I honestly don't know how she did it!  Obviously she is a much better person than I am as I was so angry at the Garridos, the parole officers, the government, and anyone else involved in not helping this child for so many years.  The blatant mistakes that were made in rescuing Jaycee disgust me but I give credit where credit is due--Jaycee doesn't want to harbor negative feelings; she wants to move on with her life.  And what a courageous soul she is to love her daughters unconditionally!  As she said in the book and her interview, it is not their fault they were born; she is a great mom!  Kudos to her mother too for not giving up hope and for accepting Jaycee and her girls.  I do wish them all happiness and healing.  Thank you again, Jaycee, for sharing your story.  Don't miss out on this book; it is a must read!
B0007KTBIU|5.0|This is one of my favorite Disney movies, although I'd wager a lot of people consider this to be one of the worst Disney movies.  The use of color and song in this movie are key.  It's a romanticized version of the historical Pocahontas, but it's still a fun and engaging story with highs and lows.

0553579908|5.0|A Clash of Kings continues the epic story begun by George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones.  If you're looking at this book, you've probably just finished the first and can't wait to get your hands on this one to find out what happens next.  Martin really delivers in this book, escalating the danger surrounding each member of the Stark family.  The kingdom is in turmoil and as you turn the pages you hardly know who to trust.<br /><br />There are definitely some shockers in this book and the books that follow in this series.  At times you'll want to throw your book against the wall.  At times you'll sit and wonder \\"did that just happen?\\"  And at times you'll simply wonder how it will all end, and who will it end well for.  A wonderful series and this is one of the best books of the series.
0545259088|3.0|Going into this last installment of the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, I was ecstatic!!! I thought that it started out pretty much as I had anticipated, so there were no real surprises there. To be honest, I wasn't expecting any in the first half (i've thought a lot about how this series might end). The farther I got into Forever, the more it seemed like certain questions would not be answered until the very end of the book. Is the cure really and truly the cure? Cole had suggested at the end of Linger that Sam may in fact NOT be cured and that the wolf gene may just be dormant for a short while. SPOILER!! Well, that was left completely open to interpretation. I didn't like that at all. I really hate these endings that are very abrupt and leave you with more questions than answers!! The other thing I didn't like was that we don't know what happened to Cole and Isabel. Do they end up together? Does he follow her to California? We don't know that either. Another let down. Why wasn't there more going on between Grace and her parents? At the end of Linger, Grace's parents (to the best of their knowledge) had escaped from the hospital and were accusing Sam of kidnapping. I guess they really didn't care about their daughter.<br /><br />After all the negative aspects of the book, I do actually have a positive comment. It is still a fun read. I really do enjoy Maggie Steifvater's writing and hope to see more page-turners from her in the future. My only request to her is that she read through her previous books in her trilogies and make sure she answers all the questions that were left hanging in the air from previous books. I am left feeling unsatisfied with this ending. It feels like the end of book 3, not the ending of the series.
B004HO6HWA|2.0|Much has been made about Jason Statham being the great white hope for old school adrenalin pumped action, to be fair he has a better chance than some of his contemporaries, but that chance dwindles each time he makes a second rate actioner like \\"The Mechanic.\\" This is the type of movie nonsense that just a few years back was located on video store shelves exclusively, the stunts and violence are a little better visually, but the script is just as awkwardly thrown together out of cliches from previous actions movies and dialogue that just barely makes the characters form of communication above grunts and whistles. Ugh. Statham's acting is limited too and he can be easily miscast, as he is here as a remorseless killer.    This is a remake of a 1972 movie [[ASIN:B00006FDAP The Mechanic]] with Charles Bronson, while a better movie script and casting wise, it is dated, but not necessarily ripe for a remake. This storyline, older assassin training a younger person to be a killer, is pretty well worn, it does turn banal awfully quick, as it does here. Director Simon West can shoot the hell out of an effects heavy violent action scene, but that results in some outrageously absurd action scenes. The Bronson film put thought before explosions, director West may never have had a thought that didn't involve an explosion.    Still, I must give credit to Ben Foster, giving an intense performance than never once let's you see that he knows this material is beneath him. Donald Sutherland, an old pro, who can steal a scene from anyone and light up an entire movie, is wonderful for all three minutes of screen time he has. The other actors play characters who just wonder through the movie either to be killed or to kill, a few woman show up for sexual purposes, but nothing more.     This is the kind of movie that leaves you empty and cold. Not because of the subject matter, it's not taken seriously enough for that. Nor is it the characters, their is no depth to them for that. It's justsuch trite material, it can't work up any emotions at all. If Jason Statham hopes to fill the shoes of Stallone, Van Damme, Lundgren, Arnold or Bronson, before them, he needs to start making films with some sort of emotional center. His [[ASIN:B000FKO3WG The Transporter Collection]] is a better example of Statham filling their large shoes, here he plays a hero we give a damn about, he is easily likable in most roles he plays, but none of that comes across here. In the end, the Stath ends up as dull as the film itself, but an amiable hero such as he, will have another go around, let's hope that one lives up more to the promise. If it doesn't, Shia La Beuf may be the next action legend. Ugh.

B00110K62U|5.0|This is unquestionably the most enjoyable DVD I have ever purchased.  With the sole shortcoming of Nick Jonas (particularly compared with Michael Ball), the cast is stellar and the disc eminenty re-watchable.  I do not expect to see another live \\"Les Miz\\". as I would always be comparing.  As to Colm vs. Alfie--they are different (and both superb).  I am grateful that I have lived in a time when such joy is available to me ANYTIME I wish!
0671207822|5.0|I was given this book by my psychotherapist while I was suffering a deep and long-term depression. I cannot understate just how crucial this book was in helping overcome that depression. I realize that not everybody will have the same reaction to this book as I had, but I do sincerely believe that everyone's life can become at least slightly better after having read it. Dr. Frankl is not your average psychotherapist. In the book, he tries to explain the \\"existential vacuum\\" that he believes is the ultimate underlying cause of our mental neuroses. Frankl argues that the human creature needs a purpose or a meaning for which to live, otherwise he sinks into a deeply nihilistic, life-denying depression. This purpose or meaning is unique for each individual, and it can even change over time. Frankl believed that life was full of suffering and pain, and that quite often there is very little we can do to alleviate it - except to find a meaning or purpose that can help us to overcome it. Without a meaning or purpose in life, the individual would have little reason to get out of bed to face each day's challenges. Meaning overcomes suffering. Meaning defeats nihilism. That is the core message of Dr. Frankl's book. It is a message that I myself need to hear and learn in order to win the battle against my depression. It is also a message that I believe that many, many modern people need to hear and understand because we live in a world that is increasingly dominated by depression, apathy, and nihilism. \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\" teaches us that we can create our own meaning in life - a meaning that is uniquely situated to us and the suffering that we individually struggle against. Out of the empty vacuum of existential nothingness, the human being can create his own meaning or purpose in life. Just because the universe or life itself may have no inherent meaning, we can still create meaning on our own. Indeed, Dr. Frankl says that this is the highest achievement to which the human being can aspire - to create his or her own meaning in life despite the suffering and emptiness of existence. Dr. Frankl's own life proves that this is so: he managed to create his own meaning in the death and concentration camps of the Holocaust. If the human being can create meaning there, then it is possible to do so anywhere. Dr. Frankl's own life experiences serve as evidence and testament to the truth of his ideas. The human being can create meaning and purpose no matter the suffering and torment that the universe throws at him. This is a very powerful and compelling message, in my opinion. But, do not take my word for it, read the book for yourself!

0143114085|2.0|This book, while it definitely sucked me in right away, was unrealistic and improbable.  It was just an odd book.  I really didn't like it that the reader is told lies throughout and there is no way to know the truth until the end (no clues like a good mystery).  Also, the main character supposedly had a c-section -- there is absolutely no way that she would be able to move like she did in the book two weeks after giving birth.  A disappointing read that I would not recommend.

0553801473|1.0|I don't mind books that are slow moving, but my patience is being tested with this series.<br /><br />While ADWD at least fixes one of the major problems with AFfC since it does include the POVs of popular characters like Jon, Bran and Dany, each character faces more and more challenges and failures.  But it doesn't seem to be leading to anything. It's just going on and on with new secondary plots being introduced, but the overall plot of the series is no closer to any resolution.<br /><br />Like a AFfC, there are still too many random characters with POV chapters that add nothing to the overall story other than filler.  I found myself skimming over some chapters because they simply weren't compelling and I had no interest in what was going on.<br /><br />At the end of ADWD, I was left with a lack of hope for both the characters and the storyline.  It's now a series of disjointed storylines with the empty promise of a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />With only two books left, I have my doubts about how the series will wrap up. But I'm fully expecting GRRM to announce that ASoIaF will be a 10 book series now.

B004LWZW24|5.0|this is not a review per se (because i won't describe the plot or actors--you can search that on your own) but wanted to say this is a scary movie! not the stupid hollywood kind where a bunch of teens are knocked off one by one but a very quality, well-made horror movie with lots of spooky atmosphere (what producers and directors seem to miss every time and that's what makes a scary movie). It has a haunted house, demon possession, astral progection, talented adult actors who aren't having sex and kissing all the time, and most of all the foggy spooky atmosphere that makes it scary. i have loved horror since the 60's and haven't seen too many good ones that really scare me except The Exorcist, Silence of the Lambs and some lesser known films. I actually had to turn all the lights on in the house after seeing this movie and i'm an old guy! Highly Recommended! Please make more like this one and stop with the teenagers being slashed BS. Thanks for reading!

0143034901|5.0|It is 1945, and as Barcelona, Spain and Europe emerge from war, Daniel, the son of a book seller finds himself enthralled by a novel by an unkown author named Juli&aacute;n Carax.  He wants to read more, but as he begins to look for more books by Carax, he finds that someone has been hunting down and burning every copy of Carax's work.  As Daniel continues his search, he finds himself drawn into an old and dark mystery of love and betrayal.  In the end, he learns the disturbing truth about Carax and his circle of friends and rescues Carax's literary legacy from the ashes.<br /><br />Set during and around the period of the Spanish civil war, we are immersed in the Barcelona of that period with its class and political struggles and the far reaching consequences they had in the lives of those that lived in that time and place.  As Daniel struggles to understand his place in the world, he also finds himself working to find out about Carax's life at the same age.  The parallel love stories that develop in the two timelines reflect each other and form a framework that allows Daniel to learn lessons from Carax's life that he can apply to his own.  Along the way, we meet an array of colorful characters that bring the story to life and present a vibrant sense of time and place to the setting.  Gorgeous imagery combine with a deftly woven mystery to draw in the reader and keep him or her enchanted until the very end.
B001GCUO5M|2.0|The scenarist of this movie probably had lots of schemes before him while working on that project as otherwise he could not have made this story due to innumerable twists and turns he introduced.  But the viewers have no such help.  They have to try to keep the track of all that's happening right now and right there.  Perhaps some can but there is absolutely no need to go to movies to be bothered with such hocus pocus.  Try linking the beginning of this movie and its end -  the two have absolutely nothing in common.  That's the major problem of this movie - it only exists for real in the head of its scenarist.  Scorsese skillfully directed although with lots of quite cheap horrors tricks (rats, hurricane), a forgettable piece in his career.  Di Caprio and Ruffalo do well, the best part of the feature.  There is so much cockiness in other roles and such posturing that I find it really hard to bear (not actors' faults though).  The best example is Kingsley who was well cast but the role he's got is totally unbearable.  All in all, completely disappointing.
B0043GXYBO|3.0|When I first picked up Marked the cover looked very interesting. Through out reading this book however, it has not lived up to the promise I had hoped for. The characters are immature, I am only 14 and wouldn't behave or speak like they do. I also had trouble finishing this book because being a Christian I did not appreciate the open hostility toward Christians in the book. Even if it is a book about Vampires I don't feel it's necessary to sterotype another group so negatively. Other books manage to cover this subject without attacking Christians. To be fair, the story line/plot was a nice change from other books in this genre. I would recommend this book only to someone who is stranded on an island with no hope of rescue and nothing else to read.
B002UXRH10|4.0|Her singing is the biggest issue in an otherwise pretty good CD.  Such a bad performance of R, did not expect it, mostly out of tune or spirit of the music.  The lyrics is occasionally unbearable, almost idiotic, not that I pay much attention but c'mon.  Yet, most of the songs are well crafted and if you can stand the singing they sound pretty good, some being really, really good.  That's the reason for 4*.  BTW, her racy photos come across well but am wondering what sort of message she's putting forward.

My favorite songs are \\"Talking to the Moon\\", \\"Grenade\\", \\"Just the Way You Are\\", \\"Runaway Baby\\", \\"Marry You\\" & \\"Our First Time\\". Bruno Mars' music is a combination of classic rock n'roll, pop, r&b and Reggae. Overall this is a great album and I like the refreshing sound of music it consists of. Bruno Mars' debut \\"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\\" is definitely a new sound in music of today in it's own right, creating it's own new genre. Bruno plays many instruments as well, that's what makes him and his music so unique. I recommend Doo-Wops & Hooligans for anyone who wants to hear a fresh new sound in music.

0061777250|5.0|This is a tough read in places, but fascinating. The most scientific treatment of the subject I have seen. Not hearsay accounts of NDE rather a scientific treatise on the subject based on years of objective data collected by a team of researchers (doctors & nurses) with observations verified and cataloged. Also, a pleasant stroll through quantum physics that opens the door to a possible explanation of the unexplainable.<br /><br />Does Dr. Van Lommel claim to know all of the answers? Certainly not, but he does provide enough science for thinking people to open the door to consider the unbelievable.<br /><br />Interestingly, some of the negative comments in other reviews reflect reader bias, not the book itself. Von Lommel considers all known phenomena of the topic, he does not pick and choose what is convenient to fit an a priori opinion or belief system.<br /><br />Is this a \\"proof\\" of consciousness apart from the living brain? Strictly speaking, I would say not, but it takes you all of the way to the front door. It is up to the reader to choose whether they want to open the door, just slightly, and look in. By the way, this is not a \\"religious book\\" although for some it will overlap their personal faith beliefs (possibly in a positive or negative manner).<br /><br />Any thinking person who does not consider this book a fantastic read is not being honest. For some, it might even provide ample evidence to reconsider their ideas about consciousness after death.
B000066AXE|4.0|Have been learning about transitioning books to screen, so read the book, A Beautiful Mind, first, then read the screen play.  I had not seen the film.  Reading the screen play immediately set me off in sudden  outbursts of laughter,  simply at the surprises that continually would appear in the script which had nothing to do with the book.  In fact, there is very little of the book in the screen play.  By the end I discovered that the screen play is described as a story inspired by the life of John Nash and the book, A Beautiful Mind.      Taken alone, the script is a good study in turning the story into an adventure, complete with gun battles and car chase; in fact, the idea of mental illness and an ill math genius who wins a nobel prize, is   the jumping off point for this somewhat James Bond romp.  But to be fair, it is developed, independent from the book or the mental disease, into an entertaining and moving story.    If you read the script, I suggest that you also buy the Two-Disc Awards Edition DVD which goes into great depth as to the scripting, the casting, the filming, effects creation, and much more. An enormous amount of care was taken in turning the actual story into an  \\"it couldda happened\\"  film.. inspired by the life of John Nash, but almost entirely fictional.  It is a well scripted, wittilly dialogued, and interesting fantasia based upon a situation which had similar circumstances.  The script leaves the John Nash character on a \\"reality diet\\" where he still is haunted by the presence of his other characters his mind has created, but which he now has learned to ignore.  In fact, the real John Nash has almost no memory of his fantasies and has no remaining \\"hauntings\\" of them now. But hey, this is Hollywood, and they always have trouble discerning reality from fantasy.    Bottom line: it is well written, entertaining, and interesting in that we see an example of how a mostly internalized book can inspire an actualized film, suggested by the circumstances the book contains, and then elaborately produced.

1582701709|2.0|The Secret really carries a great message. It explains some of the details of how to use positive thinking and has some good quotes. The problem for me was that the writing was actually kind of boring and seemed poorly organized with a lot of filler content. Honestly, this should have been a brief pmaphlet, not a book. But, the message is worth the price of the book. Read it for that and not for the writing quality.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This is a book that I couldn't put down, to walk with her thru the worst 18 years of her life and to see such a sweet loving person emerge jut filled my heart.  I commend Ms. Dugard for not letting herself beome a venageful full of hate person.  She has shown what a great loving heart she has and wasn't going to let the Garridos steal that from her.
0670022411|2.0|I really liked the original premise and patiently waited for the book to somehow eventually bloom. It didn't. I finished it just now and never received satisfaction. The characters were 2-dimensional. The really potentially exciting parts were not fully flushed out and assumed way too much \\"I'll go with it\\" devotion from the reader. My mind was always having to convince my feelings that what I had read had depth, horror, exceptional courage or life transcending love. I would re-read a page over and over to feel it and finally decided to just move on and maybe it would make sense later. I agree with the other women who were aghast at Diana's fast abdication of her original personality for her \\"man,\\" or rather vamp. I expected so much more from Diana! We learned what a special person she was; how smart, talented, educated, gifted beyond anything comprehensible. Yet she continues to be unable to flush out a simple spell, react in a meaningful way or time, let loose the ties that spellbound her or basically do any magic that would have been quite useful. And yes, her naps, toast gorging and leggings went too far. I often wondered what Matthew saw in her. The romance between Diana and Matt the vamp was vapid. Where was the heat? Yeah, he \\"spooned\\" with her and acted protective, but more in the interest of animal instinctiveness or protecting their future progeny. I just didn't feel it. And no, they didn't consummate their \\"marriage\\" anywhere during the book. I couldn't even get a clear picture of Diana and Matthew. So maybe not even as good as 2D. I have also been reading Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series and I came across certain pages that seemed to appropriate them into their own. Where DG's books read like you were really there, this book never could take me no matter how much I complied or begged. The end came and, while I was left with very little for my hours of reading, I was not surprised. Couldn't she have thrown us a bone? Something to say AHA! about? Some curiosity for what would happen next? The book is titled \\"A Discovery of Witches,\\" and after finishing the book, I still do not know what that refers to. You could have blown up balloons and drew faces on them for Nathaniel and Sophie or Marcus and Miriam and achieved the same feeling of their company. Enough. Maybe this is just a first book that will get better? I'm just a cock-eyed optimist ;o)

Son músicos realmente talentosos y no necesitan hacer el mismo disco una y otra vez. Si usted es una persona a la que le gustan los grupos con valor y que se atreven a intentar cosas nuevas en la música, que no viven del pasado y que tratan de romper barreras musicales, entonces definitivamente tienen que escuchar éste disco. Es orbid Angel y no es Morbid Angel.
0393316041|3.0|I found it difficult to come up with a rating for this book, so I settled for a mealy-mouthed 3 star. On the one hand, I found the book to be interesting and entertaining, if not taken too seriously. It seems that many reviewers who gave it either a 5 star rating or 1 star rating took it too seriously indeed. It's a collection of STORIES, for gosh sakes, and although I have no doubt that most, if not all of the settings are accurate, and the parts of the events related actually took place, they were clearly enhanced for the sake of just telling a better story.      For example he tells the story of going from Los Alamos to Albuquerque to visit his dying wife. How do you make an interesting story out of that? Well, Feynman has himself borrowing a car from the Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs, whom Feynman really did know, then having several break-downs on the way, finally arriving just hours before his wife's death. Could have happened like that, but when you see someone claiming that his whole life was a succession of similar tales, you have to understand that there's a lot of enhancing going on.     I suspect that many of the tales of Feynman's mental prowess, cloaked in an aw shucks country boy attitude (he was from New York City, by the way) are intended more to entertain than to self-aggrandize. In at least one case, his prowess is revealed not to be quite so great as he would have us believe. After aw-shucks-ing his way to the fact that learned to speak Portuguese in a few months, he makes a very simple error in the only Portuguese dialog in the book, confusing the Spanish for 'I don't know' with the Portuguese.     So if you want some light entertainment, along with a little history of mid-20th century physics, by all means pick up a copy. Just don't take it too seriously.
0451219597|4.0|This was my second adventure with Follet and it proved to be a wonderful one. The story line follows that of the one about the \\"Dirty Dozen\\". Only here he makes several adjustments in tone, action, and characters. First, the goal is the same to disrupt or destroy a Nazi phone exchange terminal in France just prior to the allied invasion of France. A female resistance fighter makes an attempt at this with a team of resistance fighters and they fail because of poor intelligence about the facility. Some of the men are killed, some captured and later tortured, and a few escape including the ring leader who also happens to be the husband of the female agent. The female agent returns to London with a plan on how to do the job, but it is first turned down and then later approved.<br /><br />The team to do the job is selected from a variety of people and they are all women except for one who is a male cross dresser. Interestingly enough the number on the team is six, or a \\"half-dozen\\". The team trains and fights among themselves based on their various backgrounds and characteristics. Finally, the big day comes and the night before the team is given a final test where one of them fails because she disclosed the mission to a stranger who is a member of the RAF and working to check the team's ability to not disclose the mission. This member is sent packing, but appears later with a high ranking officer because she is the daughter of a high government official and the female team leader is told she has to reinstate her. The team leader says, \\"No\\" and is backed up by others in MI6.<br /><br />In the mean time the Gestapo has questioned and tortured the captured resistance fighters and has learned how other members are added to the group from England and where they make contact. The local contact is captured, tortured, and replaced by a person working with the Germans who later meets agents and then hands them over to the Nazis. One of the agents that is captured has a radio and the Nazis now have the codes and radio frequencies needed to contact England's inner circle of spies working in France. As you may guess the story continues with the Nazis learning of the attempt by the resistance to damage a vital supply line. The female agents are supposed to do the job, but the real target is the telepone exchange again. There's a lot of cat and mouse play between the team leader and the Nazis which is fun to read and the Nazis do catch a few of the team members, but the team leader continues to outwit the Nazi detective at a number of turns in the later part of the story as she and her remaining team prepare to destroy the telephone exchange building and equipment.<br /><br />The ending is clever and action packed. Any reader of mystery and thriller books will really enjoy the last forty or so pages. The book is an easy read and at several points hard to put down.

1600595871|5.0|I had been trying to break away from traditional methods of binding books and then I found 'Making Handmade Books' by Alisa Golden.   This book is so full of new and different ideas, I hardly know where to start.   But, start I will.  It contains instructions on how to go about the project with plenty of detail and sketches.  I love it!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Let me preface by saying that this is my opinion based on my musical tastes.  Just to give you an idea, my 4 favorite bands are Sublime, TOOL, the Killers, Mars Volta.  Awolnation is quickly climbing my list.  With that said, here is my review of Megalithic Symphony.  The lead singer's voice is the best I've heard in a very long time.  I'm one to get annoyed if I don't like the singer.  Very refreshing from all the other crap that is out there.  As for the album as a whole, I give it a 9 (the only 10 I have ever given was for TOOL's Aenima album).  After 5 playthroughs, I haven't had the urge to skip a track yet (well maybe the bonus track).  The creativity is a 10 in my book and it all comes together nicely.  The beats are crazy good and I can see DJs and Rappers having fun with some of the stuff in this album.  For each song I gave it an initial rating from the first playthrough and a final rating based on 5 complete cycles.  Although I do give out some 5s and 6s, its only to have some separation in my ratings.  In all honesty each track would not have received less than an 8 because they all have their own unique hook that keeps you coming back.    Track 1,2,9: Fillers/Transition tracks.  The placement of 9 in the album was interesting.    9.5/10   Soul Wars - Can I get a litlle AMEN!  Started off as a 9 rating on the first playthrough and kept getting better.  Gets you pumped up.    8.5/10   People - Started out as a 6 rating and keeps getting better.  Reminds me of a Killers track.      6.5/10   Jump on my Shoulders - Fun song.  Started at a 7.5 and fell off a bit.      6.5/10   Burn it Down - a little repetitive for my taste.  Started at a 6 and stayed there.   The second half of the song would get an 8 rating.    8.0/10   Guilty Filthy Soul - Reminds me of a Jack White track.  This started as a 9.  Only reason I decreased the rating is that other tracks started standing out more.    6.0/10   Kill Your Heroes - This started at an 8.5.  Dont know what happened.The hook still gets me singing tho.    9.0/10   Sail - Started as a 10 for me.  Just waiting for JayZ or Timbaland to sample this one.  Reminds me of sex.    5.5/10   Wake Up - I hated this song on the first playthrough and gave it a 3 but it got better.  Reminds me of a Maroon5 track.    7.5/10   Not Your Fault - the chorus is great.  This song was ranked higher on my first playthrough at an 8.5.  Parts of it reminds me of an MCR track.    10/10   All I Need - This started at a 7 for me and quickly became my favorite on the album.  Best lyrics on the album hands down.  Reminds me of something out of Jesus Christ Superstar.    9.9/10   Knights of Shame - The rating for this track kept changing up and down.  Everything is in this song.  Each section becomes a new favorite with each listen.  The beats are sick.  Parts remind me of Bob James.    5.0/10  Swinging from the Castles - Just couldn't fully appreciate this one.  It actually started off a little higher at 6.5.
0790729628|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies ever. This movie is similar to a video game in terms of atmosphere and lure. I was drawn in to this movie like no other. People say it is a dark movie which is true, but not completely. There are scenes that show love and redemption, which stand out. The scene before the last is absolutely spectacular. If you think star wars is good you will be in for a surprise when you see blade runner which blows away star wars in depth and real human dialog. The most unique thing about this movie is that it doesn't seem the people are acting. The movie is a classic and I would recommend it to anyone.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Always loved the first one in the series. But having all four to watch is a real treat. I really appreciate the work put into this series. Except for a few too many coincidences in plot, the series is well-written and extremely effective. I forgot how violent movies in the 80's and 90's were. Well-worth the price.

B002U0KHMY|5.0|White collar criminal turned FBI consultant, what better could you start off with? The slickest steal-you-blind-while-you-laugh-at-my-joke criminal ever caught teamed with a straight-laced, by-the-book, happily married FBI agent and a few other distinct characters catching the bad guys with no gorey, grisley images or needless bedroom sequences. It's a great show, every episode is discinctive, and there's a secret back plot going on throughout the entire series.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Wasn't sure what I was going to get for a such a low price but I am more than happy with this product. It's got a 20 foot cord that connects to my Canon 60D that's perfect for interviewing for the documentaries that I shoot. I recently did an interview on a noisy rooftop in Downtown Los Angeles and the ATR3350 performed incredibly at capturing my subjects voice and NOT the surrounding noises.<br /><br />I'd strongly recommend this mic for anyone who's looking for a cheaper alternative to more pricey sound equipment for interviews.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|For ME, Beyonce's gone from Sasha Fierce to Sasha WORSE.  You be the judge.  She excels at cutting edge funk numbers and soulful balladry, but for some inexplicable reason, dabbles instead in contemporary Pop-oriented slop.  Though both albums have their share of great songs, both boast their fair share of crappy filler items too.  So far, I've yet to be blown away completely by a Beyonce CD since 2006's \\"B-Day.\\"  She appears to be losing her ground. At first, \\"4\\" is NOT a very friendly album to the ears, but it slowly improves with repeated listens IF you're willing to give it a chance.<br /><br />Of all the songs on \\"4,\\" the ones I most gravitate toward are \\"Best Thing I Never Had,\\" (a Babyface composition which leans so far into Pop territory, that it reminds me of \\"Irreplaceable\\"), \\"Party,\\" \\"Love on Top,\\" (a \\"Deja Vu\\"-ish kind of jam) and \\"Who Run the World (Girls.\\")  Sadly, the latter was a total flop and nothing else on the entire album even matches its rhythmic greatness.  It should have been a #1 smash hit across the board.  This is a GOOD album, BUT, it is FAR from her best and does NOT hold a candle to the Hip-Hop inspired excellence of her first two solo releases.  I listened with a more open mind, upped my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars and furthered my commentary so as to better indicate the pro's and con's here.  After already two failed singles, I'm astonished that the album is doing so well on the Billboard Top 200.  It debuted at #1.  She definitely went from Sasha Fierce to Sasha WORSE and I struggle just to get through it with patience each time I play it.  It's a tad TOO Pop-focused for MY tastes.
0061537969|5.0|[[ASIN:B0017SWPXY The Art of Racing in the Rain]]I've never been a fan of car racing but this did grab my attention, due mainly to Enzo.  Enzo is truly a dog among dogs.  He is totally charming in his thinking processes and adaptability to not having an opposing thumb. His love of car racing and at one point being able to enjoy it was heart-warming.  This is all together a book I would high recommend.  In fact, I have read it three times and bought it for friends.

B004A8ZX32|4.0|I empathize with the reviewer who was troubled by some negative reaction in the theater, especially from older folks (I'm 62, so am one). It was the same at my theater, again an art house place where people would expect something different. One old guy was yelling out in the parking for all the world to hear, \\"This is the worst movie in the world.\\" He was so upset about it that I thought this film had actually struck an emotional chord in him, albeit a sour note. Perhaps being older and closer to a walk on that beach in the movie's final scenes was very disturbing to him and many folks over 60.     People have gone to this film expecting the normal arc of a \\"movie,\\" with a situation being set, characters rising to it or not, a crisis and finally a resolution. This film, thank goodness, has no such arc. Instead, it has a much broader perspective of a a much bigger and more important arc: life on earth and in the cosmos, as indicated by the title of the film. If you are not prepared for such an experience, or willing to consider it, then this movie only will frustrate you.    I thought I was ready for it, having seen all of Malick's earlier films and being somewhat in line with his world view, but even I was taken aback. I plan on seeing this again, but only at home on a Blu Ray DVD, where I can enjoy and contemplate the beauty and message of the film in peace and quiet. I've been reviewing his earlier films in preparation for that, notably Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line, and The New World. And there are numerous similarities and recurring themes (from different perspectives) from those to this new one. Truly, this is a body of work, or more to the point, a heart and soul of work.

B003L77GG0|5.0|I own every season of Smallville on box set and am so looking forward to Season 10's box set as well.  This season culminated in the most satisfying series finale that I have ever seen on a television show to date.  As a fan of Superman since I was a little girl, this series from the start was refreshing in the fact that it was the journey of Clark Kent to become the Superman everyone knows and loves.  The finale definitely delivered, from the tights, to the flight, and finally at the end, the music that has raised goosebumps on every fan's arm since we first heard it.  Congrats to everyone who had a part on Smallville for a job well done.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed this movie.  I'm wondering what got cut out of it because in some places it's hard to follow, like as if something is missing.  It was hard to understand the motivation for the villan, Hector Hammond, and how the monster with the big head fit into the plot. Carol Ferris and some of the other characters were more cardboard-like, but the actor who played Green Lantern did a great job of bringing him to life and of fleshing out Hal Jordan as well.  The other thing about it that I was a little disappointed with is how they had a sequence where Green Lantern saves a crowd from a falling helicopter and then meets Carol  on the balcony of her apartment.  It was so much like Superman:The Movie, and I think the plot could have been more original in that regard. The appearances of the Guardians on OA is mostly good, and I like the makeup on Sinestro especially.  The action is really good and the special effects are great, and all things considered it is a fun movie to watch so I recommend it.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|A Dance with Dragons shows Martin at his best again.  This book is gripping and tends to avoid giving POV's to annoying, angst-ridden characters, unless they are about to die.<br /><br />Roose Bolton proves to have three dimensions to his character, while--to his disappointment--Ramsay remains utterly 2-D.  Ramsay is less a person and more a tattoo of a madman on a piece of human skin stretched out flat.  Under Ramsay's careful tutelage Theon Greyjoy tries to redefine \\"redemption\\" in a way that even Brienne of Tarth would take note of but Brienne-haters may take joy from the fact that the Maid of Tarth herself has NO POV in this book.<br /><br />Also lacking any real presence are Samwell Tarly (except for his Castle Black departure scene) along with the cast of Old Town, Euron Greyjoy and his cast of animated underwater friends: Spongebodkin Fingerdance and the rest (although brother Victarion has a strong presence), and anything more than a single whistful mention of Petyr Baelish by someone reminiscing over the good old days when King's Landing had any coins.<br /><br />Most of the action takes place in the east, where nothing goes as planned in Mereen, absolutely nothing. It is a wonder that although Valyria built so many roads of such straight and durable perfection, no one who travels them ever manages to travel them directly--not if they are characters in this book, at least.  I will have to re-read these sections with careful reference to the maps to determine how Tyrion and the three--yes, three, and none of them include Archmaester Maerwyn--other parties finally make their way to almost maybe actually arrive in Mereen by the end of the book.  Well, the journey is half the pleasure, or in this case, half the pain.  The other half of the pain is redeemable upon arrival in Mereen.  For most characters this other half is deferred until the next book.<br /><br />In the North, well, I don't want to talk about the north.  A great many things happen up there but Martin has thrown some cliffhangers at us and it may be that the wrong people are hanging off the cliff.  Indeed, near the end of this book I felt we had almost come full circle to the end of the first book, except without knowing for sure if Eddard Stark were dead.  Is a character dead if you didn't really see him die?  I am thinking not, but I am imagining the assassination scene in The Godfather, but with daggers instead of bullets.  And then the movie ends.  I am not going to wait five years.  Again.  At least Bran finds his three-eyed crow and has the logical rules of skinchangers, greenseers, weirwoods and even the old gods finally explained to him.  It actually makes a lot of sense and could have been ascertained from all the hints in the earlier books.  But you didn't figure it out either.<br /><br />See you in 2016 when he publishes the next one.<br /><br />Best Line in the book: \\"The gods are not done with me. Lord Ramsay is not done with me.\\"--Theon Greyjoy.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|After seeing the Diane Sawyer interview with Jaycee Dugard, I was very intrigued with Jaycee and amazed at her positive attitude and outlook. Simply put, Jaycee is an inspiration and a wonderful example of strength and courage under the worst of circumstances. Her writing in the beginning is almost childlike, but given that she was 11 when she was kidnapped, it makes complete sense. The book is a quick read and I found myself with my mouth hanging open at times in complete shock at what she endured. Yes, parts are very disturbing, but her triumph is an example to all.
0553801473|4.0|As always, George R.R. Martin is a fantastic worldbuilder and storyteller. It's easy to get swept away into Westoros. Between the return of old favorite characters, the addition of new favorites and the thickening of the plot, there was a lot here to love.<br /><br />On the other hand, the book is dense, and the pacing can be a little frustrating, especially when people are taking medieval road trips that seem to be moving at a slug's pace.<br /><br />Like its brother, Feast of Crows, Dance With Dragons is a turning point in the series. This feels like it's going away from the mystery/political conflict that drove the first few books and becomes more of a travelogue. So there's a heavy heaping of wonder--I appreciated the idea of a magic leper type camp especially--along with lots of legends to unravel, but I think fans may miss the tightly wound plot of the first few books. Earlier, most of the storylines took place on the same continent and you could see more directly how characters' decisions affected one another. This time around, the threads feel too spaced out. And the twists' similarities to those in earlier books, along with sometimes heavy-handed foreshadowing, means that there are fewer bang-out, jaw-dropping moments of surprise, which used to pretty much be what these books were based on.<br /><br />There's definitely also a sense of 'darkest before the dawn.' We're hitting the middle of the series, which means that characters are going to suffer. And some of them suffer hard. There are no good choices, and some of the bright spots that used to lighten the tortured characters' souls are missing. Maybe fewer heads roll here, but it felt to me that this book offered fewer servings of hope or heroics than any other book in the series outside Feast of Crows. And pretty much every plot ends on a cliffhanger, so don't expect too much satisfaction on that score.<br /><br />With all that said, would I still recommend A Dance with Dragons? Yes. For its flaws, thisstill kept me up well past my bedtime.  I may not have liked this one as much as Storm of Swords, despite their comparable length, but it's still George R.R. Martin. And he's still fantastic. I feel like we're in capable hands. And some things are best savored at their own pace.
0307716511|4.0|Going on the assumption that you've read the Amazon review - Tess is missing and Bee leaves NY for London.  Eventually the police find Tess's body and, with a closer look, all avenues point to suicide.    Bee's beside herself with grief and continues living in Tess's flat, getting to know all her friends and visiting all the places her sister Tess visited: college, work, hospital, etc.  This helps her feel close to her sister Tess and all the while Bee maintains that her sister would never kill herself.  In the midst of Bee's unofficial investigation of this so called suicide, she learns such wonderful things about Tess's way of life and beliefs and, in the end, she realizes that she's finally finding herself through her sisters shoes.       After having read this, I have to say that I really did enjoy the book.  While others found Bee's actions monotonous I found the web of tracking down the truth to be enthralling.  This timeline novel is, first and foremost, Bee writing a letter to her sister Tess documenting the steps Bee has taken from the day she learned of her sister's disappearance till the present.  Privately including snippets of memories between the sisters as children, in emails, phone calls and more, this diary is actually a testimony Bess is giving a detective about Tess's demise.    I don't want to ruin the story for anyone and will go no farther.  When reading the last word and closing the book, I had to think about what I had just read because the clues where there - hidden perfectly....and I missed them entirely.  FYI I particulary liked Bess's justification for people putting flowers and stuffed animals at sites of the dead - she looks at this in a way I've never thought of in my years.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|Story line and acting are not great but good enough to watch the series.  But, there is entirely too much emphasis on the slashing and fake blood splattering everywhere.  It really adds nothing to the viewing enjoyment.
B00432QAKK|4.0|I have loved this show for many years,this complete series set is top notch ,the only reason I gave only 4 stars instead of 5 is there is no episode guide,it would be great to have a list of the episodes with a short description of each one.i just downloaded an episode guide from the net printed it out and slipped it into the box. other than that I would say its worth every penny  : )
0545128285|4.0|I enjoyed this book. That being said, if you are interesting in buying it, you'll have to consider a couple of things:    -This is intended as a children's book (as it was in HP7, following along those lines)    -Sure, it's short, but it's not a full-length HP book, nor is it intended as anything, really, other than entertainment for those readers who fell in love with Book 7.     -You'll once again get to read J.K.'s style, but you'll want more, substantively and quantitatively, if you expect a full HP book.      Thus, I enjoyed the book for what it was meant to be: a sideshow into the Harry Potter world and a production of a set of fairytales from the wizarding world. The standards, in this respect, are good, but you'll of course be disappointed if you go into reading this as if it were a new main storyline release.
0545259088|3.0|I've been reading lots of series lately including this one. In every other series I've read there are some hints to the important aspects of the previous installments at the beginning of the book. It's been many months since I read Linger and Shiver so I was hoping to find the same in this book. I've read about 11% of the book so far and I'm lost and frustrated! Reading is an outlet for me to relax so I don't feel like I should be working this hard to make sense of things.     Can anyone point me to a full synopsis of the first two books so I can remember details better and actually enjoy reading this book?
B001UV4XHY|2.0|\\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1\\" is the worst of the Potter films, by far.  The story is meandering and pointless, the look of the film is dreary, and the acting not especially good.  Admittedly, the movie attempts to recreate a very large book, showing only the first half of the book in this film, which is a big part of the problem - the movie has no ending, no climax, no closure, and no point.  Perhaps Part 2 will be better, but my advice is to read the books and skip the films, which are just a feeble reflection of the stories.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This is one of the two brightest handheld lights I own, and compared to the Stanley HID spotlight it shares that title with, it's much lighter, more convenient, can be turned down when you don't need to barbecue wild game at 50 feet, the spot and throw is better, and it takes readily-available, easily-replaceable batteries.      There's really little not to like.  Yes, $100+ is a good chunk of change for a flashlight, but when you need night-cutting power, this thing is worth the money.  And it's much less than some comparable lighting I've seen.  Even my Stanley HID was $70 and it doesn't have the features this thing does.    It seems to be well-made, though I have not subjected it to any drop tests or subdued any assailants after blinding them or anything.  (And I have no doubt it would temporarily blind them; the strobe feature on high in my house gave me a headache :)    Since I'm not a frequent user of the light, and don't keep it plugged into a charger, I've filled it with Sanyo Eneloop low-self-discharge NiMH batteries.  The DC-DC converter in the light runs just fine on them, and I can leave it sitting for 6 months or more and still have a usable flashlight when I need it.  I looked for hours to find a bright light that didn't take some special Li-ion battery; thank you Fenix for making one!  Note that Fenix recommends you unscrew the headpiece a few turns to prevent some sort of trickle current from draining the batteries (I guess that is maybe for remembering your last mode, or powering the \\"soft\\" button switch electronics).    The flashlight comes in a sturdy plastic case, and with spare O-rings.  The O-rings are a nice touch, as once you go through the supplied ones you can probably replace them at a hardware store if need be.  The case is nice, too.  While I doubt I'll use it, it probably did protect the light during shipping as Amazon ONCE AGAIN laid it directly on the bottom of the box with no padding.  Grr.    The only minor improvements I'd make would be a \\"hard\\" switch or other mechanism to totally disconnect battery power (or drop that trickle current into the uA range), and maybe a lens and adjustable beam like my little Nebos have.  Trivial quibbles, though.  A fine product.
6305127697|5.0|This thriller, to me, was spectacular. When an archbishop is found brutally murdered, the police hasten to bring the killer to justice, finding an altar boy (Edward Norton) fleeing the scene of the crime covered in blood. When a famous defense lawyer (Richard Gere) chooses to defend the seemingly harmless, stuttering youth, the trial takes a twist, as the prosecution is led by Gere's character's ex-girlfriend.    As the trial unfolds, there is no question that the plot requires some thought. The thriller, and the ending, is great. What truly makes the movie worth watching, however, is the acting. Gere is great as the defense lawyer, portraying himself as a ladies man, yet faulted, and as a caring individual. Young Edward Norton's acting is phenomenal. He makes the movie every time he goes on screen!    A+. Enjoy!
0061537969|3.0|First of all I have cats not dogs, and secondly racecar driving has never interested me in the slightest.  However, I liked this book so much more than I thought I would. Hearing the story from the perspective of Enzo the dog was actually quite fun.  I loved his ideas on how to be happy and what it means to live a right and correct life.  This dog even said some things that made me stop and think about how I live my life.  Crazy.
B00003CY5J|5.0|This movie has everything a good heist movie should have. It gives you enough of a glimpse of the workings of a safe to make you feel you've garnered some inside information. Locksmiths who specialize in opening safes often run this film as the entertainment portion of their \\"penetration parties\\" where they challenge each other to see who can open sample safes the fastest. While these locksmiths occasionally have a few reservations about the practicality of how the safe in this film was opened, they applaud the inventive, unexpected approach. This is not your usual blowtorch or stethoscope-to-the-dial method. You're guaranteed to be surprised at the kind of assault Robert DeNiro's character devises.    Then there's a great cast with a genuine collaborative chemistry. \\"The Score\\" features three generations of Hollywood's leading leading men - Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, and Edward Norton. Just amassing star power often doesn't work. But here the three play off each other and support each other with both the neatness and the edgy precariousness of one of the isosceles triangles in a house of cards. Edward Norton turns in the sort of dual persona performance that has become his trademark and that he has been called on several more times to deliver as only he can.    There's a smooth-as-bourbon romance that gives an emotional heart to the story. There are some imaginative twists and turns along the way. Then the movie supplies the bonus of striking shots of Montreal, a city whose streets haven't been seen a lot in the movies.    Frank Oz supplies a worthwhile Director's Commentary. I found myself actually looking forward to listening to this disc commentary, rather than facing it as the usual chore I feel obligated to complete. The commentary gave me a chance to watch the movie again.    Oz gives some insights into the techniques he used to achieve the desired impact here. For example, he calls the viewer's attention to the fact that many scenes are played without background music. Yes, that silence does add realism and tension to the crew's treacherous maneuverings.    This is a thoughtful, engrossing film that you lean into with fascination - unlike some of the more recent bank-job and heist films in which the perpetrators go in brutal with guns blazing amid a storm of special effects. By contrast, this is a precise, well-planned job, as satisfying as that subtle click you hear when you finally dial the right combination, and the door to the vault pops open.
1878424505|5.0|After reading the first few pages I knew I would be purchasing more of this book because everyone in the world should read this, or at least everyone I know.  If followed this book could change the world because the ideas are simple and yet it requires a lot of practice and determination.  Practicing any of these agreements can help free the reader from a world of pain and misunderstandings.      The book asks the reader to live impeccably that isn't easy but who doesn't everyone appreciate a person who \\"tells it like it is\\".  Another of the agreements is to not take things personally.  It is liberating to accept that other people's mean actions or harsh words are actually theirs and do not truly speak about me.  There is a lot more but the author says it best.
B0001N9ZKW|5.0|I had this LP when it first came out in 1974 & it was one of my favourite albums. Now I have the CD, I play it all the time & the bonus tracks are great. Without doubt, it's a masterpiece of English folk music, definitely a must-have. If you love Steeleye Span, Fairport Convention, etc., then you can't be without this one!

0553801473|2.0|I just finished the book last night and I was disappointed.  As many, many others have noted the plot just hasn't moved along enough.  It is agonizing to read some of the Daenerys chapters especially, because there are so many peripheral characters in her story arc that I just don't care about.  Just get to Westeros already!!!<br /><br />It was also frustrating to be introduced to a brand new (apparently main) character whose presence we should have heard about in the first couple of chapters of the first book.  In fact, it is hard to believe certain other characters behaved as they did since they apparently knew about the newbie the whole time.  It makes me wonder if Martin is winging it.<br /><br />On the plus side, the characters I do like are still fun to read about even if they aren't doing anything for 800 pages.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Picked this book up after reading his Wheel of Time books. Absolutely great!  Can't wait for the next one.
1936719118|5.0|I highly suggest this book.  While it may only take an hour or so to read it, you will be up for several hours afterwards writing down ideas that the book spurred, rewriting the wisdom that Derek shares, and figuring out how to execute better for you business and life.  It's not all about the money, but a quality of life.  As Derek mentions multiple times, make your business your utopia, follow your path, and execute!
B000N3ST9I|3.0|The Blackening has a few strong memorable riffs. The drumming is creative and the whole band is very solid technically. The singer is not great, although this record sounds better than other Machine Head records I've heard. Overall, a decent record that's good for a few spins but doesn't really leave a lasting impression.
