B004KA9VGA|5.0|I picked this up on a whim, and couldnt put it down. As soon as i had finished it, i was devastated that it was over (so I read it again).  This is one of my most favourite books that has come out in a very long time.  Everything about this book appealed to me, the rhythm, the romance, the magic, the characters.  I cant gush enough, and i am awaiting with great frustration the second book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works just as it claims to. I am using it to remotely control my computer in my classroom. It is great.
0071762345|5.0|Can't say enough about this book - Dave takes you through personal examples of how social media is impacting the world! From a hospitality professional, I learned many things and can truly say this is a book for everyone - not just the social media/marketer! I am really excited to see where Dave & Likeable Media will go in 2012 - sky's the limit with one tweet at a time!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I love the idea of incorporating vintage photographs with the story however I lost interest towards the end. The beginning and middle of the book are real page turners however I found myself not really caring as much towards the end.  I found the plot to be somewhat predictable and the characters left something to be desired. Definetly interesting but not enough so to garner more than three stars.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I really liked this game. It's something like a mystery game where you look for clues and solve little puzzles. Not too hard not too obvious either.  Would be a good game to play by yourself or your kid (I recommend it for 10+). As many others noted, the game is short and it's over in less than an hour.  I still recommend this game.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|This movie was what was expected. Great acting and very well detailed to actual events that would occur. I would highly recommend anyone to watch this movie. At times, if, one is not keeping a close eye, there will be some confusion as to what is going on, so to get the most out of this movie, watch closely.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I just finished reading all three books in this series.  While I recommend all three this one was by far the best and can actually stand on its own. The story is one of my favorite genres in Science Fiction, the dystopian future. This one is uniquely grim as the author imagines a future in which the former United States is controlled by a fascist regime which divides the country into 12 districts, keeps them impovershed and near starvation and forces each district to choose two children to participate in a contest in which only one of the 24 chosen can leave alive.  The story is narrated by one 17 year old girl from district 12 who ends up chosen for the Hunger Games and the book is never dull as she reveals her way of life and then the contest for her survival.  The story moved fast and the characters really came to life as did this horrible world. I highly recommend.
140053271X|5.0|The Nook Simple Touch is a wonderfully engineered e-reader.  I got mine for X-mas and have read a 300 plus page book on it.  The screen is very easy on the eyes. You can read for as long as you like.  The e-ink print is sharp. The tablet is easy to hold. You can turn a page with just a tap of your finger on the screen, or press a side bar. Pages turn instantly. I have wifi, and buying a new book and downloading it is easy. Download time is a matter of seconds. I am using this to read popular fiction and non-fiction.  I don't need a tablet, and my shelf space is limited. Now I don't have to get rid of an old book to shelve a new book. I am a happy (Nook) camper!
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Although this is the microphone that Kodak recommends for their cameras, I find it does not do the best job. The internal microphone does a better job than this one. I found that the Olympus ME51S if far superior for use with the Kodak.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|As the perfectionist that I am, I looked around for a cover for 2 weeks, and decided on this one. It was definitely worth it! Fits perfectly snug, so comfortable to hold while you read. Soft material inside. You can slip your hand in its pocket for more comfort and control. Great quality, not to mention it's a beautiful color and unique design. I get many compliments. There is nothing wrong with this item! I have had it for a while now... and i don't usually write reviews, but I had to recommend this!

B005C9YZIW|5.0|I have seen countless footage of nature and animals related films. This is definitely one of my top 3 all time best. Life is another one you should see. I love the extras which showed how the footages were shot and the views of the photography teams. The best!
B0000524CY|5.0|In my personal opinion, this is the horror film that all others should be judged by. This extended edition is so hardcore that I can't even find anybody who wants to watch it with me, or even borrow it. Seriously. My sister won't even allow it in her house. What else do I have to say to convey to you the sheer intensity of this film? Excellent cinematography, production, direction, script, and acting.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game for kindle fire. easy to use. great graphics. very smooth card sliding. recommend to all spider solitaire lovers.

B00511PTWM|5.0|This product does exactly what its supposed to do. It now powers my gps and radar detector with no problems.
B005AVIZ6U|2.0|I found this Lee Child painful. Two dimensional characters with a laboured and unengaging plot made reading this a chore rather than a pleasure. Having just read - and loved - \\"Worth Dying For\\", I was expecting a similar rush. Instead I got a slow moving \\"whodunnit\\" that within a few chapters had morphed into \\"who cares\\". I suspect if this was a new author's first novel it wouldn't have seen the light of day.
1849514003|5.0|I have been using cocos2d since 2009 and there have been many books that came out about cocos2d. This is the first book that I can claim I bought and really loved. It has wonderful examples that are very relevant to some of the problems you might encounter. The one thing I love the most about this book is it doesn't show you how to use cocos2d. You can find that all out on your own. It dives into topics that matter. Highly recommend it!

B003OF3R0S|5.0|Nightmare is.... a mix of all sorts of negative emotions, but displayed in a way that no one would ever imagine. The song 'Ficton', which was originally titled 'Death' before the tragic departure of their drummer, Jimmy 'The Rev' Sullivan, came to me as foreshadowing. Maybe The Rev knew he was going to die in three days. [Not implying suicide AT ALL. He doesn't seem like the 'suicide' type to me.] Maybe he wanted to give the fans and his band the same effect from the foreshadowing that I sense.  This entire album makes me cry. Ever since Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, I've been an avid follower of Avenged Sevenfold, and I will continue to do so until the day I join the great big concert in the sky. This album not only displayed great darkness, but also great light. They show that, despite the darkness in their lives, they saw the light that helped them get through.  The tracks... Oh my god, the tracks. I cannot listen to this album without shedding a tear, and I think it will be that way for quite some time. Listen to the entire album once through to get a feel for it, then listen to the individual songs until you understand the lyrics. There is so much hidden meaning... I could never describe it. The album is definitely worth every penny.   ~Repo
B004O3YGMC|5.0|from what i've read, it's awesome, but it will not install on my LG Ally.  Not the program's fault. It requires a good phone, and the LG Ally is not any Android user's ally at all.<br /><br />once I trash this cacca-phone, i will be buying this app for sure.
4770031246|5.0|I can't say enough about this book; it's absolutely everything you need to get into making and enjoying bento lunches. I was looking for something alternative to bring in my everyday work lunches and have been a longtime fan of Japanese culture.  I stumbled upon Makiko's blog about a year ago and, after trying several of the recipes she has posted there and being very satisfied with them, I decided to purchase her book.<br /><br />I have never been more satisfied with a cookbook in my 20+ years of cooking!  The recipes are straight forward, easy to follow and incredibly good. What I liked most about this book was that the author kept the Western cook in mind and gave helpful tips throughout the recipes regarding where best to find specific ingredients or, if necessary, the author also tell you how to make or where to buy a substitute. I can't honestly think of one American cookbook that does that well!<br /><br />Another thing that really impressed me is that the author included sections on how to select the right bento box to meet your needs, what accessories (silicone dividers/cups, vegetable cutters, etc.) she found useful, and even takes the time to discuss how to properly prepare your rice. She also includes a really helpful section on food safety and a section on bento meal planning.<br /><br />I have been extremely satisfied with each recipe that I've tried and each one was a truly flavorful, thoughtful pairing of delicious and very attractive food. I really, really liked how each entree was broken down into it's component dishes and how there's a quick but informative write-up of what the dish is (how it tastes, why it's popular/liked in Japan, etc.) paired with the instructions to make that particular component of the entree.<br /><br />Finally, I highly recommend the ginger pork and new potatoes recipe! I loved it so much I quadrupled the recipe and now serve it at home for dinner. My kids devour this dish and ask for seconds! I'm completely \\"converted\\" -no more boring sandwich lunches again for me. In my opinion, there's no greater joy than opening your lunch box to a meal you prepared yourself that looks as beautiful as it is satisfying and nutritious! And this book will help you do it!
B0025UHKNS|2.0|I compare TIMEX GLOBAL TRAINER, GARMIN FORERUNNER 305 and GARMIN FORERUNNER 405CX.   TIMEX GLOBAL TRAINER   GOOD: 1. It is good for triathlon (the other two watches are not because they are not water resistant so that you can swim with them. The other 2 watches are water resistant up to 1 meter and only for a short time (less than 30 minutes)) because it is water resistant and can work in the water too.  BAD: 1. Garmin's have better website features and give more statistics (which are necessary). TIMEX asks you to pay for such features.  2. I was not able to get GPS connection after I run several times (this may be either because my watch is defective or perhaps this is something that could be fixed in some way even though I could not find it out even though I read the whole booklet).  GARMIN FORERUNNER 305 (The best watch for runners)   GOOD: 1. Garmin website features are great(!) and free.   2. It works with buttons - hence it is very easy to work with it while running.   3. Its light also operates with a button -- which is extremely important! (while running)  BAD: 1. It cannot be used as a regular watch.   2. It died after 2 weeks but I asked for replacement -- if the new one dies again I will update my review.  GARMIN FORERUNNER 405CX   GOOD: 1. It can be used as a regular watch even though its color is unusual.   2. Garmin website features are great(!) and free.  BAD: 1. It DOES NOT work with buttons - which renders the watch unusable from the runner while running.   2. Its light also DOES NOT operate with a button(!) -- which is extremely important when you run in the night! (otherwise you cannot use the watch at all).   3. Forerunner 305 has better functionalities-features.   4. The bevel is a very bad choice! It is ok (not great) when you do not run, but when you run it is a very bad idea. If you lock it so that it does not change displays or ring from any hit of my gloves, then you cannot even see the the display (if it is night!).
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|I was nervous about seeing this movie.  This was one of my favorite Saturday Morning Cartoons.  I loved this movie and bought it for my DVD collection.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app is truly how a remote app should work. it can stream anything and really helps if you're away from home
B004O3YGMC|1.0|this is the worst remote desktop app ever. you have to install software on every computer you wish to access. just install rdp lite that is free anytime and you don't need to install extra software on your computer
B006L0A5P8|5.0|I have been using 1password on many platforms. it seamlessly syncs across all devices using dropbox and they have an active user forum for discussions and support .  was delighted to see it working well here on my new kindle fire

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! it is so addicting......on the second page of games...unlock the one on the very bottom left first because it will get you the most points fastest
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Allows you to access all the programs your tablet or phone is unable to, I will use it to fix my girlfriends Pc from my kindle fire. Or better yet access the two terabytes of music and movies stored on my laptop, a nice little work around for the limited memory on my fire. And getting it for free as the amazon app of the day makes it even better, I would of gladly paid the 5bucks they wanted for it knowing what I do know....Bottom line if you have a tablet/phone/whatever and a expensive desktop or laptop sitting at home, why not leverage its power from your mobile device. Just being able to log into my home Pc and email myself something I forgot to transfer makes this a lifesaver.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|A must have for any Harry Potter fan.   Better yet, this movie collection is great for anyone interested in film production, as it has hours of behinds the scenes footage.
1419701533|5.0|My ten-year old daughter received this set for Christmas.  She's a reluctant reader, especially when it comes to chapter books.  She read half a book each day of her Christmas break and couldn't put them down!
B004ULEEY8|4.0|This is yet another movie I went into with low expectations after hearing a lot of negative things about it. To my surprise, this movie was very entertaining. Aaron Eckhart owns this movie, he takes it on his back and carries it through to the finish. The rest of the cast is strong as well, but Eckhart really stuck out for me. Solid, solid cast. The action in this movie, once it starts, is pretty nonstop. You don't really have any time to catch your breathe, its one battle after another. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoyed Independence Day, Black Hawk Down, District 9 and similar movies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app has a variation of fun interactive games. they are not just time consumers either you actually enjoy the multiple choices
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is nothing shy of amazing! It lags just alittle, but it's expected... I would recommend this app to ANYONE! I'm in a high school that uses laptops in every class I have and rather than constantly pulling out my large laptop, I just pull out my kindle fire! Not only do I use this app, but my Pre-AP Chemistry teacher uses this app on her iPad while her Mac is hooked up to the projector so she can interact with her laptop while lecturing!
B0061S073A|5.0|This has worked very well for my four year old on the kindle. Not only does it limit her choices to what we choose the simple ui works for her better than scrolling thru all the apps.
B005HEW7JG|4.0|If you are reading this, you probably already have your own opinion of Star Trek: Voyager. Of all the Star Trek series, this was probably the most \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" series. There has never been any Star Trek that I didn't appreciate, so I liked this series just fine.<br /><br />I own the DVDs of Voyager, and I think they look spectacular. The streaming picture is just OK. It's a bit fuzzy looking, and suffers from the common streaming problem of having movements that sometimes look sluggish. When Amazon first announced the complete Voyager and DS9 series would be available on Prime, I wondered if I should sell my DVD copies while there is still a market for them. After watching a couple of the shows stream, I'm keeping the DVDs.<br /><br />This particular pilot was a very unusual start to a Star Trek series. It has two ships being drawn to a VERY remote point of the galaxy, and then suffering calamities that kill many of both crews. The remaining crew of each ship, nominal enemies, must combine and find a way to live and work together if they wish to have a chance to survive and find a way home. I thoroughly enjoyed this show, its episodes, and its cast.<br /><br />If you don't have the DVDs, I certainly wouldn't want to talk you out of watching the streaming version of this show if you are a Prime member. You just won't be getting anywhere close to its best presentation.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|This sleeve seems well made and looks good. It fits snugly to the Fire, and doesn't add to the size, making it harder to carry around. I do agree with others, however, that it is a little \\"pricey\\" hence the four stars.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Lags behind the iOS version. Rotation lock is missing. Would be nice to have an easy way to control host sound volume. If they added those two features it would be five star. That being said, I'm impressed. Slick interface. Stable. Incredible frame rate and performance.
B004J1DBJI|2.0|I have little interest in physics and math, but the app have not helped with most of my biology related inquires. Pretty unintelligent answers for \\"size of human liver\\" or even \\"major liver vein\\". I am leaving alone anything as complicated as \\"components of ERK\\" etc.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|While the app seems quite nice, it changed the screen resolution of my desktop, so when I stopped running it, the icons had moved all over the place. Made quite a mess!

B004FEFZU2|1.0|Sorry, but this rating is for the outrageous price Amazon is selling this for... $59.95 in the USA (as of the writing of this review).  Just a few weeks ago it was selling for $35.95...WTF???!!!!! My best investment was to purchase a multi-region Oppo brand Blu-ray 3D player... IT PLAYS EVERYTHING!!   So, I bought this SAW FINAL CHAPTER Blu-ray 3D version from the Amazon.co.uk site for £7.00(GBP)... that's about $10.92(USD). The 3D is great!    If you like 3D?  EXPAND YOUR VIEWING/PURCHASE OPTIONS like I did and I'm sure you'll be happy to find other savings like... SANCTUM 3D for £7.99, THE HOLE for £8.99 and, PIRANHA 3D for £4.99 (not the best movie, but for that price...???)
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie!  I owned this previously on VHS and usually fast-forwarded through \\"When Love is Gone\\" so it was nice to have the choice of the shorter theatrical version.  However if you love that song, there is an option that includes it.  I'm hoping to pass on the love of Muppets to my kids.
0307959856|3.0|On occasion James captures the tone very nicely.  Lady Catherine's letter, Charlotte's handling of Mr. Collins and Lidia's behavior all capture the spirit of the original.  But in other ways James is tone deaf and reverts to writing that is simply that of her earlier mysteries. On the whole, after a promising beginning, the book runs down hill into a workman-like product.
B0052U59F4|4.0|BRIEF SUMMARY<br />Anastasia is about to graduate from college when she meets, Christian Grey, for an interview for the campus magazine. With the interview not going so well, she wants to forget the entire experience of the interview, as she finds Christian intimidating. Moving on, Christian shows up to her place of work, thus, starting a tumultuous relationship between both her and Christian.<br /><br />THOUGHTS<br /><br />This story was definitely a roller coaster ride with each character, which made me feel annoyed at times, drained and weary, but oddly enough, I stilled enjoyed it.  The moment both characters met, there was this odd, very intense, and unknown chemistry. Although Ana is twenty one, at times you forget that she was twenty one and at others you remember her maturity level. Being so innocent and getting to know Christian was very telling for her and brought her into his world that she viewed as dark. I have to say, Christian, did annoy me a bit throughout the story, as I viewed him as a jig saw puzzle; he was very hard to figure out. However, I knew that to be apart of his characteristics. I feel if a book personally is affecting you with some form of emotion, then the author achieves what he or she is conveying with either character and what they're feeling. And I think Ana, felt as frustrated as I did trying to understand Christian Grey. Either way, both Ana and Christian meshed well together. It was also exciting seeing Ana journey into the world of BDSM as Christian pushes her further to what he knows.<br /><br />I did enjoy the emails but they felt a bit much at times, and I also enjoyed reading the contract and rules. The author definitely made you feel apart of the story. I fell in love a bit with the secondary characters, Kate, Ana's best friend and Elliot, Christian's brother. Although I know the story isn't about them, I wanted to read more about the characters and relationship.<br /><br />And as for the intimacy level, it was constant, but it was also pleasurable with its kinkiness, along with the things that were done. I viewed Christian and Ana's physical chemistry to be that additional character to the story line. I look forward to the next two installment of this trilogy.<br /><br />Story: FAIR to GOOD<br />Intimacy: D.R.I.P (Don't Read In Public) w/ added SPICE & KINKINESS<br />Enjoyment: GOOD<br /><br />Romance Novel Junkiesess, along with the things that were done.

0891419063|5.0|Not sure of what more to add over most other reviews. If you like this genre of war, and it was something that I was interested in after watching the HBO series PACIFIC, this book brings it together in a whole new light. Sledgehammer's account of the brutality of the Japanese soldier in these battles in par none, and brutal in the highest of senses. Some of his prose is extremely good but simply written, and draws the reader right into the middle of the action.
0316017930|5.0|It's another great work by Malcolm Gladwell.  I find his look at social psychology interesting.  This book is inspiring because it takes a little of the magic away from how Bill Gates, famous musicians, sports players, and more made it to the big time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works beautiful on my Kindle Fire. So far is has ran flawless. Great graphics and I love being able to view the weather stats I want for any place. Great to use when planning for vacations. its even free.

1451627289|4.0|An interesting one this, Mr King's latest doorstop of a book.  It's a time travel story with a gentle love story snuck I while you are not looking.<br /><br />Jake discovers that there is a doorway back into 1958 in his local diner and is convinced to go back in time and change history, stopping the Kennedy assassination.  Trouble is, the doorway only leads to 1958 so Jake is going to have to live back in time for a while until 1963 when Kennedy was assassinated.<br /><br />So it's a nostalgic fish out of water story while Jake finds his feet in the late 50's and early 60's.  And he has to test the time paradox a couple of times to see if he can actually change history.....The trouble is, time is a little resistant to change and there is also a traditional Stephen King sense of menace that prevails.<br /><br />I enjoyed it, the first half was probably better, once Jake starts addressing the Kennedy aspect it got very detailed and slightly lost the human touch of the first half.  But a really interesting book from Mr King, probably his best in a while.  A bit of history, a character driven story, a hint of menace and a time travel story so lots of elements to enjoy.<br /><br />If you liked this I would strongly recommend Replay by Ken Grimwood or, if you want a New York based time travel story, Time and Again by Jack Finney.
B005DZMODI|5.0|Love the New Orleans jazz arrangements.  Even the jazz remake of Layla is good.  A good blend of vocals and instrumentals.
0553386794|2.0|When I read, I read for entertainment.  This entertainment could be cerebral morality tales that make me question the world around me, or just old school adventure that gives me a few hours of escapism.  Game of Thrones has none of that.  I can understand what everyone likes in these books, but I digress.  I had three main problems with this book:<br /><br />1:  While Martin can write stellar characters the rapid POV shifting and incredibly complex plot left me unable to empathize with them or 'get into their head' and feel what it must be like in their shoes.  They came off as emotionally shallow.<br /><br />2:The  different plot threads in this book pass by in a whirlwhind of violence and darkness that left me feeling like I'm watching them unfold from behind a thick glass window, and not in the thick of the action.  Everything moves too fast for me to latch on to and really enjoy.  The world itself is interesting, but underdone.  Martin tries to use Tolkein's style of dropping random details to add depth to his world, but in all the confusion those details are lost<br /><br />3:  Its too dark.  All the characters save maybe Arya and John are either unlikeable, underdeveloped as mentioned in one, or just plain stupid.  I have no reason to invest in them because they're all a bunch of murderous, incestuous psychopaths that I can't be interested in except to hope that they die painfully.  I get it Martin, you want to deconstruct the fantasy genre and show how brutal a real fantasy world would be, but in doing so you've robbed it of its soul.<br /><br />I give this book a star and a half for Arya nd John, but apart from that its just a thousand pages of fire starter.  Fires are more fun anyway.  Nonetheless, I did like the HBO series better and will be following it, that I can recommend to anyone.
0545123267|3.0|As an adult well past my teens, I find myself sometimes looking at teenagers and thinking, \\"I am SO glad I am past all that.\\" - \\"all that\\" being the hormone-driven craziness that seems to prevail during so much of the teenage years. Unfortunately, I found myself thinking that a lot while reading this book as well.<br /><br />The story is not terrible, though it did strike me as VERY similar to a version of Twilight where the main man is the werewolf instead of the vampire. It's an interesting take on the legend of werewolves, but not enough to detract from the heavy dose of teen angst that overflows in the book. It's a tad bit overwhelming, really. I did finish reading the book, though I had no real desire to do so. And as someone who loves to read and always has a backlog of books, a big decision is whether or not to continue on to read available sequels. I will not be reading these sequels - I just didn't feel enough of a connection with the story and the characters to press on when there are so many more options out there.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I was initially reluctant to purchase this system at first.  Having been \\"burned\\" from previously purchased video systems for gaming consoles in the past, I was not ready to gamble on another one.  After reviewing the feedback and support forums for the manufacturer, I decided to take the plunge.  I can say without a doubt that I have no regrets what so ever.  The G155 deserves its ratings and more.  The display is comparable to most similarly priced HD TVs.  The one feature I enjoy the most is the sound quality from this system.  Most of these portable entertainment systems have horrible or diminished sound quality.  Not so with the G155, I currently have my volume set at 35, which is more than adequate for gaming or blu-ray playback.  I haven't bothered to crank it all the way to a 100.  Truth be told I thought I was going to blow my ears out at 60.  One other thing I would note.  While the system is designed for the Xbox360 or the Slim PS3, it can technically also manage the regular fat PS3 as well.  The key is replacing the foam padding that your console is supposed to sit on with a thinner lining.  The G155 comes with a two-sided molded foam padding for either system.  However if you replaced it with a slightly thinner foam lining you can definitely fit the older 20, 40, 60, and 80 GB versions.  As a mobile system I definitely appreciate the hard plastic shell casing.  As a frequent air traveler, I have never had an issue with airport screening.  I didn't even have to take the console out of the casing.    As a side note, I have also been able to use the display as a seperate monitor for my laptop.  **WARNING** In order to do this, you MUST have a laptop with and HDMI out port or use a HDMI DVI/VGA adapter.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very good!!! Very Fast remote pc control over LAN.  Also has WAN support.  Currently I use Team Viewer, but Teamviewer is not as fast via LAN as Splashtop.  Also the setup for Splashtop is very very easy.  BUT WAIT, There's MORE :-)  -  One of the Best features is it will let you play hulu from your Remote PC, and it will play it full screen on phone or tablet with one click AND ports the audio to the device while muting the source computer.  Very nice!!!  I have tested hulu and it works great.  So Hulu Plus is NOT required to watch on your Android Device :-) .  I can't get VLC to push video to the phone yet but will keep trying.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book starts out slow and a bit difficult to get into. Give it time though. I almost gave up and it was almost a terrible mistake. After the first 80-100 pages the book starts to get going. This trilogy far surpasses most of the crime fiction I have ever read. Just give it time and you won't be disappointed!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I recommend this game to people ages 5-99. I love how I can play more then 100 games and it only takes up a little amount of space
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I woke up one morning to this movie and thought it was hilarious, I thought that it would be great for family night, I ordered it maybe 2 weeks before the holidays and it arrived right on time to watch with my family on christmas.....Thanks :)
B000NZD9RS|5.0|This item plays great and sounds great.  It seems to be good quality vinyl (time will tell).  It is definitely worth buying new as opposed to used.
B005Z271Y6|4.0|Very enjoyable DVD from a charming and talented young woman. Beautiful voice, lively interaction with the audience - only wish she had included the song \\"Don't You Remember.\\" Could have listened to another hour of it! Enjoyed the prompt delivery and great price from Amazon.
B004EPYZPS|1.0|A cute, big eyed alien lands in a saucer, befriends children on bicycles, and makes a phone call. It is a very cute British children's film from 1955 called SUPERSONIC SAUCER. It was laughable watching Spielberg remake this film in 1977 as CLOSE ENCOUNTERS (several versions; he strives for perfection, after all) and in 1982 as E.T., not to mention 1987 as *BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED. He continues to remake this British film. It is now vomitous. Are we not lucky to have \\"fresh\\" visions and \\"talented\\" filmmakers among us? Look up at the sky with a stupid expression if you disagree.
B000N4SHPS|4.0|Bought my son-in-law the Rocky series,most of it anyway.Couldn't find Rocky 5,he's got it now.But this movie completed the set and now he has the ENTIRE SERIES! He's happy and now,he can watch them whenever he wants!
1419702238|5.0|My 9 year old son said that this was his favorite Christmas gift!  He loves the whole series, and finished this book in about 2 days.
B001TW68P4|5.0|This group really knew what to sing about back then, every song almost reflects on my life.. I will continue to listen forever..L.W.GEER JR.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Vicious, dishy, clever and downright entertaining to write just a few adjectives to describe the old \\"they don't make movies like they used to\\" cliche.  So there's not a single man in the movie?  Sorry, guys - you are not missed!   The lovely and sweet Mary Haines discovers that her beloved husband, Steven is cheating on her. Back in 1939, women of her social standing didn't have careers other than supervising their households (doesn't hurt if you also have a maid and a cook as Mary did - and thank goodness since her household staff fill us in on all the gossip).  Days were filled with beauty salons, fashion shows and exercising (which consisted of a vibrating belt doing all the work for you as you gossiped with your friends).  Of course gossip is always fun to hear except when you find out you are the subject as Mary discovers when her dimwitted manicurist drops a bombshell on her.   The other woman, Crystal, a sleazy and sexy shopgirl who sells perfume is played to conniving perfection by Joan Crawford.  Does Mary overlook the indiscretion or confront her husband?  While it is very funny, it also gives us a glimpse of how limited women were back at this time and while someone like Mary who had wealth could still \\"live\\" without being married, it reminds us of those other women who had to deal with the same issues but had to stay tied to their men simply because they couldn't survive financially on their own.  While this movie is dated, it still remains surprisingly fresh with wicked and sharp dialogue that doesn't seem to end.  If you've ever enjoyed a Real Housewives (name the city) episode, you will enjoy this 10X as much. Jungle Red!!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|ohmigosh this game is so fun! I play it all of the time and cant resist playing. is the 20 words already?
B005HPY8LU|5.0|I loved Kelly Clarkson's first CD and this one is more like how she started out.  I enjoy listening to her story in song.
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|I purhase this for my daughter. She loves cats. She enjoyed it.  It arrived on time or early. No problem to list.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like the fact you can have multiple alarms with many variations (solving math problems before you can snooze or music that increases until you snooze).
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This was a great TV show so i had to buy it, i only wish they didn't ruin the second season!
B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this as a gift for one of my friend's daughter and it was a big hit.  :-)  She loved it!!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Easily the best remote desktop app out there for the price.  I even &quot;stream&quot; movies from my computer to the Xoom.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy to use and a lot of fun. I like the way the cards move and the selection of cards.
B002ZBTXQY|5.0|This was an MP3 download and it was great to review the songs prior to purchasing the album.  Good one to listen too.  The download was fast easy and simple.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Purchased to use one song for my wedding party entering reception ballroom. Versatile and fun music. Be sure you have the movie on hand though, hearing this will just make you want to watch the whole thing.
B005QVCXM6|5.0|This was an MP3 download and it was great to review the songs prior to purchasing the album.  Good one to listen too.  The download was fast easy and simple.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I'm not one to read. But with this app it reads it to you. It really is perfect.Whoever thought of this I must say thank you. I can get closer to my lord God because of this app.
B005XI94HY|5.0|This was an MP3 download and it was great to review the songs prior to purchasing the album.  Good one to listen too.  The download was fast easy and simple.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It gives you a lot of options. I enjoy most of the games on this game pack. it was worth the download but I did read that you shouldn't upgrade or you lose everything.
B005QPGHQU|5.0|This was an MP3 download and it was great to review the songs prior to purchasing the album.  Good one to listen too.  The download was fast easy and simple.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The Snowman is a visual and auditory delight, giving children the opportunity to express their developing vocabulary as the story unfolds.  I began showing this to my kindergartners when it first came out.  Since retiring, my young grandchildren have enjoyed this wonderful story.
B000TEPEJO|5.0|This was an MP3 download and it was great to review the songs prior to purchasing the album.  Good one to listen too.  The download was fast easy and simple.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I too am surprised by some of the bad reviews of this case.  The case is exactly as it's advertised by Amazon.  The case fits tightly and is extremely light.  The fit and finish is top notch and very durable.  I am very happy with this case and I would highly recommend it is you are looking for a case that does not add much bulk to the Kindle Fire.
B002ZBZNPO|5.0|This was an MP3 download and it was great to review the songs prior to purchasing the album.  Good one to listen too.  The download was fast easy and simple.
0847835073|5.0|This is an amazing collection of photographs.  There are a broad range of settings and both color and b/w pics.  Monica is stunning throughout.  The only quibble I had was there is no index including the year of the pictures.  It would be nice to how how old she was in each shoot.  This is a minor issue.  If you enjoy quality photography BUY THIS BOOK.
B0045MRLCE|5.0|This was an MP3 download and it was great to review the songs prior to purchasing the album.  Good one to listen too.  The download was fast easy and simple. The digital book was great to review also. Nice edition.
B00000DI06|4.0|Beautiful voices in both Requiem and Magnificat bring out the wonderful melodies.  It will have you singing  along and long after.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|hasn't updated since release. freezes after a short time playing on gtablet, galaxy nexus, Droid charge (causes reboot), and many others.  on the upside, it works on an old Droid 2...  sad that companies can sell an app then abandon it...
B002M9WW30|5.0|HA! got this when the price was $40.50.... what a steal! 6 bluray movies for 40.50! That's like 6.75 for each movie.... great deals... it just sucks when Amazon adjusts prices... sometimes they keep dropping them and sometimes they skyrocket
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|I loved this movie up until about half way. Me being a movie collector I of course purchased it, but I was a bit disappointed with it still. It had SO MUCH potential! But still worth it to own, great sci fi flick.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best app for finding out the weather forecasts. The tempetures are almost always accurate and I love being able to see more than one cities weather forecast
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Now Im not exactly a huge stallone fan but this was pretty good. I have to admit hat I was waiting for the headband to come in though. Very good collection of action characters and decent for a low budget film. Good thing about low budget though, limited cg! So lots of actual explosions!
8857206882|5.0|Perfect !!!  Very quick and and the packaging was excellent ! Thanks  The price was interessant and the relation very kind.
B004HO6HWK|4.0|Big fan of statham but sometimes his movies can get.....a little to british to be honest. But this movie, not the case. This was great. It was very transporterish. Full of action, had a good plot, decent cast, all the elements needed for a good action movie. Check this out for sure!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice game!! I love solitaire. Great time waster very awesome graphics easy movement totally addictive!!!!!!!!!! great. from age 0-99 fun fun fun!!!
B0036TGT3E|4.0|This film is such a special piece of history! In my opinion it's the film that started all of the CG craze. Absolutely something thats a must for families and disney lovers. And the picture is also very good considering its age, besides the remaster.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I started playing and could not put it down.  Jeez, I seem to need eleven more words to make twenty.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|This is at the top of my list right now! This movie is just epic, there is no other word to describe it. Every detail of it was perfect, in my opinion. Its one of those movies that keeps you entertained every second! Rob Downey plays that character so well that its hard to think of him any other way! The only thing I did not like about it was when they used Stan Lee as Larry King! I find that to be just insulting really.
B006OT03BM|2.0|As outlined on the official Michael Bay forums, the IMAX edition of ROTF will not be included with this set; link: [...]  Thus, a no-buy for me....guess I'll just get the films individually (and I waited on buying any of the films so I could get a trilogy set).  PS: Please understand that I gave this boxset a 'star rating' only because I had too. Since I don't intend on buying this now, I wouldn't have rated it if I didn't have to.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|It does exactly like it says. It's clear, covers the front glass, and isn't slippery in your hands. I wasn't originally too thrilled with the back design, but I never see it and the grooves are on the inside so I don't feel anything in my hand. I was tired of having this nice phone all \\"boxed up\\" in cases and this clear case shows it off beautifully.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've had my Kindle Fire since the week it came out. While I've downloaded my share of free apps, this is the only one I've been inspired to write a recommendation for. Once you take the time to read directions, it's easy to install. It really is like having my computer pop up on my Fire!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|let the spying begin! lol jk (maybe). I got this because the app was free today and didn't really know what is was, so to those of you confused here it is in a nutshell: this allows you to use and access your computer from your phone or tablet -or just open the app and watch what your kids are doing on your computer from a safe distance away hah!   amazing technology here! thanks for making it free paid app of the day!
B001KX50BK|5.0|This is the best pretty woman dvd out there.I like the orignal theater version which this is. All other Pretty woman dvd's have extra scenes in them
B000X5SPBI|5.0|been a fan of the show since the first season and decided i had to have it in my collection! very happy with my purchase.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|Purchased this cover for my daughters Kindle Fire, expected more from the products because of the pictures on the site.  fully provides protection for the rear of the Kindle, not much for the front, the front cover moves when closed.
B006517W3G|5.0|It's one thing to say. PERFECT ;) If you dont have it an like that music,you must by it ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app it great.....lots to do not many glitches ....the only downfall is some of the apps are kinda difficult
B0000TB03W|5.0|I live in Chicago, but missed this concert to my everlasting regret. She is in top form performing all the hits including UP! album. Her voice is superb and is backed by talented group of musicians. I love this performance and just bought tickets to see her in Las Vegas at Caesar's Palace in December 2012.
B0063GORYU|5.0|good quality. great game. would recommend to anyone that likes spider....also not much lag either.  its kind of easy but what can you say its not supposed to be rocket science
B0054JZC6E|3.0|entertaining. worth a download, but the games are really hard sometimes. overall a pretty decent app with a lot of pretty decent games.
B00486070K|5.0|I could not live without this! The wireless internet always goes down in our office and this allows me to hook up to the cable line with my MacBook Air (which does not have an ethernet connector).
B00376AWFM|5.0|No idea. It was a friggin Christmas present. I've just been trying to stop the constant flow of emails from amazon telling me I have to rate it.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|The Plantronix Pro+ Bluetooth Headset carrying case is great. It is easy to carry, stays closed, protects the headset and is classy. I have not tryed the belt clip yet but am sure it would work fine. I am very happy with the product. It was delivered early and in good condition when received.
B005GVF95O|5.0|I wish it had more puzzles, but my kid doesn't care. He'll redo them. I don't know how long he'll stay interested, but so far so good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't wait to read Mockingjay now! These books are superb, from the full rich character development to the \\"teeth gnawing, edge of your seat\\" action and suspense these books are home runs! Katniss, Peeta, and Gale are all characters that are easy to relate to and easy to love. Though I admit I have a special love for surly Haymitch as well! I can't wait to see how this all plays out, see the evil capitol destroyed, and find out once and for all what is in district thirteen! Thanks for another awesome book Suzanne!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Used it at the bar over wifi. I was able to trade the stock market live on my laptop at home over the internet on my Toshiba thrive tablet. Way cool.
B000001H00|5.0|Milstein and Bach are perfect together. Bach it goes without saying. Milstein's obsession with technical precision, especially tonal, and his marked restraint, are perfect for Bach's playful, ornate, intellectually gargantuan compositions. Milstein helped to resuscitate  the sonatas and partitas for the violin repertoire. He brought the music out into the open, by the force of his celebrity.  For a really engaging and enjoyable listen, buy both Milstein's late recordings of the sonatas and partitas, and the recordings he made towards the beginning of his career, forty years earlier (I think). Milstein had a life-long relationship with this music! And the prices are great!
B005URRCUY|4.0|I almost hate to write a non glowing review, cause I don't want to get lumped in with the whole 'oh they are getting popular now so i have to not like them as much' thing that's so prevalent in 'indie rock.' This IS a great cd, The Black Keys rock, and this cd has a fair share of amazing tracks on it. But there are a few songs that lean a bit too heavy on 'newer' sounds. 'Rubber Factory' just blew me away the first time I heard it, and this just doesn't quite reach those heights. But if you are a fan of these guys, definitely still worth your while. They've worked hard and deserve their success!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a good game to help pass the time. Simple &amp; easy to use. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play a fun, quick game of solitaire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very fun and I would reccommend this to other people that like to play fun games to play this game.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works surprisingly well, even gives me a simple way to stream hulu to my device. Mouse accuracy could be better, but otherwise I'm pleased. Would have paid for this had I known about it before it hit faod.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  It tried very hard to replicated the zaniness of the original and fails badly,,  The writing is poor...with poor puns...and plays on words being used to help the comedy along...The story is too close to the original version, and Zack Galifinakis seemed underutilized,,,being given poor comedic lines and plot opportunities.  I am a fan of Zack...but this was not a good effort from him..his character was largely irrelevant...<br /><br />Teaching a real monkey how to smoke a cigarette..That is supposed to be funny? No.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This product works great!It is now so easy to connect to my computer. This is truly a wonderful product that makes secure connection remotely a reality.
B005IGVYUG|3.0|Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad album.  There's nothing wrong with it.  But the number one reason I am such a big fan of Mr. Waits is because of his wild creativity, his ability to reinvent himself & his sound at the drop of a hat.  Not one song on this album sounded \\"new\\" to me.  What this album sounded like was a collection of B-sides, orphans, & one-offs from his previous albums.  I kept forgetting which album I was listening to, and that it was supposed to be new.  Each song felt as though I had heard it already...when it was on Swordfishtrombones, or Mule Variations, or what have you.  And THAT I find to be terribly disappointing.  Im always up for seeing what Tom's got up his sleeve next, but this time, unfortunately, there's nothing there but the same old arm.
B005TZFYNE|3.0|Bought this for my mom for Christmas based on one song she liked on the radio... oops!!! It's really dirty.
B003L77G6A|4.0|I am disappointed because the disks are scratched and my DVD player will skip once in a while. The show is awesome though!
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|This app does not allow editing of Word or Excel files.  It's a viewer only, and certainly not worth the price.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|love it so cool I love make in those little remarks. it so fun and I use this all the time for fb
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox is amazing. I have 6GB for free and its plenty for me. I use this app on my iPhone and my android tablet. it is just fantastic to have all my important files on hand whenever I want. Best free product on the market.
B000ION23A|5.0|Great video teaches kids a good lesson and it's wildly entertaining! From the animation style to the voice actors you'll be laughing and thinking through the whole movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|[[ASIN:B00006CXSS Band of BrothersThis item is something by son wanted for Christmas and it came in an appropriate manner of time.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Great movie! Worth the price and both the young and old will love it! Is has an amazing marriage of computer generated and hand drawn imagery. The story is stellar and the characters will have you engaged from start to finish.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Great movie, my grandkids have seen this movie about 10 times, and I bought them this so they can enjoy it at their house.  I hope to one day take them to Australia to see the actual place, this is what my grandkids want to do.  Recommend to all a wonderful family film.
B00005JNS0|4.0|Not of Disney's best but very enjoyable. I love the traditional hand drawn animation but this movie has a charm of it's own that can not be denied and you'll find your self smiling and enjoying the story.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I just installed this on my kindle fire, it took me a little bit to figure out how to get it working, but it works great, kind of like having a remote mouse on the fire and a camera viewing my desktop, I was able to run, view and use anything on my desktop off of the fire. I don't know how much I will use it right now, but I can see this feature coming in handy at times.
038572179X|1.0|I've made it to page 80 but am giving up.  I only stuck with the book this long because I kept thinking it was going to get better, based on the 3 pages of rave reviews on the first few pages.  But, it's just too slow and dull for me and I have too many other good books to read.  I am mystified how 500+ people have given this book 5 stars?
B0061JPYX2|5.0|this album is amazing..i can enjoy my days off, and relax to this cd on the weekends!!!!! The tone of the album is really mellow and tranquil.. She will definitely be missed :-) R.I.P. Amy Winehouse
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this daily and it is very user friendly. I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. The reading plans are very helpful too.
B0055CJ8T2|3.0|This album was definitely not what I expected from Kelly. I love it!!! Her songs are real energetic and exciting. I enjoy listening to it while on my way to work everyday!!!!!
B004JK61K0|3.0|I had installed K9 on my GoogleTV and KindleFire and love the app a lot.  I noticed that when I delete emails from my Kindle, it will not delete any mail from my gmail.  I checked all the settings and still didn't work.  I asked a friend to check it out and he installed it on his tablet.  Same thing.  Overall it's a great app, but the feature that it doesn't delete your mail as it's supposed to do, sucks. Most cases I'll have to delete it twice, one from Kindle and then when I log into my gmail.
1410445224|5.0|they delivered it well, its in perfect condition when i got this book. I love reading it before i go to bed, Jobs is a  legend who has the incredible creativity, just cant wait to read wat happened in his life
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun it be good for kids there's lots and lots of fun games your kids should get it
B0034G4OWW|3.0|After seeing a trailer for this movie I thought it would be really funny and cute. I was a little disappointed in the actual movie. It has some cute scenes, but overall it was less funny than I hoped for. I still enjoyed it though.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|games tend to slow down and not keep up so to speak.. but other than that, its a really fun app to kill time
B0050DZN4K|5.0|After a misfire with an earlier release, feedly is an indispensable app. Fast browsing and intuitive interface. A very nice news reader.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The Ka-Bar Becker BK2 is a big, thick blade that feels very formidable in the hand.  I would trust this knife to lead me through many tough tasks whether it be in the jungles of Venezuela or the back streets of Detroit city.  Blade Length: 5.25in.  Overall Length: 10.50in.  Steel thickness: .250in.  weight: approx: over 500g  Sheath: Kydex  First impression out of the box was amazed. Weight and thickness was more than expected yet not to much. The knife has a great feel in the hand - it sits firmly with no slippage.  The sheath is very comfortable with a lot of mounting options. The weight is very easy to carry/manage.  It chops through seasoned hard woods with ease.  This is my first BK knife but based on this experience, I suspect I will be adding the BK9 to my collection as well.
145551389X|5.0|This book is a collection of wonderful photographs that give you a glance into Lady Gaga's life on the road.  Got this as a gift for someone and it was hard to give it away.  I look forward to the next volume.
B001E25MBK|5.0|Timely delivery.  Outstanding product. Happy recipient. Satisfied customer. I would highly recommend this vendor to anyone looking for a video product.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is so cool! Got it for my kindle fire and its amazing! So easy to use and instead of a noise you don't like you can use your own music.
B0055S348W|3.0|Would be nice if my Kodak ESP 5200 was able to work with it.  It looks like a very nice app other then that.
0307593525|5.0|Bought this for my niece who has started in the cooking mode.  She is enjoying going thru these books for recipes and tips.  Great purchase.  Bon Appetit!
B0061S073A|5.0|This app makes the kindle fire safe for my 2 year old to use. She can access the apps I have chosen for her independently. I don't even have to worry about her making on in-app purchases or selecting an ad in the ad supported apps. Great options.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is simply amazing! Multiple translations, easy to take notes and highlight passages. So many good features well worth it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was skeptically upon first seeing this app. but not only does it work, it works very well on my kindle fire. I'm now able to access my itunes library or anything else on my Pc with ease. I cant overstate how happy I am with that feature alone. great app.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|It took him four years, but the doctor has finally met a companion who is as gung-ho as he is. It is quite a change and rather refreshing. After giving a blonde and a black a chance, why not a redhead? As much as Donna wants to be with him, it's interesting how emphatically she denies they are a couple. \\"Not ever.\\" It's tragic irony and a shame to see the season end with her mind wiped of all trace of the Doctor. But in this series, the writers could find a way to bring them together again if they really wanted.
B004HO6I4M|2.0|I was not particularly crazy about this movie. We watched it on family movie night and I honestly went to sleep. I know why I never went to the theater to see this.  Now if only I could get my money back from having purchased it over the holidays.  I just think it was a corny plot and very predictable.  My kids enjoyed, but I don't let them watch it much because I don't like the that big guy in the chicken costume.  The music was OK though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have a Coby Kyros mid8120...this game works great.  I love solitaire games and this is one of the better running apps.
B0063IH60K|4.0|too many ads with free version but fun to play anyway. what else can you say but play anyway. play play play.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|As a person who has a monumental difficulty getting up in the morning, this app is exactly what I was looking for to help me out. Out has so many customizable options anyone could tailor it just to their needs. Thanks so much for this valuable free alarm.
B000002HPV|5.0|One of the greatest albums ever recorded. Also a perfect introduction to Bjorks lovely music- to me all her albums are beautiful.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love how you can tap a card and it will automatically go where you want it. Also starting with a &quot;winning deal&quot; means not wasting time on a losing hand.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A classic! Great game. I play it whenever I need time to pass quickly...entertaining too! I highly recommended this game to everyone. Download it now.
B001NFNFNU|2.0|What a shame.  They took a really interesting true story and made a lousy movie out of it.  By the end of this disappointing film I was so tired of seeing Angelina Jolie in that hat pulled down over her eyes.  It's really hard to judge her acting by seeing only her mouth, but in this case, I guess it really doesn't matter.  It's not even worth the $3.88 they're charging for it today.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is an excellent resource!  I love the different reading plans, translations, facebook integration and ease of use.  I've used it successfully on a Blackberry, iPhone, PC and Kindle Fire with no problems.  Highly recommended!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|instructions for some games would be nice cant quite seem to figure some of them out. only 4 stars because of that
B003VANOFY|5.0|good quality headphones 7.1!!! quality surround sound above all praises, all you can customize yourself, and please friends funny voices
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game but to buy games with points seems odd. the controls are also kind of hard. overall its pretty fun though.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games were a little boring, but at least it was something I could do to kill time. once the first two sets were unlocked and completed, you to keep playing to get points to unlock the rest.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game it is awesome and beast my high score is 200 something what is ur score probally higher then mine hahaha
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it looks like a good game just got it yesterday not the best graphics but a Good game that takes time to bbeat. thanks but better graphics if an update is coming
0062101897|5.0|(I'm not from a English speaking country, so please forgive me for any grammar mistakes in this review.)<br /><br />If you're in love with the Harry Potter books and films you have to buy this book! But only if you love both. If you love the books, but are not really into the movies, then you might not like this book as much as I did.<br /><br />Page to Screen explains everything about every step the moviemakers had to make on the way from the books to the movies. From the making of the death eathers masks, via Buckbeaks, the Snitch and the first drawings of the dresses for the Yule ball all the way to the making of Diagon Alley and even amazing photos of Hogwarts, you'll find everything in this book. You can take a look backstage from filmmaking and read about difficulties, mistakes and all the details in the films of Harry Potter.<br />The book is worth every penny of the price, because the quality of the book, the pages and the photos are amazing.<br /><br />I don't think I can explain the feeling that I had when I got the book in words. I think I stood there at my door with my mouth open for minutes and minutes just turning over page after page looking at the first photos from Dan, Emma en Rupert, photos made during the filmingproces, all those drawings from brooms, books and locations. All those photos were amazingly precise and beautiful.<br /><br />a true Potterfan really must have this awesome encyclopaedia standing next to all the Harry Potter books in his/her bookcase!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I bought this app from the market months ago. it's ease of use and reliability bake this app a must have for anyone with multiple computers. if you ever needed to access your pc remotely, this is the one app to have
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it because it is a race between me and my sister to see who gets more points and games
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok exspecially when you  have nothing nothing else to do. games are ones I have never seen before some are easier to check off then some and others u might need to actually read the directions
B0066W1AZK|5.0|the app is grt! I would readily pay for it.  makes me want to try more from the developer. looks perfect on the kindle fire.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|I am new to the PS3, I have been playing PC games for years. I picked up a PS3 for easy of playing with friends from out of town and found that I hated playing FPS with a controler. I read the reviews about this one and decided that for the money this would be the best one. I was not wrong. The setup is a little hard but if you read the directions FIRST it would help. After following the directions the setup was easier and it works great. Now it is just like the good old keyboard that I am use to.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is flatout awesome!! fun games but you have to use the coins you earn to buy the games.  you don't use actual money so don't freak out!!!! but it takes a long time to.build up coins!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great game of. classic solitaire.  the auto game complete feature after it is clear you ha Ewing. is a nice feature.  now I can completely tune my family out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is FUN! All the games are different. If you don't like a game you just move on. The only things its hard to get coins and so easy to spend them. :)
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I really wanted to like Drive. The trailers had me super excited, I was expecting a white-knuckle action film that would have enticing thrills. The movie was given a 92% and \\"certified fresh\\" on rottentomatoes.com with critic soundbites as, \\"It's a film that has its finger on the pulse of what's current and in style, and one that has solidified its place as the coolest film of the year.\\" and \\"One of this year's most original, entertaining and frankly shocking American movies.\\"  I went into it and was bored out of my freaking mind (blah blah Michael Bay attention span). I was turned off by the awkwardness and somewhat mental retardation of Gosling's character. I saw hardly any sentiment or substance. Any scene featuring Gosling and Mulligan was a chore to watch. So much so that all I wanted to do was stand up in the theater and shout JUST KISS ALREADY! and at least it would do something. Starring blankly at each other for a minute and half with NOTHING to convey their emotions is not art, and pretentious for someone to say that \\"I didn't get it\\".
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this ap!  plays smooth with no bugs! would recommend using it! one of the best free ape I have gotten!
1439181780|5.0|I found this book extremely outstanding. What a extraordinary way to begin the new year. Rhonda gives many insights on how to live an amazing life. Looking forward to Rhonda's  next book.
082300659X|5.0|Great info for drawings, it contains step by step for people who are interested in art to learn the concept in an easy way.
1612680011|5.0|This book really changed my views on how society and myself are. This is a must read book! I've just purchased Kiyosaki's Cashflow Quadrant book too so I'm looking forward in reading that as well!
B004GXKBFQ|4.0|One of the better Peter Pan films, quick turn around as well.  I would recommend this to anyone. Buy it today!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Connecting over my work or home network was a breeze.  Still trying to figure out how to control my pc over the internet.  At home I remotely control my media via the Samsung tab and my phone.  At work, I leave a projector connected to my laptop and walk around the room with my tablet controlling the presentation.  The possiblilities are endless.
B00425S1H8|5.0|The adapter arrived quickly, well packed and was exactly as depicted. It works fine and will be quite useful for my husband to connect his scuba dive computer to his PC. Thanks for a great product!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's a good app if you're looking for some thing fun to do while waiting or you're just bored lol.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|only a few games at first. but then with your points can get more of the 101 games. great on my kindle fire! very ready to get around
B00028HBKC|5.0|I just wanted to say thay this movie was great.It was pretty graphic but it told the storey the way it really was.It brought tears to my eyes that Christ went through so much to save us sinners so we could be free.  Also Amazons service was great I got my DVD very quickly!
B005QN3ANK|5.0|One of the stronger current works in the market now.<br /><br />Consistently, a quality album from Aqua just like the earlier albums. The tongue in cheek writing is not gone. Love it
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The nation has made great strides since the 60s, but this is still a story that needs to be told and remembered.  It is an excellent DVD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good good good gooooooooood gooood good good good I am just doing this to get points so yeah it is good
0553328255|4.0|I greatly enjoyed reading the short stories of Sherlock Holmes on the kindle. Although I wish that there was a table of contents and that the publishers would have more carefully reviewed each word in the book because there are numorous typos. All in all though it has been an enjoyable reading experiance.
B006PKQQJS|4.0|even though this is 1.00, this game is so addicting! I love this game! it is just so much fun! most people just get the free games because they r, well, free but I have to admit, all the paid games I have r the best games on my kindle fire. this game is one of them. definetley get this game! o totally recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's not that bad of an app. it has a lot of games but you have to unlock the game to play it. that's not horrible but it kinda shuns players who want yo play a quick game or two.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|gggrrrr...I cant pass a level. stupid pigs! why cant they all just die? although, it is fun. I love it! its just so addicting! I could play it fer hours if I wanted to, but after a while I feel sick.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Well done, this app has smooth clean action and a crisp look. I like the range of options for appearance, scoring,  and play. I'll be shopping for MobilityWare apps in the future.
0805091742|4.0|This is an excellent book that has application for all of us.  Purchased a copy for a friend who is a big believer in checklists and one for our family.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this game kills some down time, if you have some like I. ive enjoyed it!! maybe you will too! a
B00447G29S|3.0|I own the blu ray movie I do love this movie and so does my grandchildren.But it was a big disapointment.I was so excited to see it in 3d it was not 3d.I do not recomend this in 3d.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun and it keeps you so occupied because there r so many games to pick from!!!!! plus you have to earn the games which makes it so much funner!!!!!!!!!!
B006C1DH92|5.0|This game is very addictive. My husband thinks I play this game just to here the voice of Puss in Boots.......well maybe.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|I do share some concerns other reviews have about the security and proprietary nature of the application and PC-based server.  If all my keystrokes and data are being passed through their own server, I would like to know how secure it is and what steps are taken to protect my data.<br /><br />Interaction with a home PC is passable on slow 3G service, but don't expect buttery smooth video playback.  Or in my case, anything other than a poorly-timed slideshow!  Audio is better but the quality is poor when it's transcoded for 3G.  Connecting over fast wifi, I still can't get video to play right but audio works very well.<br /><br />I had a lot of trouble because I'd lost access to Streamer when off my home network.  Turns out it was due to me turning on Google 2 step authentication.  You have to generate custom passwords for both the PC program AND the Android application!  After that, I was able to get back on while on 3G.  Yay!<br /><br />Update (10/2012) - couldn't get access again while on the road.  So far I'm striking out for ever getting to use this while out of the home.  This time it FINALLY allowed me to sign up for a Splashtop account (previously it wouldn't let me because I didn't have version 2.0, which was not available.)  I never purposely upgraded the product and never received any kind of mailing stating that I HAD to sign up, so this was another strike against it for locking me out when I actually needed to use it.<br /><br />Finally, as if all this B.S. wasn't headache enough, it seems many public wifi spots and hotels block the ports this uses, rendering it again useless in many situations.  Since it works so poorly on 3G (EVDO Rev 0 & A) I'm resigning this to the scrapheap of apps that didn't live up to their promise.  Maybe I'll try again when I'm on a new, faster phone on an LTE network, if one ever gets built here.
1401216676|5.0|What can I say about The Killing Joke that hasn't been said by countless people already? It's an amazing piece of fiction, that tells a fleshed out origin story in a context that is absolutely fitting for the joker. Lore about his states that his consciousness but being akin to have 100 tv's on at the same time with different channels at max volume, but this story considers that the joker is really connected to his past, not disillusioned with life at all. It's a sad story, but fitting.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app works great on droid 2!  keyboad and arrow keys work too!! I don't usually rate apps, but this one deserved a 5 star!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This works surprisingly well on my tiny Mytouch phone. the only thing i wish it had was a button to where you can copy the file straight from the computer and if you could some how connect to you pc with just your 4g signal. i found a work around for the copying files though by using Dropbox. If I forget something, i just log onto my pc, copy the file, and paste it in my drop box folder. Then open the dropbox app and boom, instant file. ANY file.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game. having a blast playing it. which is what playing games should be about. I would recommend to anyone.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Just exactly what i was looking for. Just lijr having your pc in your tablet. I played all my media, used my apps, and played my games.  I had full access to all my peripherals. And it was the free app of the day! It pays to look each day! LOVE IT!
B000006YCU|5.0|Great album, Charlie Dominici is amazing. This album is a MUST HAVE for anyones collection. Its too bad none of Dream Theater's members (former or current) get a penny of the sales for this album.
B005V20JKI|4.0|all I wanna say is what the heck amazon where's the update I would give 5 stars but taking one away because amazon is always many weeks behind the market
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Like a lot of people I found about Brandon Sanderson because he was finishing up the late Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Since then I've read a lot of Sanderson's other books and he really is quite good.   The Way of Kings is easily his best book so far. His writing really reaches a new level in this book. I've really become attached to the characters and the world. Sanderson is always very creative in his books,coming up with new magical systems and unique settings compared to a lot fantasy novels which I often find very run of the mill. The depth of the characters, setting, and again the use of interesting magic sytem in this book is wonderful. Generally I would give Sanderson's work, other than the last book of the Mistborn trilogy only 3.5-4 stars. This is worthy of 5 stars.   If you like epic fantasy and enjoy the in depth writing style of other authors like Rothfuss, Jordan, Robin Hobb, or GRRM you will like this. By referencing those other authors I'm not talking about the themes/tones/ideas in their stories but rather their above average abilities as a fantasy writer. I think a lot of novels, though good, pale in comparison due to the writing abilities of these authors. The only downfall of this series is that only 1 book out of a potential 10 is out. I check Sanderson's blog every so often because I'm really looking forward to the next one!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game entarins my children and they love it some people cant afford. a lot of games. but nevertheless has 117 games in one
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are easy and fun , the app makes it possible to play many different gamed at once but some games are a little slow
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Wow! Easy to install and use. If you know how to follow instructions you can use this app with ease. It's fun and useful.
B0063IH60K|5.0|free and fun!  I have had no issues at all with this app.  I give it 5 stars!  Get it if you love solitaire!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|great on mmy kindle fire and can not believe it was free. though the game does get boring after playing it for a while.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Fun, animated, hilarious and touching-Rio is a movie you'll never forget.  It starts with Blu.  Blu is very rare macaw living in America.  He's never been to his home land after birth, he's never really seen other birds and that's right-he doesn't even know how to fly.  When a renowned ornithologist asks that Blu be brought to Brazil to repopulate his kind with the last female, his owner is very hesitant.  Finally, she agrees and Blu finds himself in a whole new world.  But Jewel, his female counterpart is not exactly what he expected.  And the two of them don't exactly see eye to eye.  When they are suddenly snatched up in the middle of the night-they have to work together to get back.  It's one wild adventure after another as Blu finds himself doing things he never imagined he would.  The movie was a lot better than I think any of us expected.  It had good moral while not being boring.  It was touching and I enjoyed it and so did the kids-this truly is a movie for all ages.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are nice but some of them are hard.I personally think that the app is very neat.I like it.
0679411585|4.0|Harold Moore and Joe Galloway were participants in the fierce battle at Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley of South Vietnam in November, 1965. Galloway was a United Press journalist, but he was no less a participant for that: he carried a rifle (against the rules) and he was in the midst of the X-Ray fighting. Moore commanded the First Battalion, Seventh Cavalry(Airmobile), and he too was on the scene (not, as some readers might expect, in some distant headquarters).  Moore and Galloway spent ten years on this book, corresponding with and interviewing not only American survivors of X-Ray and its bloody continuation at LZ Albany, but three North Vietnamese commanders as well, one of whom stated without exaggeration that the Americans had \\"fought valiantly.\\"  Both sides were terribly mauled, particularly the North Vietnamese (whose losses by their own admission were triple those of the Americans), and it says something about the nature of combat in Vietnam that both sides claimed victory in a tactically inconclusive operation. Moore and Galloway understandably focus on the American side, in the eyewitness style pioneered by S. L. A. Marshall and carried on by writers like Cornelius Ryan and Keith Nolan.    Moore and Galloway seem to want to tell every story about every GI. For the general reader, this makes for a long and somewhat repetitive account. That's unfortunate, because the piling on of detail tends after a while to desensitize the reader to what's happening. Nevertheless, the concrete descriptions of close combat in the fog of war are shocking and heartbreaking enough.  Few readers will wish they'd been in the Ia Drang Valley.   Unusually for a combat narrative, a later chapter describes how the wives and families of some of the men killed learned about and dealt with their loss.    There's no flag-waving here, no rhetoric, fake melodrama, self-glorification,  politics, or sugar-coating. Certainly \\"We were Soldiers Once\\" is essential reading for anyoneinterested in the military aspects of the Vietnam War.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's Star Wars, video is great, sound is great, extras are cool. Just get over it. Seriously. If you want the original releases then you already have them or you can get them. If you want the HD releases then this is what's available, if you don't like it then forget about it, take on pottery or something, geez just get a life.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app.is far superior to the other fee weather apps. I really like the information it provides, especially the maps and radar. I highly recommend this to everyone!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good game to play on my fire.  I have spent many hour wasting time playing it.  Download and enjoy!
B002ZG9846|5.0|great movie alot of action . didnt think this movie would be any good but i was wrong. this is a must see  or must have
0307891372|5.0|These kind of games cost me so much time!!  But, I have to say that having a game guide like this is so nice.  It provides a little information or a lot, depending on what you need.  And, finally, a comprehensive index so you can find information on the quest, location, character, etc.  This is the best, most comprehensive game guide I have ever purchased.  I want to emphasize that you can get thru the game just fine without this game guide but, with the game guide, you see and find so much more.  I would easily have missed 25% of the content without the game guide.
0307891372|5.0|This product has become invaluable to the player of the game. Please with the speed we received this and the condition of the product, mailed so the item was not damaged. Price was excellent. Thank you, it was a very welcomed Christmas gift!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never fails! I never expected the ending of this book to grab me like it did. The entire book was phenomenal but the ending just made it the complete 5 stars. I find myself wishing he would write faster because I can't get enough of his novels! Job well done.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The merit of Walt Disney's \\"The Little Mermaid\\" as satisfying family entertainment is addressed more than enough times in the other reviews and does not require any more elaboration.  But let's face it, the story Disney is actually telling is a far cry from the original one written by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. The actual story for children is very rich in symbolism and meaning and pathos.  I certainly hope that the original story is not forgotten.  It is noteworthy to bring attention to the two marvelous extras on the second disk of this offering by Walt Disney. One is a breathtaking version of \\"The Little Match Girl\\" which is scrupulously faithful to the original story.  The second extra is titled \\"The Story behind the Story\\" which not only relates some of the biography of Hans Christian Andersen himself but also the genesis of the actual Disney film through its history.  As it turned out,  Walt Disney had contemplated making a more faithful version of the story in an animated film and had commissioned some absolutely marvelous artwork by Kay Nielsen - which matches the story to its very details. (This outstanding illustrator is not so well known in this country...so I hope these sketches reach a wide audience).  Both these extras are worth the price of the disk in and of itself, particularly for purists.  (And readers, of course)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it, my favorite so far is the sushi game. A fun game when you have nothing else to do.
0756404738|4.0|It seemed to me that this book was a long time in coming, but I enjoyed the first volume of the series, so I wanted to read it. Kvothe continues his many adventures in this sequel, but much of the action takes place away from school which was a welcome change.  The new settings and situations he stumbled into were unexpected and really expanded his world. I remain very intrigued by the character named Bast and look forward to learning more of him in the third volume that I assume is in the works. Kvothe is an easy hero to like, and so is this fantasy series.<br />Michael Travis Jasper, author of the novel \\"To Be Chosen\\"<br />[[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]]
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you just need to kill some time, this app is the perfect solution. The play is classic solitaire and the functionality is very good.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Not a bad idea but poor controls and way too many ads lead to a lot of frustration for me. Lasted about 5 minutes before i uninstalled
B004O3YGMC|5.0|THIS APP IS AWESOME AND WORKS WELL.  IM SO GLAD BOUGHT THE KINDLE Fire. It is so easy to use this remote app and it works fast.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good app. addicting. fun. challenging games. lots of.l variety. amazing. amazing. amazing. I hope there are more apps like this in the future
B001NLKT60|4.0|While I enjoyed the first book, I think this book was an improvement.  Worth taking the time to read if you don't mind graphic content.
B0058VW36U|1.0|for some reason it wont download to my kindle fire. please fix this I would really love to give this five stars so affix this problem
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far...the game is good.  I like the various games and the challenge to open up new games.  Great to pass the time.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case fit my iphone 4s from at&t perfectly  The case is snug, but won't frustrate you should you ever attempt to remove it months or years down the road. The screen protector is a pain to apply properly, but other than that is perfectly adequate.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun and easy to gain points for other games. worth the download for sure. wish I could just buy all the games in a package.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I keep all of my information in Evernote across Android, iOS, and OS X. This implementation is good. A must for existing users, and worth a shot for anyone looking for a new way to organize your stuff/life.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|what a blast playing all the different games in this app. gives me the chance to experience many games I. might otherwise over look.  i don't mind the ads.  this is good clean fun!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|So far, the after one day, I am in love. The program was easy to install on both my tablet and my computer. After I put it on my computer, the program started working immediately.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This challenging puzzle game is a lot of fun and well worth $1. If your questioning getting this game, you really should!
B006B9WGG0|5.0|Blu ray is fantastic. I am not a big fan, just got plenty of concerts to have them playing while entertaining friends. This has great picture and audio quality. And it is good fun, so works very nicely as ice breaker. Just like the other reviews, even though I love Amazon, this price stinks. I purchased the same blu ray at Best Buy for $23. Go for it!
0684857219|5.0|I think this is one of the best orders I have ever placed on Amazon, the seller truly does sell amazing books. I bought this book used and received a virtually brand new book. Since I am an art student, this has been perfect for studying exaggerated anatomy; not to mention all the great high quality photos and lessons that Arnold provides! Incredible book with a great price, definitely a buy!
B000HL09SA|5.0|This is a really sweet family movie that chronicles a boy's coming of age. His dog Skip helps him through the process. Good luck watching this movie without at least a few tears.
B001THZAAI|5.0|I watched this movie in Germany with some classmates, and I really enjoyed it!  For one of my first memorable French films I found it to be really funny and entertaining.  If I were to watch a foreign film other than German, I am usually more interested in the Eastern European and Asian video world; But lately I have been watching more western movies and seeing this movie on the side bar brought back a lot of fun memories.  I highly recommend this movie for a good laugh with some friends.
B0063IH60K|5.0|uninstalled a few others in favor of this one. this developer seems to put out good product. nice app. it's definitely worth downloading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some great games with a few surprises along the way with unlock able games. good on the go. good for kids and adults alike.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|You can buy this direct from Lego for $399.99 every day or walk into LegoLand and get it for that price. These Amazon sellers are ripoff artists.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great! that's all I really can say. so many games u never get bored. always new expeiriences and everlasting fun
B005LLSLPE|5.0|I just kept thinking watching this season that they really 'went there' this season. VERY shocking things happpened. It took a few episodes and I do agree the season finale wasn't as satisfying as I hoped it would be, but still gave it five stars cause this season was the most drama packed, and easiest to understand, by far.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was wonderful.  I am a huge Avett Brothers fan and was excited to hear that there were lots of their quotes in the book.  Knowing all those songs added another level to an already intriguing story.  I couldn't stop reading once I started.  I would definitely read another book by this author should she write another!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its an okay app but its hard to understand the point system. other than that its pretty cool. its like having an arcade all to yourself
B004ZG5F0K|5.0|This product was received as promised and without and scratches or blemishes. This is such a moving story and a few family members had not seen this movie so I thought it worthwhile to purchase. Great movie! Thanks for allowing our family to share the moment of this DVD!
B004O3YGMC|3.0|amazon please improve to wake up home Pc from sleep- limits usefulness if computer needs to be fully on - would like to use app while away from home
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Hopefully you will find a translation or two that you like that has the download option available. The first thing to do is setup an online account via your pc, this will allow you to download the whole Bible translation (not all translations are available. for downloading). It is always quicker for me to setup accounts like this via a regular keyboard and screen. Pinch and zoom would make this perfect. The map options (needs wi-fi) also have format issues on the Kindle Fire. Navigation is pretty good, but bookmarks need to be improved (loneliness access required to see). Usefully if you have a downloaded translation available, but the really great features require you to maintain Internet access.
1451627289|5.0|I listened to this on Audiobook. It was amazing. I would get home from work and sit in my car just to keep listening. I don't know how to explain how great this book was. I literally feel like a chapter in my life is over now that I'm finished with it. You feel SO close to the characters and they are so well developed you hurt with them, laugh with them, cry often and feel every moment as the minutes count down to the climax of the book. It is amazing. By far the BEST Stephen King book I have EVER read. I don't know how he will follow this one up. I have never been a big Stephen King fan, but this book has literally changed my life. It is amazing. Good luck stopping because you eat, breathe, sleep, walk, work, etc. George Amberson/Jake Epping.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|From a 6 year old: It's lots and lots of fun. It lights up and that makes it cool. It doesn't cheat either. It works perfectly.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This works as well as windows remote desktop. Can watch video with sound.  Even over G wifi.  Would have expectedprogram to cost much more.  Can switch users on remote Pc and reconnect without a hitch.  This is areally cool program.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I purchased this game Christmas day. It worked that day. When I tried to log in the next day I got the &quot;New version&quot; bug and I haven't been able to log on since. Per customer service I have uninstalled the ap, deleted the game folder and reset my Kindle Fire back to defaults and then reinstalled the ap multiple times, most recently this morning. It still isn't working.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in both the game and the customer service which keeps sending me the same email instructions over and over, even when I tell them it isn't working.
B005J29HCQ|4.0|This is a very good album to say the least.  However I actually like Brian's \\"Lucky Old Sun\\" a little more of which I gave 5 stars.  This could have had a little more punch (it gets a little boring).  Of course it is what it is and Beach Boy fans will enjoy it.  This would not have sold well if it came out in the 1960's.  All of the hype over time has made it a true collector's item of which many folks have bootlegs anyway.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|This is a great addition to my Xbox I received for Christmas because all I play is dance games and my apartment living room was just big enough for it to work ok, but occasionally I'd bump into the wall where a neighbor is on the other side.  I read other reviews and remembered to move the Kinect to just above my TV since it was mounted at 6ft, now it's at 4ft. Re-calibrated the Kinect, then started to play a dance game.  I was able to stand in the middle of my living room giving me tons of extra space.  No more bumping into the wall so the Kinect could see my feet.  So far no issues and happy with my purchase!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|A must have app if you want to access ur Pc or laptop remotely. Its simple.and works great, I'm able to.control my Pc through my kindle while sitting on the sofa!
B001E45XT4|4.0|Games with this head set sound good, but if your like me and like to blast you music from time to time this is not the headset for you then because this headset even on max is not that loud. It cancels some of the external sound but not all. As for comfort I wear glass and can easily play for hours with this headset and even if you are a metal head and head bang with this headset it stays on pretty well. All in all im happy with it and people complain that the mic goes out well this product comes with a 1 year warrenty.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a good app I think you should get it. it has so many fun games to play. its amazing
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is my first review ever because this is the best app for me.  It follows me from computer to phone and now to my Fire. No more paper notes anywhere.  No more notebook. Keep up the good work.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|If you loved the first game, you'll love this one too. The gameplay is just as fluid as the first, with some new twists (poison raindrops, multiple raindrops, etc). Music is wonderful as always. This is a fantastic game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|keeps me busy when I get bored with the other apps that I have downloaded.  makes me nostalgic for pong in a weird sort of way.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have enjoyed playing these games. you earn points to open more games. all together a great game. works great on kindle.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great game. I really enjoy playing the game to help me pass time. I do wish I could change my card background.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games, especially because they are free! some are difficult to complete though but I enjoy them! thanks!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app is very useful and works well on KF.  I would reccomend this to anyone who owns a Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun, but i would prefer to not have to repeat games in order to be able to unlock others
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this is a wonderful game. I love to play it even though some of the games are hard.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really cool. there are lots of games and they are fun to unlock. too bad the update deleted my progress.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun there a lot of games like a soccer game it could be better like more money so over all its great
B0063IH60K|5.0|works well and is a fun game to play on the phone. I like that you can play random deal or winning deal
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is totally rad. it's the bomb! no game could ever beat this game. 101+16 games is the best game ever
B005HSL626|5.0|this game rocks! Slicing fruit looks so cool on this game! I have to admit, even when you hit the bombs, the explosion is awesome! so its cool either way.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Can't put it down!  I and my whole family use the one year plan now it's really helpful!  I recommend it to anyone with multiple devices it is seemless across my tablets and phones!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this is a great app I love it.  easy to setup easy to use.  probably 1 of the best apps I have downloaded
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its an ok game not the best cause you have to unlock the games before you can play them but it is an ok game and it passes time!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some of the games are tricky to figure out at first but overall the variety of games available makes this a great boredom curing app.

0553801473|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book having just finished the first four. I was looking forward to a culmination of plot lines, some definitive outcomes, if not the final outcome for the series. However what i got was waffle from characters known and unknown. It feels like the author has no idea where the story is going and for over 1000 pages long it did not go very far toward any kind of outcome. I dont think i will be purchasing book 6 and my investment in this series has come to an end.
B006P4FBUE|5.0|i cannot believe the quality in this; a digital piano with all the nessesities of a real one. i can't imagine where I'd get it elsewhere.
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I ordered this CD as a Christmas present for a dear friend.  It arrived well before the \\"needed by\\" date, and it was in excellent condition.  I would not hesitate to order from this site again in the future.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of different games, quick fun! Easy to learn and plenty of variety.When you have just a little time to kill, this is the game group to try.
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|Can't do much but scribble. Probably good for small children. I want to keep it uninstalled but Amazon routinely prompts me to reinstall. annoying Icon in phone corner.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|This Blu-ray was ordered as a christmas gift.  It was delivered promptly and was received with excitement.  If you haven't seen the movie - it is a MUST!
B001LF347E|5.0|I like this show and bought DVD for additional material (commentaries mostly). It's good quality and have nice extras to justify buying DVD instead of single episodes.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like and all but the games cost way to much I mean way but fun games pretty. good app
159514188X|5.0|This was the best book I have read in my entire life! It made me cry to listen to the pain in everyday life of Hannah Baker
0545265355|5.0|I got this set for christmas and I am already on the 3rd book. I absolutely love them! I would reccomend them for anyone in/above middle school. But if you're a parent trying to deside wether or not to let them read it, you should read them first. The first book alone is much more disturbing than any other books I've read, but it might not be as disturbing to some as it is to other. Overall, I'd deffinately reccomend the box set!
B006GLQIVC|1.0|I cannot BELIEVE the description of the final episode basically SPOILS the shocker of the whole season! I am NOT HAPPY about that. I don't know if this is Amazon's fault or FX or who, but that was just rude and stupid!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Just got this on Kindle Fire, some of the games are a bit tough (especially for someone like me who doesn't play many) but they're lots of fun and work well on my tablet
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is a tremendous series of depth and drama. The characters are incredibly developed to make for compelling stories, and the skill and effort put into every facet of the show - from acting to producing to set design - come through. In addition to the series itself being of top quality, the extra features on DVD are very interesting, especially the commentary of Sorkin and Schlamme, although I wish they had done more on the later seasons. You get a ton of great material in this collection. The best kind of classic storytelling.
B00175GCEU|5.0|This is definitely one of the better Friday Music vinyl reissues I've purchased. For the most part, there is very little, if any, unwanted surface noise. Good pressing. And the music is top notch. I'd recommend it.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|I had originally given this album 3 stars, but I took one away because I wanted Coldplay to feel the same pain that I felt when I listened to this album. Listening to this album is like finding out the person you've been in love with for years has just gotten married to someone else. Worse yet, it's as if you were about to marry the love of your life and they ran off after someone stood up and objected to the wedding. And there you stand, embarrassed and disappointed, with nothing left to live for except your cat that's been recently diagnosed with cancer.<br /><br />I loved Coldplay. And I still love Coldplay, but the problem is that I'm in love with the old Coldplay. \\"Featuring Rhianna\\" says it all. Coldplay has officially lost their indie cred. It's not that this is a bad album. It's just that it's a One Republic album.<br /><br />I often feel that an album is a reflection of a band's ego, and Coldplay has most definitley had their ego stroked quite a bit over the last few years. It's a big album. There are lots of big sounds and big melodies. Radio-friendly melodies. And Coldplay has always been radio-friendly, but at least their music always sounded fresh in the past. It sounded good on the first listen, but it sounded great by the twentieth listen. Vivia La Vida was a testament to the infectious songwriting abilities of the band. It was like a mystery that pulled you deeper and deeper into the storyline every time the album was played. In comparison, Mylo Xyloto is more like a billboard on the side of the freeway. It's there. It's simple. And then it's forgotten.<br /><br />The title sounds like the name of a Police album, but ironically it sounds like an early Police album when they were still raw and creative.<br /><br />There is one saving grace on Mylo Xyloto. Major Minus is a great song that actually sounds like it would have fit better on Vivia La Vida. As a matter of fact, it actually sounds out of place on Mylo Xyloto and probably should have been cut. Then it could have been used as a new track on their next album in which Coldplay decides to redeem themselves. Perhaps they'll decide next to destroy themselves the way U2 did when they released Achtung Baby. Or maybe their egos will break up the band like most other bands that get to stadium status. Then I suppose there's the possibility that Coldplay could do something that none of us expected. But I'm hoping they reflect on this album and see what they could have done differently. Maybe Major Minus is a sign that Coldplay is still under there somewhere.<br /><br />Maybe Coldplay will leave that other guy and decide they were happier when they were with us.d as a new track on their next album in which Coldplay decides to redeem themselves.

B004H1V5RU|4.0|This was purchased as a gift for my 14 year old son who is puzzle brainiac.  He loves all of the various puzzle items.  At first I thought this was a little cheaply made, but it seems to be more durable than I first realized.  The plastic ball is sealed and has a 3-D plastic maze in the center.  The object is to steer a small metal marble around the interior plastic track without it falling off.  It is much harder than it sounds.  I think a little more effort could have gone into the design as it is difficult to get the marble started.  There should only be one place to start so you can judge how well you do each time from the same starting location, but supposedly there are four different places to start from.  I've not found them all yet.    I think that I would buy this again knowing what I know now, but I would pay a little less.  It is a fun puzzle that will challenge teens and adults alike.  Enjoy!  Mike
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|Fantastic action movie but also is well made.<br /><br />Any movie with a sniper can't be that bad.<br /><br />Great to have in the collection and always entertaining.
B004LROMWU|5.0|The thing about Falling Skies was how real it was. As a history teacher myself, it was very easy to identify with Tom to begin with--there are those of us who really think like that. But suppose the aliens did come and knock out the satellites and electricity and all you had to survive on was pioneer instincts and big empty houses of a lost world. That is what continually got me. In fact, in viewing it over and over again, I starting thinking that way: and when the aliens come, we won't have THAT to rely on. But as long as the kids are safe...<br />So there you go, Spielburg has done it again. The petty problems of yesterday, with cellphones and fast cars and internet porn and even good food that you could take for granted at the end of the day--all gone.  And there is Tom, in the final shots of Season 1 ( forgive me if you are not there yet) taking the step because he needs to save his son, but also, also, yes, the reason historians live for, just to know what is there.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|Led Zeppelin performs beyond expectations. True to their format, they play on and on, seemingly forever. Excellent cuts of Jimmy Page's virtuoso guitar work. The pre-concert background was very interesting, especially Jimmy's playing the hurdy-gurdy. Good insights into the family life of the band members.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very interesting app. wish it did not have as many ads, though. it is at a good price.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Another stellar Adele performance in one of the world's best venues, The Royal Albert Hall. She gave this concert just before her throat surgery. During the concert she speaks of having throat problems, so it is a harbinger of things to come. Never the less, Adele's voice never fails. She's definitely on of the top three or four female singers in rock today.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games. I like to play the games. some of the games are hard to figure out, but its still a lot of fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have played these games before on my nintendo ds and I loved a lot of them so I really enjoy playing it...great time killer
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its an alright game on the kindle fire.  games get repetitive though.  but it is a great way to waste some time.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works great on the kindle fire!! I absolutely love it!  Great for games too ;)   (I got starcraft 2 working on it. A little hard to control, but it looks fantastic ) 5 stars!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great best games every i say all need this lil lil lol lol. can i has birds birds the word
0316098329|5.0|I first heard of this book on NPR, though for some reason the review I heard there (or at least thought I had heard) had me come out with a different idea of what the book was about. It really didn't matter, this was an amazing book! I love reading, but I am a slow reader and since my daughter was born a year ago I haven't been able to dedicate the time I'd like to pleasure reading. With that being said, I read this whole book in one weekend and enjoyed every minute of it!   The beginning of the book was a bit hard to get through, the writing was so different I would have to re-read a sentence or paragraph a second time just to make sure I was getting what I needed to get from it. Thankfully one gets used to the writing style (as narrated from a 5 year old boy), rather quickly.   While I enjoy reading, I am not a writer, so I will keep this review short and mention that even though I read this book over 7 months ago, it has stayed with me ever since. I keep thinking back to different parts of the book and really focusing on the events and what happened and replay those scenes in my head time after time again. Two of the only other books that has done this for me is Memoirs of a Geisha and Life of Pi, Room is truly on that level! While being very honest, I have to admit that this is one of THE best books I have ever read!
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|I'm only waiting the revival of the series at the cinema... long life for the best tv show ever!!  About the content of the discs, maybe they could have added a few extra material.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|i have this for the IPad, and really just wanted it for my phone.. now i have both :) great product, never have an issue caused by them
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I understand this is a cheap headphone amplifier, but for $30 you could at least have used better materials. This thing looks, feels, and works at that \\"meh\\" level. I returned mine. I didn't expect much, but I was still disappointed with the low output and poor material quality of this device. Made little to no difference - I would only recommend this if you needed a not-really-noticeable-at-all bump or if you just want the placebo effect.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Awesome ness should be the name of this game ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really good really good really good really good really good uses up time and definetly awesome I thought it was really good
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Ok, so everyone has heard of &quot; The famous angry birds. app!&quot;, but few of those people have had the actual experience of playing the addictive game. And I used to be one of those people. But not anymore, if you get this app, trust me, you will be thank full. There are amazing graphics and a very... Interesting plot sequence. Oh who am I kidding, now I sound like a nerd which I'm NOT. Ok, so my main message to you guys is GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was the first app I got om my kindle fire. And the best part is, its free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
033044123X|5.0|After having read two disappointing Baldacci novels (The Winner and Hell's Corner) that flattered to deceive, this one is a much better read. Graded on a curve, yes, this is a five-star read.<br /><br />Oliver Stone, fka John Carr, is still very much a man of mystery here. His past is decades behind him and we are not given much background there. The Camel Club has already been in existence for years. What we do get to learn is that there is a very sinister plot being, err.. plotted, to assassinate the President of the United States, and too in his hometown. Arabs, Pakistanis, Iranians, and well, basically, it looks like Islamic terrorists may be involved. That cannot be a good thing. And then there is this killing of an NIC operative that is witnessed by the Camel Club. The plot makes it way through the book in an unhurried though gripping manner. The climax is fast-paced, and the denouement takes place in a former CIA and now abandoned facility named \\"Murder Mountain\\".<br /><br />Having read two of Baldacci's novels, The Winner and Hell's Corner, both promising but ultimately disappointing, The Camel Club is much better. The plot, and especially the ending, when fully revealed, is still fantastical, and I will note again, one that could have been written by Mahatma Gandhi - without saying more. Read the book to find out. Parts of the plot are still a little implausible, but that is excusable here.<br /><br />In short, gripping fast-paced turner that doesn't ask for much thinking from the reader - the ideal paperback!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game I mean..... games! this is an awesome app and if u like funny games this is defidently the app 4 u!!!!!!
B005DF2QMC|3.0|It has been years since I have been able to play any of my old cassettes, but I still wanted to retrieve some of my old music, so I was really happy to find that this cassette to MP3 converter had actually come down into my price range.  While this player will work for me, I'm not sure if this player will work for everyone.  The player itself is a lot like one of those old Sony Walkmans that you might have had if you were around in the days before CD players.  In fact, if you don't have a computer, you can actually use it like a Walkman, as it has a headphone jack.  It doesn't look like it's the best quality around, but it does the job just fine.  Hooking up the player to my computer was very easy, and my computer recognized the device right away.  Most people should have no problem with this part of the conversion process.  It's the software part of this process that some people could have trouble with.  I had to play around with the device to get it to work.  The 9 page instruction book is not detailed enough, IMO.  It tells you how to play the device, and how to install the Audacity software, but not much else.  It doesn't tell you how to set up the audio input so that your computer is interpreting the USB inputs as a microphone... I had to play around with this to get this set up correctly.  Also, I found the Audacity software to be low quality and pretty much useless: even though the music was going into my computer crisply, Audacity did a poor job of encoding it for me.  The music ended up quiet and full of echoes.  I ended up using Adobe Soundbooth to encode my .mp3 files instead.  With the provided hardware and another software product to do the encoding for me, I am able to get some really good .mp3s made from my cassettes.  I should add that in college I took several classes in music recording, which comes in handy when editing the files.  If you have to rely on the provided Audacity software to convert your recordings, you might be disappointed.  Also, ifyou have very little patience for computers and/or don't know much about sound editing, you may want to get help from a computer-savvy friend to get it set up.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|omg!!! i was unsure at first how i would like tvd cuz it's about vampires and werewolfs and well twilight's conquered that love story but this is much more than that!!! every episode is different and it really shows how each character is important to the main plot! ah! just awesome! keeps you wanting more!
B0036T1RMM|5.0|I liked this film years ago in the theater. I liked it even better later on dvd. I watched recently maybe for the 4th or 5th time and this time now LOVED it... it just blew me away! I sometimes watch favorite movies again and again...kinda comfort food... but I've never had this experience of a movie I liked and knew pretty well just suddenly knocking my socks off and vaulting to the top of my \\"best movies list\\"....guess when the student is ready the movie will appear :)  Hence I too as the last reviewer, felt compelled to put in a positive plug... and I'll also add a nicely written piece of an old review which I think sums it up well for me:  \\"If you can appreciate that a movie can touch your heart, can be something more than just simple entertainment, and can actually say something both simple and profound about the human condition, then you will love Magnolia. It is not easy watching. It is at turns foul-mouthed, confused, chaotic, irrational, depressing, uplifting, unrealistic, too realistic, unpredictable, heavily symbolic, violent, and unflinchingly, gut-wrenchingly honest in its portrayal of damaged characters trying to make sense of the wreckage of their lives. And yet, through all of this there is a beacon of hope and redemption that shines through, and most of the characters do find the strength to carry on. Watching Magnolia is like having an entire lifetime's worth of powerful emotions crammed into a three hour movie. If you have an open mind, and an open heart, you must see this movie. I have a hard time imagining how anyone will ever be able to make a better one.\\"...from this site M. 2004.  I'll just add that the last 5 seconds of the movie is pure redemption.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|nobody puts baby in a corner!!! this movie always fits any mood for movie watching!!! best of patrick swayze!!! who doesnt love forbidden love???
0765365278|5.0|I've read a lot of books from some really talented authors like Joan Vinge and Lois McMaster Bujold. Sanderson is my favorite. This is a really great book. I will say one thing though. It took me longer to get into than some of his other books. After I got to page 200 or so, I couldn't stop reading though.  The only other problem is that he throws in chapters, introducing entirely new characters at various points - which threw me off because of the lack of context.
6305212112|5.0|not only is this a great girlie movie its very historical and funny! it's just the whole package wrapped into one film!!! you fall in love over and over and see what true friendship is really all about!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire has nice graphics and is an great free App for Kindle Fire.  It allows personalization of play options such as 3 card or 1 card draw.  Overall a fun game.
6305696071|5.0|it's kinda like the cinderella story as only in l.a. could be told! love the chemestry between juilia and richard! just a great film all around for the slums to riches and a dang good love story.
B003TEO3EI|5.0|Of course they can do wrong, they are human.  This album is good.  It's got 2 songs I normally skip.  The rest I gladly listen too.
B003L77GH4|5.0|it took me all of like 1 1/2 days to watch this!!! love it!!! always a good rewatch too!!! better than the books! best show on tv!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it a good game with lots of games. it keeps me intertand while traveling, but I would like it to be less points.
B004WE01YA|4.0|enjoyable movie in an upgraded form. good but not great 3d (not as good as the newest made in 3d movies).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is great pretty hard but hey that's why you buy stuff I loove it though don't get upgrades or you will lose progress
0307891402|4.0|I saw this like a day before i orderd it and it was only $21.99 and the next day when i went to order it the price was $37 and it enden up coming to like $41 with the shipping, so if your looking to save money wait till the price goes back down to $21.99.
1849386684|4.0|Been watching Justin's videos for a few years and glad to see a book come out now.  I really like it and can say that my playing has improved from this book as well as the videos he puts out for the songs.  A great combination.  My wish is that it was spiral bound to stay open easier but it still works.  Found some great songs that I had never known before.  Well worth the money!
B005LB1MY6|5.0|This album is very different from the first; listen to the previews! It's a completely different sound, but still Justice. I like it, but I can definitely imagine someone who doesn't.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I found it to be almost useless, mostly because of the limitations on streaming anything that used full screen, and the controls seemed a little tricky, but shouldnt be a problem with practice. I couldnt seem to get Starcraft to run through it either, despite useing an application to run it windowed. It certainly has its uses, just nothing to justify buying it at full price. I imagine people with a few technical tricks up thier sleeve will find it especialy usefull however, but for me it simply makes a good way to check on my downloads while Im in bed.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|For those that want the facts delivered in an entertaining way this movie does just that. As in most movies some artistic liberties are taken, but overall the movie depicts events leading up to and the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. The movie shows that the American military can be and was very arrogant before the attack, and the Japanese not prepared or willing to complete the mission they set out to accomplish. Mistakes were made by both the Americans and the Japanese and the movie does point those out. I have used this movie in my high school World and American history classes to demonstrate what really happened before and on December 7,1941.
B00275EGX8|2.0|The filmmakers alleged that they set out to make a movie about the war in Iraq. In this they failed miserably. The vets who have been there or in any other conflict panned it for good reason. The redeeming qualities are the picture on the screen and the audio track. Here an exemplary job has been done. It is difficult to believe that much of the film was shot on 16mm.  This movie more closely resembles 'Call of Duty' or other war games than it does the actual Iraq war. However, it does have pretty pictures.
B0001I561E|5.0|The product was exactly what was described.  Super transaction and very quick delivery.  My 17 year old daughter was thrilled to receive the Aladdin DVD, as it is no longer sold in stores.  Thank you!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is the best game i have on my phone. it is so fun that i deleted all the other games on my phone.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I have a Nerve beach cruiser and was nervous a rear bike seat would not work with my fenders so I decided to go for the front seat style.  I LOVE IT! I installed it myself - but my husband will tell you I'm pretty handy - but still it was easy!  And there is no damage to my bike so when we are done with it my bike is still perfect! My son loves his seat too!  He's a big 1 yr old  and I read a review about the foot guards being small but they were fine with fat crocks on and the seat is snug but there is room to grow with the seat.  When we got done with our first \\"test ride\\" he grabbed my hand and drug me back to the bike pointing and grunting for another ride!  I was also REALLY concerned about having to peddle wide to compensate for the seat between my legs - I am 5'8\\" and I barely had to adjust for my knees, it's not noticeable enough to make any strange muscles sore or bother me.  I also wondered about my son being able to grab the handle bars.  Yes, he can hold on to them, but he tends to either put his hands on the padded ledge or on his lap so it hasn't been an issue for us.  Shipped quickly and I would recommend this product!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Good program very useful,wonder about security..Enjoy this program. Will try it on my Droid X. Helps with many tasks. Give.it a try.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I have used this and phonemypc. phonemypc was $15. this was free. splashtop even performed better. you can hear audio where phonemypc didn't. perfect A+++

B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good for the kids, keeps them entertained. the games are simple enough for little kids! Doesnt keep me entertained though...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game looks good so far, just downloaded it so I haven't played all of the games but will recommend this
0312983867|5.0|Having read earlier books in the Stephanie Plum series, when I purchased this book I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed! I haven't had the opportunity to read any other Janet Evanovichbooks, but I have the feeling that she never disappoints with her books. I know that Janet Evanovich never disappoints when writing The Stephanie Plum series! Every one of the books in the series is so intriging, that I usually end up reading them for hours! About the only bad thing I could think of to say about this series, is that sometimes I get so wrapped up in the books, I end up reading very, very late into the night ... not a good thing when you need to get up early to go to work!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this product I can go on any wick or 3g network and go on my computer if I want to!! And it works  Just as fast if I were really close to my computer. I just wish they would make game mode or something so.we.could easily play our games cause as of right now its hard
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Fabulous CD!!  I purchased my first copy and then bought two more for gifts!!  Their music is  so inspiring and uplifting...filled with evidence of life's experiences!!  You can never go wrong with James Taylor!! I would recommend this CD to the young and old of heart!!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this cover!  I knew when I got my Kindle Keyboard 3G that I wanted a durable, elegant cover that would adequately protect my Kindle in a variety of locations (the most dangerous of which is perhaps my purse). The elastic straps are a bit tight on my Kindle, so for convenience's sake I never remove my Kindle from the cover.  However, the leather folds back without any noticeable wear (though I've only had it two months).  My only complaint is the lack of a snap to hold the cover closed - a very minor concern.  I love this case and how different it is stylistically from the other options on the market.  My mother also loves this case and is getting an identical one for her Kindle Fire.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is a must have for those who want to stream videos from their computer to mobile device. Brilliant!
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Gets up and going right from the start and like the Energizer Bunny, keeps going and going right up until the very last minute. What a great ride! Love this flick. Great story, special effects, directing and acting.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this book and I downloaded it cause a friend posted a fb status saying it was free, but I absolutely LOVED IT! I stayed up til 6am reading cause I just couldn't put it down - it's that good! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait for a sequel!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|so many choices you don't get bored. I wish you could play offline too. I have everyone in my house playing this now. I love how you get to progress too.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|it sucks it wont let me download it I will never play this stupid app it is a waste of time
0439023521|5.0|and THAT is what I look for in books, expecially Trilogy's.  I prefer to read series or trilogy's after most or all of the books are out.  I read pretty fast and feel as if I might knaw my fingernails out waiting for the next book!  I am so glad that I waited until all the books are out for this read.  A nice change from some of the other books but still included what I like most: Adventure, danger and intrigue!  As for the romantic part about it - I liked how the author really took the time to portray the 2 different sides to the emotions.  Wonderful to see that even while your characters are fighting for their lives, literally! Just finished this today and I have loaded the next 2 books into my kindle and CAN'T WAIT to sit down later and start book 2!
B005HSL626|1.0|you should not waste your time this app is so stupid I hate this dumb app I cant install it

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it, its a great way to pass the time! the games are really fun, this game gets five stars from me.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is my favorite Disney film, actually it might be my favorite movie OF ALL TIME! The story is GREAT.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is very interesting and entertaining. I have fun playing it my fab game is the frog game on 101games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are a lot of games to choose from and the point system is very nice I like it a lot :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun app definetly recommend since its free great time waster somewhat addictive trying to get enough points to unlock the next game.
B001F12J48|1.0|As with those that are writing about the 3d version only I would also strongly advise you to save your money.  The glasses that come with the movie are a complete waste of time and my Sony glasses don't work with the movie.  Amazon needs to remove all the reviews that are about the movie in general, and keep only the reviews of the 3D version, because the movie is good, however the 3D version IS NOT - DON'T BUY.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Its so so so cool and fun sick and every thing u would for in a game. So If u like fun games this is da 1 4 u
B006IGZWB2|4.0|The movie does a Hallmark number on the story line of the book, prettying things up, making them glossy, removing some intense and important events. Two of these I feel are critical and I can't imagine why they were left out. Their inclusion would have done a much better job of conveying the horror and dangers of living under forced segregation. The acting was good, and carries what might otherwise have fallen flat. It isn't a bad movie, but treats the subject matter more superficially and lightheartedly than the book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game, it is easy to use and since I can't play it at work anymore, it's fun to play it at home, like the old times!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its not a bad app. some games are stupid, but a lot of them are pretty fun. wouldn't pay for it though...
B0063GORYU|5.0|this is a good game. few ads, easily avoided. would recommend to anyone who loves spider. would get again on a new device.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I almost gave this 4 stars since it's a short trip from the beginning to 3 stars on every level, but it's so much fun, the graphics and sound are so charming, and it's so cheap that doing that would be wrong. At $2.49 it would be 4 stars, but not as is.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is the best remote desktop for android! Be sure to get this, especially while it's free on the Amazon appstore.

B005GVF95O|5.0|My 29 month old toddler was in love with this game at first sight. When we started she was much more confident with the solid animal puzzles (5 or so whole animals to drop in slots) and went from thinking age couldn't do it to being very successful and picking up speed quickly. She can do the other puzzles (pieces to make one animal) but right now gets a little frustrated, but I think she'll get the hang of it and learn fast. The sound od applause is great and she cheers everytime gets a piece correct. Also, the fact that you just have to hover over the right place and the piece gets sucked in is perfect for her beginning touch screen fingers.<br /><br />Absolute love from this mama!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and challenging and naked you want to play it it.But the graphics aren&rsquo;t the best at all though the games are fun and it should be hallways be ranked 4 1/2.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love it! I like the fact that I can highlight a verse in different colors. The only thing that sorta' bugs me is that whenever I close the app then later get back on, the verse isn't highlighted.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|I got this game when it was free, but it is well worth $2. The graphics are great, and our whole family ends up laughing and having a great time. It can be a little difficult to control, but its a great time.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|I'm an intermittent Kate Bush fan and bought this CD after listening to it on a streaming site.  Instead of finding 50 words to describe it, I'll use one:  Sublime.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|I have read all of Michael Crichton's books and I still long for the Andromeda Strain type of adventure.  This book not only stretched the reaches of science but also your imagination. Not realistic.  If you want an lesson in entomology then this is the book for you. It dawdled on for page after page of tedious description that added only somewhat to the book.  OK, OK Richard I am impressed you stayed awake in college for those biology courses.  You don't have to put us to sleep now.  I read it all because I paid my money for the Kindle edition.  If I had gotten it from the library or borrowed it from a friend I would have taken it back.  Cheapskate that I am, I read it because I bought it.  Apparently not enough to do in my life.    Don't get this book unless you have a need to go to sleep at night or have a craving desire to learn more about bugs, etc. than you ever wanted to know.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love it, very useful on the go. I use it to share the gospel at work. it is great for daily reading also.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Fun games. Controls are sticky at times and saving the points for the good games takes control. All in all, a great way to kill time and have a little time.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Amazon just offered this for free on their app store, so I thought I'd give it a try. It works wonderfully and lets me check both my desktop and laptop with ease. It does passably well at browsing, and streams media reasonably well, although some files did hitch every once in a while. For what it is, what it does, and in my case what it cost, it's a handy little app with some serious potential!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I hate just sitting. I like to play games even while watching TV. This series of games is perfect! It only gives you 10 games to begin with, but.you play those games and obtain a minimum score to unlock more. Best of all...it's free!!
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Like the other reviews, I found the box a little cheap.  Should be more of a collectors box not just plain cardboard with nothing to make it special
B0054JZC6E|5.0|addicting(: this game is so fun and I love playing it! there are a bunch of really fun games! so fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun I love it some are challenging but it is still fun at the same time
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app works great on the Kindle Fire. If you have trouble using it check out the support pages on the Splashtop home page. I am currently using the app to connect to my Gateway Win 7 laptop. When I first connected to my laptop the screen was black on the Fire and all I could see was the mouse pointer but no icons from my computer. I searched the support pages for &quot;black screen display&quot; and found that all I had to do was download a .reg file which is already provided on the support pages. Great job!

030746363X|5.0|This is my first review on Amazon, and I'm making it after 3 months of having starting reading 4HB.  Am writing with focus on how it has helped me in that time  I began to read 4HB in early Oct 2011 after having a rough previous few months of injuries, colds and sickness, and had been started to feel a bit slow and bloated & was constantly tired.  In terms of my profile - Male 35yo, 5 11, Professional office job, was hovering about 86-88kg, reasonable amount of gym and fitness activity, but around 23% body fat. Waist measurement had blipped out to 96cm - and my chest/waist ratio was 1.07 - getting towards the dreaded 1.0 or worse!! Was still regular running, doing 48-50min 10kms (when not injured or my ankles killing me), and a solid 1.42 half marathon earlier in 2011 (although I used to be quicker 3-5 years back).  Kept trying to 'get fitter' again over past couple of years but struggled to make real progress due to lack of structure & commitment, plus a very demanding office job with 50-60hr weeks which is hardly helpful.  I've implemented a few of the concepts and sections from Tim's 4HB in the 3 months Oct 2011 - Dec 2011, key ones being:  * the base Slow carb diet - Focus on animal proteins, beans and vegetables.  I really backed right off the grains, breads, rice/pasta, fruit and 'drinking carbs.  Loved the 1 cheat day a week though.  * Added various of the recommended additional vitamin mineral supplements referred to for supporting fat loss. Just trying now some of the 'greens' style vegetable extract stuff also.  * Focus on short visits of big weight/slow rep training for legs at gym.  Unfortunately due to strained right forearm ligament - from PC/mouse RSI at work which I had from Sept, which has still lingered, I've done basically NO upper body/Arm based gym training in this three months period.  * Only exception to this is the Kettle bell work recommended by Tim which i begun recently but due to forearm haven't yet been able to go at full weight I wouldbe capable on this.  * Using Tim's recommended as most effective ab exercises, which are pretty killer  * Adding sprint training sessions per in book as key part of run training.  Now using longer runs less regularly and just as a check point on progress.  During the 1st month of Oct I did barely any fitness work as was still recovering from the earlier chest infection & cold, but kicked off with the diet as a starting point.  I lost about 4kg in the first two weeks and it just kept falling off from there.  You could tell it was all body fat as my barrel of a stomach just started to shrink.  The first week or so your body really screams at having the dense refined carbs & sugar taken away and you have to force feed on a lot of the recommended stuff to make up for it, but soon your body adjusts and thrives on it.  By the end of week three I was feeling really good and started getting back into training.  Was quite cool though losing so much fat during this first 3 week period with NO exercise.  After 3 months I'm now at 78kg, muscles are really starting to ripple out again (est around 16% BF) and I'm feeling really energetic and fired up virtually all the time.  Performing much better at work, having lost the sugar highs & lows throughout the day, and generally a lot happier.  Waist measurement has dropped back to 85cm and Chest/Waist ratio improved to 1.2.  Basically losing that 8-10kg of mostly body fat does wonders. Not in days of aches and pains after every run or gym visit.  Clocking 10km runs now at 44mins!!  Coming back to work in Jan after 3 weeks holiday (where I maintained the diet/training) I've had a lot of feedback on people really noticing the difference.  I've also just bought my 3rd copy of 4HB, as I've given two away to friends.  I like to have it handy to re-read sections or pick out something new. - As Tim says the book is like a buffet - not a cover to cover read.  For the 2nd 3 months I've got some simple goals.  I'm aiming to stabilise at current weight, but continue to drop body fat down to 12%, and get the muscle groups bulking up again for a chest/waist ratio 1.3x.  Also looking to get 10km time down to 42mins by end of March.  I still feel like I've just scratched the surface on what's possible and that there is still plenty of room to progress some more, especially now my forearm issue has died down and I can re-introduce some upper body training shortly.  There is some genuinely useful stuff in 4HB and its quite simple to follow and fun to read.  I like how the diet focus doesn't have a whole load of complications about what exact meal plans to be eating when.  Its basically just what not to eat, so shop to try and meet that.  A few things I don't agree 100% with Tim, based on other reading and my experience, but on the whole, a lot of good material.  Also another point for me is that the book is just a good kick in the backside to 'take control' of your dietary habits and lifestyle and follow a few rules and stick to them.. The 'minimum effective dose' approach to training with short sessions also means you can fit it in with a busy work life.  Once you start to see the positive effect you stick to it, and I've slowly introduced a few more areas suggested in the different chapters that interest me.  I'd recommend having a read of 4HB and committing to follow a few sections in the diet and training programme as a great kick start for any 'average' type who really wants to get back in top condition.  Cheers Tim for the 4HB!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is great!! just like when i was a kid!!! Love love and I have won every deal so far.

0920668372|1.0|I found this book to be very creepy. I actually threw it in the trash, the first time I have EVER done that with a book. The mom skulking around sneaking into the kid's room was just not right. I can see where the author was trying to go with the story, but the execution was terrible. I don't understand the fascination with this book at all.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|This complete collection has 42 cuts - 29 songs with 13 alternates - along with two test grooves.  It is on two CDs in a trifold jewel case.  A booklet with some photos is in the front of the case.  Songs are vocal and guitar by Robert Johnson - this was before the days of full bands.  I thought that the sound was good, so I don't know what some others are complaining about.  At 75, my hearing may not be the best but it sounded fine to me.  This is a must have collection for anyone collecting the blues.  Others are the Willie Dixon Chess Box (songs written by Willie Dixon as the house songwriter for the Chess brothers studio, and performed by himself and others)[[ASIN:B000WR7HUC The Chess Box]]; The Muddy Waters Chess Box (all vocals by himself, with a band that sometimes included Willie Dixon on standup bass)[[ASIN:B000WSWIIW The Chess Box]]; the Howlin Wolf Chess Box[[ASIN:B0011U39BK The Chess Box]]; etc.  See separate reviews.<br /><br />For a written account about Robert Johnson, see [[ASIN:0060524278 Escaping the Delta: Robert Johnson and the Invention of the Blues]].  Blues musicians tended to play about the lives that they led, and some are said to have sold their souls to the devil.  You can get the flavor of the times from the recent short story collection edited by Carolyn Haines, [[ASIN:1935562061 Delta Blues]]  For factual information try [[ASIN:0393337502 Delta Blues: The Life and Times of the Mississippi Masters Who Revolutionized American Music]] or maybe [[ASIN:0140062238 Deep Blues: A Musical and Cultural History of the Mississippi Delta]]  Other items of interest might be [[ASIN:B00138F576 The Original Delta Blues (Mojo Workin': Blues For The Next Generation)]]

B004Q7E0TA|5.0|Portia de Rossi's Unbearable Lightness is not her entire life story. It is a glimpse into the mind and life of a woman struggling with an eating disorder, perfectionism, and a desire for acceptance. The book is beautifully written, blunt and painful, never scrimping on the horrific details of her struggle with herself and with the thin-obsessed establishment. In writing this story Portia re-entered a world of insanity, giving a powerful insight into the life of a person with an Eating Disorder. If you want to learn more about how a person with an ED thinks and feels, read this book. A word of caution: if you struggle with an ED, the book could be triggering. Make sure you are surrounded by an accountable support system before diving into this book.  On a purely literary note, de Rossi is a powerful, engaging author, and I hope this isn't her last book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I highly reccomend this no firewalls ports to bypass its just a simple download and use and there is very little lag and to get it for free is a steal
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Much smoother and quicker than teamviewer, but completely pointless because I can't get past my lockscreen. Only records about 20% of all keys entered. If I can't even enter my password this app is entirely useless.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun game and I was bored so that was the title of this review it is interesting to play
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have so much fun I got it 5 min. I love the frog game and the bat game and you can play it without paying for it.
B004EPYZXU|1.0|Movies like this make me believe Amazon and other sites should give the option for one totally dissatisfied with a product to give it a 'zero' rating flat-out. Unfortunately, I have to give this terrible movie a 1-star, which I feel is even too generous.<br /><br />Basically, the film is \\"found footage\\" of a mission to the moon gone hilariously (I mean, \\"horribly\\") wrong. Two young men are shot up to the moon on a secret mission (not so secret when you make a mainstream film out of it) to place detectors on the moon during the cold war. However, upon landing the crew of astronauts discover something strange, something weird... Something...<br /><br />******SPOILER ALERT******<br />...a lot like lobsters?<br />*******END SPOILERS******<br /><br />And before anyone gives me any flack for watching the film or paying to see it--Yes, I paid to see it at the theater opening weekend. I write a movie review blog and that weekend this was literally the only film that appealed to me. And quite literally, I was hoping this would have something truly creepy.<br /><br />However, once we're aware of what the film's main threat is, it turns from being a somewhat creepy sci-fi horror film into the year's most unintentional comedy. I recall many people including myself actually LAUGHING during the screening. The MST3K crew would have a blast with this film, and here's to hoping someone at RiffTrax sees this and gives me a real reason to watch it again.<br /><br />Until then, this film is complete garbage, and truly the worst film of 2011.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|greatest app, just wish it worked when the \\"main comp\\" monitor is off. very cool tho....my fire looks like a mini moms computer.  BUT, they can see EVERYTHING i do ..eek :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app and is a lot of fun to play.  there are sooo many different mini games and i like the idea of earning points by playing in order to unlock more games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun but the graphics aren't to wonderful. Also they have lots of cool games. Overall I think this is worth downloading.
B004P2CQM4|5.0|We bought the Shark and the Clownfish for our two grandsons for Christmas. They are both fun toys.  The first one we put together took us most of one evening.  The first thing you need to do is get them inflated. I was going to buy one of the  disposable canisters of helium at a party store, but the honest gentleman there told me that they don't come with the right tip for inflating resealable mylar balloons. I took them to my local Piggly Wiggly store and they filled them for $4.00 a piece.  Just need a vehicle large enough to transport two large fish. Assembly was definately a 2 person job.  Once they were together and you get the right amount of putty in place for weight, they were a lot of fun.  We have had trouble keeping some of the tape in place but I would recomend this product. I think my husband and I had as much fun with them as the kids. Both, our house and my grandkids house, have open vaulted ceilings and some open stairways to the basements.  They are perfect for flying these characters.  They are like having 2 more pets in the house. If you have vaulted ceilings, make sure you tie your fish to a chair or something while you are working on them. The voice of experience here!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i kinda like it cuz when i have nothing else to do i just play this game and it is fun for kids
B006QPVH6O|5.0|This footage is believable enough to make me want to search more in depth<br />about if there really was an Apollo 18.<br />Its very good and a bit scary....definitely worth the<br />rental!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|\\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" is a well-executed adaptation of John Le Carre's classic espionage novel of the Cold War, with a first-rate cast, a haunting atmosphere, and a compelling narrative.<br /><br />\\"Tinker\\" goes right to work.  The opening sequence has field agent Jim Prideaux (Mark Strong) on an off-the-books mission to Hungary for the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service, known as Control (John Hurt).  Control suspects a mole within the upper reaches of the Service, and asks Prideaux to send back a codeword identifying the spy, using the children's nursery rhyme.  The mission is compromised, Priddeaux is shot, and Control and his deputy George Smiley (Gary Oldman) are fired.<br /><br />A restless Smiley is recalled to duty by a senior civil servant to investigate some unfinished business involving Ricki Tarr (a blonde Tom Hardy), a field agent who claims to know a vital Soviet secret and who has gone off the grid.  With the assistance of Tarr's desk officer, the young Peter Guillam (an astonishingly good Benedict Cumberbatch), Smiley quietly renews the search for the mole.  Some old-fashioned detecting leads Smiley and Guillam down a thin trail of clues to four suspects and a fateful confrontation at a house in London.<br /><br />Although only two hours long, \\"Tinker\\" manages to work in the key elements from a long novel, and gets some terrific work from the cast, especially Gary Oldman as Smiley, a weary Cold War veteran whose long brooding silences speak volumes.  The 1970's setting of the novel is evoked in detail with hair and clothing fashions, music, and technical props such as typewriters, old-fashioned teletypes, and reel-to-reel tape recorders.  The pacing of the story keeps the suspense alive to the end.<br /><br />The inevitable comparison is with the superb BBC TV mini-series of the late 1970's starring Alec Guinness as Smiley.  It is a weakness of the movie that at just two hours, it lacks the time to properly introduce the many characters or the period to a modern audience who may not have experienced the Cold War.  There isn't a lot of exposition in the movie, and this reviewer, who was very familiar with the novel and the mini-series, suspects some viewers may have trouble following the story.<br /><br />\\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" is highly recommended as an excellent and atmospheric spy drama.nce who may not have experienced the Cold War.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|love that its a challenge to get more games. makes it worth playing ...five stars!! glad that me and my sister chose this app we both cant get enough of it
0385535139|5.0|I received this book a few weeks ago from a friend that is also a huge John Grisham fan. I was thrilled.  I think I have read almost all of this writer's fine stories including \\"The Litigators,\\" his newest pen.<br /><br />The litigators is a page-turning read, filled with the kind of courtroom suspense, strategies, and (yes) even theatrics that famed Perry Mason would be impressed with.  In my opinion this book is one of Grishams finest stories and should be on all suspense-lovers \\"must read\\" lists.<br /><br />The story is exciting (the pages seem to turn themselves), the characters are believable and the plot will have the reader flipping through the pages as fast as they can.  I'm happy to suggest this book to all readers that enjoy this genre.  I enjoyed the experience very much.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I recommend grabbing the free version to try. But I use the HD version on my Samsung Galaxy Tab and love it. HD version gets 5 stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is splendid.<br />I can be doing other things have have the audio on, can listen and get baking or house keeping done...<br />It is very nice!<br />Everything about my kindle is A+.<br />I got my kindle at Amazon, wondered and thought about the purchase for days!<br />Then I up and got it, and, WOW....the Bible reading is so special!<br />[[ASIN:B004MC8CA2 Bible]][[ASIN:B0043VDZL8 Free Brain and Puzzle Apps for Android]]
B005CA4SQK|5.0|This is a great comic book and even better when brought to life!<br />I recommend this to anyone that love zombies. I can't wait for season 2 to come out.
0345529057|5.0|Books were in a great shape, made a good gift. books packed well, and came fast. Very pleased. Person recieving gift was very pleased with them. Likes stories.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have used Pocketcloud in the past and this is so much more feature rich! I can connect to multiple computers instead of just one. I work at a radio station and it's nice to be able to check the work email on the go and listen to commercials through the phone from the work pc.. and even put the spot into rotation! Full access is what remote desktop should be all about and it this brings it!! So glad this was the app of the day!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great little free app. Good variety and enough of a challenge to keep it interesting. I also liked the unlock feature - it adds an additional level of challenge.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Very easy to install the kindle in the case. I like that it doesn't add too much bulk, while still providing sufficient protection. All four corners are covered, and enough room is left open to reach buttons and speakers. I've not dropped it yet, but the case has a nice sturdy feel that leaves me confident that it will be protected if it should slip - but the elastic band adds an extra bit of protection, as I slip my hand underneath it to help hold it in my hand. The case is also attractive, and made of an animal friendly material (not leather)...
B0063IH60K|5.0|l really love the ease on which this game is played on the Fire.  Lots of fun for Solitaire lovers.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Alex Kendrick once again brought me to tears more than once in this inspirational movie! The individualized story lines as well as the action will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Keep them coming Alex!  I will be among many waiting eagerly for your next production!
0545265355|5.0|I'm not a fast reader and I was able to read these books in just 3 days.  They draw you in and keep you interested clear to the end.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I would give a five but I've only played a few game! But what I've played I like! Good time waster.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|When i first downloaded this app it wouldn't open. Now I can never get through a level without it crashing. This game is a piece of crap, i'm uninstalling!
B004LWZW4W|4.0|Science and experiments that altered the species, leaves humanity in harmes way in the future world. Entertaining, and outside the box.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a really clean easy to play solitaire game.  Not sure how basic solitaire can be so addictive, but it somehow is.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game. there is many different varieties of games to choose from. I'm just writing this review to get coins :)
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I wasn't sure about needing this app as I already have the Log Me In Ignition, but I sure am glad I did! This app is super simple to set up for home connection and for away connection all you need is a Gmail account. I was really impressed by the speed of the connection. I was actually able to watch a video with sound and minimal to no lag. This cannot be done with the Log Me In Ignition app which has a lot of lag an no sound through put.   To clarify, I will be keeping both apps as they each have very specific purposes. The reason LMII has lag is because the connection is encrypted, which would be important for some obvious tasks and it also has the ability to keep the host computer screen blank so someone can't peak at whats on your screen. Splashtop is fast and supports sound which is great for other obvios tasks that do not require encryption.   Only docked one star for not being able to keep the host screen blank, but other than that a very good app, well worth whatever price they are asking.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I've tried many methods for remote access to my systems, and this (to date) is the fastest, and easiest I have found.  easy to use and well thought out.   best free app of the day for me so far.  thanks!
B0058EBNAO|3.0|Great weather app. Does well for location that are not big cities which most other apps don't provide forecast for.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|lots of different patterns to play but randomly kicks you out of the game. would be a million times more enjoyable if it didn't do that
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I tried teamViewer but this app works very well ...setup is dam easy and free for the day now PC can be operated from anywhere with my mobile
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I think of all the free apps of the day that Amazon has released this is my favorite.  I'm glad that people mentioned that the connection is not encrypted, but as long as you are using it in your home network its a great piece of software.  One thing that I use it for is that I can control my desktop webcam from my Kindle fire.  This would be great if you are a parent with a new born as a free video baby monitor.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it gives you something to do. you could easily play this app for an hour...some games are challenging. I would definatly reccomend it if u haave nothing else to do.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie was such a pleasure to see. It left me thinking about all that happened, and how beautiful their interest for one another turns out to be more than anything ordinary. I consider it one of the best romantic movies on my list.
0439023483|5.0|I loved this book i read the entire serires really quikly with a group of friends we all could'nt wait to find out what happened next! Sometimes we found ourselves crying in class because of something that happened in the book! it is brilliant! this book soo became my life and i can practically recite the books because i read them so many times and they are just that amazing! this book is thrilling at some points dramatic at others and hillarious inbetween...(Finnick Odair). I am so excited for the movie even though i'm scared they are going to wreck the book like they did with percy jackson... but if they get it perfect my life shall be complete!! you are going to love it!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy playing it and would recommend it if you're very bored. There's s nice variety of games so you wont get bored
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good time waster. Some games seem a little hard to beat. Over all simple and fun. Hope I get the coins I was promised for this....
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Truely a brilliant book.  It's not just about Barefoot running and ultrarunning, Its a story about ppl, a history on footwear, Nike's disservice to the world of feet.  Great!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. it offers the Bible in so many different versions and translations and languages that it's bound to have your favorite! It will even read the Bible to you. It includes tons of great devotional and Bible reading plans in case you don't know where or how to get started. You can highlight verses that are meaningful to you in any color and take notes as you read. This is THE Bible app for every device!
B004AUHWLQ|5.0|Billy Wilder's iconoclastic style of filmmaking is at its best in the APARTMENT, a film that is almost an anti-romantic comedy that watches like a classic suspense thriller.  At times it is indeed very funny, but at the same time its tragic, melodramatic and makes you think deeply about human relationships... Its also interesting because it takes place in the generation of \\"Mad Men\\" and \\"How To Succeed In Business\\" -- reflecting some of the cynical views of the vain and sexist corporate culture that are now norms in mainstream thought, but digs a little deeper, walking a fine line.  Shirley MacLaine's character, through much of the film is sad and tragic, MacMurray plays a self centered, vile hypocritical jerk -- Lemmon is a likable, if not pitiful schlemiel type... but the screenplay balances out the story so that the any extreme's of the character's behavior fall into the story as a whole and don't steal the show making it any one actor's vehicle.  -- MacMurray's awkwardly heartless and jerky character as a result, is not a scene stealing villian, MacClaine's tragic sadness doesn't steal the film so as to make it her vehicle... nor does Lemmon's comic acting does not turn the film into a silly dainty rompy comedy although all of the cast are at the top of their form... The acting styles of the characters are all so different, yet fall into place, and this is the GENIUS of the film... that such very different characters can fit into a story with such perfect coherence.  (NOTE -- I'm being vague so as not to spoil the story.)<br /><br />In addition to the incredible screenplay and well utilized ensemble, the editing and cinematography are so well done, time is suspended... over 2 hours, the film unfolds more like a thriller as we truly are pulled into the world of Wilder's dysfunctional love triangles.  The (then) contemporary setting of the story leaves the modern viewer with an added breathtaking and engaging view of cool, hip, swinging  NY circa 1959 and 1960), definitely making then film even stronger watched 50 years later.<br /><br />As another reviewer points out; however, in many ways the film is poorly marketed.  To describe the film as a \\"comedy\\" is somewhat deceptive.  A tragi-comedy perhaps... but then again, even that could be argued about.  In the end, what it is is a masterpiece that simply transcends all genres and effectively tells a powerfully engaging story. To this extent, I'd have to rank it as an all time favorite and would definitely recommend buying it (not renting it) as a keeper!making then film even stronger watched 50 years later.

B0045HCJR6|5.0|Its all good i liked what came no damage product was what it was suppose to be. Repeat customer for sure
B004I8WD6E|4.0|As others have stated, the only drawback for me was that it cannot dock in the case, so I may have to replace it unless my work situation changes (hope hope). However, that being said, have you SHOPPED for cases recently? Lordy, its crazy! This case shows off my white 4s beautifully! It's more than great for the price. I have issues getting the screen protector on without an inevitable piece of lint causing a bubble, but that's my issue. If you want a sturdy, low price great looking piece of protection for your iPhone and docking isn't a deal-breaker, this case is perfection.

B000FVQM2Y|3.0|Brick is a stylish modern day noir which uniquely uses high school students as its main stars (although students aren't exactly going to class that much). Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) begins his quest to discover the whys of his ex-girlfriend's death.  The film begins with him receiving a mysterious call from Emily, her stating that she is \\"in trouble.\\" Snooping around, and enlisting his friend Brain for clues, Brendan encounters some shady types around the high school as he gets closer to the darker truth of her end, and becomes involved in a dangerous drug world.   While I loved the attempt to make this a modern day noir, somehow it just didn't work that well. For one, although the rhythm of the dialogue is quick, face-paced, and snappy, it seems like the characters are just saying lines rather than really acting. They keep the mood of a hard-broiled noir intact, but the dialogue is devoid of any real meaning. Secondly, half the time you can't understand what the characters are saying. Even with subtitles, the lingo is just way too over the top and distracting (one reviewer said it best, sort of \\"hipster noir\\"....i.e. \\"I've got knives in my eyes.\\" translation: \\"I have a bad headache.\\")Even as homage to noir, the dialogue goes around in circles without really making any sense or having much power. Finally, it takes way too long for this story to get going, and the 110 minutes for the amount of \\"real story\\" is way too long. It was painstaking to wait for key plot events to surface, and mysteries to be unraveled. When it finally does get going with Brendan encountering various thugs and bad dudes , the story does get more interesting, but it need not take that long to get there.   I really liked the effort that Brick makes to be a fresh take on the noir film, but over all, it was just so-so.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very good graphics, some what poor speed, should be an add-free version. great game overall it is all the challange and fun a game needs.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are not bad especially for being free. they were kind of hard but hey its a lot of games and completely free so you cant beat that.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so cool there are fun games you can play and its not just one game so you don't get bored
1451648537|5.0|I'm not a die-hard fan of Apple's products (I merely use iPod & iTune), yet I found Walter Isaacson's 'Steve Jobs' fascinating. In 2006, a friend recommended Jobs' 2005 Standford commencement  speech: \\"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future... Stay hungry. Stay foolish...\\" I have revisited the speech few times over the years & consider Jobs (through this particular speech) one of the key influencers of my personal philosophy.<br />The book enables me to gain a holistic view of Jobs, both his dark and bright sides. It also illustrates vividly how Jobs transformed various industries. After finishing the engaging book, I feel blue & wonder how the world would evolve in the coming decades if he is still alive.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|You have endless opportunities to gain points. You can play your favorite game over and over to try to out do yourself. A must try
B005M2A4D4|5.0|This season is wonderful. Obviously. Oddly, the packaging on the 5th and 6th series is different from before. Instead of folding out, the discs are in a stack, with their plastic tray things held together by a clear sticker on one side, like a book. I was confused because if you take the sticker off, won't everything just fall apart?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is fun though the rewards could be smaller and the games could be cheaper. I like Serpent, but it would be easier if you got arrows to change the direction of your serpent. The first airplane one (sorry, I forgot the name) could be a bit easier. :)  That's all. Other than that, it was pretty good. x3
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not going to write a long and detailed review.  I'm just going to say that I absolutley loved this ENTIRE series. Once you start reading it is nearly impossible to stop! Collins did an excellent job and I would strongly recommend all 3 books to others.<br /><br />MUST READ!
0439023491|5.0|I don't even know where to begin with this book. Along with the first one it is AMAZING! I recommend having the 3rd book on hand while reading this, you will want to continue immediately!
B006BQI1V2|5.0|This is a powerful movie.  For those who don't like subtitles, don't worry...you won't even notice (it's only partially subtitled)  Lots of emotion, history and a great story based on reality of the 40's
B00164GDD2|5.0|it was a grand old movie with a great cast and fun for the whole family...don't know of anyone who wouldn't enjoy this all time great movie, DO YOU ??????? By the way it was at an awesome price to boot !!!!!

B0063GORYU|4.0|Don't always like the choices the game makes, but overall good. Easy to use setting and placement of restart button.
B000FC130E|5.0|I really wish this was a series, I so want to follow Door and Richard around forever. I loved this book! I felt like I was in London while reading it, and I've never even been, so that was a magical  experience for me. Mr. Gaiman is amazing and I love his work so much.

0553801473|2.0|ADWD: dissappointing, just like AFFC.<br /><br />First three books: excellent. A classic work in the making. The last two books: not so great.<br /><br />Too bad we have to conclude now GRRM messed up. The first three books were published within a five year period. The last two books took 11 years to get done. This says enough about the lack of focus, lack of motivation, lack of ideas, lack of inspiration GRRM must have fallen victim to.<br /><br />Or maybe he got blinded by his own Greatness? These last two books do not seem to be edited at all - were there actual editors used or are they afraid of GRRM? These last two books should have and could have been combined into one 1000 page book, which might have been OK then. Now we have too much repetition (food descriptions, travelogue, words are wind, little and less, much and more, where do whores go, etc.) too much predictable cliffhangers, useless characters and pointless storylines and the worst: very dissapointing development of the series favorites - John who takes inventory for 500 pages and then does something complete out of character before he gets cliffhangered, Dany who is now a wining baby in stead of the strong woman she could have grown into too and Tyrion... useless.<br /><br />Two stars for the storylines of Theon and Davos; who at least show us what's happening in the place we care about: Westeros.<br /><br />Unfortunately GRRM can not unwrite these last two books, and I can not unread them. The ASOIAF series could have been classic if (ever) finished, when the standard of the first three books was maintained. Well, that is not the case. The decision to split and then bloat the last two books has proven to be catastrophic. \\"Three bitches and a bastard\\" it was for GRRM to write this book. Well, the reading experience was likewise.<br /><br />I am done with these series.<br /><br />PS. What's with all these bogus 5 star reviews? (Great book, great series, arrived in great condition!) All one line reviews that give no arguments at all, but only seem to serve to let the average rating not fall too low?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this app and my kids love it even more.  Fun quick games that help pass time.  There are games that you earn more points so if you want to unlock more games you end up playing those over and over again..
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Great device, connects under 15 seconds and stay locked on. The magnetic bottom clamps pretty well to the outside of a car. Great purchase!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|DVD \\"Lion King\\" was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  Gift was received in a very timely manner.  No problems and appreciate the excellent delivery service.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|An album very diferent from the other ones. Full of Intimist atmosphere for the ones who likes to discover, on each audition, this new Dido.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I purchased this watch to use while running.  I liked the fact that it includes a GPS, but also can be paired with an optional foot pod (sold separately) to track distance/pace while running inside.  It also came with a heart rate monitor and a USB stick that allows you to upload all of your training data to Garmin Connect.  I wasn't sure I would use this feature, but after trying it out, it is nice to be able to see all of your workout history and compare things like pace, elevation, heartrate, etc.  Overall, I would say this watch does everything it claims and includes some extras I didn't expect.  My only complaint...I don't think the navigation is very intuitive.  The bezel of the watch controls the navigation and it's a little difficult to manuver at times.  Gloves certainly don't help, but even without it's a little touchy.  Overall...I'm figuring it out, but it's definitely not something you'll be able to turn on and figure out without reading the instructions.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is one of the most original, captivating, and addictive games I have ever encountered...and I mean that in a GREAT way! Excellent gameplay and absolutely gorgeous artistically. Most definitely in my top five ever!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this game. My sister will steal my fire and I will find her an hour later playing it somewhere, hiding. Get this app. You will love it.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I am only writing this to get the companies attention. I have heard great things about this application and I would love to try it, but the website doesn't load on any computer I've tried. I would really like to change my review score to something higher, so please make the website work.
0307943194|5.0|This was a fun book to read.  I was glad that Grisham is off his anti death penalty kick. This is a real story, about real people with strengths and weakness who do both wise and unwise things.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Simply great...works wonders over VZW 4gLTE on my HTC Thunderbolt. I tried playing music files from my computer over Splashtop, and it sounded great!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it. awesome game no errors only 2-3 games I didn't like. Great for young or old people. And it is no joke there are 117 games total.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evermore is a good app with really good quality. The reason I only gave it four stars was because of the layout but otherwise great app!

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Amazon's Silk browser is the slowest I've ever had the displeasure of using. Splashtop makes browsing enjoyable on the Fire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun games, but some are hard to control and play. After you get the hang of them, it gets easier.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's a very addicting game, it's perfect for anyone with ADD.  Most times I get bored pretty quickly in games but I love that I don't have to play the ones I don't like.  I also like that you can gain more points by playing games you've already passed.
4789009637|5.0|Thank you, Nancy, for the Japanese book; it's in perfect condition and I can't wait to start learning Japanese by using this book for my class!! This was a much better bargain than NKU Bookstore.
0385523912|5.0|A haunting, unforgettable book chockful of intimate details of the lives of real North Koreans.  Ms. Demick is a wonderful writer and this is a real page turner.  Throughout the book, I reminded myself of how precious freedom is and the many blessings I have as an American.  It is painful to know of the suffering of North Koreans.  Pray that their nightmare will soon end.
B003B96AOW|5.0|This is an excellent figure. Probably should have kept it in the package. It is really articulate and fully posable.
B000063Y8F|5.0|It's been years sense I've owned a garlic press because I hated cleaning them.  I decided this holiday that it was time to get back to pressing so I bought this one.  GREAT CHOICE!!  Pros:  Total stainless steel construction.  No rusting.  I'm a man with fairly strong hands and it's easy enough to use.  I can't confirm that it would be just as easy for a woman.  I would think, however, that if you keep the cloves small or cut the bigger ones in half it should be easy enough for most women to use.  The hinge system makes it really easy to remove the husks if you press the cloves with the husks on.  Easy to clean.  The reason I never bought another press is that I found them way too hard to clean.  All of those tiny holes, trying to poke them clean with a fork or toothpick - Ugh!!  This one has no tool with tines to break while trying to align them with the little holes. Instead, all of the parts separate on three central hinges allowing you to run hot water over and through all the parts.  Two minutes to completely clean.  Cons:  None
B005ZUR724|5.0|This is a really great mmorpg, i love the fact that its so much like WoW  This is a great deal for .99, the only regret i have is not getting it sooner.

B00009RDGA|5.0|After \\"The last picture show\\", Bodganovich made an impressive back with this tender and brilliant masterwork.<br /><br />These are hard times is the slogan that the screen writer puts into the mouth of three different characters all along the film. Bodganovich, with his elegant and refined style gives a kiss on the cheek to these times of the Great depression through a very well elaborated script which conjugates tenderenss, humor and witty refelctions about the future of these two human beings united by these random circumstances.<br /><br />Tatum O'Neal steals the movie giving - until that date - the most impressive performance by a child actor on screen since Brigitte Fossey in \\"Forbidden games\\"<br /><br />Don't miss this legendary masterpiece of a North American style absolutely vanished in these times.

B0059XTTW8|4.0|if you are watching this film for the characterizations, the period, the overall theme and so forth, like I was, then you will like this.  if you are solely watching for plot, which many people who watch spy movies do, then you might not.  it is a very convoluted plot and very compressed to fit within the time frame. basically, when george smiley (gary oldman), a senior spymaster, is thrown out of British Intelligence because of an operation gone wrong, there is no doubt in my mind that he will be back, that he will figure out everything. essentially he has to find the mole in British Intelligence (very loosely based on spy Kim Philbin from this Cold War era, who did end up relocated in Russia).<br /><br />what i was enjoying was the performance Gary Oldman was giving.  I would imagine this is the way a spy really is.  They are not at all glamorous.  They were nerdy and studious in school. They got used to spending time alone and that has never changed. They are nondescript and almost fade back into the wallpaper or paint in a room. most importantly, they are always thinking. and thinking.  and thinking.  watching too of course but thinking out moves in their heads and going backwards and forwards with different permutations.  it may take them awhile to speak because they have to have thought something through before they have anything to say.  gary oldman captures this perfectly.  he is a late middle age spy and he has survived that long because he is very careful and very thoughtful. he does have a gun but it is something he takes out only when strictly necessary and it is the only logical choice left.<br /><br />i did see the late alec guinness's performance as this same character. this is a tough choice.  they are both great actors. i would probably give the edge to Oldman. He especially has the voice down perfectly, just the most casual, laid back, milquetoast voice imaginable.<br /><br />the rest of the production and actors are all quite good.  however, the main virtue to the show is Gary Oldman.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000E9910W|5.0|I purchased this CD to be a Christmas present for a friend of mine. I had run into this friend at a Doobie Brothers concert this past summer and she had a great time at the show. When she opened the present from me and saw the CD she chuckled and smiled. I knew I had made the right choice.
B005URRCUY|5.0|The Black Keys keep outdoing themselves.  You hate for one song to end, but each next song makes you forget that.  I love the sixties elements that they incorporate in their sound.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game so much! Its so addicting and so much fun! It works great on the kindle fire! Its so addicting! My personal best is 185 on the classic mode! I totally suggest. this game! You will love it! Its for all genders and ages too because I'm a 13 year old girl and like I said before I love it!( and by the way my name is not Samuel that's my dads name he put my kindle under his name so yea just in case your wondering.)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice game fun time waster this game can get you fired from work and I ran out of words to say for he mnimum words thingu
B000VWH0E6|5.0|The songs are even tighter now than they were on \\"Awake,\\" including the solos. But what stands out on this record are Sully's vocal hooks! On tracks like \\"Make Me Believe,\\" he makes the tracks his with beautiful singing during the breakdown, and elsewhere - the Awake-ish \\"I Am\\" and the peaceful \\"Serenity\\" - he shows that his vocals are not to be underestimated. If you want to hear Sully both shriek to great effect - \\"Changes\\" and \\"I F****** Hate You\\" - and belt out great harmonies/melodies, then pick this one up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so cool. it has plenty of games to play. P.S. if you rate this game you get 250,000 points
B0026P3G12|4.0|I am happy with the I Dreamed A Dream cd.  It has been a good product.  Good service...quick shipping.  I would order again.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have a polaroid internet tablet. not the best, but this app works great. my mom was complaining bout how to get her files onto he tablet. i told her to use her usb plug, but this is even better. plus, it is easy to set up. it does cost $5 but it is compltely worth it. (even though i got it as a free app of the day). anyways, BUY IT!!!
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Considering I paid $32 shipped with my Amazon Prime account, this is probably the best deal I have ever got on a Blu-Ray purchase. This set is worth buying for ALIEN alone. The print is absolutely phenomenal, words fail how amazing that particular print is. As someone with a fairly extensive Blu-Ray collection I can say that is probably the best looking one I own out of any other films. I grew up watching these films (the original trilogy) and getting to see them all together at their absolute best really shows you how far superior Ridley Scott's original is to everything else. The extras on these disks are so abundant, I will be watching them for weeks to come. If you were one of those kids who was scared to $H!* by the original ALIEN saga and if you own a Blu-Ray player, you are doing yourself a huge disservice not purchasing this set. I thought I had seen the true power of Blu-Ray until I bought this. Buy it...never look back....cuz there's a Xenomorph behind you....
B0052UZIFA|3.0|My kids n I love this game...until it started shutting off the phone. Now I can't even get it 2 load. I'd reinstall it but don't wanna pay 4 it twice. Plz fix this problem asap!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great game for having fun. with many games to choose, it is hard to be bored of the games.  I wish they would give us more games at the start and no ads, which is kind of annoying since they randomly pop up.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a cute game to play when you are bored. Same games that you find on the computer games though.
B005FITIGO|5.0|I am not sure if one needs to be in the investment industry (as I am), or older and having experience with management, corporate decision making (which I am and have LOL) to fully enjoy the depth of this film. The dialog is outstanding. Very interesting watching upper management only care about the company and themselves. The continued success and \\"got mine\\" of those in charge, or supplied with wonderful parachute type packages is semi shocking and norm for upper management officers. Our economic disaster of 2008-2010 is presented in its most naked form via this film as to USA corporate banks. They/we bundled mortgage related products with lower ratings B, BB, BBB, A or even C ratings, coupled with a mathmatical formula the said the odds of them all failing was nearly impossible. So the products got AAA ratings by Moodys and S&P !!!!. Then the banking firms sold trillions to each other, who then borrowed trillions from other firms using these AAA rated products as collaterical.. Then the products freaking failed as housing collapased/jobs lost and people could not pay their mortgages!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />We damn near destroyed the entire economic world....<br />Gotta love this film although skirts the true harm of what we did. But presents a fantastic insight into how the corporate profit at all cost world really works; Got Mine, Keep My Job, Make Money, hope I am not fired..... And as you get older (like me), you pray, you can keep your health care benefits LOL..... I watched it twice over a week. A first for me, and even enjoyed it a little more the 2nd time. \\"First out the Door, that is not panic\\".... Classic line. Really means, you saw the disaster coming first, got out, how can that be panic? LOL...<br />Cheers<br />David
B004O3YGMC|4.0|As suggested by the title, Splashtop works perfectly except for one small detail particular to my PC setup.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|My son loves this game. he is motivated by the opportunity to win points and buy additional games. Try it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it but it is a little hard but once you keep playing you get the hang of it :) the -1star was because I got mad because I couldn't pass a level...
0307593312|3.0|I value Mr. Murakami's literature very highly and really enjoyed Kafka on the Shore.  I waited for 1Q84 in English translation for a long time as many of my friends had read and highly recommended it.  I must say I really liked it, probably up to the last 100 pages or so. There are very intriguing layers and introducing Ushikawa in the third book adds another flavor to the story.  As usual, Mr. Murakami weaves interesting and unusual subjects in his unique way, neither science fiction or dystopia, but with very engaging and suspenseful mysteries.  My discontent is that this is a kind of book that you read with great anticipation to see how all these things come together in the end, and the ending was heartbreakingly disappointing to me, too simple, too romance-like, fizzling.....with too unfinished...perhaps the author deliberately did it with the intent to write book 4...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best thing ever to be put to print. wow the greatest off all. why so many words, for this hope and love is all u need.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|game not bad kids like it keeps them entertained for awhile at least its free I played it for awhile got lots of points yeahhh lol
B004RJMUJO|4.0|One of the few games I haven't gotten sick of playing. Excellent, simple, elegant concept. Well executed. A rare infinitely playable game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game isn't going to wow u with graphics or even gameplay, but if your stuck waiting for your wife in the shoe department, or sitting in a lobby waiting on a doctor or similar situation this game is perfect.  4 stars...Just can't give 5 stars to a game that appears to have been made in the early 80's.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|What a great movie! Highly recommend it for the whole family.  The blu ray provides a super clear and clean picture, and added to the DTS sound that comes out all around you, a wonderful movie experience!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|My only regret is that I paid for the app, but it's still worth it. If you want to connect to your computer through your tablet,  this is THE app. I use this on my iPad all the time for controlling my desktop from bed or when I'm around town. Also use as a remote for my HTPC. Awesome. Get it while it's free!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this ap is exactly what I need to be truly free from my Pc! it works great on my kindle fire and now I don't have to consider packing the laptop or emailing docs to myself. I also use my Pc web for certain applications due to the larger viewing area than the kindle web browser. and checking my email works so much better than the kindle email functions as well. this makes me love my kindle fire even more!!
B005HS00V4|5.0|Saw this in the theater, was blown away! I have been a fan for 30 years, but this was breath taking. The reviewer who said he was disappointed has no taste. This just shows how much more talented he is, to bring his songs to a whole new level. I felt like I was watching another soprano, his voice soars!  Forgetabout it! Phenomenal!
B005HSL626|1.0|I understand ad supported aps, but this one is over the top annoying. I deleted it from my device in the first ten minutes.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Great improvement over default kindle pdf reader. Bottom line if your planning to use pdf files on your kindle then is a must have app.
B005KXT58U|5.0|This album can definitely be considered rock, branching out a bit from Evanescence's normal feel. Being a huge fan of rock myself, I listened to previews of all the songs on this self-titled album and found it to my liking. With a $3.99 price tag (MP3 Deal of the Day) it was an instant buy, and I don't regret it one bit after listening to the album several times over. It reminds me of Daughtry's first (and also self-titled) album, only with a female lead singer instead of a male one. And that's good!  For reference, see Daughtry's first album \\"Daughtry\\" [[ASIN:B0013JWO7Y here]].
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I reall have enjoyed this Christmas CD. Michael Buble has a classic smooth voice and he does these songs justice.
B006RED4GA|4.0|After waiting nearly two years, Ti West's follow-up to his critically acclaimed genre masterpiece, \\"The House of the Devil\\", is finally here. Giddy with excitement like a child ready to rip open his biggest Christmas present, my expectations were sky high. The movie just had to be a masterpiece, it had to be a unique, one-of-a-kind thriller, and it had to be perfect. I am one of the horror faithfuls that believes that \\"House of the Devil\\" is THE best horror movie of the last decade and this movie had better come close to that sort of greatness. Does \\"The Innkeepers\\" reach those lofty heights or does it vanish into thin air like the ghosts it portrays?<br /><br />\\"The Innkeepers\\" tells the story of The Yankee Pedlar Inn. After over one hundred years of service, The Yankee Pedlar Inn is shutting its doors for good. The last remaining employees -Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) - are determined to uncover proof of what many believe to be one of New England's most haunted hotels. As the Inn¹s final days draw near, odd guests check in as the pair of minimum wage ghosthunters begin to experience strange and alarming events that may ultimately cause them to be mere footnotes in the hotel¹s long unexplained history. Along with them for the ride is a actress turned psychic who may know more than she lets on and an old man who will stay in nothing less than the Honeymoon Suite and may have a connection the a devastating murder that took place years before.<br /><br />\\"The Innkeepers\\" is terrifically moody with some of the best cinematography I've seen in a movie in a long time. The Inn comes alive in a fresh way that never feels phony or cheap. The actors are also quite good, particularly Paxton as Claire who is headstrong and determined but also has a shy, vulnerable side. The being said, the movie is a lot a buildup for a conclusion that seems fairly ho-hum. I know people bashed HOTD for the same thing but the ending here seems both too delayed as well as rushed, if such a thing is possible. It all just plays kind of false and lessens the stylish chills of the film's first two acts. I don't want it to seem as if I didn't enjoy this movie. I liked it, in fact I liked it a lot. Maybe it was my fault holding this film up to an impossible standard that no film could possibly live up to. HOTD was a masterpiece, this one is a pretty good thriller. Nonetheless, in today's horror market, pretty good is definitely good enough. Just keep your expectations in check. 3.5 out of 5possible.

B001P9EQH8|4.0|I ordered this amp for my dad to use with his Sony TV. The TV has no headphone jack, so we are using the audio out jacks which are preamp. This little, it is tiny, smaller than I thought, amp works to boost the volume more than enough to listen with headphones. There is a little bit of hiss, but not an annoying amount.
B0061S073A|5.0|My children, ages 3 and 5 use my kindle fire so this app is great!  They can even watch Netflix but not get on the Internet.  It keeps all their games and stories in one place and they can't get into mine.  I am so glad I found this!

B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is an awesome app for the droid. To really test this app out I decided to run Star Wars The Old Republic mmorpg on my asus transformer and it was beautiful. It was as though i was in front of my desk with some lag. But i will not ding for lag because hey i had full control of my main comp. just remember to have to app on your mac or pc before setting this up. If so it will pick up your comp like my did with out missing a beat.
0374275637|5.0|this is one of the most insightful explacations i have ever read in neuroscience. it is not only helpful to me personally but is strongly recommended for professionals.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is legit its fun and pretty tricky at the same time don't like that you have to unlock some of the games but that's okay makes it.more difficult
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is pretty good, the games are like arcade games and are really basic. really good for time wasting.
B005VTGB0S|5.0|I prefer this kind of case because it provides protection for both the front and back of the iPad. In addition, the iPad can be propped up in three angles/positions for viewing.<br /><br />There are generally two types of folio cases for the iPad: Adjustable Tilt (AT) and Fold Back (FB)<br /><br />This AmazonBasics is the kind that has a adjustable tilt (3 positions) and a large base to form a very stable platform for viewing. Furthermore, the inside surface, which is made of felt-like material, never contacts the outside surface (for example, a dirty tabletop) when the case is propped up, so it is easy to keep the case and the iPad clean.<br /><br />The second kind of case has a cover that can be folded back (FB) to form a triangular shape stand. Its construction is simpler and the case is more compact. However, this latter kind of case has three disadvantages: unstable base (only 1/3 to 1/4 of the surface contact area of the AT type when in the more upright mode), only two viewing angles, and the clean inside surface of the case will touch the outside when the case is propped up.<br /><br />This AmazonBasics case uses four elastic bands in the corners to securely hold the iPad in place. The case is slightly larger than the iPad, so it can protect the tablet against light bumps. There is another elastic band that runs the length of the folio case which you can use to keep the two halves of the case together when transporting the tablet.<br /><br />I like this AmazonBasics Leather Folio case because it is a more superior and versatile design, well-made, and priced very reasonably when compared to others.

B000E1MXSW|3.0|The Nun's Story lost 8 to 0 against William Wyler's Ben Hur during the 1959 Academy awards ceremony. No problemo, God was the winner after all. Curious how In both films, we also have a long scene with lepers but, in the Nun's Story, our Lord didn't make a miracle and allowed a devoted doctor to catch the disease. That's the whole difference between a blockbuster doomed to meet the larger possible audience and a film directed by an auteur (I didn't say that William Wyler wasn't an auteur). Recommended.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|Well, of course this worked perfectly with my stepdad's ipad2, but it is an apple product after all :) We only used the HDMI side. You do have to buy the HDMI cable to link to the TV separately.
B00139W3NE|1.0|I didn't read the book and am not familiar with the author, so all I can do is comment on what I did see. What I saw was not impressive. I wanted to like it. I like flights of fancy, but it was pretty juvenile. I think if you are to get swept up in fantasy, you have to be able to suspend reality. This did not do that for me. I didn't like that everyone had their own demon. That was a major turn off. I just never got drawn into the plot or the characters. Not sure why. This type of movie usually speaks to me. It is visually pretty, but not stunning. The acting was okay, I guess. I just found it all boring. The story was slow and never took off.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Ok... I must say I was a little leary about reading this book. Don't ask me why. But it was free & promised to reference my beloved Avett Brothers. It started out good enough but I was waiting for something to really hook me. AND THEN IT DID! I didn't see it coming, but this book has a great plot to it. I couldn't put it down. I loved it & have already recommended it to a friend who immediately went home to download it. I look forward to reading more from this author!!
B0029QRA1U|5.0|This Item Works great! This item is a great buy and a very easy way to transfer records to MP3's. It has an AUX RCA out and a usb out, i beleive the only downside to this is that the rca cord is short, and would recomend buying an extensive rca cord... Overall I would recomend this to anyone looking for a decent record player!<br /><br />Update 8 months later: I use this alot and it's still in great, working condition! One defect is that if you, instead of picking the needle up yourself or letting it automatically stop, press the \\"Stop\\" button, for about 5 times afterwards (altough this doesn't happen EVERY time) as soon as you pick the needle up it automaticaly rejects and jerks back to its resting place. Still worth the money though!

B00000JBFW|5.0|Deep Purple made a comeback in 1984 with Perfect Strangers.  This album is one of my favorites from them.  The classic lineup of Ian Gillan, Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Paice, Jon Lord, and Roger Glover returned for this gem of an album.  The album rocks with songs such as the title track, Knocking At Your Back Door, Wasted Sunsets, I'm Not Responsible, Under The Gun, and Gypsy's Kiss.  I listened to this album a lot soon after its release and still play it once in a while today.  Highly recommended to all Deep Purple fans.
0545403359|5.0|This was a really enjoyable and sentimental story. I was really impressed with the storytelling and the long journey of a boy and his horse, Joey, his best friend in the world. I saw the movie on tuesday and found it to be accurate to the book and a beautiful and detailed look at war and friendship. The book was really good and showed Joey's journey and his perspective on everything that was going on during the war and also the people and other horses he befriended. This was a really interesting story with wonderful characters and it is something that will inspire a lot of people who read this book or see the movie.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|My Kinect is mounted above my TV.  I saw this product a while ago, and was really excited for it to come out. I had just gotten some new Kinect games from Christmas, and realized that the farthest point I can stand in my room barely makes it into the Kinect's \\"O.K.\\" distance. I remembered seeing this and then found it on here. As I was looking through the reviews, I thought to myself \\"Eh, I'll try it. If it doesn't work, then I'll just it send back, no problem!\\" I ordered and when it came in the mail, I set it up right away. I was a little disappointed by the amount of space I saved, only a measly 5 or 6 inches, but at least it was better than before. I first played Kinect Sports: Season 2, and it was working fine at first. The hand tracking and navigation was working fine, as was the body tracking. I then switched over to Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2012, and I couldn't even pick my save device. The hand tracking had become extremely jumpy and sometimes not show up at all! At first I though it was the game, so I switched back to Kinect Sports 2, and it was stilll happening. I read the review about it working better below the TV, so I moved my Kinect, and it started working for another 10 minutes. After that, it went back to being jumpy. I tried re-calibrating, but that was no help. I promptly put everything back in the box, and sent it back to Amazon for a refund. I would never recommend this product, it is a waste of time and a complete hassle trying to troubleshoot why it isn't working.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a ok game you can get lots of stuff and the games are awesome I think feel its great
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Very cool in that you can directly connected from a phone or tablet without having to VPN or open up firewall ports.  Love the find by Email feature too.   However, the screen is terribly fuzzy when zooming and I found it impossible to type, at least in a Chrome address bar.   Still, a great product and 5 stars if those bugs are fixed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my opinion of the app is its a fun app and great for any ages. its just a fun app
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This really is the best Bible app! The price is FREE and you receive so much. Whether you are new to the Bible, or been reading it for years, you will  love this app.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|It does everything it claims to do, but much faster, easier, and better than you would expect. This is a \\"must have\\" for owners of the Kindle Fire!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love every single one of these games!!!! They can be addicting though. I mean you constantly have to earn points in order be able to play more games. All in all I think its a great thing to let a kid play on this app because in my opiln it will keep them busy for hours.

B004RJMUJO|5.0|addicting and fun and pretty easy too! sooo creative and love EVERYTHING about it!! wow! that's one of the only games I play on my kindle fire!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am dealt just doing this to get a lot of points but this game is not very bad, and I would reccomend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good, some of the games are realy hard. it is a very fun game though. and it is decent game ok, and pretty fun.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very fun little game. Although not too challenging, still requires a little bit of thinking. Would recommend. Very smooth game play, as well.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this game was a game and the gameplay was very gameplayish. it seems like it is a game about games for gamers. a game is something you can play. that is all.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|What an incredible movie , it did the book justice and more , of course the books are better but it would take a 10 hour movie to make them exact . This movie was great , the acting was great , and the battle of hog warts was epic !! I would recommend this movie to anyone (Harry potter fan or not )
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game. I will totally recommend this to all of my friends. Everyone should have this app on their devices. (:
B005KELR3A|1.0|Not even close in size for my Kindle, returned.  Incorrectly described.  Who ever said it would work, obviously never tried it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is super addicting!!! I play this game nonstop. a big reason I'm doing this review is for the coins I get for doing it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this so far. I've only tried it on my home WiFi and I am waiting to see how it does over 3G and 4G.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|This really is a great combo of action film from the very start. The high definition sure makes a big difference. I reccommend this to all my friends. Service by Amazon was great, and the price was fantastic.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game i love it. Omg great game:) some of the games are hard though. i can not get pass a lot of the games
B005IZLPMY|5.0|If you saw Captain America at the movies, you'll love the blue ray, high definition movie. Great film with excellent cast. Watch the extra features to learn more about Cap. My brother and I just watch it and were amazed at the quality of the film, the great action, and the suspenseful ending. Get it at Amazon for a great price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app. It has a good variety of games and they have all been fun. The only negative is that some of the games are difficult to control with your finger. But if you use the very tip of your finger or your nail, it goes a little more smoothly. Overall a good game for wasting time.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|Really a fantastic film, especially in high definition. If you have not seen it yet, buy the high definition, not the regular dvd. You'll be amazed at the quality of the film. Great prices at Amazon, quick delivery.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|The game will launch on ICS but will not play further than that. it just locks up and I have to force stop the app
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|Wow! I finally got my Predators high definition movie. I was waiting for it because I had just seen Predator 2 in high definition and wanted to experience the same with Predators. The cast was excellent in Predators, just as it had been in Predator with Arnold and the rest. The difference is that it happens off-world, and the Predators are not the only bad guys there. You have to watch it to appreciate it. Amazon has it at great prices.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|I saw these guys open for Eric Church at Joe's Bar in Chicago several years ago.  There first CD was awesome and this one is even better. I hope they stay together and keep jamming, they are a great find.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love this!  I was always miffed at hulu for not allowing their site on mobile devices unless you subscribe.  To me it doesn't make any difference if I watch it on the web or on my kindle.  But to get it on your kindle, you have to subscribe to huluplus.  Sorry, I'm not going to pay for a subscription and still have to watch ads.  This app solves that quandry quite easily.  I can watch me some hulu anytime, anywhere (as long as I have wifi) and that makes me a happy camper.  Setup was only the teensiest bit confusing, but really simple.  (they could do a better job explaining the security code autopopulating if you already have a google account registered).  It really does control your computer which is just cool in itself.  I haven't delved into all the other stuff, but I do have a rather large collection of movies on my computer that i'd like to watch on my kindle.. and this lets me do that (without having to fuss with uploading to amazon's cloud which would be eaten by only a few movies anyway).  Cloud is great for music files, but not the bigger ones.   And i imagine it will come in handy for accessing files... like retrieving my resume or emailing it though I wont be doing too much of that.    It's the perfect APP for me!  I got this on the free app of the day, but it is well worth $4.99.  Also, if you are like me, checking in on your favorite facebook game to do some 'maintenance' is plus!
B003L77G8I|5.0|There\\"s not much I can say about Bones that other reviewers with far better talents than I haven't already said. I have purchased all the season dvd's. 1 thru 6. The chemistry between Dr. Temperance Brennan and FBI agent Seeley Booth is perfect. The on-going will they ? Are wont they? Is a perfect addition to the mix of Murder, mystery, and forensic  science. The writers do a superb job of keeping you guessing on all aspects of the main characters lives. Their professional and their private quirks, how they complement or detract on their job performance. The story lines are always entertaining. Will definitely purchase season 7 when it becomes available.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a beautiful story. Well written and creative ... I enjoyed everything about this book and am looking forward to future works by this author.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. Lots of fun. No issues so far. The adds could be less, but considering it was free, I'm certainly willing to overlook that.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Change begins with a whisper.  That is the tagline to the movie \\"The Help\\".  Watch it, if you haven't already.  It is a story to be carried in your heart.  The voice of change may begin as a whisper.  But change itself begins with a moment of bravery, an exhale of breath when you know that you may face hell itself when you take that next step.  Change doesn't happen until someone is brave enough to risk it all. Remember - 'You is kind.  You is smart.  You is important.\\"  And that's all you'll ever need.
B004SBX112|5.0|This app is a great time killer. Id love to see this on Xbox 360 with achievements! Or even just an Arcade version. Id pay $30 for this with its own game case and all the games plus an Xbox 360 only version with leaderboards and smartphone sync for highscores! Keep em coming. Thanx. __Chris from Lawrence, KS
B006BDHAX0|1.0|fun to play,  but too many bugs to enjoy playing. the app quits during play, and returns you to the home screen.  poor quality to have paid for this app.  I hope a new version is out soon
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so much fun. I have been playing for awhile now. some games are harder than other but that's what makes it a challenge.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|The only downside to reading this series is the look on people's faces after they ask you what's so funny, and you are forced to tell them, umm, a scene from \\"the IRON DRUID  Chronicles\\".  It is witty, comical, original, captivating and enlightening.  By the time you finish book 1, you will be secretly wishing that there is a part 2.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this thing is amazing! !!I cant believe I got it for free!!!!!!I very highly reccomend this!this is a definet get!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it has ok games I enjoy them and really love them for the price.  should have better instructions for a few games.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book.  I was born in 1958 and this book brought back so many wonderful memories of that time that I just could not get enough of it.  The book is so well written and the story is absolutely wonderful.  Steven King has been one of my favorite authors for many years and this is truly one of his best works.  The book is a real page turner.  I am not a avid reader, I find that most of the time, I just do not have the time to devote myself to a novel this large.  I can tell you that I could not put this down.  I finished the entire book in about a week and for me that is amazing.  I work a lot so there were many nights that I was  up until 1:00 AM just because I wanted to read what was going to happen next.    It is a love story with so many wonderful twists and turns that you can not help being drawn in.  I was a little saddened when it ended, I felt like I lost my friend.  If you have any fond memories of the 60's then this book is for you.  King really did his homework when he describes the cars, the music and the time that was.  I wish there were more books like this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good way to pass a couple free minutes Some games my five year old can play too Worth giving it a look
B004SGWYVA|5.0|HOTD, wow.  Okay HOTD really has a pretty good story.  I'll be honest, I really really was looking to critisise it, looking at the cover and the comments, I really just thought it was just boobs.  I found it hard to believe that the artist and his brother, the writer, whose a hentai artist, would be able to produce something thats meaningful or interesting.  I mean seriously, as much as we all really love boobs, its not worth it if all 12 episodes have no story.  I just thought it was zombies dying and boobs.  I WAS WRONG.  Story:(reason I would give this 5 stars)  The characters all complement each other well and each character goes through his or her own personal journey.  This first 12 episodes really helps slowly develop relations and define faults of each character.  It does this through serious and humorous tones.  All the episodes have a decent amount of zombie action but it slowly develops more(using the fact that more people get infected over time.)  Another strong point about this anime is that it focuses on the big picture.  It focuses on a societal collapse and what a country, or what humanity will do depending on the circumstances.  This is a strong strong point for me.  Though the characters are very interesting and I love them, I want to know what happens to the HOTD world as a whole.  Why things happen, what responses will occur, and what happens if they fail.  Very strong story.  Anime:  Since I'm a huge fan of Bandai, (Gundam, evangelion,) I read a lot of their mangas and watch a lot of their Animes.  First thing I noticed when I watched this was the quality of its animation.  Not saying that Bandai does bad anime, but this seems cleaner, CGI, perhaps I've been watching slightly older Gundam series recently so it might just be a matter of old and new.  However, its very clean, very nice.  I've always been more of a story guy so I don't really mind the quality but this is a good addition.  Intangibles:  Boobs, Boobs, Boobs.  Sometimes, its really too much, I get it that its there to keep a light tone in the story, and sometimes it works well.  But sometimes, it gets slightly distracting, especially the Nurse.  I find the rest okay because they tie in well to certain situations, but I guess I like Animes that are kind of serious and so it gets distracting.  However, it does really work well for some episodes and when its there on purpose, FANTASTIC.  The first time I saw the cover, I was extremely skeptical, firstly High school, secondly the drawings.  I had extreme doubts that this could surpass 3 stars and anything above 3 stars was because of boobs.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and I've been finding myself wanting more.  Thank you HOTD, you did a great job and in my opinion, found a strong balance between humor and serious-ness.  I can't wait for SEASON 2!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was at first scepticall but I'm so glad I got it. its soooooooo awesome, the only downside is ur computer must be on. set up takes 2 min :)
0756686970|5.0|My son is 7 and LOVES Star Wars and he LOVES this book!  And of course the little character that comes with it =)
0553386794|5.0|Many, many people have already reviewed this book and have rightly given it the great review it deserves. To this day, it remains one of my favorite books. Additionally, this book had a big impact on me for two reasons<br /><br />First, I believe it is a masterpiece of fantasy literature. It took a genre (which I enjoy) that was starting to become stale and full of repetitive plots and Tolkien copycats. It reoriented the genre in a much mature, nuanced, adult direction, breathing fresh vigor into the genre. It is also more historically inspired as opposed to the more mythological inspired works of much of the genre.<br /><br />Secondly, this book and series is a masterpiece of psychology and a great study in the motives and hearts of individuals. It is really comparable in this sense with \\"War and Peace\\" and the \\"Brothers Karamazov.\\" Some people here have complained that the book is not linear, there is no clear good and evil, the plot not strong, and so on. True- this book is a mishmash of perspectives, but that is a good thing. No mindless orcs. As Davos says in the second book, most men are shades of grey. To use the common literary analogy of the hedgehog and the fox, this book is a fox, in that it captures the true complexity of life.<br /><br />These are two very good reasons that this book is a classic of literature. I hope it is read and taught in schools in the future. All that aside, it is a very interesting story and GRRM is an excellent writer.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I really like this app a lot.  I was a little worried about which office app was the better choice between this and Quickoffice Pro.  The description Amazon leaves does not give it full justice.  For example it does allow you to create powerpoints and also allows you to use other remote cloud sites like Google docs, Box, and Dropbox.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the best game ever&iexcl;!!!!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!!!!!! I love it because it downy take up to much space an you still get tons if games
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is really fun. It engages the brain while still remaining entertaining. I recommend this if you already play or would like to start.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|For a free game its pretty awesome.  Seems like it'll last awhile and the games are all different so, I won't get bored.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This helps keep my mind in the right place with plans and many ways to read it. Especially helpful for teens (believe me, I'm only 14).
B000002ITW|5.0|I really liked this cd and gave it 5 stars for the 2nd disc. The long live jams are worth a reasonable price. I would like hear more of them.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works great on my galaxy nexus. Can't wait to get a tablet to try this out on! Best free app of the day ever!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app works great! I'm just not sure when I would use it. My phone already does pretty much everything that my computer does. I was able to watch some movies that I have on my computer, but I already have the Netflix, playon and tons of other apps that basically give me access to pretty much everything i need, so I'm not sure how often I'll use it, if ever. But its good to know that if I ever need to access my computer when I'm away from home, now I can! Thanks Splashtop and Amazon!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The best remote I have ever used.  the easiest to configure as well. An absolute must have ap. Hats off to the makers of this jewel.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Love the layout and navigation of this app.  Unfortunately it freezes when using the radar occasionally.  Requires a hard reset on the Fire.
B005PW3OS8|1.0|I didn't like this movie at all. It seemed like the whole movie I was waiting for it to start and then it just ended. No action, seemed not well thought out. I would not watch Part 2, if there ever was one. I wouldn't waste my money on renting it.
1905492073|5.0|This is an excellent book to help wrap up your diving knowledge. It \\"IS\\" the definitive book for information on DECO.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|had used swype for about a year and got tired of it constantly guessing wrong words, then when I pulled up other suggestions it still was no where near the word I intended. I'll be sticking with SwiftKey, the word prediction is amazing and most of the time it is correct without me having to back up and fix everything!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like how the games don't take too much time and there's lots of options! keeps me busy in the waiting room and when I'm bored
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I'm a big fan of the show, \\"Castle\\", so that was the draw for me.  But as I read, the only benefit of watching the show was to give faces to the characters.  Beyond that, it was a perfectly written \\"who done it\\".  You don't have to be a fan of the show, or ever watched at all to thoroughly enjoy this book.  I read it free with my Prime membership, but it's worth buying.  I love it when you can still be surprised right to the last page, and I was.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I is what they say it is. lots of games and easily addictive. I recommend it to anyone who likes quick games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I cannot say enough about being able to have such immediate access to a Bible anytime and everywhere.  It is so easy to use.  I love all the plans available.  Using this app is a daily /hourly part of my life.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i think its a good and fun game, simple and sweet. i don't know how u could improve, or do better. its simple.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Can't get the record feature to work for me other than that it works great. I was lucky to get the pro version free because I was a beta tester.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game has a lot of mini games in it. these games are a little challenging but is very good game if bored
B004O3YGMC|5.0|ok this is the best app out there. using my asus transformer to access my desktop and it works like a charm. havent tried over the net yet but if its half as good as the local then its worth 10 stars. heck i just played a couple min of WoW on my tablet would of played a little more if i had the docking keyboard to play with. but as i said this is insane and well worth the asking price. if i didnt get it as the free app i wiuld still buy it in a heart beat. kudos to the developers.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is ok good for passing time controls are a little hard but don't waste your time and space
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can't get over how simple this was to setup. Works flawlessly! Using a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse I was able to play Left 4 Dead 2 on my phone! It really gives full access! I recommend this to anyone who needs remote access (or who want to have fun).
B001LQQJ3E|5.0|I gave this to my parents as a Christmas gift. When they read which shows the set contained, they got so giddy & happy & started figuring out which they wanted to watch first. While cable is good, you have whatever show you want at your fingertips with this massive collection. Also, Amazon had the best price - I has first seen it in a catalogue for double the price.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|From the moment the beat in `Helena Beat' drops in, you know you're in for a fresh ride. This is definitely a record that took me awhile to warm up to. It's electro-rock. It's got an awesome vibe to it. It sounds great. It's different. In a lot of ways I feel it's where Radiohead left off with `Kid A'. It's got energy while still being electric. The sounds on this record sound very retro and very fresh at the same time.    At first it's hard to distinguish the songs themselves. `Helena Beat' is hard to comprehend where the hook actually is because all of it seems to be part of one whole sound. Upon more listens, you can distinguish what the keyboards are doing, the percussive sounds, the guitar, the `wooh ooh oh oohs'. Then comes `Pumped Up Kicks'. The song we all have known to love (or hate). Regardless, it's catchy, has a beat, is perfectly written and sounds interesting. It also makes people think. That sums up a perfect single to me.    `Call It What You Want' sums up their sound and record and puts everything in perspective for anyone who is confused by this band or style of music.    `Don't Stop' is by far one of my favorites. It reminds me of Blur as I used to love them. It's a britpop comeback and is the single that sold me on this record and band. Check out the live version. They KILL it. Oh yea...here's a band that can create a great record and also be able to pull it off live. That makes for a stable career for them. And I know we'll see greater and better things from it.    There's been interviews where Mark Foster has talked about hipsters and this record. A lot of people I know have slagged these guys off as hipsters themselves. In reality, they're geeks, the main one of which used to write jingles for commercials.    This record is fun, has elements of Of Montreal, elements of Radiohead, elements of Blur, elements of house music, and that's what I like. Every song sounds different, every song is a different genre. And that's what I think sums up a perfect record. The fact that this is their debut record, I think this might just be the most solid effort from a band since Oasis' `Definitely Maybe'.    All this being said, I still feel there's low points. One being Foster's voice has a tendency to get on the verge of annoying. So can the electronic bits that seem sporadically placed at times. I would've loved to hear a song on this record that's completely stripped down.    One of my favorite moments on this record is the chorus of `Houdini'. It shines in comparison to the rest of the tune, but is just such a great chorus that I find myself repeating it endlessly. When was the last time a band used that type of chord progression ?! Love it !!    I'm still getting into this record and it's still growing on me despite the positive review. I don't really know how to rate this thing.

1451627289|5.0|This is not a tightly plotted story. Nevertheless, I found it entrancing. The loose narrative actually adds realism because real life isn't tightly plotted either. King operates at an advanced level as a master storyteller. He's skillful enough to shatter conventional rules. The result: science fiction simply doesn't get any better than this.  In a way, 11/22/63 reads like a wide-eyed love song to the era that never over-idealizes. It details improvements in medical care, race relations and other areas. Jake, our main character, who goes by the name \\"George Amberson\\" in the late 1950's and early 1960's, experiences these positive and negative changes from a unique perspective.   Someone who's reading taste tends toward non-fiction might especially enjoy this novel. The narrator offers his time-traveling perspective comparing eras in a way no non-fiction book can possibly match. The novel's construction gives a patina of realism that's missing from a lot of fiction. After finishing the novel, I feel like I've been to the late 50's and early 60's (endearingly called \\"The Land of Ago\\") and have loved and lost right along with Jake or George.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I am in love with this record. It is a comeback for Grohl and friends. Not only hearing them back to their true form, recorded onto tape and with Pat Smear, but the songs are true gems themselves. The energy is just there and so are the riffs. Dave is in top notch performance.    They delve into deeper uncharted territory with `I Should've Known' in which Krist Novoselic plays bass, and Grohl gives his best, I repeat, BEST vocal performance to date.    `Bridge Burning' is the best opener since `Stacked Dead Actors', `Arlandria' harks back to Colour and the Shape days, and `White Limo' goes even further to their self titled.    Here's a band that can go back to their old sound, release music videos done on VHS tapes, can make a record in their garage, and still sell out stadiums. Nominated in various sites as album of the year, this one is a must spin.    I've never been more impressed with a record such as this.

B0055EDBIE|3.0|His ninth record to date, Kravitz wrote, recorded, and produced `Black and White America' himself mostly at his home studio in Miami as well as various locations throughout the world from which the songs were written about or while there. While the production is stellar, some of the songs seem barren in either their performance, structure, or instrumentation.    According to fans, Lenny hyped the release as being a `FUNK' record. While some songs get down and funky, most of it sounds like re-used 70s licks with cheesier keyboards. Not to say it's all a bad thing. It's Kravitz `the imitator' at his best and that's more talent than half of what's been released within the last 10 years to say the least.    Lyrically, this is one of the most uplifting records I have heard in almost 10 years.    The stand outs are definitely `Everything', `The Faith Of A Child' `Dream', and `Life Ain't Ever Been Better Than It is Now'.    Lenny, you made a solid effort, but we already know you're ripping off `James Brown'. You don't have to clearly state it in an already good song.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is hands down the BEST record of 2011. In every way. Very few people knew who Adele actually was aside from `Chasing Pavements' and that she owned SNL with her performance of it. I was in London when I heard `Rolling In The Deep' for the first time. I went nuts. It was the perfect written song, with a perfect production of it, with feeling and emotion, and a perfect performance all around. I had one of those music `geek' moments where I constantly hit replay and eagerly wonder what the rest of a record such as this one song would sound like...for hours.    Everyone back home thought it wouldn't be a single. Fast forward to a year later and I've now seen more than one comment from friends on Facebook saying they heard Adele on 4 radio stations at the same time !!    It's not just `Rolling In The Deep'. `Someone Like You' is by far one of my favorite piano ballads written since Fiona Apple's last repertoire or maybe even as far back as Billy Joel's \\"Lullaby\\".     `He Won't Go' is most definitely my favorite on the record with a sic drum groove. The thing about this record that just gets me everytime is not just the performance and production but how every drum fill is perfectly placed. It just hits home every time and drives the track further into your heart.    The only negative I would say about this record is that while stylistically diverse, it seems to lack anything heavier than `Rolling In The Deep'. That is just strictly a personal preference on my part.    21 is a genuine completely flawless humble record. It sounds like they're playing in your living room. It is sincere, heartfelt, and powerful. This will take all the awards at the Grammys.    Adele  21  Rating: 9.5/10    Check more out at: [...]

B0053YGYO4|2.0|I've been a Coldplay fan since the start as well. This album is absolute polished backwash. Every Teardrop is a Waterfall I can't even get through before turning the station. It's just boring as hell. Us Against The World is an attempt to do Johnny Cash all over again.  Hurts Like Heaven, U.F.O., and Up In Flames are the only tracks worth listening to on this record and if you can get past the Chris-Martin-Goes-Hip-Hop on Paradise then that track as well.  For people to call this brilliant...is beyond me. There's no stand out single that makes me want to hum along like the older stuff. And I really dug Viva La Vida. The only interesting thing about this record is the album cover and that's it ! Such ashame.  Coldplay  Random Album Title  Rating: 5/10  Check more reviews at: [...]
0143119788|5.0|This is one of John Le Carré's best novels.  I only hope that the upcoming film does justice to the suspense and classic deduction work that is depicted in the book.  A spy novel that needs no special effects or extreme action scenes to keep the reader on pins and needles until the end.
B005N0C0JQ|3.0|Even though he will always be praised and known for Oasis and being the major songwriter, Noel Gallagher has given us something to hope for, carry on with, that is arguably stronger than the last 3 Oasis records.    Starting off with a standard typical Noel sound with Everybody's On The Run, he dives into a bluesy rock track promptly titled Dream On. You can tell his High Flying Birds are going to take you on a journey. Is it wrong that I get an adrenaline rush everytime he says the words `Razorblade, lemonade, the bitch keeps on bitching...'?    The harmonies on this album are fantastic. Noel's vocals really shine. By song three the in your face pop songs start to drone a little but it's by song four that the album really opens up.    The Death Of You And Me is stellar in every way possible. Elements of Elliot Smith (see guitar melody), the Beatles (see Benefit of Mr. Kite), Oasis (What Noel does best), Stereophonics (see Chorus), Beck (see production style)...this song gets bonus points for per usual lyrics (I can see the storm cloud sucking up my soul). This is a fantastic song from start to finish.    AKA...What A Life is schizophrenic heavy on the drums with dark undertones on the guitar. It's a heavy rock song with fresh production. It's one of the best rock songs I've heard from Noel since Go Let It Out. The element of journey and fantasy are still here when he sings \\"Keep on chasing down that rainbow. You never know what you might find. Over the sunset on the horizon. Maybe you dream but it taste like poison. I'm gonna take that tiger outside for a ride...\\"    (Stranded On) The Wrong Beach is another great journeyesque track that keeps rocking long after it's finished (in your head that is). This darkness throughout the record really works despite some of the songs sounding too similiar together. Stop The Clocks is a perfect closer with a bombastic ending.    The b-sides are stellar quality as well. Let The Lord Shine A Light On Me is such a soulful and moving track that could've been featured on Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants. The Good Rebel screams Beatles all over in a punk / Stereophonics fashion. Alone On The Rope is a lackadaisical track with beautiful ethereal voices. Noel even goes country on I'd Pick You Everytime.    The only beef I've got is that I think the track listing could've been different replacing some b-sides with some boring moments on the record. It also takes awhile to get into this record and once again, the loudness war has affected its production. Still...a fantastic debut solo record from a man who is praised in the british and rock world. Keep on rocking Noel !!

0763639184|4.0|Story is a bit simple, I was hoping for a bit more of a plot, but 7 month old likes the bright fish pictures. Not sure this will an older baby entertained for long.
B005869U6G|3.0|From the moment the pulsing bass and drums come in on track one, you know something is different. It's not Morning View, it's not Light Grenades. It's much more subdued and stripped down. The strings are lush throughout. The production sounds are washed with reverb and 80s drums. If Not Now, When? could arguably pass as one of the greatest b-side records a band has put out.    I'm not sure how to take the record as it doesn't flow cohesively. The songs stand alone by themselves but there's nothing necessarily new here from Brandon and gang. They feel as if they're holding back. There is a lot more melody, which is what guitarist Mike Einziger hyped about before its release. Promises, Promises shows this in it's push and pull structure. That's probably the most \\"old-school\\" of tracks which reminds me of Crow or even Morning View.    Friends and Lovers is a solid track that sounds fresh and has an outstanding middle and end arrangement even though the lyrics fail in comparison.    There's a bunch of throwaway tracks on here. Isadore does nothing for me. The drums are on the verge of annoying.Thieves is not a terrible track but not a great track either causing me to skip it most of the time. Tomorrow's Food stands as a wonderfully beautiful track where every member shines except that it leaves you wanting more. It just doesn't feel finished to me.    Top tracks: The Original as it has a great groove from start to finish and harkens back to Morning View's Just A Phase. Defiance is a fresh acoustic track which has Brandon and Mike shine stripped down. I've always loved the Incubus punk-rock aesthetic, and Switchblade satisfies that with some of Einziger's signature hooks.    Adolescents sums up this record perfectly. A rock record mostly subdued with some fantastic moments though mostly leaves you wondering...what was it all about ??    Despite their effort...there's no denying they still ROCK!

0446573019|5.0|My son asked me what book I would like for Christmas.  We were shopping and I picked this one out, along with two others.  He figured I wanted this one the most, so he bought it.  I have always enjoyed Baldacci's works, so I didn't even read the inside flap, just figured if he got me that one, I'd enjoy it.  And I did!  I read it in two days.  I saw the reviews that compare this book to Lee Child's \\"The Affair\\".  Sure, there are similarities between John Puller and Jack Reacher and even in some areas of these books.  And if I had to choose, I doubt I could, between these books.  It's a fast action, thrilling book, just as it's supposed to be.  Read it and enjoy it.  And hope that maybe Baldacci makes Puller a series, like Lee Child did for Reacher!  Can't get enough!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This app is so bad. You have to unlock games by getting points by playing the six that are already unlocked, or BUYING POINTS WITH A CREDIT CARD. This seems like a big old scam to me. Horrible.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I read this on the recommendation of a friend of a friend and, despite not being huge into spacefaring literature, I found it to be a compelling and thought-provoking read.  The author delves into some pretty deep issues regarding individual human psychology, psychology of the masses, the \\"prisoner's dilemma\\", and \\"nature vs nurture\\", all while adhering to a rapidly advancing plotline with high stakes.  Even if you aren't a sci fi buff, this is well worth the time.

B003Z0D4SM|5.0|I read the book after I watched the European film and, though I liked the film somewhat, I found the book to be exemplary.<br /><br />Where the film had been a bit muddled and unclear at times, with some of the characters' traits and motivations left unexplained and vague, the book provided clarification and backstory in a manner that flowed remarkably well for what technically should be considered exposition.<br /><br />I have virtually no complaints about this book.  Occasionally, villains will delve into a brief \\"Bond villain\\" type explanation that defies realistic behavior...but these are short, tolerable, necessitated by the story and the ship quickly rights itself as these pages are still being digested by the reader.<br /><br />Well worth the time.  You will be hard pressed to find a book this long that reads this quickly.
B004NSULHM|3.0|Radiohead's 2011 album THE KING OF LIMBS takes a long step back from the pop overtures of their last couple of albums, in favour of songs that struggle to rise out of an ambient wash. While the band ostensibly played some traditional rock instruments in the studio, they then subjected all their recorded parts to electronic treatment and looped them.<br /><br />At its best, namely the tracks \\"Bloom\\", \\"Lotus Flower\\" and \\"Codex\\", the album sounds like KID A, but that doesn't mean that I think the band has scaled to real heights; rather, those similarities often make me want to pull down KID A from the shelf instead of going on with this album. Unfortunately, the rest of the songs on THE KING OF LIMBS are mainly forgettable. And  its 37 minutes of opiate soundscapes is unbroken by rough edges for necessary variety. Radiohead has talent both in rock and in IDM, but the former is sorely lacking here.<br /><br />The band seems to have had a good time recording this album, and it's pleasant listening, so THE KING OF LIMBS isn't a disaster, but it draws me less than other mature Radiohead releases, and I hope the next one will be different.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun game, just not my usual choice. would love more of an updated version. cant wait to unlock them all
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell Reflect is awesome!  It is very mesmerizing. It's a great way to relax your mind and get it moving at the same time! It takes concentration, patience and logical thinking to get through each level. At the same time, you're sliding around a water droplet going after pearls in a very serene environment. When you catch a pearl, it's like a splash of cool refreshing water just hit you in the face on a hot summer day. But, watch out! Those spiky barriers are causing conflict with your logic.   Then just when you think it's not possible, POW! The whole screen blows up because you just outsmarted your opponent! Awesome!

B0013LPS8E|4.0|Sounding more aggressive and with a rawer edge to it than 'Boy\\" or \\"October\\", \\"War\\" is a confrontational, anthemic release, and gained considerable recognition for U2 in North America, though their national breakthrough and elevation to one of the most universally recognizable bands around wouldn't come until the release of \\"The Joshua Tree\\" in 1987.   If \\"Boy\\"'s lyrical content dealt with the magical universe of childhood and the changes wrought upon it by growing maturity and \\"October\\" revolved around mastering the turmoil of the universe within through developing a spiritual relationship with God, then \\"War\\" is a politically-charged call for engagement with the forces of injustice imposed upon those whom society has marginalized, disenfranchised, or attempted to remove with extreme prejudice.   Steve Lillywhite, \\"War\\"'s producer, helped the band to craft a martial, energetic, combative sound reflective of \\"War\\"s lyrical content, investing most of the tracks with a \\"drier\\" ambience, and though Edge's guitar work is still driven by effects, it possesses more of punchier, aggressive feel to it, and the production values brought to bear percussively lend a rhythmically insistent feel to the three singles that went into heavy rotation from this release, \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"New Year's Day\\", and \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\", as well as the lesser-known \\"Seconds\\", \\"Like A Song\\", and the rousing \\"Surrender\\", which should have joined the list of previously referenced hits. Bono's dramatic, impassioned delivery imparts a real sense of immediacy to his vocals, his lyrics still retaining strong religious overtones in places, most notably his adaption of the 40th Old Testament Psalm, the subdued, querying, yet uplifting \\"40\\". Serving as my own personal gateway into U2's passionate musical universe, 'War\\" (with the exception of \\"Refugee\\" and \\"Red Light\\") has aged remarkably well, and is still a compelling listen nearly three decades later.

B000EXDS5M|1.0|The DVD hung in the middle of playing and could not be restarted to play again. A defective product.  The DVD untill that time was good; good acting and good action.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I recieved this product for Christmas, and have not been very happy with it so far.  It has two major deal breakers for me:  1) A constant hiss.  Even with the volume slider turned all the way off and no audio coming through the headphones, there is still a fairly loud hiss.  Its very distracting.  2) It has a \\"Mic Monitor\\" feature, that instantly sends any microphone input into the headphones.  I find this very annoying, and there is no way to turn if off.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|Just got this light about an hour ago. It is cloudy today and this flashlight is super bright. It is so bright I really do not have a use for it. I am going to give this light to a friend as a gift, because he lives on a big farm. If you need a super bright flashlight that will throw a beam several hundred yards then this is what you need. Although I really like this light it will be better for someone who can really use it instead of just a toy for me and that is why I will be giving this to my friend because instead of getting out the big spotlight he can just grab this.  Just wanted to add that Amazon's customer service is great! They are truly second to none. I am not exactly sure what happened to the first flashlight I ordered, but when I tracked it UPS had it as delivered but we could not find it anywhere. I called Amazon and they told me to wait for a couple of days because it might show up. It never showed up and Amazon promptly sent me another one free of charge. I am not sure but I think the flashlight was mistakenly delivered one road down from where I live to a house exactly like ours but there is no road sign indicating a road name. I went to the house and ask if they had gotten a shipment meant for my house and they said no. Not sure if they would tell the truth though because the people who live there all stay in trouble with the police and the police are at their house almost every week.We read in the newspaper a few weeks ago that the police had arrested 3 people who live there for having stolen property so they may have a free expensive flashlight as well?
0439023521|4.0|This review will grade this book based as a `teen' book and not as adult literature.  My twenty-five year daughter really enjoyed it and told me that it was all the rage in her circles, so I decided to read it.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has written a decent teen thriller based on a futuristic look at the United States as it is split up into districts for various provisions (coal, farming, etc) and then the Capitol, which houses the wealthy of the land and has control over all of the other provinces.  The Hunger Games are featured once per year in an attempt to make sure that the people of this country understand who is in control.<br /><br />The writing is good, not great.  The story is interesting, but has its share of trite, easily calculated turns.  The story does not go deeply into any areas, but the author keeps the story moving.  There are a few lulls and occasionally I found myself bored and skimming to something that would re-establish my interest.  The writing is certainly not literature, but then again it is not condescending to teens either.  There are plenty of times that artistic license is taken and sometimes it seems over the top.  Parts are gory, but the sexual content is non-existent and therefore appropriate for a young audience.<br /><br />I think that it will make a better movie than book and shortly the movie will be on the big screen.  I rate it four stars as a teen thriller.

B001GP7PMO|5.0|There's nothing one can possibly write about this and deem it a \\"review\\", for this live cut of The Floyd in their early days. Gilmore had become a staple and they were playing live in front of nothing but remotely placed cameras around the great ruins of Pompeii for over 2 hours, non-stop, the only breaks being editorial as it shows them in candid settings like a simple diner in England having toast and tea, when Nick Mason orders pie without the crust. By the 5th or 6th viewing, you'll realize exactly what Waters and Gilmore are describing in that diner. That their \\"instruments are merely extensions of their creative thought process. Whatever [it is they're] using to make \\"music\\" with, it must be an extension of the mind and body, the musician masters the instrument, the instrument or any tool used to generate music from cannot limit, hamper or control the musician because the musician masters whatever that instrument is\\". When Waters is screwing with the dials of an ancient, 2nd grade science project tool used to measure the pitch and tone of any frequency, a scientific instrument that wails an electronic high and low pitch depending on how he turns the dials; Using that genius talent, he turns the this archaic scientific instrument into an elegant musical device reflective of the time and era in which they were from, as a sharp contrast to their surroundings, which dates back to Julius Caesar. It's not just a video of Pink Floyd playing live, it's both an auditory and visually mind blowing presentation from one of the greatest bands, if not the greatest, to have ever played together as a group. There will never be another Pink Floyd like the one you see in this video, if you're lucky enough to have a copy of this rare DVD.<br /><br />I write this with the most broken heart, as I just sold my new copy (although I still have an older copy), but I was hoping to pass the new one down to my prodigy, but alas, the PhD bill beckons, and Amazon once again delivers a rare jewel to a lucky person at the expense of another. Letting go of this was like letting go of a family jewel.<br /><br />When you see Roger Waters standing atop the hill in the background providing rhythm using a giant gong, with Gilmore seated barefoot on the ground surrounded by the ruins of Pompeii, playing the guitar from another dimension (just look in his eyes, you'll see he's not on/from this world) you realize you're literally nothing but a speck of dust blowing by in their world. As lucky as those from Mozart's, Beethoven's and Francisco Tarrega's circa were to have been alive when those giants roamed this earth.<br /><br />There's nothing like this of The Floyd and there never will be again.<br /><br />Whoever took this prized possession from me, enjoy it. I'll forever remember having it. When it's worth $10,000 and up. But regardless of the value, I pray you will cherish it the way I did.<br /><br />Pej Hamidia lucky person at the expense of another.

0553801473|4.0|I waited until I had read this book at least twice before penning a review and now that I have I feel I can get past any initial reactions that may have been biased and review A Dance With Dragons on its own merit.<br /><br />With that said, I do think people are being unduly harsh on the book.  It may seem like splitting hairs but this book deserves at least another half star.  It's not a three star book by any means but maybe not quite a four star one either.  It's very decent and trumps A Feast for Crows but it also was disappointing in some respects as well as every other reviewer on this site has likely pointed out.<br /><br />Some of the character POVs I was looking forward to the most proved the biggest letdown while others surprised me by being much better than I expected and in my opinion, better than they'd been in previous books.  Personally, I always enjoyed the story lines set in Westeros far better than in the land of the Free Cities and that proves true for ADWD as well.  Unfortunately, a great deal of the story takes place in that region - more so than any of the others - which didn't boost my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />Tyrion's story line, for example, follows him as he's smuggled across the narrow sea to the Free Cities where he decides to travel to Daenareys to offer her support.  I thought this was a bit of an odd move on his part and his explanation of what he had to offer her didn't quite seem that impressive to me.  But nevertheless, his fate was the one I had been most looking forward to finding out about and unfortunately his story line was without a doubt the most disappointing.  See, Tyrion is schemer and a plotter.  That's why he fit so well in at Kings Landing.  Without that backdrop behind him - or even Westeros for that matter - he feels wasted and underutilized to me.  Instead, he's reduced to humdrum one-liners and endless reminiscing about Tasha and his father.  The introduction of Ser Jorah into his story started out great but then dissolved into a buddy-companion traveling tale.  In short, Jorah adds nothing to the story and neither for that matter, does the introduction of another female dwarf.  That move by GRRM baffled me and felt hackneyed and corny.  Neither characters add anything to Tyrion's arc and aren't used as anything more than people to add lines of dialogue to his chapters.<br /><br />The other two Free Cities POVs also felt dull and difficult to get through.  I never liked Daenerys Targaren's story.  At least, not beyond the first book.  It just never interested me that much and I could never connect with her character.  This book was no exception.  Reading about her horrible attempts at ruling a city were a chore and I just don't understand her modus operandi.  GRRM also seems to take a page out of Stephanie Meyers books and takes the opportunity to jam as much fawning over some sellsword Daenerys has a crush on as possible.  Not a chapter of hers goes by without a mention of him and how much Daenerys wants him in her bed.  Not to mention, the notable lack of dragons for most of the book was pretty disappointing as well.<br /><br />The other Free Cities story line I didn't like was the Dornish prince and his attempt to travel to Daenerys to woo her.  I didn't like his character.  I didn't like his companions.  He didn't seem to be much more than a way to fill pages of the book.  In short, he could have been left out entirely and the novel wouldn't have been that much different.  Even his biggest mistake at the end of the book could have been written in number of different ways.  His travels through the Free Cities are boring and uninteresting and no point did I connect or root for his character.<br /><br />Now, the POVs did that I DID like.  Davos' story really surprised me.  I had never really like Davos that much either.  He felt boring to me and his was yet another character I didn't feel much about.  But as we follow him through his travels to White Harbor and hisattempts to gather support for Stannis I was increasingly engrossed with his story and found myself rooting for him to succeed.  I also like that we finally got a glimpse of White Harbor after all this time and also a taste of what the Freys are up to these days.<br /><br />Reek's chapters, aka Theon, was my favorite.  His was also the most brutal, in my opinion, brutality being something I'd come to expect from GRRM.  I very  much liked his change of character and how he'd been reduced from the smarmy, wise-ass kid from before into sniveling shadow of what he'd been.  We also get a taste of what's going on in Winterfell and that section of the North after everything's that's happened and the Bastard of Bolton is always awesome to follow.  At the very end of the novel, I feel like we get a slight treat at seeing something of a restoration in Theon, if only just ever so slight, into the person he'd once been before.<br /><br />As for the other story lines, I won't go into detail with every one but Jon Snow's was probably the other favorite of mine although I found myself getting increasingly frustrated with his behavior.  For all his intelligence, he does some really stupid stuff sometimes.  GRRM also graces us with at least one chapter for all the other characters we've been wondering about including Cersei, Jaime and Arya.  I liked that he didn't go into too much detail about their fates but gave us enough hints that I felt satisfied and also looking forward to hearing more.<br /><br />Much of the book does feel somewhat slow throughout all this but I feel like it picks up at the very end with a POV from Barristan Selmy and also surprisingly, one from Kevan Lannister and we even get a brief glimpse of Varys in there.<br /><br />All in all, this is decent entry from GRRM into the series and while I have no doubt it won't entirely satisfy most of his fans (myself included) I do feel sated and am glad that I got a chance to read it.  I would give it three and a half stars out of five if I could but since not, I'll round up to four to be generous.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I had been monitoring temperatures on my older Q8300/GA-G31M-ES2L (2.5GHz) combo, my hacky.  They always seemed a bit high, running idle around 45 C and occasionally reaching into the high 50s under load (with no over clocking).  After installing, I  tried OC for the first time, and was able to hit the limitations of my setup.  I am currently running at 2.95 GHz and using a stress loader, temperatures reached mid-45s.  Under normal-idle use (surfing the web, some light photo editing), temps are 35-37C in all four cores.  Regarding noise, I'd say it's equivalent, if not, a tad more noticeable.  But that could be because I'm trying to listen for fan noise.  I used the thermal paste that came with the cooler, and it seems like it's doing a great job.  This cooler is massive compared to the stock one, that it has no other alternative BUT to stay cool.  Word of warning: I installed this in my Micro-ATX case and the copper ends (that are not flush with the aluminum fins), were protruding past the edge of the case.  I could put the cover on.  I had to drill/saw some openings in the case to allow for proper seating of the case side.  Once I send this setup to the grave, I'll be sure to take this cooler with me to my next project.  Again, take measurements, otherwise, be prepare to hack your tacky.
0811874192|5.0|Gave two of these books as gifts - they are gorgeous, clever and were VERY well liked by the recipients.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This app is just plain terrible. The games stink and the ads are over the line.  Save yourself the time and skip it.
1451627289|1.0|Okay, I've been notified that for whatever reason, my review must be at least twenty words long, so now I am adding some superfluous gibberish. (\\"Superfluous.\\" Now there's a word. I digress..)  Too bad, because seriously, all I - a lifelong Stephen King fan! - really have to say about this book is said best and most succinctly in those six letters: Stupid.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|you get what you see in the title. A lot of games. Some are better than others but is is fun and it is free.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Just a great movie! San Francisco has always been my favorite city in the U.S. All the different venues in this city make \\"Bullitt\\" a classic in every sense of the word. The Golden Gate Bridge, the Bay Bridge, Alcatraz, the Mark Hopkins Hotel, Pacific Heights, the hills, cable cars, the Embarcadero, albeit a much older pre-1989 version, are all here. Steve McQueen turns in a terrific performance, but the cast of characters also meshes well with his character. Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn),Captain Bennett (Simon Oakland), Sgt. Delgetti (Don Gordon), Captain Baker (Norman Fell), Weisberg the Cabbie (Robert Duvall), as well as girlfriend Cathy (Jacqueline Bisset) all turn in very fine performances. This cast of characters has to be one of the best ever. They all fit together seamlessly. Whoever came up with the chemistry in this movie is a genius. The chase scene is the one that defines all others. I defy anyone to come up with a better one. If you look closely at the start of the chase, when the sequence takes you down the hill with brief glimpses of Alcatraz in the distance, look for the silhouetted faces of the stunt driver and his passenger. These two guys are definitely enjoying their work. No one is on a par with McQueen's driving. His is in another galaxy. If I was a cop, I would want Captain Bennett as my boss. He is a tough straight-shooter extraordinaire! The dialogue in this movie is memorable, especially between McQueen and Vaughn. Lalo Schifrin's music keeps this flick moving.I just hope no one gets the bright idea to make this movie again, as there are no suitable replacements for any of these actors. A once and done enduring classic, to be left that way. In other words, a can't miss movie!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Great app with very realistic and soothing sounds. I love that you can layer the sounds to create a custom mix. The sleep timer is nice too.  Totally worth the cost of the app.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|lots of games and lots of fun if you can not find a game you like you will find it here
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very good app goes on your computer and everything not complicated at all.just go on the web site and follow the directions and your good to exllent app I would recemend to everyone
B005F96UNM|5.0|I just watched in Blu-ray this movie. Make  a movie  like this is not for everyone! Great visual, a mix of a lot of influences, great interpretations, great scenes, great music. Few scenes are weak, maybe when they go to the camp. Must watch!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|best solitaire app for spider solitaire I have played and I have tried a lot.  I am playing on a kindle fire and it fits the screen perfect for me.  simple settings.  I reccomend.

B004EPZ06G|4.0|I loved the first Hangover movie and this one is very similair to that and very funny. It has the same story line but new jokes that will keep you laughing.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got it for free from Amazon but if I knew it was this good, I would have bought it a long time ago! Now, I can access my pc easily from my g2x.
B0000027DJ|5.0|This was my very first introduction to not only Alice, but how awesome rock music is, 11 years ago when I was in elementary school. I absolutely fell in love with Wind-up Toy and pestered my karate instructor incessantly to make me a tape of the album, which I listened to so much that my dad bought me the cd as a surprise gift. Fast forward to now, I'm still an Alice fangirl and I still adore this album. I even got a copy on vinyl for Christmas one year and treasure it. My favorites on this album are Wind-up Toy (of course), Might as Well Be on Mars and Love's a Loaded Gun (which reminds me of Desperado from Killer in the best possible way!). Like so many of his great albums, he doesn't limit himself to only one sound in Hey Stoopid and only gets better on subsequent listens.   If you like Alice or are just curious, give this a listen (or two or three!)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ok games but the cost is too high to unlock levels. you have to keep replaying levels to earn coins.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I like it cause I can access my home computer but I don't like that I cant access my computer if it is off or not with me I thought I was going to be able to access it if I was out somewhere but u cant have to be turned on And with you. which I think is pointless for all that when I turn it on I would just rather sit in front of it and use it than use my kindle for it. glad I got it free and did not pay 4.99 for it
1932100660|5.0|If you are going to read a book on diet, read this one.  The author, one of the most qualified people in the world to discuss the relationship between diet and health, was a lead scientist of the massive China Study, a two decades long look at diet and disease patterns in rural China.  More than 6,500 people in sixty-five counties participated.  To this day, the study is unmatched in its breadth.  To sum up, what they found amounted to a scathing indictment of animal based diets, whether in China or America or anywhere else.<br /><br />No doubt many people will try arguing with the conclusions, as they amout to nothing less than a wholesale rejection of the standard American diet (SAD).  In place of our large quantities of meat and milk, processed sugars and denatured carbohydrates, Dr. Campbell argues for a whole grains, fruit and vegetables based diet, and demonstrates convincingly that such a diet is not only preventative of disease, but can actually reverse or ameliorate life threatening illnesses.  He supports this argument not only with the results of the China Study itself, but also with the findings of hundreds of other peer reviewed articles published in well-known scientific journals.<br /><br />The book is to an extent autobiographical in nature.  Dr. Campbell tells us about how he grew up on his family's farm, eating-and enjoying-the typical hearty farm fare of bacon, sausages, eggs, milk, etc.  Then, early in his scientific career, while studying the conjoined effects of aflotoxin and various proteins, he noticed that rats ingesting lower quantities of protein did not succumb to the potent carcinogen.  This was the start of what became a life-long bucking against \\"established\\" knowledge that had assumed there was no relationship between diet and cancer; everyone had assumed it was \\"in the genes.\\"<br /><br />The core of the book looks at several diseases of affluence and their relationship to diet, diseases such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, common cancers (breast, prostate, bowel), autoimmune diseases, as well as others such as bone, kidney, eye and brain disorders.  All demonstrate significant linkage with diet, and all demonstrate significant treatability by diet.  A very short third section offers a guide to nutrition, basically a quick primer on how to live vegan and still get everything you need.  The final section of the book is the one most likely to cause people to gnash their teeth and groan, for here Dr. Campbell reveals the behind-the-scenes machinations of our government, corporations and scientific bodies as they scratch each others backs, work to maintain the status quo (an ignorant public), and do whatever it takes to maximize profits.  I found this section nothing short of infuriating, and realized that even the company I work for, a leading cancer research facility, is no different in its focus to develop drugs and devices that, while perhaps extending a few patients' lives a few years, will exercise their most significant impact by enriching Big Pharma.<br /><br />This book is a wake up call.  It's the sort you want to tell people about, buy for your well-meaning but ignorant friends and relatives, and even put into practice.  I've considered and tried vegetarianism before; this book will likely prove the kick that sends me over the fence.<br /><br />Highly recommended!bowel), autoimmune diseases, as well as others such as bone, kidney, eye and brain disorders.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game for such a low price. Hours of fun and a very relaxing game. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
1846554071|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful. I have read reviews saying that this book is not a good place to start for those, like me, who have not read any of Murakami's earlier work. Then i was given this as a Christmas present - and what a present!   Since starting this 4 days ago I have found myself thinking about it whilst doing something else, rushing home from work to read more, staying up late to find to find out what would happen next...and now it's finished and I am going straight into starting book 3. I feel sympathy for the Japanese readers who had to wait a year for that.  But this is not a page turning thriller which hurtles along through the pace of events. It is much more like a beautiful water color painting, starting in its creation with light colors, then the darker colors going on, then the little highlights, as the picture emerges in all its mesmerising and distinctive beauty. Murakami waves a magic which draws you in and holds onto you.  There is a fascinating plot line, following the lives of the main characters Aomame and Tengo, in alternate chapters. At first their lives seem utterly separate, but gradually the links between them become clearer and ever more compelling, whilst the nature of their work becomes a little stranger.  Judging by some other reviews i have read, this book is not for everyone, but if you like Ian McEwan or Kazuo Ishiguro you will probably love this - but it is unique, and all the better for that.  Highly recommended
B004MC8CA2|3.0|good app. does crash a lot. I finished the blended yearly Bible and it would not go past 99.5% complete. : (
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Playing this on my kindle fire. seems to work well so far. cute games that are easy to play. the ads are a little annoying but I got the game for free so shouldn't complain :)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|solid Bible app on iOS and seems good so far on ki nd le fire. need another couple words to hit minimum
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy was purchased for my oldest son for a Christmas present!  He DEVOURS books!  He must like the set, as he's already half through them!!!!  So, that is a good sign!  I'm glad he's half done - then I can borrow them !!!!!!  He, He!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Everything was as expected. The one thing that could have been better was some clear indication of when we were to expect delivery.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Picked this app up a few days before it was free.  Very easy to set up, even the access via Internet.  Had severe performance issues when using to connect to a WiFi laptop.  Switched the laptop to a 100base Ethernet connection and the performance issues vanished.  Still slight lag on commands, but not enough to interfere with tasks.  Can't quite get the hang of the &quot;scroll&quot; gesture.  Sometimes it works, sometimes not.  I'd definitely recommend this app to friends and co-workers.  Fix the lag and gestures and it's a 5 star app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the ads are basically ads for other apps<br /><br /> I found a great grocery shopping app and unlocked 5 new games.  I clicked on another advertisement and the link was not valid but it still gave me the free points/games.<br /><br /> looks like a great way to play games and find new apps for free
B004X80QNG|1.0|One of the most touted feature for this app is the ability to sync with Toodledo, a cloud-based task provider that is much more robust than Google Task.   Pocket Informant (PI) \\"supposedly\\" have the ability to automatically sync Toodledo task in the background, but this feature does not work. Task doesn't auto-sync at the specified frequency (30 min, 1 hours, etc.). Email to support was not answered.   So if you use Toodledo, stay away from this app.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best Bible app and the fact that it is free makes it even better! love the variety of reading plans available.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is definitely by far one of my favorote apps on my Kindle Fire. It's so useful and works perfectly. Can't beat the price either. Usually these kinds of apps are a lot more than 5 dollars. I was skeptical towards it at first since Amazon was offering it as the free app of the day, but I was pleasantly surprised.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I bought these to replace my regular DVDs and while the films are complete and excellent in Blu-Ray,  the bonus features on discs 1-5 will not play on my player. Bonus features for the last 2 films will play, however. Somewhat disappointing but my main concern was to see the movie not the bonus features.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|This app is great. it has 3 tables, Western, Carnival, &amp; Sea diving. The only problem is, these tables are so stink'in easy. I'm a pro at digital pinball. This app is a breeze for me. And there's another problem, ball launching. When you try to launch the ball into play, it sometimes doesn't let you pull back as much as it shows you can do. I've checked the settings and there seems to be no way to change that.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Games are really basic and the few that I played before deleting the app weren't that interesting.  Not bad just not great for my taste.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It is the best fantasy novel I have ever read, it reads like a historical novel set in a medieval world but slowly there comes more supernatural stuff into the story, I have read it two times and the reread was a wonderful as my first read.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Much has been written in praise of this P&P production so I won't elaborate other than to agree.  Repeat viewings of this film yield an increased appreciation of its excellence.   What I will say is this film is a complete and sufficient reason to buy a Blu-ray player.  It is a stunning restoration, adding another layer to this incredible production.  I can think of perhaps 10 movies worth having in Blu-ray, and this has to be number 1 on that list.  I also have an older DVD (non Blu-ray) versions of this P&P, and the Blu-ray looks MUCH better.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have been wanting such an app. Thank you amazon. Definitely worth the price. Easy to set up. Easier to use. No lag. I use a vnc program at work that is VERY LAGGY. This is quick like a bunny.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I haven't read any books in a long time. I thought I would read this one while I was out of school for the holidays. I finished it in 2 days because I couldn't put it down. I don't really care for poetry either but I really enjoyed what was in the book. It was well written and kept my attention, suprised me and made me laugh and cry.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|After reading about Evernote and it's creators in one of my mags, I decided to give it a try. Needless to say, I upgraded to premium soon after and turned my hubby on to it. Love it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|okay The game has some good games in it but getting points is to much of a hassel and using money for it is probally a waste so I give it a three
B005T87QCI|1.0|terribly terrible game do not buy no matter what waste of money its so bad I couldent even belife how bad it was
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. I love it very very very much. it is pretty awesome because you earn points and buy games with those points.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|Downloaded this app, and well it's fun to play, but it crashes at random intervals which cancels out the fun parts. When it's working its fine but since I can't depend on it to keep running I've deleted it from my fire.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|fun game, some are extremely hard and boring but other wise ok. the mass amount of ads is very nerve racking. less adds more stars
B0002S943O|5.0|This is the best show of Depeche Mode to me. Just amazing, incredible. I just love Devotional era. I had an excellent purchase.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I truly enjoy this app. It's easy to use, the variety of study plans is amazing. I love the fact of being able to highlight a section from my daily reading, to share with friends on FB or Twitter. Thanks for such a User friendly app!
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|This was a anti American environmental wacko propaganda film not about a 3d adventure. The film bashed electrical providers but I bet they are the first ones to call  when the power goes out.
0062082353|1.0|I read an average of 30 books a year, and this is by far the crappiest book i've ever encountered. I can't even get myself to finish it. I frankly can't understand how many people are giving good reviews about this book: my only guess is that they are giving them as a tribute to what they believe is a hero. But here we're talking about rating a book, not the man behind. So: 1) The book is poorly written in a way that it's impossible to describe: i've never read anything commercial so poorly written. It's frankly embarassing, the author moves from story to story without clue, without details, anecdotes, there's basically no point in anything. There's one chapter in which he goes on telling us about how he spent one night in search of an intruder in his house before realizing that there was no-one in the house. I mean, really, as interesting as giving us details on how he washes his teeth. It's embarassing, i can't say more. 2) As many, i'm interested in the details of how elite forces operates: techniques, weapons, training, etc. There's absolutely nothing in this book. Literally nothing. No details on his training, the way he shoots, the way he operates, zero, nada. He basically says that he's done lot of training, then was sent to iraq, and then every day he takes his gun and shoots down people. This is the level of information he gives. Embarassing. 3) Now to the trickiest part: ethical judgment. Let me clear it: i'm not from US, i'm European, but i'm certainly the farthest you can go to being &#34;anti-american&#34;. Now, this book makes you understand why some people do hate the way US operates. It's such a condensate of the worst stereo-type of the American soldier bragging about giving bad guys what they deserve, how it's stupid that there are rules of engagement, how they should kill everyone, and who cares if maybe the guy was a civilian, it's one less, how he is happy to kill people, how he wants to kill more, how they have a competition on who kills more.And this is written AFTER you know that the guy should have not been there, in Iraq, in the first place. AFTER he should know that the war he was sent on had nothing to do with revenge about 9/11. AFTER he knows that in Falluja there were hundreds of civilians burned alive for nothing. I totally understand that to perform that job you need to be indoctrinated, and you need to be fanatic to some extent. You just wouldn't do it if you weren't. This book has nothing to do with heroism or being american: this book is just about a guy who is making some money leveraging on the well deserved popularity Seals have gained after Obama.  If i were American, i would be embarassed to read how one of my heroes is happy about slaughtering people back in THEIR home that have nothing to do with my country.  And let me re-clarify it: i love and deeply respect US, i'm totally in favor of wars when they have a meaning, but this guy is just the worst stereotype ever of the All-American All-idiot soldier. And...he certainly can't write.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|This is very pretty.  It feels and looks high quality.  It is a beautiful color and the color is true to the picture.  Very easy to use.  The bright color also makes it easy to locate my kindle when I've lost it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game! I just wish it wasn't  so addicting! I feel like a junkie because  I spent all my coins &amp;&amp; I NEED more!!!!
B0017ZB8M6|1.0|Thats was the ONLY song that could even count as good and MAYBE Hot N' Cold. And even now Teenage Dreams is still terrible
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|The sixth season was awesome. I was glued to the tv not wanting to leave until I had watched the whole season.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kids enjoy the games and I play the games to pass time...it is an okay download, wish it was ad free
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I am surprised by how well this app works.  It fusions just as it says and very smooth at it. connects easily, and control is good.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app works great and does everything that I would hope that it did. it was very easy to set up and get it working. highly recommend it!
B003Y3AZSW|3.0|Hi.. I considered purchasing this board at a local gourmet kitchen shop, but it's really far too small. An entire chicken would dwarf it's meat board and my first thought was that there'd be garbage all over the counters and meat blood dripping off the sides, because it's FAR too small.  If you chopped 2 onions, it would cover the entire board. It's barely larger than an ipad.   Just input from someone who's physically handled it but not bought. Also..it's a GREAT idea, in theory. Just too small.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is exactly the app i was looking for i can access my computer where ever i am from. my kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|5.0|these games are relatively fast and fun to play. great for all ages. great for children with short attention spans.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is fun but don't get the update . some of.the games are hard others are really easy. It takes a while to get more games.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|App is  not installing properly. Unable to remove from trying to install. Droid x and kindle fire. I wish I could rate a negative number.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Reasonably designed minigames, some much more tedious than others.  You have to do stuff like leaving reviews to unlock higher levels unless you want to spend money.  I'm cheap so here's my review.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I really enjoy this game, refreshing to find an mmo that I can afford.  It plays like your standard WoW like game(A good thing in my opinion).  To those having trouble with update, just re-download it and it will work fine.
B004EPZ0BQ|1.0|I purchased two Sony movies this past week, and this movie was one of them.  However, neither contained the Ultraviolet digital copy code advertised on their covers.  There was no paper insert or sticker.  I will have to return this and hopefully the code won't be missing from the replacement.  If you peruse the Amazon reviews, this appears to be a common problem.  Shame on Sony for this, as well as for the decision to go with Ultraviolet instead of the easy-to-use iTunes.
B0045OHUNM|4.0|It does sound like a 1 woman show.  Nonetheless, I like it.  It has a variety of ethnic rhythmic tones to it and if you are in the mood for something a little different this music is worthy of adding into your versatile music collection.  Can't stop playing 'My Sister Says the Saddest Things'.  Kind of music I could play at parties and people would ask 'Who is this?'.
B005IGDW24|3.0|I purchased two Sony movies this past week, and this movie was one of them.  I opened each one up to look for the digital copy code... and didn't find them.  The Ultraviolet sticker on the Blu-Ray case stated that the code was inside the case, but it wasn't.  There was only a code for Sony Movie Rewards inside, but that code is different from the Ultraviolet code.  After e-mailing Sony, I received a response that the code was on the back of the sticker on the clear plastic wrapping of the disc.  Fortunately, I still had the wrapping of both discs, and lo and behold, on the back of the sticker on the wrapping was the code.  So interestingly, the sticker on the clear plastic wrap states that the code is on the back, while the sticker on the disc case states the code is inside.  Nice contradiction, but more importantly, it's poor human factors/ergonomic packaging design that deviates from consumers' expectations.  When 99% of digital download codes (e.g. your iTune digital download codes and Ultraviolet digital download codes on Warner Bros. discs) are located on a sheet of paper inside the disc case, and you decide to put it on the outside along with a different sticker stating that it's on the inside, you are setting yourself up for headaches, Sony.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|All the mini games are a lot of fun to play. The best free game i have been able to play yet.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just downloaded on my new kindle fire.  easy to play, great graphics, and lots of fun!  Would recommend to any solitaire lover.
B00466HM28|5.0|My girlfriend bought this for my birthday.. I wanted a sleek USB Midi Controller, for my iPad, got the camera usb adapter plugged it all in to my iPad, and it recognized first try!  Love it when i travel, keeps me busy for hours. Very Lightweight but well built..
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this app is incredible. I just started using it, but it's worked flawlessly. the Internet on my computer that I use on the kindle fire because of this app is actually faster than the kindle browser.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app.... I'm sad that it finally made it's way onto the market after we started getting hulu and Netflix... Etc,  but I'm loving this app.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Case is awesome!  Fits like a glove, and allows you to still show off the beauty of the iphone design.  Many compliments on the first day!  The screen protector is awesome, BTW.  Feels similar to the actual glass screen itself- not sticky and orange-peely like the ones from Zagg.  Great buy!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|decent game but bad controls for a few of the mini games such as snakes n the bat game good time killer
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is just awesome for the kindle fire. Best part it's FREE for today!  I was able to control my home PC over local area network without lag. Splashtop could come in handy if you wanted to control a PC for server use only. Once you got Splashtop software installed on server PC. You really won't need a monitor or anything hooked upto it anymore. For any reason you need access to change something. You can use your Android type device and access that PC.  How well it will work while accessing home PC from else where. Might depend how fast your home braodband is and where you are accessing it from say Hotel or something.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very nice game.  takes a little to learn the individual games. should b instructions for each game. but most are easy enough

0857685570|5.0|This book was very beautiful. The book was a Christmas present for my son, and he was thrilled. Amazing artwork. Exactly what he was looking for.
0743298020|5.0|Loved this book!  The story draws you in like a soft warm blanket, and keeps you engaged through a wonderful story of love, love lost, love never found, and love so profound one would do anything to hold on to it.   This is one of those books I will hold onto to reread again.
B0040JHLM2|5.0|Wow!  What a difference a good shoe can make!  As a beginning runner, I just went to my local sports store and picked up a pair of Nike running shoes that fit well.  Within 2 months, I sustained bursitis of the knee which put me out of commission for 2 weeks.  The ortho never mentioned that it could be my shoes--just that the injury was from overuse.  Fast forward a couple more months and mild knee pain returned.  I google'd and discovered that this pain could be a result from improper shoes (albeit running shoes).  I located a store specializing in running shoes only and had a \\"video\\" fitting whereby they record your gait on a computer and recommend a proper running shoe.  They offered a Saucony, K-Swiss and Brooks.  The Brooks felt the best--like walking on a cloud, but provided excellent support for my pronation.  Long story short, knee pain is completely gone and these shoes feel great.  Highly recommend to try if you're experiencing knee pain.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer gets a bad rap by a lot of guitarists, mostly for his penchant for writing radio-friendly hits and lyrics. I gotta hand it to him though, he's a very good blues guitar player once you cut through the Top 40. My only complaint is that he doesn't turn loose a bit more. When he finally does, it's in short bursts that leave you wanting to hear more. Lyrically, as well as his voice, he's as fine a songwriter/singer as anyone. This may be my favorite album of his overall, in that it seems a little more 'world experienced'. There's not a weak song on here. This is an excellent cd to throw in and just relax; of course you end up humming along. Mayer fan and don't have this? Get it.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|probably will remove this one soon. low quality and not that fun. don't like how not all the games are unlocked.

B005HXGE9G|4.0|This has been an intriguing year--Kate Bush decided to re-make and remodel some of her old material in the form of \\"The Director's Cut\\" and Peter Gabriel decided that hell would freeze over before other artists would complete the companion piece to last year's \\"Scratch My Back\\" so why not re-make and re-model his old material in the meantime. Gabriel wins by a landslide here. Why? Well, he goes for the gold, attacking his back catalog with vigor, deconstructing and reconstructing while Bush just languishes in slight, almost unnoticeable changes.<br /><br />The disappointing thing is that Gabriel offered other artists a golden opportunity to shine by covering a Gabriel classic, but like Genesis, these other artists just didn't 'get' Gabriel. It's also a sign of the climate of arrogance and selfishness in the music business that such a well established artist like Gabriel doesn't get the peer respect he deserves. I guess everyone was just 'too busy' to make it to their respective studios and record one measly Gabriel classic. Shame on Paul Simon for not taking on \\"Mercy Street\\"--you know he'd do a great job of it. That song was meant for him. Shame on Lou Reed for not giving \\"Darkness\\" or \\"Intruder\\" his best attempt. Shame on David Byrne for not trying \\"Red Rain\\" or \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" or \\"Steam\\".<br /><br />But I digress...here we have \\"New Blood\\". Like other reviewers here have already stated, some of the orchestral arrangements supersede the original versions. Which ones? \\"Red Rain\\", \\"Intruder\\", \\"Darkness\\" and \\"Wallflower\\" are the most eligible candidates. Then there are those that equal their originals, neither outdoing them nor ruining them such as \\"The Rhythm Of The Heat\\", \\"San Jacinto\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Mercy Street\\", \\"Don't Give Up\\", \\"Downside Up\\" and \\"The Nest That Sailed The Sky\\". Then there are the questionable choices such as \\"Digging In The Dirt\\", \\"Blood Of Eden\\" and \\"Solsbury Hill\\". And then there's some kind of joke--\\"A Quiet Moment\\"--I mean really? Ambient sounds from Solsbury Hill for 4 minutes and 48 seconds? Ha, ha, Gabriel, ha, ha. Now I see that on some editions of \\"New Blood\\" there are versions of \\"Signal To Noise\\" and \\"Father, Son\\". I would have gladly deleted \\"The Nest That Sailed The Sky\\" and \\"A Quiet Moment\\" in favor of \\"Signal To Noise\\" and \\"Father, Son\\". Gladly.<br /><br />The more I listened to \\"New Blood\\" the more I enjoyed it. I really think Gabriel outdid himself on \\"Red Rain\\", and I really liked \\"Mercy Street\\". \\"Digging In The Dirt\\" is probably the most unusual song to arrange for an orchestra. It sounds awkward, but there's still something about it that works. \\"San Jacinto\\" and \\"Wallflower\\" work extremely well in orchestral form, almost as if they were written for an orchestra. \\"Intruder\\" is a revelation. Stripped down to an almost Hitchcock-like re-working, it has all the urgency of a suspense thriller. \\"Intruder\\" is definitely one of the best here, and I almost prefer it over the original. \\"In Your Eyes\\" is another tricky orchestral arrangement. The song does not easily lend itself to an orchestra, but there was something about it that worked here.<br /><br />Gabriel had originally intended back in 1986 to have Dolly Parton duet on \\"Don't Give Up\\". When I read that, I completely understood the song in a better perspective--I saw it as a country ballad. I could completely see Parton doing it. Well, Dolly, it's not too late to do a cover of \\"Don't Give Up\\" with Gabriel, now is it?! I could see Gabriel covering \\"Jolene\\" or even more interesting, \\"9 To 5\\"--that would be a hoot, now wouldn't it?<br /><br />The bottom line is this: \\"New Blood\\" like \\"Scratch My Back\\" is good, but...BUT, I'd rather have a new album of original material. I mean, what's the hold up? Got to be perfect, does it? Come on! It's almost been another decade Gabriel. Release the Kraken! I hear it's going to be titled I/O (input output). Out with it then. \\"Up\\" was not worth a 10 year wait, and it suffered as a result of such along gestation. I think Gabriel does best when he is more impulsive and intuitive rather than obsessive and perfectionist. \\"New Blood\\" is good, four stars or three and a half depending on how I am feeling.<br /><br />Here's how \\"New Blood\\" compares with Gabriel's previous work:<br /><br />1977 Peter Gabriel: Three and a Half Stars<br />1978 Peter Gabriel: Three Stars<br />1980 Peter Gabriel: Five Stars<br />1982 Peter Gabriel: Five Stars<br />1986 So: Five Stars<br />1992 Us: Four Stars<br />2002 Up: Four Stars<br />2010 Scratch My Back: Three and a Half Stars<br />2011 New Blood: Three and a Half Starsis more impulsive and intuitive rather than obsessive and perfectionist. \\"New Blood\\" is good, four stars or three and a half depending on how I am feeling.  Here's how \\"New Blood\\" compares with Gabriel's previous work:  1977 Peter Gabriel: Three and a Half Stars  1978 Peter Gabriel: Three Stars  1980 Peter Gabriel: Five Stars  1982 Peter Gabriel: Five Stars  1986 So: Five Stars  1992 Us: Four Stars  2002 Up: Four Stars  2010 Scratch My Back: Three and a Half Stars  2011 New Blood: Three and a Half Stars

B005KAH7QU|1.0|One of the worst movies I have endured for quite some time.  Don't fall for the 'perfect assassin' routine.  It's not about that....at all.  It's really a very, very, lousy coming of age movie.  This girl was sheltered from the real world until the movie starts.  After that, it's her confusion and lousy writing that make the movie.  Please, do yourself a favor, don't waste your dime.

B004RKXHZY|4.0|I enjoyed Lola and the Boy Next Door. It was sweet and entertaining. I loved the character Cricket. I didn't care that much for Lola. She seemed entirely too childish. It would have been better to make her a bit older and thus mature her character to a non-annoying level. But overall, it was a pleasant read. I think I enjoyed Anna and the French Kiss a lot more. I think the thing I appreciated the most out of the book was the insights into Anna and St. Clair's future after Anna and the French Kiss ended. But Cricket's self deprecation and quirkiness made him lovable and charming. I would still recommend it because in a world of predictable, uninteresting teen romances, this one really does have heart and something special, so GO READ IT!
B001AP11LQ|5.0|This is the White Stripes' first album and also perhaps their best. I like all of their albums, but this one was one of the best. It really represents the White Stripes' sound as a band. There are a lot of rock out, power-packed songs like \\"Jimmy The Exploder\\" and \\"Astro,\\" as well as some more mellow ones, like \\"Sugar Never Tasted So Good,\\" and \\"St. James Infirmary Blues.\\" If you're looking for a great blues/rock album, this is what you want. I definitely recommend it.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! Everything about it. It was interesting, romantic, heartbreaking at times, full of friendship, had characters that you could relate to, and well written. After reading it, it haunted me for days... taunting me to read it again. I did and it was just as good. After reading this (because let's face it, its a must!!!) read Lola and the Boy Next Door. It was good, not quite as good as Anna in my opinion, but it featured Anna and St. Clair as characters so you get to see what happened after Anna's story ended.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great App. Well done; polished and thoughtfully designed. Quite a bit more seamless than the previous app of this type that I have used in the past.

B006OFN0BQ|5.0|A scene at a clothing store in which John Edgar Hoover is told he has bad credit finds him telling them that they are incorrect, they must be speaking of another John Hoover. They ask if he is indeed John Hoover and he says yes but adds that he signs his name different ways, not usually just plainly as John Hoover but with his middle name or E initial included (his mother did always call him Edgar). The shop owner then tells Hoover to open up a new account and sign it with one name and to go by that name. John takes the application form and writes J. Edgar Hoover.  To me this scene is symbollic of the larger film. J. Edgar Hoover is a film about a man who, like many of us, had many sides and aspects that composed who he was. He was greatly conflicted about which side he should portray publicly and stumbled rather awkwardly in his younger years, illustrated wonderfully in the film, until finally deciding that J. Edgar Hoover was who he was going to be. That was the side he was going to live publicly and the person he was going to be, right or wrong, with full conviction. The rest of the film shows us the consequent problems, struggles and complications that follow from this choice.  I was concerned that this film wouldn't live up to my expectations, others have been rating it rather ordinary and others negatively, few seem really excited about it after having viewed it. In a way I can see where they are coming from. It is a long film with dark moody colors, almost as if Eastwood wanted it to be black and white, and a lot of dialogue that moves quite fast without much regard for helping the audience along or spelling things out. All that aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and while it didn't blow my mind or leave me with any great revelations about my own life it was a great movie experience and had me thinking and entertained the entire time I was watching it.   I'm not sure where all the more negative or critical reviews are coming from, perhaps people have highstandards from Eastwood and expected something groundbreaking, perhaps they just expected something different, but after all the negative or ho-hum opinions I had heard about this film I was pleasantly surprised and recommend it for fans of drama or biopics. I especially recommend it for those like myself who have been waiting for a more compelling film this movie-going season.  Perhaps I enjoyed it more because I have seen a truly terrible line of recent films in cinemas, Jack and Jill being the latest before seeing this (that movie was awful, so awful. I thought it would be bad but in an over the top funny way, it was just bad). So maybe my enjoyment was raised during this film because other recent films have left me underwhelmed and bored or wanting my money back. I haven't seen an excellently crafted film in theaters since The Help and haven't even thought one merited repeat viewings since the surprise that was 50/50. This film didn't knock me out but I will definitely watch it again and will likely even buy it on Blu-ray because I want it to be part of my collection and think it will become more engaging upon future viewings.  People are complaining about the old age make up, it never bothered me once despite other reviewer comments making me more critical than usual. People say there are many impersonations of presidents and such that are distracting, the only one that felt as much to me was Richard Nixon's brief appearance towards the end because it was so over the top. People say it drags, but I was never wanting for it to hurry or speed along, I was always compelled with what was on screen. There are complaints that the broken narrative is confusing and jumps too much, it's fairly straightforward with only two timelines occuring. Hoover in his old age is dictating his past for a manuscript and both these timelines are otherwise chronological and move forward with one another. People say there is no real message or overriding theme to speak of, I think deeper digging and repeat viewings will find them more well constructed than others are giving credit right now. Most of all though, even if some find merit to these criticisms I don't find that any of them would keep the film from being enjoyable as a whole.   This film may be getting less positive reviews because people thought it could have been so many things that it isn't. In the end I feel Eastwood and the writer picked a direction and identity for the film and much like J. Edgar they decided to move forward with full conviction. It is what it is and any negatives don't outweigh all the positives it brings in my opinion, but everyone will judge the film differently I suppose, much like everyone has different opinions on J. Edgar Hoover the man.  It may also help me that I'm very interested in history and this time period. Also in how institutions such as the FBI got built up and came to be (the film does an excellent job at explaining how the bureau slowly found ways to gain power and independence). Anyways, give this film a chance, I give it five stars because I may not have LOVED the film but I did love the experience of watching it, if that makes sense.

Sound quality is amazing, for both the new and old vinyls.

B000683VI4|1.0|I don't mind a sentimental movie, but this one is totally awful. Mainly because everything is so predictable. And I really mean predictable. Not a single twist or hint of complexity in the story. The story has some potential for small surprised but they, too, are given away very early in the movie.<br /><br />Some alternative love-story films that are made for adults: [[ASIN:B000YMDIZS The Yacoubian Building]], [[ASIN:B000NOKFHG Venus]], [[ASIN:B000H9A2XO Windstruck (ALL Region - Single Disc Edition) DVD]], and [[ASIN:B002W1HBM0 As It Is in Heaven]].

B005KLAA4A|5.0|Back in 2008, I wrote a review for 'Face Dances.' I slammed it, giving it two stars and deeming it one of The Who's weakest. At that time, I truly believed that it was. None of the songs resonated with me, Keith Moon wasn't on it, and I felt that the material was just plain weak. I listened to it in 2008, decided I really didn't like it, and I put it on the shelf for years and didn't even think twice about it.   Recently, I heard 'You Better You Bet' on radio. This isn't such a rare occurrence (it gets lots of airplay on classic rock radio it seems), but this time, something seemed to dawn on me. The track actually sounded great. It was the first time I really appreciated the song -- for years, I thought that song was truly when The Who \\"sold out\\" (no pun intended). But upon further listening, I found it to be a quirky, synth-driven new wave track. Since I have been going through a new wave phase lately (I've been listening to lots of Depeche Mode, Big Country, U2, New Order, Tears for Fears, The Police -- you get the picture), I decided to pull this one off the shelf again and give it a listen.  And boy am I glad I did. I was shocked at just how much I thoroughly enjoyed this record. Despite the fact that the synthesizers do sound a bit dated (this was 1981, remember -- lots of new things were happening in music in 1981), The Who still managed to churn in a record that still sounds good in early 2012. While many fans are quick to dismiss it (as I did), to them I say, \\"give it another chance.\\" I did, and I found it to be one of the most rewarding things I've done in a long time.  Now, I don't normally give things five stars (I'm a harsh critic, I know), but this record I think is deserving of it. There is not a single song in the batch I don't like. I love the quirky new wave of 'You Better You Bet' (one of the first videos ever played on MTV on August 1, 1981), and 'Don't Let Go the Coat' would be perfectly at home on the previous record, 1978's 'Who Are You.' JohnEntwistle gets two songs here, 'The Quiet One' and 'You.' For Who fans, Entwistle songs are always treats, and the fact that he gets TWO here is something worth celebrating.  'Another Tricky Day' is a great Townshend track featuring some fascinating lyrics (\\"Life seems such a worthless title  / But break out and start a fire y'all\\"). Townshend has always been an incredible lyricist (he penned 'Tommy'! How much more evidence of that statement do you need?), and his lyrics on this record are absolutely great.  The other turn-off for many people on this record is the drummer: Kenney Jones. Jones is best known to everyone outside of The Who for his work with The Small Faces and ultimately The Faces. He is not a flashy and flamboyant drummer like Keith Moon was; rather, he keeps the band in check and is absolutely impeccable at keeping time. Kenney Jones is absolutely the polar opposite of Keith Moon, and in a strange way, that might contribute to why this album works so well. As a drummer myself, Keith Moon is one of my absolute favorites, and he is a tremendous influence on my playing, but after hearing this album, Kenney was the perfect man for the job on this record. It is a shame that Roger Daltrey refused to let him back in the group in 1989 when the group was reuniting for the 20th anniversary of 'Tommy,' because Kenney Jones really is a fine drummer. He's not flashy, but his timekeeping is spot-on.  I also absolutely love the cover. It may very well be my favorite Who album cover; it, like much of the album, is quirky and colorful. The bonus tracks are also great, and I find it fascinating that the group was already performing 'How Can You Do it Alone' on the 1979 tour despite the fact that it would not be officially released until two years later. It sounds great live, as does 'The Quiet One.' 'I Like Nightmares' is also an interesting track, and one that probably would have fit perfectly on the original 1981 version (but I'm glad it is here as a bonus track).Look, I'll admit it. I was *way* too harsh on this record in 2008. This is The Who's hidden gem. Call me crazy, but it absolutely is. Sure, Keith Moon's not here, but Kenney Jones is absolutely stellar on this record. Don't judge this record because of the fact that there is a different drummer. 75% of the group was intact on this record, and the three surviving members (now two, due to the untimely death of Entwistle in 2002) sound awesome here.  Don't expect 'Tommy,' 'Who's Next,' or even 'The Who By Numbers.' If you liked 1978's 'Who Are You' and you are willing to give a non-biased listen (\\"Keith Moon's not on here, so it's not The Who\\" is the wrong attitude to take with this album), I'm willing to bet you'll at least find SOME moments on here that are worth mentioning. This is not a bad record. It is, for me, The Who's forgotten/obscure masterpiece. 'You Better You Bet' seems to be the only song that gets recognition here, which is a shame, because this is a fine record cover to cover.  (By the way, I know I am reviewing the Mini-LP version, but since I don't own the Mini-LP, I can't comment on it. I will say though that as somebody that owns plenty of mini-LPs that I'll bet 'Face Dances' sounds great as a mini-LP.)  I cannot recommend this record enough. If you listen to this record with an open mind, you just might like it.

B0014KD46W|5.0|I hadent read a review or ever listened to Nine Lives before I purchased the CD. Ive always enjoyed Steve Winwood and think the reason I like this CD alot is because of its chilled out sound that is very soulful and rich in the way that the rythms float me and excite me at the same time. I think steve in this album has also taken some afro beats similar to the way Paul Simon intergrates it into his music, at the same time it still has that familiar Steve Winwood feel especially on the song Dirty City where you can imagine him and Eric Clapton together. I think Im very lucky to be in this era of music. Thanks to amazon for being so careing and understanding I finally got to listen to this Cd.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its ok. and a good, way to pass time on my kindel so I think its pretty cool tabs I win
B004O3YGMC|1.0|DO NOT FALL FOR THIS! Got this for kindle fire and the app was slow and unresponsive. Wouldn't even let me open the start menu and when I tried clicking on any small icons nothing happened. They also fail to mention that if you can manage to play any of your videos the sound doesn't come out of your device it comes out of your laptop! Totally pointless...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game whole be the best game ever. !!!!!!!!!!  I love it so much I named my kindle after it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is quick and easy to play. its a little addicting when your suposed to be doing somehjng though. I'm overall satisfied.
1466401885|1.0|Why is that when a girl has one-night stands she's a slut and a guy does it he's a stud--or in this book, a misunderstood romantic hero? For a book written by a woman, this story is overflowing with horrible sexist stereotypes and the virginity requirement. The male lead, Travis is a man-whore. He'll sleep with pretty much any woman, but he's so not a slut because he's, well, a man. On the other hand, the women he sleeps with are frequently described oh-so eloquently as \\"bimbos\\" and \\"sluts.\\" And, of course, they are all humiliated after having sex with Travis because, surprise, he doesn't want relationships. It's the freaking 21st century, women have sex for fun too. Also, who's to say that they didn't sleep with Travis because he was easy to get into bed? Oh and, Travis claims to have standards too. He tells Abby that he's never slept with an \\"ugly\\" woman. Standards, sure. I don't know what puritan, misogynistic community the author came from, but there's a lot of slut-shaming and name-calling in this book.   Other thing is the \\"sex on a pedestal\\" virginity test. Travis finds Abby attractive because she's not like \\"other\\" women and would not sleep with him. Sure, there's nothing wrong with showing self-restraint and not being complete sluts, but that should be true for BOTH genders and not just for men. Abby is good because she defines herself against women who have sex and holds her own sexuality as a leash for men. You know, I'll have sex with you if you do this, I won't have sex with you if you don't do this and such. And she's a virgin, the perfect wife material because she hasn't been touched by another man. Ugh.   Well, that's the story basically. The writing is pretty amateurish; it's obvious that this is by a first-time author. I spotted several grammar and spelling mistakes so this book hasn't been professionally edited (Writing \\"you're\\" for your at one point; IPhone for iPhone, etc.)The characters are stereotypical and shallow. I've read plenty of storieslike this on fictionpress and I didn't have to pay a shilling.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome. it kicks butt! I enjoy this game very much! I would rate this game as five stars.
0374275637|3.0|Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman's contribution to human progress and knowledge cannot be understated.  He shared the Nobel Prize for Economics by demonstrating conclusively with his psychological experiments that humans are not the rational individual actors that Economics assumes us to be.  Instead of relying heavily on the logical, deliberate, and suspicious System 2, we rely mainly on the emotional, intuitive, and trusting System 1, leading to all sorts of \\"predictably irrational\\" behaviour (in author Dan Ariely's term).  But while he had the insight and courage to attack that awesome edifice that was Economics establishment thinking, he just isn't as fluid and fluent storyteller that Dan Ariely and Malcolm Gladwell are (both who draw heavily on Kahneman's work).  Also, as an academic, he was too focused on his particular specialty, without reaching out to the exciting and emerging field of neuroscience.  By studying closely the physical structure and mechanics of the brain, Kahneman would have been able to enhance his thinking and understanding of the brain.  Consider Kahneman's description of the brain as two separate, competing entities that often work together:  Systems 1 and 2, a formulation that is in popular jargon often referred to as \\"Right Brain\\" and \\"Left Brain.\\"  Neuroscientists know that this formulation isn't so clean and neat, and that a more accurate understanding of the brain is to understand its constituent parts.  The pre-frontal cortex is what controls executive function, such as judgement and reasoning (Kahneman's System 1 and Daniel Pink's \\"Left Brain\\"), and it's this small part of the brain that has allowed humanity to surpass all other species on the planet.    Kahneman makes the point that System 1 is under-utilized (humans are lazy --  it's a fact), and we rely heavily on System 2, which thinks in context, and is always attempting to build a narrative around disparate and often random facts and numbers.    Again, neuroscience offers acleaner and crisper explanation.  The brain expends a tremendous amount of energy, and in a world of scarcity (when calories where limited) the brain basically adapted by using as least energy as possible (such as intuitive thinking and jumping to conclusions, which expends a lot less energy than deliberate, analytical thinking) in the attempt to enhance the chance of survival as possible (getting along with members of your tribe).    A metaphor for this is how the eye sees.  We think when we see we see the whole picture, but what neuroscientists have discovered is that our eyes merely focus on the salient parts of the picture, and let memory draw and colour in the rest.  This leads to some absurdities.  For example, in the famous gorilla experiment, people were asked to count a number of basketball passes they saw on the television screen, and were so pre-occupied doing it that they completely ignored a man in a gorilla suit strolling back and forth on the screen.  Then there's also the experiment where people walked into an office to talk with a receptionist before entering the experiment, and when the receptionist switched into another person most people just didn't noticed.    For readers interested in psychology and behavioural economics, I suggest reading Dan Ariely's book \\"Predictably Irrational,\\" which takes the same ideas presented in this book, but presents it in a much crisper and livelier fashion.

B004EPYZXK|3.0|\\"Found footage\\" horror films are a dime a dozen these days are words well spoken. Seems everywhere you look that some director is going that route. Sometimes, it makes me wish there was never a Blair Witch Project ever made for everyone to follow. Course, there was and, like remakes, it's something everyone is doing to make a buck filmwise these days. Despite that, there have actually been some original ones that were worth the effort to be made. So, where does Apollo 18 fit in, in all this?<br /><br />Apollo 18 tells the story of a covert moon landing. The crew is tasked with setting up security cameras around the moon for national security reasons that are kept secret. While one is left in orbit, two of the astronauts land on the moon and begin their mission. Yet, during their mission, strange events begin to happen that suggest they are not alone there. When they come across a soviet ship, they assume that it is the soviets causing these strange events but they, all too soon, find out that it is something else.<br /><br />I'll admit, I was taken in by the story. For the most part, the movie provided an ominous, spooky atmosphere. The way the movie was made actually made it seems like it was the 'real' thing..with all its' camera angles and different perspectives. It really drove home til....&lt;SPOILER ALERT> we find out that that 'something else' was actually killer alien rocks(huh?)? Wha..? Mmmkay. I could buy killer aliens...or them coming across some other alien conspiracy...but killer alien rocks(and that's why they took samples from the moon)? Come on. I was expecting this really big payoff and this is what it amounts to? I was disappointed. That reason alone is why I gave the film only three stars.<br /><br />Apollo 18 is a decent movie, mind you, and I do recommend it. Just don't expect it to be something it ain't. It could've been something much more if the director put forth the effort. As it stands, as far as I'm concerned, it's one of the better made 'Found Footage' movies in a long line of movies like that.und Footage' movies in a long line of movies like that.

0062082353|1.0|Whether it is during war time or not, I find it disgusting as a human being that someone would be proud of holding a record for murdering 150 people.  What is even more disgusting is that this pathetic excuse for a human would then write this book and try to profit off it.  I mean, why can't Charles Manson or Ted Kazinsky write books about their horrible crimes?  Clearly this piece of trash can.    Also, his anecdote about punching Jesse Ventura is obviously a lie, seeing that nobody can seem to confirm it's authenticity.  It is nothing more than a cheap ploy to sell more of his sinful books.    May God have mercy on his soul.
B005R32L66|3.0|This app is a lifesaver. It's my only means of communication with my boyfriend overseas. However, startup is a pain. It takes a minute for it to load the old conversation (I wish there was an option to not load) and during that time I cannot receive msgs. Also sometimes the app crashes while trying to load them. Audio could be better, but that may just be me phone, video seems good.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Finally... The application I have been looking for!... Download this now!!! Works almost perfect on my vizio tablet,(a little trouble with text entry on websites)... Also works seamlessly with my casio commando.. Over lan and cell tower... I haven't touched my laptop all day.. (no need to anymore). I have however been using my laptop all day... Wonderful app..!!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game.  Not as easy as it looks.  You have to use your mind to figure out the paths. Hard to put down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game to play on my lunch breaks, but might be too easy... and gotta love the price! hee hee
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love this case! Super lightweight, fairly protective. I wish there was a way to snap the case closed not just use the strap, that may be the only negative I can think of at this point. I might think about getting a film for the front but if it's Gorilla glass, why should I need one? Just in case I suppose. I really enjoy the strap as the Fire is heavy!
0811874192|5.0|I got this item for my grandmother who absolutely loved it!  It is a beautiful book and everyone that saw it wanted to know where I got it.  This isn't something you see everyday and it's great for anyone who loves flowers!  It is also great for someone who is limited with storage space.

B004LWZW4W|1.0|This is a review of the film, not the actual bluray product:  I'm not used to being in the minority for like vs. dislike of a movie as I am pretty easily entertained.    Visually this movie is something to behold, the CGI for the animal \\"acting\\" and facial expression is so good, it's creepy.  That's the only thing worth watching, though.  The rest, the real actors, the story... it's so bad that I want to do a drive by return to the video store that I got it from. As in: fling it at the door as I drive by (even though I know it's not their fault)  I am genuinely confused by all the good reviews this movie got.  This is only the 2nd time I have ever felt mislead by fellow Amazonians so I feel obligated to warn others.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|I was hooked by the details of espionage.  The characters became important to me.  Also, I was intrigued at how the author used the mother's story to manipulate the daughter's story.  A really good read...even if you think you've figured out some of the answers...it's still a really good read.
006016848X|4.0|Wow! I was really surprised by the relatively negative reviews of the book. Many folks said that the views were oversimplified and redundant. While this may well be true, you have to admit that the book did get some people talking to each other. Even if only a simple common ground was achieved, as long as it helped the relationship, then it was successful. Talking to each other certainly helps a relationship far more than silence and misunderstanding. Yes, men and women are different! We do tend to see things differently. Acknowledging this fact is the purpose of the book. }:o)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is simply the best one of it's kind I tried so far. The best one by far I mean. Keep it up.

B000F7CMRM|5.0|--SPOILER ALERT--  \\"Syriana\\" is just one fictional epic journey among thousands that your govt and oil industry have taken for you in order to comply with your demands for gasoline and fuel oil.  Its a journey of deliciously good greed, globally winning corruption, absolutely minimized collateral damage, and the wonderful people at the middle-top of the Great American Empire who already have a place in Neo-Con Heaven.  The American people have dictated this path for their govt and oil industry with their demands for gasoline and heating oil.  We-the-fascist-corporatism are just the innocent little church mouse in this terrible situation.  We've tried, cried, and yelped for help from the people, but there's no help coming.  So we do the best we can with what little we have.  Here's \\"Syriana\\", one magnificient story detailing (DETAILING) what we have to do to get what the people demand.  See for yourself how we manage our resources with an astronomical amount of honor, an absolute minimum of human anguish, and only a tiny amount of unfortunate wholesale slaughter.  Of course we can't name names or places, or identify anything anywhere, but we give you all the details worth reporting.  And, of course, we have to scoot the story around a lot so that our enemies can't figure out what we're doing to them or what we're doing to defend ourselves, but you'll fit it all together.  I wouldn't have had that take on \\"Syriana\\" without watching the DVD's special features.  Going through those special features is a jaw-dropper.  The players and filmmakers really do want to sell that drivel.  They're trying to persuade us that the fascist-corporatism of Big Oil and U.S. govt are the good guys.  They want us fit all the fragments of \\"Syriana\\" together so that corporatism comes out looking good, and so that it must not come out looking any way but good.  BUT NO, IT CAN'T BE DONE.  \\"Syriana\\" is somebody's cutsey idea of playing CYA for Big Oil and its govt puppets.  \\"Syriana\\" is so deep into sophistic fictions that, once real-world truths are laid alongside the film's sophistic fictional lies, there's nothing that fits together in there except dishonor, corporate greed, human anguish, political corruption, and needless death.  And that's after you try to make it work as a story of how the good, honorable people tried, and tried, and tried -- but, oops, missed it by just that much, when the CIA-launched missle nails the good-guy CIA dude (George Clooney's Bob Barnes) and the good-guy Arab prince (Alexander Siddig's excellently-played Prince Nasir Al-Subaai) in the same boom.  Good-honorable doesn't work -- nuuhh uuuhh.  What works is the same depraved persuasion fronted by sophistry that Big Oil has been hitting us with since John D. Rockefeller.  Classical rhetoric's persuasion is based on truth and ethical intent.  Human community works best when persuaded with truth.  Classical sophistry's persuation is based on plausible falsehoods and unethical intent.  There are lies in any sophistry--no matter how plausible--intended to make the bad guys look good.  From the fall of the kings in ancient Greece and Rome, about 500 BCE, sophists made fortunes for themselves and their clients--both in the lawcourts and in teaching their students how to bend lies into softness and nearly into truth.  Machiavelli picked it up in the 1500s.  Then, in 1776, the American monied elites, Jefferson's ever-arrogant \\"natural aristocracy\\", found themselves standing squarely in the time warp that made sophists right for them, too.  It took me several viewings to get all the way around \\"Syriana\\".  There's so much sophistry--and the sophistry is so well executed and so chopped up with fractured storytelling and chop-away editing--that, initially, the sophistries kept pointing me off.  I'm just not accustomed to that level of sophistication in sophistry hurling.  Haven't seen its like since my last reading of Alexander Hamilton's writings in the \\"Federalist Papers\\".  Usuallysophistry comes at me in sophmoric mental vomit chunks, dropping away from the main spew, allowing sidestepping and chunk labeling on the fly.  Most sophists today are unskilled sophomores.  Remember now, you can't find the word, 'sophistry', correctly defined in any dictionary published after about 1776.  That's when it became important to the U.S. monied elites to neuter and de-horn classical sophistry into something more modern and less threatening to their bamboozling of ordinary Americans.  They didn't need ordinary citizens springboarding from Aristotle and Cicero's anti-sophistry writings to Machiavelli's 1532 preachments on deception in \\"The Prince\\", and on into their own deceptions.  The wonderful \\"Gentlemen\\" judges who denied the rights of the rabble to instruct their legislatures--from 1776 to 1786--deserved protection.  It was our first national debate, and it was bitter.  It was so acromonious that most of the winners' text books today don't even mention it.  To find its descriptions, you have to get into really esoteric history books, such as Gordon S. Wood's 1969, \\"The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787\\", published for the Institute of Early American History and Culture at Williamsburg, Virginia.  (If you don't read another book in your life, read that one.  Bring a jaded eye.  Wood sides with the bad guys.)  In 1750s-1780s America, instructing legislatures was an imperfectly understood fragment of direct democracy from the Roman Republic.  However, instructing legislatures was Republican theory tenaciously grasped by ordinary Americans.  The \\"Gentlemen\\", in 1776, saw that it could ruin pie-in-the-sky fortunes for coming generations of future \\"Gentlemen\\", who had the natural right to take whatever wealth and power they could.  (Still think they do.)  'Instructing legislatures' needed to be stamped out right now.  Against the dogged refusals of the rabble to knuckle under to the ever-arrogant Gentlemen, there was nothing left to do but to hit them with vacuous arguments, deluxe sophistry, and tyrannical power.  Then, just in the nick of 1786 time, up jumped Alexander Hamilton, the Great Falsehood--self-serving suck-up hero to generals and the superrich, Grand Master of Black-Arts Sophistry.  He would deliver the Gentlemen and untold generations of their progeny into control of their fates.  He would deliver mastery over the commoner-rabble and all the industries that the Gentlemen could ever invent -- gold in the Plains Indians' sacred Black Hills and the black gold of Big Oil, for two examples.  The line from Hamilton's 1786 sophistry to the \\"Syriana\\" sophistry fending for Big Oil and the Great American Empire is unbroken and linear.  Hamilton scurried around to all the right people, autumn 1786, setting up the \\"Federal Convention\\" (read, Constitutional Convention) for summer 1787.  The rabble's right to instruct their legislatures went soundlessly moot.  The Constitutional Convention would settle everything.  Then, from May to September 1787, Hamilton honcho'd the \\"Federalist\\" faction at the Constitutional Convention.  He dotted the eyes and crossed the tees that ensured slavery made it over the abyss, that the rabble could never control the Gentlemen's govt (e.g., judges made independent so that the superrich could easily buy them), and that this new Constitution would illegally and unconstitutionally side-step the standing Constitution's deadly requirements for any amendment of its fundamental law.  Convention delegates who were offended by gross denial of truth were driven off (setting a tradition that still holds today --bad guys stay to drive good guys away).  Commoner rabble giving instructions to the Gentlemen's National Congress?  Not ever, sir.  I'm winging it here, of course. Lots of ground to cover between \\"Syriana\\", its very sophisticated sophistry, and our national beginnings, with their very sophisticated sophistry.  The ground is already stuck together for all time.  We've just got towing over it so that you can see the unbroken connection.  Sophistry is how the monied elites have always led ordinary Americans around by the nose, misleading us into thinking that we're free--so that we can be more thoroughly enslaved to them and their progeny.  Black Arts sophistry is lying with the appearance of telling the truth.  Ordinary Americans of the Revolutionary Era trusted the educated \\"Gentlemen\\"--their leaders in the War--to give them the govt promised in the Declararion Of Independence (DOI)--their very own sentiments put down on paper by Thomas Jefferson.  It was about self-evident truths and inalienable rights.  Govts deriving just powers from the governed, and with their direct consent.  Govts not complying altered or abolished by order of the people as a matter of right and duty.  New govts having restrictions and limits dictated by order of the people and based on nothing more than the people's pleasure.  The DOI was the central propaganda of the War, read at most military and civilian gatherings, nailed to buildings far and wide.  Think major recruiting poster.  You join us, you get to kill tyrannical Englishmen, and you get to have this perfect govt.  One of my 5-g grandfathers, Jonas Butterfield, Dunstable, Mass, suckered for the punch.  Like all patriots, he and his family endured deep war-time hardships for the sake of the DOI's ideal govt.  The comparison between the first paragraphs of the DOI and the govt delivered in the 1787 Constitution engineered by Hamilton and the good ol' boys is Proof One.  They did us wrong.  What Hamilton and his Federalist deceivers gave ordinary Americans in the 1787 Constitution was the contradiction of the govt promised in the DOI.  It was a deep betrayal of the war-torn patriots and their progeny.  It was a govt intended to preserve the superrich and their parasites forever--tyranny, simply put.  It was dispicable behavior by the \\"Gentlemen\\" heaped onto ordinary Americans, slavery and all.  Hamilton showed them the way.  We also have the \\"Federalist Papers\\".  They're Proof Two.  They're Hamilton's vacuous arguments, incredible sophistic lies, and clear mis-uses of obscure Aristotlean logic forms--all designed to blind ordinary Americans while leading them into the trap govt that would ensure superrich domination forever.  Roll on, St.Burr.  Yes, I'm the one who sainted Aaron Burr in 1969 for his fatal shooting of Hamilton, the Great Falsehood, in 1804.  I'm not alone in my sentiments.  John Adams, 2nd U.S. President, also read Hamilton in the \\"Federalist Papers\\" and knew his character better than me.  In 1815, Adams wrote that Hamilton was \\"the most restless, impatient, artful, indefatigable, and unprincipled intriguer in the United States, if not in the world\\".  (He was commenting on Gen Washington's taking of Hamilton as his 2nd in command, while rejecting St.Burr's application to be a lowly Brigadier General, War of 1812, because St.Burr was an intriguer.)  St.Burr, one vote from being the 3rd U.S. President and still the sitting 3rd U.S. Vice-President when he gunned down Hamilton, was a man whose few, stand-tall principles conflicted with most others of his \\"Gentlemen\\" class.  He believed women were the equal of men--taught his daughter several languages and how to shoot from horseback.  He believed that slavery should be abolished, bringing a bill to that effect when he was elected to the New York State Assembly, 1784--some 79 years before Lincoln did the deed.  He was deeply tied to truth.  Talked the talk AND walked the walk.  He believed that dispicable behavior from a \\"Gentleman\\" was too dishonorable to be allowed.  It was that last bit that pulled Hamilton by his forked, dispicable tongue into the long grind to the famous duel with St.Burr, who put a 54-caliber ball through Hamilton's liver.  This, despite Hamilton's strategem of supplying pistols--his right as the one challenged--that had concealed single-set triggers.  We have one of the original pistols, and replications have been produced.  They are Gentlemen's pistols, but not proper dueling pistols.  They look normal enough.  There's just one trigger in each.  No suspicious buttons, levers, or latches, as appear on some set-trigger pistols of the period.  True to Hamilton's devious character, however, there's a trick:  push trigger forward to set.  Counter-intuitive, as are the truths that lay hidden in the tightest of sophistries.  Pistol triggers are for pulling to you, not for pushing away.  Hamilton was too street-dumb to think that wiley, war-wise St.Burr might know about these widely-used pistols owned by Hamilton's brother-in-law.  Certainly, in Hamilton's conniving mind, St.Burr would not know to push the trigger forward one click to set it for a half-pound-pull, avoiding the 10-12-pound pull of using the trigger un-set.  Hair trigger means more accuracy than heavy trigger.  Ha-ha, Hamilton had his hated nemesis now, on that bright Wednesday New Jersey morning, 11 July, Weehawken dueling ledge, near the river.  St.Burr is silent on the issue.  We'll never know for sure.  We do know that Hamilton fired first, very quickly, and that his ball went high and wide, smashing branches above and behind St.Burr.  Did he mis-trigger?  Serves him right, if he did.  His shot was the go for St.Burr, who aimed to kill, and killed--to paraphrase Gore Vidal's admirable 1976 novel, \\"Burr\\".  St.Burr's stand-tall principles put him far outside the mainstream and made him an easy target.  So, of course, Hamilton's boosters--the superrich and their parasites--smeared St.Burr, the notorious assassin, with everything they could reach for a couple of decades.  Under that heavy smear is pretty much where St.Burr's reputation lays today.  (But see especially, Nancy Isenberg, \\"Fallen Founder: The Life Of Aaron Burr\\", 560 pages, 2007.  It's been called \\"a necessary and overdue corrective\\" by one reviewer--not myself.)  Okay, first we'll bury the whole notion of 'sophistry'.  We'llpublish definitions of it in all the dictionaries.  The new definitions will cut it down to a quaint harmlessness.  Ordinary citizens should never know which way is up.  If the U.S. monied elite are good at anything, it's buying whatever they want--politicians, judges, professors, publishers, along with \\"ships, and shoes, and sealing wax\\"--what the walruses preach to gullible oysters.  Of course, the monied elites can't hide classical sophistry from students of philosophy and logic.  There's just too much information in too many literatures bearing on the 1st and 2nd Sophistics.  Those are sophistry activity periods roughly lumped around the lives and anti-sophistry writings of Aristotle and Cicero, respectively.  Both men were adamant that truth is a necessary attribute of human community.  Both expressed the human need for truth in many ways.  Both have many adherents who speak and write in many languages.  (Yes, I know.  Cicero is too slippery to put up at Aristotle's level.  But it was a 2nd Century CE sophist who named Cicero to the 2nd Sophistic, so truth deals the hand.)  Additionally, there's modern-day cook-book logic.  It's course-work for college freshman, which, all by itself, shreds and blows up sophistry by the numbers.  (Do they still teach that course of truth tables, Aristotlean syllogisms, set theory, and Venn diagrams?  Measures of truth.  Freed my post-military, straight-jacketed brain and gave me wings.)  Forget dictionaries for 'sophistry'.  Go straight for George Kennedy's translation of \\"Aristotle: A Theory of Civic Discourse\\", Oxford Univ Press, 1991.  Kennedy's translation is unique in the world of philosophy.  It's an exercise in English language clarity that requires no previous study by the reader into the rigors of philosophy or the Greek language.  Kennedy is a teacher.  It's a 312-page text, but Kennedy needs only about 97 pages to teach the reader (Aristotle's) classical persuasion's \\"logos\\" (evidence in fact or in truthful argument), \\"ethos\\" (expressions of the laudable character of the principal person or persons), and \\"pathos\\" (creation of emotion in the observer that is favorable to the attempted persuasion and to the principal person or persons).  Those elements of persuasion are the same for both classical rhetoric and classical sophistry.  However, as advertised, classical rhetoric's persuasion is based on truth and ethical intent.  Classical sophistry's persuation is based on plausible falsehoods and unethical intent.  As Aristotle says, sophistry is a matter of the deliberate choice of specious arguments.  No wiggle room.  (See Kennedy, p. 36, in section 14.)  Don't worry about how to handle sophistry.  There's a falsehood in there, no matter how plausible.  Pull out the lie and the whole thing unravels.  Find the lie.  The mis-steps to our sophistry-laden step-off into American govt are especially germane to \\"Syriana\\" because the motivation was and is the grabbing of our money and the power that money provides.  We're sitting on 224 years of connected, anti-American sophistry.  Grabbing money and power was Hamilton's job in the Constitutional Convention and in the \\"Federalist Papers\\".  Fair readings of the extant delegates' journals at the Convention--kept behind closed doors--and of the \\"Federalist Papers\\", show that Hamilton was up to his eyeballs in money- and power-grabbing sophistries.  Slavery?  No problem.  It's profitable for the \\"Gentlemen\\"  Citizen rights?  What citizen rights?  Oh, you won't agree to the Constitution without them?  Magna Carta?  500 years ago?  How brazen of you, sir.  How rude and insulting, sir.  We'll fight you every inch of the way--deviously and behind your backs, of course, as is our way.  (The Bill of Rights could have been much more than what it is.)  Grabbing money and power is also the \\"Syriana\\" screenplay's job.  It's there to persuade us that all the good greed and winning corruption performed by the fascist-corporatism of Big Oil and U.S. govtis necessary to get us what WE DEMAND in gasoline and fuel oil.  It's all OUR FAULT.  It's there to put us off just one more month, one more year, one more decade.  Let the good times roll the money on in.  Hocus-pocus.  You will not remember the politician-spewed promises of alternative energy sources made since Nixon's 1971 howler.  You will not remember Clinton's snuffing, about 1996, of the Office of Fuels Development (under the National Renewable Energy Laboratory).  It was the agency that discovered that we could get 100-percent of our annual over-the-road fuel needs from algae-biodiesel grown in an American desert and burned in standard diesel engines.  No more Gulf-region dependency.  Clinton used fascist-corporatism like a club to preserve Big Oil's way of life in the global oil fields and in global terrorism.  So far he's helped them to get about 16 more years of unquestioned, unprosecuted time and money.  Fortunately for all of us, smart people at the Univ of New Hampshire remembered the algae-biodiesel advancements of that little, seemingly insignificant agency.  Hocus-pocus.  You will only remember the confused and chop-away-editing stew of \\"Syriana\\" sophistry--where greed is good, corruption is why we win, and terrorists get to murder innocents across the world with weapons we supply because our oil interests in the Gulf region demand that we sell terrorists such weapons.  (How else would fascist-corporatism get US military grunts to fight and die for Big Oil profits?  I mean, now that Weapons of Mass Destruction are no longer on the table.  Remember WMDs?  No, I didn't think so.)  The blatant fascist-corporatism sophistry of \\"Syriana\\" is a dispicable insult to my intelligence.  And that's after I've acknowledged that \\"Syriana\\" is just a fictional story, nothing more.  I can only hope that many others have similar sensibilities and reactions.  You should sit through a few showings of \\"Syriana\\" to get a finger-tip feeling of what sustained sophistry looks like.  More importantly, it can show you the difficulty of finding the sophistic lies at first glance.  Against sophisticated sophistry, you have to look all the way around the front and the back, and then bring in outside counter-examples.  Stay real.  Question everything.  Drive it all through shaped charges of logic and reason with critical thinking.  Pull it all through the highest levels of intellectual honesty, where belief systems are not allowed.  Remember Bertrand Bussell:  \\"People would rather die than think--most do.\\"  Other than Tim Blake Nelson's Danny Dalton and his misrepresentation of Milton Friedman's Nobel Prize--in his \\"corruption is why we win\\" speech--there's nothing in \\"Syriana\\" to really nail down as a falsehood.  It's all a fiction to start with.  The exercise in the difficulty of nailing down sophistic lies on-the-face-of-it makes watching \\"Syriana\\" a worthy exercise.  You have to go outside \\"Syriana\\" to demonstrate the sophistic lies presented inside \\"Syriana\\".  You have to do the same with the \\"Federalist Papers\\" in many of its sophistries.  Of course, turning your sophistry analysis to the \\"Federalist Papers\\" might require that you go up a few skill-sets--given 18th Century English-language usages, intense political history, and Hamilton's skillful use of the more obscure elements in Aristotlean logic.  Still, from the springboards of the Kennedy text and cook-book logic, it's do-able.  American society and its human communities need to grasp the whole run of sophistry in our national history.  It's knowledge that can prevent on-going nose-leading and pick-pocketing.  And, in the end, it's the showing off of that on-going element for which \\"Syriana\\" should be prized.  Hey, us and them are pretty much the same since 1787.  More's the pity.  --spib, 07 Jan 2012.
B005L3HJ8M|4.0|I'm a big vinyl buyer, purchasing 90% of my music in the media over the last two years. I was excited to hear the new direction of Coldplay after I thoroughly enjoyed Viva la Vida, and the music doesn't disappoint. The men have a unique knack for creating new sonic territory without sounding like a completely different band. You can tell each song is a Coldplay song on this album, but the album as a whole feels fresh from all of their others.<br /><br />One word of caution: Don't go for the vinyl. It's a bit of a waste. $21 for a single pressed vinyl record free of digital download or excellent packaging. There's no CD accompaniment. You literally get one record and that's it. Unlike so many other artists that reward vinyl purchasers with extras, Coldplay and their record company seem to have missed the boat on this one.<br /><br />As I said, the music is worth the purchase, just get the digital copy instead.
B006JCC1GO|3.0|Its not very interesting. Not much to do. The piano game has no real meaning to anything. Its pretty boring.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it gives a wide verity of games for people to play on their electronic devices. It's really fun to play.
0312641893|5.0|I feel obligated to begin this review with one comment: Holy epic series starter. This book has been hyped up in the blogging community, and beyond, for a few months now and I'm excited to share my thoughts. Before I began reading Cinder I had seen various 5 star reviews and sometimes when there's this huge bubble surrounding a new book and author I end up being disappointed, Cinder proved that theory wrong. I will never look at a hyped up book the same way again, I will welcome it whole heartedly.<br /><br />Cinderella is one of those stories that almost everyone knows. A version or retelling exists in most cultures, I know because I did a paper on it in college, and we all know how the story goes. That said, I think it's best to throw everything else you know about the old story away when you dive into this one, it is its own book filled with new and exciting characters that I absolutely adored. Cinder with her low self esteem, dreams, and hope for the future is a character a lot of people will fall in love with. And, I am happy to say that our story does have our prince charming, or more of a charming prince, but you have to read it to find out more about the other fantastic characters Marissa Meyer has dreamed up, including the wicked witch ;)<br /><br />The very human story about the prejudices and injustices found on all levels of society, worked so well in this book. Judging, ridiculing, and looking down on others for various reasons is a topic that can be worked into so many daily lessons for not only kids but adults as well. I think Cinder would be an excellent book group book, there is so much between the pages to analyze, dissect and discuss. As a teacher I really appreciate a book that will make you think about things in a new way, and from a different angle, and this book is just an overall prime example of fluid discussion worthy text.<br /><br />Marissa Meyer is my new hero, this woman (and her exquisite team at MacMillan) weaves a wonderful web of a story (it must be late, I'm resorting to alliteration). But, in all seriousness, it's true. This book flows beautifully and captures such intense subject matters such as plague, war, and death like no other author I've read.<br /><br />The setting and very presence of this light retelling is captivating. I'd describe it as dark and damp with streams of light filtering in, a little thing I like to call hope, especially when times are rough. I loved everything about this book, and will could rave about it all night. This beginning to what is sure to be an amazing series will no doubt be something everyone will be talking about soon enough, and I can't wait for the next book in this series.sorting to alliteration).

B004O3YGMC|5.0|this is a grate app. works perfect for me.you can control your pc from any place.very good app. I used it allot.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app helps me keep my reading on schedule.  I love the reminders and especially how it reads to me in whatever version I select.  I do wish it was available offline though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The best Bible app ever! I love everything about it! Every time its updated it gets better and better. I love it!
B005OK721G|5.0|Zoe Saldana is beautiful in face and body, and is a first rate actress. And this well filmed and acted non-stop action story will no doubt launch her into many more just like it. The scene at the beginning in Bogota makes a person want to thank the gods for placing them in America. I like name-the-gun movies with lots of explosions and dead bad guys, and that's what this movie is about. And what else comes from Colombia besides coffee? Most everyone represented in the movie is a soldier in the drug war, on one side or another. It's pure mindless enjoyment. There, I didn't tell any more than a preview.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app.  It is easy to navigate and I am really enjoying some off reading plans. Also it's super easy to share eith others.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the flexibility this app offers.  Choice  of versions, multiple reading plans,  And best of all, it's free.  I fully expected to have to pay for an app like this.  Keeps me on track for my devotional reading.
B00632KSXI|5.0|So this was one of those albums that you think would be cool to own on vinyl and it doesn't disappoint;  one of the best debut albums I have heard in years.  I pre-ordered and it arrived when promised (thank you Amazon).  Played it for the first time only to discover disk 2 was warped and there was pressing flaw one making Sail sound crappy .... boo ... but thanks again Amazon for the speedy return and replacement.  The replacement copy was flawless.  There isn't much in the way of inserts or frills with this pressing but the album art with it textured surface is fun and gives you a perspective you just wouldn't get with the CD.  With songs like \\"All I Need\\", \\"Jump On My Shoulders\\", and \\"Kill Your Heros\\" to back up the already over played \\"Sail\\" and \\"People\\" means you won't tire of listening to it many many times.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great game for Ipad. you couldn't buy a better solitaire game. Fun for free time! Game saves if you have to quit !
B006QPVH6O|4.0|i really enjoyed this movie....i thought it was entertaining & its always good to have a movie make you wonder whats really out there......some good suspense moments & good ending.........even though there wasnt a lot of gore it still kept my interest & was still a good solid sci fi movie...worth the rent :)
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a brest free game.  Works as well as any of the paid games. Do not like the constant pop up ads at the end for other games, but hey it is free.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|love the challenges, and the game play. can be highly addictive! so worth the space on my tablet. try the free version but i promise you will end up buying full version
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Does what it promises to do... Awesome! this app is worth a download for sure. I've been showing it off all day.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Enjoy the game.  If you just want to veg out, this game is for you.  Plus the challenge of unlocking other games.
B005HSL626|5.0|I haven't seen one inappropriate app on her at all.The only one I saw was the one for the fruit ninjas clothes
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It sounded too good to be true. But I downloaded it and...it really works! I have enjoyed my Kindle Fire for the past 40 days or so that I've had it, and, at $200, the Fire is worth every penny and then some. But naturally, no one would expect it to be a powerful, full-blown tablet. The Kindle has its limitations. But the Splashtop Remote Desktop now allows me to \\"borrow\\" some of the computing power of my MacBook Pro and do things that I would never expect to be doing on a Kindle.   I have some concerns about security, so am only using it when and where I know it's safe. That said, this is a winner.   A very cool app indeed. Thank you Amazon for making it available free of charge today!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Not sure what I'm going to use this for, but it seems to do all it claims it can do. To me one of the better free apps Amazon has offered.  I have it installed on a Nook Color running CM7 and a Samsung WiFi 5 inch tablet.  Seems to work fine on both.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works exactly as described. Works on Galaxy Nexus and Kindle Fire. Highly recommended! Amazing ability to control your desktop remotely.
0312641893|5.0|I've always had a soft spot for fairy tale remakes, but I must admit Cinderella was never my favorite. However, after reading Cinder, I just might change my mind. A spectacular read!<br />  It always bothered me that Cinderella acted like a doormat and never stood up for herself, but Cinder (Main Character) was entirely devoid of this problem. She knew who she was and new how she should be treated. And she expressed that while not grating on the reader. Kai (Romantic Interest, Also Prince of the Commonwealth) was developed in a way that made it clear he was a person and not just a Prince Charming. And with all the main and supporting characters I could perceive the motives behind their actions.<br />Characters: 5 Stars<br />  Marissa Meyer has crafted a story in a world so filled with detail and intrigue that I found myself reading straight through. With a plague, and a looming war with the Lunar people, the basic Cinderella story was very exciting. I did guess a big secret before it was revealed, but it was still fun to see the foreshadowing build on my hunch. I'm already counting down the days for the sequel, Scarlett, in 2013.<br />Plot: 5 Stars<br />  Cinder did not read like a debut. It read like maybe the fourth or fifth bestseller from an author experienced in where she wanted her book to go and the best way to get there. Cinder takes  place in the far future of China and I loved the mixture of past and future cultures. Very realistic,and I will be eagerly awaiting future books. (like seriously, you'd better move out of the way)<br />Style: 5 Stars<br /><br />Rating: 5 Stars
B0054JZC6E|1.0|well, this game started. out sounding cool. not so much. it was very boring. I dislike it. it wasvreally dumb.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|it requires the use of another calendar so what is the point? if I wanted to use another calendar, I would not have purchased this one.,
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good game some games are hard so u can not continue to play others bit overall challenging and fun get this app now

B0000BYM3K|4.0|BNW was an amazing comeback but they have outdone it. Bruce sounds much better vocally than he did on their previous, his voice recovered a lot. It's faster and more energetic also, their age shows less. It's harder to tell that the band's over 20 years old. Reminds me of Powerslave, especially on Wildest Dreams. I don't know what they did but it sounds like their young again, doesn't sound like they're in their mid-life. It's a little different, synthesizer in a few songs and it's very progressive. Dance of Death is an underestimated album, definitely a must have and it's a modern classic to me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have had my game for about a week and so far it has not been boring my favorite is serpant
B000063DI8|2.0|I wanted to like it but I still didn't. Lyrics, instruments, vocals are all bad. Fear of the Dark is when they shows potential again and it's a decent album, way better than No Prayer for the Dying. Adrian leaving the band was probably part of the reason why they went downhill. The '90s was a bad time for Iron Maiden and it would take until Brave New World for them to recover all the way. Even legends like Iron Maiden have made mistakes in their career. No Prayer For The Dying is by far, their worst with Bruce and the 2nd worst only to Virtual XI. However I've grown to like a few tracks like Tailgunner, The Assassin and Run Silent Run Deep but the rest is forgettable. It's a bad album overall but not horrible.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing! fun and it goes on. I can not see how you would get bored! thumbs up all around. I love this game.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|MI 4 gets the best film of the year, in my opinion. The series keeps getting better with every movie, Ghost Protocol is the most intense and entertaining MI to date. It's faster-paced than the first 3, more suspenseful and few slow parts. Production, directing, acting and graphics were all great.<br /><br />On assignment in Budapest to intercept a courier working for a person of interest code-named \\"Cobalt\\", IMF agent Trevor Hanaway is killed by assassin Sabine Moreau. Hanaway's team leader, Jane Carter, and newly promoted field agent Benji Dunn extract Ethan Hunt and Hunt's source Bogdan from a Moscow prison. Hunt is recruited to lead Carter and Dunn to infiltrate the secret Moscow Kremlin archives and locate files identifying Cobalt.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is pretty fun and addicting. I played it for about an hour and a half. and some games are easy and some games are hard
B00004TH7Z|4.0|After their downfall in the '90s, which wasn't bad at all but Brave New World is quite a bit better than their last 2 albums. Bruce and Adrian are back and it's how an Iron Maiden album should be. It's a solid album and a great comeback. The Blaze Bayley-era wasn't bad but this is their best since Fear Of The Dark. The Wickerman is a great opening track and the whole album's great, now I understand why it's one of their best selling albums to date. Dream Of Mirrors is another powerful song which is in my top 10 Iron Maiden songs of all time.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Amazing app. i use it as an idea folder for business. Also use on kindle to rate books and write short reviews and notes so I remember which books I liked and why.
B000063DIH|4.0|Bruce Dickinson started to change vocally here but it was their mid career and it was before the band really aged. It has some darker lyrics and a more mature sound to it. It starts off with a fast opening track, Be Quick or Be Dead which is very heavy and has a lot of speed metal in it. A few songs are slower and have a progressive sound to them with a dated early '90s production which gives the album a classic sound. It has some slower paced songs with progressive influences but it's mostly straight forward heavy metal and more stripped down than Seventh Son. The lyrics improved a lot after their lackluster effort, No Prayer For The Dying. Fear Of the Dark is a truly underrated album and I still listen to it regularly. Chains Of Misery, The Apparition, The Fugitive and Fear Is the Key are my favorites.
0545265355|5.0|What a treat to be able to go from Book One straight on to Book Three! The theme of an post acopolyptic world is all too realistic for comfort. I love all the characters, especially the young heroine, Katniss. Her naivite lends credence to the story line. Author Suzanne Collins takes the reader on a fascinating adventure filled with political undertones and the cynicism of humanity even after surviving unbelievable events.  I heartily reccommend to young teens and old survivors.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is great for free although the ads can get very annoying. it is a great way to pass the time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like that you can unlock lots of other games, but only if you play a lottttt to get enough points
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ehh its a pretty good game.  wish u could get all the games tho. would of been nice if the
0143118706|2.0|Let me start by saying that like everyone else, I loved Eat, Pray, Love.  I was excited to get this book and see what the next chapter in her life would be, expecting her witty humor and fun pearly words of wisdom...unfortunatly, it seems that she must have taken a bit of heat in her other book because she is constantly trying to be PC and starts a lot of things with \\"let me be clear and explain...\\".  I appreciate her difficult time while waiting to come back to the US, but I wish she was able to write from her heart and not try to please everyone.  I know in the beginning of the book, she dedicates it to 27 women, but you can almost hear the frustration in her writing, like she is being held back or forced.  I still think she is fabulous and I am looking forward to the next book' just hope its all in her own voice :)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|this is freakin cool. In minutes i was connected to my mac and pc. Works well...  Screen resolution is customizable too which is nice....  Galaxy tab 10.1 android 3.2

B0052GACNM|5.0|We are pre-babyboomers.  My wife wanted a Tony Bennett album for Christmas.  I got her this one and she loves it even thought she admits she would never buy a Lady Gaga album.
B005GVF95O|5.0|My 3 year old grandson and 2 year old granddaughter love this, and they figured out how to do it rather quickly.  It keeps them busy while I get other things done. It dings when they get the piece in right and applauds them when they are finished. Something every child loves to hear.  I highly recommend for little ones.
B005DZMODI|5.0|We are not jazz purists but we love this album.  Fits well with the rest of our small jazz collection.
B004JYTWY8|5.0|After a decade of \\"living la vida loca\\" and then total absence, Ricky is back with a new brand of his amazing international rhythms in this new album.      While his first single, \\"Lo Mejor de mi Vida eres Tu\\", is a bit out of character with a  mesh of jazzy reggae sounds, the rest of this album has a more modern latin vibe with really great melodies.  Ricky sounds amazing as he sings his personal messages in \\"No Te Miento\\" and \\"Basta Ya\\", and still manages to rock out in songs like the title track, \\"Mas\\" and the reggaeton of \\"Frio\\" with Wisin and Yandel.  He gives you hope in \\"Sera Sera\\", shows his humanitarian compassion in \\"Cantame tu Vida\\" and then powerful passion in \\"Te Busco y Te Alcanzo\\" as he takes you with him to so many musical places in his songs.  This album shows truly amazing personal growth and presents a new musician that is still the same old friend. Ricky is back and better than ever! And most importantly, he still makes you want to dance!!!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Upgraded from a default AMD Phenom II cooler to this CPU cooler and noticed significant CPU noise and temperature reduction. The cooler is monstruous and my mini-tower case barely closes! Installation is doable (since I was able to accomplish it successfuly, having never installed a CPU cooler before) with only a few issues: First, the instruction is written in such a small font and I ommitted to slightly change the position of the screws in screw holes in the top plate, to fit my AM3 socket dimensions; Doing so _after_ I already applied the thermal paste and placed the cooler on my processor was not a nice experience. Also, the instruction reads \\"Do not remove the isolation from the back plate\\"; I did not see any isolation to begin with and I was confused whether I should have left the default back plate (with a visible white isolation) where it was and combine it with the new back plate. Fortunately, it appears that that there is an \\"invisible\\" isolation enbedded in the supplied back plate and the default back plate does not have to be used.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a good quality remote desktop app. High res. and it has a good U/I. I'm very impressed with this app.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game is challenging . you have to rethink direction. which sometimes is rather hard lol. try it you may like it.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|i was surprised to find the ADELE package  to contain a dvd and the cd of her outstanding performance at Royal Albert.She not only entertained but gave us many an insight into the girl she has become as she wrote the songs and used that instrument of a voice to take us on that journey.The variety od tone and tune has enlivened my music collection and keeps me buzzing
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun games good way to waste time and its free what could be better bla bla bla bla bla just wanted the free.points
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app very simple to use and set up.Navagation was pretty smooth.Oh if your having trouble connecting to a address just use your gmail login.
B005D9B9K8|4.0|A very well done video.  It is the next best thing to actually being there.  This video is able to capture the emotion and sounds of the concert.  Well worth adding to your collection especially if you are a Robbie Williams fan.
B0063GORYU|5.0|spider is a lot of fun and this is app runs really well. love that such a nice app is free too!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|My wife bought the kindle fire for Christmas and boy do I enjoy it. This Bible app is wonderfully and very easy to operate and I would recommend this to anyone who needs quick access to the word on the go. Thank you for this app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is not a bad app for being free...I like how unique. each game is and you kind of get addicted. to opening more and more new games. I play on kindle fire, I am not really sure how well these games would do on a phone though. My favorotes so far are the ones that have been the hardest to beat, like air hockey and snake.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun little game if you are looking for an easy game to pass the time and don't want to commit to something
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great way to get a bunch of mini games for free. great way to waste time and just a lot of fun
0553802534|5.0|This book \\"Alone\\" captured me by the title alone. Many of us have felt alone during some of the most difficult times of our lives. The main characters in this novel were alone when this story took place. It is basically the story of a woman married to a very rich and abusive man. One night, she calls the police when her husband is on a rant with a gun in his hand. He is consequently shot by a policeman named Bobby Dodge. From that moment on, all sorts of questions arise. Was the woman's life truly in danger? Did Bobby Dodge know this woman? Did he kill her husband deliberately? Were he and the woman planning on living off the proceeds? The book takes us on a rollercoaster ride of media speculation, and we are given a glimpse of what it must be like to be a policeman who is forced to make a split-second life and death decision. I loved this novel, but I will admit that I was surprised by the ending. I will read more Lisa Gardner novels. She not only promises, she also delivers!
0689835604|3.0|My daughter is 9 months and likes the book. The only thing is she rips the flaps like nothing! My husband has already fixed three flaps. They are on pretty good once we tape them back on so it's not a big issue. Maybe they should have made them with velcro or something since babies pull on pages? Cute book but make sure you have tape :)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Easy to set up and use. Had it all setup within minutes. Looks great on my Samsung Infuse's 4.5 inch screen. Highly recommend.
1423140591|5.0|Amazing book! The best book by Rick Riordan, but I haven't quite finished reading yet. Can't wait for next one already.
B0038P59A0|4.0|I love the actors, cinematography, costumes, set design but the plot left me a little cold.  It was fun to watch but not memorable--a few months later and I can't remember what happened in the movie except for a few scenes.  If you like Sherlock Holmes, this time period and Robert Downey Jr., Jude Law and Rachel McAdams you'll probably enjoy the show.  I'm glad I watched it, but it's not one of my favorites for this genre.
B000001DYY|4.0|It is the first CD of the group after the departure of Curt Smith, who returned later. The CD is good, but there are better ones in my opinion (at least three: \\"Songs From The Big Chair\\",\\"Raoul And Kings Of Spain\\" and \\"The Seeds Of Love\\"). The recording is good with the beat of striking Orzabal and it's worth the work.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Forces close on LG optimus v. Tried reinstalling but it always forces close after accepting the user agreement.would of been great if it worked
B00005JNJV|5.0|A dramatic view into the beginnings of the caped crusader with all the cause and effect relationships well in place.<br /><br />Familiar faces of Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman appear alongside that of Liam Neeson, who plays the not-so-benign mentor of Bruce Wayne. Wayne or Batman must discover his villainous character sooner or later if Gotham City is to survive.<br /><br />The story ends with a casual introduction to the \\"Joker\\"--an insight into what is to come.<br /><br />A most entertaining film for the entire family and especially for Batman fans.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great Bible app. Has many translations to choose from. Also has an audio feature that reads the Bible aloud to you. Great resource and a must for any Christian.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|So far, the Zoom is working as advertised, even with less than ideal positioning: It is both too low and too close to the player. We wanted to quickly test it out, so I hastily positioned our Zoom-equipped Kinect on our TV stand, which has a 1' 9\\" height--less than the 2-foot minimum recommended in the manual. Given the negative reviews, I didn't expect very good results. To my surprise, my 6-yr-old was able to play Disneyland Adventures a mere 3-4 feet away from the TV with no problems.  I read about the quality control issues, so lens clarity and distortion were the first things I looked for upon unboxing. As far as I can tell, I have a unit that is manufactured to spec. The snapshots taken in-game have the expected barrel distortion and hardly any vignetting, but none of the darkness issues that other reviewers are having problems with.  I don't know what else to say--it's working exactly as it's supposed to and saving me the hassle of moving our couch every time my daughter wants to play Kinect.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I grabbed this after playing the Puss 'N Boots version when it was the FAOTD and have both versions on my Kindle Fire.  I've passed on this game for ages because randomly hacking flying fruit just didn't appeal to me after trying it on IOS. The small screen made it frustrating and I honestly didn't get the appeal or popularity.<br /><br />Who knew!? This game is actually challenging and fun. It's the perfect time waster... too much of a great time waster! I hate to admit to the many hours I can sit and mindlessly  slice fruit.<br /><br />I love the sound effects- I think those squishy, splatter sounds are what hooked me.<br /><br />The game runs great on the Fire. I ignore &quot;feint&quot; on all games. I don't care about achievements or blades... yes, the game is repetitious and monotonous, but strangely addictive nonetheless.<br /><br />It makes sense now why this is a classic Android must-have in your game collection next to Angry Birds and Cut The Rope.<br /><br />*slice* *squish* *splat* *repeat*
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i think this app is so totally awesome and works great on my kindle fire. there are 60 levels, the last one is 6-0, the boss level on the roof, i think its cool how u can choose the quick play levels after adventure mode is passed. :) anyone know how 2 discover the Yeti zombie????????
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can work on computers as im out in the garage Or while sitting with my daughter watching tv  The controls are easy to use works very smooth over my wireless.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Good games especially for free, but they don't tell you what you're supposed to do, so there's room for improvement.
B001AQO3QA|2.0|Being Amazon customer since 2001, I have ordered US version of the Anthology but received discounted import product. I agreed to spend twice as much to get US release which comes with nice booklet type disk case similar to Star Wars edition. The import version comes with standard plastic box which for some users is more practical. And both disk versions are great but if I wanted to get import version why would I order US release for twice the price? I will think twice in the future when ordering product offered in more than one version to avoid similar issue. And merchant who shipped the item should pay more attention to what actually gets delivered.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's. awesome. but kind of hard to git points but I. only. put this review on here so ican git points
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This application works great on my Le Pan TC 970 (Android 2.2).  I have an XP machine at work which I am able to access by using the Google login option.  Previously, I could not get past the company firewall, but somehow Splashtop is working, perhaps by initiating an outbound connection.  Too bad they don't have a Linux server, but I am running Cygwin on the XP box, so all is not lost.  I am able to ssh to other Linux boxes on the company LAN.
B004GYY714|5.0|it is so easy to use its fun and the radio plays even when your playing games and browsing the web it is awesome i am 14 and i love it i use i every day :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|great playing and the tips are good to assist beginners find their errors we really like to play. this solitaire
B005KMX866|4.0|Short and sweet - a terrific record.  Chris Issak manages to pay homage to the music he loves but also makes it his own.  He's done Johnny, Carl, Elvis, Jerry, Roy, et al proud! The 2 disc \\"Deluxe\\" version is definitely worth the extra few $$$.  A must own if you're a Chris Issak fan.
B005HSL626|1.0|I downloaded this app tried to open it 3 times but it wouldn't go past an advertisement screen for I guess the parent company. maybe if I said yes please instead of no thank you to browsing purchasing something unrelated It would have opened the game.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This has got to be the best DC Comics film ever made!  It was great to see this film made so closely to the story of this classic 80's graphic novel.<br /><br />This movie is LONG, but, it really does hold your attention.  I feel the whole cast played these characters very well.  The costumes were more or less in the tradition of the comic ones.  Rorshack is my fav character from Watchmen.  Dr. Manhatten--Wish he would but some pants on!<br /><br />This film was truly made for the comic geeks.  My other fav comic films, where I feel they kept much of the style and storylines close to the comics are Hellboy, Punisher: Warzone, Sin City and Johan Hex.<br /><br />If you have over 2 1/2 hours to watch a great film, chose Watchmen! (In my opinion, this DC film even blows away Return of Superman, Green Lantern the Batman: The Dark Knight flicks--for those are too long and over the top--WATCHMEN was just right!)
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is up to the task of carrying anything and everything a prosumer photog needs to take with them.  It's build quality seems to be pretty good too.  Haven't put it through alot of abuse yet, but it seems to be well made.  For the price, this is definitely worth every penny.
B003YOZNBU|4.0|Never been a fan of western comics, but I have been aware of Jonah Hex.  I did like the episodes of Justice League Unlimited that featured Jonah Hex, so I figured I'd give this flick a shot (considering I feel many of the \\"non-blockbuster\\" comic films like Watchmen, Punisher: War Zone & Ghost Rider tend to be my fav comic book films).<br /><br />I thought this film was really good.  I liked how Jonah's origin was quick and to the point and presented it partially in animation form.<br /><br />The thought the acting was really good by the main character and villian.  Meagan Fox, well, it certainly wasn't a 5-star performance.<br /><br />The movie flowed well for clocking in at about 85 minutes.  The rockin' score was a cool touch vs. using county hee-haw music.<br /><br />Jonah Hex is not a well known DC character, yet I think this film did the character justice.  I wouldn't even mind a sequel!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Awesome app! By far the easiest remote tap I have ever had. Works like a charm On my droid X
B004O3YGMC|4.0|It's cool and does what it says. Now I need to find out if you can set this thing to turn on my Net book remotely. Otherwise, it's fairly useless. I'm not gonna leave my Net Book on all day.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Ive been using it for a few days now and it is pretty decent, IF, you check your phone frequently. I cant seem to make the app reminder set itself. No matter what I select in the reminder tones menu every time I hit 'OK' it closes the menu and doesn't select the ring tone. The vibrate setting will not work either. It does sync well and I have had no other issues. It would be a great deal more to my liking if the reminders would work. The task does pop up on the screen at the preset time, hence the need to check your phone frequently.
0316069884|5.0|A must read if you care at all about your health, the world - and most importantly, animal cruelty. An easy read that both my husband and I enjoyed - now newly vegans, we are so glad that we read this book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app has a great variety of games that are fun to play. It is a fun thing to do when you have down time or are procrastinating.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I purchased this book because it was on promotion on Amazon.  I read it in two days (OK, it is short).  This story keeps you connected because of the possibility.  Considering this book is dated, it was 'avantgardiste'.<br /><br />This is not a horror story by today's standards.  The background is horrific, but the impact is psychological.  As with many stories, 'I am Legend' asks \\"what if?\\"  With context, you must question what (or who) is good or evil....particularly....why!  Society's rules were defined because of a context.<br /><br />For those who saw the movie:  yes, the same background, but a completely different story.  Forget the movie, start the book when you have time to read it in one shot.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is an ok game but some are stupid but most are fun ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well, if u must know.this game filled with even more games is not only fun but addicting as well. download it now!  lol
B004O3YGMC|4.0|There is a considerable lag to the device with the higher screen resolution, proabbly my tablet. My inputs reached the computer nice and fast.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I gave this to my daughter, she is a huge fan of Adele, I knew she will enjoy it and she does. I was in the kitchen with my wife and we hear her voice, Adele's voice and it is angelical. 100% recommended.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I love classic rpgs, and SoE is no exception.  The story is pretty textbook for an rpg, but it is still compelling.  My one complaint is that the translation is lowzy.  The controls are great.  every part of the rpg mechanic is well made for a touch screen.  this is a must play rpg.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|works well on fire. challenging but not so difficult that u loose interest. its free which is always a plus.
B0063IH60K|4.0|it runs fine and ads are not too bad. I have to type more words to meet the minimum. twenty

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game can keep you busy for hours and your kids would like it and maybe even some parents a lot!!!!

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the best notepad app. It syncs directly with my computer so I have access to my data anytime I need it. I can use it to write notes in meetings or make grocery lists.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is to my opinion the game is some times really hard and cant get it but it is s good game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. very fun, and addicting. Definately a boredom buster as well. This app is for everyone who is looking for a fun easy and different way to kill time!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I really wasn't expecting much but this app really surprised me. It works well, was painless to set up and I was able to accomplish all the tasks I wanted to. the only thing it wouldn't do is play skyrim :( four stars for great performance and ease of use. would give 5 if it had more security features and possibly blacked out the host machines screen.

0385535139|4.0|Delivery of this [[ASIN:0385535139 The Litigators]] from Amazon.com was on time and as expected.  I enjoy reading John Grisham's books; but this time it took me a while to get into the story.  The ending was what I hoped for, but it seemed to take a long time to get there.  To me, this book was not as exciting as many of the other Grisham stories, but still a good read.  Mr. Grisham has a true understanding of the real legal world and how it differs from law school.  And that is what makes his books so appealing to me.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Date of review: 1/6/2012  It's probably one of the best games out for android devices that doesn't come with ads. You can get at least a 5-10 hours of gameplay that can be done over to unlock achievements and the secret zombie. No ads  Pros: Catch this app when its the free app of the day and you don't have to pay for it! But if you like it, donate to support the developers! I got it with Amazon's app promotional 3 dollar credit in September 2011. It's a classic.  Cons: Compared the iphone version+PC version, there's a lot less minigames. My friend has the same game for his iphone and I believe there's a rough estimate of 7-10 more minigames in comparasion to the android version. If you're not a fan of third party marketplaces, you're out of luck. You have to install android marketplace to download the app and you MUST keep it or PVZ will stop working  I know the cons list is longer, but that's only to explain what problems it has! It's one of my favorite android apps!
0525423656|5.0|I loved this book! It was a great sequel to Matched, and I can't wait for the next one! It did, however, get kind of long in certain parts.....but no worries! It was still great!

B000ZN802W|5.0|This is a definate watch. It is worth the while. It is a remarkable and touching film. I am always fascinated by people like Christopher McCandless. I appreciate the boldness he posses. He has a no fear approach to live life just the way he wants. This is my kind of movie.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|HBO's Rome two seasons (originally shown in the years 2005-2007) covers in twenty two episodes the twenty two year period between the battle of Alesia in 52 BC and the aftermath to the battle of Actium in 30 BC (Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC is shown at the end of the first season and the beginning of the second season). While several plot threads runs through the series, basically the first season is about how Caesar rose to hold absolute power (defeating rivals like Pompey) just before being murdered, while the second season tell us how after Caesar's death, a struggle began between Octavian (later emperor Augustus) and Mark Antony to fill the existent power void generated.  The series is centered round the lives of two friends and comrades from the campaign in Gaul, the hot tempered Vorenus (played by Kevin McKidd, who looks a lot like Daniel Craig) and the more amiable Pullo (played by Ray Stevenson, who looks a bit like Mel Gibson and another bit like Russell Crowe) They both existed historically (two centurions bearing those names are mentioned in Caesar's Commentaries on the War in Gaul), but little else is known about them, so most of what is shown in the TV series is invented. The rest of the cast is mostly British, none of them very famous (most of them come from a BBC high drama/theatrical background) but they mostly acquit themselves fine: James Purefoy particularly excels as the slimy, edgy Mark Antony; David Bamber is a fine Cicero, so is Polly Walker as the scheming matron Attia. Tobias Menzies is also good as the well intentioned but politically naïve Brutus, the gorgeous Kerry Condon impresses as the young, promiscuous Octavia, while Ciaran Hinds is good in his understated, dignified performance as Julius Caesar.  With the obvious exception of having the Romans speak in English (there is always something ridiculous about movies where Romans deliver obscenities in a Cockney accent) real care was taken by the filmmakers to make this series as historically accurate as possible.  The production values are considerable. Still, since they didn't have an enormous budget, the filmmakers decided not to film huge crowd scenes, concentrating instead on smaller, more intimate scenes. Thus Mark Antony's funeral oration of Caesar is referred to but not shown, and with the exception of the battle of Philippi none of the other battles of the era is recreated. Despite this smaller scope, this miniseries represents a considerable achievement, a triumph both of popular and intelligent entertainment and scholarship.  As a nice extra, the DVD features some very good information about different aspects of Ancient Rome to help us understand the series and the era more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome perfect for killing time! I use it on the train to school makes the 40 minute commute not seem so bad.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|has a lot of games some hard some like wow way to easy wish there were more hard games on here
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works very well on the phone also. Very easy set up. This is one of those apps I didn't know I needed, and would highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun. I like it a lot. some.games are easy some frustrating. but worth the price tag.of nothing. Yay fun games.
B002962RKE|5.0|I had heard of Glee before, both good and bad reviews, but had never watched an episode. However, now that I have a Kindle Fire and am ADDICTED to it, I decided that there was nothing to lose with trying it out. I'm not to big on trying out new shows if its not from the very beginning, so when I seen that I could start at season one and watch the episodes free with my amazon prime account I gave it a try. And being able to watch it from my laptop as well is a big plus. My boyfriend can use the Fire while I wastch from the laptop with no additional price. ANYWAY, on to the show. I enjoyed it. I found myself laughing out loud even.And its funny to me because I have teased so many people for watching this show that I assumed was so lame, LOL. Im starting to wonder if the people that had negative things to say about the show had ever even watched it or if they just made assumptions like I did. I know Glee has a huge fan base and I can see why.<br /><br />YES, the quality was a bit choppy at parts, but it only happened a few times and after rewinding it a few seconds I was able to get it right back on track. I have a feeling I am really going to get into this show. I loved all the talent and can't wait to see more performances. I think it all depends on your humor personality as to whether or not you will enjoy this show. If your wondering what kind of humor I have (as someone who enjoyed it) I am a bit corny at times, which I can see the show is as well. Some of my favorite comedies are Big Daddy, The Hangover 1 & 2, The Sitter, Due Date, I love Chelsea Lately, etc, etc. So if you like those shows, you might just like this. And to see all the amazing talent is nice too! I know im a few years late, but I hope that this will be a show that will continue to surprise me!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is really fun and enjoyable to play. Haven't found an app that has as wide of range of variety in games to play as this one.
B002OLG0X4|5.0|I really, really like this show. Where was I in 2009? This show has talent, humor and a catchY storyline. I can tell I am going to zip through this season. I hope I still make time for my DVR!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|definitely worth the purchase. you have to unlock the games and that makes for a challenge. also a good game to pass the time.
B0052U59F4|4.0|Loved this book and it's sequel!!!  OMG...hot hot hot hot hot.  I understand this comes from a twilight fan-fic?  I see similarities in the characters, but THIS story is NOT YA.  OMG...did I mention HOT?!  Not into DOM/SUB kink, but man---if I had someone like Christian Grey, I'm sure I'd consider it! I loved the characters, was awake until 5 am reading it(had to work the next day!).  This is not my typical genre, I'm not a romance girl---I just love a good story.  This story was FAN-EFFING-TASTIC!  It also reminded me of \\"Pretty Woman\\"...maybe it's the piano scene in the sequel---who knows!  It was paced well, and I was never skimming through chapters out of boredom.    My only criticism is this:  I understand that the writer is British, but she should've had some American editors, because the characters in this book conversed as if they were in London, not Seattle---I lived in England and now ironically live in near Seattle (American Military)---apart from the weather, the two are NOT similar.  I got over the dialect soon enough and drank up the story!!  That was the ONLY reason this book got 4 stars.  Criticism aside, buy the book.  Team Edward-Schmedward.  I'm Team Grey!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun but can be confusing.  its worth downloading though - good for any minute of down time. wont need to download many games for a long time
