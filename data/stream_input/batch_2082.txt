141659521X|3.0|\\"The Last man\\" is my second Vince Flynn book. Joe Rickman, one of the CIA's top agent posted in Afghanistan is missing. CIA is worried that if Rickman falls into wrong hands then CIA's clandestine informations may land up in wrong hands and endanger several lives. CIA director Kennedy sends Rapp to find Rickman. Rapp finds during the course of investigation that some powerful force is trying to handicap the CIA agency. Plot also has a tussle between FBI and CIA. Books also gives internal working details of ISI, Pakistan intelligence agency, and ISI's relationship with CIA. I found this very informative and intriguing.<br /><br />I did not find book \\"The Last man\\" as interesting as the book \\"Transfer of power\\". \\"The Last man\\" plot is predictable and I was not hooked to the book.<br /><br />Overall the book is a good read and I recommend it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I'm sad to say that I'm a late arival to The Godfather films. Thankfully a friend brought me around one weekend with a marathon. When I got home I know I had to add this to my collection.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|A lot of things from this book was disturbing, but I was really interested in it and enjoyed it. The end of the book kind of bored me because she talks about how she doesn't like to bring her kids in public with her a lot and went on about that for too long. But the actual story was good.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|A friend's now fiance got him hooked on Dr. Who so I sent him the 10h doctor's screwdriver and as a surprise I sent her River's Screwdriver. so they could both run around the house having adventures.<br /><br />His Thankyou:the 10th Doctor's Sonic Screwdriver! WOO!<br /><br />And then the icing on the cake, the added gift (River's Sonic Screwdriver)for my soon-to-be wife. She was ecstatic and said this was the best Secret Santa ever (since she got a gift from it and hadn't expected one.)
0307592731|5.0|My wife and I couldn't stop reading about the pain that is either in us, or constantly knocking on our door to get in.<br />A caveat: There was no need for the eroticism detailed in Ms. Strayed sexual escapades. It took away from her need to fill the hole in her heart through these escapades. Still a very good book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't often write reviews, and usually when I do, it's because I feel the existing Amazon reviews are misleading and inaccurate.  I chose to read WOOL (Omnibus Kindle Edition) because out of over 100 books in my \\"to read\\" queue, it was the highest rated after thousands of reviews.  Which, to me, meant one of two things: either this is truly something special, or I should fire off another Amazon review to explain why my expectations were set way too high, and state why everyone is wrong.<br /><br />Let me say: everyone is NOT wrong.<br /><br />The five shorter works that make up the Omnibus edition are each unique.  Some are written in a more descriptive, introspective and minimalistic style.  Others are faster, action-based, page-turners.  But they also each comprise different events at different times, and therefore the change in style is so fitting.  The fact that each story (despite the similar setting) has a completely different feel, adds to the documentary nature of these stories in the history of this strange place.  I don't know how someone writes like this.  It takes a talent that I don't quite comprehend.<br /><br />The most crowning achievement of the book is that Howey creates a world where you never know what to expect, but with each unexpected event, the layers of the onion peel back so that you understand this world a little better.  And at the same time, there are new mysteries at each new layer.  Even if you never quite understand the rules of this place, you are never left feeling like the author is making it up as it goes along. I feel like I could talk about this for pages and pages: the importance in science fiction of creating a clearly defined, controlled world where the reader still feels like they can be surprised by what happens, but where characters don't change or break the rules of this world when the plot requires it.<br /><br />I would recommend this book VERY highly to fans of science fiction and dystopian fiction.<br /><br />Now, have I set your expectations too high?  Read it and see for yourself. But I don't think I have.
B00866H7SS|3.0|I felt like it was too much like Fifty Shades.<br />It did hold my attention bu not like Fifty Shades did.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I loved this documentary, and I recommend it to any thoughtful person interested in music, the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa, and/or just  the  human spirit. The story is remarkable, unforgettable, inspiring - so thought-provoking that we talked about it for a long time after we saw it, which is saying something.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|After reading the first book , I guess I expected more out of the second book<br />Will not buy the third one
B003U0AHBO|5.0|I have always been a fan of the Robin Hood Story and enjoyed this make of the story. It was different story line than what has been presented in the past but I found it enjoyable none the less.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I started into these books I had no idea where it was going or if I could even handle some of the passages. I hung in there and found myself enamoured and captivated. This is not what I expected and I am so glad I read all three, and I have to say I found myself want more even after the last one.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|I am a Flash Gordon fan from the movie serials as a kid (way back when) so jumped at this blue ray which was very reasonable in the price range. If you're a sci-fi fan from the &#34;back when&#34; we only had the serial and comic books to read you will enjoy this movie. Liked the colors and audio blue ray made the movie pop! for me.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|A typical John Grisham novel, easy to read, keeps you involved in the story with a few twists and turns along the way.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Mumford & Sons has done it with this album. They have a unique style that seems to have grabbed quite a large audience. This record is a great example of that.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|McKenna does a great job of painting a the scenes with her descriptions and setting the exact tones with her renditions of the various brogues and local accents employed by her characters. This book could easily translate to film. The story evoked my empathy for the pain endured by the main players and then had me laughing aloud at visual images of the comic circumstances the single populace find themselves in when seeking a soul mate.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford & Sons has done it with this album. They have a unique style that seems to have grabbed quite a large audience. This record is a great example of that.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I am a huge fan of fantasy novels. My favorite author is Terry Brooks and I believe him to be the king of what he does. However after reading the Mistborn series I am a big time fan now of Sanderson. This book pulls you in with it's vivid characters and fantastic plot. It is well written and flows with ease in this original story.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|Ray's voice really comes through on this album and there are no bad songs. I have been wanting this album for a while.
B002UHSDUK|5.0|Dave was awesome, always has been. Glad they made greatest hits..had this album but somehow lost it..thanks digital download! Love it!
B0014EVO4M|5.0|I have been a big fan of Eddie Vedder from the first time I heard Pearl Jam till present day. It seems that as he has grown and adjusted his musical direction, I have followed with my musical interest.
B007JOM0GC|4.0|good beat. good lyrics. good songs. some not appropriate for kiddos. Katy improved her songwriting skills. easy to relate to.
B00138KKP8|5.0|From the time I first heard the song Trouble on a tv commercial I had tracked down the artist and have been following his music. This is a great album.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its a cool game, a little tricky to maneuver around for a while but once you get used to it. Love the leprechaun part :)
B00177YA1K|5.0|It was a gift and she loved it.  A last minute gift.  I've always enjoyed these two actors and will continue to watch all of their movies.
B003V4AK8E|3.0|The controller fits great in your hands because it's bigger than the normal controllers. Only problem is it has a lot of dead space on the joysticks and some games the buttons are pretty laggy, but for the price it's still pretty good.
B0091LS07E|3.0|I continue to expect the same great albums as her first couple, but have been disappointed.  I will not purchase the next one so quickly.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game.It's very addicting if that helps! You collect coins and unlock people and get chased bye a police! It's awesome. I'm glad I got this free product!
B0049IHX2C|5.0|It was a gift and she loves the series, as do I.  I hope the series continues and produces more movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is a not good game A GREAT GAME. I like it because I<br /> like challenges and its kind of a challenge when u have been on the game for a while it starts going really fast.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This was by far the best animated movie that I have seen in a long time. My 6 year old son absolutely loved it. But my husband (not a big cartoon man) loved it too. Adam Sandler is great I suggest everybody with and without kids see this movie.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Thought it was to long.<br />Could of had more indepth stories. Didnt really understand alot of it, couldn't get into it.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I love the idea of this book! Written from the point of view of the doggie Enzo. Such a clever idea! This book was a fun, easy read. I laughed often throughout the book and I also cried at the end. I loved the characters and the story. I recommend it!
6305428042|5.0|This movie is one of the best Halloween movies in recent years.  I had a well-used VHS copy that I bought new when it was first released.  It finally degraded to the point where I had to make the choice to abandon or replace.  I did not hesitate to spring for a DVD version.  All the witches are hilarious and very well portrayed.  The story line is rich and well thought-through.  The sets and costumes are perfect and the other production values are very high.  I still watch this several times a year and enjoy it every time.
B005GIS1WA|3.0|The movie was pretty good, but the streaming issues caused the kids to lose focus. It eventually resolved, but we lost the energy for the film.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|When I saw the first series I was absolutely hooked.  My reaction from the start was that someone finally got Medievel right - just as the recent Lord of the Rings movies finally got Tolkein right - finally - heavy sigh.  My next step was to get the Kindle version of all five books and was able to finish the second book before the second series appeared on HBO.  While I understand that some creative license must be allowed to move the story along within the allotted time limits, I was a little disappointed that there were some actions given to other characters to perform and that some time-lines were misplaced as well. This world and all its characters is very tightly interwoven, especially with the Stark family flung to the four corners of that world amid war and chaos.  Some sacrifice to minute detail must be tolerated.  This being said though, I'm going to be disappointed and disillusioned if the third and subsequent seasons stray any further from the books than was seen in the second season.  I am almost finished with the fifth book and am anxiously awaiting the sixth, which is advertised to be released sometime in 2013.  George R R Martin has created a wonderful world, rich and accurate in detail with fascinating characters and story lines.  The movie series need to be given the chance to live up to the books.
1575666286|5.0|Charlotte's love for her father's work to continue comes out clearly along her dedication to help people. Would love to thank her in person.  It seems hard to do and a little extreme, but is it a little extreme to lay open your chest?  You decide.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I have enjoyed this anthology very, very much.  My fav, of course, is his funky treatment of &#34;American Woman.&#34;  I'm glad I bought the entire CD instead of just downloading that one song.  There's other really great songs I wasn't that familiar with but am getting to love.  I highly recommend this if you're not familiar with his entire body of work.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I found this a very long but interesting book. Not finished yet but still enjoying it. It spends a lot of time on the wars that I was not too interested in.
160059672X|5.0|Sherry combines excellent basic instructions, which are easy to follow, with wonderfully inspiring designs.  Not only will you be able to make what she teaches, but also will want to begin your own creative journey.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show keeps us on the edge of our seats the whole time! It's like we're watching a movie. Awesome show... Enough said.
B001AXKXEY|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. If you like music, you will like this. The Glass Prison is one of DTs best and the whole SDOIT composition that makes up the second part of the album is great too. Hell, the whole thing is great!
0061438294|5.0|\\"Establish a baseline, observe deviations, probe to confirm...\\"<br /><br />There is no one single tell, let alone a universal one. However, if you establish a good baseline of how the person behaves and reacts in different situations (happiness, guilt, fear, etc.), then the deviations can serve as powerful hints to help discover how that person really feels at any point in time. And this is exactly what this book provides: a detailed overview of the many ways our body reacts to different stimuli and situations. You'll start with legs (yes, legs), move on to torso, arms, neck, and face - there are hundreds of small micro-reactions and expressions that can give someone away. The trick is in knowing in what to look for!<br /><br />How useful is this for someone who's not tracking down criminals? Your mileage will vary. At the very least, its an interesting and an educational read. But this information can also be useful in situations like an interview (no matter which side of the table you're on), or any meeting for that matter, and around your friends and family. If nothing else, it can help make you more attentive to those around you.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed this puzzle adventure very much. I started with the free lite app but couldn't stop. I had to open the full game. I hope there will be a follow up or further adventure. Thank you.
1455527475|5.0|If nothing else, this book is a great window into the corporate culture of Goldman Sachs and how it has evolved over the past decade - and the entire premise, or rather the argument, is that it has changed a lot, and not for the better. The author does a good job of introducing the reader to Wall Street culture, language, and characters. It is an accessible book for everyone and an educational read, especially if you are interested in learning about a new industry, or have an interest in cultural and corporate anthropology.<br /><br />Perhaps more importantly is what this book is not: analysis of the financial crises, prescription how to \\"fix\\" the system, another rant about Wall Street. The author leaves it to you to draw your own conclusions on any of the above. Instead, this is a great first-hand account of what it was like to work at Goldman from 2000 to 2010, and how the industry and the company has evolved in that period.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book can be enjoyed on two different levels. First of all, it is one of those stories where you can't wait to see how the end of the story unfolds yet you don't want it to end because you feel you know the characters. The author's technique of moving between the past and the present works well here. I found myself cheering for the main character, hoping she would finally learn to trust others and herself, while fulling understanding why she probably won't. I found myself reading this book late into the night.<br /><br />Secondly, I loved the descriptions of all the flowers and the meanings behind each. I will definitely use the appendix at the back of the book the next time I order flowers for someone I love.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the reviews of the book for some time before I started to read it.  I felt that the book was a little slow at first but then wham!  It is a long read but I really enjoyed it as did almost all the reviewers.  This story is different from any scifi novel that I have read.  A very different twist.  Spent a lot of late nights reading.  Really enjoyed it and highly recommend it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I know why everyone is watching and loves Downton Abbey!  The characters are awesome!<br />I watched seasons 1 & 2 in one week so I could start with Season 3  this season.  Highly recommended!
0765325950|5.0|I am so glad that I bought this, thoroughly enjoyed the read.  Sadness & happiness combine for an epic ending.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I joy reading Clancy's books . They are very detailed and informative , but sometimes to technical .  Also have a good story line...
B000Q9IR0A|4.0|It is nice to know how to follow through the excution. Usually thinking the sterategy is more inportant than excuting it, but this book shows us the most important things for business is the follow through.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Excellant Movie....very, very funny.  Great music.  Highly recommend to all age groups.  The music was very well written and performed.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I am a bif fan of Howard Shore music since 'The Lord of the Rings'. I would not expect less from him in this track to 'The Hobbit'. Of course i was not disappointed. Shore's score is now a mature view of the fantastic fantasy world of Tolkien. However it resembles LOTR many times, other times it has a personality of its own. Well, to the fans of classic/instrumental music, or even film music, this is a must have.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I have to say I wish I had written this show.  The perfect script for our time and a twist at every corner,
B000V86OKG|5.0|Great Actor this guy does playing the Dexter character on tv.  But Showtime does like to push the limits of tv shows with all their shows.  Like with the first season give you reviewers a summery of what happened in this season.  The basic is Dexter's secret is found out by some people finding his dumped bodies at bottom of the Bay Harbor, then the press name the killer \\"The Bay Harbor Butcher.\\"  Doakes thinks he knows Dexter's secret and starts following him to learn his secret and thinks it has to do with drugs, He feels the noose tightening around his neck as the season progresses onward.  Dexter doesn't know who to trust and starts to loose Rita and the kids as the special FBI force closes in on the Bay Harbor Butcher but is he a innocent man or actually the killer trying not to be caught.  Dexter still having flashbacks of his Foster Father and the lessons he showed him therw the years together, but what Doakes tells Dexter about his foster Father Dexter learns the truth of the monster his father created and ended him sending him over the edge.  But as everything starts to unfold Dexter starts to see the big picture and wants to get rid of the woman he can't trust at all no matter what she says to anyone her name being Lila...but if you want to know what Dexter does at the end of the season buy this show and enjoy it as much as I do I actually ended up watching 7 EP's in a row to finish this season so I can start season 3 soon enough then move onto the rest of the seasons little by little.  But what was so cool about the season Finale was the fact they had a scene in the Finale just like the opening credits showing Dexter shaving and cooking food so forth which amaze me and enjoy the show so much more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not usually a horror show watching gal, but this series is so unpredictable, gripping and well written that I am completely hooked!
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Really draws you in. Has you rooting for the bad guys! Great movie, really enjoyed and made a great gift.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|I will keep it short and sweet.  KEANE is my favorite band today.  I've traveled to four different US cities to see them so far, and each time they've sounded better than the last.  I, like most fans, got a little worried after the release of the Night Train album, but they could not have impressed me more with Strangeland!  What a sweet mix of faster and slower songs, beautifully written and played, and this album is simply a FANTASTIC work by a trio (well, there's four of them now) of FANTASTIC musicians!  Keane is in top form again here, and their Strangeland tour that just wrapped up was the best concert that I've ever been to.  No one is better at playing \\"pretty music\\" than KEANE, and this album scores a perfect \\"10\\" as far as I'm concerned!
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Did not get my attention and was poorly written. The character descriptions are so bland that they just don't draw you into the story. Put it down after a couple of chapters.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Works great. Great fun. Great graphics. Can't beat the price since it was free. Highly recommend to anyone who enjoys angry birds.
0439023491|5.0|I really liked this book. It definitely kept me wanting to read it as much as possible. I got so involved in the characters and was so mad when Katniss and Peeta had to go back to The Hunger Games, but I can't wait to read the final book and see how it all ends.....and what happened to Peeta!
B008D28HYS|5.0|This is a great game.  I got it for free on the FAOTD but would suggest it to anyone.  If you know the nanogram puzzles this is a great one.  Many levels (some WAY too hard for me), plus above all they actually update all of the time adding new levels.<br /><br />One thing to know though on the larger levels playing this on a cell phone can make it difficult to see what is happening.<br /><br />I liked the color better than their standard CrossMe, just adds more depth to the game.<br /><br />DroidX
B005ZD8I6K|1.0|The quality of this movie was atrocious! I don't know how Amazon thinks they can get away with this. This so-called HD version That cost an extra two dollars Is a pathetic excuse. I rented this to watch with my daughter. The movie was so blurry and distorted I didn't know what we were even watching.  Shame on you Amazon never again And of course there's nowhere to state your opinion to Amazon. What a joke
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I like this game, it is a good version of the Nanogram puzzle.<br /><br />I do enjoy their color version better....<br /><br />DroidX
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I really don't watch much television...but I sat down with my grand kids and loved this movie more than they did :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever totally so worth seven bucks buy this buy this buy it buy it awesome game buy it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow, AMAZING!!!!!  Can't wait for the movie!!<br />She has incredible courage! I would like to believe I could be as brave if needed.
034580404X|3.0|This is a really ridiculous story, but I had to read it so I could understand what everyone has been talking about.  I get the love story aspect, but really, no one, not even young people, have as much sex as these two do.  I read them all in about 5 days while commuting to work.
B0092W2GSG|5.0|Once again, Calexico delivers one great song after another, and you can get this album for a great price! Don't miss it!
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Anyone who likes music and  doesn't mind documentary films should see this. Rodriguez isn't a well recognized artist in the United States, but he should be.
B004YEJGEO|5.0|I started playing this game and then told my husband about it so he could join in on the madness. Now I have to try to drag him away. It's addictive and employs sometimes thinking about things in ways you weren't expecting.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Saw the movie now I am reading the books, all 14 of them. Very comparable to Vince Flynn books and story line.
0316077054|5.0|My daughter has loved this series since it first came out (we bought the first book as soon as it came out because Amazon had it listed as one of the best of December, 2009). We ended up meeting the authors a few months later and then again during their tour for the movie. The books are enchanting and Katy and I loved them so much I made her a Lena necklace.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast, scary if this what real life is like for out clandestine services. Can't wait for the next one to be published.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I love this game. It's got the same habit as the sequel of rebooting themselves randomly. It thankfully takes you back to where you were (with about three seconds back from where you'd actually been) so I did end up getting to redo something without the hint.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all of the Fifty Shades books. It is a fairy tale ending and it just makes you want more. It makes you want a better sex life, a man that worships you like Christian worships and loves Ana, and it makes you cry.  I just absolutely loved it!!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I'm unsure what I'm rating here... I buy all of my tunes from Amazon, the prices are usually fair, there's no DRM telling me what I can and cannot play it on or how many times I can listen to it before it disappears (iTunes and Wally World, for instance). I've also noticed that I can buy explicit (uncensored) music at Amazon, I absolutely HATE listening to a tune where they've chopped and butchered it to make it &#34;clean&#34;!!! Not much &#34;storage&#34; space for things purchased in the past, so I store it on Google...
B005H0IW6W|5.0|He has a wonderful voice and this xmas cd is a good one to have to listen to over the holidays
B007LB2B3K|5.0|I would use another word instead, but Amazon would likely block it... but you know what I mean! This is one of those bands that I hear once and immediately like. The lead singer has an interesting voice and the music is somewhat unique (hard to do nowadays). Crank it up!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is amazing! The app has much better quality and graphics than the first Temple Run! To everyone who has not gotten this app yet, get it while it's FREE!! :)
B003VDZK8K|5.0|What can I say about Avenged Sevenfold? I saw them at the Uproar Festival in Kansas City in 2011... lots of fire, special effects, and a giant demon head with fire blasting out of it too. At the time, I wasn't overly amused, it was hot when I got there and the temperature had dropped to about 40° and I was in shorts and a t-shirt! Just bad timing... the music grew on me after I bought the album. Good stuff (substitute real word)!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was alright.  In the appendix, Grisham didn't have anyone to acknowledge because none of the book was based on fact.  He even called himself a lazy author.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a remarkable story about a truly remarkable man. The. Title \\"Fearless\\" describes a breed of  people with unwavering dedication: Adam Brown a fearless American family man, a SEAL.
B000ICZCZS|5.0|This is one of my favorite all-time movies. Hugh Grant is at his best in this story &#34;about a boy&#34; as well as the whole movie being perfectly cast. Highly recommend this to anyone of any age.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|OF MY GOSH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This series is probably my FAVORITE.<br />Homeland keeps you guessing about what the heck is going to happen next.<br />This is a home video MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!
B00170I7GG|5.0|A Bill Murray classic with a lesson good for everyone.  I could watch this over and over...and who doesn't like a good polka.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I recommend this book as the entire idea of Panem society is a reflect of the actions our own society.
B003B02PFO|4.0|This is a pretty good book. Really enjoy John Grisham. One of my favorite authors. I have alot of his books, this is my first one on Kindle.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Actually stumbled on to this cd.  Being a big SD fan for years I thought I was up on<br />everything DF and WB have done.  But this one fell in my lap.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|This app allows me to keep up with what I follow because I never seem to have time to on my computer. I like the choice of screen view (grid or list) and am pleased with its speed and compatibility.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|This book has some wonderful insights into attitude and practice in leaving the world of &#34;more&#34; and becoming free from the insanity of a bulging closets & garages, and storage boxes under the bed.  But she also gets too intense and really...borrowing dishes from others because you don't want to store enough in your own cupboards to have a dinner party?  It does take some critical thinking to draw the line between good sense and the extreme.
6304806434|5.0|This no nonsense, non stop action film kept me constantly on the edge of my seat. Nicholas's one liners were great.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This a great app for horse lovers or farmers who want a horse here you go it's also  3-d.. you can enter competitions buy more and more horses!!!!
B003EYVXTG|4.0|The acting kept me on the edge of my seat. It was quite realistic. The directing was quite exceptional and I enjoyed it very much.
0545101417|5.0|This book arrived much more quickly then was imlied.  Product was new and not damaged in anyway.  I would suggest this group.
B001BANK32|5.0|No matter how hard I looked, I was unable to find this in paperback anywhere. The movie was amazing, but like with every other novel made into a movie, the book is way better. This is one of my all time favorites preceded only by the gunslinger series and dreamcatcher.

0393343405|3.0|The real title of this book should be \\"Stretch\\" or \\"Ha Ha Stretch.\\"  The thesis that a single poem changed history is nonsense.  The concepts espoused by Lucretius were common in his time, although heretical, as many of them are today!  Even the bibliography presented appears to be a put on that strongly resembles the sort of thing that I passed off in college in an attempt to demonstrate that my work was well researched.<br /><br />Let's suppose that Thomas Jefferson had copies of this poem.  Who's to say that they came from a single source?  Or who can say what influence any one work may have had on anyone, much less Jefferson?<br /><br />One day no doubt someone like Greenblatt will find a pair of toenail clippers near my bones and conclude that this one tool is what was used to persuade employees to toil in the industrial age.  Otherwise why would it be buried with an influential Amazon review writer?  Naturally that doesn't make sense, any more than Greenblatt's thesis in this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just bought Season 3 from Amazon as I do not have a TV and prefer anyway to pick what I watch. It's hard not to sit there and watch them all but I'm trying to space it out so it will last longer as I hate them to end.

B004LROUW2|5.0|This was my first experience with reading Haruki Murakami. Oh my he is something else and I think you either love his writing or not. I don't mind repeats and the story hooked me from the first page I couldn't stand to put it down. I had the book from a library sale and found it too heavy to hold up at night reading in bed so I bought it on Kindle, proble solved. I look forward to buying more of his writing on Kindle.

0525953728|5.0|This is a incredible book. America the beautiful. We are still the worlds only super power. Why?<br />Because we are strong bold and generous. That's right we give more then we take. As great as this book is we as a country are the reason<br />Men like this exist. We love courage bravery<br />And walk with a moral conviction. Read this book and see the men of America at work.<br />Loved it.
0765325950|4.0|Difficult to see the series come to an end. I wont spoil it for anyone reading, but there will be some dissapointments. I really think it should have been two more books. Seems like we skimmed over a lot of things.
B00B7G23KQ|2.0|The Paranormal Activity film series continues with this fourth entry. This time, the cell phones and computer cameras are focused on a teenage girl (Kathryn Newton) whose family allow a young boy in their neighborhood named Robbie (Brady Allen) to stay with them while his mom is sick. Soon after, eerie things start happening in the household, some of which focus on the girl's younger brother Wyatt. As the bumps in the night become more pronounced, the mysteries surrounding Robbie's family and the house across the street grow to the point where the only thing for the teen girl to do is investigate herself.<br /><br />I really enjoyed PA 1 and 2, 3 was okay and I was really disappointed with this one. It leaves more questions than answers and the ending happens so fast, you're wondering did that really happen?? As with the other movies, the beginning is slow and  the tension slowly, slowly builds. If there is a part 5, I hope it answers the questions brought by part 4. What was the connection with Wyatt? If Robbie was \\"Hunter\\"? Why were they after Wyatt? I think they are starting to run out of ideas and if that's case, maybe it's time to retire the PA series.<br /><br />Unless you are a diehard fan, wait for this one to come on cable, don't waste your money!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Great writing style kept me waiting for the next turn. Can't wait to read the other 3 an to see the movie this month
B008ODZUN2|2.0|Spoilers below:<br /><br />This film is beautifully shot and staged, and the acting is well done.  There, those are my only two positive comments.  Now, to my criticisms.<br /><br />As many others have mentioned, the shrieking, beyond melodramatic violin score through the initial scenes made me feel like I wanted to claw my skin off.  Someone needs to instruct director Terence Davies that a film score is supposed to draw the audience IN to the story line, not make them wish to run for the nearest exit.  We are introduced to the main character, Hester, as she is attempting suicide with every means at her disposal in her squalid post-war flat. In a mixture of flashbacks and real-time, we are shown the situations that supposedly brought her to this point.<br /><br />For the sake of (unrequited) love and passion, Hester has thrown over her rich older husband (a judge) for an oily, selfish ex-RAF officer. She and her lover are so immature and dim and self-destructive that I can feel nothing like sympathy for either one of them.  Hester apparently longs for the kind of ill-fated, all consuming love she read about as a girl in Wuthering Heights or Abelard & Heloise; but WWII comes along and so she takes safe refuge in a sterile marriage to a well-off old man. He loves her deeply, but she treats him like a favorite uncle. Not surprisingly, she's bored and miserable.<br /><br />We first meet Freddie, now back a few years from the war.  He admits in an early meeting in a pub with Hester that \\"nothing can compare to surviving the Battle of Britain,\\" so it's clear that his emotional intelligence is frozen at that high-adrenaline moment in time; what sexual relationship is ever going to measure up to that high water mark in a chap's life?  While Hester is totally besotted with Freddie, the most romantic thing we ever hear from him is, \\"I say, you really are the most attractive girl I've met.\\"  Finally, in a scene about 1/2 way through the film, we see that the reason Hester tried to off herself in the first scene is because Freddie callously spent the weekend in the country with friends and not only missed her birthday, but forgot it entirely. Missed birthday = dirt nap, at least in Hester's overwrought imagination.  Of course, by movie's end, her hysteria has worn out even Freddie's limited intelligence and he leaves her in the lurch (although, to his credit, he finally does show her some modicum of regret).<br /><br />Some reviewers have mentioned \\"how romantic\\" and \\"how tragic\\" this story was, and how it brought them to tears.  If this is really the depiction of a love story that you can relate to, then I fear for your future happiness.  In fact, the only time I personally teared up was when Hester witnesses the elderly landlady tending to her dying husband of many, many years and she lets Hester have it straight: \\"You don't have any idea what real love is. Real love is wiping someone's ass, or changing the sheets on the bed because he wets them; it's being there and letting them keep their dignity.\\"  For me, that was the high point of the film.

B006UIUJ2A|4.0|This is more than just a narrative. I read it at different levels - satire, occasionally bordering on the absurd, dramatic depiction of the horror of life in North Korea and an absorbing story of the various personae of the main character, Jun Do. The chronological variations, chapter by chapter, also made it different from standard novels.

0857685848|4.0|I love dinosaurs myself, and was already familiar with many of the artists in the book, so I liked this book a lot—but I bought it to give away as part of a white elephant gift exchange, and when it was unwrapped, an uproar of enthusiasm erupted from some folks there who are sort of more &#34;hardcore&#34; dinosaur geeks. Apparently they've all been wanting to buy this book for a long time. I thought that was a pretty good endorsement. My only wish is that the images were even bigger. Some of them are truly gorgeous. Frankly, I didn't read any of it before giving it away, but the pictures alone are reason enough to buy it!
B0056C6XIA|4.0|I am very satisfied with this tool. It can be used in many different operations. I will definitly recomand this item.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King continues to live up to his great literary reputation in &#34;11/22/63&#34;.<br /><br />The author adeptly and imaginatively handles the &#34;time travel&#34; concept with an engrossing, well crafted story.<br /><br />The characters are painted with a delicate, picturesque brush.  They are real persons with whom the reader may easily empathize.<br /><br />Mr. King is a skilled wordsmith, conjuring brilliant images of persons, real and imaginary, and the places which were the venues of this sad but important time in American history.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the work tends to be lengthy, but Mr. King's writing continually holds the attention of the reader, so the length of the work is only a minor issue.<br /><br />&#34;11-22-63&#34; is highly recommended reading.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Twilight is a awesome book. I could settle with a little less romance, but I love how there's a big fight at the end.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Michael Connelly can't write enough of these stories. The Concrete Blonde, like his others, is intelligent, psychologically sophisticated, gripping, and even educational. Harry Bosch is in some ways troubled and always complicated, but Connelly makes you feel like you really know the guy, and you like and admire and root for him even when he's acting badly. At bottom he is a very good guy, looking out for and caring about people, whether they are his friends or the strangers he has sworn to protect and serve. And, while he invariably gets bloodied in the process, he always gets the bad guy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When I got this game I wasn't expecting what I got, I was expecting a low quality, cheesy and cheaply made game, since I rarely ever read reviews. I love the idea and the graphics, plus the simplicity of it all. The only things that really bother me are that I can't figure out how to train my horse (but that's probably because I missed something.) And how to get gems.

B009UX2YAC|1.0|I think Subway Surfers could be better it but it is a pretty good game I like how it has a world tour. I would change that if you don't get the daily challenge before the time runs out you can't do it anymore because you can lose so people to Temple Run from that.

B00AFROVQC|2.0|The main character who is already in his teens is supposed to possess the potential to become the greatest ruler of all time, the best in thousands of years.  And yet he has no insight into human nature, makes rash and very foolish decisions, with no idea of what the likely consequences might be, and a very poor sense of priorites.  At one point in the story he has a few hours to prevent a monumental tragedy, and decides to leave town instead of preparing and making plans.  Then when he has minutes or seconds to spare, he goes to chat with various people, get in arguments etc...<br /><br />The king and his family also make very unrealistic choices and actions.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a cute freebie harlequin that ate up an evening in a pleasant way.<br /><br />The structure of the beginning of Waking Up Married, incorporating flashbacks in ascending order, made it a bit like hearing the punch-line then going back to fill in the joke.  After we play catch-up it is a pretty simple romance, modern in its ideals and alpha in its sex life with a HEA that everyone but our heroes could see coming.  Still it was an enjoyable piece of fluff that occupied an evening when I didn't really want to fill my head with anything weighty.<br /><br />I give this book three stars

014241493X|5.0|I may be slightly biased here since it appears that I am slowly falling head over heels in love with John Green's books. An amusing fact of his writing is that the characters in all of his books are very similar. Quentin, Miles and Colin are very similar thoughtful, sensitive and nerdy yet strangely intriguing guys who have put Margo, Katherine and Alaska on very high pedestals and have likened them to goddesses when in fact the girls they are obsessed with are very flawed and very human. And yet, every single one the characters is either someone you can relate to yourself or you know someone very much like them.<br /><br />Margo is that girl you either always wished you were, or you at least always wished you had known. I know I've always wished that I was a Margo. She's mysterious, fun, original, and appears to be the life of the party. But therein lies the problem. Appears. And that's what Paper Towns is about. That appearances can be deceiving. That someone (or something) that can appear to be so full of life and seem to have it all, could actually in fact be just an empty shell. Instead of being seen for what they truly are, they are simply seen the way everyone wants to see them.<br /><br />Quentin, or Q as everyone calls him, sets out on a search to find Margo, who has disappeared after their late night adventure. Armed with very few clues (which includes a heavily highlighted copy of Whitman's Leaves of Grass), Q begins to piece together the story of the real Margo Roth Spiegelman, who desperately wishes that someone would finally realize that she was not a fine and precious thing, but that she was just a girl.<br /><br />It's hard to read this book and not identify with at least one character. The struggles that Margo Roth Spiegelman (and yes, you will discover that you cannot just call her Margo) faces will mirror the same struggles we all face at the same age, as well as beyond. Quentin's stubbornness and eye for details mimics mine. And everyone has at least one Ben in their life. But what really seals the deal, and it sounds truly cliche to say (but oh so true) is that you will discover things about yourself while Q begins to decode the Margo puzzle.<br /><br />Bottom line? I pretty much fell in love with both Q and Margo Roth Spiegelman (especially With her Obsession of strange Capitalization). They have easily become to of my favorite characters ever written. Although, Radar isn't far behind. He has some of the FUNNIEST moments ever.east one Ben in their life.

0425263908|1.0|As the previous reviewers stated, this is pretty much fifty shades of Grey.  Though, I'm not sure if I agree that the writing was better. The dialogue sounded like fan fiction... And I found myself grinning sheepishly at the stupid things the characters said and did. I can suspend alot from my mind for the sake of being entertained, but this story was fifty shades of ridiculous. Total rip off, nothing original. And I'm only 120 pages into the book!

B008220BP2|4.0|Unfortunately you have to venture out in the cold to enjoy a movie entitled \\"Warm Bodies\\" and then you come to realize that the movie is mostly about `cold' bodies, the dead undead. Nicholas Hoult (\\"X-Men: First Class\\" and the upcoming \\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\") plays a zombie with thoughts named R, a name given because he can only remember that his human name started with an `R'. We're introduced to his thoughts early on and we see his desire to be something better than the feeble-brained stumbling zombie that he is. That, in a nutshell, is all you need to know.<br /><br />Just when you thought that zombie movies would probably never go away, but would never do anything remotely original, \\"Warm Bodies\\" shatters that. The movie is a tremendously creative twist on the genre. The zombie with thoughts gimmick goes a long way for director Jonathan Levine, but the movie as a whole stayed routine and didn't try to push the envelope much further. That being said, the soul of this movie isn't in the plot lines that it tells, but the search for life.<br /><br />I'm not sure if \\"Warm Bodies\\" is intending a deep message among its dry humor and romance, but a deep message may be its biggest asset. As R goes about his everyday zombie routine, he stumbles across a band of humans looking for medication and in that band is Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer \\"Take Me Home Tonight\\", \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\"). R instant becomes infatuated with the obviously attractive, tough-willed and vulnerable Julie. As the two of them bond in some pretty strange ways, the movie becomes a healing type movie. It becomes a slow walk toward humanity and life. The movie, about zombies, makes a pretty clear message that in a way, we all have zombie traits. Whether it be walking through life on our smart phones or just not living fully while we are here, \\"Warm Bodies\\" shows that we are all zombies, at times.<br /><br />I'm not completely sure that \\"Warm Bodies\\" is a smash hit or anything. To me, the story was way too routine and not challenging enough. Yet, the human and not-so-human elements of the film are top notch. The one thing I will say for \\"Warm Bodies\\" is that this is the kind of movie that will have a cult following and years from now, people will still enjoy watching it. It's nice little film that has more heart than most movies deserve. Most importantly, it's a movie about living, reminding us all not to take that for granted.way too routine and not challenging enough.

B000IJ79WU|4.0|The vision of Richard Donner for his two-set movie. The scenes and new effects create an atmosphere that he wanted to transmit at the time.<br />The only thing is that the ending is a little nonsense. Why would Superman turn the time back just because of Lois memories?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A modern day catcher in the rye. I couldn't put this book down. It's an incredible work of fiction. You won't be disappointed
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use it for teaching!  Helps to organize notes for my student, handouts, lesson plans, notes for myself and us shareable with students and parents.
1554512115|5.0|This book is adorable and empowering for little girls.  My first grader can read it by herself.  It's funny and has a great message.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book to study complex language techniques. More than that, however, it is a great novel that makes anybody's day better. It gives you the joy to live. Above all, it teaches you to race in the rain. It's a book for those who keep moving forward.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|this is exactly what i wanted. all 8 movies look great on blu-ray! a must buy for all harry potter fans
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Good so far, only 2 episodes into the season.... If the remaining episodes continue to be this intense then they got themselves a new Follower.....
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very nice app. It has nice graphics and fun games. Sometimes it is irritating having to wait for games to resume. Competitions and training is fun too.
B006OAB3ME|2.0|I always considered it a very bad sign when a musical artist (esp. one with a rock background) decides that it time to put out a collection of \\"standards\\".  And unfortunately Paul McCartney's Kisses on the Bottom has not changed my mind about this.<br /><br />The vast majority of songs here are listenable, even pleasant, and show case Paul's aging voice quite well.  However, there's a lack of energy by Paul and Diana Krall's backing band throughout.  The end result is bland, homogenized, and rather boring.  This wouldn't be so bad from someone like Rod Stewart (who hasn't had anything worthwhile to say since the mid 70s), but from an icon like Paul this is a massive disappointment.<br /><br />It has been 5 years since Paul has released a new studio album - 2007's [[ASIN:B000P2A242 Memory Almost Full]] - and he comes back with this?  I sincerely hope that this isn't a sign that Paul has run out of interesting or valuable things to tell us.
0142418471|1.0|honestly this book gave me a couple of laughs, but other than that I really hated it.  it was largely unreadable because it was so boring.  and dont get me started on the ridiculously unrealistic ending
B00632HWOG|5.0|It's quick and easy to use.  It bypasses the school's parental controls and that's what I wanted it to do.
0618918248|5.0|it's a good read and in addition has been helping me find sources for a class paper.  also it's really funny

B0058YPL66|5.0|i really like the show and decided to get the first season.  it was cheaper on here and it come in really good condition, very satisfied.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you need to pass the time this is a great game. It will keep you busy and it is fun
B0058YPGL6|5.0|love this show and it was alot cheaper on here than in stores.  Everything came in tact and there werent any scrathes or anything on the disc
0802473156|5.0|I have not finished this book but it seems to be hitting home on a lot of levels....Brings thought to the process of others.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|After finishing the latest adventure for Jack Ryan, I couldn't help but think, again, that Tom Clancy has predicted our current reality... The recent news about high level hacking of a prominent New York newspaper, the penetration of Twitter, with hints of state sponsorship from China, remind us that America may have be preparing for the previous war, and is slow to adapt to new challenges. I hope I'm wrong. In any case, Jack Sr. and Jr. have their hands full here, great read.
B00633W614|5.0|Love all his historical novels and I try to read them all.  Looking forward to the next book.  Great author
B007EW9ISM|3.0|I haven't used the Wacom Bamboo stylus, the Elago stylus, or the LunaTik, but I feel like those fall under a different type of stylus. When I write on my iPad, I don't write for extreme precision. I feel like you shouldn't be writing on an iPad if that is what you are trying to achieve. Since that is my view, my review will highlight the pros and cons that assume a similar view.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Feels natural for the writing surface<br />Well balanced<br />Durable<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Collects dust<br />Can lack responsiveness<br /><br />This stylus is great for those who want to jot down a quick thought, sketch out your ideas, or like to journal on your iPad. It is aimed at those who don't want expensive solutions that have touch sensitivity through a hardware+software solutions. It is minimalisitic and natural feeling. It feels like it is designed similar to a whiteboard marker and that makes sense to me. I don't feel the iPad capacitive surface is really designed for extreme precision with a writing utensil. Yes, solutions have come out that allow this to happen, but I haven't seen many stylus that you can just pick up and use to do this. When you take that into account, this stylus makes all the sense and feels very natural. I don't feel the fatigue I would normally have from using thinner stylus and I achieve the same type of response. You mix in its unique physique and Kickstarter background, it adds a little flare to being standout and different.<br /><br />One thing I have noticed over time is that the stylus started skipping some of my strokes. I have tried it on multiple tablets and the same exact thing happens. I contacted them about it and they got back to me EXTREMELY quick. They said the tip was probably not working well. It is basically a removable capacity rubber tip that anchors to a ribbed metal tip. They said they would send me a replacement tip, but I haven't received it and it has been almost two weeks. I don't feel the hasselis worth waiting for a new tip and seeing if it works. I would rather just try a new stylus that has some history of solid performance.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />After receiving my new tips, things are back to normal. I did decide to purchase the Jot Pro by Adonit, just as a comparison. As noted, writing experience on the iPad is not meant to be extremely accurate, but that isn't to say it isn't. Trying to do so with the Cosmonaut will leave you feeling disappointed. The style and size of the tip don't lend well to extreme accuracy. I notice this especially when trying to add touchups or dotting an i or crossing a t. I still equate using the Cosmonaut to a marker, especially with its fit in your hand.<br /><br />The Jot on the other hand feels like a pencil. If you are an artist, it will feel very familiar. It has a slightly heavier weight than a pencil, but still allows you to have agility with your strokes. At first I was skeptical of the tip, but I came across Jot early in my pursuit of a stylus. Since, they have added tips that mimic the response of mechanical pens and pencils and I like their design for protecting the stylus in transit. It is extremely accurate in my initial uses and I am excited to see what I can create with it.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|It was alright ,Not as good as I thought .But was fun  to see Lincoln as a Vampire slayer! Should be a presidential requirement!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A powerful, well-written autobiographical document.  Very inspirational for those who believe in an existence after death, and  highly recommended to those who don't.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I'm not a fan of Gay People, but I do like Ellen and her humor is relatively clean.  This was a fun book to read, it gave me a few laughs, and it was a good read.
1400097029|3.0|This is a novel about loss and memories, but throughout it seems strangely detached, as though the narrator is attempting to feel the appropriate emotions but his lifetime habits of deception prevent him from honestly confronting his tragedies. He seems to be equated with the vast indifference of the sea. At least that is my interpretation, but the meaning here is very nebulous, and alternate interpretations would probably be just as valid.<br /><br />The plot finds the narrator returning, following the death of his wife, to a seaside town where he spent summers as a child. He remembers most his interaction with the Grace family and the role they played in his first experiences of love and death. Interspersed with these are his memories of his wife's year-long illness and death.<br /><br />The writing is oh-so-elegant and beautiful that that often seems to be the whole purpose of the novel--to display the author's prodigious talent. The book is a delight to read, but in the end I felt cheated somehow. The ending is somewhat predictable and more than a little sensationalistic.<br /><br />This book won Britain's Man Booker Prize in 2005. I would recommend it with reservations.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|M six  year daughter old loves horses.  This is the perfect app for her.  I enjoy using it as well.
0679731369|2.0|This is a peculiar book, for sure. It is classified as a novel, but the plot is sketchy and fragmented. The narrator is a retired doctor who is an amateur expert on the French author Gustave Flaubert, who wrote Madame Bovary. While touring museums devoted to Flaubert, he comes upon two different stuffed parrots purported to be the inspiration for one of the author's greatest short stories. He becomes obsessed with discovering which parrot is the \\"real\\" one, and in the search process reveals details about his own life which seem to mirror the events in Madame Bovary.<br /><br />The majority of the book is given over to a recounting by the narrator of events from Flaubert's life, including quotes from his letters to friends and lovers, and quotes about him from people who knew him and from critics. One chapter contains three different chronologies of Flaubert's life, each offering a different viewpoint, even though covering the same facts. Another chapter is a playful \\"Dictionary of Accepted Ideas\\" about Flaubert. Still another chapter is an examination, with a list of discussion questions to be answered.<br /><br />This all coils together to make observations on such subjects as how art mirrors life and vice versa; on literary criticism and critics; on the futility of ever really knowing the \\"truth\\" about another person.<br /><br />Barnes is clever and witty. I learned some very interesting information about Flaubert. I admire the author's skill in accomplishing his purpose. But I did not like the book that much. I must confess that I prefer my novels to have more plot and less intellectual preening. I felt all along that the author's main effort was to impress with how clever and knowledgeable he is.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Heartwarming. Nice to see someone taking the time to come to know an elder and learning the profound meaning of their life.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The episodes were well written and storylines well executed.  Too bad the series lasted only a half a season.  I am glad that they came back and did the movie which was excellent.  If you like Serenity then this is a must have in your collection.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game! I just wish it had more options like different breeds to choose from. Other than that, it's great!
B004P7CMDM|2.0|Does not deserve to be in with the original Crow Movie.  Storyline is crappy and the acting is poor.  The City of Angels only redeeming feature is it had decent actors in it.  Wicked Prayer was just flat horrible.  I wound up tossing this after watching the video.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The dvd content is great. You've seen it right. iTunes doesn't have it in store even though it has other release of previous chapter of series. DvD completes the movies I bought. I trust Amazon.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Well written and excellent storyline with out of this world graphcs.  I like this better that Independence Day and Battleship.  If you are into battles vs. aliens this is a must have.

B004LROUNG|4.0|i like reading john grisham's work. this book, however, has many typographical errors, especially in spelling. auto correct is evidently being used and changes some of the words completely. i would love to be a proof-reader. i love to read and hate it when i have to back track a word or two because of errors. i do love his work though and his books are not eh only ones that i find errors in. i find tort cases very interesting.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I am in love with this series!  My coworker got me addicted and now all I want to do is hang out with Jamie and Claire and not work!
B001AEF6BI|3.0|This is a great movie.  Loved it when I was a teen and love it still.  The only complaint I have is that it skipped several times during playing.  Doesn't look scratched, but it did hesitate several times mid- way through.
B00B16WZBE|5.0|I saw Eric Burdon perform 2 days after this album was released. He sounds as good as he ever has. This is one of his most personal ever. It has songs that  will make you laugh and songs that will make you cry. Wonderful album!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great app I couldn't wait for the sequal everyone should have this game and it free I love it best game ever
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like the game except that if you use a gem sometimes it closes the game and takes your gem anyway.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I love the movie and the tape came fast and undamage.  Nice clear sound and picture. My whole family enjoyed sitting down and watching this.

B008HK3XOU|5.0|I've used the Marware Vibe 7\\" Kindle Fire cover for several months now.  It is wearing very, very well.  It still looks brand new, and I carry my Kindle Fire just about everywhere.  The cover is a great product for the price.  It keeps my Kindle secure and protected and allows me flexibility to fold the cover back when I hold it to read, or it props up to a variety of angles when I want to set it on the table beside me.  It doesn't slip and slide.  It's a really good deal for the price.  I'm very pleased with it.  I love the red.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love it! Anyone who enjoys any kind of interactive game with the character would love this game. You will really get into the game if you want to unlock a character you really want. I love this game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so addictive and I prefer it to temple run because you don't have to tilt your device.
B00A8LRIEW|2.0|I have been following them since ... Joy Division came out.  Saw them live a few times.  Loved them until.... Technique or may be Republic...  This is a bad album....what happend to the newOrder that reinventing their music and album cover design with every release?  This album sucks!<br />UPDATE: ok, ok, I 're-listened' to the album again.  It has a few ok songs on it, and that's it!  Lost Sirens sounds like a Sumner's ego-trip, very few Peter Hook's bass-driven songs which made JD and No famous.  newOrder is never the same since Gilbert's gone.  The music lacks that playful element she broght to the band since PC&L.  You can listen to: Age of consent, your silence face, Leave me alone, the Perfect Kiss, True faith, Regret etc...  I think they were at the forefront of the industry and now they are mediocre..  may be 2 and a half star?  I have read they may tour in America with Gilbert, and without Hook this year, we shall see....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So enjoyable! love it! I play it everyday and enjoy it so much! Can't stop playing it. Every day i play it and have fun.

1574214276|4.0|This is a very enjoyable book, and a very well written intro to zentangles. Let me take a minute to explain the concept of zentangles for those who don't know (I'll explain the 'but' in the title in a bit).<br /><br />Think of zentangles as a zen or meditative way of doodling. You take a square card, put some marks in the corners- or really any random location- and using a pencil, connect those dots in a loose, 'unthinking' manner. The whole point is that you CANNOT make a mistake, because whatever you wind up with, you work with; there is no erasing. From there, you switch to a pen and use patterns to fill in the spaces, or if those spaces inspire you with images, go from there.  I have to say that so far, I'm having a lot of fun with it and will probably purchase more books. There are books for various patterns and levels of experience.<br /><br />I purchased the book based on (almost literally) glowing reviews by people who had really gotten into them. I was trying to jumpstart my artistic side, and the whole concept of sparking creativity by drawing on a small card reminded me of a writing exercise I was taught, where you try to tell an entire story in one brief sentence. The small space, limited colors and short amount of time force you to stretch those creative muscles. I can see this being helpful to many people; artists, writers, or even people looking for a new way to meditate. The authors know their stuff and are all certified zentangle teachers (czt), which brings me to the 'but' in the title.<br /><br />On the page called \\"zentangle resources\\", there is information about respecting the zentangle copyright (which is a good thing), and becoming a czt. I wish wholeheartedly they had put this at the end of the book. The tone was not unpleasant, but it cast the rest of the book, and indeed the whole 'zentangle movement' in a negative light. Between that and the near dazzling reviews, it started to come across as kind of cult-ish. The endorsements scattered liberally throughout the book pretty much all stressed the importance of taking a class and the excitement of being a teacher. Then, the insistence on pigma micron pens and the notion that you COULD do zentangles on 'regular' paper, but it's sooo much nicer to do them on 'official' zentangle cards, well, that bugged the heck out of me. At approximately  50 cents a card, and considering the cost of the pens, this was no longer a very inexpensive hobby.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong- I applaud the creators, Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas, for coming up with the idea, which really seems to work for many people. I don't know, maybe I'm too much of a 'granola' kind of girl, but the whole notion of such exclusivity and conformation seems to belie the very concept of zen.<br /><br />All that aside, I can honestly say that I do really enjoy doing zentangles, and will purchase other books in the future. I WILL NOT, however, be puchasing any 'official' (my choice of words) zentangle products. I've found that paper coasters (approx. 16 cents each) make wonderful subtitutes for zentangle tiles. Being rigid makes it really easy to punch a hole in the corner and attach a ring type binder for an instant book, and you can use both sides! Also, any gel type pen works great on them.<br /><br />So, while I DO recommend this book, I also encourage you to keep the zen in zentangle and use what you've got on hand or can get cheaply. I also really, really encourage the authors and other certified zentangle teachers out there to not push product so overtly. For some strange reason, it reminds me of the Tupperware and Home Interior parties my mom used to go to; yikes!berally throughout the book pretty much all stressed the importance of taking a class and the excitement of being a teacher.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|A great story about work ethics and leadership. Any leader should watch this, as the movie is loaded with lessons.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed all the twists and turns. The story is masterfully presented. It felt like a 20 course meal with exquisite tastes in each delicious bite.
B0085A9HXS|4.0|This is an excellent example of what an action movie is all about.  It is packed with spectacularly choreographed fight scenes.  The director really focuses on these scenes and you get very detailed blow by blow sequences.  I wasn't in the mood to read any subtitles, so I viewed with the English track and the new sound mix.  The language is very explicit and is similar to Scarface with its F-bomb usage.  The plot is very thin, so check you brains at the door.<br /><br />All in all this was a very entertaining, albeit gruesome, movie.  It will get your heart pumping and adrenaline going.  You will not be disappointed.
0763644765|5.0|I have no idea why kids like this book so much, but my daughter and her friend are obsessed with it.  They are both 2.
B009MF56GC|3.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the original Expendables.  I like that all of the actors had more screen time.  The movie was a very entertaining and funny adventure.  The play on old one liners was good to see.  Chuck Norris was an excellent addition.  I wish that they make a third Expendables film and include Jackie Chan in it.  They could focus more on the comedy and it would hilarious with him.<br /><br />Good action flick with some comedy thrown in.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really good I have played it many times. this game is fun for all ages. this game keep you busy or your kids busy when your on the road. I love it.

B008FSCNTK|3.0|Since forever, jazz artists who try to \\"cross over\\" will catch grief from jazz purists who started out as their fans.  They are accused of \\"selling out\\" and urged to go back to \\"real jazz.\\"  I disregarded reviews in this vein unless they offer a real critique of the performance.<br /><br />  Diana Krall is to be credited for going far afield from the too familiar jazz standards that have comprised much of her work. Unfortunately, to me her interpretations of these interesting songs seem limited in range of emotion (and range of pitch, for that matter).  Tempos (even the faster ones, as in \\"I'm a Little Mixed Up\\") seem just to plod along.  The worst offender is \\"Let It Rain.\\" Did she notice what the lyrics said as she slogged through that one?<br /><br />  Famous jazz artists who try to use that springboard to cross over as vocalists are going to be judged as vocalists.  Are her performances on par with past crossover heroines like Sarah Vaughn or Peggy Lee?  Nope.  But as the cover photo clearly estalishes, she is hardly in the twilight of her career.  Good luck!

044042321X|5.0|the art is even more beautiful than it appears on it's page on here. I got this for my best friend, and she LOVED it. I'll have to steal it when she's done so I can read it, too!

B001GMQALY|1.0|Oh my goodness, this movie was terrible.  I don't know if it's because I skipped over this and have seen Sliver and Eyes Wide Shut before seeing this, but whatever sexual boundaries they are trying to push in this film seen dated and trite and my date and I were really disappointed that neither character killed themselves or the other on at the end.
B005LAIGIM|5.0|Simple...yet very profound message!<br />I was prepared to watch a comedy but pleasantly surprised by a deep message that all of us need to be reminded of on a regular basis.

B0076794IO|1.0|A good concept that wasn't executed well enough or followed through.  No tension as almost all the action takes place through the narrative of the protagonist. Wouldn't waste my money.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|A great game, but does it graduate to a different level?  You get all the prizes, but takes forever to get to use them.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|Wonderfull book.  Well written novel set in a time and a place that we don't understand enough.  Extremely worth reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very addicting game. It wasn't that fun at first but now I can't stop playing it. I recommend it to all.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|***** SPOILER ALERT ******<br /><br />The funny thing is, when Once Upon a Time premiered, I really wasn't sure about it. I watched half of the pilot and then skipped the entire season because I thought it was pretty hokey. Then, when season 1 came out on Netflix, I watched it for lack of anything else. (There really isn't that much good sci-fi/fantasy out there right now.) It might be a bit too wholesome and hokey STILL, but it's really grown into its own. In season 2 the evil - and might I add very sexy - queen Regina is trying to reform for her adopted son Henry. And let me tell you I am a sucker for a dark haired, troubled soul, who wishes to change and become a better person.<br /><br />I give Once Upon a Time 5 stars and urge doubters to give it a try. I'd rate it PG-13 for a few swear words here and there. Its very family friendly, but if you are a lesbian see if you can find the subtext. :-)

B000MDDSB8|3.0|not my cup of tea, but the special effects were AMAZING!<br /><br />Really more for teenagers, but the summary sounded interesting so I checked it out.<br /><br />The main character reminded me too much of a certain lead wolf of a certain series of movies....<br /><br />The script could have been stronger. I felt I was missing too much information and background on the characters. They kinda just threw you in the middle and let you flounder around for scraps of info.
B00136JOVG|5.0|Billy Joel is certainly one of the best song writers and singers of the last few decades. This collection provides the best of his music in one place. It is an excellent value for the money.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|It was a little short and the puzzles are a little easy, but perfect for a mobile game.  You can start and stop as needed without losing your place.  Game play is smooth, graphics are good, there's nothing I didn't like except I wanted it to last longer, great game!&nbsp;
B009HEJXFS|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Unlike other sequels, the MIB sequels are as good as the original -- always entertaining to us!  :)

B008CJ0KBU|5.0|**** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ALERT ****<br /><br />The first episode of Lost Girl was truly amazing. I fell in love with the show the minute I laid eyes on Bo (Anna Silk) and was hopelessly lost when I met plucky, street wise Kenzi (Ksensia Solo). Where and when have you ever seen a show daring enough to make the main character a bisexual sex chi sucking succubus??<br /><br />The chemistry between Anna and Ksensia (sorry if I'm spelling that wrong) is alone worth watching this show for. It comes out in their characters and is wonderful to watch. You feel like they really care about each other. Like they're family. And that's something neither of them has had in a really long time.<br /><br />There are some plot holes... better scripts then others... and actors struggling to define their characters... but... I kept watching, and season 3 - airing now - is so worth it. Anna Silk is sexier than ever and the characters and scripts are stronger than before.<br /><br />It is NOT for kids. Rated R for sex, partial nudity, and language.<br /><br />But don't let that stop you. Bo the Succubus, the Fae, and the humans Kenzi and Lauren are worth watching.

0307352153|4.0|Sometimes in American culture it seems like the only way to succeed, in school, in business, in life, is to be loud, to be outspoken, to be gregarious.  But what about the introverts?  In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, Susan Cain writes that not only have many introverts been successful, they have qualities that can give them an edge in creativity and productivity.<br /><br />Much our our Western conventional wisdom seems to favor the bold.  The picture of a leader, whether in politics, business, education, or social life, is usually the picture of an assertive, outspoken type, charging ahead with confidence.  But Cain cites study after that study to demonstrate that, for example, TV pundits (outspoken extroverts by definition) \\"make worse predictions about political and economic trends than they would by random chance.  And the very worst prognosticators tend to be the most famous and the most confident.\\"  We fail to \\"distinguish between good presentation skills and true leadership ability,\\" promoting on the basis of being a good talker, not on the basis of good ideas.  Even in the church, extroversion has come to be a requirement for ministry, so that \\"many evangelicals come to associate godliness with sociability.\\"<br /><br />In spite of the evidence that \\"college students who tend to study alone learn more over time than those who work in groups,\\" that \\"open-plan office hove been found to reduce productivity and impair memory,\\" and \\"excessive stimulation seems to impede learning,\\" education and the workplace still tend toward the extrovert.  Classrooms are designed for group learning, with desks set in groups, rather the rows.  (I provoked the ire of my principal when I insisted that my seventh-grade math classroom be arranged in rows, in hopes of promoting more discipline and independent work.  My principal insisted on groups.  I lost that battle, disastrously.)  Schools continue their emphasis on group work because it supposedly prepares student better for the group environments they will encounter in the workplace.<br /><br />Quiet is a great resource for managers, teachers, parents, and others who lead and work with introverts. It's a simple as recognizing that everyone has different styles of learning and working, and that we ought to be prepared to adapt the way we relate to others.  I have always thought of myself as an extrovert (I was voted \\"most outgoing\\" in my senior yearbook), but Cain helped me recognize my introverted side, acknowledging the tremendous value of the introverted life and the contributions introverts have to make.<br /><br />Thanks to Waterbrook/Multnomah Blogging for Books for the complimentary review copy!edly prepares student better for the group environments they will encounter in the workplace.<br /><br />Quiet is a great resource for managers, teachers, parents, and others who lead and work with introverts.

B00ANGICRE|4.0|The remarkably nuanced performance of John Hawkes provides the beating heart of this small 2012 independent film based on the life of poet and journalist Mark O'Brien who contracted polio at age six and spent the rest of his life in an iron lung unable to control his muscles. A chameleonic actor whose familiarity to me comes from memorably villainous turns in [[ASIN:B003EYVXTG Winter's Bone]] and [[ASIN:B006Z7XNVK Martha Marcy May Marlene]], Hawkes brings unexpected pathos and humor as well as a painfully realistic physicality to a role that could have easily fallen prey to the more stereotypical, life-affirming treatment you would likely find in a disease-of-the-week TV-movie. It doesn't completely escape the predictable dimensions of the genre, but the film's overriding honest sensibility and lack of cheap sentiment probably have a lot to do with the director and screenwriter Ben Lewin whose own childhood bout with polio has left him to a lifetime on crutches.<br /><br />Based on the subject's own writing, the story picks up Mark's life in Berkeley as he is taken care of by a series of caretakers, one a comely student named Amanda with whom he falls in love. Despite an obvious fondness for him, she cannot reciprocate his feelings for her, which leads him to seek counsel with his minister, Father Brendan. Their comic interactions eventually lead Mark at age 38 to search for the services of a sex surrogate. Enter Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a content wife and mother who matter-of-factly tells Mark that she will be his sexual guide for six sessions in which she plans to heighten his body awareness, lead him toward intercourse, and prepare him for a sexually fulfilling life. Perhaps not coincidentally, one of Helen Hunt's best early roles was as the married woman learning to cope with her lover's paraplegic state in [[ASIN:B008SGVSMM The Waterdance]]. Here the actress returns twenty years later to a similar role as Cheryl, and she turns in a terrifically brave and assured performance. Her nudity is presented in such a nonchalant manner that there isn't a hint of exploitation about it.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that the physical and emotional intertwining of their relationship gets complicated but not in a way that is entirely predictable. It's clear that Cheryl is dealing with conflicts of her own, including a conversion to Judaism, that have put her in a more vulnerable state than she may have realized. In fact, none of the characters' feelings are telegraphed in a standard by-the-numbers way, and it is a testament to Lewin's filmmaking skill that he trusts his actors so fully to inhabit the roles. While Father Brendan may come across as an overgrown Berkeley hippie stereotype at times, William H. Macy is funny and endearing in his few scenes. Other smaller turns are solid - Moon Bloodgood as poker-faced attendant Vera, Annika Marks as open-hearted Amanda, and in near-cameos, Adam Arkin as Cheryl's sullen stay-at-home husband and Rhea Perlman as the cheery (pardon the pun) Mikvah lady. While there are formulaic moments that don't quite transcend the story's more inspirational aspects, the film is well worth seeking out.rformance.

B000ENC5YW|5.0|Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones play their roles to the hilt. The locations are fascinating, the methods completely unexpected, and the plot twists keep you enthralled. I never tire of watching this movie because everything is so well done.
B00979CS50|4.0|It is good - not great.  Some of the songs are goofy - typical Neil.  Get back to Sleeps with Angels, my friend.
B003VS0CXS|3.0|I had watched this movie as a kid with my mom and remembered liking it. I got it for my family to watch and we lost interest pretty quickly. I don't remember it being this strange. Dick Van Dyke is awesome as always but be prepared to be fairly confused at some parts. It took us about 3 times of coming back to it to finally finish it. I did like that it was family friendly (no cussing or inappropriate scenes) but I wouldn't recommend it to small kids because it is so out there. Definitely living in the land of imagination.

B007ZTLLMK|4.0|I love flying games - fighter jets, airplanes, helps, you name it.  And I've always wanted to have a real RC help but to get a good one that actually works is apparently out of my budget.<br /><br />So when I saw Helidroid 3D offered as FAOTD in the Amazon App store, I was excited to download it and give it a try.<br /><br />The tutorial is great, it shows very clearly what you're supposed to be doing and how to control the copter.  You can control it with the accelerometer by tilting and touching the screen or use the on-screen joystick.  I found them both equally responsive and easy to use.<br /><br />In the game you're given missions to complete which get progressively more difficult so the game stays challenging.  I didn't find any of the first 3-4 I've played to be too difficult or frustrating.<br /><br />If you like piloting flying  machines and enjoy a game that challenges you, I think you'll have fun playing this one.<br /><br />I played this on my Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire original.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was engaging. I read it rather quickly and enjoyed most all if it. It is, however, a love story between 2 high school seniors. Go into it knowing that. Quick read. Worth the time.
0385333846|5.0|Mr. Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors. He had a different way of viewing life and can make me laugh out loud on a bus while reading his work. Slaughterhouse is trying to reason with the devastation of war. Why this and why that. Dresden was bombed, but why? So much was lost in human accomplishment that could never be replaced. Army grunts are pawns and all you can do is live or die by chance. A good read, but a downer.
1451638647|5.0|BRAND NEW BOOK! WOO!<br /><br />Premise: Ivan Vorpatril's settled into his life. He likes his job, he's found a certain peace with most of his relations, his old girlfriends are all married, and he's okay with that too. That is, until assignment on Komarr brings him into contact with one sly ImpSec informer, one angry blue-skinned dancer, and one lovely woman in danger. It's Ivan to the rescue, although he has no idea how far his gallant impulses will bring them all!<br /><br />Yay! A new Vorkosigan Saga book! (This is either book 16, 15, or 14, depending on how you count them.) I loved this; it was completely adorable. Getting to spend an entire book with Ivan is downright restful in some ways, and you can really get into his subtle strengths as a character. Tej is delightful as well, although in the middle of the book I sometimes had moments where it was harder to relate to her. That's just the kind of person she is, though, because of where she grew up.<br /><br />Byerly Vorrutyer is back as a major player, and where By shows up, trouble can't be far behind. Lady Alys Vorpatril, Simon Illyan, Duv Galeni and Emperor Gregor all get moments to shine in the supporting cast, as well as Admiral Desplains,  Ivan's boss at Ops. Count Falco Vorpatril even pops in with a memorable cameo.<br /><br />As a late entry in the series, there are plenty of little callbacks to earlier adventures, but with maybe one or two exceptions, that never holds anything back, just adds a fun layer. It's certainly better to have read the books up to this point, or at least the books Ivan is in, but I could see someone picking this up blind and enjoying it. It's adventure-romantic science-fiction! What's not to love?<br /><br />I more or less knew where this story was headed from early on, but was definitely surprised by the route it took to get there. As usual, the pace was gripping, the characters compelling, the humor laugh-out-loud-in-public funny.<br /><br />Not much more to say really. I'll have to read it again before I know whether it'll become an all-time favorite, but it's a solid entry in an outstanding series.ll have to read it again before I know whether it'll become an all-time favorite, but it's a solid entry in an outstanding series.
B004UC4HCG|4.0|3rd time is a charm... The first Shuttle box I got was dead in the water, but Amazon immediately replaced. The 2nd one would not work either, so Shuttle Tech support had me send it to them where they resolved the problem and returned it to me.<br /><br />So far that is the only problem, and it has been working great ever since!

B004GHNIRK|5.0|This remains the finest rendition of the Hugo novel.  With respect to content and quality this DVD is superb. Les Miserables is serious literature and not intended for a Hollywood musical, but that is the subject for another review.<br />There are two versions of the story on this disc.  The first is the 1935 film with Frederic March and Charles Laughton and the second, on the flip side, is with Michael Rennie, Robert Newton and Debra Paget.  Debra Paget?  Yes Debra Paget!<br />Once you have seen Frederic March and Charles Laughton there is no need to waste you time viewing any other remake of Les Miserables.<br />The movie industry persists in re- filming classic movies.  I suspect, if you search long enough, you may find two or three additional remakes.  Do not waste you time.
B00926J3K6|1.0|sadly, spectral analysis shows that all the 24-bit 96kHz content on the blu-ray (from the maximum-$$ edition) is upsampled from 48kHz.  this includes the remixes, the original mix, the bonus tracks, and the 'keep that one nick' sessions.  ditto the &#34;lossless&#34; hi rez content on the dvd.  ditto the &#34;lossless&#34; hi-rez content on all the other 40th anniversary kc releases. bummer! :(  so no disrespect to the album per se, just to the MISLEADING MARKETING of it as 96kHz to those would buy it for this reason.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought this first for my husband for Christmas, and then for myself after trying it out.  It's quick and easy to install.  No issues with setup.  No special knowledge required.<br /><br />The sound quality is fantastic.  I'm getting a lot more out of my games than I used to, especially The Secret World.  The mic mutes when flipped up which is a good feature, though I am mostly a push-to-talk user.  The design cups around the ears instead of pushes on them, which is a huge plus.  It really blocks out a lot of outside noise.  In fact, even though we're in the same room, my husband and I jump onto voice chat when we're wearing this headset because it's easier to hear each other that way.<br /><br />I only have one issue with this, and that's the lack of adjustability for my head size.  I wear a medium in hats, but this is built just a little too big, as if the designers didn't expect average-sized women to want to use it.  It starts at large and goes up to XXL.  At the smallest adjustment, I can't wear it for long periods because it sits too low and pushes on the sides of my jaws.  It gets really uncomfortable.  If I need to wear it for long, I have to wrap a towel or fabric around the top several times to get it to sit in a higher position.  It's a little awkward, but since other headsets I've found in my price range are also built large, it seems like I don't have much of a choice.  I'm picking up some foam and fabric from the craft store and some velcro to sew myself custom padding.  That's what knocked this down to a 4 star review in my book, but it's irrelevant for anybody with a large head.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I was excited when the box set I ordered off line came in. Then I started watching and I was disappointed. I kept waiting for it to get better. But episode after episode was disappointing. It was so fake and stupid and boring. I mean some of the story lines were okay but it wasn't realistic. The best thing was i could resale on Amazon at least i thought so. I tried to post on my seller account and they said they are no longer allowing season 1 to be sold here..wtf..now I am out of $17..what a  waste of money..I really enjoy the vampire diaries..its wholesome and good. True Blood is soft porn with a lot of unnecessary cursing.

B007ZLKK9I|5.0|Im a bearles fan and more particularly a George Harrisson fan, so it is not surprising that I loved this film. But even I got new insights into George's character and a deepened respect for his musical ability<br /><br />. Paul Mccartney noted that whenever he or John wrote a song for an album while the album was was actually being recorded, they would just give George a brief overvirew and a quick look at it hours before they actually recorded the song. Paul was not only amazed how quickly George got the chords down but frequently added his own riffs which made the song better.<br /><br /> But there was an in depth look at George's beliefs which made him a an irreplaceable human being even with his shortcomings which were not glossed over. Just a brilliant work by a brilliant director.

B0017ZB8M6|5.0|This album is one of the few that I can listen to from start to finish without disliking or skipping any of the songs. It starts with One of the Boys, an amazing, fun, poppy rockish song. Then comes I Kissed A Girl, the iconic hit that still sounds fresh. Next is Waking Up In Vegas, a good song which is underrated by the general public. Thinking of You, which didn't perform well when it was released as a single, is one of her best songs and is filled with emotion. Mannequin comes after, which has a good instrumental but the lyrics aren't the best. Ur So Gay is called 'immature' by some, but I see it as smart & funny. Hot N Cold, the best song on the album, is pop perfection. If You Can Afford Me should've been a single and is instantly infectious. It's connected to Lost, which is another heartfelt high point. Self Inflicted is probably one of the least known songs, which isn't fair because it has a catchy melody. I'm Still Breathing is the second best song, and Fingerprints is a song you can picture being performed in a huge stadium. Overall, this album is full of amazing moments and definitely worth listening to.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Good quick read, ESP for  teens except if you think they shouldn't be having sex-- then don't rec it to a teen! well written but very melodramatic. Some Unexpected twists and turns. It was worth the $4 kindle price.

B009EP3C34|3.0|Ke$ha's second studio album was very anticipated by the general public and by Ke$ha herself who described it as a new genre of music with rock and pop influences. However, it turned out to be a generic, safe album filled with nothing new aside from a few barely noticeable influences on a few tracks. Tracks like All That Matter (The Beautiful Life) and C'Mon are pure radio candy and offer no real substance to the album. Warrior and Dirty Love are just plain filler, along with Love Into The Light which tries to be 'deep' but sounds almost kiddie. The album also includes Ke$ha's worst song: Wherever You Are, which sounds like an unfinished demo. Wonderland is an okay song which I liked at first but soon got bored of. Only Wanna Dance With You was better in its previous demo form, in my opinion. Supernatural has a dreamy chorus and an amazing bridge, but all of that is ruined by the chainsaw-sounding verses. The album does have some great songs, though. All of the bonus tracks sans Last Goodbye are very good, as is Thinking of You. The album's high point is Crazy Kids, which sounds like a perfect summer single without being too generic. All in all, the album is okay but definitely not good enough for a two-year absence.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show, cannot say enough about how great this series is. Just very upset that some of the main characters are not going to be on any longer..

B008220BLG|4.0|Here is the first surprise of 2013 and it's another zombie movie.  Well, not your typical zombie movie.  It's a bit of a romantic comedy.  Confused?  Well, me too.  My first inclination was to stay away.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some zombies in film going back to the slow walkers of George Romero.<br /><br />In this take, a cataclysmic event has struck the world and turned most humans into the undead.  They appear to be just like your stereotypical zombies.  But there is also another zombie type.  One that has eventually eaten his or her own body parts and exists as a skeleton known as \\"bonies.\\"  We learn this from our zombie hero known as \\"R\\" (excellent Nicholas Hoult).  He can't remember his full name but he thinks it begins with an R.  \\"R\\" is our guide and narrator and he's witty and smarter than your typical zombie.  He, along with his best zom-buddy \\"M\\" (Rob Corddry) communicate with a few grunts and groans and eventually they eke out a few words.<br /><br />While on a search for dinner they come across a gaggle of young humans, themselves out gunning for zombies.  Violence ensues and \\"R\\" manages to kill and consume one of the young men (Dave Franco).  One of the results of a zombie eating a human brain is the victim's memories float around in the zombies mind, kind of like a dream.  \\"R\\" sees a young woman (Teresa Palmer) who is also the girlfriend of his last meal.  About to be somebody's desert, \\"R\\" rescues her and takes her back to his home in an abandon airplane.<br /><br />As time moves on \\"R\\" develops feelings and a sense of responsibility for Julie (Palmer).  Something has stirred body chemicals and slowly, he is changing.  This is a surprisingly charming and funny movie probably aimed at the \\"Twilight\\" admirers.  But it also has a terrific script, a couple with true charisma and an interesting twist on the whole zombie genre.  Congrats to Jonathan Levine (\\"50/50\\") for an excellent screenplay and wonderful direction...and a nice new year surprise.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE:  The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It looks very good although there is some definite color alterations in the original film that carry over here.  The bad zombies (Boneys) look pretty lame in the CGI department and this transfer shows that detail more so than I remember in the theater.

It looks very good although there is some definite color alterations in the original film that carry over here.  The bad zombies (Boneys) look pretty lame in the CGI department and this transfer shows that detail more so than I remember in the theater.

0812993357|5.0|Wow! If you are into fashion or just curious about all of the beautiful, talented and artist people, this is a must read.  It's a \\"Who's Who\\" of the fashion world.  What young person hasn't dreamed of becoming a famous model, travelling the world and meeting other beautiful people.  Well Grace Coddington has certainly done that and more.  I am a little more than envious as she made out with Mick Jagger when they were both young. (He was a heart throb when I was young)  She worked as a model for Elle, Queen, Vogue, Mademoiselle, Harper's Bazaar, and others.  She was married to Michael Chow at one point.  She has been photographed by some of the most famous photographers in the world.  She is friends with many of the top designers and artists.  The book is filled with pictures which tell a story of their own.  If you have ever wondered how some of these people got started or what their personalities are like, this is a tell all.  If there is such a thing as reincarnation, I want to come back as a designer in the fashion world.  What a life!!!!!!
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|Searching for Sugar Man was fascinating. To think he was so famous in South Africa and nobody here knew about it, including him. WOW... The first part of the movie was a little slow but the end was fascinating...I would LOVE to know who got all his money when his music was selling millions. I really liked his music, now I want to buy it!!<br />I would have liked to know more about his personal life!! Totally worth the rental!
B008I34ZG6|5.0|if you only own one frank zappa cd this is the one you should get. all the songs on it are worthy of play.his music is just fun to hear.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Okay Guys.  You've seen Temple Run 1 Now Don't Waste Youre Time On That Game ' Try Temple Run 2
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season had so many unexpected twists and turns and of the three has the most drama.  I won't give the ending away but it just took my breath away.  It is my dearest hope that they are filming season 4 right now.  One change I would like to see is more episodes per season; 6 episodes is not nearly enough.  If you haven't watched any of this series I highly recommend starting at the beginning and watch seasons 1 & 2 first. If you have Amazon Prime its free. You get a lot more of the back story and understand the dynamics between the characters.  I say without a moments hesitation that it is the best series on television today!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie is worth the see, if for no other reason to get a jolt from being indoctrinated into Western culture and also to get a shift from the security of living on land and not having to face any of Nature's violence in disasters.<br /><br />In the beginning of the movie there is a nice scene showing what Yashoda experienced which is described in the Srimad Bhagavatam. She was peering into Krishna's mouth and saw galaxies in the view. The hero of the film was being told this story by his mother, something which many women in India do with their infants.<br /><br />This movie is centered on a ship wreck but everything about the ship wreck was realistic in the sense that boats, even large ships do sometime reach an impasse with very colossal waves.<br /><br />The only human who survived this wreck is the teenaged boy who is the hero of the story but he does so with a zebra, a tiger, an orangutan and a hyena. As it worked out the zebra and orangutan were killed by the hyena and the hyena was killed by the lion.<br /><br />The hero of the story is then left with the lion in a fairly large lifeboat. They are drifting around in the Pacific Ocean. The hero has to improvise to survive, so he makes a raft from some oars and lift jackets. He ties that to the lifeboat and he lives on this raft while the tiger has the lifeboat to itself.<br /><br />At a certain point the hero gets enough courage to begin terrorizing the tiger, which comes under subjugation to some degree. They drift into an area where flying fish abound which makes it easy to get something to eat, since the fish fly into the lifeboat and become stranded. They enter areas of the sea where there are fluorescent fish and algae, which causes the hero to marvel at the wonders of nature.<br /><br />Other storms come up, especially one which was so bad that the hero begins to speak to God or to speak as if he perceived God. This part of the movie gives one the consideration about if there is a God who supervises life and death.<br /><br />Is there really such a God or do human beings only imagine God at their emotional convenience when they run up to disaster? If a man feels a sting on his elbow and scratches it, should the chiggers which are sliced apart by the man's finger nail, think that such violence was the act of an angry vicious Almighty God?<br /><br />Is nature being wielded by God or by gods or by powerful entities who can use it the way a human uses his hand or foot?<br /><br />I feel that the most realistic part of this movie was the part where the hero and the tiger find the life raft had drifted to a floating island which was a mass of cannibalistic vegetation. This was a place where during the day some meerkats fed on fish and vegetation, but during the night the island converted into a place where any creature which was on the ground level was dissolved by chemicals. Only those creatures which could sleep high up in trees were spared death.<br /><br />The hero decided not the stay on that island. With the lion, he left to roam the wide Pacific again.<br /><br />If we consider our situation it is factually in a way that everything in material nature is cannibalistic. Everything including the bodies we use will be subjected to chemical decomposition sooner or later. This just happens to be the reality here.<br /><br />Eventually the hero and the lion are beached in Mexico after the life boat drifts across the Pacific. Here is where the story takes a transcendental turn. The lion heads off into the jungle and the hero is found by some locals at the beach. He is taken to a hospital.<br /><br />When the word gets out about his rescue, the shipping company which owned the vessel which sunk sent their agents to get details of how the ship's disaster. This was serious business because it involved insurance claims and the like. It was unusually for a ship of that size to sink even in the most violent seas.<br /><br />Usually ships are built in such a way that they cansurvive the most violent waves, even waves which might ride over the entire vessel. Ships are built to be sealed. In a storm, the captain instructs the crew to seal all entrances, even the port holes and air duck vents. Even if waves climb over the hull of the ship, even if the ship goes under a massive wave, the ship will still emerge above water soon after, just as a sealed empty tin can will float back to the surface no matter what.<br /><br />Here however if you saw the film, you may recall that during the story, when the hero of the story left a cabin below in the ship and came to view the storm, he had left a door ajar. He was an inexperienced teenager. Perhaps that one act was the cause of the ship going down, because when he went back into the ship to find his parents, who were sleeping when he first left, the bottom of the ship was filled with sea water.<br /><br />In any case, shipping agents came from Japan to speak to him about the cause of the ship going down. He began by telling them what happened as far as he could remember. These agents became very impatient with him because he discussed the cannibal floating island, the fluorescent creatures, the life and death of the zebra, orangutan and hyena.<br /><br />This was too much for them. One of them instructed him to get on with the real story. This was the real story but it did not fit into the scheme of regular events. They pressured him to speak truthfully.<br /><br />He eventually relented and told them a different story about the wreck but one which aligned itself with our normal physical reality.<br /><br />===============<br /><br />This is the transcendental future of this movie, that we spend out entire lifetime denying anything which is not mere physical reality. Usually we only accept perceptions which make sense within the present cultural framework. We do this to such an extent that any experiences outside of that range are denied or are altered to match physical reality.<br /><br />Why do we do this? How is this happening?<br /><br />After all is said and done what is standard for one culture may be taboo in another situation, so why do we always rewrite the story to match the materialistic culture.<br /><br />Even if the cannibal island and the florescent sea creatures were seen through hallucinations of the hero still that does not mean that such events were not part of another level of existence, another reality. Hallucination does not necessarily mean the perception of something imagined. It could mean the perception of something in another time, place or dimension.<br /><br />It is something to consider how out minds refute anything which is not the flat linear event of this physical reality.<br /><br />===========<br />Special Note:<br /><br />I did a translation and commentary of the book [[ASIN:0984001336 Markandeya Samasya English]] which is part of the Mahabharata. This commentary was done under the title of [[ASIN:0984001328 Krishna Cosmic Body]]. You may want to take a look at that book, since there the great yogi, Markandeya, was thrashed about in a cosmic flood. He entered into Krishna's mouth and found the universe within it. He toured about in Krishna's body for millions of years, and then he was coughed out.survive the most violent waves, even waves which might ride over the entire vessel. Ships are built to be sealed.

1401311091|5.0|I love anything &#34;Castle&#34; - hard not to picture the TV characters when reading, though.  Sure wish I knew who the real author is - my bet is on Grisham.
B00062PN6I|1.0|For $14.99, I wasn't expecting much, but they broke 3 months after I received them.  The speaker on the right stopped working.  They were relatively comfortable, very light and the sound was somewhat better than what I expected but they should have lasted longer than 3 months.  I primarily used them with my iPad.  I was disappointed because I was otherwise happy with them.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|when I first got this I dident know how to play but when it showed me the instructions I got the hang of it I cant belive it was free
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We all love this movie!  Very funny for both kids and adults. Couldnt wait for it to come out so we could buy it!
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|I think this was a quite fitting end to this storyline.  I had a few issues with it, but overall great story. Zombie President Reagan was an interesting choice.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is amazing. It never stops its like Mario going from place to place. I absolutely love this game.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|I'm a fan of historical fiction. But it isn't often I find a writer that propels me into the past then captures the essence of a time period, let alone an era of horrendous intolerance, the way Christoph Fischer does in The Luck of the Weissensteiners. And the telling of it is heartbreaking.<br /><br />Fischer begins his story in Bratislava in the 1930s where we find serious Greta Weissensteiner, the daughter of a Jewish weaver, falling for the bookseller, Wilhelm Winkelmeier. As we all know this isn't a particularly great time in history for couples with such diverse backgrounds to fall in love, especially with the hatred and mistrust on the horizon. But Fischer pulls you along and soon you're caught up in the powerful characters. So much so, that you feel their enduring love, their disappointments, and the distrust and betrayal as it begins to build and play out, a signal of the political climate that will only get worse.<br /><br />Greta and Wilhelm didn't just grab me, they held on for life and wouldn't let go, or should I say their survival of the human spirit did, a compelling combination.<br /><br />I assure you The Luck of the Weissensteiners will NOT leave my Kindle. It will be reread again and again and enjoyed for years to come.
B0083WLKBA|3.0|Disappointed because the DVD had skips in it.  I did not get the value that I put into it.<br /><br />.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|Watch out for a few scary parts for the younger viewers--when Dad vampire gets angry he growls and his eyes turn red, but other that it's good times!
B009HV2JT8|1.0|As I started watching this movie, I only watched 5 minutes of the movie and could not finish watching....I love vampire movies but this was not made well...in my opinion....<br /><br />Why did Hollywood lose their taste in movies that they want to make....they seem to have lost themselves turning every movie into a horror or thriller movie....Come on Hollywood make some decent movies. They are using fairytale stories and making them also as dark as they can and that is not what was expected of the movies. They can't even make a movie that is appropriate for a preschooler, every movie that I have tried to take my daughter to I have walked out of...We do not even go to the theater anymore. We watch certain movies on Netflix so that they can be appropriate for her.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|WOW temple run two is way better than then the first version. I'm so pleased by the graphics and I realy think the vines are a good addition. So I think anyone should get this app!

0062238868|5.0|A really, really great read about something that has usually remained in the dark. His expertise, training, and missions were incredible and it was fascinating to read.<br /><br />Today it was on the news that Chris Kyle was shot by someone at a shooting range. May he rest in peace.
B005PV81MS|1.0|Bratty kids who sound just like nanny-state liberal moviemakers while they commit crimes against women and animals are interesting to some. If the script was made exactly the same but the story was set in America the same folks who are bashing American movies in these reviews would hate it. I love all kinds of weird and cheap movies like Bubba Ho-Tep, Six String Samurai and Repo Man, but this was soulless and dull.
B00A3YTC6Q|5.0|This was one of the best Step Up movies that they made...I loved the dance scenes especially the last dance scene of the movie which had people dressed up as police officer's and other people dancing up and down the walls...Totally amazing movie!

B007VYQ9G2|2.0|OK movie, way over-priced.....rental is better. Didn't like having to buy BOTH the DVD and Blu-Ray disc. Probably won't watch it twice.
B00A2H9LK6|2.0|[[ASIN:B000I8HIR2 Silent Hill]] was original when it was first released. Sinister and nightmarish all the way through but held a story that you wanted to follow to the end.<br /><br />This second instalment has little of what made the first good. It has some good settings but these are just a spill over form the original. Then it has a few cheap scares but never does it become sinister or really suspenseful. The main problem is that there is hardly any story to back it up and what there is so so much less than before.<br /><br />Admittedly I watched it in 2D at home, but I don't think that 3D would have done much for the story.<br /><br />Overall it adds almost nothing to the original and is very little rewarding to watch. You might as well give it a miss.

0061743526|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee, is a classic set in the hard times of the Great Depression. While reading this book, you get a real sense of what life was like during that time of hardship and racism. I liked how this book gave a wonderful view of a young girl growing up, and trying to understand this big world around her.<br /> Scout Finch is being raised by her father, Atticus, along with her older brother Jem. Scout is very much a tomboy, who would rather run and fight with the boys, instead of grow up to be a proper lady. When Atticus, who is a lawyer, is put in charge of handling a case for a black man, that's when the racial trials start. Scout and Jem watch as their father defends the innocent black man, even though it risks his friendships, respect around the town, and even his children's safety. Through this book, you will see an honest father, trying to raise two young children in a time of great issues.<br /> Young Scout starts to understand the troubles in this world, but also the good in it. She sees bad people who like to manipulate, and put down others; she also sees people like her father, who are honest, and truly kindhearted. By the time the book ends, Scout has seen a lot in her young life, and through her family, friends, and her sense of humor, she starts to learn how to handle any situation, as well as be a young lady, which will set her up well for her adult life.<br /> Overall, this is a wonderful story. You will love certain characters, and dislike others, but you will always enjoy Scout and all her opinions. This book gives you a good view into the everyday life of a child growing up in that era.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so very addictive whenever I get bored it's all I do and now that I know you can compete with Facebook friends, it's on, I'm gonna be the best
B000H2R71G|5.0|The first time I saw the &#34;Road Warrior&#34; was in the mid 80's when I was a teenager. I loved it then, I still love it today a hundred or so times later. The chase scenes, the old 70's muscle cars set across an apocalyptic background with the daily war being waged on fuel. A genious plot to be derived from the original &#34;Mad Max&#34; and as being told be from an older &#34;Feral Child&#34; character. 5 stars!
1455519650|3.0|I was steered to Michael Connelly by one of my favorite English professors from UT Austin, whose judgment regarding good writing is gold. I was not disappointed. I was already leaning toward the crime fiction genre as a source of good stories after reading &#34;One for the Books&#34; by Joe Queenan, whose omnivorous taste in books includes a wide array of crime fiction writers from around the world. Connelly stands out as a cool, clean writer who doesn't mess around, has a knack for good plotting, and, with Hieronymous &#34;Harry&#34; Bosch, has created a protagonist who can carry a series through many adventures. In fact, &#34;The Black Ice&#34; is the first of a long line of Harry Bosch mysteries. I look forward to reading many more and actually have two in my &#34;ready & waiting&#34; stack right now. I like this guy because he's tough, smart, and a loner. Bosch is Jim Rockford without the humor and sidekick. And he lives in L.A., one of the great and most mysterious cities of all. I enjoyed following him around the city as he unraveled a bank robbery and murder that was oddly entangled with his days as a tunnel rat in Vietnam. With a little starstruck love on the side to spice things up. Will we see her again? I don't know. But I'll be seeing both Connelly and Bosch in future episodes.

0811875555|5.0|Tangled has become one of my all-time favorite movies. I've always loved Disney, and I've fallen in love with this film. This book is so beautiful, as is all the artwork and concept sketches included. Glen Keane's sketches are wonderful, and the different paintings from various artists are so detailed and full of color. Each page is so gorgeous. I love reading about all the Disney and fairy tale history behind the movie as well as all the influences to its style. This book is lovely, and I highly recommend it to anyone.

This book is great for women who have a bad past it makes you realize how much more stronger you are then you think. It gives you hope I would recommend this to anyone who falls in love with the characters and willingly attaches her/his self wanting more! This book does exactly that! I only wish that in end he finished it with explaining she went to her new family and marries but yet again it ends beautifully leaving you with a smile on your face!

B005F9TQ9C|5.0|A lot of people don't like this album and I think it is because it strays too far from his normal offerings. But what is normal for Bob Dylan? I enjoy the mood he sets and the historical references (Copper Kettle, Days of 49). He sings songs that he liked and turns out they are songs that I also like (Blue Moon, Gotta Travel On).

B008NR90HQ|1.0|I bought 11 DVDs on ebay at the same time as I bought these. They only cost $20 for 11 and arrived before Xmas. These took 7 seven weeks longer to arrive and each DVD cost $20.- so expensive for such bad service.  I will never shop amazon again
B005779X4U|5.0|If you have a stainless kitchen, and you're looking for a quality, covered trash can, this is a great choice.  The recycling hopper makes it easy to be a good human, and like another reviewer has said, you can always flip sides and use the big side for recycling and the small side for waste if your needs warrant it.<br /><br />The lid is amazing.  The slow-close is such a welcome addition after almost two years of the slamming lid our previous can had.  And the step is quite a piece of engineering itself; our can sits around a stub wall in our tiny kitchen, technically in the dining nook, we almost always step on the right-side of the step and the can takes the abuse in stride.  With our previous Big-Box no-name cheap stainless can, you could almost feel the stress you were putting on the pedal and linkage when you didn't step just right on it.<br /><br />Another perk over our previous can is that all the linkage and hardware is INSIDE the can.  The old one had a plastic bubble/blister/eyesore behind the lid that housed the hinge and lift assembly.  With the simplehuman its all inside, concealed, protected, and awesome.  The can sits perfectly flush with the wall (save for about 1-1.5&#34; of clearance to keep the lid from banging the wall when opened quickly) and looks great doing it.<br /><br />My wife balked at the price, but after we saw one in person at a local store, then she saw the Recycler model, she was sold as well.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This a a truly amazing movie.  It has Action, Love, Tragedy, and a little humor.  Inspirational!<br />And it will make you cry...
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Challenging and fun! Keeps me focused and I intrigued to go finish the game. I love these types of challenging games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Woah. This game kind of stinks on ipod and iphone, but on kindle it is pretty awesome. I have this game also for Pc and XBOX, and it is a little better on those,but on the xbox you can't move the worlds other places to show other people (such as another persons xbox),and on Pc you can only do it with a very complicated sequence. this, however, is a whole different story! And, once you get used to it, the building is very easy.
1423140605|5.0|We are delighted with the Rick Riordon tales of Jason Grace and Percy Jackson.  This book takes the tale up a notch.  As the characters mature and wander through their teens, the story is also maturing. This series is great for young tweens-teens, since they can \\"move up\\" through the series as they grow older.  The parallels between characters of other quest stories are there, but age-appropriate and less complex than a Harry Potter-type series.<br /><br />What is especially nice about the books in this second cluster, is that it draws the compare/contrast of the Greek and Roman Gods which are currently being taught in his world & ancient history classes.  It has educational value because of the more complex reasoning required to see how different gods/goddesses changed their personalities when the Greeks were conquered by the Romans, and more humanized.  Who would have thought that could be captured in such a fun adventure tale?<br /><br />The female/girl characters play against type as fighters, yet still maintain the feminine characters.  The boys are allowed to be weak sometimes, and all of the characters feel like outsiders (as do real teens/tweens).<br /><br />A great pleasure is that all demigods in the book have ADHD and have dyslexia, like my son.  They have dyslexia because they only read ancient Greek.  This creates the first childrens' book characters I've ever read where the heroic characters are brilliant, brave, and loyal with the learning disabilities my son struggles with daily. Often I remind him that \\"if the heroes of Olympus can succeed, so can you\\", and it usually gives him a second wind.<br /><br />The only disadvantage?  We have to WAIT until the next book is published.  Hurry Rick, hurry! We have an idea that Leo is leading the charge...
B0049PNOS2|1.0|I bought 11 DVDs on ebay at the same time as I bought these. They only cost $20 for 11 and arrived before Xmas. These took 7 seven weeks longer to arrive and each DVD cost $20.- so expensive for such bad service.  I will never shop amazon again
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is just one of those books you don't want to end.  It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  My only regret was not reading it in the summer when I was on vacation relaxing on the beach.  What are you waiting on...get the book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the moment I started this I couldn't put it down, great book! I definitely recommended this book to anyone who wants a book to grab their attention
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|After the horrors and suspense of AHS Season 1 I didn't know how they would follow up with season 2. The ghosts of the murder house was an amazing idea....nothing could top that. Except, perhaps an insane asylum....<br /><br />Some of it is cliche (mad doctor doing horrible experiments on the forgotten crazy person, the pious, judgmental nun, etc.), some of it just plain weird (an alien abduction?). There are some familiar faces but the characters are completely different.<br /><br />It's definitely entertaining but not perfect and often times confusing but once a week I can count on shuddering after the one hour creep fest and thank my stars that it's just  pretend.
B005UBNKWO|4.0|Fast and low temps over clocks well over all good product this is my eighth computer build using amd processors no problems
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app,  addicted right away. I have found lots of great recipes and seen incredible world wide pictures. This is useful and lots of fun too.
B008220BLG|5.0|Warm Bodies is a funny and charming, sweet and touching story about a lonely Zombie named \\"R\\", who wants a little more out of his undead life.  He just wants to connect with someone.  What I loved about this movie is that it does not take itself seriously even though it points out that we are all Zombies living in our own little boxes constantly talking on our cell phones and not paying attention to those around us.<br /><br />Along with the sweet and endearing, there is an equal amount of humor. Adapted from the beautifully written and poignant novel by Isaac Marion, Warm Bodies has something for everyone. I really enjoyed this movie and saw it on Friday and again on Sunday, I loved it that much. It's a little bit Shaun of the Dead meets Romeo and Juliet.<br /><br />\\"R\\" (the adorable and talented Nicholas Hoult) along with his best friend and fellow Zombie \\"M\\" (funny man Rob Corddry) embark on a hunting trip to the city with their other undead brethren, where R kills a man named Perry (Dave Franco), consumes his brain and experiences his memories and sees and instantly falls for his victim's girlfriend Julie(Teresa Palmer).  He saves Julie's life, takes her back to his lair, an airplane in an abandoned airport.  They form an uneasy friendship that becomes something more and his connection to Julie sparks a change in R that just might be key to saving the world.<br /><br />Not only was it fun and entertaining, but there is a clear lesson to be learned from R.  It's better to live than to merely survive.  Warm Bodies is a fantastic movie and I can't recommend it enough.
075669812X|5.0|My son wanted the Green Ninja and there was no way I was going to pay nearly $30 for the character nor was I going to drop $100+ on the set that includes him.  Coming across this book was perfect.  It is affordable AND it included the character my son wanted.  He was even more excited about the fact that the character is the &#34;newer&#34; outfit.  For the character, alone, the price of the book is a steal.  But character aside, the book is excellent.  It is much like the other Lego encyclopedias my son already has.  He spends a good deal of time looking at the pictures and reading the information about the Ninjago characters and is always eager to share with us some new fact that he learns.  So, hard-to-find Green Ninja + great book + very reasonable price = 5 Stars and a very happy son (and parent).
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I love everything about this game - the art, the play the music.  Austin Wintory wrote the music and he was nominated for a Grammy for it!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Fun.....but lost all of our coins for no reason after playing for about a week.  Maddening.  Was a waste of time if you can't upgrade or buy stuff.
B00AWTSRZY|3.0|Good action but there were some odd characters at times. Some were oddly drawn, very hardcare for DC at times.
B004DHUAZQ|1.0|Waste of time for me. Very disappointed, primitive story, almost no acting, dialogs on 4 year old level killed all efforts by the crew. Stalone worst of all. Well, that is just mine opinion.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I don't know what happened, but after I died one game, it would not let me back in the game. I loved the game so that was sad. I think I am going to stick with the old one until this fixes.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Turned up as a virus on my kindle. Antivirus software declared it a threat so I did. Better off going to youtube.com.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Very good book.  One of my favorite authors.  I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|This was an outstanding heartwarming movie. Will bring a tear to your eye with a little erotica added for good measure!
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King cannot be beaten when it comes to building his characters. I come away every time imagining that I have known them for a very long time. This book is excellent and has a fantastic surprise ending.
0790734591|5.0|I like Bruce Willis and usually buy any Movie that he stars in. This is a good movie to watch over and over, Bruce does it great.
0552555592|5.0|This is a sequel to &#34;The Wee Free Men,&#34; a story about the young witch Tiffany Aching.  It's a well written story (of course, if you're familiar with the works of Terry Pratchett) and I like the character.  And it has the Nac Mac Feagle, of course, always a plus.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|My son and I had a lot of fun playing this. Not a super long game but fun for the few hours it took to beat it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Should be required watching in school.  If everyone knew more about their food perhaps their food choices would be wiser.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is back to writing exciting, riveting stories.<br /><br />Long time Grisham fans will be very glad to open and read this one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another great book from Colleen Hoover! I have loved her two other books and this one was no different! Unexpected turns to story that give you depth to the relationship:) loved it!
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Great movie...! Highly recomended.<br />Thought guidance is advised when watching it with teen agers..<br />It will help if you read the book first
1616550414|5.0|is the best thing i have ever bought of TLOZ, excellent quality, and beautiful in every page.<br /><br />the best buy ever
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|This movie is fun, but definetily not a family movie.<br /><br />Sometimes it feels like the author did too much trying to make you laugh. And those times make the worst scenes of the movie.<br /><br />I recommend this movie if you want to laugh a bit but don't expect too much from it.
B001UJIMN2|5.0|This is a wonderful album with great sound and mixing, overall very fun to listen to. Each member plays amazingly. This is a classic Chili Peppers album.
0060935464|3.0|Enjoyed the book, but prefer the movie. Gregory Peck in glasses and a life sized vegetable what more do you want. Perhaps a frenzied dog and a hot summer.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The music is sensational! It brings me back to the actually movie. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys musicals.
B008OOYALE|5.0|You can gift gold to your neighbors, your dragons don't become sick if left unattended nor do your crops wither, and you don't have to wait a certain time amount when you collect from your dragons you can just collect whenever! I wish the other TeamLava games were more similar to this one. 2 thumbs up from me!
B004QX07G4|3.0|I'm willing to bet Ellen has written better books than this one, but since Ellen is thinking aloud, and I happen to enjoy her banter, I can forgive having given the time to read this particular book of hers.  I'm sure she has written better books with more reason to want to glue oneself to the pages than this one.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|great story for adults and kiddos especially for halloween! It a cute tale of love and  life with great comedy and actors
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I think the movie was way too long, almost boring, it also has too much valiance! I wouldn't recomend it.
B004WR125O|5.0|Works fine with little technical know-how required.  Just wish if this was Onkyo's Wifi solution they had provided a second USB input.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|This was a fabulous movie and I'm so glad that the soundtrack it just as good!  :)  :)  :)  :)
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am a Song of Ice and Fire fan through and through, and A Storm of Swords was probably my favorite up to this point (I have read up to book five). The jaw dropping moments that hit you out of nowhere are just amazing - and I mean that literally - I don't think any other book has actually had me gasping out loud at what I just read!<br /><br />A nice aspect of this book specifically is that we are able to delve into the minds of some of the characters we have known since the beginning. but haven't actually heard from before. I found that my opinions about certain characters changed once I was able to see things from their point of view. For me this is what sets this series apart from others - I've never cared so much about a character in a book, let alone so many different characters, before A Song of Ice and Fire.<br /><br />The books in A Song of Ice and Fire are the kind of books that I don't want to read because I don't want them to end. That is a rare thing indeed - and a good problem to have!
0783225849|4.0|I liked it.  We saw &#34;Hitchcock&#34;, which was about the making of &#34;Psycho&#34;.  What a great way to celebrate the New Year.  I remember seeing &#34;Psycho&#34; when it first came out.  It was still just as scary.  Still have trouble taking a shower.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just like to see what looks good. Some very crafty ideas and some gôod style and most of all lots of goodnlooking food
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I wasn't expecting the ending at all. Very suspenseful. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the most engaging series I have ever watched.  It takes for granted that the audience has an education and enjoys learning about another era.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I saw this with my 7 year old son. We both teared up at certain parts. It was a good bonding movie for us.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I'm guessing that pretty much everyone reading the Song of Ice and Fire Series who has gotten this far doesn't really need any convincing to continue on at this point. Plain and simple - if you have already read the first three than what are you waiting for? Buy this book!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I missed this episode when it came on tv so I had to rent it. It was worth it. I'm very tempted to buy the whole third season.
B007N0REX6|5.0|If you are a metal fan and like Slash you will love this CD.  It is absolutley vintage Slash.  He and Myles Kennedy are a \\"metal-marriage\\" made in heaven...there simply is not a bad song on thid cd. You can just hear Slash just ripping his guitar song after song, and Myles Kennedy showing off some of the best vocal range I'v heard since Rob Halford.  It is a rare thing for me to like any CD from the first song to the last...this one does.  I can only hope that Slash and Myles can hang around and do a few more cd's and tours together.  Metal Heaven.
030758836X|2.0|This book just missed me entirely. Good writing saves it from being a one star assault on credibility. I did not like any of the characters and the plot has gone too far to deserve any serious consideration. It is fiction, but I would like to able to consider some of the action possible. Not happening with this book, it builds for 300 pages and then both the author and I were looking for an exit.In the movie 'The War of the Roses'. there was conclusion of some satisfaction, this book made me feel as if the last pages had been torn out. If disturbing was the emotion Ms Flynn is attempting to convey, she has succeeded with me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a very well done production showing what upper class living was like prior to World War II.  It involves the family life of the family living at the manor as well as the lives of the servant staff at the manor and the interaction between them.
1616550414|5.0|What can I say? For a mere 25 bucks, I got a full, professionally made compedium of interesting knowledge and facts of the Zelda Universe. The majority of it, I'll admit, I already knew; but it was still nice to fill in the lingering details that were left unsaid inbetween the games.<br />The official Zelda timeline, seems sort of a cop-out with regards to the 'Hero fails' timeline. I can understand the timeline split between the Hero returns and the Hero leaves. But the third one seems tacked on and doesn't make sense why the hero would fail right then at that critical juncture, he could fail at any game on the timeline and a new one world would be split from there.<br />Regardless, the artwork is fantastic and I like how they go chronologically through the games and explain the reasoning or basis for various designs for each of the characters. The final comic at the end is a nice bonus and a great way to endcap the book. Even though there was a bit too much Skyward Sword and not enough of some of the other games, its still a great tome and deserves to be in the library of many a Zelda fan.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|King at his best. If you don't like his horror books, this mystery is great! Keeps you wanting more at the end of each chapter.
B008D28HYS|4.0|This has been a favorite, bordering on addictive since I installed it on my phone. It plays well on my Kindle Fire also.<br /><br />I have never witnessed any major bugs in the app, which is something not often encountered nowadays. I would highly recommend for fans of Sudoku and similar games.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John is a very good story teller and this book was no exception. A great read. I finished it in two days.
B004I744AS|5.0|I am always looking up words. For free! I love this app. Haven't had any problems! Always comes up quickly.  Well worth it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoy the game and the little changes of detail and setting, but the pop up ads are a bother.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book, loved this movie, loved the soundtrack.  Kept my attention the whole time and it was a good read.
1401937519|5.0|Really made a lot of sense of what comes after we leave the this planet. A life changer for sure!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This game has almost been an addiction for me. Coded very well - I've never encountered a serious bug. The main re-occurring issue I've seen is occasions where the numbers will not be marked out when you have indeed allocated them (And this is not when there was a fat-fingering on the user's part).<br /><br />Further, just about the time you begin to run out of puzzles, the author sends an update for this and CrossMe Color to add even more puzzles to the lower-levels.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game, super fun and addicting! I love how you can get new people and hoverboards. The new update, where they take you to Rio, is cool, and I really like how they are going around the world. Get this game!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Addictive game. I played for hours at a time. It is challenging and funny. Each level brought something new. It is worth spending the time to beat the game to see the end! :)
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I struggle with keeping the conversation going and this book had some good helpful hints. I liked it and would recommend it.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I was hoping for the cheaper price, that it would charge my Kindle. But, it does not work on the kindle. Just bite the bullet and spend the extra cash on the more expensive, made from Kindle, charger.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Really easy to use and connect to my ps3 and watch all the movies in the internet in U-tube or your tablet still have to discover more about of this app but so far really happy with it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Crashed my Kindle Fire multiple times, especially when using the 'gems'. Customer service was great at resolving the issue, but it is uninstalled and will remain that way.  Pity, its as fun as the original.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|my son really likes the characters and i think its kinda fun myself. i do think having to keeo tabbing back takes aay from it though
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is unbelievably fun. I love to play it when I have time. I really reccomend it. I hope you have fun with this game
160059672X|5.0|Beautiful book!!! I love the feel of the cover.  The book contains information on how to get starte with bead embroidery.  However if your looking for a book<br />that shows patterns with exact placement of your beads, this book does not offer that, the author leaves that up to the creator of the project.  There are instructions with materials listings for the projects in the book along with some shape templates;
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Like I said love all of Nicholas Sparks reading. Give my friends his writing!Pass all his works to my friends!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really fun to play and I think much better than the Temple Run 1. I can spend lots of time playing it.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|This was purchased for an 11-yr-old -- I was feeling wistful and reminiscing on some of the movies I'd watched in my childhood and decided to expose my children to some of them -- good, clean fun in this movie, and the kids (aged 3-11) burst out laughing on more than one occasion. Definitely an enjoyable experience for our family.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|it is a very boring game, extremely boring game not much to it and like i said it is a boring game
B004HO6I4W|5.0|I love everything about this movie from the colors to the music to the characters, It was all about adventure and trust - a great combination along with a sweet love story with humans and birds. Very energetic movie!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son says it keeps his interest. And he enjoys not having to find a Wi-Fi connection to use his Kindle Fire. These are great for travel in the car.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I have read quite a few novels about Agent Pendergast and they keep gettting better and better.  This was one of the books.
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|I tbroughly enjoyed this movie-but I have also loved most Cronenburg films.  He has a distinct approach to his work, and I can appreciate it's not to everyone's taste.  On top of that, the film is based on, and incorporates dialogue from a pretty dense and hard to follow novel.  But it is a very different movie, and I mean that in the best sense of the word.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another great story by Grisham.  Starts out a little slow, but has the typical Grisham twists and turns that keep you wanting more.  Would make a great movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very awesome but wierd sometime.it's funny and fun to play. I love the game very much.I love Tony and I want to get the Rio special person I loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love the new Disney movies and was not sure how I would like this one. I was happily surprised at this movie and love the independent Princess! She is great and will be one of the movies I will watch often.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was not as good as exspected.<br /><br />I choose it because of the author.<br /><br /> I would not recommend it unless they were just looking for something easy to read..
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I remember the original one from the 80's. Although basically the same story both are wonderful in their own way!!!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Almost everytime I use a save me it freezes the screen and sends me to the freaking home page. The few times it does let me, it still exits out, but then it takes all the jems I used and doesn't take all the meters I ran. WHOEVEF MADE THIS GAME NEEDS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM ASAP!!!!!!!!
B0007M8HTW|5.0|i love miles davis's playing and if you in to jazz you will love this cd. get it to day!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I enjoyed the book. But the last few chapters, too much happened too fast. Lots of new names introduced at the last minute, I had a hard time keeping track of all the new characters.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the whole book series and was very skeptical about not only the cast, but the adaptation of the book. I was stunned how good the movie was and the great characters. Lenny Kravitz surprised me by playing a spectacular Cinna! Definitely one that I will watch for a long time!
1419705849|5.0|Our 10 year old granddaughter loves these books and said that this is one of the best.  We pre-ordered so she could be one of the 1st to have it.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|This could  easily d be the first Jack Teacher book. Another very good read.  This one keeps it interesting and takes place just before book one'
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ever since I got my kindle fire I have not found a game like Subway Surfer. The content of this game is quite simple but fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't know exactly how I got a season pass, as I was buying one episode at a time.  I wanted to watch one episode per week, but I could not resist watching the whole season.  I am looking forward to next season!  This is a show that one can get totally lost in.  There really isn't any predicting on where the show will take you next.  Season 3 was filled with tears of joy and of sadness.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Complex and lush plot.  Understated yet colorful presentation makes this a wonderful series showing the caste system of England as it decayed at the beginning of the 20th Century.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I watched this twice at the movies and several times on DVD. This is a great series and how can you not love it. Team Edward all the way!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is super fun! for all you horse lovers, this is definitely a game for you!!! at first I thought it was not going to be that much fun but as you get more and more into the game its really fun!!!
B000HWZ4CA|4.0|Viewed this movie a while ago and it was great movie back then and it is a great movie now.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a great read! Crazy love! My time reading from this author. Going to read a another one of her books in hopes it can be at least half as good as this one!
B006YC74E8|3.0|Tried this app on my tablet. never worked properly. tried to change settings to get it to work. never could get it to function as advertised. Uninstalled. May work on your device
B0087ITBPC|1.0|sorry but after seeing interviews with streisand about this movie and her big as the ocean ego ('why wont anyone work with me' she wonders) but after listening to 15 min of commentary on 'star is born' where its all about me me me me me streisand has ruined any enjoyment i would have for a movie shes in. this movie stayed one week where i'm at and then vanished....kinda like that latter part of her 'career'. i'm sure that there r her fans that will love this but for me 'no'
B004PR71JC|5.0|I love the movie and the music was so energetic. I listen to the CD all of the time and never get tired of the songs!
B00006AUIG|3.0|I found this quite highly recommended little horror watchable, but the ending somehow disappointed me. Below some more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />The good initial idea was to make a film about hard working blue collar people who make their living by removing asbestos from old buildings. This is a hard, dirty and dangerous work and they certainly deserve every penny they are paid for doing it. Their small team is made of five men: Gordon (the owner of the company and therefore the boss), Jeff (Gordon's young nephew, a rookie on his first job), Mike (a law school dropout), Hank (physically very strong and also kind of an a--hole) and finally Phil (Gordon's old pal, pretty depressed those last months). Other than David Caruso (who plays Phil) and Paul Guilfoyle (\\"CSI\\"), who makes a cameo in the beginning, I didn't know any actors, but they did as good a job, as the scenario alowed them.<br /><br />Gordon's company just won the bid for a big job - cleaning a very large, old and a little sinister building, which for many years served as a psychiatric hospital. I will say no more about the plot. The place they clean is indeed quite fascinating and really CREEPY, offering a lot of possibilities, but of which only some were used by the director. Which is a pity.<br /><br />During more than two-thirds of the film not much really happens, but surprisingly, this very long and slow 70 minutes were, at least for my personal taste, the best part of the film. Conversations between the five main characters, vision of this abandoned place where so much human misery poured into the walls and some little warnings, that something bad could possibly happen later - all that was quite watchable, and I would rate \\"Session 9\\" four stars, if the whole film could be like that.<br /><br />Sadly, the last 20 minutes, I didn't like much. OK, I must concede that the BIG TWIST was unexpected, but once I recovered from it, I didn't enjoy the final parts of the film too much. But, to be honest, this is only my personal, subjective impression. From what I read in other reviews, many people rather liked the ending.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a honest little horror/thriller, quite watchable, with a rather surprising ending, which viewers might like - or not. Maybe the best thing is to watch it and make up your own mind.much. But, to be honest, this is only my personal, subjective impression.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is good for any horse lover, my daughter uses this app and loves the interactions with the horse and is working on getting a unicorn for her stable. I have to help her with some competitions for the complexity and her age, makes it fun for me though since we can both share our victory and time together.
0525953728|5.0|I really love this book! I finished it in 2 days. Couldn't put it down after the 1st chapter. I highly recommend this book for those who want to know the true events of what happened to OBL as well as knowing what life is like in the military.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought my mom-in-law the Kindle Touch and included this item with the package I sent to her. This is a handy cord to have and easy to store when traveling.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved the book and i already ordered the next book in the series. Kind of reminds me of Edward and bella
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. It opens a new world for me! I can build a castle &amp; pretended it`s Hogwarts!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so cool and i have always wanted a horse and now I can see how are old man
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but the update come for apple so I'm wondering when the update will come for kindle fire
B005VPRG10|5.0|My kids (6 + 8) are new converts to the Star Wars movies. They are also huge fans of Lego, so the various Lego Star Wars sets are hands-down winners in our house. Lego sets have come a long way since my  youth, not only in terms of lots of custom pieces, but also with much clearer instructions and the pieces in numbered bags i.e. assembly in stages. My kids had no issues with this model; usually I just check in occasionally to see that all is going well.<br /><br />Once completed, hours of fun re-enacting space battles.
B007BZM30M|5.0|Love it - great song and easy to download. I love being able to download to the Cloud and accessing it anywhere!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I simply can't wait for every episode.  I'm normally a war movie, action flick, sci-fi guy, but I'm hooked on Downton Abbey.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|A different take from the original trilogy of Terminator films, does have a good cameo of &#34;Ahnold&#34; in it and gives props to the CGI industry.
B004XVMCMQ|4.0|This is worth watching with good friends and family. As a woman we need to remember always follow our heart
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. Of course Nicholas Sparks books are normally great anyway. I think it was well written and the story was good. Great read.  Can't wait for the movie!
1449415881|5.0|If you, or a loved one, work for a large corporation, then Dilbert is a must. This page-a-day is a regular Christmas gift that never disappoints. I've received one every year for about a decade (I think) and it never grows old. The latest corporate psychopathy is captured / skewered by Scott Adams' wit mercilessly. I assume he works somewhere in my office!
B005LAIISA|5.0|The Ice Age series gets better and better. I was surprised how good the 3rd version (Dawn of Dinosaurs) but was pleasantly surprised how good the 4th one turned out. Great characters as always and Diego found a girlfriend! Definitely a great addition to our collection.
B008N1V11U|4.0|Great game! Nice graphics and controls.  Sorry its over. Only complaint is that the vehicles (especially the batpod) were very difficult to control. Taking 1 star off for that. Definately worth the money!!
B002ZG98LO|4.0|Good finale to the three Predator movies, causes a viewer to think of &#34;what if&#34; scenarios while watching the movie. Pleasant guest appearance of a genre star.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I am so happy with my CD!!!! It is as exactly described in the description! Brand new, great quality, and it even came with a Sorcerer's Stone poster, which I love!!!! Thank you so much!!!!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I am using it on the Kindle Fire and haven't encountered any problems. I can search, bid, and all the thing I can on my computer.  love it!
B005BDZN62|5.0|Our granddaughter wanted this for her birthday and she has enjoyed it very much. She likes musicals and it's fun to see her enjoy it as we did when it first came out in the theaters.
1848507836|5.0|I had &#34;Dying to be Me&#34; sent to my daughter in California as she had asked me to find the hook.<br />Was received by her in good condition and it was a good price.
B005KB0SU6|5.0|Excellent! Zafon is an outstanding writer and this book is again a beautiful story that catches you from the beginning.
B00418NVLW|5.0|Lyre of Orpheus:  ethereal and uplifting<br />Abattoir blues:  funky and surreal<br /><br />I believe oh children was used I appropriately in the Harry potter films. I guess you have to have lost a child to fully understand this.  A very beautiful album
B004GJYR7I|5.0|This is such a fun movie! I really love the humor and wit along with the slapstick comedy. Katherine a Cary at thier best. An all time favorite.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is so fun just like the first one.It is so addicting I love it so much thanks imangu studios
B009NCM248|5.0|Another great product from Stone Sour. These guys keep progressing with their tallents and ambition.<br /><br />This album is another great addition.<br /><br />Recommend to anyone who enjoys new hard rock!<br /><br />Great job guys!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The first book is ok. The second it is hard to cope with the teenage thoughts of the girl. Also, The power and mystery of Grey is what really catches the women´s attention. In this second book,  once Grey surrenders , he looses all his enchantement . The emails continue and are impossible to cope with. I couldn´t read it to the end.
044654759X|5.0|This book is AMAZING I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. Brilliant! I highly recommend it as well as any other Nicholas Sparks Books.
B00021HBGS|5.0|Our grandson has a blast playing with these in the bath. As I said, &#34;Good clean Fun!&#34;. Makes tubby time, fun time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful series!!!  Perfect cast of characters!!!  Holds your interest &  you cannot wait to see the next episode!!! Love it!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I went into reading A Dance with Dragons with low expectations, based on the large amount of 3-star reviews. I feel this is one of the better novels of the series! Lots of Danerys, Jon Snow, and plenty of political intrigue, and several surprises. Book 6 should be explosive!
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|We got this movie from redbox on a Friday night for my 4 year old son who LOVES scooby doo and is slightly obsessed with monsters and zombies. On Saturday we had to go and buy it. He replayed the part with the tounge falling out of the corpse's mouth over and over. He was laughing so hard he was gurgling, and slamming his fist on the table repeatedly saying &#34;come on man, you're killing me&#34;.<br /><br />I can see that this movie doesn't fit the bill for all families depending the type of parenting that's done, but it fit right in at our house. The stop animation is amazing, and the humour has many layers.
0061339202|4.0|This book was a great read. It offers examples of people who live in the &#34;flow&#34; and are constantly living joyful lives. It can give you the tools and examples needed to try and make the same of your life. Great read.
B0000549B0|5.0|This movie is so much fun for all ages! It really has you laughing and cheering for more. I wish they would have made a sequil!
B003BWNC5E|4.0|For the price I really can't complain much. You should know what your getting into at $10 and its totally worth a little hassle. The case is really great looking and has a nice texture and the speed I'm getting through it is fantastic, I hit 40mb/s copying movies to it. It is not however good at dealing with any sort of abuse. I didn't like the fit on the usb plug so I pushed it down a little thinking it would just pop into place, not too hard just enough to bend a paperclip but the plug snapped off the pcb. I soldered it back on and covered most of it with some epoxy, its nice and solid now.<br /><br />tldr; if your careful its great, if not its easy to work on.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The first game of this type I have played.  Great graphics and hints were good when needed.  A good beginning game
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is a fun upgrade to the fist game.no glitches that I know of and is easy to play.I like how when you slide down it doesn't make you see the slide from the characters perspective anymore.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I've done some research for the best ratings and bought this.  It's just what I wanted and needed. I would recommend it to everyone who owns a Kindle Fire HD
B0060AY6FO|4.0|It was an entertaining book and kept you guessing.  It was a little wordy at times in explaining things instead of encompassing those things into the story.  Still, it's hard not to love any story that contains some of my favorite characters.
B0076OV7F0|5.0|I love Lana Del Rey's debut album Born to Die. I got it in the Target exclusive version of it. Her album is a masterpiece! My favorite songs are on her album Born to Die is, Born to Die, Video Games, Blue Jeans, Carmen, Summertime Sadness, This What Makes us Girls, National Anthem, & Lolita. This album rules!
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I order this movie for my daughter ... she absolutely loved this one, specially because it is about Flash Mobs and she has participated in several.  Besides, because I pre-ordered it, I had the very nice surprise that I paid less than what I expected!
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I received this product quickly. I live this show! It's hilarious! I can't wait for the second season to go on dvd.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|jump out of your seat moments<br />look forward to the next episode the moment one episode finishes<br />look forward to season
0307887960|5.0|I really enjoyed a lot of the concepts.  I do not need to lose a lot of weight so I did not follow it to the &#34;T&#34;. But I have a friend who did and it worked out GREAT for him.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy is just an excuse to talk about kinky sex. I do not see what all the fuss is about.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|its a fun game, but if you want to play for more than 10 minutes, you have to buy the game. dissapointing.
B008E374T0|4.0|&#34;Handwritten&#34; is just about perfect from The Gaslight Anthem, and feels like a good ending to a chapter in their careers. You really couldn't have asked for better. The deluxe edition, however - I wish I'd just gotten the regular. The three extra songs are good, don't get me wrong. &#34;Blue Dahlia&#34; is a nice afterthought, although clearly  a b-side as it doesn't have any place on the album, and the two cover songs are well-executed. But the three of them together don't really add anything to the album or enhance its value at all. I wish I'd purchased the regular version so that it could just end on &#34;National Anthem&#34; as it should.
B009FZFONO|1.0|What happened to the great screenplay of previous seasons? Characters were extreme but very convincing, the outcome of certain situations left you astonished but it was still coherent and believable.  This season added awful characters/actors and the milestones are poorly directed. Some scenes like the raid on the military outpost are outright dumb. SMALL SPOILER AHEAD:  Here's a group of tough military trained men who seem to keep their protein intake during a zombie outbreak judging by their physique, BUT are stupid enough to be PWNED by an small armed militia......  I was really disappointed.
B005721W9O|5.0|Good Spoof on the Star Trek convention types.  Each cast member plays their role to a T.  Every SCI-FI film seems to have a crewman #6.<br /><br />Good way to spend a couple of hours away from the realities of day to day living.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Die Trying (Jack Reacher, No. 2) holds your attention for every moment, you are right there with them. Great read.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|While we laughed a couple of times, it's hard to understand how this was classified as a comedy. Not what we expected, meant we didn't enjoy as much.
B005LAII80|4.0|I enjoyed Judge Dredd of the 90's and have been waiting to see this.  I enjoyed it.  The story was good, explosions were good, everything pretty good but 2 things bugged me.  First..Karl Urban.  He tried to copy Sly's frown and it came across weird.  I mean, I know he's Dredd but something about that frown with the pooched lower lip was off to me.  He would have done better to have a normal expression rather than copy Sly, who has a funny sort of mouth to begin with.  It works for Sly but didn't work for Urban.  Second thing was the name \\"Maw-Maw\\".  When the name was said during the movie, not so smooth..just something a little off about it.  Other than those two very small things, the movie is good and if you liked Dredd in the 90's, I think you'll like and enjoy this too.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Pretty fun. A bit predictable, but entertaining. I recommend it if you like puzzle games. My husband even liked it. Cant wait to play the sequel.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I'm a Judy Dench fan. I think I have seen most of her movies and TV appearances..<br />The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel started out slow but the color and wonderful characters carried the movie to interesting situations.I thought Tom Wilkinson portrayed his character brilliantly with pathos and depth.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a real addicting game I play it alot you really have to think on how to use the birds given and what to use them on  my number 1 game on my phone and tablet thanks to invented this one  I love it!!!!!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Just downloaded the app. Have only used it for a little while. Love the store, makes it so easy to shop for ebooks. Books download fast & easy. So far my only complaint is the way the books are displayed. Do not like the display options at all.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game it is awsome.Keep it up maby you can make a other game I like. The dragons are hard to get and I spent all my gold on food for my dragons. But, all in all better game then I thought it would be.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|LOVED IT RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE THANK YOU SO MUCH AMAZON IS JUST GREAT SO GLAD I GOT TO USEYALL
B005NPCJ88|1.0|I love metal but American capitalist?  Go live in Cuba Pinkos!!!  Buy the way, I'm assuming that that these guys keep the money the earn and use it to enhance their lives - as they should...
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It was a lovely self sacrificing romance. I was sad he died.<br />The author did a very good job telling this warm and real
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Enjoyed the book so much was a relaxing kick back read that you could just get lost in you knew they loved each other it just took them time to realize it
1878424319|5.0|The agreement of not personalizing anything has changed my life significantly and the way that I process things now.  I will always be grateful for that wisdom! This book has always shed light for me on being integral with my word and the importance of doing so. Perfectly stated in being a practical guide to personal freedom!
B00APJLFEG|4.0|I rented for a birthday sleepover... kids really liked it!  Rental was easy and cheaper than renting from on demand.
B00APJLFEG|3.0|it wasn't funny had a little bit of a story line but in all it was just like a lot of other movies out there
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I read it expecting great things.  After all it's John Grisham!  I think he was taking a nap while he<br />was writing this book.  Great diappointment!
B007HACDLK|4.0|mostly quick paced, like the the same characters in the writers works Mitch Rap etc. Need more hero always wins novels. Since we can't find many in real life any more
B000F3T3CS|4.0|I have never seen a better performance of L'Elisir d'Amore.  The DVD itself leaves something to be desired.  The balance between the orchestra and the singers is unsatisfactory. The orchestra is too loud.
0345803493|4.0|All in all I enjoyed the trilogy.  The only downfall in my opinion was the over use of the descriptions in the sexual writings.  A little less of these would still have been more than enough.  It did have an unusual story line which I found compelling.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Entertaining never a dull moment. Never the same hand. Though I swear some hands are just unbeatable!!! :/ definitely lynch keeps me at the edge of my seat
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I tried to download it, it got to 12% then it stopped and now it wont let me uninstall it
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey is an arrogant egotist with a sarcastic approach to problems that I just love . My good fortune has allowed me to<br />work with a rare group of folks just like him.
0307887960|4.0|I like the book. It is an easy read. Dr. Dukan's passion for helping people to lose weight and manage their lifestyle is apparent. One just has to execute the plan.
B000SEIK2S|3.0|The writing is serviceable, the characters are thin at best, laughable at worst, the plot is interesting and the world-building is okay.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|great game needs some more maps but definately well done. love the large choice of heroes and skins available. great idea, not a lot of good games like this
B004SH40BQ|3.0|I purchased this device as a gift to use with a IPOD classic 80GB. The write up says it should work, but what i found is that this device only seems to work with newer IPOD classics. Best i can work out if your IPOD classic says it's most upto date software version is 1.1.2 (in ITunes), then this is an older IPOD classic and this device will not work (in fact not sure if any blue tooth device will work on these older IPOD classics - and at this point i'm not going to try), if you have a newer IPOD classic then your software version will be greater than 2.0 and this device will probably work. I gave it a three as i think it might work well and be a good product, but the write up on the web page needs changing to clarify what it will work with. If you plug in the device and a blue light does not come on then it is broken or will not work with the device it is connected to.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Where was the depth of the story? The book ended when the story just began... Not happy about that. The author could've at least had the decency to not make this into a series since most parts of the book was just fillers.....
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|good I have no more to say why are you asking me to write so much you guys suck bad
B00370J7E0|5.0|As we have tix for their concert 4-18-13 in Boston, we decided it was time to toss the scratched vinyl and noisy old cassette for a new CD!  It is a great album!  Nothing beats Tusk, or Sara, etc.  It is a different Mac album, especially after Rumours, but well worth the investment!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|this is a very good app and ai will recomended for any radio listeners make sure to download the full version
B006KP3XCQ|3.0|I wrote to the company saying I would keep the movie even though it was not the wide screen version advertised in the description on the website and in the flyer accompanying the disc. The box was crushed, but the disc was ok. There was a paper in with the disc that said it was a crushed disc and that it had been part of the info on the website. I admit that if it was, I missed it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Travis Maddox....yummy!<br /><br />I really love this book and how Travis just fell in love and on his knees! Highly recommend. A story you will never forget.
B008YI99IE|5.0|I loved all three of these movies and found the addition of Stegasauras, Spinosaurus and a pterodactyl (flying dino) great additions.
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is the best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I can't wait for the New book house of Hades it will be alsome
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun and challenging. lags on kindle fire sometimes or I would give it 5 stars. Graphics and physics are believable.
B008MM9630|5.0|nice game play. i thought it would be another laggy fb game but its not. totally enjoyable and entertaining. would love if the market stuff wasnt so expensive.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really liked the way the book was structured going from one characters perspective to the other characters perspective.  It was a great story with unexpected twists.  However, I was disappointed with the way it ended.
1568363842|5.0|Everyone who learns Japanese knows, how important is to familiarize with katakana and hiragana. This romanized version allows to learn kana step by step during learning new words and expressions
B003O86FMW|3.0|I was really interested to see where this story would go. It didn't keep my interest as well as the first book. A strange twist at the end. I guess I will have to read the last book to see how this all ends.
0596009208|5.0|It's a technical book but surprisingly easy to read, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning Java.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great games for someone with TBI. It helps my brain, short term memories. Keep playing and it gets better and better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is awesome and fun! They change the theme every once in a while and ever theme is awesome! There's always a person and a board u can get that goes along with the theme . Subway surfers is the best game ever!!!!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|The soundtrack of the movie is excellent<br />Versions of the songs are very good arrangement<br />Any fan of the 80 would enjoy this album
B005OCFGTO|5.0|The Harry Potter The Complete 8-Film DVD Collection were in perfect condition! I do not have any complaints at all!
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the books I have read by this author but this one was probably my favorite. It was a cute story with a lovable main character.  Very light, easy reading that makes you laugh out loud.  I liked that she was true to herself in the end. A very happy ending!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|3d effects were excellent, however we thought there could have been more action once they disovered the aliens. We normally like Charlize Theron, however she appeared to just be going through the motions and at one point we were thinking she might have also been a robot.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun. Fun. Fun. I love this game. Got my family playing it also. Time goes by so fast when your having fun
B007J4T2G8|2.0|would tolerate  being controllled for the sake of love.<br />I wasn't impressed or excited. I just read it to see what all the stupid  talk was all about and I'm puzzled by the women who think<br />that this type of crap is okay. Wake up women. Not in my wildest dreams.<br />And when they even mention this trilogy on talk shows all the stupid women  ohhh and ahh. Stupid!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft use the seed infinity it's awesome but minecraft is my favorite game I let my grandma play and she even loved it no joke
B00846REIS|5.0|One of my favorite series thus far.  Can't wait for the next one to come out so I can read more about Gideon Cross.  I'm soooo in love.
B00170I7GG|5.0|With Bill Murray being able to relive the same day over and over and over again, you get to see him become a man of incredible skill.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love It...this game is SOOOOOO freaking awesome. I want to play it everyday and I want to win everybody on the game.
B005OP2928|5.0|Really like this show. The cast is still on top of their game. Still entertaining me on a daily basis. Looking forward to more episodes
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love how it gives you ever word  in the whole world it is the best book ever<br /><br />By Tianna Doyle
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a YA book that won 2012 book of the year in its category. I truly loved this book and have recommended it to everyone I know. Read this--it's beautiful.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This item was exactly what we expected.  No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  This is a must have.
B008P76UKE|2.0|I own the CD of this work that I enjoy quite a bit, unfortunately the Blu-ray recording of this work is from a later period and really doesn't match the quality of the CD and that's very disappointing.  Yes, it's in surround, but the sonics just aren't there and the performance is definately below the performance of the CD.
B00B7G3NFU|3.0|It was a cute movie...I especially like when he talk to the preacher.  I think that's what made the movie worth watching.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This is such an amazing book, I read it in two days because I simply couldn't put it down! Simply amazing!
B0086700CM|4.0|A match 3 game which keeps me entertained for hours. Secret gems, bombs blowing up the board and easy to reach higher levels easily.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  Solid CD.  If you like the band then you'll like the CD..that simple.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Why do I feel it's the best. Because in this book Liz Solander finally gets a lot of attention. The first 2 books were very good, but had too many what I call sub-plots. Things that had nothing to do with Liz Solander. This was especially true in book 1. Half the book was pent tracking down Harriet Vanger. In book 2 there was a lot about Liz Solander. Police planning. The rogue spy group planning. But Liz Solander herself was not involved with these people.<br /><br />Back to book 3. Liz Solander was personally involved with virtually everyone mentioned. From her doctor to her lawyer. And almost everyone else.<br /><br />BTW. All 3 books of the trilogy have been made into films. They are in Swedish with English subtitles. Very good films. Gave them 4 stars. And since to keep the films from running 6 hours long, all this sub-plot stuff was eliminated or greatly abbreviated, Liz Solander got plenty of screen time. And she was perfectly cast.
B0050XFY4O|4.0|Overall a very satisfying movie, even if the subject matter will be unsettling to many. Miraculously manages to be a feel-good movie anyway.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Sooo much fun i love playing this and passing it around to see if anyone can beat some of the games
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|Sure it could be better but its still a good game. The controls with gyro are good and mostly smooth. Probably a little too easy of a game sometimes. I have not tried the joystick controls yet.
B000077VR3|5.0|This item was exactly what we expected.  No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  This is a must have.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|If you liked Something Borrowed, you must read this sequal.  You'll fall in love with Darcy and really enjoy her journey as she learns there is much more to life than parties and shopping.
B006H5120E|5.0|Everybody knows the movie. I will rate the blu-ray. This edition (3D+Blu-ray+Digital copy) is great. PQ is improved compared to the DVD version. The AQ is more vibrant. Really recomended for upgrading!
B000003MZU|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's by Juan Luis Guerra.  Bachata Rosa is such a romantic song to listen to with the one you love.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Great takes on classics. Very ELO, Lynnes' voice is spot on, a pity that this is his only new work in 20 years.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This item was exactly what we expected.  No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  This is a must have.
B005HS00P0|5.0|One of the best albums of the past few years.  This is a 2 LP set with beautiful inserts.  The quality of the master and the pressing is as excellent as the music.
B005HSL626|4.0|After playing for nearly a week, I found that it only took my grandson one ride home from school to beat my scores.  :(
0765325950|5.0|After waiting nearly 20 years for this book, I was pleasently suprised.  It is well written, and Mr. Sanderson did an excellent job of finishing Robert Jordans  epic.  It was worth the wait for the end of the story.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|My family enjoy this movie and have watched it several time already.  It is a good addition to our DVD Library.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|This item was exactly what we expected.  No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  This is a must have.
B0093BUWGE|5.0|Are you kidding?  This is the move for 2013.  Just completely for the grown folks that like real music.  Much love JJ
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts easy, but builds into a very challenging puzzle to solve.  Can't wait to get to other levels.  Love it.
B007712XAU|5.0|These discs arrived very well packaged, a few days before they were promised, and very reasonably priced.  I would recommend these to anyone who enjoys English productions.
B003TO5414|5.0|This DVD is for European DVD players I guess,  I have seen part of this series so I know that I really like it, but was disappointed that I have not been able to watch it.  It was sent from the UK so not sure what I should do with this DVD?
B008NW67E0|5.0|Every track is great. No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  Solid CD.  If you like the band then you'll like the CD..that simple.
0061353248|5.0|I'm currently a sophomore in College studying Business and had the opportunity to read six chapters of this book for a class called \\"Organizational Behavior\\". All I got to say is that I enjoyed every single page of it.<br /><br />Ariely teaches us on how to make better decisions in our ordinary day-to-day lives by breaking systematic patterns of thought. He conveys the reader with different ways, ideas and alternatives on how to fight the irrationality that everyone encounters. After reading it I can almost assure you that you'll start thinking twice about some particular actions you constantly make.<br /><br />Overall it's a great book, easy to read, humorous and definitely one of a kind. If you're interested in reading such type of book then \\"Predictably Irrational\\" is a MUST BUY for you. Thumbs up for Ariely!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a good book.I loved it!!ö.but I don't like when Rowley always gets the good luck and Greg doesn't.=-(
B00846REIS|5.0|Definitely better than FSOG. Well written, a page turner - did not want this book to end! Cannot wait until the next book in the series comes out to see what's going to happen to this couple. Sexy, sexnual and passionate.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Cinderella story, who would not like to see a life transformed.  This was a nice version of an old movie classic.  I liked it better than the original version.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|This item was exactly what we expected.  No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  This is a must have.
B007UWBQEU|4.0|We have enjoyed listening to Carrie since she won American Idol.  This CD does not disappoint.  The powerful Blown Away is one of those that even the hubby likes to crank up the radio.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read. It was romance, sweet. Not too much given away. I would give it 5 stars. It was GREAT!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Love the Crossfire series, and cannot wait to see what happens in the next book! Too bad we have to wait so long to see what happens! This is definitely a sexy read - I devoured Bared to You. While this is a good sequel, it doesn't compare to the first. Still, a great read. Thank you Sylvia Day, cannot wait for the next installment to see what happens!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have had many hours of fun with this application. If you enjoy a difficult game at some points and easier at others this game is for you!
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This item was exactly what we expected.  No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  This is a must have.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|i would recommend this movie to teen to mid twenty age group. it was entertaining and funny and the music was great
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was a new addition to games like Temple Run.Subway Surf is a fun twist on Temple Run a game everybody loves.This game is a different perspective on vandalism. When you first start you are a boy who gets caught by the police, when he runs is where you come in. It explains how to play, I must admit that it is much easier than Temple Run. The graphics are also much more colorful.I think this game would be great to introduce to a little one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun. I play it all the time. GET IT! Better than temple run. My little sister loves it.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie started out good about the first 30 seconds anyway.....So in the words of the star of the movie, it Sucked!!!!!
B000P0J09W|5.0|This item was exactly what we expected.  No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  This is a must have.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I lost about 15 pounds in a month when I did this 4-5 days a week and counting my calories! But then got lazy and gained all my weight back and then some :-(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just got my kindle fire for Christmas and I love playing Subway Surfers very fun game. I play it on a daily basis I would totally recommend this game.
B007712XAU|5.0|This was a birthday gift to our Daughter-in -law.....she said that the discs arrived in perfect condition, on time and the quality is very good.  She is very pleased, and I'm very happy with the purchase.
B00APJLX8E|5.0|Very entertaining and family safe. This movie is a fun time for the while family. The music and dance portions really get the kids going.
0767836324|5.0|This item was exactly what we expected.  No issues or problems and it arrived very quickly.  This is a must have.
B004ZN9J0K|5.0|When I was growing up a radio station came on that was the first FM Rock station in town. One of the albums that got a lot of play was this one and I got hooked on this album. I recently gave my original vinyl copy to a family member as a Christmas gift. But this is a great remaster and is as interesting as the original.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Basically it was the reason we subscribed to Amazon Prime Instant Video. :) Can not wait for the next season to start in about a week.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i would recomend this to anyone who likesa good series with an outstanding plot. sThe depiction of the English nobility is remarkable.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|every time I try to go on the app it takes me out so I keep on trying IT NEVER WORKS!!! So I have to enable it then re-download it its SOOOOOOOOO annoying!!!!!!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I saw this in the cinema and laughed so much I had to get in on DVD, the sound track is amazing and I had a trip down memory lane, so much so I had to down load no diggity!<br /><br />It appealed to my husband myself as well as our teenagers
B0071MQBX0|5.0|What else can you say but WOW! Although my wife and I are fans of seeing these type of performances in person. This one actually was the next best thing. Not only is this a great show that has never been matched that I am aware of, but it also includes a great reunion and finale with the people who were the first to make this musical popular. Seeing Andrew Lloyd Weber with the most famous of his cast members and hearing his praise along with seeing the audience and thier reaction is the greatest. My wife and I will never forget our first and most memorable experience of seeing this show in London but we never would have expected something like this and at The Royal Albert Hall. I highly recommend this presentation.
B002NPUCRQ|4.0|I love the CD and it runs perfectly, no skips<br />The DVD also runs smoothly<br />The case was broken at arrival
B001CQONKY|5.0|excellent, practic. Confortable. Beautifull. Recomendable. Economic.<br />El producto cumple con lo que se ofrece en las especificaciones del vendedor. Gracias.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Racketeer,<br />Very good plot. One can think doing it yourself,would be nice.<br />Could not stop reading.<br />It is very advisible !
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I liked it. It had lot's of humor, that I did not expect. I liked it and gave it 5 stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book. I was looking for something new to read. I like a book to grab me at the very beginning and that is what this did! I would love a squeal to this!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love Angry Birds.  It's fun and frustrating at the same time.  It's scientifically based on Newtonian mechanics and it's still fun, which is pretty cool.<br /><br />My only complaint about Angry Birds is that I don't seem to be aqble to stop playing it.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|writing is too sarcastic, plot is unbelievable and just generally boring.  I find it great to put me to sleep and it has been doing that for at least 2 weeks and I haven't finished it yet.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|The Lumineers have very good music. I would suggest them to anyone who likes XX or Mumford and Sons, or any band of similar sound.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|i also liked this one,didn't love it, but i did like it very much.it was sort of the beginning of ailains, or so i thought
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I wish it didn't limit the number of characters you could input. But it does do the job. It works.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted film! Kudos to the cinematographer, editor, and photographic/film effects team members. The search, global in scope, manages to keep the viewer in a state of suspense to the very grand finale end. If you are a musician, do yourself a favor and watch this film!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you loved the first season the second is just as good! Definitely a worthwhile purchase. PBS does it again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game.  it works. i'm glad i can use it where ever i am with my kindle fire.  that's all.
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|the cast did a very good job. daniel craig was very good, rooney mara was excelent, BUT hollywood did it's usual hatchet job on this movie. i read the book, have the swedish movie of all three books. they were far better than hollywoods try.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I think the angry birds was wayyyyyy better to me this app was a wast of my time!!  :-/ I really hate it its not fun at all to me REALLY SUCKS
1439102430|1.0|I am normally a died-in-the-wool Kathy Reichs fan. Loved all of her books, until this one, and love \\"Bones.\\" THIS BOOK, however is beyond terrible! I don't know what she was thinking or doing...fulfilling a contractual obligation perhaps? I read the terrible reviews before I bought this book and probably should have paid more attention before donating my eleven bucks to her. Page after page, paragraph after paragraph of useless filler. Hell, I think I could be a certified CAT scan tech by the time she finished describing one. The problem with Ryan and Ollie? Does it have to be described and re-described over and over. We get it, Kathy. They don't like each other. Yes, this is a terrible subject but Lordy, does she have to make it even worse by describing, again in damn near microscopic detail, the remains? I won't finish this book and my money is gone. For this I, as a fan, am terribly sorry I wasted my hard earned cash and completely angry with Ms. Reichs for even allowing this piece of (insert your favorite noun here) to be published. Please, don't waste your money on this effort.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is one of the best horse apps out there for horse lovers that are having withdrawals from their real horses. Just wish I got to chooses what my horse looked like and the name.
B003O86FMW|5.0|well i was hooked with the first book.(I have not seen the movie). So I had to buy the second book and was not disappointed with the second.  And of course I bought the third and final book. I do like books about the future. I do wish there will be a fourth book about how we will survive all the corruption and all live peacefully.A dream I know but one can hope.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Paper Galaxy is pure fun. It oozes charm. The visuals are appealing and the music and sound is perfect. The Gameplay is easy to pick up and addictive for all ages. A steal at that price. A MUST PLAY!!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, it's basically Mario's bros. The controls are easy and the concept is the same but it's still a good game to pass the time with.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|This is the first Gary Oldman movie that I didn't like.  My husband watched about 10 minutes, and walked out of the room.  The ending is good, but it's so painful to have to sit through the entire film just for them to tie it all together at the end (cleverly, but still....)  Would NOT recommend buying this -- if you must see it, find a 99 cent rental.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I would have liked the option of a more complete (two-disc) film soundtrack.  The music is fine, but the song selection is a little odd.  Do You Hear The People Sing and Lovely Ladies are missing, but the extremely abridged Drink With Me and the fall of the barricade (instrumental) are there.  It's kind of nice to have sound effects (rain, cannon, etc.), and Valjean's song &#34;Suddenly&#34; is new from the film.  Apart from that, there are numerous more complete recordings, in particular the Complete Symphonic Recording from the 1990s.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Just excellent it was exactly what i expected.. I would buy it again.<br />Probably i will buy another one. Hope my kids do not destroy the controller too soon.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Adam Sandler was great as Dracula and Selena Gomez was good as his daughter Mavis. This movie was funny in its own way.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|What a powerful story.  The struggle, the determination, the absolute horror all made this a novel I would definitely recommend to others.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Ok - I don't get her. I personally don't think she's a very good actress.  Charlize Theron is beautiful, and plays her part well.  The costumes are awesome, and the special effects are -- well, SPECIAL.  And I enjoy seeing childhood fairytales told for adults.  Wish they had cast someone other than Kristen Stewart, though....But that being said, I'm glad I bought it, as I'm sure I'll watch it again sometime.
0375842209|5.0|This is so beautifully written. I love that it's in the voice of &#34;Death&#34; and how he actually seems compassionate toward the heroine. I cried and cried at the end.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game for the challenge that other solitaire games don't have.  It makes the mind work hard to try an solve it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Every step flowed smoothly and we have enjoyed the easy sign on and the video quality is excellent. great job.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this down.  I laughed, I cried, I held my breath.  Wonderfully written.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I'm a sucker for the tales with a twist (think Wicked -- made me feel sorry for the Wicked Witch).  I had watched a show mid-season and thought it was &#34;okay&#34; - but my son insisted that I watch from the pilot all the way through the first season. What a difference!  Clever writing, to get all of these characters intertwined in a cohesive storyline. And the costumes are incredible!!  I'd watch this show just to see the costumes.  The person who makes them is a genius -- wish I could find a place to buy one for a costume party (which I would throw JUST to wear the costume).  Can't wait until Season Two is out.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book says its ok to be the person that you are.  As one who is extremely creative with strong introvert tendencies, and constantly trying to &#34;fit in&#34; with our extremely extroverted culture, it was very freeing.  This book says it like it is and speaks the truth! Cudo's for her research and presentation. A very powerful book. Highly recommend it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing game! Excellent graphics! I especially like how in this version you can get bonuses throughout the board (ex: invincibility, coin magnet, resurrection gems and much much more!) You can also buy different characters with the coins you earn, along with extra abilities for your character. The board is much more interesting than the first game, from zip lining down ropes to jumping in a high speed runaway rollercoaster cart, just beware of the broken track! I highly recommend this game, VERY ADDICTING!!!!
B0015AARJI|4.0|Excellent product, very good quality. The only downside is that it did not bring the cable to charge, which should come packaged with control.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is my favorite game. I think that I should be able to get quicker updates from amazon though because all of my friends are telling me how awesome the new update is. It is the best game that I have ever played.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|This movie has a pretty decent cast, but it's missing something.  The story line could have been better; it needed more substance.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I am a huge fan of the musical Les Miserables because of my parents, and when I heard about the new movie including the songs I HAD to buy this soundtrack. I am very impressed with it and find it super awesome. Totally worth it and I can't wait to see the movie!!<br />-Faith
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Love, love, loved this book. A high-tech, low-tech mystery,  book lovers book! When an umemployed guy takes a job on the overnight shift at an all night book store the intrigue begins. Then he meets the excentric set of characters that show up at all hours of the night only to rent the books instead of buy his interest is piqued. When he realizes all the books they check out are written in code, he  must solve the mystery! Great set of characters that are well formed by the author. In the end your rooting for them to solve the mystery!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|What a great way to spend a little down time! Very entertaining, great quality game with excellent graphics. Fun for any age!
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Although my history-buff husband refused to watch this, i thought it was highly entertaining.  I did, however, read the book first, and I liked how they intertwined actual events into this somewhat silly but fun movie.
B007TNS6JI|1.0|I got this because it was free, looked like a cool RP, and I really wanted an RP game for my new kindle fire.  But after I downloaded it it wouldn't play. The screen would go blank when I clicked on it. Nothing would happen no matter how long I waited. I was very disappointed with it and would not recommend it to anyone.<br />-Faith
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|Very enjoyable.  I loved the lines that are brought in from the original.<br />Excellent action.  Great acting and special effects!
0316228532|2.0|I struggled to read this book, loosing interest frequently it has taken me over 8 weeks to read and I read everyday.  The biggest issue that I had was that I would read a few pages and then fall asleep ( that is not normal). The basic plot was well written and the characters intertwined, but the storyline left a bit to be desired.  It was readable but a real struggle.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I don't have anything negative to say about this television series: it's smartly written with an all-star cast. Benedict Cumberbatch has the brusque, no-nonsense attitude that works for a modern day Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman portrays Watson with a mild-manner fashion that is an enjoyment to watch. Both Cumberbatch and Freeman have great chemistry along with Rupert Graves (Lestrade).<br /><br />I highly recommend this is you're into fast-pace, interactive, and emotional television show with the feel of full-length adventures! In my opinion, the two last episodes of the second season shined brighter than the previous episodes -- and those were fantastic!
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I thought it was awesome that the band is two brothers and a sister. They sound amazing together! The cd is totally worth the money! I love every song on it, which is how I a cd worth the cash. I wouldn't recommend it if I only liked their hit songs on it, but it's all good.<br />-Faith
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Despite what critics said about \\"loopholes\\" in the the story and how nonsensical the plot it, I think this movie is more intelligent than Tomb Raider and Mission Impossible 3 together. And it beats any Tom Cruise movie to the ground and then blows it up.<br />I think the real reason nobody really loved this movie is that it's very NOT sexy. IDK, maybe Angelina and the director wanted to show that the main character does not rely on her sexuality to get what she wants, and that they certainly did :(<br />Evelyn Salt could probably take James Bond in a combat, but in terms of sex life, hers is non-existant. She would look like a nun next to 007. An awesome nun who kills without remorse!<br />Still a great movie, though.
B008Q0B0I2|5.0|It's an instant classic for sure.  An amazing fairy tale/ love story/ adventure.  It's one to buy, keep, and treasure.
1250027624|5.0|Another winner about the beloved television show! As mentioned by previous reviewers, the book focuses on the characters in the show more than the previous book. There is plenty of information from and about men and women who were in service and their views on their positions. A natural \\"next-read\\" after The World of Downton Abbey as season three continues on Sunday nights.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I had never played or understood angry birds before I got my kindle fire and got the free app. I now am hooked! I don't find the few ads on it a problem at all and strongly recommend the free app over spending money just to be rid of the few ads that only come up when the game is paused. It's super fun. Doesn't need wi-fi. And very addicting!<br />-Faith
B009NTNHJU|3.0|I would have given this 5 stars, were it not for the misleading information provided about it!<br />The product description says that the DVD has the music videos for the songs in the album.<br />In reality, it's just a bunch of behind-the-scenes footage and for the most part Nicki seems tired and annoyed.<br />DON'T GET ME WRONG, IT'S AWESOME, BUT!!! I was expecting the videos.<br />I don't blame Amazon, though. The packaging has a track listing for the DVD, but those are just the songs that appear (for five seconds or less) in the footage. As in &#34;I'm late for this video with Justin Bieber, the concept is great *yawn* I'm Nicki Minaj and I endorse these snippets&#34; (song plays for 2 seconds)
067960085X|5.0|This was a very good book. I was very surprised by how different the book is from the movies but although I do prefer the movie for the story Breakfast at Tiffany's, it was still good and well written. Look forward to adding more Truman Capote books to my collection.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I do like it on my kindle but it is much better on PC and you can do much more on PC too...
B000089RV6|5.0|Must I say more. Music that requires volume. This stuff gets you pumped. 7 more words required. Done. Now get your ACDC on!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Like the books. Wish it was based more in a closer reality than far , far in the future.  But still enjoy the books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A lot more than I expected for free. There is a game for everyone. The games are fun and challenging. Its easy to earn coins to unlock games as you go. My kids enjoy the games as well. This is one of the best game apps runs perfectly on Kindle fire HD.
B0074AGVWK|3.0|Great book as Maeve always produces.  Was sorry when book ended, so sorry that Maeve has passed away taking her wonderful future books with her.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|When I first bought this I only used when I ran.<br /><br />Now I wear it everywhere every day. The battery life is very good for how small and compact it is.<br /><br />I have been very happy with this product.
0345803493|5.0|This book draws you into it and it's characters from the very beginning. Very visual writing.  Extremely enjoyable. I couldn't wait for the next chapter!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|My kids are second-generation Star Wars fans.  We can enjoy these classic films together!  While the effects, script and directing style in Epsodes IV-VI are different than the newer Episodes I-III, they are brilliant in their own way, and we will never be tired of watching them.  It is an entirely new experience watching them in Blu-Ray, however!
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|One of the best helicopter games I've found yet. The gyro controls are not my cup of tea but they work well. The joystick control is perfect. The missions are short but fun and start very easy to get you used to the game. Someone needs to proofread for the dev though.  A very solid game with some really bad english in the instructions and descriptions.
1451629184|5.0|Great book.  Very heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time.  This woman really is a strong person.  I recommend this book to anyone who has a child.
0345803507|5.0|This book draws you into it and it's characters from the very beginning. Very visual writing.  Extremely enjoyable. I couldn't wait for the next chapter! I was sad when I finished the series.  I wanted more.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This is not the most recent material by Three Days Grace, but my daughter loves every song on here.  She claimes it is her favorite Christmas present.  Even the parents (me) are enjoying this music.
0399215980|2.0|Pay attention to the description of this item. I quickly bought this for my classroom without reading the dimensions of the book. It is TINY and completely useless for what I was going to use it for.
B000ID37T0|5.0|For the longest time I avoided watching Al Pacino films for the simple fact that I thought his acting style was kind of flamboyant and dramatic. Then a few months back, I saw Godfather 3 and though the film failed to be very good, Pacino was bang on target. I then watched a film called \\"Panic in the needle park\\" which I think was his first film and I was like wow, where is this man coming from. I have been recommended Scent of a woman since God knows how long and then I finally saw it.<br /><br />This is one of those rare long films where you wish the film is not going to end and you continue watching because the Pacino's character is so interesting and I found myself applauding the very flamboyant nature I didn't like in Al Pacino more and more as the film went along. Ha!<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />One can make a note of top 5 quotes and top 5 scenes about this film. For me my favourite scene was the one where the old man is about to kill himself and sends the young boy away. I also liked the Waltz scene and what followed, how \\"SHARP\\" the old man is and how he always knows what's going on around him. Pacino made this more believable and it is said of blind people that their memory is very sharp, imagine a very sharp person who turns blind...<br /><br />His drinking made me laugh and so did his absolute abandon to his own cause. I don't know how to write about this film. There were many scenes that made me laugh and stunned me at the same time. The direction is stellar. I am now going to watch \\"Serpico\\"
0345803485|5.0|This book draws you into it and it's characters from the very beginning. Very visual writing.  Extremely enjoyable. I couldn't wait for the next chapter!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|The cloud is without a doubt the greatest way to store music, books, games etc when you are not using them. It beats having to keep up with an external device to store your apps on.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Okay, I still love the movie, but the book... Oh, the book. I adore this book.<br /><br />I had never been introduced to Fannie Flagg's writing before reading Fried Green Tomatoes, but reading it has made me want to track down her other books. Once I started reading this, I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book.
B008220DIC|3.0|I waited for the Master for the longest because this was easily the most anticipated film of 2012 for me. I saw it yesterday and I cannot help but be at the crossroads with this film. An actor is often born to do a role and PTA has a quality I most like in him to give feature, character and a hopelaiden finish to his characters.<br /><br />Be it Daniel Day Lewis, Mark Wahlberg, Paul Dano, Tom Cruise, Adam Sandler or even John Reily, PTA constructed them into characters and armed them and positioned them most well in his films. Their confidence, their overwhelming character portrayal, their dialogues, the derivation all was very well done.<br /><br />Now here's where I am at a sort of crossroad about THE MASTER, you see Hoffman not since Savages has played a role so well, so meant for him and Joaquin Phoenix has never played a more poignant unforgettable character than he does in here. BUT, and here's a huge but, the film left me with no answers.<br /><br />It isn't based on capitalism, it isn't based on the dogma of war, isn't necessarily based on anything but understanding psychology and character of the two center characters. You're often looking for clues to understand what to believe in, it's a tedious watch but after all those films, I'm left wondering if I should actually watch The Master again, did I miss something?<br /><br />I don't understand why people are praising Amy Adams, all she does is sit on a chair the whole film and express concern and worry. Maybe she was the only character who was easy to understand? I don't know. She was like furniture.<br /><br />Hoffman and Phoenix both act in some of their best roles in their lives. I don't think Phoenix could have been cast better. I did observe however that the latter half of the film doesn't offer many beautiful sets to look at like the first fifteen minutes of the film.<br /><br />There is an overwhelming sense of Americana in the film and I liked that about all PTA films. But the film while it contained a generous amount of drama, ends up being a bit too cynically clout in it's own delirium I hate to admit. Obviously PTA sees something here that I dont and never will. I was a bit exasperated after the film ended not knowing what to believe. I noticed the theme of changing partners present in the score the whole film and it finally played in the end.<br /><br />So to all viewers - I'd say \\"take it easy\\" , this is not at opinionated as any of his films. It's like that one book in the library that is falling into tatters...you go you pick it up and start reading very confused at first, you read ten chapters of what you understand...and then you wonder if you should go on or give up.d a generous amount of drama, ends up being a bit too cynically clout in it's own delirium I hate to admit.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I purchased the LifeProof case for my Iphone 4S. I could not hear the person on the other end and they could not hear me. It was very muffled. When trying to end a call it would not let me. I kept trying and it just kept going and going back in to the perons's voice mail. Finally I have no idea how it ended the call, but it did. I think the plastic cover on the front was wrinkled and it wasn't a tight fit on the screen. When turning on the music it had a very muffled sound.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|It was well written but incredibly frustrating at points. Almost as if Martin added extra intrigue just for the sake of intrigue. Also, if you want a book about Good v Evil...and you want Good to win, this is probably not the best choice. You see hope in these books, and then you see it dashed.

B0074PNCRM|5.0|When i started reading this book i was doubting if i would enjoy the story as the characters were in a quite depressing condition. As the story progress, i started loving the characters and their witty banters. This book is one of those books that when you're done reading, you would ponder about life. It makes you think, makes you see things in a different perspective. It is funny, engaging, the characters are lovable/adorable  and it is heartbreaking. I highly recommend this book. it is one of the best.

0545140323|4.0|Full review on Reader's Dialogue: [...]  This is a really sweet, smart book. Penny makes her decision to swear off boys based on her past experiences, especially being betrayed so horrifically by a boy she trusted all her life. At first it's a club of one, but when her friends one by one get hurt by the boys in their lives, they join, and it soon becomes a school phenomenon. Penny deals with her newfound star status really well. I love how she keeps her wits about her and makes each decision based on what is happening at the time - yes, based on how she feels, but when it comes to her friends versus keeping her absolute popularity, she knows how to navigate things, and she knows what's best for her friends. She is able to sacrifice her views and opinions when her friends have a chance at happiness - and ultimately that's what allows her to have her own chance at happiness.    Though due to a series of unfortunate misunderstandings, her chance at happiness seems far away throughout most of the book. The whole book is a comment on the interactions between boys and girls, and this element captures things perfectly, the way adolescents dance around each other when they like each other and are not sure they're liked back. But in the end, it all works out, so Penny is lonely no more!
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|I have been listening to Ben Harper for a long time and although not everything he has released has been to my liking I was excited to here about this release. I purchased this the day it was available for Pre-Sale on Ben Harpers web site to get the cool premium items they were offering.<br /><br />Wow, this album does not dissapoint. Ben sounds like he has always sung the blues.....I guess in some ways he has. These two have incredible chemistry. I don't think Ben could have done an album like this without Charlie Musselwhite. The man is a true harmonica playing legend.<br /><br />The DVD included is well worth watching if you are a fan of either gentleman. The interviews show that they genuinely like each other but I guess that shows in the quality of the music that they just released.<br /><br />As far as I am concerned this is an album that is a must buy.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a icu rn for 30 years I have seen death come to many. I experienced a nde many years before and because of that do not have the fear of dying that many do. I have seen patients reaching for something and smiling before they die. My own experience has allowed me to give comfort to love one's at that time.  This book will hopefully give solace to many because of his credentials and hopefully make other physicians listen to their patients when they recount their experience.

0765325950|5.0|A few years back, I decided to break my habit of reading classical literature by picking up a modern fantasy novel.  After seeing the Lord of the Ring movies and being miffed by the allure, my husband encouraged me to read the books which he had on hand for elaboration and clarification on what he felt was one of the best stories in all time.  I became hooked on the genre and wanted to see what else was out there.  After some preliminary research on top-rated, modern, epic fantasy I began with Robert Jordan's Wheel of time series.  A couple of books in to it I was hooked.  He swept me away on a journey that began another journey in to modern epic fantasy, which is now the only genre that I touch.<br /><br />This being said, the ending to the beginning of this journey was an emotional one for me.  Sanderson's masterful weaving in the last few books tied off by Jordan's brilliant ending pulled my heart strings in ways that only a master weaver can do.  I laughed, I cried, I raged at the deaths of my beloved characters and the injustice of evil in the world.  I and rejoiced and wept at the triumph of goodness over nothingness.  And when all was said and done, I closed the cover and began to mourn the loss of these characters and this world that touched me so deeply.  I also mourn Robert Jordan, who though I did not know, touched my heart and introduced me to me to Brandon Sanderson, who is not only a brilliant writer, but is also, like Jordan, a rare, good man of substance and depth.  Writers such as these, who not only have great skill at weaving, but also have hearts filled with dreams of good conquering evil, do the world a great favor in sharing their gifts.  There is too much evil in our present world and they give us hope that in the end, love always triumphs.  I thank them.<br /><br />It was a beginning for me.  And the ending to that beginning was equisite.

B008D36INE|2.0|This film is beautifully shot and staged, and the acting is well done.  There are my only 2 positive comments.  Now, to my criticisms.<br /><br />As many others have mentioned, the shrieking, beyond melodramatic violin score through the initial scenes made me feel like I wanted to claw my skin off.  Someone needs to instruct director Terence Davies that a film score is supposed to draw the audience IN to the story line, not make them wish to run for the nearest exit.  We are introduced to the main character, Hester, as she is attempting suicide with every means at her disposal in her squalid post-war flat. In a mixture of flashbacks and real-time, we are shown the situations that supposedly brought her to this point.<br /><br />For the sake of (unrequited) love and passion, Hester has thrown over her rich older husband (a judge) for an oily, selfish ex-RAF officer. She and her lover are so immature and dim and self-destructive that I can feel nothing like sympathy for either one of them.  Hester apparently longs for the kind of ill-fated, all consuming love she read about as a girl in Wuthering Heights or Abelard & Heloise; but WWII comes along and so she takes safe refuge in a sterile marriage to a well-off old man. He loves her deeply, but she treats him like a favorite uncle. Not surprisingly, she's bored and miserable.<br /><br />We first meet Freddie, now back a few years from the war.  He admits in an early meeting in a pub with Hester that \\"nothing can compare to surviving the Battle of Britain,\\" so it's clear that his emotional intelligence is frozen at that high-adrenaline moment in time; what sexual relationship is ever going to measure up to that high water mark in a chap's life?  While Hester is totally besotted with Freddie, the most romantic thing we ever hear from him is, \\"I say, you really are the most attractive girl I've met.\\"  Finally, in a scene about 1/2 way through the film, we see that the reason Hester tried to off herself in the first scene is because Freddie callously spent the weekend in the country with friends and not only missed her birthday, but forgot it entirely. Missed birthday = dirt nap, at least in Hester's overwrought imagination.<br /><br />Some reviewers have mentioned \\"how romantic\\" and \\"how tragic\\" this story was, and how it brought them to tears.  If this is really the depiction of a love story that you can relate to, then I fear for your future happiness.  In fact, the only time I personally teared up was when Hester witnesses the elderly landlady tending to her dying husband of many, many years and she lets Hester have it straight: \\"You don't have any idea what real love is. Real love is wiping someone's ass, or changing the sheets on the bed because he wets them; it's being there and letting them keep their dignity.\\"  For me, that was the high point of the film.is because Freddie callously spent the weekend in the country with friends and not only missed her birthday, but forgot it entirely.

B00B19DMUE|2.0|I gave this movie 2 stars only because I love Kyra Sedgwick. Unfortunately, it didn't seem like she was in it much. Maybe it was because I was fighting to stay awake the first hour of the movie. The last 15-20 minutes was the best part of the movie. The rest of the movie was agonizingly slow, very boring camera pans. Honestly, if I hadn't paid $6 to see it on VOD I would've turned the channel long before it got interesting. There were some interesting special effects like when their eyes rolled sideways back into their heads but other than that, it was much more about scaring yourself with anticipation of something happening than the movie actually being scary. The movie was more about a family learning to cope with divorce more than a scary movie. All in all, a very forgettable movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love this cast, just wish Taissa Farmiga would have been in this season! Heard she's thinking about season 3 though! Fingers crossed!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Not the best novel I've read, however some nice ideas and good parody of the known Red Shirt mortality rate of the genre.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I loved this film because it shows you, that if your faith in God is strong, nothing is impossible when you least expect it..
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|OMG! This movie was painful. If I could give it negative stars I would. I was afraid to go to the theatre to see it because I had low expectations. I watched it on VOD instead and only paid $6 and I want my money back! The movie would probably be about 20 minutes long if they cut all the parts where nothing was going on and you're just sitting there looking at an empty room. After about an hour, I fast forwarded it to the end and I'm glad I did because I would have to hurt someone after waiting that long to see the last ridiculous 2 minutes. There was another movie I wanted to watch by the same director but after this, it will be a very long time before I watch another movie by him. Watch this movie AYOR! It's honestly one of the worse movies I've ever seen.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Great family movie, great lesson taught of not desiring to change someone but accept them for who they are and love them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it! So much better than the original temple run.  Very exciting &amp; challenging!!!  Be aware.. it's very addicting!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This is the third book in a trilogy, be sure to read the first two books in the series first, but read it! It is an excellent and original series. There are many books out there involving a dystopian future but this one is really worth your while. It is listed as young adult but anyone who enjoys thrilling adventure stories will enjoy this series.
B009O2XY12|3.0|Got this for free so can't complain too much, but game won't run unless it has a  strong active WIFI connection to run so it can keep sending little ads.  I can easily ignore the ads and keep playing but I am not always near a strong connection.  I have other games and bubble games that send ads and have no problem playing them while this one fails.

B005EGXTEE|5.0|I saw the movie not really knowing much and really enjoyed it so I bought the book for my kindle so I could read it on my trip to Thailand. Well I couldn't put it down and ended up reading all three books in my down time sitting in airports and on planes.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone.  It's a bit dark at times but still a great series. Can't wait for the rest of the films.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|So much fun and suspense, always on the edge of our seats.  The only problem is the seasons are too short and the time between seasons is TOO long, almost to fault.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I discovered this series before it exploded on the pop culture radar. It is an action packed story full of characters to love and care about. One of the reasons I like it so much is because at its basic level it is a story about a girl and her people just wanting to live in peace and to be happy. Something everyone can relate to.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book really puts things into perspective and that makes it wonderfully beautiful. I loved this book so very much.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I have a confession. I bought this CD to give as a gift. I wanted to share her music, with my violinist sister. I just wasn't sure the music would be half as fun without the video and her dancing antics. I thought I'll just listen to it once or twice before I wrap it. Well, that was it, I'm hooked and can't part with it now. I've always been a sucker for any song with a violin part anywhere in it. I also like lively music that gets your toes tapping. And toe-tapping violin is what this is. So this Would make a great gift. Just be sure to order two, so you can keep one for yourself. It is also my most requested CD to play when friends come to visit.
B0074NEPI4|3.0|My son loves these magnet toys, we have Magz and Webz so I thought we would try some geomag. The magnets are strong and my son loves the glow in the dark feature but the creations fall apart too easy. the glow in the dark panels are very flimsy plastic so they can't hold any weight and of course the magnet bars and steel balls are pretty heavy so it doesn't work very well. This was a nice idea, but a poor execution.
B003O86FMW|5.0|While I love this series I have to admit this was my least favorite book of the trilogy. That being said catching fire is still excellent and continues Katniss' s great story.

Opens with a great performance by Muddy Waters and ends with a sweet jam on a stage packed with blues legends including Buddy Guy, Junior Wells, and Lefty Dizz., Watch for original Rolling Stone Ian Stewart to join the jam on piano.

1451613512|4.0|Hello there. I just want to give a short comment on the introduction of this product. I really don't see the US. as the savior of the world. neither do many countries. Instead, I see the U.S. as a country that wants to impose their beleifs and pseudo democracy and freedom of idealism to the rest of the \\"uncivilized world\\" as they call us.I m just an avarage citizen from Central America. but I, as many people, am becoming aware of the U.S. overseas policies. the U.S. has its right, as the rest of the countries of the world, to have their own internal political system. just to mention some cases: Syria being target of U.S. militia in some way, Julian Assange being persecuted for making public (not being the author) of archives, leaving Cuba out of the OEA or any other meeting, etc. Anyways, i will purchase this book, looks interesting...
B0000AGQ6Z|5.0|super bit DVD is near Bluray quality.  Audio is excellent as well.  The first disc ends abruptly w/ intermission in 2nd DVD but not really a big deal.
1616960922|5.0|Sanderson once again surprises with yet another completely creative 'universe' of magic with logical rules of application, inhabited by a few memorable characters that leave you not only wanting more, but spinning plausible storylines in your head for days after you finish reading.<br />Not only will you CARE what happens to his characters, but you will want to know more about this world, this empire, these artists who 'forge' reality, and what this particular young lady you've come to cheer for decides to make of herself next.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is an awesome writer!  This book so played out totally different than I was thinking it was going to!  And when you get to the part that really says it all about the title &#34;HOPELESS&#34;  it just broke my heart!  So much of it could be so scary and so real at the same time!
B0043UB0BQ|3.0|Much to much blood and gore.  The simulation of severed heads and limbs is way overdone to my way of thinking.
B00A3AYI50|4.0|I recommend this cd to everyone!  This CD is perfect for chilling out.  &#34;Home&#34; is a catchy song and cant seem to get enough.
1603427244|5.0|I had no idea there were so many ways to cast on and bind off! I love that the author specifies what methods work for what types of stitches you are starting and ending with. That makes a big difference in how the finished edges look. It took a bit of effort to master what seemed to be easy methods, but as with the long-tail/Continental cast-on, which took me 3 days to get the hang of, once you know it, you KNOW it.
B0054XOMX4|3.0|its a strong beyblade but the tip is really wobbly and it only spins for 4 min so its alright.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have to say that this is probably my favorite of the three seasons of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; to date. It makes me crave to see how this season of twists and unexpected and devastating tragedies will be resolved in the future. I definitely do recommend!
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|This is a great CD.  I've been listening to Papa Roach for years now...they continue to live up to my expectations!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a great book! It is complex and thought provoking. Martel creates a story to which the reader feels like they are living the lines of the story right there next to Pi. Beware it is completely impossible to but down! Loved it!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I was looking to start reading the literary classics as a way to treat my brain after reading so much fluff lately. I had started Moby Dick last year (still haven't finished it) and was weary that this was going to fall in the same category. Not so!<br />I have never watched the movie that came out back in the 90's and have never seen any of the vampire movies that are out now. I'm only 31- not like I'm old, I just didn't have an interest. This book was amazing though.<br /><br />It only took me about two days to read because I couldn't put it down.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to get lost in a fiction book.
B0095R64AO|3.0|i had high hopes for this movie. i was under the impression it would be a hilarious movie, but it fell short. a decent watch with some lagging in the middle. the end was heart warming though!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely love the fact that the Kindle reader is available for Android! I have 2 Android devices; a smartphone and a tablet. I have it on both, as well as my PC (Kindle PC). I also love the way Kindle synchronizes from device to device. And the number of FREE books is in the thousands! I highly recommend this device and software. It is especially helpful for seniors, after the modest learning curve.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This should be on everyone's shelf next to the book on shelter-building, fire-starting, and local edible plants. It's an easy read, has lots of good tips, and I love the historical records section.<br /><br />One criticism: Brooks shows is New York city-dweller-ness in the weapons section. You'll be better served getting your weapon advice (especially gun-related advice) from an experienced weapons expert.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|exciting story and never did catch on about who was the killer.  Thought characters were interesting,especially Julie & Robie showed tenderness toward her at  stressful times.  Great thriller.Interaction of charactrs wonderful  Will try &#34;The Forgotten &#34; next.

B007XNAQLA|5.0|I am a huge RTF fan, and this CD/DVD is outstanding!  Core members Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, with guitarist Frank Gambale, and violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, are great combination. What makes this different from the usual RTF shows, is that each member contributed compositions, so all the songs were not RTF related. Great arrangments, great musicianship, great performance!  The DVD not only includes performances, but interviews of the musicians. Great price for two CDs and a DVD!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I've always been a sci-fi fan, but am commonly disappointed by the available fare, be it due to poor story or believability. Serenity (and the Firefly series) require a little suspension of disbelief, but are solidly grounded in excellent storytelling, subtle humor, and fun settings. Joss Whedon has set a new standard that Star Trek and Star Wars can never hope to regain.

B000009EAD|5.0|Iced Earth has been at the top of the quality spectrum of Metal for decades now, and this album is as good as it gets. It's got classic IE heavy riffs, an instrumental, ballad-style songs, and the &#34;Something Wicked&#34; trilogy that is to die for. Matt Barlow is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) voice Heavy Metal has ever seen, and pairs perfectly with Jon Schaffer's unmatched writing style.
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|I always liked Peter Jackson's version of King Kong, but I love the Extended version all the more with the added monster footage!

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a wonderful read- the characters had depth and I loved learning about the meanings of flowers.  I have suggested it to other book clubs!
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Great movies and great acting is suppose to make you feel for the characters and this movie does that.  I had never heard of the book.  And to be honest the only reason I was even interested in the movie is because of Emma Watson.  The movie impressed me tremendously.  The characters were all done so well and believable.  If you're thinking this is another teen movie because of the age of the actors, you are so wrong.  I don't have the words to say just how good this movie really is or how much I loved it.  I really wish they had, had the budget to get it into more theatres.  In my opinion this is the best movie of 2012.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have no trouble believing this amazing, wonderful story.  And it helps me tremendously to live successfully in this challenging and limited world.

B007ZTLLMK|4.0|I played this game on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it is actually pretty fun. A bit challenging to get the controls at first but you get used to them pretty fast. You have 2 styles of controls. Gyro controls or an on screen joystick control. Both are easy to use and don't take long to get used to. Pretty fun to play for all ages. Hope this helps.

0425263908|4.0|Bared to you was recommeded to me by a co-worker.<br /><br />I enjoyed the story and can recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the 50 Shades Trilogy or its Twilight Fanfiction name, Master of the Universe. I didn't start out to write a review that focused on the similarities between these series, but I can't help it - they're there and they're obvious!<br /><br />In my humble view Crossfire is well written simply because I kept turning the page to find out what would happen next. That for me is a well written story, and it's what kept me reading Crossfire and 50 Shades, Master and Twilight - the book series that started it all!<br /><br />Neither Crossfire nor 50 Shades was written by their respective authors to be the great American or British novel and neither pretend to be. Quite frankly, both series are commercial pieces and that's what most authors want. Writing is as much a job with a pay check, as it is a love affair with the written word.<br /><br />The writing style in the first Crossfire book flowed and it was easy to read, although the endless gratuitous sex scenes bored me silly - I'd much rather learn about what the characters are doing out of bed - and I hate the use of the C-Word as an acceptable name for female genitalia. The C-Word was used a number of times by Gideon as he talked dirty to Eva and I found it interesting that she wasn't offended, because I was.<br /><br />Having said all of the above, I immediately read the the second book in the series, Reflected in You, and enjoyed that, as well - there was less sex (though still plenty of it) and more angst...more story.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the Crossfire series is cashing in on the success of 50 Shades, which began its life as a Twilight fanfiction called Master of the Universe.<br /><br />The similarities in all four series are obvious: the heroine's father is a cop, the hero has an OCD personality with dominant, overprotective-stalker qualities, and he's filthy rich and secretive. She's trying to figure him out and rescue him from himself. And with the amount of moody whiplash going around, I'm surprised any of the characters from any of the series can hold their head up.<br /><br />Edward Cullen, Christian Grey or Gideon Cross / Bella Swan, Ana Steele or Eva Trammell - whoever your favorite character/s is/are, the stories are pleasurable escapism with just the right amount of angst to have you rooting for the main characters and booing for the bad guys.<br /><br />Thanks Ms Meyer - who'd have ever thought that Twilight, a story written for young adults, would spawn such great adult stories. Enjoy the Crossfire Trilogy for what it is - a great, easy read with characters you love, living out a fantasy life you'd run a million miles from in reality.

B002QKZLZ6|4.0|This is a quality case that is good for storage.  I would not recommend it for daily use if you are going to be taking it in and out of the case a lot just because it takes too long.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched this series since the beginning and it's not all drama, there are comic parts as well. Maggie Smith is hilarious and fantastic in her role as the Dowager Countess. My husband has also gotten into the show, so it is not just for women!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|What would you do if you found yourself orphaned, alone and in the middle of the ocean? Drown, surrender, pray? Now imagine you had company in the form of a dangerous predator.<br /><br />  We join the story of Piscine Molitor Patel in adulthood. Piscine, known as Pi (played by Irfan Khan) is an Indian living in Canada. One day, a young novelist comes to his door after being referred by a friend of his. Named after a swimming pool by his parents, Piscine came by his nickname after exhaustive chiding of his given name by classmates in school. His father ran a local zoo and Pi took an intense, and as far as his father was concerned, unhealthy, interest in the zoo's sole tiger. Named Richard Parker as the result of a clerical error, the tiger is fed a live goat while Pi bears witness in an effort by his father to instill an appropriate amount of fear. Though raised as a Hindu, Pi (played as an adolescent by Ayush Tandon) discovers Christianity as the result of a dare from his older brother and, by sheer chance, discovers Islam sometime after. As an adult, he refers to himself as a Catholic Hindu. At 16, Pi's father decides to close the zoo, sell the animals and move the family to Canada. This is a crushing development in the life of our main character as he has just fallen in love for the first time. The family and the animals make their journey west on a Japanese freighter. Woken by a severe storm, Pi goes to the top deck to marvel at the magnitude of the waves, wind, and rain. It is that extremely questionable decision which lands him in a lifeboat while his family and the rest of the crew sink with the ship. All this would make his chances of survival slim enough, but for better or worse, he's not alone in the boat. With him is Richard Parker the tiger, an orangutan he refers to as Orange Juice a zebra and a hyena.<br /><br />  This is an incredible movie. Some would say elements of the story are too fantastic to be believable but, with the first film in The Hobbit trilogy and the alleged final chapter in the Twilight saga currently in theaters, those objections seem hollow, to say the least. The struggle between man and beast and the eventual development of a symbiotic relationship between the two make for an extremely gripping tale. It's made even more so by the trials and tribulations they both encounter in their fight to survive. I thoroughly enjoyed Life of Pi, and wish I'd seen it sooner.trilogy and the alleged final chapter in the Twilight saga currently in theaters, those objections seem hollow, to say the least.

B002WV5A9G|4.0|It' s well done action from beginning to end, even the tear-jerky instances are Ok. It fun to watch old characters take on a new life.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This movie is wonderful, with the script, the acting, the setting, the costume, the special effects, the music...<br /><br />There are Kristen Stewart haters out there, especially because of her bad choices with the director of the movie, but I don't mind her. And how can you hate this film? It's totally awesome! I wish there was an alternate ending where Snow and Erik get together, but maybe it'll be concluded/referenced in the sequel. Or maybe it's open for us to decide.

B00AMBH70S|5.0|Renner plays someone who is much more  understandable than Damon. Still a constructed bad ass, but one I could sympathize with to a much greater extent.
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|The motion capture animation for this film is beyond phenomenal...I love Tintin, and Peter Jackson and Stephen Spielberg did a wonderful job with it :)<br /><br />What I don't like is that, for the BluRay/DVD combo, the special features were ALL on the BluRay. Can you tell me that BEFORE I go buy this special edition pack, when I could have saved money and bought the regular DVD? Now I can't watch the special features! I mean, seriously, what are you trying to say?

B0010SKUYM|5.0|So here's the thing. I don't spend ages trying to figure out plot devices, character development, etc. I pick up a book that intrigues me, and if it holds me, I dive in full force. If after 10-15 pages I have no reason to want to keep reading, I don't. I came to this book by a circuitous route- a blog post by Lynn Flewelling (I LOVE her nightrunner series but tanked on the Tamir Trilogy after the first book, if that tells you anything about my reader's persona) led me to the worldbuilder's effort for Heifer Intl on Patrick's blog. I'd never heard of him and so I thought &#34;while I&#34;m here, I'll try the book.&#34; Read books one and two in four days. And the second was 1000 pages! I loved it. Can't break down why. There wasn't too much politics, too  much foreign language to learn to keep up, too many characters with similar names.... it just grabbed me and held me. The ONLY thing that makes me mad is that I forgot my own rule to NEVER start a multibook series when all the books aren't out. DamnMyEyes, the third book doesn't even have a publication date yet. Damnit. It'll be on my Kindle reader as soon as it's available, though.
B001AEF6D6|5.0|For anyone who has a &#34;different&#34; sense of humor and often finds themself quoting movies, this is your movie. Its one of those movies everyone has to see at least once.

B003G4W49C|2.0|I was somehow fooled by the raving reviews & overrated praise of most readers. This novel is the first I read by this author; the storyline is interesting enough although I found the narration of Ender's training way too long and rather boring. To me, the other weakness of this novel is the somewhat flimsy psychology of the main characters (kids acting & thinking like adults). I liked the notion that one blogger can influence World politics and decision makers although it's a bit far fetched, of course. An Ok book, but honestly, I have read many SF novels much better than this one.

B005LAII8A|2.0|I hoped for a slick, Hollywood style high tension sci fi thriller, and that describes this move. Why only two stars? I was disappointed by some aspects of the film, and disgusted with one in particular.<br />First the good: this is a high quality production, with good actors, great scenery, professional editing, and an absence of weak characters. Everyone involved worked together to make a polished product.<br /><br />There were problems with believability, even inside of a sci fi story. How likely was it that the lead characters could run through a hail of full automatic gunfire from a dozen shooters, and walk away in one piece, while all the shooters end up dead? If you watch movies like this, you know the probability is approximately 100%. I know that it is just make-believe, but it gets tiresome.<br /><br />There are some twists and turns to the plot, but I would not call this an intelligent film. It doesn't stretch the imagination like Inception.<br /><br />This film deals in death, and death comes in high volume. The main character carries a shotgun, and his bosses carry absurdly oversized revolvers. The death count starts with the opening scene, and there aren't many death free scenes. Guns fire, the blood flies, bodies splatter, and bystanders are covered in blood, although not very realistically (through the ignorance of the filmmakers, not from a lack of trying). Some of the machine gunning takes place in a dance like sequence, although half of the dance card is a fresh corpse. The oversize handguns become a fetish object, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, the main character uses his shotgun as his signature prop. So many bodies pile up in one scene that the living characters practically wade through them. Even children are shot, and one is executed by a main character, although that particular death happens off-screen. There was way too much shooting and killing in this movie, much more than necessary, even though violence was central to the story. In the end there is one uplifting message, but it is buried in the gore.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the star and a producer of Looper. Some of his personal interests are included in the story. For example, he is a Francophile, and his character practices speaking French between kills. Ironically, his real life parents are founding members of the Progressive Jewish Alliance, an organization that lists an \\"end to gun violence\\" as one of their signature public efforts. They should have a talk with their son before they try to remodel the country. The culture of death starts at home.re is one uplifting message, but it is buried in the gore.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the star and a producer of Looper.

0345803485|2.0|Well, as you can see by the amazon reviews, most people either like the book or do not.  Rather than repeat what was in other 2 star reviews I will just say I read about 2/3 of the book and returned it to the library.<br /><br />The writing seems to be for teenagers.  I found the plot and all the emails tiresome.  I read a Sue Grafton book a few months ago and found the writing worse than this book.<br /><br />Maybe this is the norm for 'romance novels' and with some kinky stuff thrown in, people have a need to read.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see what the age demographics are regarding the average rating people gave in various age groups.<br /><br />If you are curious and want to save time google BDSM.  Read the amazon reviews first before getting the book.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|Book was disappointing. The main character John Corey spends way too much time making wise cracks rather then seriously pursuing the plot line. After a a couple hundred pages of relentless attempts at being funny in the face of life threatening situations it becomes tiresome.<br />The character of the panther was a poorly developed cliche.<br />The premise of Corey and his wife acting as bait for the Panther by visiting archaeologic sites in the desert of Yemen was a massive stretch and implausible even for DeMille. Nelson seems to be getting into a rut with his perpetually smart ass detective Corey-thankfully I think he has used up just about all the crazy islamic terrorists.<br />Mildly entertaining but not nearly up to the standards of his earlier work.
0307472590|4.0|I enjoyed it very much! a little slow at the beginning but then couldn't put my book down! First time reading a novel by Carlos Zafron, was very please with his style.
B004SKJTY6|2.0|But a promo. For a five minute promo about the movie, it's a good one, but that's all it is.

B00A9X9ORI|3.0|I had the premise of this movie before we rented it.  The writing and plot were well written and portrayed.  The only problem is that the concluding plot point which was only hinted at at the beginning of the movie was severely underdeveloped.  Once you see the last 20 minutes you will get my point on this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read a lot.  With that comes books that you like, some you love, and some you can honestly say will stay with you forever.  For me, Hopeless is a book that I will always remember.  I can't tell you why exactly.  I mean I love Colleen Hoover.  I have enjoyed all of her books thus far.  But Hopeless hit me in a way other books have not done.  I smiled, I laughed, and I cried.  I cried!  I don't cry when I read... well hardly ever.  But Hopeless brought me to tears.<br /><br />The characters are amazing, the story beyond anything I could imagine, and the whole package was superb.  I would definitely recommend this story and have done so many times.  I read over 120 books for 2012, but Hopeless made the top of the list.  Read it.  I am sure you won't be disappointed.
0670026603|5.0|A great read. Remarkable struggle of an inexperienced young woman dealing with a severely damaged young man. They are from different social/economic classes but find that each has a gift to impart. He urges her to try things she shrinks from while she opens his eyes to small wonders and experiences which change his impression of her.The key is find which one is most successful. Warm,inciting and sometimes sad.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I don't usually write book reviews because I have a hard time doing it without giving too much away.  I will just say that this book was very engrossing.  It was the kind of book that you hate to put down and try to sneak in extra time throughout the day to finish.  Some books just sit on my nightstand and night after night I read a few obligatory pages just to try and finish it and start my next book.  Me Before You was easy to get into and I flew through it.  The subject matter was unique.  The story really made you think about life and how random it is.  I think both characters were courageous, the dialog was intelligent and I enjoyed the book very much.  I laughed, I cried.  I recommended it to friends.

1451627297|5.0|I have read nearly all of Stephen King's books, starting back in college in the late 70's.  Over the years, I have detected a rhythm to his books that are recognizable enough that I don't like to read them back to back to avoid the repetition.  This book, however, was a delight.  His characters are real enough that they could be your next door neighbors.  Having been alive at the time of the Kennedy assassination, plus the fact that I now live in Dallas, I found the premise fascinating.  No gore, or over-the-top monsters.  Just a great story.  Well done.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A page turner that fascinates, intrigues, grips your attention; characters leave a bitter aftertaste, with author intention.  Cleverly constructed, psychological dual duel drama.
B008220DIC|5.0|Philip Seymour Hoffmann is, arguably, the finest American actor working in films today.  Like Spencer Tracy and Gene Hackman before him, Hoffman has a naturalistic style that allows him to inhabit the character he is portraying, rather than simply giving \\"a performance\\".  With Hoffman, you don't see the wheels turning.  True, the actor may have appeared in some unmemorable movies, but his performances in those pictures have never been less than riveting.<br /><br />THE MASTER is no exception.  Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, this compelling, albeit imperfect film, is set in the early 1950s and casts Hoffman in the title role: a charismatic L. Ron Hubbard-like individual who has created a cult-like belief system, reminiscent of Scientology, that catches on with lost souls who are struggling to find their identities.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix plays a troubled ex-G.I. who has problems adjusting to civilian life.  Much of the film's action is viewed through his distorted perspective.<br /><br /> On the road with no means of support, Phoenix stumbles upon Hoffman's organization, is drawn in and soon becomes his lieutenant, willing to resort to violence in order to protect his mentor.  Phoenix is excellent in the picture's central role, which is, actually, much showier than Hoffman's, yet when the pair share the screen, your eyes go to Hoffman.<br /><br />Also in the cast is Amy Adams, quite effective as Hoffman's cold, pragmatic wife; a role unlike the more perky characters she has played in the past.<br /><br />My problem with THE MASTER is that, in the theatrical version, the purpose and underlying philosophy of \\"The Cause,\\" Hoffman's organization, is never made clear.  Yet, in the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" that are among the extras on the Blu-Ray/DVD combo from Anchor Bay Entertainment, there is a scene in which the philosophy is explained so that the layman viewer can understand it.  It is unfortunate that this scene did not make the final cut in the film itself.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson is a fine filmmaker and, like his earlier works (e.g. THERE WILL BE BLOOD, MAGNOLIA), THE MASTER is involving and enigmatic.  Its convoluted ending will certainly have you asking questions.  Yet, despite these reservations, what makes this movie worth watching are the Oscar-caliber performances by Hoffman, Phoenix and Adams.<br /><br /> Also on the Blu-Ray/DVD is the legendary John Huston documentary, LET THERE BE LIGHT, which dealt with emotionally damaged WW2 veterans and was a strong influence on Anderson in the making of this picture.<br /><br />© Michael B.

It has plenty of power to serve up multiple 1080p video streams with 7.1 audio via PS3 and to also allow streaming from several phones.<br /><br />The only reason that I didn't give this a 5 star rating is because the included fan is very loud and &#34;whines&#34; rather than whirrs.  I'll have to buy an after marked CPU fan as it's just too noisy.

B00008EQ1Z|5.0|The answer to the question what would happen if you locked Keith Richards in a room with some of the best musicians on the planet.  This album sounds as fresh as it did when it was first released and is a PhD lesson in guitar driven rock and roll.  Rockawhile, Make no Mistake, You Don't Move Me and How I Wish are outstanding tracks while Locked Away is on another planet.  This is certainly one of the top five albums released in the 1980s as far as pure musicianship is concerned.  The follow up to this, while not quite up to Talk is Cheap is still worth having in your record collection.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I have the free edition and the only other edition available from Kindle and I would like more! I would upgrade again if it was available to get more words as I see many of the same ones over and over now.  Also, other versions I've seen on friend's have words with more coins available (not just the 1 2 or 3 on here). But the game itself is a ton of fun to play and seems to work well most of the time!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very refreshing and an eye opener. Love how raw it is. Thoroughly enjoyed and can't wait to see the movie now!
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is by far my most listened to album of 2013.  I know it came out a while ago, but I finally picked it up and man am I glad I did!  Macklemore has incredible lyrics and beats.  It is super catchy and the whole album is great.  If you like rap and hip hop at all, I would strongly recommend giving this a try!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Great vinyl edition of all Beatles albums, including original artwork and gorgeous coffee table book in a single box.<br />If you missed your chance to purchase and keep intact first press editions of all Beatles albums, or you can not afford a used &#34;blue box&#34; or MFSL box set - do yourself a favour and buy this collection. You will not be disappointed. I must say, that Abbey Road record really has some out of center pressing defect (almost inaudible), but it is still a good record and great music. Other records are perfect.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I was enjoying this book so much and all of a sudden it was over! I wish it had been longer and that the life of these people had gone into more detail.
B002KS1IJC|2.0|The numerous positive reviews surprise me. Effects are good but acting, story and writing made wife and I exchange yawns and puzzled looks formthe duration. After watching 15 mins, we were worried we could have gotten free on Netflix, it was that bad. You can rely on reviews like we did or choose something else.
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|I've never read a book in my life that I could relate to and learn from more than this book.  It is something I will most likely read 10x over.  Definitely life changing for me.
B00004WPDA|5.0|Great addition to Beatles discography!<br />Vinyl pressing sounds great! Good selection of demos and outtakes from early studio sessions. You will find some really rare stuff here.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love this calculator.  it is very convenient and easy to use.  I would highly recommend this to anyone in need of calculator.  plus its free.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is great. Since it saves the last entry it helps me balance my checking account.<br /><br />Way to go calculator plus free, you rock!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|For the people who don't have this game, you should really get it, it is a great game, well you should at least try it, at least
B00003CXRM|5.0|one of the best movies ever!  we truly enjoy it and watch it often and laugh just as hard each time we see it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOTS OF FUN and ADDICTING!  GREAT for all ages....4yrs and up....Im 40...I love it.......lol DONT HESITATE .....DOWNLOAD IT!  Your kids will love it and so will you.  No problems at all on ky kindlefire either.....downloaded perfect and doesnt freeze or shut down.  Best free game ever
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Loved the app before, &amp; with the new update its even more amazing. one of the best mobile picture editing apps.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Highly addictive, competitive gaming against friends. Excellent graphics and suitable for all ages! Make sure you use the power ups to get a higher score!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|It lived up to the memories I had of when Mrs. Pell, in P.S. 25 Jersey City, read it to us as a treat at the end of the day.  Very fond memories, and a great story The Wonderful Wizard of Oz!
B009RH973I|5.0|Lovely color and quality as expected. It also fits perfectly in my kindle. It was shipped the same they it was ordered, and arrived fast
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book it is better at describing and i love it there were a few difrent things like pettas leg
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Engaging romance that helps you forget where you are. Not too much suspense..you know the right guy gets the girl..but definately leaves you with a warm heart and still believing in true love.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoyed playing Bingo Blitz. It's challenging, but I am able to do better each time. It's a relaxing game while stretching your brain.
B003MAS9S0|3.0|Another mindless superhero type of movie, but enjoyed the costumes, effects and loose storyline. Just easy for a weekend night with the family.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You should try this game. It is so fun. Unlike the first one there is just one gumbo monster and plus you have a choice to stay alive. You should try this asome game.
B0063HBPH6|2.0|I thought there were many caraters that has nothing to do the plot. Just drag-out the story. I also struggle to keep up with all the caracters. I fount four caracter well planned, but the rest was just there. I lost the story plot. Could not understand what one chapter/caracter got to do with the other. There are a fiew funne lines, but not worth reading the whole book.
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Richard Gere is one of my favorites.  Watched this with my girls.  They loved the twists and turns of the plot.
B0045XICB2|4.0|The girls enjoyed this one much better than the first. The original had them laughing with the ridiculous quality of acting and script. This one left them happy they rented it on Amazon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun game. I highly suggest you download this.In my opinion,this game is better than temple run and temple run 2. So if you like temple run this game is for you.
B000NY12LO|3.0|Jodi Picoult does an excellent job in bringing the various perspectives of such a tragedy to light. A good read, in many ways because of the relevance of the subject matter, however not a book I would be inclined to recommend to most and/or read again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I must say I love where this season takes off from. though did not like the wait in the middle of the season! must watch, best zombie film i have seen
B003MXGNX0|3.0|Another mindless superhero type of movie, but enjoyed the costumes, effects and loose storyline. Just easy for a weekend night with the family.
B004J0C2TE|5.0|got interested in this book from a tv show. i like to read novels based on actual events. i haven't read this one yet but plan to. fast shipping. good price.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The entire series deals with living  in a family  Abbey, what is interesting is their view of American vs. English culture. Setting is in the 1912-1920's. Hope they have a Series 4. Each character is carefully developed so it runs from the maid to the Lord of the House, no one is excluded from having a part with deemed importance.. Several subplots collide in a timely manner. You will appreciate the English try wit if you have not experienced it before.
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|An expression of female anger and angst that still holds up over ten years after it's original release. The music is catchy and punchy, and the vocals and lyrics are still powerful and fueled by raw emotion.<br /><br />20 years from now this will STILL be a great album from a talented artist.
6302402824|5.0|thank you so very much . the tape is in great shape and it play very well. thank again for it. ART
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think young players should get this app because it gives info on horses and how to care for them to.
B004LWZW7O|4.0|How would the world be if everyone could be immortal?  Scientists isolate the gene which causes aging, so everyone could live forever.  The only problem?  How do we prevent the world from becoming over-crowded?<br /><br />The answer?  Give each person a finite amount of time.  When it expires, you die, period.  The amount of your life remaining is literally your currency.<br /><br />This leads to an aristocracy of the ultra-wealthy who have more time than they know what to do with (one person has over a million years stored away), literally.  And the desperate poor, who often live with literally hours left to live.<br /><br />The movie's plot begins here, with a very poor man whose mother literally dies in his arms.  An act of kindness towards a drunk, depressed but wealthy man, suddenly leaves him very wealthy, as the man freely gives all of his wealth to the main character.<br /><br />The main character decides to live the good life, but finds the one crime isn't stealing someone else's time (time is transferred by touching arms), but being given some, freely.<br /><br />From here, without giving away too much, the plot basically is \\"newly rich man finds spoiled, beautiful rich man's daughter.  Romance starts.  Newly rich man has riches taken by the Time Police, and him and his beau are now on the run.\\"<br /><br />Basically, the movie takes a very interesting concept and uses it to create a good, if predictable action movie.  It portrays a very believable, detailed world.  I enjoyed watching it and watch it again from time to time.<br /><br />It's not nearly as deep as The Matrix, or destined to become a cult classic (the movie is geared for a mainstream audience) but for a good, futuristic action movie, centered around an interesting concept, this movie delivers a fun experience.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|A friend recommended the show to me.So I watched a video of it on YouTube and fell in love with it. The show represents the LGBT community woo well. It's a great show about the issues with love and family and the world's views on the LGBT community. It shows that we have no hidden agenda that we are just like everybody else just that we like the opposite sex or we like both or we know we were born the wrong sex.
B007ZSE1M8|3.0|Many interviews were done with various indiviiduals....but it was often not clear who the people were or what exactly their relationship with George was.
B0049IWQJW|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family.  My two year old son thoroughly enjoyed it. It was a little long for him, but overall a really cute film.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|It downloaded and installed perfectly, and now, for the first time, this old timer is listening to music on his phone!  Well done, Amazon!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a awesome game but they need to update 0.6.0 on the kindle fire because of armour and baby animal's.
B000SEGSB8|5.0|Judt gives an inside detailed look into the politics that occured in Europe after WW2.  Great read for history/political buffs.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|'Nuff said.  They rock live in concert.  I loved it!  They sing so good live.  It's like listening to them pre-recorded.  All their favorites and classics are on the CD.  If you love Rush, you must get it.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I actually really enjoyed this book. I have seen some of the negative comments have been around this book in terms of editing which I can't really argue with but I enjoyed the plot and how it all ended. I think if your one to get annoyed by typical love stories and poor editing then stay away.
B00973902K|5.0|Miss Carly's song about a hoped for rendezvous is filled with youthful joy and exuberance. It geat to listen to if you ever need to be cheered up.
B00992CF6W|3.0|needs better multiplayer.  it sums because it just screws up and then it lags bad and rodent work and it suks
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Every episode was an unexpected twist. Loved how it ended. I hope there is a third season. I loved that it used the same actors and how different their charactors were from the first series.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|Have read Little Women many times in my life...it is my &#34;go to&#34; book on my Kindle when I want something familiar, something that I find comfort in as I read the familiar tale with the characters I have come to know and love.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|I bought this for my wife.  I don't normally watch animated films but I did watch this one.  I'm a sucker for red hair.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an amazing app! It's a lot better than the first one. The graphics are great. Anyone who doesn't have this app needs to download it!
B007ZUX8CK|5.0|Classic &#34;old time&#34; children' book.  Very nice and slow movng, but cute.  Nice for a child under 5 years old.
B00633W614|4.0|Absolutely loved the first book in this series and found the second story almost as good.  Am sure a third one will follow and am looking forward to it.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I'm officially obsessed with this album. I've been a T&S fan for a long time, and I was a little nervous when I heard they went pop with this album. But it definitely panned out! I love every song!
0812550706|5.0|I had heard that Ender's Game was a kids book from a lot of people, so I had reservations about it until I read it. I'm glad I didn't read it when I was a kid because there are a lot of themes and subtleties that I doubt even some adults would understand. Irregardless read this book, you wont regret it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire so this is a great app for me.  Lots of graphics and ways to play.  Just pick how you want to play.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I did read most of this book.  Much medical jargon and some repetitive text but I got the &#34;jist&#34; of it and have pretty much given up wheat, losing 30 pounds in the process.
B0083VP2KQ|5.0|I purchased this video at a store for a five year old boy that requested to watch it over and over. I then bought a 2nd copy through Amazon and gave it to a six year old girl with the video again becoming a favorite. It is also very easy on adults who consequently have to now see it over and over. The BBC did a fantastic job with the graphics, and they present the material in a similar manner to their &#34;Planet Earth&#34;. The material is fascinating and enlightening as much of it was new to me. It is narrated by John Hurt.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Even funner on my tablet<br />Used to play on my smartphone so definitely needed to download to my tablet hours of fun
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this free calculator app!  We have used it for simple calculations like figuring out the most efficient way to make food on dragon story or calibrating out thermometer that is 1.6 degrees low. Thank you.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|level buttons are non responsive on the kindle fire. tried restarting but level wont launch. this is the only faotd that I have ever had trouble with. all the other button on the screen work.
B000LE16VW|4.0|I have seen this movie many times over the years and I still enjoy it.  I miss Swayze.  Whoopie made me laugh out loud.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Deals with some sensitive marital issues is a helpful and humorous manner.<br />The acting was great and was just fun to watch!
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I was reluctant to spend so much on a product I couldn't try out first... but it's worth every penny! Plug & play, so it was a very easy set-up.  There are 6 buttons that can be programmed for a customized experience.  The features work perfectly.  I purchased this mouse in hopes that it would alleviate some of the pain from carpal tunnel - it makes all the difference in the world!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|This is how to pay tribute to a great show .... With a great dvd set ..... All others pay attention....this is how its done.<br />Multitude of extras.... Hidden gems .... Just all around great
B00AEBB63U|5.0|Great book to read to kids.  Always enjoyed and just the right length.  The pictures are a lot of fun too.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I had fun playing this game with my 7 year old daughter, yes it is made of cheap plastic but it has not broken.  It takes some time and skill to build but the building is almost as much fun as knocking it down and yes it also takes about as much luck as skill to knock the things down but it is fun.  And for the price was well worth it.
B004RL9T50|5.0|This is a great movie. The only caveat to my rating is that this super-hero movie does not have a clear Good vs Evil theme. Therefore, younger kids may not understand the &#34;evil&#34;-turns-good concept. Great for older kids and adults who are looking for good, clean, hilarious fun. Highly quotable!
B003R0LBVW|2.0|Franzen is obviously paid by the word.  There is so much extraneous information in this novel that he might as well have thrown in the kitchen sink.  There were too many characters to adequately develop, and the reader was left without investing in any one of them.  The book lost cohesion.  I also found that there was an arrogance to his writing.  He was more impressed with letting the reader know was well versed in mining, birds, and spare parts for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan than writing a compelling novel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I selected this game because a friend suggested it to me and now I play it every time I turn on my kindle. It's so addicting. I don't even care if it has an ending. I just like playing all the challenges and trying to get all the characters.
0345803493|5.0|Love it all.  Ana is smart and Christian is romantic. Best love story.<br />Does it deserve a Nobel prize of literature?  Most likely not.<br />But then again there is something about it that is so appealing to some of us. It is not only the sex, It is the dream that the romantic hero is there somewhere around the corner.  Oh. That is right. Back to reality. Or perhaps I will read it once more.<br />Amazing achievement for EL.James. Well done!!!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app lets you download any music video. It has every new video on it and lets you download it
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is a quick-read thriller.  Initially it seemed to portray the normal trail of the breakdown of a marriage, the mis-communication etc that can lead to estrangement.  It was interesting to see how the characters both felt when they realized they could recoup their relationship. The author was clever in offering both spouses points of view.  However, the ending did not do justice the rest of the novel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I usually only read on the commute to and from work. But this book had me reading at the gym, at home, and on my lunch break!
030758836X|3.0|I  enjoyed reading this book.  It was for our book club.  But I wouldn't rate it any higher, or to be on the NY best seller list for as long as it was.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put this down!  Now I need the rest....too many books on my &#34;to be read&#34; list but the Silo Saga is right at the front.
1609611543|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know why they get fat.  It reviews the history of wheat, its hybridization and the results that make wheat problematic to anyone who wants to be healthy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 7 year old son and his friends could play this app forever.  He LOVES it - both the creative mode and the other mode with zombies and creepers, etc.  He builds things and collects things.  I can't say I understand the game, but he enjoys it.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This movie was so welled acted by Mery Streep and Clint Eastwood.  They captured the passion of meeting and letting go.  Very emotional.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very similiar to Shades of Grey. If you like that one you'll like this one. I thought it was worth reading.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is a very readable summary of the technical information included in Good Calories, Bad Calories, which contrasts good nutrition science with the popular hypotheses of politically correct dogma.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Watching the movie on my kindle fire was awesome - like my own private movie theatre.  I loved the book, so I had high expectations.  The movie helped me visualize some things (like the town) but let me down in other ways (ie: the capital and it's inhabitants weren't as glitzy as I had imaged).  The casting was really good.  They had some great special effects.  They changed aspects of the book that I had issues with, but I guess that will happen anytime you put a book onto the big screen.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie and look forward to the next two.
B001OMJGD0|2.0|You have to love classic Superman. We had been building up what an awesome superhero Superman is to our kids, but this was a movie night flop. In their words &#34;He didn't even fight!&#34; This movie was a melodramatic disaster and a disgrace to Superman movies.
0670026603|4.0|If you are feeling blue about your own relationship this is the book for you!<br />Quirky characters, seemingly insurmountable problems and a warm entertaining story  make this book rewarding and emotionally fulfilling. A friend told me to read it with a box of Kleenex next to me and I would give perspective readers the same advice. Being an  American reader I enjoyed the dialogue of Lou and her  working class family and friends. Lou's relationship with her family is fun and often quite hilarious.<br />Others have described the plot so I will just say the plot was cohesive and well written. The author's use of multiple view points was well done.<br /><br />Warning! If you don't have time to read wait until you do as this one is hard to put down!
B0079R8KO0|2.0|Item did not fit Kindle, although it says it was for that model.  i WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED  THAT ITEM DID NOT FIT.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the Hunger Games.  I couldn't put it down.  Once I finished that book, I immediately downloaded Catching Fire to continue with the triology.  It was equally as amazing as Hunger Games.  She is a great writer who knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Classic Steve McQueen.  Best car chase ever.  A must see.  Great to see San Francisco in good times past.  Lots of scenes of the city.
0812982622|5.0|The book starts a little slowly but evolves into a fantastic journey, that along the way, communicates a sense of how irrational life in North Korea must be. There are scenes and characters that will stay with you well after you've finished the book. Very satisfying. I recommend also reading  Escape from Camp 14 sometime after you get a chance to read this book. Orphan Master's Son captures many of the horrors experienced by the writer of Escape from Camp 14, but places them within the context of a wildly imaginative storyline that makes for engaging, and thought-provoking reading.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I have been playing this type of bubble burst game on other devices for years. It's  a great time waster. I wold recomemt it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It is more difficult to use than on a pc.  I can't always see all of the older posts.  Adding comments isn't that easy.  I don't like using FB on my kindle fire.  I'd rather use it on a pc.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Absolutely loooove  it! I am always at the beach and that is perfect, i don't need to be concerned about watering my cell phone. Perfect.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Typical Sparks...he always has depth & few twists.  Always keeps you involved to the last word & wishing you could really meet these people.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read a ton of books and this is one of the best I have ever read. Its full of heartfelt moments and it hits every emotion. Its written beautifully!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that I can access my Kindle books from any of my devices -- Kindle reader, tablet or phone.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Went to watch it with low expectations having seen the 1995 version. Everything fits together well in this version, cinematography, music and the acting! Karl Urban does a good Dredd in my opinion and Olivia Thirlby does great as Anderson as well! Lena Headey plays a great villain in the film.
B0096BIENY|5.0|IL DIVO is truly and simply AMAZING. They have some of the best voices I have ever heard in my life. I listen to everything from Classical to Old Country to Classic Rock right on to Heavy Metal, I have a very wide range of tastes in music but listening to IL DIVO blows me away these guys are just as I said before SIMPLY AMAZING!!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Appealing main character, familiarity with and commitment to dealing in a sensitive manner with a flawed system carried me through this transformative story.  Grace of prose make me keep it.
1844256383|5.0|Very nice book. Full of great ideas for taking care of your saxaphone. Lots of pictures and details. Even if you do not want to do major repairs there are a lot of info on the easy jobs
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Although somewhat unbelievable, Harold Fry's pilgrimage was inspiring; he helped many along the way without even realizing his impact.  His relationship with his wife and son saddened me, and I really never saw the resolution of those relationships coming.  There were many hints that kept me reading--reference to the woman he betrayed and his estrangement from his son, David.  The life of one so seemingly ordinary can be extraordinary!
B0098460O4|5.0|These 2 young singers are going to have a Wonderful Singing Career ahead of them. Their voices complement each other so well and to listen to them you would never think such powerful voices could come out of such young people. When they open their mouths it's as if Total Beauty is escaping their lips. Truly Wonderful.
B00000J2SO|5.0|My son wanted it for Christmas - so he got it. I have no idea what is is so I can't really review it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A beautiful story told from the view of a faithful companion. I'm not a racing fan but enjoyed this book very much for its human and canine qualities!
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I enjoyed how dark & mature this was very unpredictable portrayal of the joker & also batman that you only read in the comics & rarely in animation. I hope to see more portrayal of batman stories of this element in the future who knows maybe even a series i believe would do great.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Some major blindsides you just don't plan on but it wouldn't be House if that didn't happen. Some great laughs a few tear jerking moments and a Truly Wonderful and Amazing End to The Series. AAA+++
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|I love Andrea Bocelli. I can listen to him anytime anywhere. I can't understand the words much of the time but I don't care. BEAUTIFUL!
0060555661|4.0|Although the book is in great shape i was expecting the red cover! The version i got was a pale blue color! However no biggie! And great job!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Very funny and entertaining. Good little love story too. My boyfriend watched it with me and even he liked it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great story, enjoyed reading this, author does a great job of explaining his story.  This book will definitely inspire you.
B005IQZB14|4.0|The tale of one woman's journey of self-discovery and healing on a solo hike along the Pacific Crest Trail. Cheryl's descriptions of what it's like to be on the trail backpacking is spot on. Interspersed with tales of her pain and growth around the death of her mother, I always found the book engaging and difficult to put down. A fairly quick read, I'd recommend it.
B000W93CHC|4.0|This is a great book by all accounts, the only negative being that it is not as good as The Pillars of The Earth, which is an awsome book. Word Without End has the same type of narrative, keeps your eyes glued to the Kindle and keeps you wake at night reading when you should be sleeping. It can be a little too long though. Anyway, I recomment it to anyone, especially if you are into medieval fiction, such as The Pillars of The Earth or The Physician by Noah Gordon.
B00797MB0O|5.0|I think the hardest part of this story is how realistic it is. People who are looking for Hollywood big studio entertainment will not find it here. This is the most painful parts of adolescence regurgitated and analyzed. Maven's return to her hometown is as pitiful as it is endearing. You love and hate her. You love her because she is so desperate to be loved and find happiness. But you hate her because she wouldn't give you the time of day when you knew her in school. Everyone has a story; this is hers.<br /><br />Every actor here is spot on. There are no weak performances from powerhouse Charlize's Maven to Collette's enabling Sandra. Heavy weights Mary Beth Hurt and Jill Eikenberry nail it too. And by the way Hettienne Park, where have you been?! Can't wait for you to rock some larger roles in the future. Patton Oswald is even more charming than he was in United States of Tara and Patrick Wilson... oh Patrick Wilson. I keep expecting a crap performance from you. But this performance was so subtle and sweet. If only all exboyfriends were such gentlemen.
B00785P2QC|5.0|if you like to create your own towns then you should get this game ireally like it and i am sure you will too.  Enjoy this while you can
B000002L7Y|5.0|I never knew this group but loved their music! So glad I bought this CD!I have already played it several times!!
B00170I7GG|5.0|One of the best movies ever! So clever. It is fast becoming a classic. Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are great.
067165991X|5.0|Love the book! I love Diplomacy, I dont agree with Kissinger in many of his points of view, anyway this book is a must for people who want to learn the new world order.
B003TXSF5C|2.0|This reads like a cosmology course overview... and barely. I'd recommend ANYTHING by Brian Greene over this if you want any &#34;meat and potatoes&#34; with your physics.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I was disappointed by \\"The Litigators\\" and totally captivated by \\"The Confession\\" so when I got to read \\"The Racketeer\\" I wasn't sure what to expect. Would I wish for the hours back that I spent reading it? Would I be sad when it was over and want more??<br /><br />Turns out it was the latter. (Yay for me!) \\"The Racketeer\\" was suspenseful, funny, thought-provoking, and a real page-turner. There were great twists and turns, but no so many that you couldn't keep up with what was going on.
