B001QJUX24|2.0|I expected more from a &#34;So Called Classic&#34;.  This was billed as the template for all modern westerns and it was<br />far from it.
0345529057|2.0|I understand that many people like this series, but i got sick of it toward the end of the third book.  I'm done.  I will not read the fourth.<br /><br />I found it horribly violent and degrading to sexuality and women, but the story was interesting.  However, I just got fed up with all the characters being killed off and the author's interest in plot twists only for the sake of suprising or horrifying the reader.  I like stories that give the reader someone to root for.
B00BHBBSZ2|2.0|Instead of having on continuous line that one can write on the user is given three lines to write on when prompted to write. As such, all writing comes out in 'blocks' rather than line by line. Unless I'm using it incorrectly, I find this highly annoying.<br /><br />The interface isn't very clear on how to properly size your font as well as the thickness of the writing. Instructions are not very clear.<br /><br />I do like however how I can create a notebooks for bundling certain documents and notes and how I can export my data as a .png<br /><br />Am contemplating finding another writing app that is more user friendly and has better formatting.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Interesting movie plot. The acting is good and resembles other good future pieces. It shows how extremes in ANY laws just cause more harm or deny our very existance.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new layout is annoying and point driving. I use the weather channel ap to get the weather, not to watch videos or collect points by filling out surveys. It needs a basic feature that lets you use the previous layout that was easier to use and much more aesthetically pleasing.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|I love Transformers this movie was great and it plays perfectly on my kindle HD...Thanks Amazon<br />Will watch again Love it
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very interesting story format.  It is broken down into reports/interviews about the zombie uprising.  The format makes it perfect to read while commuting.
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|I thought this suit could not surpass the Kite Runner or even equal it. But he did. I could not put it down.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Completely different than the other angry birds, yet still with the same great fun and feel. Works great and is a blast!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Loved it wish I could get more but I guess the show has ended :o(......... oh well enjoyed what was available, actually liked it better than the game of thrones!
B008XG1X18|3.0|This is a wonderful and fun tool, but I cannot pin from the internet (I use a Fire). I pin an item, and it says \\"loading\\" but then I can't find it anywhere. Very frustrating and really limits what you can do with this app.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|The game seems like it would be fun except I can figure out how to get out of the practice zone there are no options to move on iI have made all 3 stars in each setting and still nothing.. I really would like to play the game I love the spins they have
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I have been playing magic for a while before  I got this app an  me  me tell you, this is a good game for magic. The game plays smoothly and the difficulty in the game is set by your answer when it asks you how Lon  you have been playing magic. The only thing I don't like is the way you unlock cards for your story mode deck. I would have  preferred it if that was different, but that is my only complaint on this game.
6305265666|5.0|Love this movie. I watch it over, and over, and never tire of it, which is rare for me. I even have my best guy friend watching it with me sometimes. I still even cry at the sentimental parts. Ever After - A Cinderella Story makes a fairytale come true, making you see where everything really could happen to someone, making you believe dreams can come true. Very realistic, evil step-mother and step-sister (one is actually nice in this), Cinderella (Drew Barrymore), and the ohhh sooo way too good looking for a man Prince Charming (Dougray Scott), all do a great job in this fairytale romance come true.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Ever since I got my Kindle, I've been thinking of getting something like this. Recently I flew from Boston to Pittsburg, & saw alot of people using simular items for their Ereaders, so that convinced me to get one for myself. I like mine very much, wish had gotten one sooner. Very easy to use, plus it will protect my Kindle Fire.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Nice case I just wisht the pock was switch to horizontal  like my old case but everything else is great. I've gotten several compliments from my coworkers and friends
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I can't say that I would rave about this book the way I have about others, but it was decent. I enjoyed reading it but I think I had higher expectations than the book delivered.
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|slow boring repetitive good for kids under 6 who don't know any better or adults who never grew up period
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Two very good games. If you enjoy video games you have to play these. They are from the last console generation(ps2), but this remastered edition for ps3 it's just beautiful, very much worth playing.
B000003EPN|5.0|What a glorious cast... This is as great a recording as you are likely to find of RIGOLETTO.<br /><br />A keeper.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|definitely not what i expected very creative twist on honest abe. it was ok i don't watch it over and over, but once in awhile for something a bit different it's ok
B008Y729FU|2.0|I'm not sure if this movie was this cheesy when it was released or if it just aged poorly.when i watched this movie the second time around i was surprised at how bad it was.i guess some memories are better left untouched.
B000TEMS3O|5.0|I purchased all their albums on amazon and enjoyed each one, this is my fav of all the albums. silo78
B00BHMETKC|4.0|When time flies it's a good movie and the writing was at a great tempo through out the movie,good job
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I don't need to say much more. Pretty much anything he does(related to music) is very good, I love his voice. From all of  the pop singer nowadays he is the best one in my humble opinion.
B000SXMSJ0|4.0|A few of the songs are fantastic, some of them are a bit &#34;blah&#34; but for the most part it's a must have album. It's relaxing to listen to and the lyrics are beautiful.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|even my daughter loves this movie which i honestly didn't expect. it's really a great movie and very creative. keeps you wanting to watch it and wanting to know what the next one will be. i really hope they never change the cast this one is amazing for their roles and i just thoroughly enjoy this movie as well as my family
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Reminds me of the &#34;wheel of time&#34; by jordan and of the &#34;confessor&#34; books. Also reminiscent of the &#34;Amber&#34; book by Zelasny. Good show!
B008MM9630|5.0|I love this game. I love how it independent up to a certain point. My favorite tree is the sakura tree. I really love this game and i think everybody should get it
8866135909|3.0|I needed to return it.  I think in the interest of cost savings, Moleskin deleted the monthly pages which for me are the most valuable, I need an overview of my schedule given I work odd days.  I will order the 2014 annual monthly diary instead when it is released.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Do not waste your time.  Morose and not enjoyable.  Really bad ending.  You will be sorry you wasted your kindle space.
1586638491|5.0|I loved having the original and modern texts side by side. I actually understood and enjoyed this book. My professors even approve of these editions as they are super accurate.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is great for the family I really enjoy this one and so does my daughter. The 2nd one was highly inappropriate in the way it was delivered. It was definitely not one I'll be buying or watching again, nor my child. But this one was good
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Makes you use your noggin'.  Good time waster without letting you totally veg out. Keeps you fairly alert but not stressed out.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I was skeptical but that quickly disappeared after the movie started.  Great actions scenes and what a cast!  John Malkovich is priceless in this movie.  And of course Bruce, Helen and Morgan are at their coolest and best.  I can't wait to see it again!
1932100660|5.0|This is an amazing book if you are the least bit concerned about your health.  It made me rethink my eating habits!
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Sometimes you need a place to make notes on the go. ColorNote gives you what you need. The bells and whistles aren't necessary, and it does the job.
B005LAIII0|4.0|The visuals are some of the best you will find, and on BluRay they are even better! The story is interesting, but it is very drawn out and long at parts. You will even probably find yourself asking what the ending of the movie really means. I won't say one way or the other about it, but it is an exciting story at parts, and at others it's drab.
B004CUVRF6|5.0|Love this movie! It is creative, sends a good message and keeps you wanting to watch it. Great family movie
B00B0A5XQU|5.0|Love her stories, you can actually feel like you know the characters in the book and you want to visit them again.
B00340LM8C|5.0|The location made the movie. Monaco with it`s ageless beauty. Cary Grant, the iconic star,looks old to play such an atheletic part but he was his usual good. Grace Kelley was a beauty but her acting was not strong.
B00A3XWB10|4.0|I'd like to offer this challenge to American rock bands.  Make an album that beats this album.  I'd be willing to bet very few of these bands actually could.  Well there are some metal bands that could compete but otherwise, just speaking of straight up hard rock Tesla is probably the only good band still around, that I can think of right now anyways.  There's probably more I'm forgetting.<br /><br />OK so a couple years ago I saw a top 20 list of rock albums of 2010.  As a fan of rock and metal music living in the states, radio is absolute crap, I've become accustomed to having to dig for new music.  Wow, to my surprise I discovered this little band, with their previous album Generation Wild, which was pretty decent, but did have a couple songs I wasn't big into.  I also discovered bands like Jetblack, Hardcore Superstar, Crazy Lixx, and Reckless Love, all of which are solid bands.<br /><br />So I'm not a fan who's been there since the beginning, but I do love a good hard rock album, and this delivers.  There are so few albums which contain as many songs for me to look forward to hearing as this one.  Seriously there are at least 5 songs I look forward to hearing every time, and only 1 I didn't like, the rest being pretty good.<br /><br />Overall this album sounds pretty solid.  I don't notice any horrible production issues that kept Queensryche's new album, self titled, from competing with this for favorite album of 13.  Overall I can hear every instrument and the vocals all just fine.<br /><br />The musicianship isn't anything fancy, so nothing like Rush or Dream Theater here, but it's solid for this type of music, and they all do a good job, as does the vocalist.<br /><br />Change The World 9/10 not a big fan of the intro, but it does transition nicely into the actual song.  This one's a mid tempo rocker with a faster chorus.  I love the vocals, and pretty much everything about this song is solid.<br /><br />Cocaine Cowboys 10/10 starts with an acoustic bit before becoming an up tempo fun rocker.  I love the pacing, the beat and the vocals on this one and everything fits very well.<br /><br />Anarchy 9/10 has an opening riff that reminds me of part of a Bruce Dickinson song from Accident of birth, but I can't remember the name of it.  Overall this is another up tempo rocker with nice melody and a fun chorus, although a bit repetitive it's yet another song I look forward to everytime I listen to this album.<br /><br />California 8/10 is yet another up tempo rocker.  Again I like everything about this song, but not quite as much as the previous 3.<br /><br />Lickin dog or whatever 2/10 I didn't care for this song.  Musically and vocally it was probably fine I just remember hating the lyrics, and only listened to it a couple times before giving up on it, thus I don't remember it.<br /><br />Circus 10/10 is one of the faster songs on here, again a rocker.  I love the opening riff and again the melody is really catchy.  I'm a sucker for a catchy chorus, but thankfully this song offers more than just that.<br /><br />Sin City 7/10 is a decent rocker.  It's a bit repetitive and not quite as fun as the previous songs, I like, but it's still a pretty solid track.  Is he saying \\"Drink to self pitty?\\".<br /><br />Got A Reason 8/10 is a pretty good rocker.  Again like everything.<br /><br />Drinking Without You 9/10 One of the closest things to a love ballad on here, which is still a rocker.  It's a fast paced song.  Again like everything, yadda yadda get this album already..<br /><br />Snakes In Paradise 7/10 is another pretty good rocker.  I like the tone to this song.  The verses remind me of another song, but I can't think of which one.  I try and end up thinking of Motley Crue's Saints Of Los Angeles, but I'm pretty sure that isn't the song I was originally thinking of.<br /><br />Damaged Kid 7/10 is a decent rocker, a little more depressing lyrics.  I'm still letting this one grow on me as I don't know these songs as well at theend, but it's pretty good.<br /><br />Excited 6/10 is actually the closest thing to a love ballad on here.  It's the softest song on here, but it's ok I guess.  This is probably my least favorite song except the one i don't like.  It's still decent enough though.<br /><br />Garden Of Babylon 7/10 is an ok song.  They get a little more proggy as this song exceeds 7 minutes, and it's a pretty good song.  Again I'm letting this one still grow on me a bit.<br /><br />Liquid Jesus 7/10  is a fun rocker and ends the album nicely.  I'm not real big into the section with the organ, though it does fit what they were going for.  I appreciate trying something different, but for some reason it doesn't really do it for me, hence I knocked off a point.  But it's still a fun song talking about how beer is essentially his religion.<br /><br />Overall this will likely be my favorite album of 2013.  I can't imagine any album coming out that will have this many good songs, much less the great ones.  If you're a fan of the band I'd definitely recommend this, and if you haven't heard these guys yet, but like hard rock bands like Motley Crue, Skid row, Tesla, or Ratt, then you should definitely give these guys a listen.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|This is not for you if you want to take pictures of friends or places.  With this back facing camera, you can only Skype or take pictures of yourself
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie is brilliant! No doubt about that! The vocals are fantastic and unedited which makes it even cooler. The movie is a long one and may be hard to sit through for some, but I enjoyed every second of it. You won't find a bigger cast of talent in any other movie like this for a long time. I am very impressed.
B0037WP83M|5.0|i love all these they are very creative and keep you wanting to watch them to find out what happens next they're just an overall great movie
B000001E21|5.0|Great album this needs to be in anyones def leppard collection. Lots of great songs on this album would recommend album to others
0312330537|5.0|I love this book so much I've read it twice. Can't say that about any other books which are nearly a 1000 pages long!
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I love the idea of old Celtic magic and current times combined into this book. It can read a bit choppy in places, but because there is so much going on in this book, it actually added to the charm of the story instead of hindering it! If you are on the fence, try the sample for Kindle but I think you'd be hooked too when you read it!
B004VOBIE8|2.0|It can't even find all of my files. I have pictures on my phone that I can view but this file manager can't find to delete. enough said. BTW. the files are on my SD card and I put the SD card into my PC Card Reader. Found the files and deleted them
B004SIP7QC|5.0|The story is magnificent and the visuals are even better. The characters are very well developed and this is one movie that I will watch over and over. It's super cheap to be on BluRay, but well worth the money!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|PBS  has outdone itself with this series. Have a friend going  to a Downton Abbey Party. Proper Dress required. This series is all the buzz. Look out Holloween party. This will be the costume to have. What a wonderful show.
0743497465|5.0|Haven't finished reading the book yet, but I know it'll be another Brown masterpiece! Looking forward to finding the time to finish!
B000000XB9|5.0|I bought this cd for my daughter.  She really likes it.  We listen to it all the time.  The best part is it is on my iphone.  I highly recommend this cd,
B0063IH60K|4.0|About as good as solitaire gets. Simple, direct, quick.<br />It does exactly what it is supposed to do. What more could you ask for?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Wow my whole family loves this game. From ages 3 to 99, it is fun for all!!!!<br />It is so fun and addicting!!!!
B0013ND30M|5.0|Got this item within one week. Very good quality, can play without issue on my daughter's portable DVD player. Very satisfied with this product and seller. Thanks!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Watched it while on vacation at the beach. Now kids are hooked. Everything about the show is great. I have said it all. Thank you
B005PK1G76|5.0|Fits stroller very well and a plus is its slightly insulated.  It was exactly what I needed for my trip!  The sturdy velcro straps are long enough to fit almost any umbrella stroller I would imagine!
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Bought this for my son on his birthday.  He loves this series of movies.  I don't mind watching them with him as they are pretty funny.
B008602KQI|4.0|I liked the  movie, but I liked the book much better. And I'm glad I read the book first so I had a better understanding of what was going on.
B00006OA8C|2.0|Bought this album from a third party: importcds<br /><br />What's Going On is one of the greatest albums ever in my opinion.  My two star rating has nothing to do with the content of the album, but the vinyl itself.  One thing I have never liked about buying records off Amazon is that you have no idea what you are getting.  I buy vinyls from other websites, and they tell you exactly what kind of vinyl it is.  Such as whether it is an 180 gram audiophile or a vinyl reissue (which has the possibility of being lower in quality).  This vinyl is probably one of the worst in sound quality I have ever purchased.  The volume level of the LP as a whole is terrible.  I have to crank the volume up just hear it at a reasonable volume.  Also, the 'instrumental' volume levels are much lower than they should be.  The production on this album is amazing, but you can barely hear it over the vocals.  Essentially, there is not a good balance between the volume of the production and vocals, and overall volume level of the vinyl is very low.  I would only buy this album if you can guarantee a 180 gram audiophile.  Otherwise you are wasting your money on a low quality vinyl.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. Its really cute. You get to be a minion and compete to be minion of the year.
1409136612|4.0|Big Maeve Binchy fan.  Quick read, pleasant story.  Enjoyed the book and the large print, so purchased a second copy as a gift for someone who has vision problems.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun app for kids or adults wanting to kill some time. My little girl loves it!! Simple to use and great fir kids of all ages.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|This is more like it! I feel like I'm reading classic reichs! A little heavy on the tech but not as bad as some have been. Still my favorite series!
B004J09ONG|5.0|My husband and I just watched this wonderful movie with our grandkids who are 8 and 5.  I loved it as a child (I was 12 when it was released in 1966) and I loved it just as much last weekend!  The kids really enjoyed it too.  A classic that has endured!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I loved watching this movie also it was full of adventure and action, I would recommend this movie to everyone. It was great
B003ITZBW2|5.0|I specifically bought the two disc version cuz I'm a special features kind of guy. It's easily a top 5 Batman animated movie.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun to play! Love that it is free. Just wish gift requests from friends were viewable without going to their fb page. Otherwise great app for Kindle.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Amazing, that's all I can say. Finished this book in less than eight hours. Couldn't put it down. Love the story, the characters, and the authors way with words. I was hooked from page one. Can't wait to start reading book two.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun and challenging game. Played every level in one sitting, I just couldn't stop playing. Need to add more levels.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is a delightful movie.  How they were able to make this so real is beyond me!  I highly recommend it
B007WFR0QS|5.0|we finally get to hear talent here she has been burning up in europe and writing for everyone. now we here her soul and spirit on her own album with her own voice.
0767903854|4.0|After reading Bryson's African Diary, I had to continue on with this offering on the Australian state of affairs. If you only looked at the bibliography contained at the back of this 307 page book, you might suspect that this was part of a college course on Aussie history; partly correct. Humor and pithy observation is all apart of Bill Bryson and his travels rendered into book form. You will come away from this excellent read with a better understanding of our &#34;Down Under&#34; allies, friends and their culture. An easy way to be entertained while gathering your Australian education with a wonderful sightseeing tour to boot. (Hard  Cover ed.)
B001HBYHFA|3.0|This was based on Firefly, but there were definitely some changes to create a movie.  The most notable was that there was a lot more unnecessary violence and the plot was much darker than the show.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Love this entire story.  Very happy it was able to be brought to a fantastic conclusion with Sanderson's help<br />I recommend this to anyone.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Tom did an excellent job! There isn't a single song on here that I don't like. Hoping he'll come to FL on tour
B009AMANBA|4.0|A really different insight into Abraham Lincoln.  Not sure I like the way he was portrayed but it is worth seeing.<br />Go for it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|For folks who have taken the time to actually read and study the bible and are confused by it this is the book that explains what is  going on in the New Testament and the Hebrew scriptures.  I am not a professional theologian but I am widely read in the theology and the history of the times in which Jesus lived.  I heard the author on an NPR interview state that he was raised in the traditional Christian background but his study of scripture led him along another path.  For people confused about Jesus as Christ and Jesus as Man who are unsatisfied with the Christian church's answer this is the book to read.
B00CA4S3UI|4.0|If you're a fan of Karlsson than this will be a 'must buy' but I'm not so sure if the same is true for others that are not, fans that is.  I bought this CD mostly for the vocal talents that lend their time to it; how can you go wrong with the likes of Allen, Harnell, Readman, and Boals right?  I was very surprised by Karlsson's vocal talents as well - the guy sounds great, sheesh, remember when Ynwgie started trying to sing! I gave it 4 stars because of the commonalities in Karlsson's writing style - which you really can't fault him for, but I would have liked more variation in the use of instruments, tones, and cadences. I found it very similar to The Battle... and why didn't Jorn sing on this project? that would've been really great. The guitar is mixed a little too forward and a bit hotter than I like, but other than that - it's a fine effort.
B009U9S6FI|4.0|This book gave me a better understanding of the life experiences of a holocaust victim.  How the survival mode kicks in and the long term effects of trauma on the psyche.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is the best movie ever especially if you have  been incarcerated before because it is real and raw when it comes to the need of hope in prison and becoming institutionalized.
B0063IH60K|5.0|People seem to be  asking &amp; searching for ways to strengthen their mind... Well this game will do just that! This game is fun and intreguing!!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love this show.  It is one of those comedy's that is actually clean enough that the kids and Grandparents can watch.  Sure they have a few bedroom scenes but they racy and very long .  Love Love Love it.
0307474259|5.0|This is the definitive book on losing weight.  I have lost over fifty pounds and kept it off for over a year and half.  The author makes it quite clear what triggers the fat storing mechanism in our bodies.  He writes in language that laymen can understand.  I give this book to family members who are having weight control problems.  There is a companion book with it that is longer and more technical but this book is written in such a way that it inspires changing your eating habits and keeping the changes.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who has tried repeated diets and has been unsuccessful.  It is also a good book to buy and give to your physician.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hate the new update. It sucks ~graphics are toooo busy.Liked the old version much. better easier to navagate.What are the points about? Want weather not play games.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Jack Teacher got to do it all this time around: sex, weapons, international travel and killing the bad guys.  A good book that keeps the interest peaked and the pages turning.
B001395L06|5.0|I loved this movie and finally decided to purchase it to download to my computer. I love when Denzel is bad. I think that is him at his best. He is suave even as a bad guy. American Gangster was a wonderful movie. It showed how crazy the drug world is and every cop may not be as good as they seem. I rooted for Frank at times , and turn around and rooted for Richie as well. I was really torn, but that was the fun of the movie.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Haven't watch this one yet but I know it is going to be great.  Sheldon is such a hoot with his dry wit.  Poor Raj is he ever going to be able to talk to girls before becomes an alcoholic?  Can't wait to watch and see.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|My family and I totally enjoyed the movie, although a bit long.  It was highly entertaining and contained a number of memorable lines.  We love this series of movies.
0670023329|5.0|This was at times very difficult to read, but so compelling I couldn't put it down.  EVERYONE needs to read this book to find out just what it is like in this desolate country.  I was appalled at how this disgraceful regime could oppress their own people.  It is only by the grace of God that he was able to escape and tell the world of his horror, and I pray that God will wield His mighty power to rid this country of their horrible dictator and free them to be able to live a life of dignity and promise.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|I thought this was an excellent book. Couldn't put it down. Had lots of twists and turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Awesome little charger. This is obviously a well built product when you feel it. Charges my HTC One very quickly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is very good for passing time I play it all the time Haha lots of different styles of games you can find a game for everyone
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Yes, I read the book first.  I read the book years ago and it to this day it remains one of my favorite books of all time.  When I heard it was going to be made into a live action movie I was very excited!  If you're expecting to see an exact replica of the book on the big screen, you're in for a disappointment.  The book itself is a sort of anthology, and putting an anthology on the big screen is hard to do in a two hour block.  That is unless you're making &#34;Creep Show&#34;<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Brad Pitt does an excellent job acting and the character he plays is relatable and interesting and through the entire movie you're rooting for him to make it out alive and get home safe to his family.<br /><br />If you look closely in the movie you'll see subtle references to the book &#34;The Zombie Survival Guide&#34; that Max Brooks wrote before he did World War Z.  Like when the doctor holds up an ax and a baseball bat and says &#34;Both has it's merits.&#34;  There are also references to the book World War Z, like the guy in Israel who talked about the 10th person disagreeing with the other nine because it was his duty.<br /><br />The overall story was good, but there were a few things I didn't like.  Such as making the zombies running zombies and having them shrieking like creatures from another planet.  What was wrong with just making them moan?  They moaned in the book and people loved the book, why fix what isn't broke?  Plus, twelve seconds to turn?  In the Zombie Survival Guide they stated that from bite to reanimation it took a full thirty hours.  But then again I guess that wouldn't make for a very thrilling action movie.<br /><br />Also I was really hoping to see the Battle of Yonkers and the Battle of New Hope.  They were in the book and if you ask me they were the two most interesting parts of the novel.  Plus the movie doesn't really end, it just kind of stopped.  Like they ran out of story and just threw a voice-over in and called it a day.<br /><br />Plus why didn't Brad Pitt just tell his UN buddy what his idea was and then that way they could try his idea out at a facility that wasn't half overrun with zombies?  Not to mention, no one else thought of this idea?  Not a doctor, not a biologist, not a virologist, no it was this guy, a former war correspondent.<br /><br />Moving right along, the Israelis know that the zombies exist and they know they are dangerous.  But they didn't know that noise attracts them?  This didn't come up during the construction of that huge wall?  While running those massive construction machines, they  didn't attract any zombies at all?<br /><br />On top of that there is no way on Earth that the zombies would be able to climb/stack up like they did and get over that wall.  Not to mention that when they fell over the side of the wall that the resulting impact would shatter like every bone in their bodies!  They wouldn't have been a threat to anyone!<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />There are just a bunch of parts of this movie that don't make sense, but there are a few parts of the movie that are pretty good and they make it worth checking out.  If you are a huge fan of the book, you may be disappointed, but if you're looking for an action zombie movie, you'll enjoy this one.'t Brad Pitt just tell his UN buddy what his idea was and then that way they could try his idea out at a facility that wasn't half overrun with zombies?

B005OT2YVA|4.0|Lots of action...similar to all the other Transformer movies.  Good CGI...nicely done.  Recommended, if you like this type of movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|On top of being down right cute, this game is surprisingly entertaining and challenging, even for older kids!The graphics are cool and the game music is great as well. Although the game play is simple, it does not ge tiring like other games. From launching pads to rockets and unicorns, this game offers many hours of enjoyment for the whole family!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|GREAT SHOW!! NO PROBLEMS WITH VIEWING IT. LOVE AMAZON &#60;3 WOULD RECCOMEND AMAZON MOVIES AND SHOWS TO ANYONE NOT WANTING TO WAIT FOR NETFLIX
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you are a fan you will be hooked on season 3!  Get it now...Can't stop watching it.  If there is a season 4 put it on my list!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|transfers to different devices w/o loosing my stored times and information. like can choose which type of mp3 to set the alarm to than a standardized manufacture tune.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Love theses types of games. Keeps you wanting more to keep  you playing. Hope more games like this come out for Kindle.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|season 3 keeps the questions coming, you never know what to expect other than people almost always do the opposite/have ulterior motives than what they say
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Love it! Perfect movie for the holidays. Can watch again and again. Will Smith rocks! Would recommend for the whole family.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|GREAT SHOW!! NO PROBLEMS WITH VIEWING IT. LOVE AMAZON &#60;3 WOULD RECCOMEND AMAZON MOVIES AND SHOWS TO ANYONE NOT WANTING TO WAIT FOR NETFLIX
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I love this story! What a fun read and it really did keep me anxious the whole time. I like the interaction with science the author brings to the standard thriller genre. It certainly makes the story more interesting.<br /><br />All of the characters are well thought out and described so that you find yourself believing in their motivations and desires, and empathizing with them on their weaknesses and shortcomings.<br /><br />Overall just a great read!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I spend my entire day using my iPad and Android virtually nonstop. I use the mobile devices because I need to stay mobile; I don't have time to stop, pull out a charger and wait for the battery to catch up. I bought this as a back-up after being more than satisfied by the 10000mAh version. The 8400mAh version stores enough energy to charge my phone twice, as well as one full iPad charge throughout the day (of course, iPads charge slower than phones). Anker makes products worth buying. This is my third Anker product and I have been pleased with each. I don't normally review products, but this power bank is a life-saver, so Anker deserves a little bit of my time.
B00899F0G8|3.0|I didn't jump on the PLL train until season 2. I'll admit, when it has its good moments, the show is intense and exciting and really gets you involved. However, sometimes it's boring and predictable. Watch it if you're bored.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is the funniest sit-com I have ever seen, British or American.  It's a shame only 12 episodes were made.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Best free Bible for Android I've found.<br /><br />Problem: New version asks for new permissions without explaining why (like this is the Apple AppStore). Please explain why you are requesting more access to my phone, so I can update to the new version! :-) Otherwise I'll just stay with the old version.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The graphics are great and the game is challenging,  creative, and fun.  However, the game definately Needs more rooms/levels.  Looking forward to updates.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|great movie- I loved Kevin Costner in it and this was the first movie I had seen him in - since I watched it, I have been watching a lot more of his movies. Of  course, Whitney Houston was terrific and her singing was beautiful
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Good game. Fun and very addicting. Highly recommend as I could not stop playing this game. Just good clean fun.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This is a great show and I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh! The humor is amazing and the characters were flawlessly cast. WATCH IT. You won't be sorry!
0811877485|1.0|Horrible product.  These did not stick well.  They are constantly falling off.  I tried to get the creases out of the butterfly and caterpillar but was unsuccessful.  I ended up using gorilla glue to get them to stay and now ruined the walls.  Do not buy these unless you enjoy being frustrated and disappointed.  I should have listened to the other reviews :(
B00C2IGQEW|5.0|Wooww...this is the best...one of the best movie by Martin Scorcesse again based by remake of Infernal Affairs Movies. You can't guess the ending til you finished the movie..brilliant cast by Leonardo DiCaprio,Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg and the others..
B00002N9ER|2.0|one of the prongs broke off pretty soon after i mounted it and used the light a few times.it still holds the light so i just left it on the wall.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was without doubt an amazing and interesting book that captures the attention of readers in its pages filled with thrill.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is an excellent calculator app and it is free what more can you ask for. it is affordable and excellently designed.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Excellent narrative! Couldn't put my Kindle down! I haven't read Gain an before, but now I'm a fan!! I will be buying more!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Best investment you can make for an iPhone. Also, should add that this case is also mouse-proof -- they tried to eat it at one point when I left it in my locker when going out for a horseback ride!
B00C2IGQBU|5.0|Still one of the best gangster movie based on biography..with good cast and brilliant acting by all casts. Shame butthis movie lost in Academy Awards to be a best picture, but Martin Scorcesse did a great job on this.
B005CWRB44|5.0|just a great edc light.only 1 small problem is the twist on/off bezel,if you dont twist it far enough off,it can turn on in your pocket from your pants tightening up pushing the bezel in.just have to push the bezel with your hand to make sure it is off after using it,putting it back in your pocket.minor inconvenience for such an amazing pocket torch.just as bright and throws a beam as far as the newest 2xD mag light.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love cant wait for the next one to come out. Best book every please keep reading the book and all of her other ones too
B00DU74U74|4.0|I love this book, and was really happy with how the movie turned out.  The actress to played Wanda/Melanie did a great job of showing the conflict inside.  Well done.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I tolerated this movie because of all the other Bourne movies. With that said, Die Hards should see it, the rest can save their money.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|Journeyman actors and a fairly predictable plot make this series so- so. The costumes, sets and scenery are fairly decent though. I guess if you like Vikings you are doomed to watch it........ seeing a dragon boat sail through a misty fjord is always fun, and the opening music is awesome.....
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest on my phone, what a temptation to browse all day!  I love having it available to me when I go in a store to make a recipe or craft.  No list making, just look it up!
B004XZR63M|3.0|This book has many good points, and starts out at a very good pace,but begging to drag at the end.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|ITS A FUN BOOK TO READ AND IT'll JUST MAKE YOU LAUGH!! FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HASN'T REA  THE BOOK , TAKE IT FROM ME! YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY READ THIS BOOK!!! :)!!!
0307271080|5.0|Excellent book. I love the way Chimamanda crafts her characters. I definitely identified with many of Ifemelu's emotions, as a \\"Non-American Black\\" and as a young woman discovering what truly makes her happy. I think it takes a unique skill to juxtapose all the little details of the main characters' lives with the macro-level analysis of the social issues surrounding race in America. I want more!!!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Not what I expected when compared to the other &#34;Die Hard&#34; movies. I should have had more action and believable stunts.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Thanks  to Dave Grohl for telling this  great story and also for saving the historic Neve console from the trash heap. Watching Sir Paul develop a song ( not to mention playing his cigar-box tenor resonator thingy) is icing on the cake. Very highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the variety of floors and hidden places, but as always, not enough floors to work to find my way out of!
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Great story as usual, well told,characters were great. But what is up with all the math? Jack Reacher is good with arithmetic, we get it!!! We don't need page after page of him figuring  how many handguns there are in town.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you need to get it it is a good game it is awesome get it for real it is cool.
B008BXKCBK|5.0|This album is gold. I bought the vinyl version after listening the band for a few time. I thought i was going to regret not meditating much my purchase, but I didn´t. The vinyl was very carefully packed and it included a code to download the album. It is awesome.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is a must see movie. It was realistic and the acting and action was always present. It even had a romance flavor to it.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|It takes good pics but you have to buy something to take a video what smart person thought you have to pay to take ONE video dont waste your kindle space dont get it thanks for reading that's why ill give it 2 stars
B005K17RU0|5.0|Both my husband and I use Accuweather.  We've tried other apps, but always come back to this one.  And we'll be keeping it.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|What a great story!!!!<br />This is really a great story with a plot that flows easily that make this one hard to put down.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Such an excellent film.  Other reviewers can doubtless do a better job describing the unique cinematography and fascinating development of the various characters crammed together in 'the boat.'  I want to point out that the the engineer (the chief) is a hero in this movie.  That is rare enough in films.  Beyond that, he is a real character with feelings, fears and hopes unique to himself, not just a technical master.  It's a small point, but it's one of that many reasons I like this movie so much.
B00CS74W0C|4.0|How can an author end a book right in the middle finger story without even a clue as to what the next book will be called...This is my first time reading Sylvia Day, I hope all her booms (theologies) aren't like this..UGH
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I was a little skeptical at first, but it turned out to be a good movie. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00008BXJG|5.0|I LOVE IT! Not like the crap that passes for music now'a days. AC/DC is good and hard. REAL rock.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I'm loving it!  Actually posted on Facebook to get feedback from friends who used it.  Love the notebook set up and that I can use photos.  I set up a notebook of business cards, took pictures, and cleaned up the kitchen bulletin board and purse!
B005C8ENI0|5.0|You get a gutt feeling as the case goes on the accused is not innocent.  Sure enough he is rotten to the core and Matthew has to decide if this case is worth doing the right thing. How do you stop someone you are supposed to defend.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|no fowl language, a little spicy but not obscene. great story line well written script, wonderful characters. just all around fun to watch.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|You got to stick with it and pay attention to details.....the ending will surprise you and it will all make sense
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was fabulous! The best book I have read since Harry potter. I never wanted to put it down. I could just read it for hours without end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought this app was really cool! You have to find items that you could use to escape these ten rooms! There are only ten levels though.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Simple to use, so many good templates and collages to choose.  Lots of fun, yet not so overwhelming with features it gets complicated.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|My father really wanted this for Father's Day, and it made his day to sit down and watch it. The sound quality is great on the concert, and the CD is nice. He seems really happy with it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it was a interesting game had to use your brain had a tough time on 6 but thanks to youtube it all worked out wish there were more levels
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a really realistic game that has all the physical stuff that  horse would do I love it!<br />It's amazing
B006M4F67A|4.0|I am really enjoying this game! Many different levels and difficulties and I don't always win (unlike some of the other free ones I've tried). If you like Mahjong, you'll like this one!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really enjoyed playing this game. It was a lot easier to beat the second time, but I'll probably play it again, enjoyed it that much. Can't wait for a new episode...
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Great game, but not enough floors!  I love this type game, but not enough to pay for a longer version.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|No instructions on how to use it and it would not display anything.  Useless application.  A waste of my time downloading it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|They really stepped up their game for season three! It's intense!!!  I really enjoyed the first two seasons but I'm completely sucked in on this third season.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Lacks focus, hard to keep my intersest.  Don't really like murder/love stories, although I give Sparks credit for expoloring other avenues.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This was a Fathers Day present for my husband. He loved it. It was packed a bit less packaging than I thought it would have, but the CD had no scratches.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A good brain challenge. Good fun game. Sometimes it's easier than you think and sometimes it's harder than you think but you figure it out in the end
1401201911|2.0|The concept was fascinating but the execution was very poor. I didn't see the purpose of all those tie-ins to other DC characters. Why was Batman/Bruce Wayne born in Russia all of a sudden? And that whole thing with Lex Luthor and the decimal point was confusing. Wonder Woman is so boring too.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Hitchcock is an entertaining film based upon his time around the making of Psycho.It stars Helen Mirren as AlmaReville(Hitchcock's wife) and Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock.Hitch has the desire to make a new more shocking movie as he feels the need to change his approach to win a larger audience.In Psycho the famous scene is the shower scene where Marion Crane(Scarlett Johansson/Janet Leigh) is killed off in the first half hour.We also see Vera Miles(Jessica Biel)playing Marion's sister.She remains in contract to Hitch although he feels she let him down by becoming pregnant 2 weeks before the making of Vertigo.Anthony Hopkins plays Hitch as a grumpy soul but not unlikeable,liking his chocolate cakes and shots of whiskey,to the annoyance of Alma.He also is shown to get `visits' from Ed Gein,the psychopath killer,upon whom Robert Bloch's Psycho is based.He seems to have imaginary conversations with him.<br /><br />Not an impersonation more an impression,Hopkins bulks large,stands imperious he seems like a cross between Churchill and Tommy Cooper(\\"Hitch to you.Hold onto the cock\\"to Janet Leigh).Alma played with intelligence and humour by Mirren is shown to be Hitch's main creative partner(lifelong) and support.She also has a writer friend, Whit(Danny Huston)she is doing a script with,which causes Hitch to have sleepless nights as he fears she'll leave him.To compound problems the film is 2 days behind schedule and is $60,000 over budget,and Hitch is having trouble with the MPAA censor about nudity and stabbing,who threatens to deny it a certificate.He also becomes ill with stress and collapses and Alma stands in for his director's role for a day or two.Only Hitchcock believed in this project,nobody else did.He can't get finance for the film and has to mortgage his house and swimming pool to pay for it.Alma asks him \\"why this film?\\".She also helps the stillborn film gain shape in the cutting room.<br /><br />We remember the version of The Girl on TV which showed Hitch making The Birds where he comes across as goulish and predatory.This is not like that.It's kinder without the rough edges.It plays upon some of the gossip where he gets too close to his leading ladies(spying on Vera Miles) and Alma allows these flirtations, which are a fantasy.I liked that pairing of two superb actors,Mirren and Hopkins,who have never worked together.Johansson is excellent as the malleable Leigh.I didn't think the Ed Gein `visits' worked.So,there's no character development,but Hitch is shown as a master shaman who depended a lot on his wife's input to each film.No images from the actual film Psycho are shown.James Darcy's Anthony Perkins is the best but most underused impersonation.Worth a look,with some good music.So no shocks,but good fun.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This movie is wonderful. I really love the message that it sends. I have a 5 and a 3 year old. My oldest is a little scared of the Boogie Man but I feel it's a great learning opportunity for him.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|The characters fluctuated in their assessment of the dire situation they found  themselves in. This kept the book alive and riveting from beginning to end as each character redefined him or her self . I found the language and dialogue harsh, but this did suit the text.
B00821OX98|4.0|I enjoyed the first season of Falling Skies.  I liked the Battlestar Gallactica feel of it - the last remnants of humanity being pursued by an overpowered alien force.  It even comes complete with a little of the alien spies among us conspiracy feel.  It has a very strong family theme running through it as half of the main characters are a man and his sons.<br /><br />The action scenes were fairly few and far between. I think that they just had all of the characters carry around assault rifles and smear their faces with dirt for every non-action scene to give you the battlefield impression.  When the aliens are present the puppeteering and CG are very good.  I would have appreciated more action, but the plot and story development was interesting enough to keep me wanting to watch the next episode.<br /><br />I would suggest it if you like Sci-Fi alien invasion stories, with a side of drama.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|At first this game was fun then their was nothing to do and all the good stuff you had to pay real money for!! People who think this looks fun , it dose look fun ( BUT ITS NOT!!!!!!!!)
B00DU74U74|5.0|My husband and I never heard of this till we rented it on Amazon. It was worth the chance. It is a movie that is safe for the whole family, yet, not too &#34;childish&#34; so my husband actually enjoyed it. It is a fresh story line in comparison to the repetitive, dull, and overly explicit movies out today.
B00C8RFRNI|5.0|This is not the typical CIA film. The cast was so amazing and so was the direction. The scenes all appear to be on location and it is a wonderful example of a pretty realistic look at how intense and difficult it is to be a part of this organization, Hand over your heart for the USA. Christine C
0756686970|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for my 5 year old. He is a little Star Wars fanatic. It is very detailed. I love how he can read about all of his favorite characters. I opted for this book over some of the others because of his age. I think it fits his age range perfectly. He spends hours looking through this book. I highly recommend this book.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app it is good to communicate with my friends that live in other countries.  Plus, it's fast.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|This was a fast pace movie and I loved it , Will have to watch it agin and agin and agin.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it was great. And it's great they made it off of the movie.That's why I give it a five star rating.
159463176X|5.0|Unbelieveable all 3of his books i enjoyed. great. i would read all of his book. just the way he intermengle the chareters
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I was amazed at how cheap they were selling the Star Trek video and then I understood. The DVD box was broken when I opened it and the DVD did not work. I was so disappointed!
0553573403|5.0|I may be late to the Game of Thrones party but I can't tell you how glad I am that I finally read this book.  I couldn't put down, and the 800 pages flew by faster than most novellas.  If you love fantasy and you haven't joined the legion of Game of Thrones enthusiasts, do yourself a favor and order this book.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I loved this game and played it all the time and then one day I opened the game it exited right out of the game and brought me back to the home screen on kindle fire fix it!!!!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Good acting by Karl Urban, he deserves this compliment only because it must have been awfully annoying to recite wearing a helmet at all time, and a weird looking helmet too: it had an 'X\\" in front which, in my opinion, must have reduced the visual a lot. But this is a minor, what I don't conceive is the society they're living in and all that power in the hand of a police officer is scary... in a movie it works fine, in real life it's a different story. Nevertheless, the story was kind of linear and easy to follow, with good special effects and lots of noise. Watch it, it's worth it if you have nothing else to.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It's a thriller, summer, easy reading, bad guys, heroes.  I like the forward by the author explaining his creative process too.
0345529057|5.0|I love the show and can't wait to read ALL the books!  The first book is so good from what I have read!
B001MSMULG|5.0|My first Daniel Silva book and I can't wait to read the next in the series.  I couldn't put it down and I'm attached to the characters now.  I'm having to wait a few days before I start the next book because I have been consumed with reading for the past 2 days!!
B005LAIIN0|2.0|Sorry guys, but I didn't care much for this film. I know it's PG-13, but it still could've had a little gore or suspense in it. Most of the zombies are cgi and falling and crawling over each other. Brad Pitt stars as a family man named Gerry Lane. When the outbreak starts, he's recruited by the military to find an antidote and stop the apocalypse. If you're a hardcore zombie fan, I would not recommend WORLD WAR Z!!!<br /><br />P.S. Warm Bodies is a better zombie movie than this.
B001Q4Z5Z4|3.0|I dedicate this three stars to all the actors in this movie; the story is not one of the best but it's different and worth watching. The genre is inevitably violent and bloody so keep the children away from it. If you like racing and driving dangerously then this is the movies to watch. Special effects were pretty good too. Yes I recommend it.
B009JBZH54|1.0|So I was excited to all 3 movies on bluray for $25.  Unfortunately the blurays films are burned funny.  They don't work on Sony PS3s.  The extra features etc for both films #2 and #3 work fine.  The actual films #1, #2, #3 do not work.  If you open the package and examine all 5 discs you will see that the films are burned differently or have some odd coating compared to the special feature discs.  This is the only explanation I have for the films not working.  I even had amazon send me another copy, and it was the same problem.  If you have a PS3 make sure you check each film disc to see if it works in your machine.  I'm returning my 2nd copy of the film too because again, it doesn't work.
0553801473|5.0|Loved the first one!  Can't wait to read more!  I still have the 3 in front of this to read!
B007SGM084|5.0|Good Grief!  While I was reading the first book on my kindle, my husband said I looked like I was about to have a coronary.  Now, I'm no prude, but.....................WOW, HOT!  The other 2 books were very well written, and much more involved in the characters lives.<br /><br />One can see Christian Grey changing right before your eyes.  As a whole, I loved the Trilogy!
B008JFUR10|2.0|I guess if you wanted to make a realistic Power Rangers movie, this is how it'd be done, but the story and characters were just weak to me. Whenever the robots fight the monsters, it's dark and rainy and you can hardly see what's going on half the time. The monsters are called Kaijus. They come from a portal underneath the ocean. Man begins to fight back using giant robots called Jaegers. If you want to see robots fighting monsters, you might enjoy PACIFIC RIM!!!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Die Hard has become a small movie series, this is the fifth and it shows no sign of slowing down in matter of interest, action, entertainment, and most importantly acting... however I noticed it has slowed down a bit in this episode, was it Russia or was it a bad timing who knows, I'll live this criticism to the professional commentators. What I saw was a very commercial, linear script, very predictable hence a bit less entertaining. Yes the traditional Die Hard plot where McLane goes alone against all odds, get stuck and just at the last moment, when all seems to go bad, he finds the solution, and with a big bang nails the bad guys etc etc. This plot is different, it is more family oriented, and I predict that the next episode will be even more into family matters. Nevertheless I still recommend to watch this movie for the theatricality Bruce delivers like a true professional. Can't wait for the next one :)
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great app game is fun and challenging and do no need to buy stuff in app to win like so many other apps !!!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|A compelling saga from early 20th century England. Absorbing character development. For those who enjoy complex story lines, a must-see.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|What can I say? I love Colleen Hoover's writing- she is the best right now. I love her character development, the angst, the wittiness- her books are smart with tough emotional undertones and true development of relationships. I cannot say a bad thing about this book. I heart Will. I laughed. I cried. I loved this book.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My daughter loves to play this game . She is excited every time I turn it on. When the new fish comes in she gets really excited
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Amazingly Cloud Atlas did not impress me too much. The story is kind of hard to follow and unless you really pay attention, you can understand that it's a continuous going back and front time travel depicting the life of two characters; the finale is a happy one. These four stars go to all the actors in the movie, that were so incredibly good at impersonating different roles to the point one would have hard time to recognize them. Don't miss it and don't miss the special effects, the action and ... yes I do recommend it.
B00425S1H8|5.0|The drivers work great for Windows 7 in 64-bit.  And since it has the threaded females, it matches up well with my serial cable (which has the male ends).  The one it replaced had female ends and would often come unplugged.
1781162646|5.0|This story is not a hard core thriller as is most ot King's books.  But I loved the different feel of the writing.  It is an introduction to another side of King...thoughtful, questioning and with a pleading ghost.  I reccomended it to my brother who is not a King reader.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an emotional, witty, smart read. I have recommended this to people of all ages. Having had a family member pass from cancer, this gave me a new perspective.<br />You will cry at the end...and maybe multiple times throughout. Very, very well written. I found myself wishing I knew Augustus! I am looking forward to the movie!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I loved the classic look and feel of the Weather Channel app, but the latest update took away the simple, clean, easy-to-read information and replaced it with pictures. The new picture-driven app offers a points driven reward system that is supposed to save the consumer money, but at what cost? Gone is a snapshot forecast that put high and low temps, likelihood if precipitation, and relative humidity for the next few days all on one screen. Gone is simple navigation based on the classic TV channel. Now, find in its place splashy ads, confusingly-labeled links, and forced social media interactions. On the plus side, it is pretty, and definitely touch-driven for today's devices. The severe weather reports can be set to alert you through your home page using a number of different chimes, which is nice. Unfortunately, even these useful alerts feel like ploys to make the consumer open the app on a daily basis.<br />If you want to feel like the Marketing Team has taken over your device, then this app will fulfill your desires. If you want the Weather, better look elsewhere.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|She, Kirsten Dunst, seems to be winning with the artsie type movie. I love this flick. The cgi helps to make the film beautiful, without cgi I dont think it would have been possible to create the full range of emotion. I bought it as soon as I knew Kirsten was in it, after having seen Meloncholia. Highly recommended!!!
B008ALAHA4|4.0|Works just fine.  I'm just a little annoyed that I needed to buy it.  Is Magsafe 2 significantly better than Magsafe 1?!
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|I ordered this for my 8yr old daughter when i purchased her kindle. Its made with good material and is very pretty. I can c it lasting a long time. Worth the buy
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you haven't read it, do it now. Best. Book. Of. The. Year. I was instantly drawn in, felt their connection and heat- felt their pain, their angst, their sorrow, their confusion....Colleen Hoover is hands down the best writer out there right now. I have recommended this book to many people and they all love it as well. The best of the best.

B005TZFZJC|5.0|I love this album, well I love everything about RiRi...this album went hard in the paint. Get it RiRi girl!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Really good take on Starship Troopers, aging, wars, humanity and what it means to be human... I really enjoyed this book, it's very well written and full of interesting ideas.
1451695195|1.0|Before I address the Biblical heaven part, I would like to point out that on page 23 the author was intubated (breathing tube), and on page 24 he shouted 3 words: \\"God help me.\\"  It would take a miracle to pronounce words with no air flowing thru his vocal cords.  But assuming that miracle took place, if you are a Christian, and want to know more about heaven, this book is not for you. What he describes as \\"heaven\\" is at best a description of what his mind experienced while he was in a coma; we can't refute what he experienced, but we can put his story next to the Bible, and know it was not the heaven and the God as described in the Bible. Why?  Jesus Christ is not mentioned.  There are several other views that contradict Scripture such as \\"nothing separates us from God,\\" and \\"you can do no wrong\\"; the Bible says all have sinned (Romans 3:23), and sin does separate us from God (Romans 6:23), but thank God He sent Christ to bridge the gap, and those who repent and confess their sin and believe that their sins were forgiven at the cross (John 1:12), those who are in Christ, yes, nothing will separate us from the love of Christ (Romans 8:35).
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great season, can't wait for the next one!  No shame in killing off the main characters...it definatley keeps you guessing.
B000YAA68W|4.0|My daughter had to read the book and watch the movie for summer reading.  She thought it was good for a book she had to read.
B009P5S11G|4.0|I really like this album, definitely a well-pleased purchase. I love Rihanna and she did her thing on this album.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|l saw this movie many years ago when movies where being shown in large, concert like halls in NYC. Don't remember where I was but I was young and mesmerized by it all. Move to the present and the movie did not disappoint me. It still conjures  up the excitement and thrills I experienced those many years ago.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The book has a great plot and story line. This book is good for all ages. The myth guidelines were decent.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Once my grandson showed me how to find the clues and in which order, I found this game quite fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to read this on a whim and I am so glad  that I did. The book was well written and held my interest completely. I can't wait to read the sequel!<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars.
B005NKGEP2|1.0|Of the four characters that occupy most of this novel, the three supporting characters were inadequately developed and implausible.  And the protagonist, Kate, was completely unrealistic.  I could not relate to her at all.  While it was good to see a woman in a lead/spy role, I don't know one woman who would act or think like Kate.  My sense is that author endeavored to position Kate the spy and mother as more human and fallible, but his efforts to do this made Kate seem naïve and stupid instead.  It was difficult for me to imagine that Kate was really a mother, and even harder to believe that she had been a successful career spy.<br /><br />As for the plot, the author's use of disjointed chronology as the book's architecture -- ostensibly employed to make the story more interesting -- had the effect of making the narrative largely incoherent.  Instead of holding my attention, this strategy obfuscated a plot which, although farfetched, might have improved the read somewhat if treated in a more honest, straightforward way.  I felt manipulated rather than engaged.  I endured the book all the way up until the last few pages, when the author finally started to bring things together.  And I still regretted the time I wasted on it.<br /><br />I wish I'd read more reviews before purchasing and reading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|One off the best free horse apps on Kindle! It does occasionally freeze on me  but it is a free app so this does not really bother me.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|I was hoping it was something like the Mahjong on my computer. I just find it a bore to play.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is a great way to stay in contact with family and friends without designating a mutual time for conversation.
B005H0CBZ0|4.0|I have read and enjoyed the first 2 novels in the &#34;Highlander&#34; series and wished to continue reading the adventures of Claire and Jamie and look foward to reading the 4th and 5th books which have already been published as this series was written some 10 years ago.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|Color is perfect, The tight fit is great protection. It's easy to carry and I can spot right away where I may have put it down!
B009VIZDLI|3.0|An ejoyable book and definitely a book for a bookclub as there are many interesting points in the book for discussion.  The bookclub I belong chose this as one of our books and made a great discussion afterwards with people's varying opinions.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was too good to be true and I couldn't put it down. I scored it 4 on the count I didn't care for the end of the book and I felt like... That was it???? I guess I expected a better ending.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|I have always had an interest in the night sky. Now I can actually identify what I am seeing without having to read through a book.
B005BOHYW2|4.0|Different but nonetheless, enjoyable.  Characters were likeable.  Explanation of flowers was useful.  Overall, happy with the ending. Would read this author again
034580404X|4.0|Its been boasted to have S&M and a lot of sex....but it was more a love story to me than a sex book.  Those into S&M will enjoy the tidbits in book one, and less tidbits in book 2.  Book three they could have tossed out!!  I LOVE the battle for dominance in the first book.  That was more a turn on than the actual sex scenes!  MOVIE SUCKS!!!!  if I was E. L. James, I'd be very upset.  They turned it into a Porno!!! BOOOOOOO  kill the movie, it makes the book look like it would be so distasteful!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Found this hard to get into but eventually got into and found it hard to put down.  Felt that the language in the book wasn't always necessary.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|A nifty little app for when you need something to do. Good graphics and tutorials make using the guns simple.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is a book that stays with you. It's not always the easiest read, but the hard issues are somewhat softened by the child's point of view. If you are a victim of abuse, this book might be triggery for you (I know it was for me), but it's still a damn good read, and will kick you hard in the feels.
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|The classic, overused nail gun nonsense. This is a great test of how dumb a movie is: if they fire a nail gun at a distance, which is not possible, since something has to press against the tip before it will fire, you know the writers/director make no effort to create believable or plausible situations. Yes, it's a horror movie and thus not possible by its very nature, but that does not mean there shouldn't be basic realism in the character's behavior and in the things they do within the fiction. There is no attention to detail here, and no effort is made to at least avoid some of the most overused and tired Hollywood formulas.
B002ZBN13A|5.0|I was just buying this in digital for because I have lost my original copy.  One of my all time fav albums
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Riordan pens a gem of a story with \\"The Lost Hero.\\" The novel opens with Jason, Piper, and Leo attacked by storm spirits on their way to Wilderness School. But Jason has a problem - he's lost his memories. Can he lead his friends on a quest to prevent Gaia from awakening?<br /><br />The story introduces three new heroes to Camp Half-Blood and a new problem - Gaia, mother Earth herself. Jason, a son of Jupiter, is heroic, fierce and brave, but a little unsure of his abilities. Piper is loyal and true, but can she rise above the challenges and prejudices a daughter of Aphrodite faces? Leo loves to fiddle with his hands, but are his inventions a help or a hindrance on their quest? These new heroes will be given plenty of tests to prove their worth, but can they overcome challenge after challenge?<br /><br />Riordan's writing style is sharp and witty, appealing to a young adult audience. The plot takes plenty of twists and turns. Jason embodies the classic Greek hero. Piper and Leo appeal to the modern audience as Riordan shows not only the character's vulnerabilities and insecurities, but also their strengths. Piper proves that true love is more than skin deep, and Leo shines as a hero from the school of hard knocks.<br /><br />What Riordan does best is give Greek mythology a modern twist, attracting modern young adults.<br /><br />\\"The Lost Hero's\\" story appeals to readers of all ages and genres. The novel's endearing characters and suspenseful plot will have readers on the edge of their seats. A definite page-turner! I highly recommend this book.
B001D0DQUC|4.0|It's a classic 80's flick-always entertaining and fun for a new gererartion to enjoy the antics of Ferris. the end
B005LAIGSC|2.0|What a boring movie.  Safe House (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet) just couldn't hold on to my attention.  I've tried several times to watch it.  Perhaps you will have better luck than i.
B000ICXQOM|4.0|Bruce Campbell stars in this pseudo low-budget cult classic. I absolutely love this picture, the scene in the graveyard is priceless. Watch this movie!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very fun until you run out of diamonds.  Was disappointed that this is one of those games that try to get u to constantly spend money
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Fantastic albeit one sided story of the great rise and fall of Jordon Belfort.  Great summer read.  Movie coming out in November.
B009HSVHV2|3.0|It is not Crazy Nights or Destroyer, but it is a Kiss album so you have to have it!! :)
B009L9IQA2|4.0|i have this in cd, just wanted to have vinyl version, and it does not dissapoint, if this double lps contains 40 or more hits, it will be more worth it
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The best book by Khaled Hosseini. A wonderful story rich in recurring themes. Unlike a thousand splendid suns and kite runner this is ultimately uplifting.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Well-written mixture of humor and action, with a dash of romance, as all good hero-movies should have.  I highly recommend this movie and can't wait for the sequel's release this weekend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|much better than I thought. its a good buy for its price, free. get it got it great enjoy this app
B0015HOFZI|4.0|This is exactly what I was looking for. It doesn't take much space and I use the speakers from the computer.<br />You have to know how to use the sound-forge application first; you record the song/LP and then you convert it to mp3. If you don't want to spend much time editing you can record the whole LP into a computer format and then copy and paste each song from the master you recorded to a new separated file. I haven't find a better way to do it yet.<br />I hope this helps.
B001GU04MW|4.0|it is overall quite satisfy with this lp, with two hits such as the black magic women and omye make the lp a good collect
B006KX3GXO|1.0|There are no legitimate reasons for an ad supported photo app to have the outrageous permissions this app does.  Whether or not you like the functionality of this app --- keep in mind it is spying on you! Tell the developer this is NOT ACCEPTABLE!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is just plain awesome. SO much better than Temple Run and Subway Surfer!<br />I would recommend this game for everyone
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Very cute and fun for my daughter. I would recommend it for children and mommy and me time would be a lot of fun with this too.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is a breath of fresh air compared to all the reality shows and police dramas out there. Don't get me wrong, I like police dramas sometimes, but it's nice to watch something different every now and then. The quality of the videos is great, although I had a few problems with Amazon during an episode. I thought at first it was my connection, but other sites were fine. Aside from that one glitch, it was perfect watching it stream onto my TV from Amazon. I highly recommend this show!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love it! My nine year old son played it for over an hour.He just said this is fun cause the time just flew by.
0062082353|5.0|IF you can get past the language this book tells is like it really is. It is a first hand look into WAR and a real war HERO. Thanks to Chis and his sweet wife for writing this. He is sorely missed.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|This is a nice game that is quite addictive and funny. Worth a look if you have some time to kill and love games that you can simply pick up and play.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|amazing sound quality due to exceptional recording efforts. Really interesting mix of songs and many retro elements from many decades past. Several slower songs which are quite beautiful, but if you are looking for pure part or dance music, you might select some of the singles instead.
B001L5YW9I|4.0|This was an engaging story line as well as a glimpse of what it was like during the war between the French and English as well as the Indians.  The scenery was beautiful.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Excellent game but Amazon Appstore is too slow updating it, its already 2 weeks and counting that version 0.7.2 is available at Google Play and iOS App store and here isn't available yet, five star game but one star service from Amazon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I lust uv this game! never had a problem with the game!  Very challenging and relaxing at the same time.

B000NVIXDW|5.0|Just what I wanted.  Included was a nice selection of old hits.  I almost felt like dancing while I listened to Buble signing.  loved it!

B005Q1W10A|5.0|We started watching and immediately got reeled in. We are looking forward to the next season. It was worth the money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was fun to while away away the time with, but like a lot of the free games it runs out of steam to quickly. But with more levels could be more interesting.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is the coolest app ever since. If you rate this app you update. BUY IT NOW!!!!!<br />THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|LIKE the title says, a good time killer. Fun and very addictive. I would play this until my Kindle Fire dies... Good game
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Grandkids have enjoyed trying to find the clues and determine what to do with the items after they are found
8590379825|5.0|This book does a great job of explaining Lua. It is good to know the information comes \\"straight from the horse's mouth.\\" I found it to be clear, concise, and accurate. Lua is simple enough to pick up without a text like this, but going through the explanations in the book really give a good insight into what is available and how things work.<br /><br />I have a fairly extensive scripting background, so I am not sure how the book would be for someone who is new to scripting. I still think it is a must-have in that situation, but it might be more difficult to get through some of it.<br /><br />My recommendation? Get this book if you are using Lua 5.1. Get the new edition if you are using Lua 5.2.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book had a lot of sex for no reason./ no plot that is grabbing<br />It was boring and repetitive
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Absolutely the most addictive and thrilling game I've ever played! My heart just keeps racing faster the faster the minion runs! Such great fun!
B005IQZB14|4.0|by a very strong woman unafraid of revealing her vulnerabilities. one feels they are  walking every painful step with her, viewing unseen forests. enduring the freezing cold and the burning heat.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love it, its easy to do and fun :) love the choices so I can mix it up and have a change... I got it for free I don't really see myself paying money for it but the free one hell yeah totally worth it
B00B3YLI8U|4.0|sometimes I would just skip a page because there was seemingly way more description, even repetitively, than we, as Americans, tend to have evolved into appreciating in modern times.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|I'm a Sabbath fan from the old days, but they were never my favorite and I never really listened to Ozzy's solo work. I listened to this album somewhat out of curiosity and I haven't stopped since!!! I think it's as good any anything from their past . . .
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was a great book and I enjoyed it. I wanted to read the book because I loved the movie. And I chose five stars because I loved the imagination that was put into the book. That is why I loved the book.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Does everything I need a calculator to do. Got my 99 cents worth, which you can't say about every app you pay for.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|First time I saw the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Rings, I thought I was going to pass out from boredom.  I did watch it a second time and I loved it.  I suspect I will have to watch this again to see if I will grow to love it.<br /><br />This installment is very slow moving, similiar to the first installment of the Lord of the Rings.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is amazing. It was also a great Addition to the series. I started this series in second or first grade so I say it is great for all ages
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|A fun game.  But not easy to navigate around and is not a lot of playing time before you run out of chips to get in a game. To play a game with a friend both have to be online at the same time.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game can be on Xbox or PlayStation becuz this game is so cool and it's actually worth $5.00 I love it
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't wait to read more of their story, it was one of those stories I was able to fully immerse myself into. The Characters are so like-able you fall right in love with Layken and Will. You will cry with them, laugh with them, get mad at both of them. It was one of those books you talk to, I fussed at Lake and Will, and my family thought I went crazy, talking to a book and all, lol. Defiantly a book I would recommend to my friends and family and strangers!!!! I will read every book Colleen Hoover ever publishes, so far she hasn't let me down<br />I am in the middle of Point of Retreat(Slammed#2) and so far so so good, lol then I am onto This Girl(Slammed#3). I love how in her book you get to see the story from Layken & Will POV, and am really looking forward to Book 3 That starts at the begining from Wills POV.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Challenging and makes you think a lot. When you need to take your mind off of other things. I highly recommend this!
B000YDG5X4|5.0|This is the sixth pair we have bought.  Durable enough for the jobsite, but don't look like work boots when you need to go to a meeting.  Size is a touch big even with the wooliest of socks.  10 is the smallest size we've ever bought. Usually a 10.5/11 in athletic shoes and an 11 in designer dress shoes.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Great show based in a time of great turmoil. Love the story line and all the history behind it. Can't wait for the next season.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like the game, I think it's so awesome. I prefer everybody play this one and rate it because if u don't your a loser.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I now have an up close and personal picture of the war in the Pacific from an enlisted infantryman . The war in the Pacific story never received the same attention as the European one. Yet it seemed more brutal if that's possible .<br />Anyone interested in WW 2 must read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game to pass the time with.  The physics engine is great, allowing for an element of skill.  There's something so satisfying about seeing the coins drop.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Fantastic product! It's my 2nd, for downstairs. Get additional batteries, they are nice to have on hand! So I had to have 2!!
6305784116|5.0|I bought this DVD used but when I opened the package and inspected the DVD, it appeared brand new. Well worth the price, which was actually less than I paid for shipping.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's awesome I like playing the game I really have fun playing with other people. I like when they got a lot of cards and the come back. Then when you got one card expecting you going to win and then you don't.
B002SZAU1Y|5.0|I cried myself through this book. It is so sentimental, but not in a bad way. Ahern writes so beautifully, the reader can instantly connect to the characters. I appreciated the non-Hollywood ending.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Puts life into perspective for those that don't have enough fun with their families and friends.  Robin Williams was excellent - as always.  Fun and lighthearted.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The interview format lends a unique series of viewpoints. You see the effects of the war on vastly different people the world over. Mr Brooks has a vivid imagination! Or is it only imagination?????
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read several books by Ken Follett.  I love his writing.  His characters are always interesting.<br /><br />He seems to be indirectly pointing out parallels between the rise of fascist Germany and current conditions in the U.S.  (at least that was my impression).  I had been observing blind nationalism, widespread economic depression and wealth disparity, and the growing power of conservative Governors in the U.S. this book heightened my concerns.  It should serve as a warning to Americans, and the heroic characters in the book serve as models for resistance.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The headline pretty much sums it up. Being a Russian I can't help but notice all these &#34;subtle&#34; passages on Rissian, Chinese and Japanese politics, authorities and tactics.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Considered slow and somewhat confusing to begin became  suddenly unable to put down an excellent read with an unexpected.outcome  an example.is.Soviet life at its worst.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is so much fun! Normally I can't play solitaire for that long without getting bored, but I could play this game all day!!
B00BV1OT0O|4.0|If you love the minions and the movie, this is a good product to get. Great to collect! Looks good on my desk
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|and fun!! Just wish the upgrades weren't so expensive. And of course you gotta buy the coins, but it's still an enjoyable game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you love horses get this game it is the best I already have a real horse and its wild he protects me so bad he stepped on a guy that was about to steal my horse but get my horse everybody my name on my horse idababy so add me and I will send you 40  gems
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this was an awesome game if start to play you forget about time and get sucked in the ironman world
B000NTHT6G|5.0|A little strange, but A Lot GOOD. My favorite Will Ferrell movie!  But be warned it is not his typical role.  Still funny, but not as extreme and who doesn't have a huge crush on Maggie Gyllenhaal, plus you can't go wrong with Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Emma Thompson backing them up.
B005UG542S|5.0|Very suspenseful.  If I hadn't of read the book first I would have not been prepared for this one.  Very suspenseful right to the very end.
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|A delightful movie with such talented actors and actresses. Brings to light how people are always focused on the outer appearance of people instead of the person and that we are all beautiful in our own way.
B0062162N0|5.0|This season is so full of surprises, I missed one half of one episode and was lost.....hee hee get it &#34;lost&#34; until I went back<br />and rewatched the episode I fell asleep during.<br />This and Hero's (amazon prime) are my two favorite shows ever, with falling skies quickly catching up.<br />as far as impacting me....well no, I don't think tv shows that are meant for pleasure should impact your life.<br />It has helped me kill some idle time, and some time that I shouldn't have been idle...lol<br />anyway, I think everyone I know has watched this at least once. if you haven't yet seen it. start with season one.<br />and Watch every show in succession to get the most out of it. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|After watching Food Inc I will definitely pay more attention to what type of food I purchase and from where. It really wakes one up to how we as people are also being herded as cattle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book was really good. I would definitely recommend this book to many other people. Great book. I loved it!
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|Tried it, it's fun but useless. Installed it for a short bit to have some fun with the kids but then uninstalled it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is so addicting that I couldn't walk away from it!  I watched all 3 seasons in a week!  Don't delay, get yourself some Downton Abbey today!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. It's basically like Temple Run, but with Minions which make everything more fun! I think everyone should try it. :)
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I thought it was a very cute, entertaining film. It made me laugh, and it contained a very good message about love and family.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Love this game.  It is thoroughly addicting and you can't stop playing once you get started and start figuring out how it works.  Lots of little surprises and lots of different levels of play.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Why end it there?! That's all that I can say. The end posted me off a little bit, where the silver lining in that Matthew Quick! Aww well otherwise engaging and well written. Maybe he will write a sequel.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect since I did not read a lot of reviews nor have I read the book.<br /><br />It's a different type of alien movie. No ray-guns, no big space ships, no big time special effects. There are some special effects, but this movie relies mostly on storytelling and acting. When they describe it as a \\"Romantic Thriller,\\" it's more romance than thriller. For the most part, the movie kept my attention, I liked the characters and felt everything was well done. I felt the movie did fizzle out in a few areas but nothing major. The ending, the very last part, did not seem to fit. An add-on that was a bit too much. Basically, a teenage girl SciFi story.<br /><br />The lead actress does a pretty decent job. William Hurt is great and if not for his performance, I seriously doubt I would have liked the movie half as much. Mr. Hurt grounded the story and made it much more believable.<br /><br />This movie is mostly family friendly. No bad words nor nekkied people. A couple of people get shot.<br /><br />Having seen it, this is a movie I would stick on my \\"to watch when I have watched all the good stuff\\" list.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This is one of the few games for the Nintendo DS that is rated Mature...and for good reason this story is a dark as it is gripping. Following the lines of games before it such as Hotel Dusk and Trace Memory, this game is perfect for any DS owner over the age of 17; the story is intricate and fascinating and the game play is simple and well designed. The game gives you plenty of clues to be able to solve all the puzzles so if you're not a big puzzle gamer then you'll be able to manage your way through, but it's also complicated enough the puzzle fans will enjoy the gameplay.<br /><br />There's a lot of replay value in the game. With six different endings that require a bit of trial and error to get, there is plenty of fun to be had. In fact you need to complete the game at least twice to get the &#34;true ending&#34; Each storyline also gives you a little more insight into the overall story making each replay all the more interesting (don't worry you can fast forward through all the dialogue you've all ready read).<br /><br />Admittedly the game is a lot more text than gameplay, while it's marketed as an puzzle game, it is definitely more visual novel than puzzle, which might make the game less fun for those that don't like to read a lot. But the story was so intense and gripping that I could hardly put the game down.<br /><br />The downside is that you do have to suspend your belief a lot in the story (Apparently the Titanic was cursed by a mummy that was on board frozen by something called Ice-9...which is ice that only melts at 96 degrees) and that you can only have one save file.<br /><br />All in all, this is a game completely worth every penny.
B00BSBUZT6|1.0|For two times now the 3 DVD History of the Eagles ordered from Amazon.com are not able to be recognized and are unplayable.  Tried on 2 different DVD players and 2 PC's.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|Possibly, one of the highest rated shows, EVER!<br />1 session...really?! LOL!<br />What, was it TOO political? ...inquiring minds want to know.<br />Loved the series, and loved the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is really well written. There is a lot of excitement and great character development. I really had a hard time putting it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game. Has a couple glitches like when you are using a powerup you can not see what is coming up ahead of you.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This is the coolest app I have on my Xoom.  Envy of my family as I logged into SWTOR and played that from my xoom.  Additionally, I have a mouse and keyboard addeed to my Xoom, so from my bed I have the power of my computer, I dubbed UltraBeast because of it's 7.9 across the board ratings in Win7, on my Xoom.  The only draw back is that the computer doesn't instantly update to the screen, but really, if I was trying to game anyway, I'd want to actually be on my computer.  The graphics and all of that are run through the computer, and it's just a remote display and controls on the Xoom.  Another thing I have done with this app was to set up a dual boot on my computer.  Because dual booting can take a long time to get set up, well, installing windows and then adding all the updates and programs I want, I did it all in my recliner while watching TV with my girls.  Anything you can do on your computer you can do here.  The computer runs smooth as ever with it running in the background.  Loads of options to customize your view.  I actually have two monitors and the app allows you to switch from screen to screen pretty easy as well.  It's the score of the year for me because I got it free, but I am cheap and I would actually pay for this one if I knew how awesome it was.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Kaleb Krycheck, scariest villain and most mysterious character in the Psy-Changeling series, is vivisected--heart and soul exposed--in book 12. If you've been waiting for his story as long as I have, it will exceed all of your expectations.<br /><br />Not for a day, not for a second, had he forgotten his search, forgotten what they'd taken from him. The preceding books elude to his hidden agenda, his preoccupation with...something. His search is over on the very first page and, holy Silence, the intrigue never lets up.<br /><br />This installment is a revelation of telekinetic wonder. It embodies the idea that a kicka55 outcome vindicates the overlong narrative it takes to get there. The characters and their motives are mind-muddling complex, but your sympathy for them will run as absolute and deep as the PsyNet.<br /><br />Book 12 accentuates this unique series as a visionary fusion of futuristic technology, philosophy, romance and tantalizing action. The sex is scorching, the tone dark and somber. The ending clots the air with the tension of looming revolution, raising the hairs on your spine and knotting your muscles in anticipation for the next book. Change has arrived and it's thrilling to know this series is far from over.<br /><br />All I can say is Hell Yeah, Ms. Singh! Bring it on!

B0074MZSWW|5.0|I really dig this Alabama Shakes album...reminds me of a visit to Cracker Barrel. From the very first song it's like I'm sitting on the front porch, leisurely rocking in a rocking chair, waiting for a table. In the next couple of songs it's like I'm sipping on some sweet tea while perusing the menu, deciding on which meat-laden entree I will choose. At some points they really start to wail, like I ordered the cornbread and they brought me regular biscuits and I'm all like, \\"WHAT? NOW, I'M GONNA RAGE!\\"

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We have really enjoyed this series. We ran out of things on regular tv so we checked this out and it is a lot of fun.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|I enjoyed this film a lot.  I am currently a 3rd year law student, and I can say first-hand that the parts of the movie that relate to the daily life of average lawyers is pretty accurate.  It's a good film with great casting.  Danny Devito is great, as always.<br /><br />This movie is part comedy, but more drama.  The law varies from state to state, so I can't comment very much on the accuracy of the legal aspects of the film.  However, I didn't see anything that made me want jump up and down screaming &#34;that would NEVER happen!&#34;, which, unfortunately, is how I react to most lawyer movies.<br /><br />I didn't give it five stars because I reserve those for truly excellent films, and this was not quite up to that level.  Still, it is well-worth watching.
B00AEBBA1I|5.0|I already had a copy of SWEENEY TODD on DVD but I bought a copy on Blue-Ray because it was on sale and it was inexpensive. It had been a while since I had viewed either the DVD of the Lansbury/Hearn stage production or the Burton/Depp film.<br />I remember panning the Sound track of the film (It was issued shortly before the film hit the theaters). Apparently, I never reviewed the film and that's a good thing.<br /><br />I put this in the DVD player the other day and for the first time I viewed the film without comparing it to the DVD of the stage play or my memories of Sweeney Todd on stage.<br /><br />This is a great Film! Yes, there are missing songs and music and the singers here are more like the film actors that they really are but this gives the movie a spontaneous quality making it seem as though the music and lyrics are thoughts in the heads of the actors that are sometimes spoken and sometimes unspoken.<br /><br />I underated Johnny Depp. His performance including his singing is perfect for this project and so are those of the entire cast.<br /><br />Tim Burton has given this film an atmosphere of darkness punctuated by flashes of brightness in scenes of Todd's past or Lovett's imagination of the future.<br /><br />I Loved it. You should still see the DVD of the stage play for the performances of Lansbury and Hearn & Company singing the full score, but see this as well. Time Burton and Johnny Depp have earned their places in the Sondheim section of my video library.

B00CW665VI|3.0|I agree that 5 stars for this book is way over rated- it's the typical story of yet another girl falling in love with an arrogant jerk. I kept reading it to see if they actually ended up together and of course they did, so it's a safe expected read. Time filler.

B007UPNA6Y|3.0|After reading some rather negative review of this book, I almost did not buy it. But then, if you are addicted to Jack Reacher, like I am, you cannot let go of it just because one reviewer was disappointed. So, I bought it and am happy to say I do not regret it. The book lives up to your expectation of Jack Reacher - a fighter for what is right, undeterred by challenges and opposition. True, the car ride gets a bit monotonous, but you are never bored.<br />Of course, if you compare the book with \\"Single Shot\\", then it is much milder in its thrills, suspense, and romantic appeal. But it is still worth a read. If you are a Jack Reacher fan, you will enjoy it. _ C H Mehta
B0035LJY6C|5.0|The characters, the setting, the tone are all wonderfully faithful to Charles Adams' original drawings and to the TV series. The plot is well written and moves along at a good pace. The casting choices are brilliant. I couldn't think of anyone who could do a better job of portraying these characters. Nice elaborations on the Addams family details that are in complete congruence with the original but make the movie feel big and full the way only a feature film budget can.

B00DHHWXYY|3.0|\\"When I came back from New York I was disgusted. Disgusted with everyone and everything. Only one man was exempt from my disgust.\\" Nick Carraway (Maguire) is a war veteran and aspiring writer who is working as a bond salesman on Wall Street. When he stops to visit his cousin Daisy and her husband he begins to see lies in the marriage. One day he receives an invitation to a party thrown by his millionaire neighbor Gatsby (DiCaprio) and his world becomes changed. This is a movie that I was really not excited about seeing at all. In spite of myself I am a DiCaprio fan and I have liked the movies that Luhrmann has made but to me the movie looked boring. I have never read the book so I wasn't really familiar with the story at all. I had an expectation of the style the film was going to be but that was about it. I thought the beginning was very slow moving and I was worried that the movie would not hold my attention. While it never really picked up too much I did find myself sucked in and am really glad that I stuck it out and finished it. To me this is not one of Luhrmann's best movies and it felt like a non-musical Moulin Rouge but it was much better then I was expecting. Overall, better then I expected. Starts off slow but does get better and better and makes you glad you finished it. I give it a B.

B006QQ77F8|3.0|Stanley Kubrick is an amazing director but this was not one of his better movies. After reading Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov,which was AMAZING,  I was quite excited to find that there was an actual movie based on the book. Uh, no. This movie was based very, very loosely on the titled book. If one hasn't read the story by Nabokov then one is not going to understand this movie the way it was meant to be interpreted. The movie version almost makes Humbert Humbert seem like a normal man with a crush on his step daughter that eventually develops into more. Not the case at all. In fact, the movie was way off. Almost to the point where Humbert Humbert was likeable and Lolita as the aggressor. Not true. I understand that this movie was made in the early 60's and was very hard to interpret this movie into something that American audiences would have found acceptable viewing for that day and time. As the movie began, I sat back and said to myself, &#34;This ought to be interesting. However are they gonna pull this off?&#34; Well, they didn't. Just read the book. Do not watch this WITHOUT reading the book. It does not do Nabokov's literary talent any justice. If you must watch this, read the book first. You will get a better perspective of what this is really about.

And I'm sure it does... just not for me.<br /><br />I honestly fell asleep multiple times while reading it, and when I wasn't sleeping, I was overcome with an overwhelming feeling of dread... \\"More to add to my to-do list.\\" It just all sounded like WORK rather than inspiration. Rather dry and academic in its approach, it felt like many a text book I read in my sociology classes at Stanford.<br /><br />This book may be perfect for some, but it didn't speak to me where I am.

B001N3GUIE|5.0|Forbidden Planet has always been my favorite science fiction movie sicne I first saw it as a child at the theaters and on television. I was captivated by the story, which is what was meant to happen by filmmakers who took some liberties with the original book by Irving Block and Allen Adler, a fact I didn't know until I found the book earlier this week.<br /><br />I am no stranger to the way Hollywood changes books to fit the Hollywood version of happily ever after when there is no happy and sometimes no ever after. Very seldom does Hollywood stick to the script, except in the case of Cecil B. DeMille, and that is mostly because he remade his blockbusters at least three times and used the same script each time. The problem is that even DeMille changed the script to fit his vision of what the book should look like; I know that because I actually read Ben Hur:A Tale of the Christ, for instance, by Lew Wallace, who also wrote several other historical novels. That is a story for another time.<br /><br />Although director, Fred M. Wilcox, stuck pretty closely to the book's dialogue and story, he softened Edward Morbius and left out the dialogue that covers the real reason why Morbius was such a danger to mankind and the universe and chose to die with the planet. Morbius committed the ultimate sin; he wanted to create life.<br /><br />Do you remember the scene at the Gateway -- it was called the Teacher in the movie? Morbius at down at the machine with the probes touching his head and he \\"sculpted\\" a figure of Altaira, his daughter. Morbius said the figure was alive because Altaira was alive in his memory from moment to moment. Big lie! And what about Alta's friends? How did they get to Altair IV and remain exactly the same for 2000 centuries (that is 200,000 years in Earth time when math is applied)? Would not animals brought from Earth to Altair IV have adapted to their new world with protective coloring and attributes? Wouldn't they also have been destroyed in the night and day that destroyed the Krell? And yet there are monkeys (one of five different species, all males), two female deer obviously in their first year of life, and a Bengal tiger roaming the planet far from any other herds or visible life, and they just happened into Morbius's compound. Funny how the men from Earth spaceship C-57-D never glimpse any movement or signs of herds or life of any kind on Altaira IV when they arrived.<br /><br />Also missing from the movie is Major Ostrow, the doctor, dissecting a titi monkey Captain J. J. Adams just happened to back over when they were trying to uncover Morbius's secret meetings with the Krell still alive and kicking on the planet. The rest of the monkeys were also absent, but that may be due to having to deal with five monkeys on the set. They weren't really needed since the point of the monkeys in the first place was deleted from the script.<br /><br />Are you beginning to get what is missing? What Hollywood thought too shocking for the American family in 1956 to grasp and see splashed across the scene in Disney's best special effects?<br /><br />The real reason for the Krell's demise in the book is hinted at in several ways on the screen, and the annhilation of an entire species becomes more of a punchisment for usurping the Universe's -- or God's -- power. It is the same power that Dr. Morbius usurps and why he wants to hold onto the planet without Earth involvement. He has gone beyond Earth's power and he wants to keep it that way.<br /><br />Major Ostrow dies in the movie after using the Krell Gateway to expand his mind, but in the book he does not do so rashly. He is detailed, at his own request, to watch over Morbius and Alta, while the captain makes the ship ready to rocket back to Earth with Morbius and Alta in tow -- even if they have to be tied and gagged. Doc takes the opportunity to expand his own mind slowly and safely over the course of the night while Morbius is in the hands of psychotropic medication that keeps him awake -- mostly because Morbius is afraid to sleep -- and blissfully drugged. Short bursts from the Gateway give Doc what Morbius missed when he was first exposed and lay in a coma for a night and a day -- knowledge. What Morbius has spent 20 years trying to achieve Doc gets in his safe short bursts of Gateway use. Doc understands what really destroyed the Krell and what is at the heart of the Force that has torn apart some of the ship's men. At least Hollywood left that part alone and got most of it right.<br /><br />It was Morbius's souped up Id that was sneaking out when he was asleep to tear the ship's men limb from limb and sabotaging their ability to contact Earth. That monster of the unconscious mind no longer ruled by social convention or reason and fueled by the unlimited power of the Krell furnaces is determined to keep Earth from knowing what Morbius has done and wishes to continue doing -- create life.<br /><br />There it is, the reason behind Morbius's furtive actions and his warning to stay away from the planet or be destroyed by the Force. (This is a different Force from the Force that a Jedi uses, although it could be a taste of what perverted Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader, but that's another story altogether and happened much, much later.)<br /><br />Alta's friends are Morbius's attempt to create life, life that when dissected could not live. The vital organs are missing and what is left between what organs are part of the animal's makeup is a kind of stringy gelatinous mass like bloody stuffing. Remember, Morbius is not a biologist for a philologist, a scientist of words and languages. He has probably the most basic knowledge about how life is put together and thus he fills in the blanks in his knowledge with the bloody stuffing. It is unlikely that the animals even eat and certainly couldn't procreate since that would take a more profound understanding of biology than Morbius possesses.<br /><br />In the book, Alta tells Captain Adams that her friends just appeared one day when she was a child and had been there ever since. Animals that do not age or proecreate or kill for food or grow old and die, but what a life is the absence of true life. Life means growth and change and inevitably death. Morbius hasn't gotten that right yet.<br /><br />The book is a good one and I recommend it for fans of the movie and for fans of science fiction.<br /><br />While I enjoy the movie still, I find myself looking for clues in what Hollywood decided should be on the screen for what was central to the book.

B0084HJE0S|3.0|as preamble and want to know that it is, I think it's good just to leaf through the book and have no idea of what these languages ​​is OK, nothing ambitious
B005544TRQ|5.0|Witty & entertaining, not just a lawyer show. Finally a smart & different program, not just a same old usual boring one. Much better than most of them!
1781162646|3.0|I'd pretty much given up on King with \\"Under the Dome,\\" a book so full of King tropes that the book is truly derivative of his much better novels.<br /><br />I was given \\"Joyland\\" as a present, and decided it would be a quick read while on vacation. Although King's writing style is entertaining, this novella lacks any cohesive punch. The Scooby Doo mystery with the supernatural element (barely explored)seemed cliché. My first indication that this book was going to be rather trite came to me when King references the use of a household microwave oven, an appliance that didn't exist in 1973.<br /><br />As I said, it was an easy read and did have a certain charm, making me think of the book as a PG-13 \\"Hardy Boys\\" adventure, but not up to the high standard set by the blurbs on the back of the book, with comparisons to \\"The Green Mile,\\" and \\"Shawshank Redemption.\\"
B0013V8OFI|5.0|Picture and video quality is amazing.My daughter loved this movie. Watch it!!!! I promise you will really love it. She looks s&uacute;per cute and there's humor. So get your pop corn and relax and enjoy.

B001XUH69Y|4.0|nice to see drama w/o special effects just fine acting.  Our kids actually paid attention to the plot line and liked it
B005544TRQ|5.0|In a world full of junk reality tv, crime drama, and comedy sitcoms, Suits is surprisingly fresh and original. Great acting. Great characters. I'm not sure how long they will keep up with some of the plot lines but it is definitely one of the best new shows.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I have used this now on 2 phones and it has been great. It almost seems to read my mind as to what I want to type next.
0812993845|4.0|Some of the reviews I read, as I embarked on the journey of this book were setting me up for disappointment.  However, I can confess that while reading this book, I did burst out laughing out loud on a number of occasions.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella does an excellent job of \\"building\\".  She builds suspense, she builds tension, she builds frustration and the reader can sense it, feel it, understand it.  And, she does it all with a sense of humor.  When there is a disappointment, it is strongly felt.  Maybe, this is the gift of her humorous writing.<br /><br />Lottie wants to be married.  She yearns for marriage.  When Richard drops the ball and Ben walks in, Lottie and Ben try to recapture their gap year from 15 years prior.  Both of their memories may be a bit faulty, but one thing is definitely clear, they both loved the series Dirks and Sally.  The question is are they the soul mates they were 15 years ago and is this the love, for which both have been pining all this time?<br /><br />Fliss is sorting through her divorce from Daniel.  Things just aren't going well and their seven year old son Noah, is often the victim of miscommunication.  Fliss does not want to see Lottie make the mistake she made in marrying Daniel.  She wants to protect her little sister from the disappointment and heartache of a potential divorce, especially one with child.<br /><br />Lorcan is Ben's alleged best friend and right hand man at work.  Following his divorce four years prior, he has thrown himself into his work.  Then, along comes Fliss.  But, are they working to obtain the same objective or at odds with each other?<br /><br />Richard wakes from his commitment fear and tries to fly back into the picture on his \\"white horse\\".  The question here, is will he be successful and is he too late.<br /><br />As Arthur says, a few times, throughout the book, don't come back.  You grew up.  Is that what happens, or can one go back and find the true love of their lives?<br /><br />Wedding Night, was a very enjoyable book.  It is fun, light hearted and good for some laugh out loud moments.
B005LJETYI|5.0|If you love Starship Trooper and Star Trek's space time paradox, this is a must read.  Don't worry to much about the logic of quantum mechanics. Just tag alone and enjoy the ride. This is a story worth reading with a rich background universe.  Too bad there aren't any sequels, yet.<br /><br />Translation is also top notch.  The translator skillfully translates this book into English, which is not an easy task. Any Google translator can translate a book into another language.  But skill is required to translate the source material into English with appropriate cultural reference.  When you read this book, you will not noticed it is a translation from another language.  It is that smooth.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|This is my all-time favorite vampire movie! As much a story of budding young love as it is the \\"need to feed\\", we observe 12-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) meeting a mysterious new girl who walks around barefoot in the snow. Begrudgingly at first, the girl, Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), succumbs to Owens wide-eyed, innocent charm, and they soon become fast friends.  Unfortunately, four bullies also find Owen an interesting target for their first mayhem/murder. Abby's growing love for Owen provides positive protection when needed, and we observe a life-long devotion develop between the two teens.<br /><br />If you like vampire movies, you'll love this one. If you like love stories, you'll love this one! Kodi Smit-McPhee adds credibility and Chloe Grace Moretz (Hit Girl of \\"Kick Ass 1&2\\" fame) weaves her magic yet again in another dazzling performance!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game but won't let me connect to Face Book, have no idea why?  But still a fun game, my kids love it too
B001B2CPH2|5.0|Glad to see the possibilities after life. It deserves a sequel movie, where the undying spirit returns. Who knows what he can teach others who need help!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie exactly for what it was, a fun retelling of the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale.

1475143389|5.0|Eye Opening!! Great Book! I would definitely recommend it! I picked up this book because, I am always looking for good ideas on how to become more fit and it did just that! The author covered the basics and then went into other areas that I wasn't aware of and went into detail. There was information that I already knew, but a lot that I didn't know. I got my money's worth! Go get yours!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig is superb in the Bond role. It's a well made movie, fast paced, gritty, enjoyed every minute of it. Will miss J Dench after this.
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|story line was good but there were a couple spots that added nothing to the story ie: foul language which was disappointing
0061120073|5.0|An old fashioned very well written it keep me enthralled just so good good book. I really loved it. Fantastic
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Cant go wrong with pink floyd. Awesome band! Anything by pink floyd is a must have for the 70's rock collector.
1400069289|5.0|Duhigg did his research. The stories and methods in this book explain the why and how of how habits are made and how they can be changed. Excellent read from start to finish. I skipped over the corporate habits section during my first read. I read it the second time through and was pleasantly surprised to learn that a lot of corporate behaviors apply to individuals as well.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I admire the doctor for writing his book.<br />I learned a lot about the medical aspects of the brain even though at times I found it a bit confusing..<br />It seems that our vocabulary and ability to really explain the next dimension leaves us at a lose for words!

B008X9Z3UC|3.0|Ordered because of experience with Belkin products and I had a discount voucher from Amazon. I use the Amazon cover for my kindle fire hd 7 and wanted extra protection for an upcoming trip. This case fits exactly without the Amazon cover. Not what I wanted. Cover is very soft and will provide some protection for a kindle packed with other items. There is no space for anything else in the case (stylus,cable,charger,etc.). I do not like to use my kindle without a cover but maybe I can learn to do it.<br /><br />Wish someone would make a ballistic zipped case that would hold the kindle fire hd 7 & a stylus,cable and charger. Maybe a handle or carry strap.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|Without giving away plot lines, just be prepared for some twists and turns along the way. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, it definitely has his signature all over the movie, which I liked because I am a fan of his movies (Oceans 11, 12, 13, Contagion, Syriana, The Big Empty - to name a few.) Not for kids, so pay attention to those little ears and eyes around you.
1594745692|5.0|This deck is really cool, and I am so pleased with the art and quality of the cards!  The box that it comes in  is really really nice too!  I am going to purchase another for my sister for her birthday!  thank you for a fantastic tarot deck

B008QMMEOE|5.0|My three year old son LOVES this app. It amazes me to watch him figure out the puzzles. it took him a little while to learn to &#34; drag &#34; , but this app made him want to learn, and want to do puzzles. I went ahead and bought the full version to unlock all the puzzles. This is hands down the best puzzle app I have come across.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Hands-down, the best movie we've seen in quite awhile. Ben Affleck really redeemed himself in this movie; in which he also directed. I was amazed that this was a true story. I was a teen when this crisis happened and followed it closely and I never heard this story. So, I found it even more fascinating due to that fact. Top notch cast and acting, coupled with fantastic direction makes this movie unforgettable.
B000I3W1XS|4.0|Not quite as good as Star Trek 2 and 4, but a nice connector between the them.  If only the new Trek movies were as good as this.
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|Yes, Ozzy can't take the notes up there anymore but so what? He smartly uses his aged voice to produce low, depressed tones, taking us back to &#34;what is this that stands before me&#34; days. The dark age of metal is served with hints of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, a touch of Sabotage infused with Paranoid, finishing up with with The Wizard. I loved it as much as I hated Never Say Die.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|im no hip hop expert,and im new to the game (ive been a major fan of Genesis, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith..) so it should be a surprise that im even into this genre. That said,i think JayZ is the king of hip hop,while Kanye West can be the bad boy.<br /><br />Wests first two albums were strong and fresh,then he seemed to get a little too commercial around Graduation (which was commercial but still very good). But with things like 'Heartless'..i enjoyed it,but thought he lost his bite. Watch The Throne gave him some cred back and here with Yeezus...hes not bothering with reception. Love it or hate it.<br /><br />It is literally the first album ive ever bought,listened to and then played again. I knew the songs were better than i had enjoyed them the first go-around. It was brash,it was weird,it was industry rap..what the >>> did i just listen to?<br /><br />Its in the second listen that you can appreciate the genius that is Yeezus. From hard synth melding with piano interludes, rock solo's and rap beats,screeches and heartfelt soul baring...its quite alot of fusion-in each individual song. (yes..i said 'fusion',remember i like Genesis and Brand X,so i have the word in my vocabulary)<br /><br />If your looking for a straight hip-hop album,the best 2 of the year have to be Magna Carta Holy Grail and Born Sinner,but whatever Mr West has released here is also one of the strongest albums of 2013. It wasnt just recorded or released..it was crafted.<br /><br />My top 5 picks: On Sight / Black Skinhead / New Slaves/ Hold My Liquor / Blood On The Leaves.  (Bound 2 was fun though)<br /><br />There is not a weak song on the album,with perhaps the exception of Guilt Trip which seems like a B-side,with a standard beat and no captivating lyrics. Quite simply...if you only listen to the album once,you'll feel you've wasted your money. The 2nd listen feels like an event.
B009R659L8|5.0|Took me some time to get into this book but once I did I could not put it down.  Each book is different and I love everyone.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I like it so much that I ordered another. This is the best stylus I found.  There are 3 tips.
B00C81LYH2|5.0|...sorry for being seized by the Stevie Wonder Syndrome but I was unable to resist--she's gorgeous.<br />A little background: I grew up during the days of the first two Barbies--the \\"ponytail\\" and the \\"bubble.\\" Sorry to have to say this, but Barbie's (as well as Midge's, Scooter's, et al.) quality was much higher in those days, so for those of my generation, the Barbies that have come since have all fallen somewhat short. However, that doesn't mean they're not beautiful and this is especially true of the Collector Series. Mind you, I'm not the one doing the collecting; fortunately there's a littl'un in my life who's about the \\"girliest\\" child ever born, still plays with dolls, and who adores Barbie. Not unpredictably, she went nuts over the 2013 Holiday Doll.<br /><br />This particular Collector is a vision in white, something I tend to be a sucker for in general. Her long blonde hair is a perfect complement, as are her blue eyes and rose-colored lips. Her earrings and gown are tastefully spangled and about the only thing I'd have changed is adding a pair of opera-length gloves. She appears to have walked out of the pages of a fairy tale. Everything seems to be of nice quality but I wish with all my heart that this most American of toys were still made here.<br /><br />As at least one other person has mentioned, the box in which Barbie resides is rather flimsy and really isn't appropriate for display, at least by discerning adult collectors. However, I can't complain about this too much since this particular doll is going to see active service with her owner albeit not until after Christmas. After the first viewing, she likes to put such \\"Auntie\\" gifts away until after holidays; she somehow feels that's a more appropriate way to take possession and who am I to argue?<br /><br />All in all, Barbie Collector 2013 Holiday Doll is a worthy addition to the Collector series, especially if the intended collector is a child. This Holiday Barbie is a perfect holiday gift forthe right little girl of any age.<br /><br />Update: It's worth noting that it's a tossup as to who is more besotted with Barbie Collector 2013 Holiday Doll--her new \\"mom\\" or her \\"grandma.\\"

0007288387|5.0|Yes I do like chick-lit every now and then and love most books by Kinsella, Weisberger, Potter and the like. Kelk was a logical choice. No this is not Shakespeare, but it is a good book when you're in the mood for a relatively shallow and of course completely predictable happy-end story. The character of Angela is relatable to some extent even though she does seem shockingly naive, but so do most characters in chick-lit (think Becky Bloomwood), and despite me being a feminist, this doesn't put me off the slightest - it's a fun read regardless. The story is hardly believable, especially the Jenny Lopez portion, but also here - who cares. Also, if you know and like or even love New York, this book allows you to easily daydream into the city. Being a massive fan of the Shopaholic series, 'I heart NY' was right up my alley and did not disappoint me in any way - just what I wanted for a light-hearted, fun read for my beach vacation.
B000ZN802W|5.0|This movie is the best portrayal of a young man trying to find his place in society.  Full of adventure and fun.
B0012CJQY6|5.0|The characters are all stereotypes but who cares. This is TV. It's just fun to watch. Even better you don't have to watch any ads.

B008B68IUY|4.0|Monster High toys and accessories are a huge hit with their fan base and the Travel Scaris Convertible vehicle is bound to be a big hit with kids who love Monster High. It is a stylish and attractive toy vehicle with a design that sets it apart from the average kid's toy vehicle.<br /><br />I'm not usually very impressed with toy vehicles because I have seen so many of them and because most of them look very similar. But this toy vehicle grabbed my attention. The cool, eye- catching, all- around design pattern is one that is bound to warrant a second look and both adults and kids alike will find that it easily stands out against other toy vehicles.<br /><br />Aside from the exterior, this Monster High vehicle does have other features that make it cool. The stylish wheels glide smoothly across a tile floor or a table without any problem and the vehicle seats up to four Monster High dolls. Rather than have all four dolls face forward, this convertible is a two- seat model with a pair of seats that are actually on top of the trunk, where the dolls face backward. Again, it's something unique that you don't find with other toy vehicles.<br /><br />The Monster High Travel Scaris Vehicle doesn't have any lights or sounds. This may bother some youngsters, but it is better from an adult perspective because it means no batteries to buy and more imagination required. Most kids will not mind anyway- they will find the vehicle so cool and fun that they will not even notice that it doesn't make noise or have any lights. And another advantage is that boys and girls both seem to like this toy. Girls like it because its Monster High and boys like it because, well, it's a vehicle, which is a toy normally associated with boys.<br /><br />This Monster High vehicle doesn't have opening side doors, and this is one quality that I wish was different because it would not only look cool, but it would also make it easier to place the dolls into the seats. But other than that, this is a fun, nice- looking toy that belongs in the home of every Monster High fan.ice- looking toy that belongs in the home of every Monster High fan.
B00005JKHN|3.0|I love this movie and it came quickly but the movie skips a little and I'm disappointed because even though it was used, it said it was \\"like new\\" so I didn't expect it to skip or I wouldn't have bought it
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I loved this movie.  It has great suspense but not too much awful gore.  I think that the ending shot was really what took it from a really good movie to a great one.  My husband disagree on the significance of it, but as an optimist, I like to think it was a happy ending.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|The four stars is the admiration of the movie. What I was most discourage about was it doesn't have unrated version because I know there is more to the movie. Especially when Mia is singing the creepy song from the original. I bet there going to make a unrated version soon. The product was good. It had good features and before warned it is widescreen. It also had a universal studios sweepstakes for the Evil Dead Maze which I enter quick and wife.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So far no problems with this app.  Works the way it should.  Download was effortless.  Very convenient to have a calculator on my smart phone.

B00336G7HI|5.0|I highly recommend this battery for your handycam. I used it quite a bit when I went on vacation for 5 days and never lost a charge. Now keep in mind I used it for a few minutes here and there. I did not record for 2 hours straight, although I bet it will hold up very well.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This was a fun intro game for new kindle users.  I've since grown tired of angry birds and have moved on to other games.  When I get tired of those, I might go back and play angry birds.  Don't know.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This is another amazing book from Mr. Baldacci.  I have<br />just recently started reading his books and they are<br />awesome.  So well written you can picture the characters<br />in your mind.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is a book about a young girl who commits suicide, before she does however she records 7 cassette tapes about the people who \\"made\\" her do it. She mails the tapes off to the first person on her list and they in turn mail them to the next person etc. The book is written from Clay's point in the story when he receives the tapes from a girl whom he had a crush on and does not understand what is going on and why he would be on her list.<br />This is a hard book to rate or review because of two sensitive subjects \\"bullying\\" and suicide. I put bullying in quotes because I am sure not everyone would agree with me that this is what happened to her but I would have to disagree about some of the kids. Hannah is not supposed to be the main person in this book as some reviews point out, this is more about Clay's feelings and reactions. Hannah is supposed to come off as putting blame on everyone else but herself after all the whole act of suicide is selfish.<br />One review mentioned that her daughter brought this book home from school as required reading and I think that is great! This book should be required reading in every school because so often we don't realize how we treat \\"that new girl\\" or \\"that girl that is always alone\\". I believe this book would really be able to touch and open many teenagers eyes to what we/they do to others without even giving it a second thought and how rumors can get out of hand even tho they seem fun and harmless at the time.<br />Highly recommended for every teen and every parent of a teen.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I was impressed .... I had ordered this unit because I had to replace what had been taken by my kids.  I got more than I had anticipated ... it was still in it's original cello wrap.

B00CWVFPGO|4.0|It was great to see Arnold come back into the acting world.  We absolutely loved this movie which was truly done in the traditional Schwarzenegger form.  I recommend this movie for those who like a lot of action and suspense.
B004ZN9J0K|4.0|It's a great album. It has it's moments where you want to skip to the next song but has some really good underrated songs on it like &#34;Let There Be More Light', &#34;Remember A Day&#34;, &#34;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&#34; and &#34;Jugband Blues.&#34; It's second and sadly the last Pink Floyd album to feature Syd Barrett but, overall is a pretty decent album.
006114665X|5.0|Very good read, detailed description of world events. Should be required reading in schools, so that future generations understand what happened during those difficult years.
0743455967|5.0|Stephen King takes a refreshing approach to writing a book about writing.  And, so much the better for the eager reader.  The book is divided into four parts.<br /><br />The first part is his &#34;C. V.&#34;, a highly enjoyable read about his family roots, how he started writing at a young age, and the origin of some of the ideas for his early books.  He was even bold enough to confess his alcohol and drug addictions.  And, better yet, he skewers the idea that an artist writes better &#34;under the influence.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Toolbox&#34;, part two, is a short, but concise section on basic rules of how not to write.  This section alone is worth the whole book.  It should be standard practice to have beginning writers read this section.  (When I read his advice on cutting adverbs, I went back to my drafts and began to take them out.)<br /><br />The third part, &#34;On Writing&#34; justly takes up half the book.  He insists that if one wants to write well, one should also read many things and many kinds of writing.  I wish had the life to follow his suggestion of spending my day reading and writing.  He writes that ideas for books he discovers like fossils in the ground.  Telling their story is like digging up the fossil and finding out about it.  He discusses everything from dialogue and language choice to ideal readers, editing and &#34;yeah but&#34;, the writer's desire to defend what his reader tells him is a problem.  My favorite piece of advice was &#34;Murder your darlings.&#34;  That is, cut those things you just thought had to be in there, but don't move your story forward.<br /><br />The last section &#34;On Living: a Postscript&#34; was about the accident along the road in Maine in which he was nearly killed.  This book was only about half done at the time of the accident and what he had to do to finish it.<br /><br />I've read other books on writing, but this was the easiest read with best tips to make my writing better.  I began to use some of them immediately.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Turning into my father and grandfather. At least the app makes me feel a little more modern. Great app works good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My title says it all! I adore Lady Violet... I could be her. Poor, poor Lady Mary. What WILL she do?
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I listen to this every day in my car.  Christina's voice is so powerful!  Although I can't sing a note, I sound good in the car!
032147404X|2.0|I bought this book hoping to review some simple things from my basic photography courses and how these things are different in a digital camera.  I was also hoping to use it with some friends of mine who have digital cameras, but don't understand aperture priority, shutter speed, depth of field, composition, and the camera's metering system.<br />This book assumes you know all that stuff and just goes from one tip to the other without really explaining why these tips work in relation to the bigger picture.  And, Kelby seems intent on selling lots of expensive gear that most of us could do without.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|...and to paraphrase someone's comment on a book, was, if that person could write a really in-depth review of the book, the person might as well read it applies to this.<br /><br />It is sweet, and warm, and comical, and kinda makes me wish *I* had a giant invisible pookah as my friend.  =^_^=
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Florence Welch has an incredible voice! Possibly one of my favorite female performers. Some songs may start a little slow, but give them a chance to pick up, like &#34;What The Water Gave Me&#34; and &#34;All This And Heave Too&#34; it'll be worth its. The lyrics are catchy and I don't think there is one song on this CD where the combination of instrumentals and her passionate voice doesn't give me goosebumps! &#34;Lover To Lover&#34; and &#34;Seven Devils&#34; are just a couple of my favs!
B002ZG976U|5.0|I enjoy watching this movie over and over.  Christina's voice gives me goose bumps! She's even a good actress.  Cher did a great job as well.
B004SDEP38|4.0|Haven't used the app uptil now but when opened and trued creating an app, worked fine and layout also seemed alright.
B000256TD0|5.0|If you are into Delorean cars and the Back To The Future movies this is a must have for your collection.  This model is well made and accurate in every detail.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Without a doubt, this was the movie I was most looking forward to and it did not disappoint.  It had the humour, heart, action and suspense that made it an enjoyable experience.  What I enjoyed most however was seeing the evolution of the crew dynamics.  You can see that they are gelling into the competent command team that's going to be the stuff of legend.<br /><br />The growth of the relationship between Kirk and Spock is brought across wonderfully.  Pine and Quinto have amazing chemistry that translates very well on screen.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch is superb as the villain and really brings his character to life.  Very mesmerizing and electric on screen.  He definitely stands out in the sea of bad guys that are flooding the box office this summer.<br /><br />Star Trek Into Darkness is the only movie so far that I have watched more than once in the cinema this summer and anxiously waited to pre-order.  I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment.<br /><br />My only peeve is the Spock/Uhura relationship which I  feel they can do away with it or just keep it off screen.  Not every movie needs to have some romantic element spliced into it.  That was the weakest part of the 2009 movie and the same in the sequel.<br /><br />I guess the romance subplot is to interest female moviegoers, but there are women like myself who can appreciate a strictly action and adventure movie. Furthermore, it just seems so unprofessional and belittles the characters.  I cringe whenever I recall the scene in the shuttle.<br /><br />Beyond that, outstanding job by cast and crew.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cool horse app!  you can run them around and care for them and compete in championships!  Sure glad I got this one!
B00C4QE04K|5.0|I have always been a Jonny Depp fan. He is a versatile actor. His portrayal of the \\"Worst Director of All Time\\" is funny and poignant at the same time. Martin Landau won an Oscar for his portrayal of Bela Lugosi. It is a very fun ride.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love this series and so happy when it arrived all brand new, unopened and ready to go!  Will do business with this vendor again for sure! ! !
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Fun book! I enjoyed the fast pace of the novel. This was a very entertaining book and I can't wait to read the next one.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Acting is phenomenal and the plot continues to excite the viewer. Savor each episode and thanks Amazon for making this so affordable.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy watching this show. I can't wait to find out where the relationships in this show are going.
0515153656|3.0|The book is a good read but don't expect too much of it, it's fairly predictable.  Worth reading if you're stuck in the airport.
B001N9ESQ4|3.0|This definitely feels like a filler movie. Just enough explanatory power to to keep you engaged but now we need to see the last one, Before Midnight. It's also disappointing in the way they both overly romanticize a one night stand which causes them to lose perspective in their current relationships.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|This was entertaining but i am glad that I didn't drop $50 to take the family to the movies when it was in the theatres. Good characters, with the exception of the dad. He was weak...
B009T3AE1Y|5.0|This movie is very disturbing. The main character is really off the wall. Rob is so good that you almost feel<br />what he is feeling. At times it can be confusing, but it keeps you wanting more.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is one the few Christmas movies that my whole family -of 7- can agree on...it was an instant holiday classic!  From kindergarteners to teenagers to parents, we all love it.  Great story and excellent graphics.  If you haven't seen it, you must.  And if you have seen it, you'll want to own it.  Also makes a great gift for other families!
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|This DVD was for our grandson that lives in a different state<br />Mom has reported that he loves this and watches it often!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|It was so good to watch the entire season in a weekend. Please tell me there will be season 4
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I recently viewed this film at a public library and knew I had to own my own copy.  It would be sufficiently intriguing if not a true story but it's overwhelming because it is true.  Rodriguez himself epitomizes talent plus humility, always working by the sweat of his brow and expecting nothing he hasn't earned.  His daughters are amazing, adding tremendously to the unfolding of the story.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Very entertaining game. Kept me busy for hours. Love the graphics and storyline. Love the combo action of hidden objects and mini games as the game progressed. Would have liked to have returned the jewel to the statue myself, but overall a great game.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was such a page turner! I love every second of it. One minute I was crying my eyes out and the next minute my heart was so warm and comforted. MUST READ!!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is a fun app. I have the original Free Flow and this is as good as that game.  H ave FUN with it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I admit I had a hard time getting into this series. It is one I really have to pay attention to. No multi-tasking while I watch TV but wow is it good. So glad I stuck with it. REALLY looking forward to season 4.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is hard but a lot of fun to play. The weapons are neat. I would like to be able to have a different minion.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Absolutely love Il Divo. Their voices blend so beautifully and powerfully! I have all of their CDs and really enjoy this one because it has many of my favorite songs from past CDs. Their voices give me goose-bumps.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What a great book! Love the challenges she has created for these characters.  This is one i will read over and over again.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Who dosent love Robert Downy Jr.?  He's wonderful and so is this movie. My 10YO daughters favorite film series right now.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Awesome game...really has the feel of the original card game. The only thing I'd add is the ability to add on to draw 2 cards...like in the card game.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|Khaled Hosseini does such a wonderful job of taking us to this far off and so different land.I left this book feeling like I knew the people and places he had introduced me to  but more importantly it lrft me with a deep understanding and compasion for the Afghanistan people. I would reccomend it for everyone
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Very creative power structure. Enjoyable development of this world, so similar and yet so different from our own. A creative masterpiece
B006JTS5OO|5.0|yes to the moive its everything that i would have wanted out of a muppets movie i loved it supper good
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|An excellent visual crossover from the book. A few minor detais were missing, but I'm sure the book fans would notice and no need to point them out. Fans of the LOTR films will look forward to a great story.
B003VANOFY|5.0|What a complete package these are! You owe it to yourself to get these, if  you game for over three hours daily,  you need to own these.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|I really want to like this product.  I gave this 2 stars because I love the concept.  However, the quality is below standard.  I've had this for less than a month and the base plate is now falling apart.  It's as if the plastic piece which the mouse sits on, is not glue well together.  Also, it never fully charges.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I found this very interesting reading especially about music therapy.  I wish I knew that much about music.  I recommended this book to a co-worker and friend who mother has dementia.  I hope it opens more people hearts and minds to other live styles.  I wonder what the percentages would be if everyone could be who they are and not afraid.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|I don't go to the movies much any more because of the cost of the tickets, I am so glad that I went to see White house down. Great action film kept me very entertained.  It was nice to see action that doesn't come with alot of swearing and nudity.  If you want to just seat back and enjoy a great action film that keeps you entertained with out foul language and no nutity this is a movie you don't want to miss.  I hope everyone enjys this movie as mcuh as I did.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|The Innocent was a fun, if somewhat predictable read. Baldacci keeps a story moving quickly and doesn't get bogged down in lengthy descriptions. On the other hand, his editor should tell him repetitiveness and choppy sentences need to be broken up by longer clauses to create a smooth read. I would recommend the book, though, and will read the next in the series.
B005OGYH90|5.0|Great sound, great set list, amazing performance and a very nice packaging. You can feel the energy of the band. It's a powerful record.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|Vivid, sharp picture quality of the blu-ray edition is phenomenal for this 80 year old classic, yes there is some grain but it's pretty minimal and doesn't distract at all except for a couple of fog sequences aboard ship. The digi-book package is gorgeous.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Well written and interesting soliloquy with a rhythm of after thought like a slow dance with a quick beat.  One's not far into it when you know you are going to finish it.
B009SKPVO8|4.0|the strap is nice and well made, although when in use it will tend to move on your shoulder.<br />i wish the pad was grippier to end the constant readjustments.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Once the fighting started I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 days without much sleep. I would recommend this book to anyone
B00CFA225Y|4.0|My husband said it was a good movie and the 3d was very good. he enjoyed it alot and has watched it several times already.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I watched the first episode with a friend and I ended up watching the remaining episodes over the following couple of days. (It is worth watching a second time with my friend.) By the end of the second episode I was pulled in and every by the end of the season my jaw had dropped too many times to count. I can't wait for the next season! Although fiction, it makes me look at current political events through the filter of this show.<br /><br />A Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) quote that sums up the series for me:<br />\\"He chose money over power, in this town a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years, power is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I can not respect someone who does not see the difference.\\"<br /><br />Also House of Cards was just nominated for 9 Emmy awards! Not surprising at all. Great series, do not hesitate to
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I'm in episode 1 as the outgoing first lady and in episodes 5 & 6 as a reporter.  I love it!!
B0092SQ5EG|1.0|It was Stupid!!!  I would rather watch a re-make of Saved by the BELL<br />the college Years with the nerd Screech!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|MY DAUGHTER AND I love playing this game.  She is always so excited when she wins. I get frustrated sometimes.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Heard about it from a friend.<br />Too many names and places to keep up with.<br />Will read the rest of the books.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I like the app. It's nice to play while passing time or trying to fall asleep. It is also a good game to have the kids play too.
B00AQCMK32|4.0|Not much to say, nice game, nothing to die for. For 99 cents I would say it was worth it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app. Currently working on a food journal and I love the convenience of being able to access my notebooks through my phone and tablet.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The story line was interesting and suspenseful. Kept my attention. The ending was a let down that was the adisappointing
B008JFLWLE|4.0|A friend recommended this to me to help me in class, but it wouldn't do certain problems that I had. I'm assuming that I might have to write it a different way or it just really doesn't do all problems.
B008JF8O9M|3.0|so far, on my kindle fire, i can only get the test page to print... there are no options to print from the browser or the documents app.  i'm going to keep looking but i expect failure
B001UE27X8|5.0|What's not to like here?  My favorite vocalist and my favorite pianist together...  Until this CD came out, I had only heard a few songs that they had recorded together, and I was totally taken with those recordings.  But this CD not only contains both albums they recorded together in their entirety, but also a huge amount of delicious out-takes.  So very glad I purchased this!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|great story line. lbut your gonna need to do lots of low level grinding to earn gold for new armour if you want to avoid spending real money on gems. such an awesome game i cant believe its free.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted to this app, on the computer, phone, and kindle! This app is very user friendly on the kindle and I had no problems with any updates.
B000JXYJMI|2.0|Buyer beware!  Make sure you notice what &#34;region&#34; the DVD is for (didn't know there WERE regions until now!) because if you don't read the warning towards the bottom of the order screen, you might end up with a DVD that will not play on most players sold in the U.S. or Canada!
B000L53D4O|4.0|My 12 month old granddaughter explored all the buttons and flaps on this toy, and it was obvious that she was disappointed that it did not play music or make noise.  She has shown only mild interest in it as a walker, because she always ends up trying to push it from the front and then she steps on it.  She might have enjoyed playing with it in the folded position when she was a little younger, but at 12 months, she's pretty bored with it.
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|Good movie from 2013, has adult and child humor.  More story line that expected for a children's film. We enjoy it as a family.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have enjoy the Eva and Gideon story so far. I want them to be together and happy at the end of story.  How ever I am pissed that no date was given for the fourth book.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Children will love this movie. I think ages 3 and up will enjoy watching the movie but don't just put it on and leave. There is plenty of adventure and special effects to keep an adult happy and entertained.
B00C81AVNU|3.0|Having loved the original movie, and eager to hear the music from the Broadway Play, I think I expected too much?  Sadly I was very disappointed.  I know Cyndi Lauper can do MUCH better, AND Harvey Firestein too.  I know it won the TONY Award for best musical & obviously the pickins were slim this year?  I really did expect hit songs, even some good dance mixes from it.  What I got instead was very basic music, nothing too stirring & I got bored by the 2nd or 3rd song.  Still I listened to the end with no better results.  If I'd heard it first I would not have purchased it & this saddens me.  Oh well......live & learn. Glad I have the original movie to keep watching, now THERE'S a HIT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is the best game in the world I love it you get to take care of your own horse compete and everything and you don't. have to woody about. it. getting. sick
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you really want a work out that will kick your but into shape this is it!!! It has multiple levels which is nice so you can start at beginner and work your way up.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is so much fun its also challenging playing the game makes your mind work harder and makes you think a lot
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Could b WAAAYYY better...notifications dont show up EVER n some show up hours later some 10 or more minutes later
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I was surprised by this game, the quality is great for what you're paying for it. The graphics and sound fit the game perfectly and the content/play is fun for all ages. The biggest downside to this game is with its DLC, which is a non-issue since you don't have to buy any of it to enjoy the game fully, the problem that I do have with it is that you're buying characters without any added campaigns or missions for them - something I'd gladly purchase for this if it were the right price (one of the solo characters is $5.99, more than twice the game itself!). Overall Id recommend this game to anyone, you can pick it up and play for hours, or just a mission or two here and there when you have time and put your time in that way, no problems.<br /><br />For $1.99, this game is a must-buy. Release more playable content please!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is wonderful...... keeps you entertained. I would definitely recommend using this app. Fun for not only kids but adults!
B00195BM3Y|4.0|If you like echo and the bunnymen, or the cure, or any other eighties music of the darker variety, you must give this a listen. Music quality on CD is good, but could be better.
B008KE3960|5.0|Recovering from surgery needed something to do,this game keeps me busy and is actually fun. Challenging without being frustrating. Only complaint is my big fingers sometimes have trouble creating the flight path that I want. Other than that game rocks!
B00992CF6W|3.0|Great game to play. Now it's time to make it better and more like the PC version. Could use some underground navigation references.
034580404X|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who is a hopeless romantic and likes to get &#34;dirty&#34; every now and then. I couldn't put it down! phenomenal and a must read for sure! soooo looking forward to the movie....just cant wait to see who will be casted for Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele.....the suspense is killing me!! please write more books!!  impatient in NY
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Waste hrs upon hrs just having fun<br />My 4yr old enjoys it also, the graphics are great for small devices and my nexus 7runs the game flawlessly this is a must have game for fun. Large file size must be downloaded via wifi but its worth it. Get all the jewels to fill the todem pole head gear as you play each level
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I have the 1rst but this one is way way better and it has more guys but I gut to wave 37 on the 2nd I got up to 69im still stuck but its rilly fun
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|they did a great job! I grew up on the books, dad reading them to me at night. You will love it
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This app makes uploading movies and video's simple and works with all.the formats I use .  Would recommend to all.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm sure if I did this workout for 30 days as suggested, the weight would be falling off.  Jillian kicks your butt, but it's great.  I've only been doing it on days I can't make it to the gym, but it's a great video and makes you sweat!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing and fun for all ages! And if anybody ask me if I know a good game I will recommend this!
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|I really didint know what to expect from this show but I was throughly impressed with the history channel with this one.<br />I enjoyed the show and it sets up nicely for the next episode and I cant wait to watch it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|A pleasant diversion. Fast paced and challenging at times. A score card would be nice.  Overall a very good time.
B000M341RI|5.0|all around goofy British movie with endearing but manly characters. I've never caught the whole movie (tee hee) at one time, so I bought it for myself. Fun watch - good plot and I love love love Robert Carlyle. great amazon seller - I recommend this dealer.
B008Y1RTUG|1.0|They remade the Disney original and it wasn't so good.  It was very violent and the story dragged on and on.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This animation of this is remarkable. It is so cute, love I can build my reef, get sand $$, or algae to grow.!! attracts rare fish to your reef.  Wonderful & addictive!!
B005IQ39AY|2.0|This game was fun until it started failing in the middle of a game.  The first time it happened I had 380 balls so I wasn't even close to running out.  All of a sudden no ball appeared in the little box down on the right and the fail screen popped up.  Another time a much smaller ball appeared and once that was shot, the fail screen appeared.  Yet another time nothing but rainbow balls appeared even after all the target balls were gone.  Once it failed the first time then it just kept happening, level 3 or 14 or 26 or 39, it didn't matter.  Uninstalling and reinstalling made zero difference.  There seem to be lots of versions of this type of game out there, so try someone else's.  Bubbles Touch will just end up frustrating you. NOT recommended.
B00A2H9L2E|1.0|The first is still one of my favorite horror movies of all time.  Then they kinda s*** this one out.  The plot, the characters, storyline...all sucked.  I damn near had to mainline Red Bull to stay away through it.  They seriously took the piss out of this one.
0545265355|5.0|Bought this for my Mom, she had already read the series once, got it from the library. But she started it all over again once she got her own copies. It kept her up late into the night many times, she sent me a text at 2 in the morning when she finished it, just to say thank you again.
0061733199|5.0|Some very valid information in this book, some of the info is redundant or obvious, but could help someone in a crisis situation who needs to ground themselves in the basics and control fear.  Knowledge always dispels fear, and having this book on hand is a piece of mind.  Easy to read and reference, a teenager could use the info successfully.  Good pictures and descriptions.  Probably the best &#34;all-around&#34; book to have on hand.  Does not try to specialize in any one area, very broad coverage of topics, and touches on some things that were actually new to me.
0061452068|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but I tend to agree with the critics. As I went along and started to hear claims about technology innovation which is close to my field of expertise, I realized that many claims were incorrect or at least contrary to my understanding of history and how things work (e.g., the role of government in fostering innovation). This made me lose confidence in the book as a whole. Nonetheless Matt offers an interesting argument and it is thought provoking. I think the most rational reaction to reading it should be skepticism.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second is the favorite of the franchise. The night scenes and the \\"hearts and flowers\\"equal each other, I'm so happy for them!
B00697VQEC|5.0|I can't believe it! This is the real thing! Oh my GOD !!! My dad & sister didn't even think that this was even an actual record by them.
B00DHNBY02|5.0|Best horror movie ever!!! (But not better than the original). I really enjoyed seeing elements from all 3 Evil Dead movies.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love the application gives me my batter life in % . So much easier to see when I need to charge the battery.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Graphics are smooth.  Realistic interactions.  Genuine sounds.  Learn about horses.  Keeps the mind active.  Economic. I do wish the app would be more descriptive in how to earn points.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|sooooooooooo good but the resin why I gave 4 stars is I play less of angry birds! I will play that now!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I got these headphones about 3 years ago, and I've worn them so much that I actually took of the ear pads from my dad's unused old pair of K 240s and put them on here. Although the pads have worn out, the sound hasn't! After 3 years of daily listening, they still sound the same they did when I bought them, and even better! To this day, I still need to find a pair that sounds better in the price range. They sound fuller and have a better soundstage than the ATH-M50s, and they actually sound a lot better than the more expensive AKG K 271s. I'd say these have amazing balance; the bass is perfect, mids are just as they should be, and highs are not piercing but are perfectly blended in to the texture. They sound like they should be much more expensive, so you should get them now before they go up in price!
B0084670FU|3.0|Ok but not a must see by any means. Brad Pitt has a small role - his character is not the lead of the movie.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|interesting, great character development, funny, exceptional acting, this show has it all. easily one of the best shows ive ever seen
B003H4I4JU|2.0|If I can ever get into this book, I might raise the star level.  But to be honest, this is very disappointing when compared with the first book  I was ready to buy them all after I finished Enders Game.... I've moved on to other books.  When I get bored or need some sleep, I'll come back to this one.  Hopefully it picks up
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun like subway surfers but more awesome and fun!!!!!!<br />I like trying to defeat vector and others to be minion of the year!!!!!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|When you hear about a book for ten years, it's about time to read it. And I did so without regret.<br /><br />When a book changes the way I see the world, I put it on the top shelf with other 5-star books. This one has that impact. Gladwell illustrates that success can have as much to do with luck (hockey players born on January 1) as it does with hard work (rice paddy workers), culture (Korean pilots) and language (Chinese mathematics).<br /><br />Gladwell's writing is engaging. Even the lengthy back stories are as captivating as the analysis of success. The divergent paths of Oppenheimer and Langan, both geniuses, is particularly fascinating when examining how childhood shaped their views of the world and, as a result, the expression of their intelligence.<br /><br />Gladwell's summary of measuring IQ is also illuminating. While many of us still assume (to some extent) that intelligence can be measured by memorization and processing power, the impact of creativity on intelligence is inspiring.<br /><br />Finally, the 10,000 hour rule. It takes a person 10,000 hours of practice to maximize their potential at any particular skill. I now find myself adding up the numbers of everything I do. There's something comforting about having that number.<br /><br />Yes, read this. Or listen to it (like I did).

0439813786|5.0|Book Review:The Invention of<br />Hugo Cabret<br />​<br />July 18, 2013<br /><br />​Title: The Invention of Hugo Cabret<br /><br />Author: Brian Selznick<br /><br />​Genre: Juvenile Fiction<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />I've been meaning  to read The Invention of Hugo Cabret, written by Brian Selznick, for quite a while. Well, last night I actually got around to doing it and boy am I glad I did.The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a delightful story both written and illustrated by the same person. This is the type of book that will be passed down for generations as the story as a peculiar charm to it that is sure to entertain young children and adults alike. This lovely book is set up in an unusual way: part novel, part comic strips and part pictures to go along with the words. With over 250 pages of pictures, The Invention of Hugo Cabret brings to life the story being told.<br /><br />It is often said that a picture is worth 1000 words, yet at the same time, there some feelings that can be expressed as a picture. This novel combines both pictures and words into one huge masterpiece to capture exactly the message the author is trying to convey to readers. The close up drawings of the characters allowed me to really connect with them--I felt as if I knew them inside and out.<br /><br />The story is also wonderfully written. The writing style reminds me of a \\"classic\\" novel (meaning Charlotte's Web, The Boy in Striped Pajamas, etc.) There are no excessive words. Every sentence is carefully measured out and put together.  The Invention of Hugo Cabret tells the tale of a 12 year old boy named Hugo. Hugo's caretaker--his uncle--died a few months ago and Hugo can't let anyone find out or else he would be sent to the orphanage. Since his uncle was the clock keeper at a train station, it is now up to Hugo to ensure that all the clocks are ticking on time. No one ever suspects it was a young boy overseeing the clocks at the station. Hugo lives between the walls of the trainstation in a secret room. All his life's treasures are stored up there, including a broken automaton left behind by his dead father.<br /><br />One day, Hugo is caught stealing a toy from a toy booth at the station. The toy booth owner took Hugo's journal, a worn out book Hugo kept in his pockets all the time. Hugo is devastated by his loss because inside the journal was sketches on how to fix the broken automaton drawn by his father. With the help of a girl with an affinity for books, Hugo manages to strike up a deal with the toy booth owner: in return for working at the booth, maybe the journal will be returned to Hugo.  As an unlikely friendship develops between Hugo, the girl and an one-eyed man, they embark on a journey that will lead to the uncovering of a long lost secret.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about The Invention of Hugo Cabret is that it makes me feel pretty accomplished when I finished reading it. Yeah, more than half the pages are illustrations. But still--I finished a 500+ page book in 45 minutes! That's something I can brag about to my friends, right? :-)<br /><br />Likes:<br />  *loved the plot<br />  *Lovely pictures<br />  *didffernt from your typical novel<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />  *sometimes I felt that Hugo and the girl acted irrationally....but they're kids, so I guess I can let that slide

B00BXKKNFS|2.0|It does what it says, it stops the adds, but it slows everything else down to a crawl, and slower. disabled it
B0091V6TF4|5.0|We enjoy the music, all the original artists AND the fact that the themes are arranged in chronologic order of the movies. It helped us out watching the movies in order (checking them out of the library).
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|My first in this series  and it was entertaining. A lot of characters with different personality traits keep it interesting.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Very good movie. Only problem was the buffering when being streamed. Probably due to,our Internet I would imagine. Will watch more movies now that my Samsung tv offers Amazon streaming.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Hilarious, just like 30 Rock! Tina Fey manages to make fun of herself and relates to her audience. I enjoyed learning more about her life!
B009P3N1GI|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's novella is a super read.  Well written and paced, with an original take on art and the ideas of originality and greatness.<br /><br />Definitely worth purchasing, and enjoy this light read!

B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was an easy and quick read.  The author did a wonderful job,of blending the past,with the present and exploring the two main characters lives.  I highly recommend this book for a great summer read.

630460288X|5.0|Buck Rogers without the spaceships is how I would describe this movie. A man is suspended in cryostasis(I hope I spelled that right) until he is &#34;thawed&#34; decades later. He finds himself in a new world where lots of things have changed. However, corruption is always somewhere and when he finds it, the bad guys thaw out one of his original enemies, but not before they turn him into a genetic miracle(or nightmare in this case; the guy is a dangerous criminal). Buck Rogers meets Judge Dredd. 'Nuff said.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is great. Its cool, has good graphics and sounds. The only thing is when I first got it, it was a black screen. Some of you have not made a comment about this because maybe your to mad. So I removed it. Then, I downloaded it again and then I could actually play it so if this happens READ THIS.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is way better than the windows 8 version. Nice clear game graphics and smooth play. One of the best games around.<br />Sherab
630018403X|5.0|One of my favorite dramas ever made. Do not let the young cast of stars fool you, this is premium acting at it's finest. Teenage angst and anger meet with outstanding acting. Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and many, many more stars appear in this masterpiece. If you like your drama 80's style with some of the best performances I have ever seen in a drama, THIS IS IT! Highest possible recommendation!
B0050DZN4K|2.0|Having never used an app to aggregate all of the blogs I follow, this took me a good part of a couple of days to figure out.  I thought I would be able to read articles and blogs on my Kindle while not connected to wi-fi (while waiting for kids at sports, etc) but cannot.  Also if there are links within an article for videos or external links to websites you can not get to it from Feedly, even while on wi-fi at home.  You need to exit Feedly and get to the article's links or video directly thru the web.  Sort of defeats my purpose of taking all the time to set this up to gain efficiencies.  If anyone has found something better for my needs please advise!
0425263924|5.0|I disagree with those that didn't enjoy this book. This is not a trilogy, it's a quintette so of course it won't just end here. This book was very good and answered so many questions that I've had, and those that didn't like all the sex, then I don't understand how you liked the other books knowing that this is a big part of the the characters in this book. I thought the book was great and love the fact that there is more to come with Gideon and Eva. Anyone who enjoyed the first two will enjoy the rest as well.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I love the music from the movie so I got the soundtrack. If you enjoyed the music when you were watching the film, here is your chance to hear the good music again. Enjoy!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I enjoy all these movies and they stand the test of time.  Getting them in bluray made sense, and the packaging is very nice.  Looking forward to seeing them over and over.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love this show! Nothing vulgar, no cussing, no nudity. I was born in England so I just love seeing the historic houses, countryside, clothing, and hearing the old accent.
B00B3HJMLM|5.0|I really love Luke Bryan and it was nice to get some new songs. I just wish that there weren't so many repeats on this one. Still great though.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|One for all office tasks I need.<br />Great software especially when it free for user.<br />Thanks Amazon community.<br />Love it
B00AQNOCZ0|4.0|I actually do like this collection, the only 'complaint' I would have is the marking on the discs. I know this sounds weird but they are hard to see with all the dark colors. My wife and I bought them after seeing one of the movies and have been watching them in order to bring ourselves up to date. we actually got them out of order twice (old eyes don'tcha know).<br /><br />That said, HP is quite interesting and we have been enjoying the series. Now we have to read the books...  aloha
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was gripping. I began reading at 2am, and I could put it down. It straddles so many point I e come across in documentaries, biographies and conversations with my fellow peers. It's almost a roadmap revealing one's inner potential and outlines to become they best you could be.<br /><br />For those curious out there, look this one over and think really deep and every intersection.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The only other book I have read aside from the diary of a young girl by Anne Frank that made me cry. Very real. And the coincidence is fitting.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|I just received this app but it keep going off.  Not what I expected. Nothing for Maine. Just one station for northern Me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK,I wish that Suzanne Collins would had continued the books and the story my heart is begging for more.
0441172717|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone, be them sci-fi fans or not. Herbert's prose are truly breathtaking. He created a style that is unmatched and beyond the technical and mythological content, his understanding of human emotion is self revealing. I found myself nodding while I read this book, agreeing with his insights.<br /><br />A great work everyone should read.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Fun read<br />All should read once. It is a nice treasure hunt that brings you to a well-known time in history. Some tough vocab, but good overall.
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app is not user friendly hard to negotiate around inside it. So I am going to delete it! Can't get the my location to reflect my location.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was very surprised by how the story sucked me in.  The action scenes are written in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I LOVE this show!  From the actors to the sets and the stories they really hit the mark with this series.  I hope it continues for many seasons!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun solving the puzzles.  not too hard, but just challenging enough to enjoy.  wish there were more floors to explore.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tis was an amazing book. Don't read the reviews just go read it! You won't regret it! Even better from the hero pov
B004UID2LC|2.0|I thought this app was great, but recent updates have ruined it. Ads that block parts of the video, really? Lame. Once I find a similar app this one is gone...
B000007MVD|5.0|like the unexpected freshness of an old song that pops up unexpectedly, this is a portal to a time passed that  --  for most of the u.s. audience -- is still new.  you get to be a teenager once in a lifetime, and this was mine.  thank god for the nameless heads, hands and feet who gathered, labeled, shelved and preserved the tapes; without them there'd be only the faint echo of memory.  here, it springs back to life, with the added pleasure of conjuring what some kid was doing on a saturday night in london while you were doing your own growing up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is SO much fun!!!!! The only bad thing is that the loading takes forever but everything else is  great :D
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|recent update places unavoidable ads in game.  I really like this game so it was disappointing to have to rate it so poorly. hope they change it, but I doubt they will
B000002KXV|5.0|i hesitate to add an adjective to what is known and discoverable about this classic.  perhaps to say that it conjurs up pieces of every overnight dj you ever ran into at home or on the road is enough; it's the atmospherics behind the music that drives  &#34;the nightfly&#34;  way beyond ordinary.  and then there's the music; it's excellent  --  a noun; no adjectives.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A little challenging in spots but if you stick with it you will figure it out....it's well worth the money and can't wait for more rooms to come in the future. It makes you use your brain and that is a good thing...not like the mindless dribble that comes in some other games.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|This game was amazing untill it crashed twice on me. Don't even bother with it. As soon as you get to a high level the game will crash.
B000UMXCTY|5.0|the british put where value where it counts: sound quality and packaging  --  sturdy box, crisp sleeves.  the miniaturized covers are a treat to someone who owns the original lps, although i still miss the information loads that album covers, sleeves and inserts used to carry. formerly, when someone lit you up with an instrumental solo or backing vocal you could find who it was; unfortunately no longer true. i miss the richness of vinyl sound too, and no one warned me that it would be a cost of aging, but, hey -- what are you gonna do?  cars don't have tail fins and acres of sheet metal anymore either. yet the song remains the same, and here's a really good way to get to it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Many of my friends tried to get me to watch it and I was resistant but so happy I did.  Great writing, story telling and acting.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games is a fantasitc movie experience, one that'll have you on your seat for much of the time. Can't wait to see the sequel.
B008UTV6S8|3.0|a longtime fan of simon (and simon&garfield), i put a bunch of his stuff in my music box & this was a lesser part of the stash --  for the usual outdoor concert reasons:  up-and-down sound compared to indoor & studio; song versions that seem at this distance to have been included more for fan expectation than from his own interest.  this will be read as a complaint but it shouldn't be; life is a joyride and if every experience was graded &#34;a&#34; it would be pretty boring.
B000IVW25M|2.0|Movie seems kind of boot leg and when i recieved it in the mail it had a stench on cigarettes all over and inside the case.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Joe really has dropped a gem. The production is top notch from start to finish. The features are placed perfectly throughout the album. The content is easy listening and this album has replay value for years to come. I congratulate JOE on having an ear for what the fans really wanted to hear. I suggest music lovers cop this album and enjoy the sounds of true r n b.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it! I enjoy this game.  been playing it for a year but had to start over Bc of a kindle problem.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|I love RAM mounts.  There is a mount for everything!  I used this on my trolling motor and it keeps it solid.  This mounted to my rail on my boat.  It mounted solid with seemingly no chance of spinning and damaging my rail.
B0018OFN2W|2.0|Not as good as the first one, but worth the watch if there absolutely nothing else on. Check It out.
B008220BLG|4.0|it wasn't a bad movie but it was a little boring  at times...i would have likes a little more action...in the beginning...it started out okay but then it seem to stretch it out then again got better towards the end....it was entertaining ...i should have rented first before i had brought it...
B0058W74UY|1.0|took more time to figure out it would not help me then I wanted to even deal with at least it was easy to unistall!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Great movie, very funny. Fans of &#34;The Office&#34; will love Oscar Nuñez's performance. Shirtless Ryan Reynolds is nice too. :-)
B005IQZB14|4.0|Gripping story of a young woman's journey to challenge everything in her life and self.  Well written and excellent descriptions of her emotions, her mistakes, etc...good read
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very fun to play.  It is a great way to pass the time.  The levels challenge your brain and help you increase your memory skills.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|This is one of the better Dr. Panda games that we have tried. My three year old just loves to fix things for the animals. Very cute.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|The pacing and the movement of the story in book 3 was just right. The story has gotten even more complex without losing its focus. Tons of surprises.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|Fantastic read. You start to think one thing is going to happen, then she turns it all around again. I love the way she writes and sets up her books as well as how connected she can make you feel to her characters (even the ones you so adamantly disagree with).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its extremely fun I would play it all day long. This game is one of those games that can definitely get you hoked.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|so fun it is an awesome game.if you want this game you should really get it I want the full version
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Although I know there are some historical inaccuracies...the series has me hooked! I will hate getting to the final episode!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|It's remarkable that in a genre expressly designed to scare people, so few of its entries actually accomplish that goal. But The Conjuring absolutely does. Smarter and more consistent than all of the Paranormal Activity films put together, James Wan's interim project between Insidious installments exudes both studio respectability and grindhouse urgency.<br /><br />All of which is why hyperbole aside, The Conjuring is the closest thing to a horror classic modern audiences are likely to get, particularly in an era when genre offerings seem to be at their most disposable.<br /><br />Ron Livingston (Dinner For Schmucks) and Lily Taylor (Being Flynn) play Roger and Carolyn Perron, parents of a quartet of girls who move into a Rhode Island farmhouse only to quickly discover that it's possessed by supernatural forces. After exhausting all possibilities of dealing with the unseen menace, Roger reaches out to Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), well-known paranormal researchers who have a reputation for eliminating similar threats. But even the veteran investigators begin to think they may be in over their heads after the evil force initiates increasingly violent attacks on the Perrons, forcing them to confront their own painful past as they try to help Roger and Carolyn preserve their family's future.<br /><br />Although it certainly utilizes many of the hallmarks of other recent paranormal, possession-oriented movies in order to exert its influence on the audience, The Conjuring succeeds for three reasons which might not seem obvious except in comparison to their absence in those predecessors. The first of these is the fact that it's consistent: from the film's opening scenes to its finale, something is always happening. In the Paranormal Activity films, for example, much time is devoted to introducing the characters and then feebly attempting to justify the constant use of cameras in every corner of the house. In Wan's film, the first scene highlights the Warrens' expertise with a \\"case study\\" featuring a particularly creepy doll, and the last resolves the escalation of supernatural activity that takes place in the Perrons' home. And in between, virtually every passing day and night features at least one frightening moment, often repeated in just a delicate enough way that it both keeps the threat palpable while allowing space for it to evolve or intensify.<br /><br />Secondarily, what happens to the Perrons happens to all of them. In far too many horror movies, one character will find him- or herself persistently attacked by some evil force, only for no one else around him or her to see it. As a result much of the film's running time is spent questioning whether or not anything is truly happening. In The Conjuring, the supernatural force essentially goes after anyone and everyone in the Perron family indiscriminately, creating unpredictability --and maybe more importantly, a collective acceptance that this is occurring --that keeps the characters and the audience on edge.<br /><br />Third, the film (or the characters) makes almost no stupid decisions, which is a rarity in a film of any sort these days, but is exceptional in a horror film where, as a byproduct of poor writing or maybe just storytelling necessity, they seem to occur with maddening frequency. In fact, there's a completeness to Wan's vision here that seems to preclude even the possibility of stupidity: the characters take rational steps to explore and address the supernatural problem. The movie gives them the credit of being blindsided by this evil force rather than having them more or less submit themselves to scenarios where scary stuff occurs. And once the investigators join the Perrons in the house, they set up cameras and recording devices in every corner. This creates a sort of first-generation found footage movie within a movie, and eliminates the \\"nobody believes me\\" argument from the characters' usual repertoire of excuses why their problems continue to intensify.<br /><br />Wan's interest in making an old-fashioned studio horror film pays off handsomely, because it showcases both the creativity that he developed on independent and low-budget projects and the refinement and maturity he achieved while making those movies. While the movie doesn't skimp on gruesome imagery of ghastly figures and evil spirits, some of its greatest moments of suspense occur while little girls are peering, terrified, into dark corners of their bedrooms where there seems to be no one at all. This sort of expert audience manipulation doesn't come purely from scrimping and saving and working within budgetary constraints that prohibit the filmmakers from showing their monsters. It comes from truly understanding what is scary and how to maximize that suspense,with or without the money to show the monster that will eventually invade viewers' nightmares.<br /><br />Evidently, The Conjuring is based on case files of the real Ed and Lorraine Warren, who also investigated the house that would become the setting of the iconic `70s horror film The Amityville Horror. I can't speak to the film's accuracy in depicting the events in question, and I generally speaking have no sense of spirituality to bounce off of the events in the film. But there are things in Wan's film that, for the sake of me sleeping soundly, I'd prefer never to see again. The Conjuring creates such an intense and consistent atmosphere of suspense that I would give it my highest recommendations, and yet it's something I will probably never watch again.<br /><br />That said, it's not perfect; the \\"case study\\" footage at the beginning, for example, is assembled half as a collection of clinical interviews and half as a mini-horror movie. A later return to that storyline --inside the Warrens' house while Ed attempts to stage an impromptu exorcism at the Perrons' pays off in terror, but it doesn't make a whole lot of sense logistically. And some of the finale in the Perrons' house unfolds more like Evil Dead than a bona fide demonic possession, whatever that would perhaps more plausibly look like. But in a movie where shadows are as scary as the most detailed monster make-up, these shortcomings are few and far between. That Wan shows, say, only an incidental shot of the hanging feet of a past victim instead of a ghastly close-up of the entire corpse is a testament to his restraint, and his growing sophistication, as one of the industry's top purveyors of legitimate and long-lasting scares.<br /><br />The greatest transition that Wan has made since the beginning of his career is one fundamental to the growth of the genre as a whole: moving away from the graphic brutality that was a staple of so much of the past decade's horror movies towards something more emotionally resonant. By \\"emotionally resonant,\\" that doesn't necessarily mean that Wan is attempting to leave long-lasting, deep-rooted emotional damage as a result of scaring his audience. Rather, it refers to his ability to maximize those viewers' willingness to give themselves over to the experience of watching something, caring about characters and story, and coming out feeling as if there was some effect exerted upon their lives other than rank disgust. Although it was certainly effective (and the best in the series), Saw was a showcase for inflicting pain, contextualized as a series of moral dilemmas. This film chronicles the considerably more relatable struggle for one family to achieve the American dream challenged by an otherworldly threat.<br /><br />Of course, Wan's latest isn't the first horror film to explore that idea, or even the first since his Saw days to do so. But The Conjuring is probably the best, certainly in a long time. Thoughtful where its competition is glib, featuring substantive and relatable characters, and steadily-paced where most feel lackadaisical, rushed or uneven, Wan has made a truly great movie.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book expresses the bravery and sacrifice of the men who fought so violently for our country. We should all be grateful for what they went through. It takes the \\"John Wayne\\" glorification out of the war and smacks you in the mouth with the horrifying reality of hell on earth. I'm forever grateful for their service.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|This CD is terrific....I think if I listen to it any more I will wear it out!!!<br /><br />The reason I bought this CD is because I saw her on The Voice last season and heard her do a duet with my favorite guy, Blake Shelton....This rocks....I plan on getting more CDs of Christina's.<br />You will definitely enjoy this one.<br /><br />Marlene
B0091QS88K|1.0|I was playing this game and it kept freezing up constantly after I played it for a few days it kept freezing up.DO NOTget this app
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Lot's of fun and very entertaining. This game is fast paced with a lot of smash up action. Great comical content too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Viewing Season 3 in about one weeks time made me quite anxious for the premiere of Season 4. This show is not about zombies as much as it is about humanity. And the intensity of each scene is fabulous.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|My mom and I laughed often.  Great characterization and choice of actors.  Fun story  I can't wait to see RED2!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show gives a view into the past and how people lived in a different era in England.  Rich and poor are shown in this drama, the choices available to each and what happens if you chose to do something not expected by society.  I really enjoy this show, but I also really enjoy history.  I love shows like this and can never wait for the next episode.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very different styles from my usual reading list but surprisingly refreshing. I found myself relating to Pat, and routing for him throughout the entire book.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I have never truly been a fan of Tom Cruise, but he manages to do a good job in this movie.  He plays an ex-Army police investigator.  Someone has asked for his help to prove his innocent in a crime and Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher goes about his business to do just that.  At first, this movie moves slowly and you almost fall asleep but it gradually wakes you up. In the end he does his job.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Yep now buy the 50 years of bond and you will have a slot to store them all together, watch them every rainy sunday !

0062255657|5.0|Another great novel by Mr. Gaiman.  Never get tired of how he writes his stories and pulls you right in. Loved it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used this application before, use it at Sunday services and our men's group.  Really enjoy the ability to use the speaker to listen to the Word.  My only wish is that I could go to a verse other than just the book and chapter.  I would recommend this application to anyone.
0007466064|5.0|Almost finished with part 1, need to order part 2 asap!I like how this book happens at the same time as book 4. Helps tie everything together.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Great story! It took me no time to finish this book. It is written amazingly well, with tons of details and from a very interesting perspective ;-) I would recommend this book to anybody!

B00BXKKNFS|4.0|I've had this app on my kindle fire for a few days now, and it really works great. I've had no problems and it makes everything so much quicker and easier!
B005COO1X6|4.0|I liked this Steven King book, It held my interest . I didn't like the ending because , you were left with your own ideas of what could have happened to the parents and others.
0786956291|3.0|Decent enough starter kit. Gives you a &#34;walkthrough&#34; of creating your character, but doesn't provide enough in-depth detail as to what all the numbers mean. Just kinda tells you what numbers to put in and where. A little more in depth info on the rules and workings of the game would have been helpful. I suppose it's a decent start though.
B00CDUVDEC|1.0|I was really looking forward to this release, but I was very disappointed. Maybe Phil was trying to create a whole new genre of music, but it failed miserably. I am old enough to remember when Pantera was at their prime and I have the highest regard for Phil as a metal frontman, but this album is awful. The riffs are annoying and all over the place.
1935251740|4.0|I bought this and Peter Ralston's book because of the emphasis on Consciousness.  What caught my attention was a comment that we really may not die, but that consciousness goes on forever and the idea that the universe is created out of consciousness.  I am a Jungian Psychotherrapist and much of this was not news, but I must say that the way he approaches the topic of consiousness was elucidating.  It has started me thinking about Consciousness vs Unconscious is a significant way.  Relative to what I shared above, it really is not all that simple!  But opens the Doors of Perception to a different way.  Gary W. Mac Kendrick
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved the book up until the final pages.  The ending was not what I expected when I imagined several options for the ending going into it.  I did not like how the author finalized the book.
B0091REZMW|4.0|The game has a few glitches, and required items to unlock areas or objects can be hard to obtain. However, it is still lots of fun and helps pass the time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter is 6 and loves this game.  It's great for the both of us to play against each other and still have fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Had ally of fun using!! Thanks<br />I got sucked in the game and many of my friend liked it too.
6304779356|5.0|This is such a cute and funny movie, if you need a good laugh then you need to watch this one it is one movie I can watch over and over.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|If you want non stop reading then this is the book for you. The characters are so captivating that you can just imagine then and feel as if you know them, and talk about action, I should say major action, a real exciting book.  I can't wait for the next book to come out. What Can I say, get this book, you will not be disappointed.
B00008K7AM|5.0|Product was in excellent condition, and is within my favorite movie that I watch over and over, if you need a good laugh then you need to see this movie. ;)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a fun challenging game but one bad thing I want purple minions come on updates first day beat Victor easy
B007HJ96NO|5.0|My Amazon Prime is paying for itself with all these (Free) Prime Movies that I'm getting to watch.  Cinema Paradiso:  Excellent.  World Wide Oscar-Equivalents for this film.  All the other reviews will tell you what the movie is about.  I'm going to give you the best lines of the movie:<br /><br />Everyone has their own destiny.  Get out of here.  This land is cursed.  Living here day after day ... you think it's the center of the world.  You believe nothing will ever change.  Then you leave for a year or two.  When you come back, everything's changed.  The thread's broken.  What you came to find isn't there.  What was yours is gone.  You have to go away for a long time ... many years ... before you come back and find your people.  The land where you were born.  But now, it's not possible.  Right now, you're more blind than I am.<br /><br />Life isn't like it is in the movies.  Life ... is much harder.<br /><br />Get out of here!<br /><br />You're young and the world is yours.<br /><br />And I'm old.<br /><br />I don't want to hear you talk anymore.  I want to hear others talk about you.<br /><br />Don't come back!<br />Don't think about us!<br />Don't look back.  Don't write.<br />Don't give in to nostalgia.<br />Forget us all.<br />If you do and you come back, don't come see me.<br />I won't let you in my house.  Understand?<br /><br />Whatever you end up doing, love it.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Definitely a 4star rating by the 8y/o grandson. He recently saw &#34;2&#34; at a theater and prefers this original version.
B0013WJGJ0|4.0|I enjoyed learning about the background info about how Batman &#34;became&#34; Batman.  How did he learn all his ninja moves!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Very inspirational, and makes one stop and think. Have recommended  this fine book to many friends.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|While films rarely stack up to the books they're made from, this translation was particularly disappointing.<br /><br />Some of the most visual images the book inspired were left out of the film. The therapist leading Pat in an eagle chant--arms raised and hands twisting--generated a camaraderie that made sense of the personal relationship that developed between them.<br /><br />The book's primary theme--a sane person having a heartbreak-catalyzed psychotic break and the comical and sad journey back--was undermined when Pat revealed that he had loved Tiffany the moment they met.<br /><br />That said, there were some bright spots in the film. Tiffany's monologue justifying how Pat's absence from watching Eagles' games improved the team's performance was excellent. Bradley Cooper's depiction of a forlorn, lost soul was believable and far exceeded my epectations.<br /><br />In short, the pivot from heartbreak to lovestruck was too abrupt, as was Cooper's recovery from social ineptitude. Instead of presenting a fresh perspective the film turned this story into a predictable Hollywood love story.
B0064NTZKI|1.0|The 3* reviews have my respect.  If anything, they're too forgiving.  This is a perfect example of deciding to praise a popular figure as his life nears its end and then hunting for things to remember about him.  And anything will do.  Thus, an actress shares her insight that he's not cut from standard cloth, that he's a bit wierd in some respects and then she signs off.  Similar observations abound as other witnesses step forward to offer makeweight platitudes to provide the necessary filler and chew up time.  We're shown his portable typewriter and get a lesson in cutting and pasting without a computer, as W.A. gets out a scissors and stapler and devotes a minute or two to scissoring and stapling (!) with a running explanation, and then the camera lingers over the scissored fragment stapled to the larger paper, as though to dazzle and instruct us in this whizbang technique nobody else could have thought of, but in fact bores us to death.  There are endless variations on feeding us this kind of pablum and I was seized by the odd feeling that the project regards its audience as lobotomized, with geriatric witnesses struggling to compose elementary sentences and everyone certain the complete package will get by through sentimental slopping around.  Allen himself, seat belted in the back of a limo, seems baffled and over his head as he searches for platitudes to offer.  There are a few brief, diverting  TV clips from the 1950s and 1960s, but it's a weary trudge overall, with the flow of tributes crippled by a jet-lag kind of shallowness and a knowing estimate of what the audience came to see and the warm, vacuous glow they will be satisfied with.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I really enjoy playing but there are a few bugs that need to be fixed. Sometimes the game sputters and also stops altogether and I have to reset my kindle.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I intend not just to have the rental for 24 hours, but to have the movie by purchasing it, as the acting is great and the story-line was outstanding.  As the stars called him Hitch, so do I as a big fan of the Great Master of Suspense and Thrillers.  There has never been another like him and never will, as he molds the top stars into characters, I don't believe they thought they could play.  The Master is just that a never ending wonder to the American audience and to every generation after us will come the thrill of seeing the Best of the Best Suspense and Thriller Movies ever shown to any audience, as Alfred Hitchcock will live on forever through his work on films and the audiences that so enjoy his Movies.<br /><br />Sir Anthony Hopkins surely became Hitch, and Helen Miren was his wife Alma.  The only one missing was his devoted daughter and that would of even made the movie more believable for us all to enjoy.  Bravo for the Movie \\"Hitchcock\\".............<br /><br />Here is the Link to a great movie- \\"HITCHCOCK\\" [[ASIN:B00BHU2A7I B00BHU2A7I]]
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|I love the sookie stackhouse books and enjoyed reading the last book. It's nice to have some closure around certain characters and gives warm fuzzies by the end. What will I read now?!?
B0096DZKZC|5.0|this is so cool my friend haylie has this game so I thought I could get it and I did but it takes a while for it to lode I wish it had blaze in it BLAZE IS MY FAVORITE =)

B00000258P|1.0|I ordered this album and it played fine at first, but now it won't play. I don't want a refund but I would like a replacement album that plays properly. Welty Davies at weltysdavies@hotmail.com.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the movie and now I love the game! The minions are so cute. I definitely would recommend this game. Great game for all ages.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love games  and the game is so COOL I love I love it so much can I be the firs to say I love this game a nd no internet has to be included in the game so watcha waitin for  download the game now
B004XMMSZG|5.0|Just received it and it works with both my devices. I'll write here what they are so folks can find the info online.<br /><br />1. Connects with a Yamaha YDS-12 dock, used with a [[ASIN:B004E10JZW Yamaha YSP2200 132-Watts RMS-Wireless 7.1 Digital Sound Projector(Black)]] sound bar system. This setup worked great with my iPhone, now thanks to this little Bluetooth dockBoss gizmo, it works great with a Galaxy S4 phone. Note: the YDS-12 dock has a slide setting button on the back that flipped between compatibility with older vs. newer iPhones/iPods (where the iPhones, old and new, all stated that they were incompatible with the dock, but they still worked). One of the settings of this slide button doesn't work with the dockBoss Bluetooth device - so flip the button if it doesn't work and it will.<br /><br />2. Connects with a Logitech Pure-fi Anywhere portable player. We take this one camping and its got a good battery, so we're happy.<br /><br />Small note: you'll have to re-connect to the Bluetooth device each time after disconnection. There are Android apps that can be set to connect automatically. Also, one user's note here in the reviews was useful: device code is 0000.<br /><br />And with the hissing: in my case, with the source (the Android phone) volume high, the hissing is gone - so I control most volume range from the music amplifier unit. My guess is that there would be cases where it can be the other way around - source volume medium-low and the amplifier unit higher. It all depends on the frequency filters that each device in the chain has implemented. Play with it and it'll work right.<br /><br />Have fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So many details of the early 1900's English era brought to life in this dramatic series.  From the setting to the characters and back again, the show is rich in its delivery on quality entertainment.  The issues the Crawley's 'endure' are a true reflection of the era and their position in society.  The servants lives are as interesting, if not more, and the interconnectedness of it all creates an amazing story.
B00AHDXTIK|5.0|So awesome so so awesome!!!! Well build quality. Cable is very strong and very tough. 3m long, wow nice now I can listen to my podcast from the second row of my car.
B00004YTZE|5.0|If you like punk music and do not own this album, then you need to buy two!! ;)  This is classic style raw punk rock.  Not pretty or friendly but wild, reckless and fun.  It is a bastard of an album and will kick you in the cajones.  Every single song is raw and real.  If you get this remix version, it is a little more cleaned up than some of the older versions but the songs still sound raw and great.  just to be simple, YOU LIKE PUNK, BUY THIS ALBUM, you will thank yourself later.
0425252868|5.0|Great book, could not put it down. True story of German pilot caught up in second world war. Human side of a fighter pilot, his thoughs and feeling.
B007L6VR6M|3.0|I'm a big fan of &#34;RUSHMORE&#34; and maybe that's where the problem is.  I had seen the trailer for this movie, and I had hoped it was going to be a similar type story, but it's not.  The art direction, camera moves and acting are good, but if the story with its &#34;A&#34; level cast is asked to do things opposite their character type in a rather lack luster story line, then you've got a rather ho-hum movie.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys are back with a wonderful new album called \\"Electric\\" that is fresh, vibrant, & great fun! As the album title suggests, \\"Electric\\" contains 9 high-energy, electro-pop songs- there are NO ballads to be found here! This latest offering from the Pet Shop Boys marks both a refreshing return to form for the duo and a welcome return to dance orientated pop music.<br /><br />For their latest album \\"Electric\\", the Pet Shop Boys wisely joined forces with Super Producer Stuart Price- Price produced Madonna's \\"Confessions On A Dance Floor\\" & Kylie Minogue's \\"Aphrodite\\" albums. Stuart Price helped the Pet Shop Boys to produce a very current sounding album, & yet it allows the Duo to still retain their own identity.<br /><br />\\"Electric\\" certainly puts to rest any doubts that the Pet Shop Boys may have lost their special magic & pop sensibilities- this is in stark contrast to their previous album \\"Elysium\\"(2012); that turned out to be a somewhat depressing, down-tempo & lacklustre affair.<br /><br />The first single \\"Axis\\" initially had me a little concerned because it had very few vocals & instead it was mostly an instrumental track, I was happy to discover that the lead single is not representative of the rest of the album at all! The other songs on the \\"Electric\\" album have plenty of Catchy Vocals to Enjoy.<br /><br />It's difficult to pick favourite songs from this album because I honestly enjoy them all- even \\"Axis\\" works in the overall context of the album because it's the first song and it serves as a `prologue' of sorts to the rest of the album. Three songs that are standouts are \\"Bolshy\\", \\"Thursday\\" (featuring Example), and \\"Vocal\\".<br /><br />Pet Shop Boy's \\"Electric\\" is a Strong and Consistent Album. It's certainly their best album in years! I thoroughly recommend that you buy this album- Enjoy!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Everyone should see this series. If you saw the movie about what really happened when Osama was killed there are a lot of similarities to heroine of this series
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a must read. Couldn't put it down and loved the whole entire series. The author draws you in to feel like you are watch the whole book unfold before your very eyes!
141694740X|4.0|A friend lent me this book, after we saw the movie, together.<br /><br />Initially, I didn't expect to get much out of it. I mean, I'm recently divorced after 10+ years of marriage, and I'm not looking to get into another relationship, just yet. So, the lessons inside wouldn't really apply. How mistaken was I.<br /><br />The examples posed and the answers given shed an awful lot on my marriage. No wonder I felt unloved! He just wasn't that into me!<br /><br />It's freeing in a way. There was never anything I could've done to change things.
0385751532|5.0|It took a bit to realize his pronouncement of the words but then once to did it makes the book more poignant.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|fun. exciting. funny. hard. entertaining. classic. simple. fast. This is my FAVORITE game on my kindle. best of all,  It's FREE!
B000RZIGVS|5.0|This is one of my favorite Star Trek series to watch.  I enjoyed it while it was on TV and I'm really enjoying it now that it's on CD.  I have my favorite shows and now I can watch them whenever I want to. Thank you for the memories.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I have ben waiting for it to come out on kindle for over a year. I love this game and it is my favourite tower defense game. As soon as I saw it in the store I didn't waste any time buying it. If you think that costs too much remember that it is $2.99 for the iPod touch/phone and $4.99 for iPad.<br /><br />Added: After I posted the review above I looked at reviews by other's. I always go lowest to and was surprised at the number of low reviews. The one that surprised me the most was about the sudden jump in difficulty. That is totally false. I have beaten this game on harden difficulty and never had to turn down the difficulty. Right now I am working on the challenge modes and having no problem. Some of you might think that I purchased in app items to make it easier but I haven't. I only bought one hero and that was by accident after I beat the main story. Another complaint that I saw was that it doesn't work on the non HD versions of the kindle. That is false. I have a Kindle fire and it works perfectly fine. Have no fear about buying this app. It is fun and easy if you know what you are doing. I hope you enjoy as much as I do.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|like the game its not to difficult to solve the puzzles.  Great game for any age if you like puzzle games.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|AND I LOVE IT. i like to write minature stories or imagines for my friends and this helps me jot down ideas! this is such an amazing,and free product! I definitely reccomend this lovely app!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|So how are we suppose to get the updated Facebook app for the kindle? Since the kindle and Google  store are not compatible? Facebook tells me to install the new app but I can't?
B00AFROVQC|2.0|It's a pretty good story line and the series as a whole is quite good, but each individual book falls short. There is only an overriding arc to this series, and each book should have its own smaller story arc with resolution. These books do not offer this. It feels more like reading chapters of one book than reading 6 different books. The books do not leave the reader with a comfortable resolution that leaves them satiated while waiting for the next book. instead you are compelled to find the next book and read it because there is no comfortable end point. good for the writer but not good for the reader, really.
B00756GRUE|5.0|Could not have been more satisfied with price, quality, and plenty of compliments. The stares at the timepiece are obvious.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Is this the end of Sookie? I hope not, but understand if it is.  This has been a great series to read, and I have truly loved every moment of it! I also watch the TV series, and must say that the series started off pretty close to the books, but has branched off in its own direction, so have enjoyed both! Kudos to Charlaine Harris for a wonderful cast of characters! Brilliant!
B000001GPX|3.0|Requires a very quiet room as some of it is barely audible.<br />I would not purchase this again. Dot dot.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Needed it for my pokewalker, worked perfectly, came quickly, and was a great price. I wish all batteries were this cheap
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is an awesome game. I really like this game a lot. People should start playing this game .It is a great game.
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|The Trio of Keith Jarrett, Jack DeJohnette and Gary Peacock is now over thirty years running, and as the years have passed by, the playing reached new heights at every turn and is now at the pinnacle of inventiveness. I own everything Jarrett and the Trio have put out and 'Somewhere' is a new revelation of acoustic jazz. The opening 'Solar' with the prelude of &#34;Deep Space&#34;, is like a jigsaw puzzle trying to pull itself together and is somewhat confusing and dazzling at first, but when you listen to the following performances it makes total sense, for there is a bouyant, vibrant rhythm and bounce to the Trio on this occasion in July 2009. This is how Jazz is meant to be heard in the 21st Century and not some 'ding dong song and dance' we have all heard a thousand times before. 'Somewhere' is of course from 'West Side Story' and it's melody is strong and seductive as it lingers in the head for days, even weeks after. This piece develops in to a funkier 'Everywhere' and the bass notes on the piano are strong and gospel tinged, and make you want to dance. Jarrett is in great form here, digging up pearls and mining for gold in the notes he produces. I have seen the Trio four times in the last decade and I would have loved to have been present at this particular gig as there is an electricity running through the three musicians during the creation of such high art. Jack DeJohnette's percussion is playful but masterful and he holds the music in place with deft precision. The ballads are sparse and warm and Gary Peacock's timbre is pronounced, deep and a joy to listen to. If you have forgotten how beautiful a double bass can sound, just listen to him play. The album finishes with the gentle 'I thought About You' and by this time we all have a smile on our faces. The musicians for producing the music and the listeners for getting such a great gift. I guess you could say I recommend this recording. I do.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|There are just as many 007 as different Superman movies. I just was bored out of my mind, was trying to get through this movie. I basically hate it
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great show!!  Julianna Margulies is AWESOME!!! .....and the cast is great!! I won't be missing an episode. Can't wait til the next season is available on Prime!!
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I watch PI because I went by word of mouth, this movie sucks, a lot of money spent on beautiful background. Some Awwww moments, one sad moment. But overall, I just wanted the movie to end, I felt like I was watching a poor rip off remake of Big Fish. And I love The movie Big Fish.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|Twilight is by far my favorite movie,, so glad to be able to watch it anytime now from my Amazon library.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Ok, if you can get through the soft porn. LOL! And the crazy murder scenes then is and will be an HBO classic, maybe even a big blockbuster movie, (with sequels). I couldn't eat, shower, or sleep without worrying about what would happen next, there are several stories going at once which can get confusing. The Sex is a bit much, I was hot and bothered which was getting on my last nerves ( I suggest skipping to the story or action). Beautiful Colors, set up and design in the movies series, you can tell money was no expense. Please watch, and well worth buying.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|The Twilight Sagas are by far my favorite movies,, so glad to be able to watch it anytime now from my Amazon library.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|It was a good movie, a Glee/Bring it on type movie. I like and don't like movies like these, you can always know that the underdog team, class, talent, dancers, cheerleaders, and music group will pull it together, and pull a wow performance at the end. Funny movies, kinda a same o, same o.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Not a challenge but it was good game to pass time.easy mind game if you want something quick to do
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I could careless about the suppose Blacks using the N----- word to feel self empowered. If you want respect, then respect yourself by not doing what you feel is a slander word from another culture (whites). I still and would probably never see a movie where whites empower themselves, by over using the word Cracker or Hornky and their aka don't even sound as bad as the N word.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Quartet is the kind of movie you want to see more than once - most enjoyable and  Maggie Smith was outstanding -= lots of stars in the movie - watch carefully and you will recognize many
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|this was awesome! I can'twait for it to continue. the character development, story line kept me reading and wanting more.
B008Y76VW2|4.0|This is a cool throw back movie,  reminding me of when I was first falling in love and having sex, and Kristen Stewart is amazingly easy to fall for.
B005R32L66|5.0|Skype is the best thing since sliced bread for keeping in contact with friends and relatives 10,000 miles away.  For the most part it offers great quality for sound and video.  Easy to operate
B008Y768XO|5.0|It's just a very well done movie.  You can't help but fall in love with Hachi!  And based on a true story ......sort of!
B005HSL626|5.0|Very exciting, competetive. I'm constantlt trying to beat the pass score. I play with my family and we have a great time with this game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton is an excellent series, very captivating.  We can't wait until Season 4 as the end of Season 3 is a cliff hanger!
0670026557|5.0|I acquired these books for University of Michigan Book Awards for high school students.  Reading this book gave me a whole new perspective on success and achievement.  Well written and thought provoking.  Recommended reading.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Used to love the death outta this app. Then the updates added all kinds of clutter. I like having the local weather forecast... I hate seeing the national news. Why must I be bombarded with things other then the local forecast. A way to disable extra tabs would be nice.<br />But the last straw was adding clutter to my notifications bar. No way to remove it. No settings to hide it. Sorry... I'm not using it anymore.<br />3 stars for accurate weather, though.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This works great on Android and I use it all the time.  A great selection of books and reading is a delight with Kindle.  I highly recommend it for Android devices.
B009NY43NY|3.0|It was no shocker that the final book was disappointing. The last two or three books really felt bland. It seemed like Harris got bored with this world she had created
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Enjoyed this movie with our 4 year-old son.  Funny and age appropriate. The minions really steal the show. Fully recommended...
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Very fast delivery! The box was a little bigger than I expected but it had the bubble wrap inside so nothing happened to the movies which I will take a little bulk for a safely delivered movie. Ordered it for my kids 5th birthday! He is going to love it.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This is by far the best show on TV and even better than the 1st season!!! I highly recommend it!
B0093ST02E|3.0|I am not sure about this movie.  Not everyone will like it I think.  Different.  It was saying a lot without saying much.  The acting was good however.
B005LAIHEA|5.0|Great cast. Very sweet romantic comedy. Loved all the characters and made me love Emily Blunt even more!  Perfect movie to relax and laugh to.
B008KW43TE|3.0|I didnt get the download from amazon to my personnel collection of music or on my own hardddrive or pc so i have no clue were my whole cd that i paid for is which is stupid because downloading should be a chore it  should be easy when you by music of line
1451673442|5.0|I found a copy at a store and loved it so much I ordered one for a friend.  If you dont mind meditation, journaling etc and want to see some changes in your life its a must buy and keep.
B004S699HC|1.0|The movie was horrible just a bad movie that shouldn't have been made or even thought of being after the first crow.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Eva and Gideon's drama continues and so does their love story. I was a bit sad that it ended where it did, but I'm already looking forward to the next book. Too bad we will probably have to wait so long!
B005EY2XFC|5.0|Brandon lee last movie that he was killed in with real bullet in stead of a dummy load but still has good story .RIP Brandon Lee
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game is played by my 8 year old and this is her review: I love playing this game, it's lots of fun. I like interacting with the dragons to make them hatch and grow. However, I purchased gold bars and never received them (I was charged, but no gold bars showed up in the game). I contacted the app's customer service and no one will respond. If I got the gold bars I paid for, this would be a 5 star game. But taking money and not giving the product, and then not responding to an inquiry is NOT okay.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I knew when I got to this book it wouldn't fail me because of how good the first and second one were. I didn't know they could get any better but they did and definitely didn't disappoint. It kept me reading until the very end.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|We read this for our book club.  I had not read anything by this author before but found book well written
B009VB9VKY|3.0|I was forced to watch this. Coming from a Male a straight man.. The movie is awful. the ending is terrible. the sister is overprotective
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I enjoy somewhat of a challange.  I want something I can do, but I want it to challange me.  This does it.  You can find some of the numbers and have to look for some, then you have to look really hard for a few.  At the end you have to search for one or two, curse and hit the hint button because there is that one number you just can't find.  Then you fuss because you still can't see it, you didn't get the time you wanted and you do it again.  I love this one and do it more than once.  This is a keeper to put in the cloud and pull it out again to start over later.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|I like this movie, lots of actions, guns, drugs. what more could you ask for  I rate this movie a 5 out of 5
B005P1YCNK|3.0|Found the book to be almost word for word Darren's public presentation and quite a pitch for subscribing to his magazine.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|As Grandparents, were pleasantly surprised at the quality entertainment of this film. Grandson kept hinting at this movie, so we jumped in..he also suggested Amazon Prime for which we are happy that we subscribed.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Game is great and so replayable. Up to now, no issues, just a great game, very addictive! ! Now... I tried to update the fifteen bonus rounds and now its telling me I can't, because of either an order is pending (not possible, I checked. The correct, operating system... not that either! ) I want to play it bad... need some help, ASAP.<br />txsweetater
1932735410|5.0|I took the PMP exam yesterday and passed thanks in large part to this book.  I took a class that spanned a few months and led up to a 4 day boot camp, so it wasn't my only study source.  I can't say I would recommend it as a single source for studying, but the test questions at the end of each chapter were the closest thing to the test that I saw during my studying.  I highly recommend it for supplemental study.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is very good it's better than jaws this 1 is you can eat people other sharks chose other sharks like reef shark mako shark tiger shark great white shark an this mysterious awesome shark get it now it's the best get it nnnnnnnnnnoooooooooowwwwww!
B009NQZVKG|4.0|James Rollins is one of my favorite authors. I've read all of his books and have never been disappointed. waiting for next one patiently
B009UX2YAC|3.0|A pretty good game overrall but it's difficult to earn money or items like the Eifel Tower things to complete the weekly challenges.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My sextuplets- 3 ( Remady  Dafeney  Bay  -girls Braxton  Kanye  James -boys ) twins - 10 Leah Alice and  other pair of twins  lilly  and Dylen are the loves of my life
B005C0DHIK|4.0|Greed outweighs responsible behavior as shown by this documentary.  We have problems in this country, serious problems, and most can be attributed to greed.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|kanye has definitely went down since his 2007 album, haven't really liked him since. He needs to step his game up.
B004LROMWU|3.0|Maybe it's the way the characters selfishly pursue their own interests to detriment of their military unit (the little pri** professor disagrees with his superior officer, so he orchestrates a coup with his kids). Maybe it's because this story is set in Boston, which Falling Skies portrays as a town full of arrogant people, like university professors & doctors (and so it doesn't tend to create the most sympathetic victim population). Maybe it's the way Falling Skies has turned college professors into military leaders (again, it's an unrealistic oil and water combination fantasy--which doesn't mix). Or maybe it's because of the way in which Steven Spielberg got lazy and recycled a lot of his War of The Worlds ideas. Whatever the reason, I am rooting for the aliens to win...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good works well you feel like you are working with a horse. it seems real and it is nice and fun to play
B004QX07G4|2.0|Sorry, Ellen...I love you, but this book was actually boring! We bought the eBook so there wasnt a hassle with it getting delivered, but I wish we hadnt bought it at all.
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Chis Nolan brings the dark, yet awesome flavor of the Dark Knight to the Superman scene. Man of Steel presents Superman in a completely new way that makes him seem less invincible or god-like and more plausible and now-to-earth (no pun intended)in the most gratifying way. This new Superman film is the one to see, bringing out his alien side while still making him the most \\"human\\" superman yet.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|The sword play is so effective I wish I found this sooner<br /><br />The games action is so amazing I can't put it down
B00DYEN6XC|4.0|Can any one tells me if these dvd have behind the scene, deleted scenes, director cuts etc? because it if they are selling just the movie alone then i rather wait until they come out with some more of these good stuff...
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I will be recommending this to my Book Club when we meet after the summer break.  I will be looking up the meanings again and again!
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Good game. The segments could be a Little longer. I don  like that they are trying to get my money in order for me to succeed but that's gaming for you
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I love this movie because there is nothing but positiveness! Looking at it now, after all these years, I had forgotten what a superb movie this is. I saw the imaginary trips in a new way too. There's a lot of magic in this movie and I love magic. I am a big fan of guided imagery and got some incredible ideas. Julie Andrews still had her fabulous voice at that time. She is such a joy to be entertained by. It was a positive experience. I will come back and visit again.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I love the actors in this movie! They work great together and are fun to watch. The movie is full of fun humor. I have watched this movie many times and will watch it many more times!!! Great romantic comedy!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|this is definitely very funny movie.as these action heroes grew older they have become very comical.whoever wrote the script had very good sense of humor.
B00C7JG0KG|2.0|All the hubbub over Disney NOT including a regular blu-ray with the 3D blu-ray is pointless with this particular movie.  It's just not that good.  I got the blu-ray from Netflix and it was only OK.  I doubt that 3D would have made it a better movie.  A better script and better acting would have done that.
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|A new FAVORITE children's book!<br />So CUTE!<br />So AMAZING!<br />So WONDERFUL!<br />So NEED TO READ!<br /><br />Duncan just wants to color...<br />But when he opens the crayon box they have some news for him!<br /><br />CUTE CUTE ending as Duncan finds a way to handle 'the day the crayons quit.'
B004BC7MRM|5.0|This album is great :)  I really liked the ease of downloading and uploading into my itunes.  Very high audio quality.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|after seeing the show I thought I would give the books a try.  Started off great but after book three it starts being more of a chore to read.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|My husband and I recently got free tickets to see the sequel to this movie before it is released to the public.  I was excited until I realized that I had never seen the whole movie in its entirety all at once.  Looking at my netflix and direct tv on demand, it was not available so I signed up for Amazon Prime just to rent this.  I LOVED THIS EXPERIENCE.  Paid $2.99 and got to watch it instantly - no buffering, no need to wait while it downloads in full.  Fast forward and rewind worked extremely well also.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|after seeing the show I thought I would give the books a try.  Started off great but after book three it starts being more of a chore to read.
B005PK1G76|4.0|Ordered this to go with my Baby Jogger Summit XC.  Works well.  Holds 2 drinks, room in the middle for my phone, keys, boogie wipes or whatever, and there's a little outer pocket for garage door opener to fit on.  Does the job.
B009NY43NY|5.0|couldn't put down until finished. from the moment I started,  I stayed up late trying to get it all done in one day.
0316789798|5.0|I remember this from my childhood.  Still draw cats the way Ed taught me! A little hard for my 5-year-old to attend to concentration-wise but he's going to enjoy it over the next several years I know.
B000UUF69A|2.0|too dark and too serious, this should have been fun and funny all the way...needed more &#34;cowabunga&#34; and less &#34;lord of the rings.&#34; I wouldn't recommend this for kids under 9 years old.
B006VJMZXY|5.0|Great book, excellent visual through good writing and descriptions.  Ties well into other books around the same era.  Worth a read
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|At first the main character seemed like he might be bad actor, but after the first few minutes I actually got really into the movie. I really liked it. I'm not sure if I'm crazy about the ending, but I would see this movie again. Female main actress was good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is AWESOME! Anyone who says this game is bad is out of there mind crazy! anyway this game is just super fun you just gotta get it its super fun get it!
B00B2PHSIY|3.0|This filter is nice in concept. It fits great and it does bring a lot of the color back in below 10ft, however,as others have stated there is the problem of these droplets that get stuck between the filter and the lens. I always made sure that the filter and the lens was dry and i still have these bubble spots that distort part of your images/video. I used this for my 3 day great barrier reef dives and i'm still happy i did although i saw video from someone who used the film that actually goes inside the case in front of the actual camera lens and he got the same depth of color (not all blued/greened out like without the filter) except he didnt have the spots. My recommendation is get the film that goes inside the case. There are some for sale on here for like 30$ and that is ridiculous as is the price for this little piece of plastic. Go find something in a hobby shop and cut it to fit inside the case.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am truly loving this series!!! I feel that I am part of the lives of Eva and Gideon! Definitely better than the &#34;Shades&#34; series!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Better than advertised.  This stylus is very functional and does all that I expected, plus it has two additional tips for when one wears out.  A good purchase.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great u can turn into a giant, freeze thing's, pony rides and minion shield its the best game ever I just can't stop playing it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's works.  Easy peasy.  Couldn't ask for any more.  Thanks for developing the quintessential standard function calculator for the Kindle.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is easy but can get confusing at times. This game is an easy puzzle game for people who like me are into puzzle games but just don't like them complicated. I rate this a five star game.
0345529057|5.0|I love the show and the books are even better. This brand new boxed set was much cheaper than other places.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although depressing, this book also gave me hope and a look at the reality of cancer and dying, and what matters most in this life.
B00CRS5HII|4.0|I am really blown away by the way his singing has evolved over the years. Some singers change and never sound as good as they did, Darius sounds better. Absolutely love Wagon Wheel. Danced to it with my son at my grandson's wedding! Now that's saying something!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game and great for the kids too! Lots of fun stuff to collect and completing the missions is what makes the game for me:)
B00821OX98|4.0|I'm hooked on this one.  After the first episode, we spent the next 2 days catching up to season 3... only to find it worth paying for to continue to current!  Fun, provocative and packed with metaphoric political innuendos.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book. I liked how throughout the book that the author changed the perspectives to different characters then in the end it looped back around to August. I liked how she added humor and that the book was in first person. I think if you were the type of person who likes more personal books instead of like fantasy wasn't your favorite ... then I would definitely recommend this book.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|These books are very interesting and no bad language to have to deal with. It is a series that I hope to read all of the books
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great app! I spend hours on it PER day! One glitch is when you click on a pin, it won't show you the bottom little bit... kind of annoying. It would be an amazing app is that fixed that one thing next update:)
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|have this on my pc. hoping it's as good on my fire. downloading right now. thanks for making it available! !
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|This game is fun that's why I gave a 4 but it takes forever to unroll the monkey and shoots wrong
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This game is very awesome! There are very difficult  levels along the way.  I an  all.of my friends LOVE this app. I would HAVE to rate the stars a big number 5!
B004YESKU0|5.0|Great compact box set, all 5 S.O.A.D Albums in one box. Every album has its own thin cover and booklet.
B00004YB9Y|5.0|These three tenors are great indivdualy - but togetherr they are magnificent.<br />It also makes a very nice Cristmas prsent for anyone
B00C061I3K|4.0|OK but the music is a bit redundant. and the voice over is really annoying.  Otherwise some decent grooves on the cd
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I originally purchased these headphones for binaural beats meditation and then decided to see what music sounds like in them and WOW, they put my more expensive pair of ear buds to shame! I am in love with the sound, this is a total bargain!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|As others have said this won't take weeks to play but it is a well designed, stable, and most importantly fun.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|This one is one of the most underrated Star Trek movies in the series. Great plot, action, moves along quickly
B001VQF9K8|4.0|Pros<br />Quality materials and workmanship<br />Narrow at thigh keeps it in correct place<br />Easy wash<br />Drys quick<br /><br />Con<br />A bit big in the butt<br /><br />I would buy it again.
B002U3CCF6|3.0|Not as assured or as witty as &#34;Gone Girl&#34; Too gruesome for my taste and it was hard to relate to a central character with so many issues. In fact the whole town was disturbed!
B002M87V0A|5.0|The Music Man has catchy songs and clean humor the whole family can watch.  It even has an \\"always tell the truth\\" moral, so I can feel good about the time my kids spend rotting their brain! :P
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These performers are astounding, amazing, and extremely talented.  I am definitely a fan!  They are from my small town of St. George, UT, but are becoming world-renowned.  Way to go guys!!
B00338QENI|5.0|Everyone should read this book to recognize what an important role Henrietta has played in science. Not only science but to each individual that has ever been immunized to prevent future diseases.  Her name should be a common household name. There should be a statue of her in every educational hospital throughout the word.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This was just a wonderful story about the healing power a garden can have on the soul. This little garden touches, transforms, heals and positively affects the lives of the characters in a beautiful way. It weaves a tapestry of the sweet, beautiful journeys of damaged human hearts emerging from dark, bleak places into the space where joy and appreciation blooms as they witness the rejuvenation and rebirth of a once neglected and dying garden into a thriving place of beauty and life.  There is rich symbolism and food for thought in this gem of a story.  A real treasure that I will pass on to others many times over. There is a \\"fragrance\\" that lingers after the story is done... insight emerging into your thoughts much like a sprig of new growth sprouting from the earth. And the story lives on...
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the game a lot but to get keys and mystery boxes is very rare now.however I like the way it changes the place,but I kinda wish they would do some more made in America ones.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Well acted, beautifully light. Gracefully crafted.  I wish I would have seen in theatre but glad I found this tonight. Positive thoughts.  I will watch again and maybe he will to.
B00004WG2F|3.0|I do not have a printer to print out the return label but received legend of the fist instead.  never opened it
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Found this book to be easy to follow and hard to put down. Thought it to be a good choice.  Will read another with the character Will Robie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really cool a must play for all ages!! I had a lot of fun trying to figure it out with my daughter.
0375969020|5.0|This book is the summer reading requirement for my sons entire middle school, including all faculty. I decided to read it myself and I'm very glad I did. It really gives you a look at how someone's appearance can affect everyone. A lot of times in society we broadly label someone as having &#34;special needs&#34; when in reality some people have no special needs, they just look different or act a little different, but otherwise they are perfectly normal, healthy people. We need to teach our children that we are all human regardless of how we look and that we all deserve to be treated as equals.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I went to the theater with very high expectations for this film and I was not disappointed.  This brought me back to my childhood during the 1970's and 1980's watching any Godzilla movie on channel 38, which was a Providence R.I. station at the time.  I could always count on the \\"Creature Double Feature\\" to show some type of giant monster destroying something.  Flash forward to present day and here comes this gem \\"Pacific Rim\\" in theaters.  This movie is everything a good sci-fi monster movie is-fun!  Great special effects, good story line, good acting, and the directing is excellent.  All the nay sayers and haters don't know what they are talking about and they maybe thought they were going to see a \\"drama\\" or \\"love story\\" or any chic flick.  Maybe they didn't grasp the previews when they showed the giant monster destroying something?  Yes I could understand how that would throw someone off.  Yes my first thought was, \\"my wife would love this dramatic telling of a love struck alien monster\\".  My gauge for knowing a movie was very good is how fast the two hours go by.  During this movie I felt like I was only sitting there for 30 minutes.  I can't wait to get the 3D version on blu ray.
B0050XFY4O|5.0|From Beginning to End is an emotional family story centering on the unconventional relationship between two brothers growing up in upper middle class Brazil. This film travels into controversial territory, forcing the audience to release judgment and preconceptions. Beautifully crafted and well acted, the director and cast do a masterful job given the limited budget of a small independent production. I highly recommend this film to anyone willing to travel into uncharted territory of the heart.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This is one the great movies of all times, perfect for the begining of the hole series the acting the effect, Christian Bale is the best Batman.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|its a good four star with special effects  and is little gory and lots of action well put together. these giants are old and mean looking, were is there women .
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Not many words needed. Great and breathtaking as always, up to the last page. Can't wait for the next novel.
B0091THRCU|5.0|Snugg is snug and the elastic release feature is totally cool.  For those like me who hate the locked-on surrounding iPhone protectors, but want their iPhone safe while not in use will love this product.  Good design.  High quality.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book, once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait for the movie this fall!!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I enjoy the story lines, the plot development, and the cast seems perfect for the characters they portray.  Looking forward to when season 3 goes &#34;Prime&#34;.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|my wife likes it and so do I. hope you will enjoy it like we both do. just enjoy it
0399255370|5.0|Love this children's story and will use this story as a entering text for writing personification narratives from the crayon's pov.  Good story for teaching mood words as well.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|World War Z is a zombie apocalypse story. The zombies are the typical, shambling Romero variety. You get bit, you die, you come back a rotting corpse - nothing new here (except maybe the fact that these zombies can function underwater). The book itself is anecdotal, told after the War is long over. The accounts of the zombie invasion span the entire globe (and even beyond in one chapter) and start with the first discovery of the disease in China.<br /><br />Max Brooks does a good job paying attention to and including details and I believe that is one place where the story succeeds. There is a lot of interesting technical and military jargon throughout the accounts, existing and fictional, all defined in the appendix. Each individual tale in the book is well thought out and they all tie into each other using references from previous chapters. Some of the sections of the book were engrossing and did create some emotional connection and dramatic tension.<br /><br />Overall, I found that the story read almost like a magazine article or report depicting any previous event. Other reviews have discussed the lack of attachment to any main character(s) and I tend to agree with this assessment. There is nothing new in the context of this book, it's just a rehashed account of any other zombie story. The only reason I was able to get through WWZ is because it is quite easy to read and the delivery is innovative. I'm not a huge fan of zombie/horror stories, add +1 star if you are
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book thoroughly. I also got inspired by this as an author. In this digital publishing age, an author has to think about marketing as much as he thinks about writing and I certainly felt inspired as an author after reading this one. More often than not, authors closely guard their strategies and it is nice to see John explain this thought process and strategy in this book.
B0055S348W|5.0|Easy to download & install.  I emailed Amazon concerning what I could do for a printer. They responded quickly and recommended this app.
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you're a fan of the Christopher Nolan trilogy then this is a must have for you.  I love that I'm able to sit down and have a Batman marathon or pick the movie I'm in the mood for and watch it along with the special features.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game will keep you going.  I love it as well as my kids.  They cannot keep devices out of their hands trying to play it.  I like the original temple run but 2 is a little better.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I loved the episodes Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead.  Alex Kingston was and is amazing in her role as River Song.  Steven Moffat really did a great job creating the character River Song and casting Alex Kingston.  These were the two episodes that really got me into Doctor Who.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I truly enjoyed this game. There were some points that made you stop and think of how am I going to do this next part. Lots of fun and would play it over and over again. I just wish there were more chapters to it because it ended way to soon.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I love this movie and this was the perfect addition for my collection.  I'm so glad I got it on Blu-ray so now I can watch it as many times as I want.  The story is amazing and the soundtrack is wonderful.  Julie Andrews absolutely shines in this movie.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Probably one of the best TV series I have ever viewed. I like it more on DVD when I can see all seasons together as i cannot always watch it on TV.
B0044RFT8S|5.0|The movie that started it all.  That gave us the psychotic penguins and King Julian the thirteenth self proclaimed king of the lemurs.  This movie is awesome and still cracks me up everything I watch it.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Can't stop watching this show.  Never viewed it on TV. Really got held my attention. Can't stop watching this series.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I loved this movie so much.  Josh Brolin was perfectly cast as a young agent K.  I loved the storyline and have watched this movie multiple times since I bought it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games. Have played many apps this is my favorite by far.  So many rooms and so many objects without having to switch out games. Have not had to purchase anything. Would recommend.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I love the original game for arcade machines and even the super Nintendo versions but the version really just wasn't that good in my opinion.  Won't be playing it again.
B000K4X5XA|2.0|Not sure if my experience was a fluke, but I could not get this blu-ray disc to play in my PS3. I've never had issues playing blu-rays before. It may have been a one-off bad disc, but my rating must reflect the experience I had.<br /><br />The movie itself is fantastic. The product I received, however, was not.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I love this movie.  It is one of my all time favorites.  I'm so happy to have it on DVD now and with the added bonus features.  So glad I finally bought this!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was a great app. Now The Weather Channel app sucks. They  took a great app and made it non-user friendly. And ruined it by adding cheap dollar store calendar photos. You are better off downloading the WeatherBug app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is pretty handy and so easy to use. I recommend this to every Kindle owner (who loves computing like me).
B0097C8XL0|5.0|If you like subway surfers and/or temple run, you'll love this game. Its penguin themed and it has its own mechanics compared to the other games I mentioned
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I'm in obscenity this book. I would suggest this book to anatomical loves fantasy story. 5 star book and its romantic too.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This was a great app prior to the current update.  It was simple, straight forward, and easy to use.  After the update the radar map never works properly and I can't do a simple thing like go easily back and forth from the current to the hourly forecast.  Also, the pictures are nice as the back ground for the current forecast, however, don't put up a picture with clouds, for example, and then use white lettering for the current conditions.  You can't even read the forecast!  Last thing is the achievements that can be unlocked - if I wanted to play a game, I would.  I just want to check the weather with no fuss.  Uninstalled.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|When I grow up I want to be a potato that can work at a chip factory to make my dreams come true
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great read and lots of fun to share with the entire family and friends. Wish I didn't have to do
B009C7JS14|5.0|this really helped my dads weatherbug app wasn't working so I had to get this and it helped me too I don't have to ask my dad
0446563048|5.0|Highly recommend for anyone who manages people, runs a business, or who is entrepreneurial-minded. I found the success story of Tony Hsieh to be entertaining, interesting, and inspiring.
1608871827|5.0|It's rare that a cinema art book meets my expectations. Even rarer that it exceeds them, like this volume did. It's a wonderful layout and the concept art pieces are very well chosen, but the artifactual \\"pull-out extras\\" strewn throughout the book really sealed the deal - from full size recruitment posters to the adhesive kaiju kill marks to illustrative pages from Del Toro's note book and more. My first leaf through the book felt like a treasure hunt, with the ultimate reward being the sealed poster envelope on the back flap.<br /><br />Meanwhile the text delivers both meaningful production perspectives as well as doling out some great story background and detail that just couldn't be covered in the film without turning into an exposition fest. We get details on the creatures, characters, and hardware that both appear in the film or are implied by the story. This volume has it all, whether you're a devotee of the mecha/kaiju genres or just a lover of imaginative cinema production. It's one of the best books of its type I've ever seen.
B009CPJHY4|3.0|Not awful, but not great. With a cast of lesser actors, this would have been a disaster but individual performances made some moments worthwhile. I will not watch it again.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I love it because I always need to know who is singing that song on the radio or on tv
B0090SI4LU|2.0|I have to say that the movie did not do justice to the book. Without a doubt, do not let the movie deter you from reading what is actually an engaging, enjoyable book. As mentioned in previous reviews, the premise would have made an excellent leap to film, but the adapters did not bother with the character development of ANY characters, but most importantly, of Wanderer.  For that reason, much of the motivation is lost and therefore makes no sense to those who have not read the book. I would say to anyone watching this movie, definitely READ THE BOOK and forget about the film version.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Out of all the books I have read by Lois Lowry, this one is the one that I have most enjoyed. Her imaginary dystopian world makes me rethink what I take for granted, such as freedom, or simply color. The mysterious end makes me want more.  I recommend this book to anyone older and who understands our world today.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I love the collection of Harry Potter in blu ray. Perfect gift for a HP fanatic. The quality of the movies is amazing,
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|First, I loved it on BD. Next, several 1 star reviewers got it wrong. For example, one says it's a one season wonder, while \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" on July 17, 2013 has an internet article about: \\" 'Orphan Black' creators tease season 2: 'Expect to hit the ground running' \\". Another critic here points to an aspect ratio of 1.33, which is a known, occasional error made by Amazon for NTSC [USA standard] high def. The show on BD is now shown by Amazon to be 1.78 widescreen, as expected.<br /><br />This show is a suspense, science-fiction containing, mystery-procedural starring Tatiana Maslany as the title \\"orphan\\" [Sarah]; although Black is not Sarah's last name. The \\"s' \\" is not a typo; and Tatiana Maslany plays all the \\"twin\\" clone characters. That she slips smoothly from Sarah's personality to the distinct character of other clone(s), is a measure of her fine acting chops. [The finest example of this I have ever seen, is one unforgettable scene in Kirosawa's \\"Kagemusha\\" where the lowly person character transforms \\"on stage\\" to the feudal lord character.] There are multiple puzzles to be worked on in the series, as to who is doing what to whom, what the various relationships are, etc. Some portions of a brief graphic nature may offend, yet they are in harmony with the spirit, sense of the show. [Minor spoilers] There are some \\"street-life\\" characters, and there is a gay club scene in one part. However, the world is as it is, and it includes all kinds, as a fair observer will agree. One clone is the proverbial, suburban soccer-mom!<br /><br />As a suspense mystery with someone murdered at one point and others in danger, the show has a somewhat dark or overcast look, with a somewhat dull color scheme so the colors underscore the nature of of the show as a murder mystery. Yet, on BD the show has a crispness and wonderfulness in its color palette and design that is seductive, wonderful. The last episode of season 1 is action packed throughout, and leaves multiple cliffhangers for season 2. I can't wait. Grrrrr.<br /><br />I first tried this show as the \\"HD\\" trailer, then the first episode [then free via Amazon Prime] with my 50 MB/s internet connection, and the Amazon prime streaming was lacking, mediocre at best. The window on my computer showing the episode was smallish, and the crispness and richness of my later BD experience was very much lacking. Streaming sucks the life out of what is otherwise a fine show IMO. Not to mention that the sound is much improved on BD into my HDTV's A/V setup, compared to listening to computer audio. On Blu-ray Disc, I find this show to be compelling, very enjoyable, while the \\"same show\\" was sort of a bust, okay at best, for me when streamed. I would think that the show is about PG-13, NOT for small kids.<br /><br />There are a number of strong female lead TV shows on these days, including Continuum, Covert Affairs, and Orphan Black, all of which I like in various ways. \\"Orphan Black\\" is its own unique thing, a treat for those who like intelligent puzzles and tolerate various lifestyles. The DNA, nature vs. nurture, or heredity vs. environment question is intelligently investigated in this intriguing show.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|an interesting journey into the world of ballet and the torturous impact of it's competitive underbelly. Natalie Portman was certainly deserving of all accolades.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We will be watching this for many long winter nights when there's nothing else on TV.  One of the few things we keep!
B00005K3O0|5.0|It was good and had great story plot.  Because it was a true story I felt I was now Audry Rose herself in my body of Jesus Christ. born along.  Audry Rose Saint Agnes of God
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|The situation is a bit far fetched, but the acting is great and the family interactions are great!  Truly makes one think!
0062255657|4.0|Written from the point of a young boy, the author uses the boy's fears and self imposed isolation to introduce him to the mystical world of his neighbors. At times we watch the boy encounter difficult situations fostered by his nanny and father, but the belief that he will be safe with his neighbors helps us to breathe more easily. A thoroughly enjoyable journey between reality and magic.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|Great movie if you're a horse person - fair acting and it DOES tell the story of a great horse.
B006YC74E8|2.0|This is a great simple to use editor,  but I am confused as  to why the edited photos do not show up in the camera gallery. Instead they look the same, but the edited versions can b  found once in the app. I was hoping they could be save  to the gallery outside of the app, or could a  least override the photos in the gallery. There is an option to override but th  photos still look the same. Edited photos are only accessible in the app itself.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|Meryl does a wonderful job as usual bringing Margaret to life.  The flashbacks were not what we expected, but it is a very good film.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I enjoyed this latest segment of the Bond seiries. I think that Daniel Craig is the best Bond of the group. Skyfall is action packed the entire movie.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|These movies got better as they went along....and this one was almost the best...just wish they had stuck to the book a bit more religiously.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Downloaded it - downloads fast - it works as expected showing me all that i want and need. It is great.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|It deserves the best picture Academy Award - great film bringing an almost forgotten piece of history alive.  It has the right touches...
B004SBQGHS|5.0|So many birds to slingshot across the screen, so little time! This game is challenging on so many levels. I love the 3D graphics! They make you want to leave no stone standing.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Intense, realistic, and well done.  This is a film with many messages and extremely well done.  One to keep for all time.
B00008973A|5.0|I bought this for my father, who only had this on VHS.  Little upgrade for him, and it was easy.
B00CWGLOY6|5.0|When I first saw Saga on the shelves, I thought about giving it a look, but I passed it by.  That's a bad thing and a good thing.  The bad thing was I almost missed out on a terrific book.  The good thing is I didn't have to wait month to month like a lot of those readers who jumped on the bandwagon early.<br /><br />Brian K. Vaughan has some massive kung fu when it comes to writing.  I've read a lot of his superhero stuff but never got into Y: The Last Man.  Dunno why.  It just never appealed to me.  The art in that book didn't speak to me either.<br /><br />The art in Saga speaks plenty, though.  That was the first thing that made me notice the book.  Fiona Staples' pages are crisp and clear, beautifully rendered in colors that entice the eye.  It's really easy to finish the book and then just wander back through the pages to see everything again.  I was blown away when I learned that Staples is doing all of this on computer and providing the art AND the coloring every month.  She's a comics writer's dream.<br /><br />The story, according to Vaughan, owes to his love of Star Wars as well as the impending birth of his second child.  Saga is about a love story, and a lot of reviewers have compared it to Romeo and Juliet, which is a fair juxtaposition I think.<br /><br />However, Vaughan brings so much more to the table than just a retelling of star-crossed lovers.  His imagination in this book soars, and he deepens each of his characters enough to make you really feel for them - even when they're the bad guys.  Of course, there are a number of shifting alliances in the story and things will probably not turn out the way they at first seem.  Vaughan likes playing with readers' minds like that.<br /><br />The series is also a brilliant mashup of science fiction and fantasy.  I couldn't for the life of me figure out why Alana and Marko were trying to take their newborn daughter to the Rocketship Forest.  Then, when they arrive, the answer is perfectly simple.  I won't spoil that one for you.<br /><br />I wondered if the large cast of characters was going to be a problem when I first started reading.  Getting distracted from the main story is always irritating to me.  The trick Vaughan has for that is simple:  it's ALL main story.  Every character, every nuance, every what-seems-to-be bunny trail all plays into the story.  Everything matters.<br /><br />I have to give kudos to Vaughan and Staples for creating what is possibly the creepiest character I have ever seen - even surpassing the Aliens created by H. R. Giger.  The Stalk (bounty hunter extraordinaire and totally merciless) gave me chills the first time I saw her, then when I saw her completely unveiled, I was even more shocked.  You'll know what I mean when you find her in the graphic novel.<br /><br />What seems like a simple story is intricately woven.  If I was following this story through the monthly issues instead of picking up the graphic novel installments, I'd be freaked.  But getting the graphic novels helps satiate the need to know what's gonna happen next by getting a bigger piece of the pie all at one time.<br /><br />I'm looking to a long run on this series, even if it leaves me twisted with anticipation on each final page while I wait.spoil that one for you.<br /><br />I wondered if the large cast of characters was going to be a problem when I first started reading.

B000YDE4FA|5.0|I bought this pair of shoes after reading the reviews, and it was true that Timberland makes their shoes half a size bigger than standard. I am a size 8, and I bought a 7.5 and it fits me perfectly. The shoes is extremely comfortable and good for outdoor activities and city life. I highly recommend it.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|JAWS remains a classic tale of adventure featuring one of the best 'monsters' in film history. It has an excellent script, characters, action sequences and a great villain - the 25 foot shark.  But, what truly makes this film a classic is the aura and feeling created by Steven Spielberg. He perfectly crafted a movie from a great adventure book (written by Peter Benchley), presented characters (beautifully and emotionally portrayed by a mixture of veterans and newcomers (Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw, Richard Dreyfuss, and Murray Hamilton), dramatic conflict between man and beast (nature) and a story of fear of the unknown and uncontrollable.  Add to this a menacing villain (a monster shark) and you have a classic thriller which is one of the best films of all-time. We get a sense of time and space as the film moves from land to sea. We see the conflict grow from man and man, man and beast, man and nature and ultimately man versus man's emotions. Finally, Scheider, Shaw and Dreyfuss form a bond through their gestures, dialog and shared quest like few ensemble casts have been able to do so on film.  I consider this a film of perfection thanks to Spielberg, Joe Alves (technical) and Carl Gottlieb (script) and the incredible cast. I remain a fan of this massive undertaking by the makers of the film.  I still consider this one of the top twenty films of all-time.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Book was not boring.  Easy to read and story moved along quite nicely.  Made me want to see the Jack Reacher movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved both Despicable Me movies, and this free app does not disappoint.  This runner uses enough resources to have problems running smoothly on my kids' kindle fires, but runs like a charm on my kindle fire hd.  The mechanics remind my a lot of 'Agent Dash'.  As usual, there are in-app purchases available, but they are not by any means necessary.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This book was the hook to encourage reading the entire series of books.  Really enjoyed the historical setting and the development of the characters.  Enjoyable.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|This game is great for playing at Renaissance Faires. I got it sine the King of the court where I perform brought it and we played it. The audience loved watching. Card have the renaissance theme on them and is perfect. The only thing I would have liked with it was the card should have been in plastic sleeves to keep down the wear. i went and got sleeves.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|You have to keep reading to see what happens to the characters in the story.  The author creates personalities you love, dislike, and others you would like to see disappear.  Vivid descriptions and page turner.
0785153942|4.0|This is the first graphic novel I have actually bought.  Good read before I saw the movie, cant wait to see it again.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like the addition of reward points for watching videos, surveys, checking maps, and other things. It's a fun format.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|I've been waiting for this album for 30 years or more. It sounds like they started where they left off only the lirics are more mature than the old stuff. Also, Geezer Butler kills it with his bass and Toni Iommi's solos are blazing compared to 30 or 40 years ago. Ozzi's voice sounds the same. I really like this album and I listen to it alot. It's about time!!!!
0425263924|5.0|LOVED IT!!! Sylvia Day is AWESOME!!!! Couldn't wait for the each and every one of the Crossfire Books!!! STEAMY HOT!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this game and so does my seven year old granddaughter. We like to play together. It is easy to play.
B008S4YZCO|4.0|Runs better on the newer kindled. Thanks for a fun clean app for the kids in this time of violence and fear.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I will not recommend this game to any new players until they fix the issues they have within the game and within the greedy company!! They take credits and coin from you an will sa its cause you didn't buy them or earn them.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Wonderful cast and scenery. Great story line. I really liked it and look forward to season 4. hope to see it on Amazon
B005544V6A|4.0|really good series so far! I'm hooked! I can say this is my series for the next 3 seasons. Nice!
B005LAIH2M|4.0|I liked the duo that the two main actor/actress brought together as an ass kicking family, was funny and entertaining to watch
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 6 year old grandson loves this game....He plays it all the time....He won't let me play it at all.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|First 4 levels are OK but it gets too hard after that, I ended up uninstalling the game, the graphics are somewhat OK.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My 6 year old grandson plays this all the time...His mom doesn't like the sound of the guy breaking his neck! I think it is funny
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game. Great for passing time and getting rid of boredom. easy to spend hours playing with out knowing it!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I wish the rain storm was better, but I use this anyway when I travel and can't go to sleep
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Very thought provoking in today's world! Especially with today's world of cyber bullying! I know someone personally going through all of this right now. I wish schools and laws were tougher to protect her.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I loved the DVD's very well made and very informative loved seeing the old footage from the early days. Amazon was great purchase was hassle free, shipping was fast as well. Overall very well pleased with both the purchase and the DVD.
B009JZSFUY|4.0|This movie was pretty decent, it seemed very contrived having Worf there, though. He wasn't necessary to the plot, so I don't see why they had to call him in. Also, new uniforms? Other than that, it's ok.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This is one of the best live recordings I have ever listened to.  You will not be disappointed.  Bonamassa is one heck of a guitar player.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Captivated you from beginning to end. Would recommend this to book clubs and anyone that likes to read.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This was a great app until you did an update.  It's almost impossible to move pieces from the sideboard onto the board.  The pieces jump around indiscriminately.  Please try to fix this.  It was great before.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's just so much fun to play this! I like to play it just to pass the time and have a little fun with my darkside. Thank you for helping me get in touch with my darkside, great app!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 is wonderful and FULL of drama! Can't wait till season 4.<br />I definitely recommend this series it is just so well made.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I never really loved \\"Step by Step\\" or \\"Face the Music\\".  I was a huge fan of their first two(three if you include the x-mas one) albums.  I never bought \\"the Block\\" but I've been feeling nostalgic and thought I'd buy \\"10\\" since my friends and I went to a concert when they toured through. The feel of this album brought me back to my 14 year old self that was totally obsessed, except the lyrics have matured more.  It's still pop, but less poppy with fewer corny lyrics.  Overall I LOVE it.  Well done boys!  I do miss you guys.  It's filled a a tiny void I had missed from my pre-teen/teen years.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Very entertaining book.  Not predictable at all.  Will look for more of Blake Crouch books. Would recommend to a friend.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The idea behind this movie makes me happy. CIA agents don't just disappear after they retire. I am sure they struggle to find their own way. this hillariouse cast makes this awkwardly funny movie work. the Retired and Extremely Dangerous crew are amazing.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Anything is possible with brain and heart. That's how law is suppose to be~ Love this show!! Can't get enough of it. Go team Harvey~
B00000K3CR|5.0|This movie was good when it first came out and now my kids enjoy it.  This movie is for the kid in all of us.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I absolutely loved this story. It had me reading late into the night. It had me wishing I did not have to go to work! I was torn between wanting to know what happened and not wanting it to end. The footnotes added to the humour of the story but this technique does not translate well to the kindle version as it is too hard to flip forward and back to see them but otherwise I would highly recommend this story.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|I'm into all kinds of magical, witch and vampire movies. I loved the story line and the actors were great! I gave this 5 stars because I felt it was well put together and I anticipate a part two.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I bought this on my Kindle after having read Matched. The first book in the series was quite enjoyable. No where near The Hunger Games but a decent book. Crossed, however, is just no longer an appealing book to read.<br /><br />In a nutshell, all this book is Cassia finding Ky and finding out more about the Rising. There was no any particular event that blew me away or anything of the sort. One thing that kept bothering me was the excessive use of poetry in this book. I mean,come on, Emily Dickinson probably would have gotten a migraine after reading this. Albeit, I do not usually find poetry as appealing as reading a novel, but it was just too much. I feel that the author could have at least used more well-known poetry (Edgar Allen Poe? Robert Frost?) to develop a better connection of her dystopian world with the readers. Quite honestly, I usually skimmed through any mention of it. This is a dystopian novel about government control and people go on and on about poetry the most? Seems unlikely. The author probably enjoys poetry immensely and tried to incorporate it into her novel but ultimately failed. I feel like using riddles would have been more interesting to use.<br /><br />The narration style was also not used to its full potential. Ky and Cassia sound exactly the same: their thought processes, \\"philosophical\\" ways of thinking about life, etc. I don't think the author has quite mastered the art of developing a complex character, their why's and justified actions. It took me a few chapters to realize what was going on and I had to re-read it to realize that it was two viewpoints.<br /><br />In retrospect, I did not like the book as much as the first. True, the author did write decently enough in the first to have me somewhat invested in her characters, but fails to live up to anything in the sequel novel. It merits three stars for this: for developing an interest in characters and somewhat interesting plot. Two stars knocked off for excessive use of poetry andfor not developing the actual complex of the characters, not to mention having a bunch of fluff as a sequel.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|Great movie.  Once again, Jamie Foxx proves that he is an excellent actor, as well as Gerard Butler.  Keeps you alert and glued to the non-stop action the entire movie!!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This was an interesting book which kept you guessing until the end. The start of a new series, I hope
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a good game but could use more places to go to<br />And more outfits you can get with the bananas
B00B7ERH04|4.0|I really love the way this easy to use app works its so fun and easy :) !!!<br />So come on and get it it's amazing fantastic fun....
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Great movies, great quality, great price. What more can you ask for. If you want to upgrade from DVD to blu-ray, now's the time.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This is my favorite and one of the best murder mystery ever written. I recommend this book to anyone ready to rattle their brains trying to solve this riddle.
B002RHL8DC|4.0|I watched all 40 episodes recently and found this to be quite entertaining.<br />While traveling I watched some episodes on a tablet using headphones if the hotel wifi speed was adequate.<br />If you are a science fiction fan you probably would enjoy this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm addicted.my son and nephew loves it too. You should definitely give this game a try. It is great. We stay challenged with the missions and shopping for new items.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Haven't seen anything this good since The West Wing! BRAVA!<br />Highly recommend for intelligent entertainment.<br />So glad I can watch it here again!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Might be the best one. Harry Holey is one messed up guy with a streak of sincerity and love that few others could even dream of being.<br />His demon - drinking - doesn't define him but sensitives him to perform better - in bed and on the job.
B001F12J0C|5.0|The Bourne trilogy is just pure excitement even though you know he will survive. I bought this on the Amazon one day sale and it was an outstanding bargain. Fun to watch the movies and the extras were nicely done. The extras are short (I suspect so they can be advertised as having loads of extras!). My advice, however, is to to check out the one-day pricing. Just solid value.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Two or three of the sounds annoyed me such as the white noise and one of the rains.  Worth getting though since its free.
B000K7VHPU|4.0|Ed Norton is a great actor. I hated him in the Italian job. He is a noble and interesting man in this movie. Great story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is so much fun and I feel like I have a real horse I love it so much so five stars
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book helped me think more objectively without bias. I can concentrate the exact truth of everything I experience with the opinions of this book.
1451638450|5.0|I always knew &#34;that idiot Ivan&#34; was no idiot!  Miles would have been stuck in some serious messes without Ivan's aid.  I have spent years rooting for Ivan and am very glad his day has come!  I won't say parts that pleased me most because it'd spoil the book.<br /><br />Lois McMaster Bujold's writing style in all her books is excellent.  She is truly a wordsmith!
B00B9E29CI|2.0|I could get informations about school education or system through reports shown in this book. But I couldn't read any contention of the author's own. So HOW can I develop or help our kids develop their character, Paul?<br /><br />I felt pitful to read Chicago innercity kids' problems. If there is the free abortion service which the (expecting)single moms can choose without guilty pressure of christianity, then is it not helpful? How about prohibition of guns and more strict control of drugs? Although here are many or more educational problems in South Korea, I haven't see at least the above three ones with my own eyes. The abortion is illegal too in South korea, though.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Wow, easily the worst magic duels of the planeswalkers yet, they are usually pretty good. I think the design or content teams were farmed out or something. Its like they felt that their game was too good? Much? The games before had challenges based on classic magic stack interactions and showed a deep understanding of the game, the challenges in this one are a joke. One of them is just &quot;do as much damage as you want&quot;. That is not a challenge!<br /><br />The biggest crime is the sealed gameplay, you get two chances at sealed, you can buy others (or maybe just one) for 2 bucks. Thats it, no deleting decks, also, you play fully constructed decks. So not only does it NOT let you practice sealed gameplay it also doesn't allow you to practice sealed deckbuilding.<br /><br />Total fail. The decks arent as interesting but that can be fixed with dlc and is a somewhat moot criticism anyway. I would wait for dlc before you drop 10 bucks.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Because my Kindle will still not charge up.  It was not the connection.  I know that my Kindle is over a year old but it should last longer than this.. I will not buy another one
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|We have a late model 3-D capable 60&#34; flat screen which works well beyond belief.  This movie does not disappoint using this equipment.  Very high quality Blu-ray and worth every cent.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This was a good read but not the Kite Runner.  It was a little like the White Tiger. I wanted the end to be different.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is a great game! It like a mix of temple run and subway surfers, ( both are free great apps, please get) but in despicable me form! No app is perfect. But this app came pretty dang close. Pro: it's fun and addicting, con: there are pop up adds (not many and you can turn them off.) Pro: there are so Many pros I can't write them all down!<br />Minion rush may be simular to other games , but there many more fun challenges and powers ups!<br />There are many great games but this is by far one of the best! Take my advice and get this app!
1442359919|5.0|A fun summer read to get you intrigued.  I wish it were longer.  Great characters and story line get interest going.
1742200508|4.0|My experience has been that Lonely Planet never lets me down!  I have big dreams of visiting England and have been (sort of) planning my trip for ages.  I have got several different Travel Guides and the ones that have some pictures are my favorite.  While this doesn't have pictures on every page, it does have a section with them.  It's easy to read and navigate the book, and has all the information I would need/want for when I am able to travel.  Once I do go, I'll have to update my review!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun and you should play it all day long because you will get addict to the game
B005DESVPO|4.0|Saw Clark perform on one the morning network shows.  Had to have it.  Like the bluesy rock, although some lyrics are a little edgy.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I enjoyed In the Name of the Wind, a great read.  But in The Wise Man's Fear, Kvothe leaves the university and more is learnt about him and his reputation.  A fast read for a book this long.  And now the wait begins for the The Doors of Stone.  Another Eragon...when will it be released???
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love this series. I really like book like packaging on these! The outside is textured to feel like an old book. Great purchase and a great idea for any LOTR fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is awesome I'd give it a 1000000000 star I love the fluffy unicorn and it 100 times better the<br />temple run
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins strikes again! Everyone must pick up this book! It is everything I expect from James Rollins! I love how he always incorporates science and history! Two of my favorite subjects!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game very fun for.fans of.the movie. the only thing is that if freezes when I am about to start it over all it is an amazing game
B00B6DTWM2|4.0|I thought it was full of suspense and ended very unexpectedly. I liked that it had such a different turn at the end.
B0091REZMW|5.0|More more more that is all I can say except play! Its has great traffics and the storyline keeps it interesting! So much to do.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger games series it takes me from reality in to this adventure. The love story in this book is nothing like other books it's so unpredictable. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I loved Nicholas Hoult in The Skins so I knew I had to see Warm Bodies on Amazon Instant.  What I wasn't expecting was how much I enjoyed it.  Its a new take on zombies that we've never seen before and overall, tremendously acted.  I've been telling all my friends to watch!
0345525558|3.0|A novel is good if it is entertaining or educational, or both. The Language of Flowers achieves both, but not very much. After reading it, I gain some knowledge about the meanings of different types of flowers and the foster care system in the U.S.  But I am not sure if this knowledge has any significant impact on me. As for motherhood, I don’t need to read a novel to understand or appreciate it. I am also drawn into the life and person of Victoria, the main character, enough to keep me interested for several hours reading it without interruption. To me, that’s entertaining. But an entertaining activity shouldn’t stop when the<br />activity is over. It should have a long-lasting influence on the participant. It should make the participant feel he or she wants to do it again. I am entertained by Venessa Diffenbaugh while reading The Language of Flowers. But will I read another book written by her? Probably not.<br /><br />Many reviewers criticize that Victoria is unlikeable. But if a writer is successful in creating such an impression, he or she is a good writer. The problem is that it’s not whether Victoria is unlikeable.  It’s the credibility issue.  And this has a lot to do with the point of view Venessa Diffenbaugh uses in building up her characters. Diffenbaugh takes a risky approach when she decides to use the first person point of view (POV). Perhaps she does not have a choice. The novel is character-driven, not plot driven. It’s best to use the first person POV so that Diffenbaugh can reveal the innermost feelings of Victoria to the readers.  However, writers who use the first person POV in novels must be very careful. The risk in using the first person POV is especially heightened when the character changes significantly. It’s hard to keep the intimate thoughts or feelings consistent, especially when there are flashbacks or events in two different time periods are told in parallel. Diffenbaugh falls right into the dangerous first person POV trap when she lets Victoria tell her story as an eighteen-nineteen year old young woman and as a nine-year-old girl in alternate chapters. As a nine-year-old girl, Victoria tells her story, acts, and talks the same way as when she becomes eighteen. A nine-year-old cannot say something like, “I compared my quiet existence at Elizabeth’s to all the things I had previously understood to compose a life . . .,”  or “I imagined it to be the way a mother looked at a biological daughter, whose every limb had been formed within her body.”  Even if the story of this nine-year-old girl is told by a young woman, the contemporary expressions (e.g., “I imagined,” “I wondered,” “I felt”) are attached to this nine-year-old girl.  By putting the words of an adult into a child’s mouth, Diffenbaugh betrays her nine-year-old character. Half of the novel loses its credibility. But that’s not the whole problem. Victoria, an eighteen year old young woman who receives little education and has been rejected by society, tells her story with a tone of a well-educated mature woman.  Diffenbaugh “shows” other people’s behaviors and feelings through their expressions and actions, but the mere fact that the expressions or actions that speak for these behaviors or feelings are observed and recorded through the eye of an eighteen-year-old indicates that this eighteen-year-old has an eye of a psychologist, or at least of a mature, caring and thoughtful person.  Again, Diffenbaugh betrays her less educated, immature, and rebellious character. Another half of the novel loses its credibility.<br /><br />The plot is reasonable but the ending is somewhat disappointing, considering all the preparations and built-up suspense. The dialogue scenes are a bit awkward. It seems Diffenbaugh constructs a rigid framework for her characters and tries to fit her characters into this framework. All characters in the novel appear to talk in the same tone and manner.  The explanation of themeanings of flowers is a bit overdone, to the point of ridiculously academic. Despite these flaws and other minor mistakes, Diffenbaugh knows her craft well in other aspects. She is good at using strong verbs, powerful adjectives, spot-on similes, and effective metaphors.  She pays attention to details though her meticulous description of scenes or actions is tiring and mechanical sometimes. Her message is strong and clear.
B008JEJVXG|2.0|I bought this album after listening to the single off of it, thinking that I would be in for a treat.  I was sorely mistaken.  The songwriting on this album doesn't leave much of the same style, and in my opinion leaves much to be desired.  Just because it's indie doesn't mean it can't be uncreative.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome!! I read it in a day and a half! I felt all the emotions they had felt and pictured it all happen
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Case fits, and looks good on the Kindle.  I just wish that the price was a little lower because it would make the value better.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is fun for boys and girls of all ages. It's fun unlocking different sharks and finding different paths.
B007DIQC90|5.0|i've really started to enjoy this type of music lately.  folksy, wistful, a splash of rock and 'pop' music, it's very calming and enjoyable. most of these songs will get stuck in your head easily and it's easy to get lost in.  the singers' voices are unique (the guys voice at first i thought was like the singer in the Decemberists, though i haven't heard them in a long time, so i may be mistaken) and the instrumentals are fantastic. all around good purchase and very interested in what's to come from this band.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|I like how the extra graphics to the game gives the game player a little burst of emotion. Anyways this game .. I think is very well<br /> made and there are helicopters, tanks military jeeps so, I like the way it's formatted<br />R
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|It gives a great perspective of two woman's life in Afghanistan through the country's period of struggle. Full of twists and well-written
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Saw it first in Florida and couldn't wait to see it here in Dayton, Ohio. (Although we didn't catch it at the movies, so we ordered it) Went to a friends home to view it again, and THEY loved it. The music was wonderful and we reconized a few of the artists. We are fans of Maggie Smith (of Downton Abbey) and now appreciate Dustin Hoffman even more. Thanks to all for a wonderful movie! B & K Summers
B0009P66TK|5.0|Excellent styling, construction and accuracy. Very comfortable to wear given the large face of the watch.<br />Amazon price is also a huge factor. Paid $85 CDN and got free shipping as well.<br />I may buy another just to have a spare for dressy occasions.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I L-O-V-E Pinterest. Literally any project, any recipe, any idea is at the normal, non-creative person's fingertips! Just yesterday I was able to clean my child's urine from our mattress which he peed on using baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and dish soap. Before Pinterest I would have been upset and worried that our wonderful mattress was ruined. I have pinned so many wonderful things and can't wait to try out all the recipes, party ideas, crafts with my kids, and make green cleaning products using products that most people keep in their home. am obsessed!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game leaves you thinking and trying outside the box recommend downloading you will not regret. However it's a bit trying so get your thinking cap on
B008PZ69T8|4.0|enjoyed the musicaL scores and instrumentation of the piece.  Recomend it to all clacicical music lovers.pleasant reADING MUSIC FOR ALL.
B00AQM8H9I|1.0|This game is not really that good at all. I'm glad I got it for free, because it just isn't all that great.  And don't accuse me of not getting it, I get it, it's just boring.
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />Though Man Of Steel had great production values, a handsome Superman (Henry Cavill), a brilliant Jor-El (Russell Crowe), and a competent cast overall, I found this to be a dark, militaristic version of the Superman tale. The film starts well, with Jor-El and Lara launching their infant son into space to avoid the destruction of Krypton. Russell Crowe was wonderful as always and looked awesome in his spandex (he must have worked out hard to achieve spandex perfection!). But I found other elements of the film less wonderful; for example, Kevin Costner was playing Kevin Costner, and I felt that though she was good, Diane Lane was miscast as Ma Kent. But I went along with the story changes and understood the desire of the director to take a different direction with the mythology, at least until the last 40 or so minutes when the movie degenerated into a repetitive and un-exciting battle between Kryptonians Superman and General Zod. It gets tiring watching super people throwing one another through buildings and destroying an entire city, especially when at the end of the fight, Superman simply wrings Zod's neck and kills him. Why didn't he do it 40 minutes earlier? (Okay, 38 minutes sooner) If Zod was going to die, why put us through so much overdone CGI? Also, in the original comics and previous incarnations of Superman, Superman NEVER killed anyone! Super villains were returned to the Phantom Zone, or wherever they came from. Crooks were sent to jail. Superman never ever would have wrung someone's neck. I found the gratuitous violence totally unnecessary and felt it denigrated the heroic qualities we look for in any re-telling of the Superman story.<br /><br />I would have given the movie 3 1/2 half stars if I had the option because there were many good elements, but I couldn't bring myself to give it 4 stars, so 3 it is. I know they'll do a sequel of some kind, and am not looking forward to it. For this re-boot, one was enough.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve's Superman was more fun, more true to the creators' vision, and suitable for kids to see. Reeve played 2 parts: the bumbling Clark Kent and the beautiful, charming Superman, contrasted with Cavill's single characterization of a Superman filled with angst and uncertainty, which for a guy who can fly and resist being killed by normal means, seemed a bit tough to believe. I suppose I'd recommend the movie if only to watch Crowe steal the show as he so often does.
B003UBTX72|4.0|Fun read. Keith is a more dynamic character than I'd realized and I thoroughly enjoyed his narratives of Stones' politics and industry history.
B00506NRBS|5.0|One of those books that makes you go \\"Hmm...  so the world is a pretty good place after all...\\"<br /><br />At this point, I read it myself and have recommended it a countless number of times to my friends.  Definitely something to have your your bookshelf.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great app, easy of use, clear interface and flexible and the design and swipe is much comfortable to read the ebooks
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Never would I have tried to negotiate over $$$ aspect of new job offer, should I had not read this book.  Sheryl points out that a part of the reasons why women earn less than male peers is that we don't ask, we don't attribute our success to ourselves and undermine our value.<br /><br />It was a nerve wrecking to ask for an additional few percent, but, hey, when it succeeded, it sure made me feel AWESOME! I earned $10K in a day!!!  I also highly recommend \\"You're Killing Me Here!\\" by Steve Reilly if you are further interested in learning about negotiation techniques.
B002ZG994U|4.0|You are going to buy this movie because you enjoyed it on the Big Screen.  The picture quality and sound are acceptable.  I have things falling off the furniture with my 5 channel entertainment speakers going at about 50%.  Enjoy
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is handy to have on the Kindle instead of having to go to the computer all the time as I don't have a smart phone.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|His take on the matter is definitely interesting on how he went about it and he's successful.  I get the con's out there, but if you can get past the &#34;bad&#34; and read the other suggestions he has you wouldn't have &#34;wasted&#34; your money reading what he has to say.  He has some very good valid ideas and points to make.  The Kindle edition wasn't that expensive either so why not hear him out was my take away.
B000Q1LCMI|2.0|I'm one of those people that will finish a book out of a since of obligation even when I'm not liking reading it.  I pushed myself through about 25% of this one because It was highly recommended to me by several people who thought it was the funniest book they had ever read.<br /><br />I didn't finish this one.  I started to feel a little stupid for torturing myself with it.<br /><br />Plus I love the richness of New Orleans, LA.<br /><br />I found reading the stories about the AUTHOR, John Kennedy Toole, and the history of the book MUCH better reading than the book.  The book was published posthumously after being pushed by the mother of the author.  He committed suicide in his early 30s in Biloxi, MS,  20 miles from my home town, partly because of his disappointment in the failure of his writings.  The book ended up winning a Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />I was so excited after reading the story of the book, plus I aboslutely love the richness of New Orleans culture, that I was THOROUGHLY disappointed in the book.<br /><br />I just found the main character so gross, dull, and disgusting I couldn't read it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and mind challenging game. Well for toilet time at least. Keep up the good work.<br />Looking forward to future lvls
B00AL6SM0S|4.0|fine performances all around, but none top the performances I already had. For instance, as Isolde, Nilsson is far better than Flagstad; both had fantastic voices; Nilsson added passion. And the Bodansky cuts are deplorable
B00D6SBOWG|2.0|... play this all time on IPAD  and hoped this version for Kindle would be similar.... not at all....very disappointing....
B00992CF6W|5.0|well Minecraft is my favorite app on my kindle... the only video game I play... so it must be good because I'm very picky about apps...the only bad thing is the kindle always gets updates way after apple products do... my cousin got the 0.7.2 update about a month ago and I still haven't gotten it...<br />I &lt;3 MINECRAFT
B00004U8P9|5.0|Bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  This book is definitely one of her favorite souvenir from the show.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|The case is real strong and fits perfectly on the phone and my girl friend loves it! I would recommend this product to anyone.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Perhaps me but I think this series is over; at least with Cruise at the helm. Well filmed but tired
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Greatly disappointed in the way Collins ended this trilogy as it read like she had a limited number of pages and ended the story as early as she could. The climax to the rebellion just ends and a trial is barely mentioned. Collins started with such promise but fails to deliver with Mockingjay.
B00004RFFS|4.0|My daughter has watched this movie repeatedly.  She loves the story line and enjoys the thrill.  I felt that the price was resonable.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I wiil be frank there was just to much yellow in the movie and it just was not my favorite.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|An excellent album but with the bonus of the Monster track &#34; All the right moves &#34; very catchy and very ear worm like.
B003XT603Q|4.0|I read this book while traveling in Japan. It was cool to be in the Tokyo locations mentioned in the book. Entertaining and easy to put down while traveling (that's right, the ability to put this book down is a feature!)
B000WMEAKC|4.0|Stop n stare and Apologize two big hits that were very well written. Need I say more. No I wont.
B00129I5SM|5.0|Third installment rocked! Can't wait to see how many &#34;friends&#34; Alice brings along to the party in the next one, Resident Evil: Afterlife.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|As a musician who played professionally for 10 years, &#34; Counting Stars &#34; is a phenomenal songwriting achievement. The album is very solid from the brilliant first track all the way thru. My hat is off to the songwriter or writers!
B002ZG98UA|5.0|The undead creatures get more imaginative with each film, which is great. Can't wait to see what they come up with next!!!
B000086EOB|4.0|I first bought this album as an actual L.P. record when I was a teenager. Then got the cassette now the C.D. This album is stronger than a lot of bands entire set list.
B003VANOFY|1.0|**UPDATE** AUG-23-2016<br />I have purchased G933 and I am very happy with it (please read my G933 review).<br />As for G930. I don't know whether Logitech new software and firmware fixed G930 disconnect issues. I don't have G930 anymore so I cannot comment on it. If Logitech lends me a G930, I will more than happy to test it for them<br /><br />**UPDATE** NOV-01-2015<br />Pros:<br />- Build quality<br />- Excellent input and output sound<br />- Absolutely NO buzzing or hissing sound both while using wireless or wired<br />- Volume, mute, and three programmable buttons on headset<br />- You can mute mic by raising boom up or by simply pressing the mute button on the left ear<br />- A glowing red light provides a visual cue when the mic is muted<br />- You can use it cordless or corded (when the battery is low)<br />- Decent wireless range (approximately 30 feet)<br />- Surround sound can really help in some games<br />- Battery life is somewhere between 6 to 7 hours playing World of Warcraft<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Very poorly designed on/off switch.<br />- Disconnects a lot<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />G930 is comfortable, feature rich headset at a great price but it disconnects a lot, therefore I cannot recommend it anymore.<br /><br />Microphone on G930 is stuck on 1 Channel, 16 bit, 16000 Hz (Tape Recorder Quality). However, in my opinion 16KHz is more than enough to record human voice.

B008M721MS|2.0|I wanted to talk to my friend from Scotland. I tried to call her an  i could hear her but I couldn't see her. At one point we just gave up.
B00D2JAPSI|1.0|This is another vanity vehicle for Ms Bartolli, who has become, I must say, quite ruthless with the soprano repertoire. To call this \\"authentic Bellini\\" is purposely misleading, to say the least. This sounds more like Vivaldi gone mad. I dread that Puccini will shortly follow.

B001NLKWLW|3.0|The plot was interesting and held my attention, but the story was too wordy and moved slowly.  Reading it on Kindle was difficult because the chapters skipped around so much from generation to generation.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|If you like drama, suspense and comedy, then this your show!  Season Two keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Works well. Easy to maneuver. Download was easy.  Love to read my books on it. Page turn was smooth. Great.
