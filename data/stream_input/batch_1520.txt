B0084RSYEK|5.0|The movie was really good.  It totally took me by surprise.  Eddie Murphy was the perfect pick for this movie.  It was a heartfelt memory over true happiness and inner peace.  I enjoyed it.  It reminds me of the movie \\"Click\\" quite frankly but was still a one of a kind movie.I forgot to mention that I almost died laughing so hard!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love playing temple run and I have been waiting for ever to get the game. I like playing temple run so much my family loves it too.
B000PKX2KA|1.0|It does not work ,old software , causes blue screens , crashies computer,what more is ther to say ,maybe its made for windows 98 ? it does not work on windows 7 or vista,
0307891372|4.0|The guidebook is BIG.Very impressive and FULL of important information about everything Skyrim.I mean , the VERY first day I got it (just less than an hour ago) I used it.I contracted vampirism in the game and instead of stopping the game to go to say TES:Skyrim Wikia , I paused the game and quickly learned to travel to Morthal ,meet Falion ,acquire a Black Soul Gem and have Falion perform a Ritual to rid me of the disease! Right to the point and I moved along to whatever I was doing at the time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|At first I was upset with the direction this book went in, but now I realize that it couldn't have been done better! People don't like this book because Suzanne Collins didn't stick to the usual perfectly happy ending. It's not all rainbows and butterflies. But Collins did something better. She made it real, she made it believable. Lets face it-after everything that's happened in those books, it's not going to end all happy. But what I liked about it is the fact that the characters are trying to piece their life back together with what they have, making the best of it. Not many authors that I know of have accomplished such an amazing ending. So maybe their life didn't have a fairy tale ending, who's does? Collins made this book real, and that's what makes it absolutely amazing.
0062183591|5.0|The book was recommended to me by a friend who studies ethics.  The book was good for some insight into cheating, but the book gave me FANTASTIC insight into human behavior.  The book took the \\"morality\\" out of the reasons why we do or don't lie.  The book will tell you that one's morals do impact \\"cheating\\" behavior, but there is much much much more that influences our honesty other than if someone is good or bad, honest or dishonest, a cheater or a good guy.  It turns out that lying / dishonest isn't as black and white as I once thought!<br /><br />The helpfulness in this book is that I have new insight into WHY someone might not have told me the truth -- and most importantly, it will help me set the stage to help people be more honest.<br /><br />The book is full of psychological studies which are simple enough for a layman to follow.  And the results of these studies are repeatable -- and insightful.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone in a position of leadership... or even for anyone that could use some entertaining cocktail party small talk.  I read it in a day -- very easy to read, and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Fascinating, useful book.  STRONGLY recommend.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|the book was so well written and i loved every bit of it it was so powerful and on of my favorites
B002BAWIWU|5.0|I'm so glad I downloaded this collection!!<br />I just love it and I'm thrilled with the sound and the selections of songs.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|what more can you ask for?  this thing comes in handy since I carry it every where.  love the tip calculator
B000GCFY0I|4.0|This book is like nothing i've read before. It may not the best or most well written book in my opinion, but there was something about it that kept me from putting it down until i was done. I like how Tally rebels from the controlling society, even though it's what she's grownup knowing.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I love these kind of games.  if you like huntting for hidden objects then this game is for you.  great game. a lot of fun..
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|All I can say is get all three books, read them and share them.  Great, exciting book series.  I just wish there were more.
0062011847|5.0|Overall the book seems to be somewhat of key with other \\"City Watch\\" novels and feels even darker and less humorous then \\"Night Watch\\". Nevertheless it has very captivating story, full of classic Pratchett's witticisms and ends on a very satisfying note.<br />Even as I was putting \\"Snuff\\" down I new that I will re-read it more then once in the future.<br />So as a continuation of Discworld and City Watch novels it's 4/5, but as a book on it own it's a definite 5/5 and is a very well recommend read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Initially I thought I wouldn't like James' trilogy because of the heavy sadist content in the first book, but the entire series is a great lesson about life and relationships...I couldn't put my book down and had to quickly download Book II and III on my Kindle App...cannot wait for Part IV to come soon hopefully! The Amazon service was expeditious and infallible...great place to purchase these books and at a reasonable price for the electronic version!
B0088TG252|5.0|Yes, the plot has been done before; however, I thought the Washington's and Reynolds's characters were fresh and well acted.  Washington always does well at being both good and bad at the same time.  Reynolds, who I honestly didn't expect much from, did outstanding.  I thought he brought a very human quality to the character of a man deciding whether he wants the reality of his dream job. I liked that he wasn't suddenly some ubber-Bourne assassin; he actually grapples with being out-of-his-league and the moral ramification of what his job requires of him. Overall, well worth the money and time.
B002GHHHPQ|3.0|I have seen this movie several times and enjoy it every time I see it. Thus I wanted my own copy.<br /><br />However, this DVD is listed as \\"Widescreen Version\\" on side B. What you get is actually letter boxed widescreen squeezed into a 4:3 format. This is not true widescreen as you have black bands all around a much smaller picture when viewed on a widescreen.<br /><br />I was disappointed to say the least.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Fans of the first book will enjoy this next book in the series.  Suzanne Collins keeps you turning the pages and wanting more.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I've owned a few headsets, triton and a few off brands, but nothing compares to the clarity of the sound and the mic, of this headset. Makes me feel like an idiot spending hundreds of dollars on cheap headsets, when all along I should have boughten this in the first place I give it an eleven out of ten, it even comes with batteries, so you can plug and play. Just make sure you have a large stock of aaa batteries cause when you put this on you won't want to take it off.
B007UQ5Z1G|1.0|Look guys, there's a difference between change and alienating your audience. Change: Iron Maiden. Listen to their entire discography. All 15 albums. There's a clear natural progression between every album. They change with every album while keeping their signature sound; in other words they try something new and they adapt while still staying true to themselves.<br /><br />Obviously Linkin Park seem to think we live in a Twilight Zone episode means \\"having a sound you're known for and then trying something new with very few shades of your true self\\".<br /><br />Here's what made this album especially bad, the band said they would mix everything that they've ever done so far all together. And the first single seems to make you think that will indeed happen. I heard the heavy rock guitars and synths and vocals mixed together, and I liked it. I didn't buy the record (not getting gypped three times in a row) but I listened to the free iTunes stream through my iPad, front to back. And it's clear, the band are DONE.<br /><br />The intro track, Lost in the Echo had me thinking \\"wait, this means what they told us before the album comes out tomorrow is true right?\\". After a slow intro, suddenly it burst into a typical HT/Meteora track with rapping, raspy vocals and killer guitar riffs.<br /><br />And that's where it ends. It's immediately followed by a strew of forgettable tracks (save for maybe Burn it Down), a la Minutes to Midnight. It's barely been a day yet and I can't remember Victimized or Skin to Bone. When Mike rapped a bit on Roads Untraveled I felt like it could redeem the album but after the track was over, it felt kind of \\"...meh.\\"<br /><br />Then \\"Tinfoil\\", the instrumental is decent. I guess it's no Cure For The Itch but it is alright. Nothing I'm going to write to my buddies halfway across the world about, though. The last track had subtle hints that it could redeem the album (in a way it sounded like The Little Things You Give Away) but alas, to no avail.<br /><br />One thing I'll say, though, is that the fact that theres very little guitar didn't bother me much. There hasn't been a truly memorably riff since, well, Numb from Meteora, and that was, what, maybe 7 years ago? Not that long of a time difference, but point is, maybe it's best that if you can't come up with memorable guitar riffs, don't abuse us any more than you already have with crappy track after crappy track!!! And Chester's vocals? Rubbish. He even uses AUTOTUNE on a few of the songs. That's right, FRAKKING AUTOTUNE!!! Thought the new Fun. album was painful to your ears? This is even more painful. In fact, the singer from Fun.'s abuses of autotune is a masterpiece by comparison.<br /><br />It's painful to think that a band once so talented and full of potential could release three crappy albums in a row. Sure MTM was cringe worthy at best but it had its moments (Given Up, In Between, What I've Done and The Little Things You Give Away come to mind). And in a way this is better than its cringe worthy predecessor, but just barely. To have three crappy albums in a row is just disgraceful especially considering the band have so much talent to begin with.<br /><br />Well, unless a miracle happens where their next album is magically good, to say that I'm done with Linkin Park is redundant. They've completely lost it. And if Amazon allowed me to write reviews in my native tongue of Canuck French (on that note, sorry if there's any grammar errors and what not, I sometimes have moments where my second language catches up with me), I'd be using way harsher words. Trust me./><br />One thing I'll say, though, is that the fact that theres very little guitar didn't bother me much.

B004QK5N5W|1.0|I found more good price and I tryed return. But they can not accept return before return windows close day.
B004SIP6N6|3.0|I love this movie, I watch the DVD now and again when I need something I don't want to pay too much attention to.<br /><br />So I bought the Blu-ray. I wasn't hoping for much, just slightly more clarity and some film grain, I guess, but all I got was more film grain. The edges are blurry and there's really no additional detail to speak of over the DVD release.<br /><br />So, I'd advise skipping this if you already have the DVD.
B000VD5I94|5.0|It had been years since viewing this movie last. What a great story...well worth the low price for a blue-ray to watch it again.
B001BYXO7K|5.0|I just purchased a Nissin Di866 Mark II flash for a birthday shoot this weekend.  Both items showed up on time.  This whole concept of having a battery cartridge easy enough to just put in the flash instead of messing around with batteries is a great one.  Very well made and easy to use.<br />I am looking forward to using these all the time.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Well I started reading this book because it was getting rave reviews and I have to say I am REALLY disappointed. The ending was totally unresolved. I'm sorry but I like my stories to have some sort of definitive ending. The whole time I was waiting for some big twist, but there really wasn't any. And then I was hoping for some justice and punishment for the villian and there wasn't any of that either. I guess after reading \\"Hunger Games\\" and \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" my standards are kinda high. Oh well. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Not worth it.
B0067R0APK|5.0|this is a very useful app. you should download it. it tells you the hour by hour weather conditions and is berry berry accurate
B004B32500|5.0|You really have to have an open mind for this one. It's one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. I knew I was going to buy it before it was even over.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is like any other solitaire game for electronic devices.  I would give it five stars if it weren't for the annoying ads that pop up after almost every deal. But being free I guess that's the price you pay.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|Bought this for Ipad on Amazon. Then realised it would have been cheaper to buy it as three books for Ipad.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|this app is very bad before u do anything chage to child safe mode ithas u make cascade and when you mix a human and a human and it says sex
B00785P2QC|5.0|I remember simmer city when it first came out. This is a good step forward and fun to play. love the graphics and how it kind of helps you along. I don't. mind allnthe tapping to upgrade or build.  I think it's. a great game all around.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is handy and very informative!! LOVE IT!! This app is handy for planning vacations or going to work.
B003MC5N28|5.0|this is a great, thought provoking book. i read it for English class and finished it in 3 days. yes the ending is a cliffhanger but i dont mind that. all in all a great book.
1416589473|5.0|Simple, cheap and the history is awesome!<br />I bought it cause it was cheap and then I was surprised, bot by the build, but by the content!<br />Great book!
B002VKE0XA|5.0|I've always loved this movie, but I've finally come around to owning it.<br />To me, this movie has, in a way, reinvented the horror genre. It takes<br />the everyday unexplained occurrences at home and gives it a whole new meaning.<br />Making it hit closer to home (pun intended). Even if the movie itself doesn't scare you,<br />the aftershock of it will, in the very least, make you feel disturbed<br />about being home alone in the dark. Definitely a must see in theaters<br />(if they ever feature it again) but if you have a great picture/sound system/crowd<br />the movie will be more than enough for a scary movie night.
159448385X|5.0|The book was in perfect condition, and arrived promptly.  It was excellent reading.  Amazon is my favorite place to buy books.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoy Oregon Trail because you can have fun playing it too although I think you should remove the part that you have to wait for energy points loose all them.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game was fun kids loved playing easy to get free coins lots hours playing yeah fun fun fun fun fun
0307730697|5.0|This book is such an amazing account of Adam Brown's life and it takes you through every struggle/every facet of his life. He was an amazing person who rose above serious struggles and injuries and never once gave up. The strength of his and his family's faith is awe-inspiring in itself. The author does a wonderful job of telling Adam's story. I strongly doubt anyone could read this book without either shedding some tears or at least getting a bit misty eyed. This book is a definite MUST READ.
B0086700CM|5.0|i got this game about 2 weeks ago and i thought that i would get super board of it just like i did with all of my other games. turns out i love it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it's so much fun! I love the game. fun but really easy. not hard at all. love love love love.
B00001ODGR|5.0|The quality of the video is decent, and the sound is amazing!! This is a fun concert to watch, and also one heck of a show. I wish that I would have been there, myself, to see it, but I was about 7 years old at the time. This concert DVD should be in the collection of every Styx fan. I love it!! :)
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|This is a real boring game.  All the hidden object rooms look like a pile of junk and seem to be the same thing over and over again.  This is the first G5 game I have ever played.  I don't think I'll be  playing any more of them.  The story was rather juvenile.  In the mini games I didn't have any idea of the object of the game.  One had lines with lit red dots but gave no hints of the oject so I finally just skipped it...then back to the hidden objects over and over!  Would not recommend this game to anyone over 7.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|I've read every single book by this author. Each time he sets one in Boston it's as if I'm standing on those same streets. I remember the places I have been to and seen and it's almost as good as being right there with the character's. From Prayers for Rain to Gone Baby Gone to Any Given Day (which was a surprisingly good read on baseball).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible it never has crashed on me!(yet) But who are we to complain, for no matter what at least the word of God is being told to us today!(And hopefully for a long, long time) Anyway, this app works great and is free what could be better!(Other than a million bucks...)
B004WJRF6C|5.0|This arrived within a good length of time. The quality is good. I could not get information about it after it was shipped (where it was), but arrived early enough, not to worry.
B000QUEHNK|3.0|This book was an interesting read.  Family issues are the center of the book and are told with some humor: \\"September\\" romance; daughters born during very different times - one a \\"war\\" baby, the other a \\"peace\\" baby and their different paths; ethnic quirks.  A lively read, but missing a little something.
B005DOKL3E|3.0|I bought this item with the expectation it was big enough to fit my Kindle Fire with its leather cover. It does not. I had to buy the other Belkin sleeve that fits my Kindle with its cover and my stylus. If you use a cover do not buy this. Otherwise I like the color and material.
B0081L391C|4.0|The description got it right, this movie was \\"hysterically disastrous.\\"  I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in theaters but it was well worth the rental fee.  I laughed, I rolled my eyes, I missed the old show, and I loved the ending.  Channing makes this movie.  Without him, Jonah Hill would have a huge flop on his hands.  Some of the comedy was too slap stick for my taste, but some of it really was genuinely comedic gold.  While the original series was somewhat serious, this movie makes fun of its self the whole way through, which I really did appreciate.  They were not trying to remake the series, but play with it's premise.  Overall, it made my night.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I purchased this book because it was on my book club's list, and got it through Kindle because I was a bit embarrassed to be seen reading it. The Kindle delivery was excellent, and the formatting was done well clear.<br />The story is mostly interesting, and quite a bit titillating. I do have experience reading romance novels in a range of writing levels, and there are two points to make about this book. The first, is that it is more erotic fiction than romance novel. The difference is like hardcore to soft-core pornography. Second, the writing is at best, fair. Everyone knows how to talk and act in their personal lives, but putting that action and interaction in written format takes practice, and the talent is not very evident in this book. there are certain mannerisms written into the character of Ana that were silly and annoying, but that is personal preference.<br />I enjoyed reading it. It had some funny moments, some I didn't enjoy, and then kind of ended very abruptly. I expect to read the rest of the series, but I'm not sure I want to purchase the rest of the books.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This is a nice little case and it protects as well as any case I've used for the Kindle.  It's mostly to protect against scratches and not impact.  It also stands pretty well, unlike the other Marware case I have that is supposed to stand.  The material feels decent.  It will probably stand up to a little abuse, but not too much.  I keep my Kindle in my purse and have been using this case for about a month and it almost looks as good as new.  I really have no complaints about the case.
0553293397|5.0|I read The Naked Sun (book two of the robot series) first. Then I went back to The Caves of Steel (book one). It is the excellence of book two that kept me in the series. The main characters Elijah and Daneel are great. Their adventures through Asimov's futuristic universe show that the more things change, the more they stay the same.<br /><br />Keep in mind, you will find some annoyances while reading this book. Especially if you compare it to the modern technological world. But they are so insignificant that the story blows by them. Read this book sci fi fans!
B0084RSYEK|5.0|Seriously worth watching! My husband, myself and our 10,12,15, and 16 year old sons enjoyed this movie...hard to find something everyone agrees on! We all agreed very good movie. Great story...great moral lesson...if you want smut...and vulgar humor...not for you...if you want a funny warm fuzzy movie...rent it.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this app. I've played a couple of other G5 games on my Kindle Fire, and they were pretty addicting. This one...this one angered me. First off, the minigames. They didn't even offer a tutorial to help explain what you were supposed to do. For instance, the minigame where they ask you to untangle the strings on a board. I figured out the first one by pure accident. Then the screen changed before I could even see what I had done! That was my first ever experience with something like that. Ever! Because there wasn't any sort of &quot;here's the gist of what you are supposed to do&quot;, I ended up skipping those.<br /><br />The next big complaint: Finding the transparent objects. Some of them are easy to spot, but some of them weren't eve  made visible until I used a hint. I admit that I have to wear glasses, but some of them were just bs to say the least.<br /><br />My final complaint is two-in-one, and this one is the biggest problem I have. Every time it came to a puzzle where you had to tell the difference between two pictures, some kind of glitch would happen. The first time, random stuff would just flash and vanish without me touching the screen. After a couple times of that happening, I thought it had cleared up. I found the items pretty easily without glitches on the 3rd puzzle like that with no problem...until the level completed. It froze my Kindle entirely. I couldn't do anything. When I finally got my Kindle to shut off, it wouldn't turn back on. I had a full battery; it took me hooking my Kindle up to my laptop to fix it. I didn't leave it plugged in for anymore  than 3 mins, but when I disconnected it, all was fixed. That happened twice. I uninstalled it immediately after the second time. Like I said, I've never had a problem with any of G5's other games, but this one is a total bust. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because when the game worked, it was kinda fun. Too bad it's sooo glitchy :(
8866130109|5.0|The quality of the nootebook is excellent. The size is perfect, I´would like prefer soft cover but It´s ok anyway.
B0078JRFZE|5.0|This was one of the best series I have ever watched.  Downton Abbey is filmed so that you feel like you are a part of the family--suffering all the trials and tribulations along with the family and celebrating all the wonderful moments that the people at the Abbey experience.  I loved this entire series and can't wait for the next season.  I watched all the episodes on my Kindle Fire and really enjoyed being able to go back and re-watch parts that really left an impression on me.  I cannot say enough about this series.  It is superb!
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is a fun app. it has lots of dimension and challenges. would recommend this others for their enjoyment. great app
B002RKSV2U|4.0|Several aspects of the book surprised and delighted me.<br />I didn't expect this to read as a novel, and it was not one, this was a philosophical thesis, and the result of some 30 years of research and contemplation which has not gone to waste.<br /><br />As a non-native English speaker I expected this to be a upstream struggle in comprehension - it was not. The language is only slightly archaic but overall is surprisingly down to earth once I got used to the style of the narrative.<br /><br />The logic and the examples used to support it were clear.<br />Charles Darwin did not make his conclusions lightly and had full understanding of controversial nature of his work, but felt it was necessary to express the truth that was revealed to him through his research. It is apparent from this book that he had discussed each and every point of the theory at length. Much with those who were like minded and just as much with those who opposed him. And he relates the counterpoints in this very volume along with his reasons for thinking why these counterpoints are invalid.<br /><br />On this what surprised me is that (at least to my knowledge) the biggest opponents of evolutionary theory today (let's call them creationists for simplicity) have not came up with any new counter arguments to it. Everything creationists are saying today against evolutionary theory Darwin has answered already in this very book. Should they only ready it and follow the logic.... but I digress.<br /><br />In conclusion I should point out that this isn't an entertaining book, and at times it does become tedious, but it's invaluable educational and historic piece that anyone interested in evolution and modern science should \\"suffer through\\" at least once.

0345803485|1.0|I'm a man of few words, so just let me say that this is the most boring book I have ever read.  Written on the level of a high school sophmore and the same level of intellect.  Don't waste your time or money -- this book's popularity is purely hype.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this app very much but it needs to be easier to manage...trucks stop running on its courses and its is hard to start them up again. But all in all it is a really fun app.
0345803485|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to read it and find out for myself what all the hoopala was about. I didn't hate the book but didn't really think it was that great, EXCEPT the ending leaves the reader wanting to read the next one to find out what happens to her!! Great for the author!! Great plot!
B007N5YJWK|5.0|Criterion stakes its claim to high-def Hitch with their Blu-Ray release of THE 39 STEPS, the 1935 British production that laid the groundwork for many a suspense-thriller - including the director's own \\"North By Northwest\\" - for years to come.<br /><br />Robert Donat stars as a Canadian living in England who gets wrapped up in an espionage plot involving a female spy who's promptly killed in Donat's flat. With little information to go on, other than the name of a small Scottish village the agent provided (along with a warning to avoid anyone with half their pinky finger missing), Donat sets off on a furious pursuit to clear his name and avoid the authorities who want him for murder. En route he meets a female traveler (Madeleine Carroll) who takes her time warming up to Donat and his fanciful story...<br /><br />Despite its age, \\"The 39 Steps\\" is an exciting thriller that also functions as a prototype for the \\"wrong man\\" genre that Hitchcock would dabble in numerous times throughout his career. Donat and Carroll generate ample chemistry with one another, and the film mixes humor with edge-of-your-seat suspense in a manner that would soon become a hallmark of the director.<br /><br />Criterion's Blu-Ray includes a 1080p transfer from a fine grain master positive. While the image boasts more detail than I've seen than any prior DVD release, there are still certain sections - likely just due to the age of the elements - that appear a bit soft. Extras include Marian Keane's 1999 commentary on the film; a 2000 Carlton UK documentary on Hitchock's pre-war films; 40 minutes of British broadcaster Mike Scott's 1966 interview with the director; the complete, hour-long 1937 Lux Radio Theatre adaptation with Robert Montgomery and Ida Lupino; a \\"visual essay\\" from author Leonard Leff; audio excerpts from Francois Truffaut's 1962 interviews with Hitchcock, and original production design drawings. Highly recommended!

B00475AYJQ|5.0|Book 2 of Kingkiller is a fantastic next step in the series, I would put it on equal footing with the first book, Name of the Wind. The issue that reviewers seem to have with WMF is that it doesn't move the plot along particularly quickly or efficiently, they feel like they are floundering without insight into the unraveling details. I disagree with this. The main issue that people seem to have is that the book is not the book they expected to read. What WMF does is tell Kvothe's story in its purest form. Just because it is 2/3 of the way through doesn't mean that we need 2/3 of the knowledge that Kvothe will have or 2/3 of the plot development or 2/3 of anything. When I read WMF, what I encountered was Kvothe's growth as a person, more of his background and the shaping of his character. The story is beautifully written, it is fluid and enticing and wonderful. The main feeling that I had after reading it was the dull ache of anticipation for the final installment. I can make no predictions about the third book, but if it continues on this path it will regarded as one of the best fantasy series written for years to come.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Its easy,  and complicated, and it will drive you nuts, but its fun and addictive, and with only 9 holes on the easy levels you will well practiced in bouncing balls off walls and finishing under par before you ever get tired of it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really like this app for my kindle fire. Its simple and I use it almost daily. I don't need many extras at this time but I'm glad they're available.
B005HSL626|5.0|its great and fun. its easy enough for my eight year old to play. it also keeps her busy for a long car ride to my sister's house who lives two and a half hours away.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I feel like I had been a little disenchanted with the fantasy genre when a friend recommended NotW to me. I hesitated through the first section about the 'three silences', it felt like prose for the sake of prose instead of telling an engrossing story, but I pressed on. Pretty much the moment after I got through that section, the feel of the book changed. Kvothe drew me in with his tale, his flaws, his complexity. Looking at Kvothe is like being given a secret view of a hero from his own eyes, a 'truth behind the legend'. It isn't the story of a person so much as an intimate look at what makes up a human being. If I was asked to imagine Kvothe in any setting, in any time period, in any universe, I could do it without hesitation. This is one of the best books I have ever read and well worth your time.
B003R1B9MW|5.0|Fantastic movie.  This movie is for both golfers and people who really like the feel good story.  This is based on true events.  The movie will keep you entertained from the start.  A movie to own so families can watch over and over.  You'll never get tired of the movie.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Absolutely loved the book.  Been a long time since I have read something so good.  Could not put it down.  Cant wait for the movie
B007SGM084|5.0|The books were so easy to read.  I read all 3 books in about 4 days because of the spell-binding characters.  Ana and Christian were mind-blowing!!!!  A must-read.

B00785P2QC|3.0|Aren't the dumpsters supposed to empty the garbage.Why do you have to go through an ad to play.Just so stupid.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I've read hundreds (if not thousands) of books over the years, and I still consider \\"Watership Down\\" to be my favorite.  I originally wrote the following in 1999 on a Watership Down discussion forum that no longer exists . . . (There are spoilers included, or they can be considered \\"things to look for.\\")<br /><br />It depends on where you are in your life when you read the book.  I read it for the first time when I was about 30 years old.  I found it interesting, but that was about it.  I was VERY busy with children and a career at that point in my life.  Not much time to get too deeply engrossed in anything.  Was nothing more than a good read.<br /><br />I read it for the second time when I was in my mid-40s.  It was a completely different read then.  It meant a lot more to me.  It represented a story of daring and courage - of a willingness to forsake the known for the unknown.  Courage.<br /><br />I then read it several more times thereafter.  My emotional attachment to the characters became an obsession.  I studied the rabbits as if they were actual persons.  All, except the rabbits of the shining wires, were given redeeming attributes, and even there Strawberry (I believe it was), was ultimately redeemed.  There was Hazel's (the chief rabbit) wisdom.  He wasn't a rocket scientist, but he drew on each rabbit's strength to the groups best advantage.  There was Bigwig's courage and strength.  Fiver's supernatural powers.  Clover (the biker chick)'s willingness to just go.  Blackavar's selfless loyalty to a good leader.  Even Pipkin, assuming it would lead to his death, went with Hazel to the farm out of loyalty to the one who would not let him be abandoned.  Then there was the fierce General Wundwort.  He forgot he was a rabbit, designed mainly to be food for the rest of the animal world.  He'd kick anybody's butt - rabbit, cat, dog, man, he didn't care.  Ya gotta admire that kinda attitude.<br /><br />I'm convinced Richard Adams never intended half the influenceand impact his first novel would have.  He wrote several others following that, but I only read one other (\\"Traveler\\" from the viewpoint of Robert E. Lee's horse), and I didn't think much of it.<br /><br />And, I've yet to say something about Richard Adams' colorful writing style.  I have several favorite passages, for several different reasons and depending on the mood I'm in.  For example:<br /><br />\\"A few minutes later, there was not a rabbit to be seen on the down.  The sun sank below Ladle Hill and the autumn stars began to shine in the darkening east - Perseus, and the Pleiades, Cassiopeia, faint Pices and the great square of Pegasus.  The wind freshened, and soon myriads of dry beech leaves were filling the ditches and hollows and blowing in gusts across the dark miles of open grass.  Underground the story continued.\\"  (\\"And Last\\" - last paragraph)<br /><br />\\"A few minutes later the rabbits had crossed the cart track and vanished into the copse beyond.  A magpie, seeing some light-colored object conspicuous on the empty slope, flew closer to look.  But all that lay there was a splintered peg and a twisted length of wire.\\"  (\\"The Shining Wire\\" - last paragraph)  I admire those passages for the feeling of here and now and immediate transitioning to the vast universe and time eternal.  Sorta hard to explain.<br /><br />I also like: \\"Such was Woundwort's monument: and perhaps it would not have displeased him.\\"  (Epilogue)  For the salvation Adams provided the General notwithstanding his assault on Watership Down.<br /><br />And: \\"And sometimes when they told tales on a sunny evening by the beech trees, he could not clearly recall whether they were about himself or about some other rabbit hero of days gone by.\\"  (\\"Epilogue\\")  For the sweet sadness at the knowledge that wise Hazel is getting old and his memory's starting to fade, signaling that his part in the greater scheme will soon be over.<br /><br />And then Pipkin for bravery when he knew it would mean certain death for him:  \\"Oh Bigwig, cried Pipkin, 'let me stay out there with him [fiver]!  You'll never miss me, and I can go on trying [to revive Fiver] ---\\"  (\\"Bigwig Stands His Ground\\")<br /><br />And Bigwig's courage and loyalty after he'd already been half torn to bits (it this regard, he was a lot like Woundwort):  \\"My chief rabbit has told me to defend this run and until he says otherwise I shall stay here\\"  (\\"Bigwig Stands His Ground\\")<br /><br />Finally, the story ends where it started, acknowledging the \\"circle of life\\" (decades before the term became popular).  First sentence: \\"The primroses were over.\\"  Last sentence: \\"Hazel followed [El-ahrairah]; and together they slipped away, running easily down through the wood, where the first primroses were beginning to bloom.\\"<br /><br />When you read it, if you get half of what I've gotten from it, it'll become one of your favorites too.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best season of Doctor Who that has been made so far. It has very, very few \\"off\\" beats, and overall it is utterly gorgeous. The storyline of (spoilers!) the Doctor's Imminent Demise ratchets a nice level of tension and pathos throughout the whole season, with plenty of fun little twists and turns along the way. This season also focuses particularly on River Song, who is a truly excellent character, and it's a real delight to find out the backstory of the woman from \\"Silence in the Library.\\" Amy and Rory, the Doctor's companions, also come really into their own, continuing the character arcs we saw established by the end of the previous season. And then there's the Doctor...Matt Smith does really just spectacular work here, and you can feel every nuance of emotion that goes through the Doctor's mind as he gets ready to sacrifice himself to save his friends, the universe, and time itself. I do wish he'd popped in on, say, Jack or Martha; granted Davis did nicely wrap-up their arcs with the Doctor when he was closing out End of Time, it just would have been a nice touch (although the bit about the Brigadier is just heart-wrenching). But if that's the closest thing to a \\"complaint\\" I can come up with...then I shan't complain at all! It really is just beautiful, opening with one of the best episodes ever (Impossible Astronaut/Day of the Moon) and closing with another (Wedding of River Song). I will say that it may not be the best place to start your Dr Who viewing -- \\"Impossible Astronaut\\" jumps right in to everything -- but if you've seen Season Five, you won't be disappointed at all; you'll be blown away.<br /><br />One sobering alert, however: this season seems particularly susceptible to bootlegging. Check your copy carefully. Even one DVD set that I purchased \\"direct\\" from Amazon (albeit fulfilled by a third party, The DVD Closet) turned out to be a pirated copy, which was very annoying as it was meant to replace the previous pirated copyI had received from Video Galaxi. (So far, I've gotten three bootlegs, and am still waiting to see if a legit copy is on its way.) Check your set, and if it doesn't have blue plastic holders for the DVDs, and the fold-out episode list isn't glossy on both sides, then you've got a fake. The flimsiness of the pirated copies' packaging should be enough of a give-away anyway, because the BBC usually does a really nice job putting their DVDs together, but I've noticed they've gotten a little flak here and there in reviews for this season being not as well-put-together as usual -- probably because people are getting pirated copies and don't know it! So just be careful about that, and don't be conned into thinking you have to accept a substandard knock-off; the legit version is readily available, not out of print or anything -- you just have to make sure you find it, and not the Ganger version!
B0001907DA|5.0|I was excited that all seven dvd's were like brand new.  There were no scratches on any of the discs.
0345803485|1.0|I have to agree with everything said by below. I bought the trilogy and wish to h$%^%ll I could get a refund and delete it from my Kindle where its taking up space. The main character is written as if she was 13.  Lip chewing, blushing, heating up, etc are all over done and unbelievable no less than the male character who is really an over achiever. I am surprised that this whole thing was ever published.  If you like fantasy save your money and buy Azimov's books in second hand book shops.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|Yes. it is a clone of the old Mario games, but a very good one. It doesn't pretend to be anything else. It is fun to play and brings back great memories. Wish there were more of the old school games. If Mario were available, I 'd buy it for my Fire.
B007RRFUHM|2.0|You know her from the excellent, but overplayed Gotye song Somebody That I Used to Know. She's the featured voice coming in the last half of the song. I'm in a rut with female vocal releases in the last year or so- the sole exception being the excellent Garbage CD. I'm not thrilled by this one either. I was expecting it to be more progressive, not so safe. I was expecting it to be more alternative, not so urban pop. She has a slightly above-mediocre voice which is fine but she, too often, attempts notes she has no business attempting.<br />The songs get somewhat repetitive sounding. I'm in my 7th listen. Some of the songs have grown on me, several more, I skip. I should have listened to it before I bought it. If I had, I would have only bought MP3 versions of the songs I like. The Target-exclusive deluxe version was 10 bucks. I would have spent less than 5 if I had.<br />She needs more edge. I want her to be cool, not borderline boring. I really think she might have it in her. She needs to find the right producer to let it out.
0143118757|5.0|The premise of Getting to Yes is relatively simple; in essence the traditional view of negotiation (as a game of \\"give and take\\" between parties) is largely unproductive and can shatter working relationships between parties. Under this traditional view, parties are forced to choose between hardline negotiations (where you attempt to force your desired outcome) and softline negotiation (where you make extreme concessions in order to preserve the relationship). The authors offer a new outlook (referred to as \\"principled negotiation\\") where all parties work to make objective and rational statements about their desired outcomes (including providing empirical reasoning for their desired outcome). This new approach (summarized in the Appendix) removes the oppositional/adversarial outlook of negotiation and works to find creative solutions which satisfy the needs of all parties involved.<br /><br />The model proposed is easy to use. The first step involves detaching personal politics from negotiation. Through making the negotiation about the issue at hand, the authors claim that relationships are more likely to be preserved regardless of the outcome of the negotiation. A major element of removing personal politics from the negotiation is to focus on personal interest rather than a hard position. Expressing personal interest in more lucid terms rather than abbreviated and absolute terms (e.g. \\"I would like to be able to sell the house and have a capital gain that would allow me to put 20% on house X\\" rather than \\"I would like to get $160,000 for the house\\") allows both parties to understand the interest at play and to work to explore mutually beneficial outcomes. In addition to expressing personal interests, the authors also insist that the terms of the negotiation be expressed in objective terms (i.e. when negotiating the house price an offer would be based off of the same quantitative/qualitative comparisons used in an appraisal). Instead of throwing out arbitrary figures in order to whittle a party up or down, each party must justify their request with some particular objective fact.<br /><br />As the authors conclude the book, they provide a set of \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" that they've received since publishing the first edition of the text. Each of the questions delve into more specific detail regarding how to employ the techniques in situations where power imbalances may be at place or one party simply refuses to negotiate.<br /><br />Overall, the authors use the bulk of the text to compare and contrast traditional negotiation styles with their proposed \\"principled\\" negotiation technique.in order to whittle a party up or down, each party must justify their request with some particular objective fact.<br /><br />As the authors conclude the book, they provide a set of \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" that they've received since publishing the first edition of the text.

B005LAII0I|2.0|Seriously. That's the ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars. My boys, aged 6 and 8, laughed and giggled through most of this film while their Father and myself felt like we were being labotimized...forcibly...without anethesia. Julia Roberts is SO much better than the acting in this movie, and I am NOT a Julia Roberts fan. Still, when all's said and done, this movie was sex and profanity free (barring a face licking scene that was more gross than perverted), made the kids laugh, and in today's movie climate, that's deserving of at least an extra star.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Not able to read it on my Pandigital e-reader.  The screen will not enlarge it so I can read it.  Won't order any more.
B003Y5H5BA|3.0|This is a great movie. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen since The Hangover. It's really disappointing, though, that they chose to go with the UltraViolet digital copy instead of supporting iTunes. UltraViolet copies can only be streamed, meaning you can't watch them on an airplane or while riding in the backseat of a car. If you're buying the Blu Ray, odds are you want the digital copy for portability reasons, and UltraViolet is useless in that regard. Very disappointing.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Good way to pass the time. Not too hard but entertaining. Story is unique and graphics are pretty good as well
B00881VLCE|4.0|great way to spend a little bit of free time ..great for kids all of the fun without a mess to pick up and no lost pieces....bonus :r)
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|What's in a name? \\"Tree of Life\\" could have been released as \\"Pinnacle of Pretentiousness,\\" and at least I would have known to skip it. The previews certainly didn't give me a fair idea what I was about to subject myself to. Had I seen it in a cinema, it would have been the very first movie I'd ever walked out on.<br /><br />Really. It was that bad.<br /><br />Movies should entertain, tell a story, make one think, or any combination of the above. \\"Tree of Life\\" was not entertaining, didn't tell a coherent story, and the only things it made me think were: 1) This would make a great screensaver, 2) It would probably be *fascinating* if marijuana were legal, and 3) I bet the critics adored it. There was only the barest suggestion of a \\"plot,\\" interrupted by tedious, dreamlike sequences punctuated by whispered, non-informative voice-overs. This guy Malick must be the Yoko Ono of movies.<br /><br />People whose self esteem depends on being seen as intellectual should definitely watch it, make up what it was supposed to mean, then parrot that back to everyone else in their glowing 5-star reviews. Oh. I see they're already on top of that.
B0086700CM|3.0|this game likes to freeze and is stupid to all man and women kind.it's more interesting on a andoid or apple

B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Living Things proves that Linkin Park is still alive and well. I think this album took a little from the four previous albums and summed up the growing process and evolution of the band in one CD. The first album was their calling card opener...Meteora was the safe sophomore album. Minutes to Midnight was the album to show they were not just one trick ponies and i enjoyed it very much, to me Minutes to Midnight really showed off Chester's vocals showing that he had range. With A Thousand Suns i thought they were reaching too much, trying too hard, not a fan of A Thousand Suns.<br /><br />Now Living Things keeps everything simple and clean, I'm actually surprised at how great this album is. I can actually hear bits and pieces from the other albums in this one. The beats aren't cluttered or forced, they have an almost relaxed flow to them. I've got to say Hahn is back in this album for sure. An enlightening album indeed for Linkin Park and their fans. Love the elegant beats and vocals. With all this said Living Things does leave a little off, kind of like the calm before the storm, after completely listening to the entire album and taking it all in i'm left wanting the big bang at the end. Maybe this is by design for their next album, but all in all Linkin Park still delivers. Simple and satisfying.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love the graphics! very easy to use and understand. having it free is just an added bonus! this is a very helpful app which takes only seconds to load.

B002GNZ9DC|5.0|Excellent episode! One of my favorites of the season. The first season reminds me of Scooby Doo, because each episode brings a new \\"meteor freak\\" for Clark to defeat or befriend (usually defeat). If you've made it this far in the episodes I hope you keep going, as the first three seasons are the best in my opinion, and this season lays the foundation for the whole series.

B007PVHANM|5.0|This was one of the best documentaries I have seen on Bob Marley's life. I love how it went back to before his childhood and ended after his death. I think it clears up quite a few misconceptions about Marley and even sheds light on his relationship with Rita. The music was wonderful, quite a few songs that weren't previously released. Any true fan of Marley should get this DVD!

0345803485|1.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />Does anyone else want to repeatedly slap these characters while reading this tripe, or is it just me? In the beginning we have this relatively intelligent woman who apparently has lived in a bubble her entire life since she doesn't even seem to be aware what masturbation is.  She meets this completely unrealistic, dark side of Disney \\"hero\\" and completely falls head over heels for him despite the fact that he's an ass.  Unfortunately when she fell head over heels she seems to have suffered some major brain damage.  She proceeds to lose all self-respect, forgets how to feed herself and excuses every bit of terrible behavior from this man because he had a traumatic childhood.  She constantly mistakes his controlling, condescending behavior as \\"love\\".  \\"Oh, he speaks to me and scolds me like I'm a child, but it's because he wants me.  Why would he want me? I'm nothing.\\"  SLAP  \\"I forget how to eat until he reminds me, but then I refuse to eat.  If I gain one ounce on my skinny frame he may think I'm fat and then I'll really have to starve myself\\".  SLAP  \\"I'll go out of my way to piss Mr. Control Freak off.  Oh why are you mad at me Christian??? What did I do??? How can I make it up to you???\\"  SLAP  \\"Oh, instead of trusting me and treating me like an adult he feels the need to go off every time another man so much at looks at me more than 2 seconds.  It must be love.\\"  SLAP SLAP SLAP<br /><br />Add to that the fact that her \\"inner goddess\\" is a moron, her \\"conscience\\" is a sexually repressed librarian.  Now add the fact that the author can't seem to discuss the female anatomy in terms less vague than \\"down there\\" and \\"apex of her thighs\\", yet freely mentions fisting and butt plugs like she's checking off a grocery list.  They have sex so often it's amazing they can get anything else done.  He apparently has the stamina of a horse on Viagra and she can orgasm simply from one touch.  It gets to the point where I get so incredibly bored reading the unrealistic sex scenes that I forget I'm reading \\"erotica\\".<br /><br />Since the books had such huge sales I gave them a chance.  I honestly did.  I had bought all 3 books so I made it through the first two (with much struggling).  I can't even get through the third book because it's so awful.  What a waste.<br /><br />As MANY others have mentioned (and I agree wholeheartedly), if you want to read some decent BDSM erotica check out the Sleeping Beauty series by Anne Rice (under her penname).  Don't waste your time or money on this crap.  I seriously hope young women don't read this and take it to heart.  Having your every moment and interaction with others in life controlled by someone who doesn't trust or truly respect you is not a good relationship.  It isn't love.  Not allowing yourself to have your own identity or being able to care for yourself are not traits to be admired.  This book doesn't turn me on and it makes me pity those who do find it hot.realistic sex scenes that I forget I'm reading \\"erotica\\".<br /><br />Since the books had such huge sales I gave them a chance.

B001G70M6S|4.0|Bought this to try out in a old Polaroid lab camera as a replacement for 667 film.  Works the same and saves us the trip up and down stairs for things we don't need for publication.  Don't know if the sensitivity is the same as 667
B007R41E8O|5.0|It's more than just hidden objects though that's definitely part of it. If you like to problem solve you'll enjoy this game. Well worth 99&cent;!
B007SSEU9O|2.0|Acting is great, but we can assume that with Ms. Streep. The story was not compelling. They do some artsy-fartsy movie stuff with Thatcher talking to her dead husband. This is fine if the rest of the movie is interesting - but it isn't. The politics are not interesting, the characters are not interesting and there is no story of interest to follow. I fell asleep half way through.
1936608898|5.0|I've been following Melissa & Dallas for quite sometime after hearing about from Robb Wolf in 2009. Love their witty articles and tough love guidance. Drove 10+ hours to one of their seminars (Jan 2011) and it did not disappoint!  I had been anxiously awaiting the release of their book and loved every part of it (even the science-y parts!)  I love the cut & dry concept of Food makes you healthier, or not. Grown adults can make their own choices. But when it comes to food, they try to \\"justify\\" what they eat based on working out before, its not that bad, etc.  They don't educate themselves as to why, they just listen to all the news reports and take the medias word for the new \\"breaking news\\".  Eating doesn't have to be a chore, but approaching it that way, sets you up to fail.  On my second time through already with highlighters in hand!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone & everyone wanting to look, feel & perform better.  They lay the foundation for you.<br /><br />Love this book!  Recommending to all my clients, members, friends & family!
B002LVUG3C|3.0|I agree wholeheartedly with Berry's assessment that \\"The music itself is an acquired taste. Not quite the Sixties pop of his debut or the Seventies rock brilliance of \\"Ziggy\\" and \\"Hunky Dory\\" which was just around the corner, it's a man finding his artistic feet...\\" Bowie's earlier music is just bizzare - and not in a good way. On this album, one can feel his transition into the Hunky Dory period, where he began to develop into one of the best songwriters ever. Still, a few good tracks here.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great way to pass time. Hours of card manipulation. Keeps your brain from going to mush. I recommend it for the true solitaire officianado.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I like puzzle games, and this one is a new one to me. I very much enjoy how it focuses and yet also relaxes my brain. The little musical interludes are a nice touch too!  And the performance of the app has been smooth.

B0015DROBO|4.0|It is a slow start, but picks up speed about a 1/3 of the way and from that point it became a great summer read by the pool.  I cannot wait to dig into the 2nd book.  The character development, especially Lisbeth Salander, is so strong you feel like you know them by the time you read the last page.  As a bonus I enjoyed the insight to daily life in Sweden.
1400069289|4.0|\\"For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice.\\" -- Romans 7:19 (NKJV)<br /><br />This book could have been more aptly titled, \\"How Can I Stop ________ ?\\"<br /><br />The author's purpose seems to be making you more aware of your habitual behaviors, especially the ones that you probably wish you hadn't done just a short time later. Will this book help you to live without regret? No. But it will make you feel better equipped to try.<br /><br />If you have read anything about neuroscience and habits, you are probably already more knowledgeable than you will be after reading The Power of Habit, which seems to be intended for those new to the subject who would like the simplest possible explanation. And it is a very clear and simple explanation. I admire people who can do that. It's beyond my personal skills.<br /><br />So what will you learn? In many diagrams, you will see expressed the concept that when we act on cues (a \\"routine\\") that give us a reward, we form habits of doing the things that got us the reward the last time we acted on the cue. In other words, Pavlov rang the bell when he fed the dogs. After awhile, he could just ring the bell and the dogs would salivate because they associated the bell with food to soon come. Animal training is often based on the same approach, by providing food when a desired behavior occurs.<br /><br />You'll also learn a little about how you can overcome such habits in a brief (too brief, to my taste) appendix:<br /><br />(1)Identify the routine you habitually do.<br />(2)Experiment with different rewards to replace the one you don't want to seek any more.<br />(3)Isolate the cue that triggers the routine.<br />(4)Have a plan to act differently.<br /><br />As a simple example, if you stuff yourself full of ice cream at night, you would need to find a reward that you like better than ice cream (That will be a challenge, but you'll eventually find one.). If a trip to the refrigerator normally triggers the ice cream eating, you might have a plan that kept you out of the kitchen at night while you were occupied with something you really love doing in a different part of your home (such as painting with water colors in a workroom).<br /><br />You'll learn a bit of the neurology behind these observations in Part One about individual habits. Keep in mind that the old habit is still in your brain and nervous system. You can only overcome it with a new, stronger habit. Key examples involve how people became consistent at brushing their teeth and how Febreze found a way to attract customers by building on observations of a little ritual people do while cleaning.<br /><br />Part Two explores organizational change with an example from Alcoa of using safety to lead people to rethink their work habits, a training example from Starbucks, how horrible medical results led Rhode Island Hospital to improve protocols, and ways that Target uses data-mined information about its customers to entice them to spend more money.<br /><br />Part Three looks at social habits and makes an unusual argument for why the Montgomery bus boycott worked. I wasn't sure that I completely agreed with the analysis, but it's the best example in the book. There's also a brief look at how Saddleback Church uses small groups to encourage its congregants.<br /><br />The final chapter of this part looks at when we can operate with free will and when we probably can't. The argument is that if we are awake we are able to make choices. Now, there's a big surprise! The chapter distinguishes between compulsive gambling and sleepwalking. Hmmm.<br /><br />What's the book's biggest weakness? Mr. Duhigg has tunnel vision. Everything fits neatly into his nonfiction thesis. Not! So take what you read with at least a few grains of salt.<br /><br />The book's biggest potential strength is in providing you with encouragement that you may be able to get rid of some pesky habits that you've struggled with forsome time. Good luck!some time. Good luck!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Super fun seek and find! I got itfor free and was totally pleased-i was able to play the entire game for FREE! Played on my kindle fire and had no trouble; the pinch and zoom option was great (and a. must). Plenty of hints on the boards, but not really necessary if you really want to find the items (I ended the game with over 100). There were also a few minigames mixed in. I was asked to log into facebook for something but chose not to and was able to continue playing with no problems. Fun!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|So when I bought this book one night, I just casually sat down and started reading it. Before I knew it, I couldn't put it down and I ended up going to bed around 3 am after reading through 40-50% of it. The next night I finished it, and it hurt. I loved this book so much. Abby and Travis's story was so captivating, and the whole time I was reading, all's I wanted to know what what happened next. Whatever you do, don't sit down and read this within a 24 hour window. This book is too good for that.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Ever since those 2006 photos of the TRUE surviving Beach Boys - Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston and David Marks- atop the Capitol Records Tower receiving plaques for the 40th Anniversary of Pet Sounds, I use to wonder... \\"could it ever be? Could they ever put aside their differences and re-unite?\\"<br />Then Brian's \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\" came out in 2008. This is a record I love and listen to a lot; But in the back of my mind, I couldn't help wonder, is THIS what a contemporary Beach Boys record (helmed by Brian Wilson) would sound like??<br />Well now we know. TWGMTR is a beautifully balanced record that touches on fun, whimsey, nostalga and contemporary contemplativeness...<br /><br />Functioning almost as a curtain-raiser, the opening \\"Think About the Days\\" touches wordlessly on that above-mentioned contemplative note, before launching full-force into the Title Cut, which lets all of us - young or old, faithful follower or casual fan - know that the Beach Boys are back. Lyric-wise, it's a little lite; however, with all their trademark vocal and production values brought to fore, they make it work; and the velvety full-force assult of the chorus washes over you again and again.<br />\\"Isn't It Time\\" is an up-beat, hook laden, funky jaunt with just a tip-of-the-hat to \\"Do It Again\\"... All of the Guys get a turn on this one and it's fun to pick out who's who.<br />Good times (and a subtle declaration of their reunion) continue with \\"Spring Vacation\\".<br />\\"The Private Life of Bill & Sue\\", takes a whimsical time out for some comments over the state of our current pop culture... or lack there-of; This thing cracks me up every time I hear it. (I LOVE the little news announcement at the end - this track feels like it could have sat comfortably on the previously-mentioned \\"Lucky Old Sun\\" LP).<br />\\"Shelter\\" is a beautiful, wistful reflection on nurturing, and a longing for togetherness with that special someone...<br />OK, now it took me a while to cometo this realitization, but Mike Love's \\"Daybreak Over the Ocean\\" is kind of HIS version of \\"Shelter\\" - Not that he sat down and wrote this right after the former was recorded (I think I read somewhere that this might have been intended for his possible second solo LP), but in many ways, this is Mike's parallel of what Brian just said in the previous track; And they contrast and play off each other beautifully.<br />\\"Beaches in Mind\\" is one final lighthearted look at a carefree time...<br />But it's on the last four tracks that this album REALLY delivers the emotional goods. I'd strongly suggest you carve out some quiet time to truly listen to this beautiful, contemplative suite of music, and possibly read the lyrics as it plays.<br />Track 9, \\"Strange World\\" finds our Hero, Brian Wilson, on a bench at Santa Monica Beach Pier watching the world go by... Bemused by what he sees, and whimsically admitting he's doing his best to get on. This segueways into Al Jardine's evergreen lead vocal on the beautiful \\"From There To Back Again\\", where we're asked not to forget the faith and optimism of our youth as we face our aging years.<br />The whistling bridge of music at this track's end (which is SO Brian Wilson) brings us to \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\", with Wilson admitting - with no trace of apologies - that he's getting on...<br />But it's the haunting, evocative \\"Summer's Gone\\" that really puts the emotional hook in you...<br />We're with Brian on a metaphorical, sun-kissed beach at twilite, as he contemplates his own life (and the life of his generation) in the face of the limited number of days that he (and we) have left. It's here that he's gently helped us come to realize that there isn't really an endless summer, and that ALL things must come to an end...<br />After reading some of these other reviews, I see I wasn't the only one who had tears streaming down my face as I played this, and it's still hard for me not to tear up - as he has made me consider all MY days onearth, as well as his own amazing up and down life.<br />If you can listen to these pieces of music unmoved, you seriously need to have your emotions checked.<br /><br />I've heard it said, \\"you know your life is over when you've exchanged dreams for regrets\\"...<br />We can be glad Brian Wilson is still dreaming thoughtful, beautiful dreams, and that he's invited us to dream along with he and the \\"Boys\\"...<br />TWGMTR is an amazing record by mature men that touchstones the past, while looking unflinchingly at the future. This doesn't have to be the end; But if it is, it's a definitive statment and a fitting coda that few other groups of their time & era could even dream of achieving.<br /><br />P.S.: In regards to the self-destructive passing of SO many in the music industry over the years, how come NOBODY gives Mr. Wilson credit for facing up to his demons, coming out the other side of the valley, and entering into what might arguably be the renaissance of his career?
0345410025|5.0|Trust me; if you never buy another book, THIS book will change your life, specifically increasing your brain's health. I saw Harry L on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show in 1970. I had just finished my first semester at LSU. I had a 2.0. After seeing him name the members of the audience after having had them introduce themselves one at a time as they entered the auditorium before the show's taping, I was captivated. Then, after hearing his story, I went the next morning and bought this book. I never made below a B again in any college course. Also...believe it or not, I never studied again after reading his book. I got my Bachelors Degree with a 3.8. A few years later, I got my Masters with a 4.0. I taught high school for years and this book was part of my lesson plans. Countless young people benefited from this book. You CAN NOT go wrong with this book. Buy it...buy it NOW.
0099579936|1.0|First of all, I didn't know that Twilight fandom AU fanfiction got published.<br />Also, would love to point out the fact that Grey pointed Ana to Wikipedia (of ALL sites) for research on BDSM.<br />This book got me through hours in an airport and more on a plane, barely. And now, it's going into the bay.<br /><br />What a waste.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|I loved the movie Real Steel, it is definately a movie to watch and watching in on a Kindle Fire is AWESOME!!!! The price of renting a movie on Amazon with a Kindle Fire account bets the price of going to the movie theater.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|What if, what if, what if...<br />As noted in a previous review of 2004's \\"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE\\", if this doesn't sound like anything we've ever heard today, you've REALLY got to wonder how it would have been received by 1967 ears.<br />One thing's for sure, the response wouldn't have been luke-warm; This would have either been a massive belly-flop, or taken it's place up on the shelf along side \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" & \\"Tommy\\". More on that later...<br /><br />For the moment, though, if you need some hooks or parallel versions just to hang some of your own pop-culture references on, consider this:<br />Even though the Beatles knew nothing about the content or construction of SMiLE, and Wilson had no knowledge of Pepper, there are striking parallels between the two...<br />\\"Windchimes\\" is SMiLE's version of \\"Fixing a Hole\\";<br />\\"Down on the Farm\\" has a similar feel to \\"Good Morning\\";<br />\\"Wonderful\\" is reminisent of \\"She's Leaving Home\\";<br />\\"Cabinessence\\", \\"Surf's Up\\" or even \\"Good Vibrations\\" (yes, in this form) could all be a parallel version of \\"A Day in the Life\\".<br />I WILL postulate THIS as to it's possible \\"if-released\\" 1967 fate:<br />Coming on the heels of the public's joyous embrace of the \\"Good Vibrations\\" single, SMiLE would have probably been received with the same uncertanty as \\"Pet Sounds\\"... UNTIL somebody like Lennon, Dylan or McCartney declaired it great. And THEN it would have gone through the roof.<br />Could this have turned the Beach Boys in an entirely new, unforseen direction? (Especially if they'd have cashed in on their new-found coolness factor and shown up at the '67 Montery Pop Festival?).<br />Again, who knows?<br />In the 1960's, nobody was given the unprecedented leeway the Beatles were. That being said, the Beach Boys were given a pretty wide berth, considering their limiting name. They were allowed to go the folkie route with \\"Sloope John B\\" and triumphed. They were allowed to go the psychedelic route with the previously-mentioned \\"Good Vibrations\\" and succeedly wildly.<br />What you really start to understand, after all the bios & books, was that it was more the internal fractious nature of the band that tore them apart than anything else.<br />We can pretty much guess that brother Dennis would have followed Brian anywhere;<br />Carl & Al were likely somewhere in the middle (with the notion that as long as Brian delivered a world-beater now and then, they'd indulge his idiosyncracies)...<br />...And that leaves Mike Love, who NOBODY ever seems to have anything good to say about.<br />I'm not defending Mr. \\"don't f___ with the formula\\", but you gotta remember, only Brian knew the whole SMiLE thing as something-as-a-completed piece in his head. The others were just singing hunks and chunks and bits and pieces of something they may not have been able to envision as a whole..<br />Add into the mix the pressure from (as they were then) Capitol Records...<br /><br />But hey, after all this, there's the music!<br />Decide for yourself...

B001OQCV6A|1.0|Sherlock Holmes is about using his miraculous brain to solve crimes.  That is his one and only resource.  In this movie, Sherlock Holmes is ripped, can fight anyone, and oh yeah sometimes solves crime.  Would have been a much better movie if the characters names were not Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  Garbage

034580404X|3.0|To be honest, I only read this trilogy because of the hype surrounding it. I wanted to know what the big deal about this book series was all about, and why so many people seemed to love it so much.<br /><br />Since this book was written as Twilight fan fiction, yes. It certainly does live up to that expectation. Pretty much, this series is Twilight - just with no vampires, and a lot of sex. The plot generally follows Twilight's plot. The \\"villains\\" are not exactly the same, but the motivation to destroy or hurt the main characters is. Things end up similarly to the Twilight books. It's not revolutionary or anything new plot wise.<br /><br />I loved Twilight when I read the series. But I took it for what it's worth, as a teen novel series. As a teen series, Twilight is good. But due to the sex in the Fifty Shades trilogy, it's obviously not meant for the teen audience but for the Mom's of the teens reading Twilight.<br /><br />But for the price of the book series, you can get the same thrills buying a 2.99 or 1.99 romance novel that is equally as well written with better written sex scenes that don't make you cringe.<br /><br />I would only recommend this book to someone who is on a beach vacation where it's raining outside and there's really nothing else entertaining to do and the books just happen to be there.
B005LAII0I|1.0|This qualifies as THE worst movie adaptation ever. The first few lines are interesting, then it descends to complete 'oh help, when will this be over?'<br />I realized it wouldn't end for a long time so I began clicking 'next scene' until it was over. The final song was pretty good but charging $3.99 for one song is over the top. Not Amazon's fault; Mirror Mirror is just a stupid movie.
1466401885|5.0|I loved this book.  I laughed so hard out loud the members of my family thought I was crazy.  I also cried once but just once.  The only ones that could have left a bad review for this book have no since of humor or romance.  I wish I could find more stories along this line.  If anyone else has my same opinion on this book and know of others similar please let me know.

0345803485|3.0|I know what you're thinking... This is a young adult book blog, you like young adult books, why are you reading/reviewing a very non-young adult book? To be honest, I don't really know why I picked this book  up. I've been in sort of a funk lately. I've had a hard time getting through the YA books I've been reading and so  I picked up Fifty Shades of Grey and dove in, hoping for a change of pace and a renewed vigor for reading.<br /><br />I'm not going to do too much of a synopses for this book. I think one of the big reasons I picked this book up was the fact that I really didn't know what it was about. Sure, I was aware that it was based off of some raunchy Twilight fan fiction and that there were sex contracts and lots of sexy scenes, but other than that, I was completely in the dark. Basically, you need to know that our two main characters, clumsy and innocent  Anastasia and rich and dangerous Christian Grey (hmmm does this sound familiar?) get wrapped up in what becomes a very different and risque relationship. This pairing different from any that they've previously had and both are in a little over their heads.<br /><br />This is one of those books that I can't really make up my mind if I liked to or not. It's been a while since  I've been so into a book that I stay up until 3 am reading. I actually contemplated calling in sick to keep reading, but I think that's just because I became addicted to the story and I have no idea why.<br /><br />One of the really weird things for me was that it's got a very predominant Twilight feel. Now I know sometimes you see similarities to the Twilight theme and I know this story as based off Twilight fan fiction, but this story hits every single plot point: a near accident, the \\"I'm not the guy for you\\", the \\"you dazzle me\\", the \\"I can't hid from my nature and I'm not telling you about my past\\", the \\"lion and the lamb\\" etc. (insert eye roll here). Literally, every plot point in Twilight was reflected in Fifty Shades. I can't say that this made me not like it, but it made it easier for me to not take this book too seriously. I read it with an open mind and a light heart, rather than expecting this to be a masterpiece, I was expecting Bella and Edward... but with bondage. And in all honesty, that's what I got.<br /><br />There were some problems that I did have with the story. It really wasn't well written. I felt that James tending to lean too heavily on the Thesaurus in an effort to make Grey and Ana sound more intelligent and cultured like Bell and Edward. Also, I found the story to be repetitive at times. For example, I'd read a paragraph and then have to check my kindle to make sure that I didn't get bumped back a few chapters... which was a bit confusing and frustrating.<br /><br />The sex was explicit, obviously, and did catch me a little off guard at first as it's not your normal \\"Vanilla\\" that they do. At times, with Grey's background and the sex described, I did feel like I may have been reading Law & Order SVU episodes... where was detectives Stabler and Benson when all of this was happening? I don't love the characters, but they fit with the story and so I deal with their annoying tenancies.<br /><br />All in all, Fifty Shades of Grey is not a book for everyone, but it's a story that I couldn't put down. While it's plot is familiar, you become addicted to their fifty shades of f-ed up relationship. This book has a definite NC-17 rating, I would say anyone under 18 shouldn't pick this book up. Welp... on to book 2.<br /><br />6 out of 10<br /><br />Happy Reading :)<br /><br />Allison<br />[...]t like it, but it made it easier for me to not take this book too seriously.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Unusual for me, but this time around I had no preview of her songs. I intentionally waited until the album was released. With extraordinary machine i listed to the early release songs and was ultimately disappointed in the amount of production in the album. This is all relative because i still like that album, but it doesn't mean nearly as much to me as her first two...<br /><br />So this time around, I listened to the whole album, once through without skipping or fast forwarding. I took it all in. Then I listened again, and then again. And now I'm falling in love with it. I came to love, love Fiona's music with her second album. I went back and listened to her first album and it slowly grew on me, but the song that took the longest was Shadow Boxer. It was so raw and not produced, but then it became my favorite. And that's what this whole album is going to be for me I think.<br /><br />Really a beautiful album with some amazing lyrics. I haven't read them yet, but from what i pick up in the songs i love them.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|*New edit*<br /><br />Below there are MOVIE SPOILERS. This review was written before the release of the actual film, but all content has been proven correct. MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT!!<br /><br />Batman gets crippled by Bane, but he later makes a comeback and retrains himself to be Batman. Gordon (now mayor of Gotham) gets shot but survives also. At first, Selina Kyle (aka Catwoman) is bad, but she eventually becomes Batman's comrade and she actually kills Bane. Lucius Fox lives also. Come to find out, Ra's al Ghul's daughter, Talia al Ghul, and Bane have taken over the League of Shadows and plan to complete Talia's father's plans by destroying Gotham. The reason Talia and Bane are such good friends is because Bane had, years before, aided her in escaping a huge foreign prison. At first, Bane succeeds: he traps the Gotham City Police Force underground in a violent series of explosions; he puts the rich and powerful on a trial which is presided by Jonathan Crane (aka the scarecrow). The US tries to sneak Special Forces into Gotham disguised as workers, but Bane and his men stop them and hang them from a bridge. Then, Batman escapes the prison bane put him in; he returns to Gotham and fights Talia in trying to stop a nuclear-type bomb from destroying the city. He succeeds, but he is apparently killed in the explosion as he pilots the plane away from Gotham. At the end, Gordon sees Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle in a Paris coffee shop.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|This game has terrific graphics that will work hard to give you hours of enjoyment, late nights and eye strain as you work to solve all the puzzles.  The dialogue is more appropriate for kids but can be easily skipped. The mini puzzles are more suited to older kids.

B005NNUKF4|5.0|Some people have complained bitterly about the MP3 download. They say the track changes are horrible. Maybe the issuer has updated it since those reviews because I didn't think the track change edits were bad. Originally, on the album, all the tunes ran together and, well, you have to make cuts somewhere to separate songs. You can hear where they cut but it doesn't sound to me like any notes were lost. I've edited music for MP3 before and you gotta cut somewhere just so you can index the songs. If you want your MP3 to flow perfectly, buy the CD and rip it to one long MP3. This will make it flow perfectly but you'll loose the song indexing. All this being said, I used to listen to this on 8-track; talk about crappy track changes :)

B000001FTD|5.0|Anthrax are a unique thrash metal band.  They were not only heavy and ferociously tight, perhaps the tightest thrash metal band around with the most excellent and highly underrated Benante/Bello rhythm section, they also had a lot of wit, sarcasm and humor in their music that many of their peers couldn't pull off.  Among is Anthrax at their best, and easily pound for pound as good as Metallica's Master of Puppets, Megadeth's Peace Sells or Slayer's Reign In Blood, Among is the one of those bench marks for which all future albums would be measured.  It is my favorite thrash album, with Master of Puppets a close second.  Scott and Danny are the ultimate thrash metal guitar duo and Joey Belladonna has the coolest and most unique voices in thrash.  Nobody sounds like Joey.  The album cover is also one of the most iconic featuring Rev. Kane from Poltergeist II.  I can't think of a bad song on the album. If you've never heard this one, do yourself a favor and pick it up today.
B00116GHMM|1.0|As a sound engineer, I was excited about the prospect of this on vinyl.  Never have I heard such a bad record.  The MP3, streaming on Spotify, blows this vynil away in terms of quality.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR CASH.  I'm considering following up with insound to get my $$ back.

1936608898|5.0|I'm going to make this short and sweet. This book will take you a few nights to read, and I literally suggest it to EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the world. I can think of plenty of things you should STOP doing and instead, pick this up and start reading.<br /><br />Instead of constantly feeling guilty after a meal or a night out, READ THIS.<br />Instead of logging lots of cardio at the gym this week, READ THIS.<br />Instead of staying up late and eating popcorn in front of the TV, READ THIS.<br />Instead of spending 30 minutes searching the web and deciding between Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers, READ THIS.<br />Instead of working out hard as hell then wasting it all with your diet, READ THIS.<br />Instead of rushing off to get your latte fix every morning because you are exhausted and didn't sleep well, READ THIS<br />Instead of trying 23 new diets this year, SIMPLY READ THIS.<br />Instead of going up and down 10 lbs, thinking that a drug is the only way, feeling high then low, having little energy,struggling through your workouts or reading every 'fitness/health/diet' magazine there is....SPEND YOUR TIME READING THIS.<br />Doing the Whole30 changed my life and the way I feel about food forever. As a fitness professional, I simply recommend this book to everyone. At the very least, even if you don't implement ANY of the suggestions in the book...just READ IT. If you are ready to finally understand what is going on in your body and mind, this book will help.<br />Melissa and Dallas (the authors) are smart, witty, funny, supportive and they give you everything you need to be SUCCESSFUL in \\"It starts with food\\".<br /><br />PS It is actually a page-turner, I couldn't put it down - How is that possible with a book on food and nutrition?

B005DR64OQ|2.0|\\"Trespass\\" is a home invasion thriller that is not so much terrible as mediocre. Director Joel Schumacher (\\"Falling Down\\" \\"Time to Kill\\") keeps the ball rolling, and there are some nice twists and turns along the way, but before the film reaches its halfway point, I think most of the viewers would lose interest in what is going on. In other words, we just don't care when we don't know what these characters really want to do, whose motives remain unconvincing throughout. In short, everything in \\"Trespass\\" looks very silly.<br /><br />A diamond dealer Kyle Miller (Nicolas Cage) and his wife Sarah (Nicole Kidman) living in a lavish lakeside house are taken hostage by a group of robbers. The masked criminals think this is an easy job until Kyle refuses to open the safe, even though seeing his wife held at gunpoint. The battle of wits and wills begins.<br /><br />But does it? \\"Trespass\\" starts out pretty good, but quickly becomes generic and predictable, with several familiar plot devices that have been frequently used in this thriller subgenre. To make matters worse, every time characters are given a chance to escape (or do whatever they want), they miss it in an inexplicable way. Expository flashbacks that attempt to add more mysteries just do not work, especially when the main plot about the robbery is uninteresting, not knowing where to go.<br /><br />Realizing that the film's story is not getting any better, I thought the stars Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman would do something to make it better. I was wrong. No charisma, no \\"star power.\\" While Cage overacts, Kidman remains unmemorable. The two Oscar-winning players add nothing to the film that remains mostly unoriginal. So what can I expect?<br /><br />It is not that \\"Trespass\\" is awful. I just don't know why the film had to be made.
030788743X|5.0|A great adventure book on how can we remember the 80's! It glorifies the culture of the lost decade, on movies, musci, videogames and lifestyle. All of this inside a plot that mix MMORPG with a good cast of \\"real\\" characters. Had a lot of fun reading this!
B004T2QZL8|3.0|The game is different...it takes a little getting used to. If you give it time and try to understand it, it can be quite fun...definitely interesting.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|It's OK I guess.  I've played many games but not this search kind.  I get bored with stupid thoughtless word searches and this picture search borders on that level.  The little story helps but it does the same stuff over and over without any real progress. Not stimulating enough for me.
B00782O7NE|4.0|The Artist is about as charming and innocent a movie as you will come across in these 2010s.  It is effective yet simple in this story of a silent film star and the young newcomer he helps, and when his career is wiped off the face of the earth, her star is ascending.  It's sort of a new/old version of A Star Is Born, but without the depressing drama of that 1937/1954/1976 story.  The cast is wonderfully charming, and the quality with which they captured Hollywood of the silent/early sound era is astounding.  (With one small problem, The Jazz Singer was 1927, not 1929.  It seems obvious they said 1929 so they could combine it with the stock market crash that year.)<br /><br />And for classic film fans, no, you are not imagining you are hearing Bernard Herrmann's Love Theme from Vertigo in a lengthy piece near the end of The Artist.  That is it.<br /><br />While I really enjoyed the film, I don't feel it was worthy of the Best Picture Oscar.  I still think that should have gone to another film about the early days of cinema, Hugo.<br /><br />On the video front, I really want to applaud the producers/director for presenting it in the 4:3 format.  It is perfect for the subject matter.  The black and white video is superb, and I am also glad one of the behind-the-scenes shorts talked briefly about how odd choices of color for the clothes were important because they had to look right in black and white.  So many people forget about that when they think colorizing an old blank and white movie is okay.  The colors they add aren't likely what the true colors were used for black and white film.  (Did you know that in the 1950s, George Reeves' Superman costume for the black and white TV episodes was actually gray and brown, not red and blue?)<br /><br />Audio is superb.  You might nt think it important for a silent film, but, in actual fact, it takes on an extra importance.<br /><br />The extras were all enjoyable, though some portions overlap into the others:<br /><br />TheArtist: The Making of An American Romance - excellent behind the scenes documentary<br /><br />Q&A with the Filmmakers and Cast - this was 45 minutes at a special screening.  Though it did drag a bit, Missi Pyle (Galaxy Quest) is a delight and I'd like there to have been more of her in the film.<br /><br />Hollywood As A Character: The Locations of The Artist - this runs obly a few minutes and I would have loved for it to be longer.  I find it fascinating looking at how they took L.A. landmarks and manipulated them into the film's silent era.<br /><br />The Artisans Behind The Artist - Again, too brief a look at the crew who created the look of the film.<br /><br />Bloopers - more, not less, should have been the word here.<br /><br />The only downside I can see to the extras is the lack of a commentary, but considering the language problems the director and leading actor and actress (all being French) would have likely encountered was probably the decision for this.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended purchase.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I unstress with it and get carried away with the time. Either that or I have stop playing in order to charge my Kindle Fire's battery. I love challenges and this is great for that.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I can honestly say I did enjoy it.<br />Now I don't normally like reading this type of book.<br />I normally cringe at explicit scenes.<br />The difference with this book is it was written in<br />an innocent sort of way.<br />If you take out the explicit scenes it's like<br />reading a teenage angst diary.<br />I found it funny, enjoyable and eye opening.<br />I will put the next book on my<br />want to read list.<br />I love the sarcasm and dry humor<br />but I can understand why it won't be everyone's cup of tea.<br />I give it 5 out of 5<br />I love a book that can make me laugh<br />and still have a good story line.<br />Yes I know it isn't really believable!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked this book soooo much that I not only downloaded to my kindle fire, but also ordered it in paperback. This book made me blush, gave me new meaning to hot sex, as well as relationships. I cannot say enough great things about this book. Thanks to my friend Kim, whom suggested the book to me, otherwise I had no interest in reading this book. A deffinate read!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|A fun and racy read...I was able to connect with the characters and enjoyed the mental visulations the author was able to communicate.  Although I have never visited the N/W before, I feel as if I could see the area and the skyline from Christian Grey's apartment and also his parents home.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is great fun, very engrossing and relaxing at the same time.  I found to ne not too difficult, not too easy...just right. Looking forward to more of these!
B007B8EX9I|5.0|I have managed to watch season one and season two in a little under a week. I LOVE IT! Can't wait for season 3. The characters, storyline and setting draw you in and hook you instantly. What a masterpiece. I wish there were more American television shows worthy of such praise.

B005DL9O5S|4.0|This is a very good super-budget collection of CDs. The packaging is a sturdy flip-top box (I will probably reinforce the hinge with clear packaging tape), and heavy glossy cardboard sleeves for each CD.  My set arrived complete with no missing CDs. The track listing of each CD is clearly printed on the sleeve, and there is a CD-ROM with program notes.<br /><br />Be aware that some of the opera recordings are very old. The Maid of Orleans (1946); Queen of Spades (1952); Charodeika (1955); Mazeppa (1952).  I am not an expert on opera so I don't know if these are vintage performances or just very old recordings.<br /><br />The CD-ROM contains 184 pages of notes about the compositions.  There are another 26 pages of the texts (and English translations) of the songs.  There is no libretto for the operas.<br /><br />For a cost per CD of about $1.50, how could you go wrong?

0345803507|5.0|This is the \\"read\\" for women today!  If you are not reading it, why not?!  I can think of a few reason why you would not want to read it, but what the heck!?!  It is a fast read, predictable after the first novel, filled with steamy steamy \\"scenes\\",  The actual story line is very predictable, the author could have made it more of a mystery interlaced with all the steamy sex scenes...but realistically, I think the reason why this book is successful is due to the sex. And a movie?  Not a good idea nor would I want to see a live version of Ana and Christian.
0345803485|1.0|Oh My, I mean really, Oh my, oh my, oh my......No readers, I have not just been whipped (pardon the pun) into a bosom heaving wreck by the size of my partner's \\"impressive length\\". I have in fact, just dragged myself through to the final page of this ludicrous nonsense and found myself almost speechless. Almost...<br /><br />The main character, Christian Grey, is quite obviously deranged. This does not however, deter Ana, who for some inexplicable reason, has spent so long with her head in a book that she has never looked in a mirror and noticed that she is a \\"total babe\\". A \\"total babe\\" who also happens to be a 21 year old virgin. No, Ana, in the space of 3 weeks, falls so crazily in love with \\"Mr Grey\\" that she manages to bypass the whole deranged thing and instead concentrates all her efforts on a) going from virgin to porn star faster than Hussain Bolt off the blocks and b) deciding whether to let him hit her with stuff. As you do.<br /><br />As for Mr Grey, obviously, readers can't be allowed to see him as simply a deranged, manipulative psycho so let's give him smouldering good looks, a few zillion quid to throw around and hey, and this is the clincher, the ability to love art and music (y'know, like Nazis do in the war films). (Note - the bit where he plays the \\"haunting\\" piano piece, semi naked, with his eyes closed actually made me laugh so much that I almost wet myself - in a non-orgasmic way. Check it out....enjoy! ). As if that wasn't enough he also has a personal and financial interest in saving the world from famine. Just that old world peace and cancer to sort out and then hey, job's a good `un. I mean really, how did the world ever shamble along without him? So what made this beautiful, charismatic and talented man so brutal? Could it be a traumatic childhood perhaps? Why, yes I think it could...yaaaaawn....<br /><br />So, the 2 beautiful people come together (Oh my, another pun) and the rest of the book is basically about Ana wondering if she shouldlet him hit her with stuff and then letting him hit her with stuff and Mr Grey wondering if he should stop hitting her with stuff but still hitting her with stuff while she whines on about wanting \\"more\\" love and less of the hitting stuff and he whines on about how he doesn't know how to give \\"more\\" cos he has only ever hit people with stuff.<br /><br />In between these nonsensical blatherings they have lots of sex, which, like piano playing, speaking foreign languages and making zillions of quid, he possesses boundless expertise. Obviously. Luckily, virginal Ana also has her \\"inner Goddess\\" to guide her on the art of sex play and soon becomes an orgasm machine, chucking them out all over the place in a rampant, fevered haze of lust. So much so that she overlooks Mr Grey's general bastardry and bends over nicely for a few beatings. She is also too enraptured to take much notice his incessant stalking, which would have got lesser men arrested. Oh, and his `feeder' tendencies that, if successful, would have surely added a good 10 stone onto Ana's lovely buttocks which in turn would have incurred the cost of a refurb' to the `red room of pain' when his ceiling shackles needed reinforcing. Luckily he can afford it.<br /><br />As many other readers have noted, the writing is appallingly poor and, if you removed the sex bits, would resemble a love struck teenager's diary. It's all been said before so I won't dwell on it. I will just say, if you are looking for erotic fiction, look elsewhere, if you are looking for an unintentionally laugh out loud bit of fluff and nonsense then crack open a bottle, put your feet up and prepare to be amused. Personally I would just say that there goes a day of my life that I will never get back. Oh my!

B007SGM084|2.0|I am not sure just why I bought these books and after reading them I am still not sure.  Hard to believe that a college grad is a virgin in the first place, and even harder to believe that she gets into the kinky life style so easy.  The revenge motive story line is a bit over the top and not well done.<br />The sex is just a bit silly never using common terms for some of the acts committed, just seemed like a little girl with a big dream of love and really naughty lust.  Oh well I have read worse but I can't seem to remember when.  Don't waste your hard earned money on this group.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|I was so eager to read this book but after a few chapters it just became a chore. Like a previous reviewer said he uses 20 words when he could have used one.  It could have been a much shorter book. I think it would have had more of an impact. Could have had more story line concerning the Jamaica trip. The book could have been titled ' Defending Joran ' ( as in Van der Sloot ) ! Too many similarities to that father and son for my taste. The father has his head buried in the sand the whole time. Not a great book. Luckily I got it from the library !

It is OK with some pretty good songs (Political World, Everything Is Broken, Ring Them Bells, Man In The Long Black Coat) but loses steam in the second half and gets pretty boring.  Disease Of Conceit is a real snoozer - Shooting Star is ok.  If you want something from this Dylan period get Under The Red Sky instead.
1444737090|5.0|I'm a cat person. I've read several books in the last 12 months about how a cat affected someone's life. In my opinion this is the best. It's a good story, well written. The focus is on James' and Bob's relationship with each other which is what *I* think a book like this should be about.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1444737090 A Street Cat Named Bob: How One Man and His Cat Found Hope on the Streets]] tells the story of how a recovering addict was helped in his journey back by an amazing feline with an ability to trust. I particularly liked how Bob brought out James's innate goodness and selflessness. He makes many changes changes in his life to begin to provide Bob with a more stable environment. They become totally bonded, the two musketeers.<br /><br />I highly recommend it you won't be disappointed.

B001BKTEZA|5.0|\\"My whole work drive has been aimed at making people understand each other. . . .\\" --Steinbeck in a 1938 letter<br /><br />After years of suffering through the Great Depression and sweeping devastation caused by `Black Blizzards' during the Dust Bowl era, farmers and share-croppers of the southern plains began an odyssey toward hope and the green valleys of California. This was a time of sweeping social and economic changes. This was a time when banks, powerful land owners, mechanized farming, prejudice and bigotry sent people packing.<br /><br />While working as a journalist in San Francisco, John Steinbeck wrote a series of feature articles about these migrant workers. He developed a powerful respect for their initiative and empathized with their plight. Those articles were the stimulus that drove him to write Grapes of Wrath. A short time after its publication, Grapes of Wrath received the 1939 Book of the Year Award from the American Booksellers Association. In 1940 it won a Pulitzer Prize for Literature.<br /><br />Steinbeck used powerful, lyrical prose while establishing many of the scenes his characters lived in and passed through. He had a gift of writing in the vernacular language of the people of Oklahoma, and the surrounding states. Most chapters were anchored in dialog between the Joad family members and those with whom they had contact. Most of the story centers on protagonist Tom Joad, second son and parolee from an Oklahoma state prison. Ma Joad, the matriarch of the family is the bond that keeps the family together.<br /><br />The first half of the book follows the family along Route 66 from eastern Oklahoma across the state into the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico, Arizona and deserts until they are awed by the beauty of Califonia. Along the way, they experience devastating losses, disappointment, and innumerable hardships. The Joad family meets and bonds with fellow travelers, and experiences generosity by a restaurant cook and waitress. After arriving in California, the family learns harsh realities of life as Okie migrants while camping in one of the infamous Hooverville camps or shanty towns.<br /><br />Steinbeck gives the reader glimpses of the causes and social issues as seen through the eyes of his characters, but he doesn't stop there. At times he breaks up the journey and branches into short narratives that read like prose poems. In these narratives he frequently uses repetition to drive home his message. He hammers on banks. He has little patience for land owners who call the migrants squatters even though they acquired the land earlier though questionable means.<br /><br />He shows us sheriffs, vigilantes and private security officers working as pawns of the powerful. These are the implements of injustice and the source of escalating tensions. They will stop at nothing to quash dissent. Migrants are exploited through the devaluation of their work by these land owners.<br /><br />Grapes of Wrath lives up to its accolades. Be prepared for an emotional ride. Use it as an opportunity to assess your prejudices and preconceived ideas about this trying time in our history. If you haven't read Grapes of Wrath, you need to do so.[[ASIN:B001BKTEZA The Grapes of Wrath]]in California, the family learns harsh realities of life as Okie migrants while camping in one of the infamous Hooverville camps or shanty towns.<br /><br />Steinbeck gives the reader glimpses of the causes and social issues as seen through the eyes of his characters, but he doesn't stop there.

B000002UAI|5.0|The Beatles studio albums can, broadly speaking, be broken into three groups. Some may disagree with these rankings, but I would suggest that is because of bias rather than merit. I'm guilty of that myself: 'Please Please Me' was the first album (by anyone, not just The Beatles) I ever bought so it will always be special to me, even though objectively it isn't one of their best albums. However, I'm basing these rankings on the results of polls over the last 30 years or so, which have consistently split the albums up into these three groups.<br /><br />The three groups are their outstanding albums, the middling albums and the weaker albums. Outstanding are Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, the White album and Abbey Road. The middling group are Please Please Me, With The Beatles, A Hard Day's Night and Help. The weaker albums are Beatles For Sale, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine and Let It Be. Obviously I haven't included compilations and this is the British album list, since that's what The Beatles decided to release (just to forestall comments, I know MMT was not originally released as an album in Britain, but the US version was quickly adopted as the official release).<br /><br />Of this weaker group, only Beatles For Sale was conceived entirely as an album. The others were released to accompany movies and two of them, MMT and YS, weren't written as complete albums at all. Beatles For Sale followed the same formula as With The Beatles; 8 originals, 6 covers, with none of the originals released as singles in Britain (still very unusual in 1964). There are a couple of issues with the album; first, it's one of the few occasions when the band and George Martin got the sequencing wrong. Though the first three songs are good in themselves, they're similar in style and tempo. They'd have been better spread through the album. Also, although they might have been trying to ring the changes, to put the obvious closer, 'Rock and Roll Music', in the middle of side oneand close with the anticlimactic 'Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby' left the listener feeling rather flat when the album was finished.<br /><br />Second, they were running a bit short of covers by then and some of the choices weren't so good. I've mentioned 'Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby', and the other Carl Perkins number, Ringo's 'Honey Don't', was equally not up to par (it's interesting that John sang this on stage and on the radio, so it was evidently given to Ringo just because they wanted to give him something to sing, and his vocal conveys that lack of ownership). Finally, 'Mr. Moonlight' was just an oddity, dredged up from the past and sounding like it. Strangely, they left the powerful 'Leave My Kitten Alone' off the album, and it only saw the light of day on the 'Anthology'. It would have been a much better choice than any of those songs.<br /><br />So why have I given the album 5 stars? It's because The Beatles' weakest albums are still miles ahead of most artists' strongest material. The original songs here, though not necessarily in the right places, are all strong songs and McCartney's cover of Kansas City/Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey! is one of his best. Beatles albums can only be compared with each other; by that standard, this is one of the weaker albums, but, to expand the title of this review, the worst of The Beatles is still among the best pop/rock music ever made.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am a major movie fanatic, however when I saw The Hunger Games Trailer repeatedly come onto my screen I had no intentions of seeing the movie whether less read the book. But I did see the movie and I was taken aback by how great it was. The writing was good, the acting was great, but most of all the plot was phenomenal. So, I had a feeling that the book would have been way better than the movie and I was not disappointed. The book was great

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow... I love this book! I don't usually read books like this, but this one sucked me in from the first page! At first, I had no interest in it. But then I started noticing that it seemed like everyone was reading it. At first I didn't see why everyone was going crazy over it. But all of my friends were giving it rave reviews. I finally decided it was worth trying out, but it was so much more then something to try out! It was so exciting & suspenseful... and I stop here as not to give away anything! Now maybe you'll read it too!

B0007KTBIU|2.0|I bought this version because it had the French language version, and I want my kid to watch Disney in French since we live in the US and he is not exposed to enough French. I was looking forward to hearing the voices and the songs I had liked so much. For each and every Disney movie from that collection that I have bought, none of them has the original French we had back in France. The voices are different and the song lyrics are too! They also happen to be of poor quality which does not help.

B0079XPUOW|3.0|FOR $4.95 OK, for near $10.00, no.<br /><br />Very interesting premise (which I won't discuss) but ultimately it was disappointing. Also, I must take full responsibility for paying full price as I could have down loaded samples, read them, thought it is fun, not fully developed and OK for $4.95 so I have to take full responsibility for the purchase.<br /><br />Having said that Mr Scalzi has to take some responsibility for a not great effort. Fun, funny but in the end the joke is played over and over and over again and in the end it is not that funny. Cute, intriguing, but not up to many of his other books. Should you buy it? My advice is wait until it drops in price, he deserves to be paid as he is an author and he is doing this to make a living.

B005LAJ23A|5.0|WARNING: If you have not seen Seasons 1 & 2... Do NOT read on...<br /><br />I was hesitant in buying this show on Blu-Ray before i had actually seen it, but i managed to get the courage to buy the first season. And i am very glad i did. This show is highly addictive all the way through, for both seasons... But, i bought & watched both on Blu-Ray, unlike Season 1 {which i loved} i loved Season 2, but i thought the ending for the last minute or 2 was a bit of a let down. I thought when Andrea was about to be attacked by a Walker, then someone in a black coat, with 2 armless walkers chained to him was a weird scene, & when Rick tells the group that they were infected all along, & having them all turn against him, was a bit of a let down too. But having said that, this is one of the most highly addictive {dead or undead} shows i have ever watched.
B007SGM084|4.0|Everyone was telling me that I had to read these books so I gave in and read them. The first and second books were AMAZING! I couldnt put them down. The intimate scenes were so hot and I loved the fights in the emails. But by the 3rd book I had a really hard time getting into it. It seemed like every couple of pages they were getting it on and it just got annoying and it seemed like I knew exactly what was coming there was no suspense at all until the end. I was really dissapointed with the ending it was like she just gave up and stopped.But in all they are a good read and I would reccomend them. But I will say that if you want a hot romance novel that is a little more realistic then check out The Marriage Bargain by Jennifer Probst. Much better written and more realistic but just as juicy.

B0081X40HW|5.0|When Haley performed that incredible rendition of \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" on American Idol, I knew that someday I'd be buying her first album.  And I'm so glad that I bought it.  It is very rare for me to love EVERY song on an album, but this is one of them.  She can do so many interesting things with her voice, that I never get tired of listening.<br /><br />At first I was disappointed to learn that the album has four additional songs on it if you buy it from WalMart instead of Amazon.  But it turns out that I don't like the four songs so much, so I don't regret paying the much cheaper price on Amazon.

B000ILYYJE|1.0|None of the original 4.0 quad surround mixes can be found on any of these discs. The surround mixes presented here are new 5.1 remixes and they are extremely crude compared to the originals. Sounds like they just gave it to some intern to knock out. Kind of insulting to the band and fans IMO. The DVDA does include a 24/96 master of the original stereo mixes - but that's it. Pretty hard to get excited about any bonus or extra tracks when the main meat of the release (original surround mixes) turns out to be MIA!

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I really am enjoying the book! Having it on Kindle Fire is awesome, because I can refer to it quickly while I'm taking my rest breaks. I gained 8 pounds of muscle without adding fat to my midsection.  I like the fact that it gives you some choices in lifting routines, but not too many choices. With all of the info on the net, one can get confused and overwhelmed.  This book keeps you in check and disciplined in your workouts. Best of all, Mike's advice keeps you from spending all day in the gym. I get my workout finished in 45-60 minutes (while growing)  and other are in there for 2 or 3 hours (looking the same). Lastly, the author follows up with addendums and supplemental materials!<br /><br />Great Job Mike!

0060873027|2.0|If you've seen my previous Crichton reviews, you know that I *was* a BIG FAN of his books, and work in general ... until his books became repetitive, formulaic thinly-disguised sermons. \\"Micro\\" by Crichton & Richard Preston serves as one final example that the Master had truly lost his way. It was... well... formulaic in the CLASSIC Crichton way:<br /><br />* Cardboard characters with very little definition or back-story, whose main purpose in the story is to either (a) deliver speeches about science, the environment or whatever else Crichton should have written a non-fiction book about but thought a novel was more \\"palatable\\" by the general public, and/or (b) get conveniently killed off one by one by whatever forces in the natural world are out there that we don't understand and can't predict<br /><br />* Sermons on just how violent, unpredictable, uncaring and unfeeling the \\"natural world\\" is, and how we'll never understand it<br /><br />* Lurid descriptions of just how the \\"natural world\\" actually works; the grosser and more stomach-turning, the better<br /><br />* A malevolent mad-scientist central villain who is also a charming sociopath<br /><br />* A police investigation that sputters along in parallel to the main story, then conveniently resolves itself to meet at the denouement<br /><br />* Colorful island-based locales; in this case, Hawaii<br /><br />* One obligatory sex scene, always badly written<br /><br />* Preposterous dialog<br /><br />* Supposedly intelligent characters getting into situations that real, rational people would never get in<br /><br />* A hapless female \\"who should have known better\\" and pays the price<br /><br />* A scientific device that propels the plot (time machine, cloning, or in this case a \\"Tensor Field\\" that can shrink people & machines) but is almost completely forgotten about by the end of the book<br /><br />* The dangers of science run amok with no governmental oversight, except that governments are all corrupt so what'sthe use?<br /><br />* Industrial espionage and needlessly boring discussions of patent fights between warring firms<br /><br />Yup, \\"Micro\\" has all that and more. A complete waste of time, or a \\"perfect airplane read\\" as another Amazon poster put it. And yet ... even though it was a train wreck and I saw everything coming way ahead of time (well, almost anyway) ... I read the whole thing in one day. As in yesterday. All 415 pages in one sitting, just like I did with \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" way back when. I *knew* it was crap, I *knew* I was being manipulated AND preached to at the same time, and yet I couldn't stop turning the pages. As in \\"a real page turner!\\" It was the strangest thing, but I just had to see what happened next, as preposterious as it was. Go figure.<br /><br />And when it was over, I was left with the same feeling you get when you just HAVE to eat junk food, and you do, and it tastes SO good... and then you come down from it. You feel cheap, humiliated, and somewhat violated. (I never drank, so for those who do draw your own hangover comparisons.)<br /><br />Richard Preston, you know better than this. I've loved ALL of your books, fiction and non-fiction alike. I only hope you got a LOT of money for this worthless pile of garbage! And Mr. Crichton? You may have checked out at the perfect time, career-wise, as your best work was MOST definitely behind you (several books before this, as a matter of fact), and this only proved it one more time.<br /><br />\\"Other than that, how did you like the play, Mrs. Lincoln?\\"

B007QZ0LR4|3.0|Not many quartets are given recording dates anymore, and the number that have major-label contracts reaches the vanishing point. EMI/Virgin has stood by the Artemis Quartet, however, through a complete Beethoven cycle, and now the group has moved on to Schubert's last three quartets, where they extend some of the \\"updating\\" techniques that I have decidedly mixed feelings about. The string sections of orchestras tend to employ much more varied vibrato, and sometimes none, in the classical repertoire. I dislike the white, zingy sound this produces, and here it crops up in the striking unison chords that open the Death and the Maiden Quartet. The Artemis go on to lighten the textures and generally diminish the Romantic side of Schubert's music - I am not fond of that, either.<br /><br />Their playing is often subdued and restrained, and yet strong eruptions of accented playing interrupt the calm surface to a disorienting effect.  The pacing gives the impression of tiptoe and stomp.  Most of the virtues I hear are negative: the Artemis isn't clinical, aggressive, or overwrought.  They set an eerie atmosphere in the first movement - is this an attempt to unify it with the slow movement's quotation of an eerie lied?<br /><br />When they arrive at the second movement, the Artemis give a hollow, soulless tinge to the famous Death and the Maiden melody; it's different and arresting. the Scherzo is clean and well delineated. The presto finale shows off their impeccable unanimity in very fast passagework. What brings up comparisons with the Alba Berg Qt. is just this tonal unity, and it's impressive. But nothing here gives a deep sense of enjoyment. It's the fashion to consider Schubert an agonized soul, in reaction to the traditional view that he was a sunny innocent, but surely both are one-sided. Schubert is about joy shadowed with melancholy, and if you erase the joy, you aren't doing full justice to the music.<br /><br />I found a lack of interpretative depth in the Artemis' accounts of the late Beethoven quartets. Schubert doesn't take off from that phase of Beethoven; he's under the sway of the middle quartets, and in his lifelong struggle to rise to Beethoven's level, I think that it's in the string quartet that Schubert incontestably succeeded. Moving on to the Rosamunde Qt., one hears playing that is more tender, especially in the Andante movement where Schubert uses a theme from his Rosamunde incidental music as the basis for a set of variations. The Artemis step into the Scherzo with a return to their hollow, haunted mode. It works, more or less, but it's perilous to leach out the music's exuberance and high spirits. the finale is played like Haydn, which adheres to another fashion for turning our backs on the Romantic revolution in music. I'm reminded that if the Artemis are going to trim down Beethoven, they feel a free hand to do the same to Schubert. Here the first violin's tone is so reduced it becomes squeaky.<br /><br />CD 2 is devoted to Quartet no. 15, the only one to my ears where Schubert really did try to equal a late Beethoven quartet. It's use of tremolos, its jagged sycopations and mysterious, often abrupt harmonic shifts all echo the enigmatic, often unapproachable style that Beethoven adopted from op. 130 onward. So it's a real pity that the Artemis miniaturize this score even more than they do the previous two quartets. The playing is cautious and refined, with little attempt to give free rein to the music's strangeness. Compared with magnificent accounts of the Fifteenth by the Busch and Alban Berg Qt., we aren't in the same league of aspiration or achievement.<br /><br />I've used a lot of words to say that I was rarely engaged by this twofer, and quite often my attention wandered as the playing became fussier and more self-absorbed.  As darlings of The Gramophone, the Artemis will no doubt get Recording of the Month for this new release. That's easy enough to shrug off.is' accounts of the late Beethoven quartets.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|just started pkaying this game. it froze up on me earlier today but the update seems to be working ok.
0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay really is an epic conclusion to one of the best trilogies I can remember reading. These books are wonderful, and thoroughly recommended. I cannot praise them highly enough. The first book in the series is one of the best books I have read.<br /><br />And yet, I give this book four stars, and not five. Taken on its own, I found some problems with this one book. But taken as the conclusion to this series, there is nothing that would make me not recommend them. In particular, the first book was incredibly moving and the story through all three was novel, intelligent and fast paced.<br /><br />My problem with Mockingjay is that Suzanne Collins has attempted to repeat the \\"Hunger Games\\" formula in this book in a setting that does not quite fit it. The \\"seventy sixth hunger games\\" is envisaged in the middle of a revolution, but much of the real action of the revolution takes place away from Katniss. As the book is narrated in the first person, we necessarily skip over huge amounts of detail about battles, rescue missions and the waging of the war.<br /><br />This was a stylistic choice of the author, of course. This book was clearly not meant to be just another account of a rebellion against an oppresive regime. Instead, this was Katniss' story, and fleshing out all those details would just have made the book very very long.<br /><br />When we do see the \\"Hunger Games\\" portion of the book, I felt a little like this was imported so as to keep the theme running. The reason for that section is clear from the author's point of view - making to story fit the series. It is less clear that it really makes sense in the logic of the story.<br /><br />However, the real problem is that ultimately the war felt like it was easily won. We were told a certain mission would be costly (I won't give details to avoid spoilers), but what we were not given was any real feel for the costs involved.<br /><br />And then at the conclusion of the book, something momentous happens, but it appears that no one ever asks Katniss why she acted in the way she chose to act. That did not seem to make sense to me, and again it felt like the big action was taking place off stage and I was left with the piece player.<br /><br />Despite that criticism, I still enjoyed this book very much. It wrapped up the series well. These books are powerful and a little disturbing. They are books to make us think and ponder, and cannot be read without some emotional involvement, and this one was no exception.<br /><br />The story finishes, but you feel like you wish it could have been different - even as you know it really could not have been.<br /><br />Highly recommended series. If you found this review first, you will not regret finding the first book \\"The Hunger Games\\", and reading that.

The tree saplings take a long time to grow though. Overall the good out weighs the bad, I love this game!

0545128285|5.0|This is not a novel, don't expect a novel.<br /><br />It's cute, fun and short, very very short.<br /><br /> I enjoyed it.
1594744769|3.0|This was definitely a book that threw me for a loop.  I bought it because I expected an eerie and strange tale, one that was scary and would creep me out (those are my favorite types of books).  What I got was more of a fantastic mystery.<br /><br />The story revolves around a boy named Jacob and his grandfather.  As Jacob was growing up, his grandfather told him tales of his own childhood growing up around peculiar childhood friends at an orphanage in Wales.  When I say peculiar, I don't mean kids who talk to themselves or pick their scabs or whatever, but rather children who can float and fly and other, well, peculiar things.  Jacob never really believed the tales until his grandfather is brutally murdered and Jacob glimpses a monster responsible.  Yep, a real monster.  When a pychiatrist can't help Jacob cope, Jacob's parents relent to his demands and allow him to go to Wales to settle the matter of the tales and the monster once and for all.<br /><br />Once there, Jacob finds the orphanage, a creepy abandoned building, and almost gives up.  He is becoming convinced his grandfather must have been crazy after all.  And that's when the tale turns really peculiar with flashbacks, flashforwards, monsters, peculiar children and all.  In a strange twist, Jacob something stumbles into the exact world and role of his grandfather.<br /><br />The ending is definitely an opening for another book in a series.<br /><br />I'm not sure how I feel about the story--it was a disappointment in a way because I wanted it to be eerie and scary and it started out that way.  The real pictures in the book add to the feeling and I felt a bit cheated that the book turned out to be so different.  I feel that the advertising and title and cover lends itself to a creepy factor and the book isn't that at all.  As a fantasy, it was creative and interesting but still......just a little peculiar.  All in all, I won't be picking up the sequel.

B003IWRE3I|5.0|. . . me down my own road after seeing it.  That's how I would describe this film to someone who asked my opinion of it.  This is a tough film for me to even talk about to other people because it was a film that went beyond being entertainment.  I'm not sure you can even call this film entertainment.<br /><br />A nameless father and son trudge through a blotted, benighted, dead landscape underneath grey skies and ink black nights brought about by an unnamed apocalyptic event.  All plants and animals have died and nothing grows.  They plod along on the roads pulling a wheeled cart full of their meager foraged supplies (all resources have long gone) with a vague plan of reaching the coast- whereupon they place a baseless hope that things might be better.  Cannibalism is rampant and gangs of men roam the roads hunting for human prey.  All other people are considered killers until proven otherwise.  \\"The world\\" of \\"The Road\\" is the human race in its last gasps- on the verge of extinction.  And \\"The world\\" for this father and son is solely each other and each other alone.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is not a \\"sci-fi\\" film or a post apocalyptic adventure film in the vein of \\"Road Warrior.\\"  This is a fable for the times.<br /><br />This is a movie I'm actually selective about recommending- because it is a film that many people will never get and that some people won't be able to handle or understand.<br /><br />This movie inspired me to read the book which is even more powerful and which I highly recommend.

B0079R8KXG|5.0|I received this kindle fire case through the Amazon Vine program.  It fits my Fire perfectly, and protects it as well as can be expected.

I do not like the blaring red color, but it does its job and I will not need to purchase anything further to protect my Fire.

B006R8GK2Q|3.0|At first the game seemed pretty good and there was some variety in the puzzles. However,  it soon became clear: 1) The plot line was confusing,  2) There were no directions for the mini -games,  3) Some of the searches became boring,  4) Some of the objects were impossible to find except with a clue. All in all,  the game went from fun to drudgery.

B0088XXCZ6|1.0|I noticed that several people credited this album with a wealth of \\"creativity\\". Ummm. Ya. I don't know what album they were listening too. I love Fiona Apple's older stuff, her covers and the handful of duets she's done. This album is about as far from \\"creative\\" as I've seen from her. The material is forced, and frankly, it sounds WAY TOO MUCH like the overrated nonsense that Regina Spektor puts out. The lyrics are incoherent and erratic. The music is jumpy and sharply slammed together with irregular transitions. Her voice sounds like she's got a 2 pack a day habit. The track, \\"Regret\\", sounded like it had promise, until it hit the chorus, after which I have no idea where she was going with it. I am sadly disappointed in this album. I love her as an artist, but I gotta say, this album is WAY off target.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Like many, I wanted to see what the fuss is about.  With that said, I quickly was enveloped into the tale and read all three books.  As far as erotica goes, it is rather mild and simplistic of a view.  It is, in effect, a young woman's fantasy... A man who is gorgeous, strong, powerful, brilliant, wealthy and accomplished who becomes enthralled with a naive intern who is broke and inexperienced.<br /><br />Great literature, this clearly isn't.  The writing is simplistic at best, and poor at its worst.  Oh, where was a decent editor to at least catch the misuse of 'real' as an adverb?  Think Harlequin romance with a small touch of kink.  There is very little here that will offend, and it is written with euphamisms to avoid the blushes that Ana is prone to.  A delightful premise, but poorly executed.  Read and enjoy, but don't expect much.  I will say that the romantic scenes are pleasantly hot, and the characters are attractive, particularly Christian Grey.  But I wish there had been a decent editor to improve the generic writing of the book.<br /><br />Sylvia Day's books are better written, in my opinion, and although her characters are quite as attractive (Christian Grey is quite yummy), her books are just as steamy if not steamier, and more relatable.
B006Z7Z3S6|3.0|Ti West's The Innkeepers (2011) spends most of its time in a small inn, immersing you in a strange reality where the emphasis is on the paranormal.  This slow burn is mostly atmospheric, as not a great deal seems to happen, but if you stick with it, you may be in a receptive frame of mind, for the unsettling conclusion.<br /><br />With a somewhat notorious history, the Yankee Pedlar Inn is about to close.  The establishment is supposedly haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a woman who killed herself in the inn, after being abandoned by her husband.  While the owner is away, employees Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) make up the entire staff for the last few days.  With not much to do, these ghost hunter wannabes pass their time looking for evidence of Madeline's presence.  The inn is nearly empty, with actress turned medium Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis), being one of the final guests.<br /><br />Claire is the more active ghost hunter, and she confides in Rease-Jones after a spooked Luke flees from the inn.  With some psychic ability, Leanne is able to offer some assistance, as she and Claire venture into the basement, where the ghost is supposed to dwell.  Leanne advises Claire that they need to leave immediately.  Claire attempts to clear out the last of the guests, but discovers that he has already checked out.  Back in the lobby, she finds that Luke has returned, but Leanne is now absent.  The end is near, but will they all survive?<br /><br />The Innkeepers moves at a leisurely pace.  Claire and Luke have so little to do, that even providing fresh towels is a major undertaking.  Mostly free to do as they wish, and seemingly fascinated by ghosts and the paranormal, we come to know them as two different varieties of geek.  Claire is hyper, goofy, clumsy, and often behaves like a child.  Luke has a hairdo like Tin Tin, is something of a cynic, and acts like Claire's smartass older brother, although he is actually attracted to her.  Healy and Paxton bring a quirkiness to their roles, which makes them mostly amusing to watch.  Her role as a medium may be something of a clich&eacute;, but even with limited screen time Kelly McGillis manages to bring some credibility to it.<br /><br />With such a substantial buildup, you fully expect a paranormal incident of some kind.  Unfortunately, what occurs may not be quite enough to satisfy.  There are some creepy moments, cheesy jump scares, and decent special effects, but the magnitude of the horror isn't exactly overwhelming, and is sure to have some asking \\"Is that it?\\", when the film is over.<br /><br />Ti West's approach, reminiscent of some traditional 70's ghost stories, may be a fun change of pace for some.  Although rated R, what happens appears to fall well within the PG13 sphere.  The story holds together fairly well until the end, when the bottom falls out, and the door slams shut on the events at the Yankee Pedlar Inn.axton bring a quirkiness to their roles, which makes them mostly amusing to watch.

(Emphasis mine)<br /><br />John Grisham is educated right?! I am dumbfounded.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham, Beti is not a dialect ( what the hell is a tribal dialect anyway??). It is as much a language as French and English are.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|my opinion is the title over all great game but becomes repetitive and very boring but its ok pretty good graphics
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great game, very good graphics. Wish there were some hints for the mini-games within the game. Long enough to be worth the money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game, it is really cool. this is about the only game i play on the kindle. only complaint is that it takes to long to get the other games. the should let you buy the rest of the games anytime you have the money to but them.

I cant give this app enough stars.
0345803485|1.0|One of the worst books I have ever read!  I only bought it because of the SNL skit and the pop culture interest with it; however, I feel I lost IQ points simply by reading it.<br /><br />The writing is poor!  The author must've used her thesaurus constantly (I was annoyed how many times she used the word \\"clamer\\").<br /><br />Character development was poor -- I could've cared less of these sub-moronic characters and truly hope they all \\"clamer\\" back into the hole from which they came.  Anyone who reads the trilogy should have their heads examined.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I never thought I would like a movie that featured Justin Timberlake sexing anyone up.  I was wrong.  This movie is phenomenal.  The director throws viewers right into the film with a whimsical dual scene in which both Timberlake and Kunis portray the rejected partners of separate relationships.  Quickly, the plot develops and it is no quickie.  Character development and relationships feel natural and genuine. This movie will definitely be a trans generational hit despite the unconventional ideas behind it.<br /><br />I am impressed with Timberlake as an actor, performer, and musician.  \\"What do you know about women anyway,\\" is more than Dylan's impression of life.  In this film, Timberlake becomes Dylan.  I could see other actors in the role, but I doubt they could have pulled it off with the same style and memorable charisma.  Of course, his trademark sexuality also makes for a great draw for many.<br /><br />Mila Kunis is incredibly sexy in this too.  She plays the independent professional woman well, but reminds me that there is a little princess deep down inside who wants her romance to be magical.  \\"Why don't they ever make a movie about what happens after the kiss,\\" Jamie wonders.  Kunis's Jamie also defies the stereotypical hero by being just as charismatic, controlling, and heroic as her male counterpart is.<br /><br />Woody Harrelson makes a great-unexpected wise man in this too.  His skewed vision and outrageous portrayal of a metrosexual plays perfectly into the chemistry of the film.  He also contrasts Timberlake's strutting and boasting effectively.  There is definitely no overacting in his work.<br /><br />I also love Jenna Elfman, and her portrayal as the wise sister and alert girlfriend is sensational.  She is genuine, charismatic, and does not upstage either Timberlake or Kunis despite her super-star skills.<br /><br />I would not recommend this for anyone under 18 though.  The content is very sexy, and though it comes clean as a romantic comedy, there is just enough sultry fun to make it adults only.  I am not sure how it rates at the box office, and I am positive America's modern teens dug their teeth into this eyes-wide-open.  Despite that, there is a culture in America of sexual propriety.  Rated R movies are one of the benefits of getting older.<br /><br />The soundtrack for this movie is also incredible.  Songs like Semi Sonic's Closing Time to Kriss Kross's Jump, Jump mark the action with catchy tunes that will conjure up memories of the film for anybody.here is just enough sultry fun to make it adults only.

B00782O7IY|1.0|I can't remember being more disappointed with a movie. I understand the premise, the history of film (having taught film) and know that modern-day audiences require sound where sound is appropriate. Having produced two independent feature films, I also appreciate the enormous value of soundtrack.<br /><br />In the beginning of the film, it is about the silent era. Dialogue cards are appropriate. I get it! But, when they begin screening sound tests of the blonde, the hollow, tin-can quality of the sound track should have been heard. Hollow scratchy voices with echo and weak, minimal sound effects (footsteps, door closes).<br /><br />Sequentially, a natural progression of advancements in technology (phonograph recorded sound to multi-track mono to stereo to 5.1 surround, with Black & white to full Technicolor) lead to the tap-dance numbers at the end. It seems clear to me that THAT was the intention of the filmmaker to begin with.<br /><br />This effort, while noble, fails miserably from a failure to execute the premise technically. I sense that the Director was playing it safe, unable to make decisive editorial progressions of picture & sound at opportune times.<br /><br />Had it been a fresh effort at doing a B&W William Powell/Myrna Loy type of comedy...it had all the elements. The leads were great. The camera loved them. BUT, I needed to hear them. The only excuse for the treatment of the soundtrack (or lack thereof) is that the hum head (soundman) failed to record it, or he degaused the scenes during transfers....and they were lost.<br /><br />Hopefully, the movie was actually shot on Eastman Color negative, with all dialogue scenes recorded with sound and a host of sound effects, waiting on racks in the cutting room to be added at some future release.<br /><br />I will revisit this movie when they remaster the appropriate picture and sound elements. IT CRIES OUT FOR A SPECIAL EDITION--THE BASICS! OH! And please don't forget the dog barks.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|they are back and this is yet again another fantastic album by one of the greatest bands ever and this is worth your money so if you love rush then dont hesitate and just go ahead and buy it trust me you will not regret it
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Generally speaking, I really like this game!  The story had lots of twists and turns and kept me guessing.<br />I removed one star because the hidden objects were repetative and there were no clear directions provided for how to \\"line up the gems\\".  I tried to solve those puzzles, but ended up skipping them.<br />I removed a second star because the dialogue during the last scene was exactly the same as the dialogue in the antique shop (second visit) - but it made no sense.  You never find out who KJ is, and you don't get to open the envelope that you find in Pater's flat (or find out what really happened to him).<br />Quick Tip: You can avoid the facebook prompt by waiting until the turning object moves down to the corner before clicking on your screen.  And what were those turning objects for anyway?  They have no relation to the story.  The highlighted objects should have been what you needed to complete the scene.

B007SGM084|5.0|I wanted to order the first book just to see if it was as good as I had heard but when faced with the option of buying the trilogy, I realized that the price was better than buying each book separately. I have finished the first and I'm half way through the second book. It is very good reading and it does keep you interested in the plot. I have several friends reading it and have to admit that we were all enticed by the eroticism we heard it contained. Now that I'm reading it, I'm more enticed with the portrayal of human duality and how one's past can shape a person. I also think the author has done an excellent job of slowly revealing inner conflict and each character's struggle to deal with their own demons while being supportive of another's struggle. I hope that anyone reading this book can see past the descriptive sex scenes to the actual issues. I just think its pretty fascinating and quite creative. I love this book so far!
B007MDB71O|5.0|I never planned to write reviews for movies with my account, I planned to strictly stick to book reviews only. But I have to admit, I am both heart-warmed and irritated by the reception of this film. Firstly, I hated the fact that it was so poorly marketed and slammed by critics, none of whom clearly took the time to so much as peek at the cliff notes version of Edgar Rice Burroughs classic novels before they rated the movie. I'm willing to bet that before they went and saw it, they weren't even aware there WAS a book, let alone an entire SERIES.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, started as a John Carter book series fan from waaaay back. I still remember my early introduction to it...having my dad open the trunk of his car one morning when dropping me off for school, and thrusting \\"A Princess of Mars\\" into my hands because I had been complaining of having nothing to read for free period. I devoured that book in perhaps one week and was dying for more. We scoured old book stores for other copies (because these books were a lot harder to find then) and I devoured the next book in the original trilogy, \\"The Gods of Mars\\". I went into the theater to see this movie, giddy that one of the things I had read and loved as a child had finally made it to the big screen. My dad, the other Burroughs fan, was more skeptical, particularly of Taylor Kitsch in the title roll. But by the time the movie was a third of the way through, we were both enchanted with and loving the adaptation completely, despite knowing it wasn't completely accurate to the books. It was a perfect channeling of the tone and style of the original Burroughs books in a way that almost any modern audience could understand, while not leaving behind any true fan that happened to be sitting in the theater at that time. We loved the movie, and were chattering about it in the car afterwards.<br /><br />So imagine how surprised I was to hear the acting and the world-building and the casting and costumes and nearly everything panned by critics. Had they forgotten what it was to hear old storytelling? Had they never had to pick up one of the classic books in their life? Did they not remember that, in its purest form, THIS IS PULP, pure and simple and that's one of the things that the true fans love about it? It's not supposed to be some documentary about life on Mars that's 100% believable! Think of how life was in the 20s and what they imagined space travel and life on other planets would be like...think of the things they were writing...apparently, today's critic has forgotten what a good yarn is like and only wants to see hyper-real, 100% believable, non-imaginative entertainment. They have forgotten how great the stories of the past are.<br /><br />How a tale of a single Earth-man endowed with extraordinary powers only thanks to lower gravity can be caught in the middle of two warring races, the humanoid Red and the much more \\"alien\\", four-armed Green men of Mars...and how he can adapt to their cultures and learn to live among them on a world that we still today assume is dead... does it have your attention yet?<br /><br />Now on to the second matter...the heartwarming fan reception I'm glad to see since the film became released for download and on blu-ray. I love seeing comments like \\"John Carter rocks!\\" and five and four star ratings, as I think this movie deserves. I truly believe it to have been an excellent film, and I'm saddened to hear production on the sequel has been halted due to its poor reception. I personally hope that can be turned around, but that's another matter. The point of this review is two-fold: read the books and watch the movie. This is an excellent story. The acting is great, the world is compelling, the story is sweeping, the score is great, and I guarantee you will love the visuals. There's even humor and pretty girls, so it pretty much has it all.

B0079J28NW|5.0|In my opinion,This multi-layered classic is on par with any of the Disney classics.Each frame underscores the legend and iconic status of the Beatles more than any of their other films with the exception of \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".The Mastering for the Blu-ray is exceptional.The colors are brighter and the mix of the sound has never been better.The other superlative factor in enjoying this Blu-ray is the inclusion of \\"Hey Bulldog\\".The one extra I wish was included  in this release was the live footage of the performance of \\"Hey Bulldog\\" that was aired on '20/20'.Nit-picking aside, if this is an example of what to expect from the Beatles film catalog on Blu-ray,bring on the rest--\\"A Hard Day's Night\\",\\"Help!\\",\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\",\\"Let It Be\\" and hopefully,all their promo films.

I watched it on the way to see NGHFB when they played the Riviera in Chicago this past April.  They CRUSHED, and the video helped set the table.  If you have a chance, see them live, and/or check out what's on YouTube (there's a Paris performance of particularly good quality).  Stop reading reviews.  Buy this album.

I had the privilege of seeing this movie during it's theatrical run and have since watched it several times on DVD/Blueray.<br /><br />Let me put it like this:  I love this movie so much that I made a vow to support any film that Tom Hardy plays in from now until the apocalypse.  e.g. I willingly purchased two tickets for, and sat through, This Means War.

B000FC1GJW|3.0|After the huge climax of the story (it lasted 3 books, each of which weren't stand alone) I expected a more action packed ending (there being a war and all). This book is, at most on the same level as the other books.

B006UG90RM|2.0|I am at the perfect VH age... I got my first car at sixteen...my dad had a excellent component home stereo system that he would NEVER let me play kick butt rock-n-roll on HA! So I knew that the only way to have my own killer system was to invest in the best car stereo stuff out in 1977 and listen to pre-recorded cassettes. One of my first I bought was VH I. I was BLOWN AWAY...the incredible vocals of DLR and Mike A.,Eddie the best guitarest since Jimmy Page and Alex's killer drumming. Back in those days after playing a cassette a gillion times the tape would get sucked up in the player never to return intact...I think I bought three copies of VH I. Fast forward to 2012; I heard the glowing reviews. ADKOT rocked as good as the old days...I BELIEVED-until I played it. Well I thought play it a few times and let it sink in. BUT IT GOT WORSE. Yes these are songs that were cut out from old VH albums. The sound is compressed terribly and boy does DLR need M. Anthony. Do yourself a favor and somehow listen to this pile before plunking down your hard earned cash. Bummer.....
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I'm currently in the middle of book 2 on kindle ... so far the story is amazing / interesting plots and characters ... compelling story line. However, kindle readers be warned if you buy the 4-book bundle ... the read seems endless it takes so many page cliks to read just 1% ... it feels kind of frustrating ... but again the story is a good one ... so I keep cliking those pages

B0079R8IYW|4.0|Marware's faux-leather case fits the [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]] perfectly, and is padded enough to provide some falling protection.  Occassionally, like when watching Netflix for an extended period, the case can get a little warm, but it hasn't seemed to affect performance so far.  My only gripe is the foldover stand which, while it works, makes the front cover buckle a little when unfolded.  It's a good choice for the price.
0553584537|5.0|Alone by Lisa Gardner is a page turner that had my attention from the first page all the way to the end.  It's about Bobby, a police sniper who responded to a domestic violence hostage situation and killed the husband who had his finger on the trigger of a gun pointed at his wife, Catherine, and 4-yr-old son, Nathan.  Afterwards, Bobby felt terrible about killing a man and began to doubt himself.  His life got complicated when the man turned out to be a high court judge's son and learned he may be charged with murder! The judge files for custody of his grandson, claiming Catherine is a bad mother who is out to kill him by starving him to death.  Catherine feels alone as she tries to protect her son, Bobby feels alone as he deals with his career problems and chooses to help Catherine when she tells him there was an intruder in her house.<br /><br />This book psychological thriller is filled with suspense, manipulation, murder, family secrets, domestic violence and interesting characters.  I had a hard time putting this one down and recommend it.
B007RE0RR8|4.0|The doll is very cute, and is beautiful like all of the other dolls of Monster High. I have one or two complaints with this particular doll though from the new Dead Tired line. 1.) She doesn't come with the ice cream carton shown in the photo. She comes with a paper magazine instead. Not a big deal, but probably a cheaper route on Mattel's part. One of the best parts of MH are the accessories they come with, so a little disappointing. 2.) I'm used to Draculaura's facial features, and her mold in general. Any big MH fan knows each doll has very unique characteristics to their facial sculpture. When I looked at her in the package for the first time, it didn't look like the usual Draculaura mold to me. Her face is a bit puffier then the other Draculaura dolls. I own other versions of her, and while still being pretty, it's just different, something is off. If you're not familiar with most of the dolls, this won't really matter to the untrained eye. 3.) No stand! Most MH collectors have extra of these, but if you plan on standing her up for display, you'll need to have an extra stand handy. All in all, she is still a gorgeous doll to add to your collection.

B007RE0SCW|5.0|Loving this particular Clawdeen, and probably my favorite of her dolls. She looks exactly like the featured photo too. Her hair is highlighted and soft, her makeup is the best I've seen it. The little paw-shaped compact she comes with opens and closes, and is a really cute touch. Doesn't come with a stand, but I can overlook that.

0470913029|2.0|Although well-intentioned, this book really missed the mark. After reading several paleo and low carb books, I thought I'd read this since so many others used Cordain in their references. That said, I would not recommend this book to anyone that had more than a 6th grade education. I would have thought a PhD would provide a little more substance for their positions and theories to help a critical thinker.<br /><br />This book was really dummied down, almost like an intellectual communicating to a child. If I was grading this work, I'd give it a C minus; because, it was the same thing over and over again. I finished it, but it was really painful. Cordain does not sell his position very well. And, I'm a practitioner of low carb eating.<br /><br />Books I liked, Primal Blueprint, Why We Get Fat, Good Calories Bad Calories and I even liked Rob Wolfe with attitude, book better than Cordain's. In many ways, even the New Evolution book, another non-substance author was more interesting than Cordain's book.<br /><br />Want some meat and the reasons why, author Gary Taubes is awesome.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book pulled me further into the Hunger Game world.[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Hunger Games, Book 2)]] It had surprises and I had a hard time putting it down to tend to my everyday chores. I hated it when the book was done and quickly started reading the third book in the Hunger Games series.. [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay (The Hunger Games, Book 3)]]  I was happy that after I had read the first book Hunger Games in the series. I promptly went to Amazon, and purchased the next two books. Downloaded into my kindle. So I had them handy to keep on reading without interuption.. Amazons low price was very welcome to me and made it so I could afford to do that.. What FUN!!

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. It takes a while to complete all levels - I felt that it was worth the price. I especially liked the option given at various stages of the game to either play or skip many of the 'minigames.' I recommend this game to anyone who is interested in 'hidden object' games.
1475143389|5.0|I LOVED this book.  It's no joke when I say that I probably highlighted a quarter of this book.  I've probably read about 12-15 books on health, nutrition, diet and lifting in the last few years and this is right at the top of my list.  To be honest, it's basically a combination of everything I've read in the past stripped down and all in ONE BOOK.  Mike covers every aspect of achieving a truly spectacular physique.  He covers nutrition, setting goals, lifting, rest and the like, all of which are required to reach your peak performance.<br /><br />The book can lead you one of two ways.. use it to BULK or CUT.  This all really comes down to eating and cardio, depending on which way you want to go. I'm using it to bulk right now.  Only been doing it for about a week but I already feel stronger and at least I LOOK bigger at the gym.  This is coming from someone that's been lifting since the late '90's.  I've never been a big fan of the \\"Big 3\\" lifts but then again, maybe that's why I've never been as big as I'd like.  It looks like that's all changing.<br /><br />His workouts couldn't be simpler.. kind of.  Don't want to get into specifics but they don't take a lot of time, lets just say that.  The one thing that I love is the 5 day split routine.  Again, I've never done a routine like this but I love it because it makes me want to KILL it at the gym everyday, and every rep because I know I won't be working that particular muscle again for 5-7 days.  It really adds motivation to tear your muscle fibers to shreds.<br /><br />Lastly, I want to say that I know some people are skeptical when they see a lot of 4-5 star reviews for a book that doesn't have a TON of reviews.  They think it's \\"some guy\\" that just put a book out and had a \\"list\\" of people go rate his product.  This is absolutely, positively not the case with BLS.<br /><br />People are giving it great ratings because that's what it deserves!  Mike is the real deal and a nice guy.  He has actually already responded to an e-mail I sent.  In addition, I've actually never even given a rating to any other book, ever.  I'm just not that type.  However, that is how great I feel this little nugget of a book is.  Buy it and you will not regret it.

0307949508|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I have re-read the whole trilogy it was so good!<br />I actually had read the books the first time out of order, so reading this one, I had to go back and re-read the 3 in order to get the most out of the entire story. However, they are so well written, you actually don't have to read all 3. The first can stand alone as could the third. But don't miss out on #2!<br />Larsson's heroine is exciting and the entire conspiracy against her begins to unfold. An awesome read!
B003Y5H51K|3.0|Hey, what can I say, its enjoyable (at a certain level).  Its not a really deep picture, but you knew that already. Nice photography and locations and the acting is fine.  You will appreciate it more if you don't compare it to the other classic underwater pictures.  Instead, just sit back and let it wash over you. Pure guilty fun.

Went to customer service and had it refunded and downloaded again to see if that would work...did this THREE times; however, I was never able to get the correct book. Amazon customer service was great in handling the issue and was told that the book will be removed and reviewed to see what the problem is and hopefully in the near future will be able to get the book.

B0080JG2D2|5.0|Steve Hoffman haters aside, I think that every effort is made by Audio Fidelity and its engineers to surpass any previous version ever released of any recording they select. Kevin Gray handled this production, however, and I do not ever need to go back to my mass market version of Nothing's Shocking. This CD blew me away with its warmth, spacious soundstage, and the 3D separation of the drums and instruments. After the third or fourth listen, I can conclude this is indeed fantastic, and the limitations of the original recording have been handled well. No, this is not a victim of the \\"loudness wars\\" so be ready to actually use the volume control.<br /><br />No need to review each track separately, that has been done far too often. Other than a good vinyl pressing, I would be surprised if this gold disc can be bettered with any technology today. My system is not super duper, but the tubes in my Rogue amp and preamp react well with my Marantz transport and Musical Fidelity M1 DAC. I think the cost, at least from Amazon, is worth it. I preordered this, and strongly recommend that interested buyers do that with elite recordings like this to obtain the lowest price possible. These Audio Fidelity CDs are collectible, and like their DCC predecessors, can command outrageous prices on eBay once their limited print runs are sold out. If you truly love music and good sound quality, this is the version to beat.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I was so confused when I started reading this book because of the dates. After the 3rd chapter I started from the beginning just so I had a better understanding of how this was written. Once it clicked, I could not put this down. I read it in two sittings. Very deep with a spooky ending.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I loved this Angry Birds game but was very disappointed that it only had 3 levels.

B00005RIKD|3.0|.... and found myself responding in the same way I do to most of Sting's work: appreciating his talent as a composer, the superb arrangements and musicianship, the great sound/production values.  But this work, like nearly all of it, leaves me cold - like watching a film performance where I never stop thinking about the actor and his career, rather than falling deeply for the character, the role, - or in Sting's case, the musical moment.  It all feel so so calculated.  I so wanted to like this one....
B007SGM084|2.0|I got the trilogy because of all the hype.. I was SO excited, until I really got into it.. I found the plot to be very juvenile, however, the sex scenes are what makes this an adult book.. I also got caught up the unrealistic nature of the whole thing.. 22 year old virgin, wealthy CEO, her multi-climatic response to every single one of their \\"encounters\\" regardless of her \\"soreness\\" as Christian says or her emotional state. As a grown woman, I know the realistic side of great sex, and this book was ridiculous.  It was almost like the script to a porn and lacked any true depth as far as the story goes. Every time I thought the plot was going somewhere, they would have another (very repetitive, and now very boring) sex session.  The plot should be strong and the main focus, and the sex should be the added little sprinkles- this book is completely the opposite to the point that the what should be the steamy sex sessions are so boring you start to skip over them..<br /><br />As a side note, I know that several of you respond that if it was so terrible why did you keep reading on.. To answer that question, I keep hoping the plot would get better or I would have an \\"ah ha\\" moment.. I can say that has not happened.  For all you lonely women / housewives reading this, If you put as much time into your boyfriend / husband as you have in reading this trilogy, you could have way more of your own great sex rather than wasting your time reading this.  How much time have you put in your own relationship lately?

B003INFU2O|5.0|I first heard the edited version of \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" in the early part of 1968.  I heard the album length version a few years later along with Cream's live material--good improvisation played loud.  Anyway this is the album where Felix Pappalardi debuted as their producer and Peter Brown as Jack Bruce's lyricist.  Good blues rock.
B004LWZW88|3.0|I had heard lots about this movie and expected it to be as cute as the Shrek and other animated ones, but it was just OK.  Worth renting, but not worth buying!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I became enthralled with the Song of Ice and Fire series after watching the first season of the Game of Thrones series on HBO.  I'm the type of reader who loves all the little details, so GRRM's POV-centric style suits me just fine.  This fourth book, however, left me feeling exhausted.  I was overwhelmed by all the POVs, and there was no closure to make it all worthwhile.<br /><br />I give this particular book 3 stars because anyone who reads it without having read the first three will not have a good grasp of the overall story plot or may even wonder if there is one.  The series as a whole still intrigues me, but in light of all the riffraff standing in the way of its conclusion, plus the absurd upjumped ebook price of book 5 ($14.99! - not very smart Random House), I'm withholding my custom until the very last book.  Not so hard to do when other reviewers kindly include spoilers.  If the last book also has an upjumped ebook price, well, it'll probably be the review page for me again.  Or perhaps a quick Google search.  Someone always tells.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|This book was a terrific read! If you are not partial to the red room bits - just skip over them - the story is fast paced and lots of fun. You will want to read it in as few sittings as possible I can assure you.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|After watching a send up of the novel on Saturday Night Live I had to read it to see what the buzz was all about.  Well, I thought it would be sexy...but it's not.  It's the most ridiculous premise ever.  A virgin (Yes they exist, I believe in them)meets super rich guy and is entranced.  He wants her to be his submissive (huh?) and convinces her to sign a contract to allow him to dominate her.  What made it incredibly bad for me is the idea that the girl is oh so innocent but gives a world  class bj and swallows on her first try...okay?!  Then she's back to being all innocent and never touched herself sweet.  She actually considers this potential serial killer's proposition after he shows her a torture chamber. They are in Washington State, lot's of forests to hide the body.  Oh and when she has sex the first time she's pleased beyond measure and can't wait to do it again...pure fantasy here as the guy is very unromantic and tells her that he doesn't make love, he likes to (bad word).  What girl, after her teen years of saving herself isn't going to be crushed if this is her first time?  Whatever.  Then he asks her to \\"sign a contract\\" agreeing to his sick proposal.  At $9.99 for a Kindle book I feel ripped off.  I was too scared for this stupid girl to continue and wonder what perverts are out there reading this looking for a submissive innocent girl to hurt.  I like romance and this isn't it.  Amanda Hocking is no great writer but at least she prices her books appropriately.  To think that my romance novel isn't even selling and it's way better than this.  I am depressed.  Buy this if you really believe that young girls need a rich guy to use them, hurt them and teach them that their only value is between their legs.
B004UC4HCG|5.0|good so far.<br /><br />the three heat pipes work well.<br /><br />there is a conduit at the top that lets you run a cable or two from the back to the front.<br /><br />there's some confusion about max memory. in some places it says 32gb max and 16gb max. i guess i'll probably not use more than 16gb considering the max cpu is 95w. which means you really should use an i3 or i5. i7s all start at 95w.<br /><br />the machine is very quiet.<br /><br />i like the way the heat pipe goes directly to the back of the case. the fan and heat sink are mounted at the back. i can see how i can routinely vacuum it without opening up the case.<br /><br />one of the things i did was tape up the side vents and open up the 3.5in bay covers. think of air flow. i like to protect HDDs. they have irreplaceable data. keep it cool and back it up.

B000GCFY0I|1.0|I dont like to write bad reviews, specially since this book has so many good ones, in fact I have to admit that is the reason why I read it untill 11%. The idea is good, but there is no development or explanations. I dont know what the interface ring does or where the parents of the uglies are since they are for sure pretties. Ant then the obvious stuff: uglyville, new pretty town, dullsville, etc. Come on, Im sure a professional writer could do better.<br />Maybe Im tough because Ive read many YA dystopian novels and I can compare this one to those, I dont know,  I just dont like Uglies.

0345803485|2.0|This review is from: Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy (Paperback)<br />everyone's talking about Fifty Shades, heard it on the radio, recommended by friends, saw it on facebook...so i had to give it a try.<br /><br />some of the reviews here are spot on, specially those who had given this book a lower than 3 score.<br /><br />the female character is 21, but the way the author describes everything she does sounded like she's a 15 year old going through puberty still and just experiencing everything for the first time. and then there is this HOT, gorgeous, all-knowing, unpredictable, almost-perfect, jealous, good in bed, sex hungry guy who has the need to control everything around him and has a messed-up past. (which obviously most women deemed it to be the most romantic guy ever)<br /><br />the erotic part, let's just say that they ALWAYS have to do it EVERY TIME they see each other which is ALL THE TIME. and too much of it loses its appeal in the long run. a little spanking here and there, being kinky here and there. showing her the basics and stuff like that. a turn on most definitely but it gets old when they keep having sex 5x in every chapter.<br /><br />and the writing, JEEZ!! it is hard to finish reading the whole book without getting annoyed at the author's redundancy about the character turning crimson, or blushes all the time. it's like she blushes just hearing Christian Grey's name. and the author uses these big words that i have to look up the dictionary a couple of times and suddenly drops down to the level of repeating \\"Jeez\\", \\"Holy Shit\\", \\"Crap\\".<br /><br />I have bought all 3 books at the same time so i am hoping that there is an improvement on the 2nd and 3rd books. seems like there's hope for Christian Grey after all.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is basically Alias.  If you like one, you're going to like the other.  If you've seen one, you won't be too surprised by the other one either!<br /><br />Both shows are JJ Abrams' joints.  Both feature female spy-types operating in male-dominated clandestine government offices.  Both feature quirky/eccentric/bizarre lunatic scientists as supporting characters that keep inventing insane devices that they are somehow able to almost make us believe could be real.  Both shows feature male love interests for the main character that are not exactly whom they appear to be...<br /><br />My 13 year old son and I watched this first season and both enjoyed it immensely.  My son liked it more than me, but he's never seen Alias!  We just ordered season 2 and will soon be watching that one as well.<br /><br />Recommended!
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Excellent special edition of the first season of The Walking Dead. Great quality packing. Comes with a \\"trading card\\" and other inserts. Having had the time to view all of the bonus material, but it does have the first episode in black and white. Like the title of the review states, it is a must have for the true fans of the show.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I had no idea when I installed this that I would like it so much. I won't use any other keyboard now on my phone.
B007R9MFPU|5.0|This is how you make a comeback album. It's like they never left at all. Brilliant. If you've always enjoyed Ultravox's music then you won't be disappointed. This is a dream come true having them back again. BUY IT NOW!!! (Favorite track: \\"Satellite\\")

0312430000|5.0|We often think that healthcare can learn from manufacturing. Here is an example how manufacturing can learn from healthcare and other industries. The book is clever and written in an entertaining accessable style. Gawande has the ability to tell the most horrific surgical case studies in a respectful but lighthearted manner.<br />The concept is simple but but like any change needs careful, inclusive management to make it happen, but the numbers and logic are compelling.<br /><br />I highly recomend this book as an easy way to access a very useful idea<br /><br />I just want to get out there and share this with my team! and start making my own checklists.<br /><br />you may have guessed but I really enjoyed this book and the perspective a self effacing, clever and insightful surgeon can bring to operational excellence - buy or borrow it and read it tomorrow<br />Ben
B005K17RU0|4.0|have had this app for two weeks and have used it a lot.. we live in Florida and every day can be a rainy day.. the info we get is spot on and so helpful in planning our days events. we even check the weather where our families live. the only thing left to say is GET THIS APP!!!
B007SGM084|4.0|Would never read this kind of book normally.  Once you start you can not put it down.  Good read and good for your sex life
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I know people are saying this book is like Twilight, and I can see that in a couple similarities, but other than that it's not like Twilight. I do have to say however, that she does repeat herself a lot, a lot of redundancies, but other than that, it's a pretty addicting book. It's one of those you want to keep reading to find out what happens next.
B00881VLCE|5.0|There are many more free puzzles you can get too.  Great time killer.  Skip the easy level and go straight to the harder ones.
B004QOB8SO|4.0|I really enjoy this new take on Sherlock Holmes. It's extremely well written, acted, and produced.  It translates well from BBC television to American viewership. My only complaint is  that the DVD consists of only three episodes.  That's essentially like paying full movie admission price per TV episode. Considering the shows popularity, it might be a better buy to just watch it on BBC America television.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game. Its really fun and makes the time go by when your bored. So far haven't run into any glitches which is great.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I actually lovedthe book. At times it was cheesy, frustrating, and heartwarming. Who cares!  I was very entertainedand i could not put the book down finished in about three hours.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I love this new album! i got it for christmas last year and have had a blast bumping it in my car! The upbeat parts of the album are just as good as the emotional ballads!
B006YXTRHY|4.0|I liked the first and now the third better then the second.  Just my opinion.  You will have to watch and see for your self.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The writing is repetitive and juvenile in tone. Struggled to get through this awful book. I wish the author had a thesaurus.
0062183591|4.0|Dan Ariely might be the best writer in all of the Behavioral Economics discipline. That's saying a lot considering his peers in the business, Malcolm Gladwell, Jonah Lehrer, and the Freakonomics duo. His ability to take complex information and turn it into an interesting story is mesmerizing. This is made explicit when he writes about things covered in other Behavioral Economics books--namely the ego depletion effect--and does so par excellence.<br /><br />And it must be said that Ariely is a very funny guy. If you are interested in a light-hearted survey of some fascinating topics, read this book.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you are interested in good science or a theory with backbone, carry on. While Ariely can certainly convey scientific themes in a very engaging way, he tends to lose the point as he does. And that means he skews the scientific data, comes to erroneous conclusions, and commits plenty of logical fallacies. The product might be a little frustrating if you're not used to Ariely's style, but can be overlooked in order to appreciate his tales and to get a glimpse of the source science.<br /><br />The central problem with the theory is Ariely's key assumptions about rationality (carried over from [[ASIN:0061353248 Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions]]). Here, he says that cheating, like all human behaviors, is irrational. He says this because, as he points out, people always cheat just a little bit, even when the reward goes up or risk goes down--people cheat the same amount no matter what. His conclusion is that it can't be a logical cost-benefit analysis because if it were people would be cheating all the time.<br /><br />This is bad logic. First of all, Ariely doesn't look at all the factors that one might look at while deciding whether or not to cheat. He just assumes that logical people would cheat more when potential rewards go up. Since this doesn't happen, people must not be logical. He forgets that the risk of cheating is based on the importance of the reward. If there is more money involved, there is more reward, but there is also more risk because people are willing to go to greater lengths to protect that money. And so, it is logical for people to meter their cheating to a degree. By keeping their cheating to small amount, they reserve the excuse of making a mistake or falling between the cracks--they allow for themselves an easy out in case they are caught. And this goes for any size of reward. As long as there is a risk of being caught, the logical thing to do is to skim off the top and not go for the whole trove.<br /><br />Despite the faulty logic, this book is very entertaining and well worth the read. Here's to another fine addition to the Behavioral Economics library.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|Finally got to watch this with the kids the other night and they loved it! As did I, even after all these years. I can't believe that's River Phoenix!
0345803485|1.0|I cannot believe this book is so popular.  I hate the characters and cannot believe that any woman would put up with christian grey.  Do not buy.  It is a huge waste of money.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Thank you ALL for the reviews ( good and bad ) on the new RUSH album Clockwork Angels. I have read ALL the reviews here and I must say I was a little suprised at some of the more negative comments about the CD. Must admit that when I first listened to CA I thought that it was OK. After reading some comments here I started to listen to it over and over and over again and BOOM!!!!! I get it. I think now that this album is one of their best in a very long time. I LOVE the early stuff ( my personal favs are 2112-FAREWELL TO KINGS-HEMISPHERES ) and the latter BUT this album is great. I won't go into the track listings B/C others have already done so. I just wanted to give this album a little time to grow on me and it has. I'm over 50 and have seen rush live since 1975. All I can say is for 3 men who can continue to write and record great music at their age, more power to them. WHAT AN ALBUM.................................
B006LSZECO|3.0|When i first started the book, I really thought Flynn had ripped off the Scott Peterson story. It screamed of Nancy Grace and Scott and Lacey. But then, the deeper I got, the more I realized how not even that true life story could touch the twisted, sick story that Flynn has laid out for us. I loved it...right up until the end, when I thought it waned a little from being truly brilliant. Still a very good read.
B003Y5D776|5.0|worked in stereo for software defined radio as advertised.<br />then on a lark i connected it to my bat detector and it worked there too.<br /><br />great product.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I am Ben's wife Anita Kingsberry<br /><br />I really liked The Forever Girl by Rebecca Hamilton.  I liked the introduction of reincarnation into the story.<br /><br />I liked the interaction between the characters Charles and Sophia. It had a romance and the paranormal in it and I love that.<br /><br />I thought it was a great read and would recommend it to my friends.  I can't wait to read the next book to see what happens<br /><br />next.  I can't wait to read the novella soon to come out too.<br /><br />Anita Kingsberry
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I originally bought the omnibus for this series, given all the HYPE surrounding it.  Less than 25% into the first of the three books, I returned it for a refund, knowing that I'd NEVER get through all three books.  I did buy the first one, though, so that I would feel justified in leaving this negative review.<br /><br />I pretty much agree with the other one-star reviews, in that this book is VERY poorly written, making me wonder exactly how old the author is (fourteen would be my guess).<br /><br />The \\"heroine\\" is ditsy, empty-headed, immature and annoying, what with all of the lip-biting, gushing, blushing, and talking to the \\"little voice\\" in her head she does.  Again, as with so many other lead female characters in books these days, all the guys want her because...um...why, exactly?  Because she falls down a lot and goes, \\"boom?\\"  Puh-lease.<br /><br />If you want a really good idea of what this whole book is like, read this excerpt as an example:  \\"'Hey,' he summons me.  I peek up at him, and his head is cocked to one side.  'Anastasia, you're a very beautiful woman, the whole package. Don't hang your head like you're ashamed.  You have nothing to be ashamed of, and it's a real joy to stand here and gaze at you.' He takes my chin in his hand and tilts my head up to reach his eyes.  They are soft and warm, heated even.\\"  Now, how many, \\"Masters of the Universe\\" (who are also dominant sadists) would look at a naked woman and actually use the words, \\"JOY\\" and \\"GAZE?\\"  He tilts her head to reach his eyes?  That's quite the mental picture....  But there's a bright side -- at least she won't get cold with his heated eyes gazing at her (*rolling my eyes AND shaking my head*).  Like I said, the whole book is like this.<br /><br />I just cannot wrap my head around HOW in the world this series became so popular.  SOMEBODY must have ONE HELL of a marketing team....
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|This record is full of surprises and much more than what I expected from the Offspring. I pre-ordered the Cd and received it the day of the release. Great music, great service.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|In the past few years no artist has spent as much time performing for me as Melody Gardot. I think I have purchased 5 copies of the last CD and given or sent to members of my clan. The artist whose talent Melody reminds me of most in this release,is Tim Buckley's 'Goodbye and Hello'. After getting that LP, it was the one I drove around with and shoved it on their turntables to play it for people.Buckley pushed the envelope on that one,back in the days when you could afford to drive around, and you could put things on their turntables because people did not have to lock the doors. When I brought music no one complained, just listened.<br />I have talked to people on the East Coast, who have heard Melody perform , and they agreee a great talent.<br />And for that reason I am considering purchase of the Deluxe edition, CD/DVD that soon will release. I love Amazon's price protection on new releases and with my Prime I have it delivered and don't have deal with crowds in stores. Trust me vinyl , CD's and music DVD's all have a place, along with SACD's in the California market. Not everyone is satisfied with \\"music in the air\\".<br />If \\"The Absence\\" fails to move you, check your pulse.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really liked this app. great way to pass the time with amazingly pretty pics and lots of them to choose from. very upset now though because it is no longer working. I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it and still not working. to make it worse all the additional puzzles I paid for are now gone. very upset. please fix this app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it and the game that are the game do you like this game love it. it is fun
0307951529|5.0|The people with excuses will fear this book.<br />It's because there are dozens of real life examples of a variety of people earning above averages wages for doing the thing they love.  It's not about working a few hours a week moonlighting on a hobby to earn a couple extra bucks -- these are original and unique careers being created from the hearts and minds of passionate people who decided the \\"normal\\" route wasn't for them.  Valuable information that can be applied to putting your ideas into action, each example is followed by a bulleted list of important takeaways from the chapter.  The bonus content in back stories and forms and checklists available on the companion site are worth the investment alone.  A recommended must-read for any wantrepreneur that truly desires to breakthrough and become an entrepreneur.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Robert Glasper has finally taken Jazz in a new direction. Leaving the listener with something refreshing to think about with new concepts and the new way he aproaches jazz music. I had first heard the Curt Cobain cover Of Smells like teen spirit that is what first peaked my interest in Robert Glasper. What convinced me to buy the album and not just download one song from the album was his colaboration with Lalah Hathaway with cherish. I knew  then just how special this project was.  I give a 5 out of 5 stars. I am definitly a new Robert Glasper fan.
B007JRUA7K|4.0|Much better than what I'd expected, this film isn't just about Marilyn. It is about melancholy, longing and that grand divide between what calls us and what is in our best interest.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is a masterfully crafted book. Its a coming of age story done right that rings strongly of life and the strengths and weaknesses of humanity. Its gritty and tragic and is brought to life so well that you may lose yourself in Vaelin Al Sorna's world for a time, and regret coming back when you leave.
0439023521|5.0|I saw 'The Hunger Games' in theaters, and was impressed by the story. I started reading the book with some trepidation: often a movie has little to do with its source material, and often a book pales after the richer presentation afforded by film.<br /><br />In this case, I'm happy to say that I absolutely loved the Hunger Games, despite seeing the movie first. The two are largely consistent, with the book explaining several events and relationships which I'd been curious about from the film. There's enough new stuff in the book (from the movie watcher's perspective) to make it worth reading.<br /><br />Written in first person, the book grabs you early on. It has gripping matter to work with: the Hunger Games, an annual outdoor competition between 24 teenagers, drafted by a totalitarian government to fight to the death as a lesson to all about the power of the state. And Katniss Everdeen, the prickly yet admirable heroine.<br /><br />The book is a first-person narrative, and Suzanne Collins does an excellent job spinning a compelling story. While labeled as 'young adult fiction,' I daresay this is suitable for any adult. I'm in my 40's and I loved it.<br /><br />Five stars for the Hunger Games!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has nice big buttons. Gets the job done - for free it can't be beat. I just use it for simple stuff,  so I couldn't be happier.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. I might need an intervention! It is probably my favorite game on my Kindle Fire.
B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|So I was one of the few people that loved A Thousand Suns, so if you are looking for a point of view from that end here it is. I thought, and still think, ATS was their best album to date. This definitely had a lot of the sound from ATS as well as everything else they have done. I have been listening to the cd since it came out and it is growing on me more and more. Right now, I would give most of the songs a 5/5. The only reason I give the cd a 4 is because I want to rate it based on how the cd flows from beginning to end. It didn't have that same flow like ATS. It reminded me more of Minutes to Midnight with only one or two transfers from song to song (part of the reason I loved ATS). There is a lot more rap than the last two albums, which I think is a plus.<br /><br />Breakdown of each song:<br />===Lost in the Echo- Definitely reminds me of the first two cds with a hint of ATS<br />===In my Remains- A New Divide mixed with Burn it Down is the best way to put it. Flawless in my opinion.<br />===Burn it Down- I'm sure you've heard it, if not think of New Divide changed for ATS<br />===Lies, Greed, Misery- One of my favorites. Really fun beat, mix Skrillex, Wretches and Kings, and One Step Closer<br />===I'll Be Gone- They not only took stuff they did right from their four LP cd's but even some of Dead by Sunrise starts coming  into the album. Basically, What I've Done, Dead by Sunrise style.<br />===Castle of Glass- People making a lot of noise about this song. Meteora with hints of Minutes to Midnight and some electronic sounds<br />===Victimized- Short and sweet. Has a clip like some of ATS songs had. Heavy metal sound similar to No More Sorrow.<br />===Roads Untraveled- Comes in similar to Irredecent but then adds some MtM.<br />===Skin to Bone- Best way to put it is if you have heard the last two Black eyed peas cds, its that \\"next level shit\\" LP style<br />===Until it Breaks- In the style of ATS where its one style in the beginning but then changes the mood half-way through. First part is When They Come For Me then smoothly changes to Hybrid Theory rap and eventually ends up at calm introduction to a new voice.<br />===Tinfoil- I believe a few people have made this comment before, but this is more of an extended intro to Powerless, similar to Fallout leading into The Catalyst.<br />===Powerless-Reminds me of Leave Out All the Rest but made to fit the style of this cd.<br /><br />Some of the songs moved me the way songs like Numb and Crawling did, which I think is what made them so big and great. They made you feel something. These songs don't fail to do that. Looking at song by song, you can see how they are kind of everywhere, which I think is why it doesn't flow as well as other cds.<br />It has been made clear that they wanted this cd to take the best of all 4 of their other cds, and they accomplished that. That being said, DO NOT go into this cd expecting Hybrid Theory or Minutes to Midnight. Because they took the best of their cds and put them together, they pretty much created a new sound, different from anything they've done but kind of reminding you of what they have done. It kind of gives you a summary of their journey in music, and you can hear the fun they had making it in the songs. Putting the best of all of your songs, you can't expect the greatest songs in the world. There is a lot of room for really making terrible music. However, they managed to merge all of their sounds flawlessly.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE______________<br />If you only liked Hybrid Theory/ Meteora this cd most likely isn't for you. If you loved all of what Linkin Park has done up until this point, you will not regret buying this cd. Even if you didn't like all of their music, if you can go into this with an open mind and no expectations, you will really enjoy this cd.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|I spent a good deal of the time watching with my hands over my eyes. The scenes in the mansion were very creepy. I found Daniel Radcliffe to be a surprise as a grieving father, once I was able to get images of Harry Potter out of my head. It was a very mature choice following the completion of the Harry Potter series and he pulls it off rather well. It reminded me a little of The Ring. I don't want to say how and spoil the ending. Over all, a good, scary movie. This one will be on my list for Halloween movie night.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator-I use it all the time! And it's free! The large buttons are easy to use and you can see a rolling total as you go. I would highly recommend this app!

B006R8GK2Q|1.0|Fairly fun at first, but I soon got tired as it became very predictable! It was a freebie of the day, so thank you for that!  I must have missed some instructions for the mind game of aligning the star lines. I just guessed and eventually figured some of it out. I was very disappointed in the anti climatic ending! If you enjoy hunting for hidden objects in games, this will entertain you.<br />Hint: If you ignore the pop up spy glass after certain chapters, and let it spin off to the bottom right of the screen shot, you can avoid the facebook link!

B007PYEY9M|5.0|My kids absolutely loved this movie! I didn't even remember seeing previews for it when it ws in the movies, so it was a pleasant surprise for us when our boys pick this movie to watch. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!

B005VPRF0M|4.0|My son is 5 and he is a big Lego Batman fan. I purchased this because it was on sale on Amazon and I couldn't pass it up for that price. I didn't expect the Batwing and Joker's helicopter to be as big as it was. It wasn't difficult to put together because most of the pieces were bigger. It is fragile and can break easily but all Legos are like that. Just make sure you keep the instructions and pieces when then break apart so you can put it back together. I usually use a little bit of super glue to hold the fragile pieces that always fall apart together. That way my son will be able to play with it without having to put it back together all the time. Overall, I would highly recommend it if you have a big Batman fan at home.
B0083GR6Y6|2.0|We tried watching this via the Amazon PS3 interface. The sound was terrible. The spoken parts of the movie were so low, I had to turn the volume up to 35 on my TV (normally it's at 14), but when a sound effect or music sequence came up, it shook the walls and made my ears bleed it was so loud. We lasted about 5 minutes having to adjust the volume ever 3 seconds. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if this was the first time it happened, but it wasn't.<br /><br />The consolation I got was that the Amazon rep I talked to immediately refunded our rental price. That's why I will always remain an Amazon customer.<br /><br />Now for the movie itself, it was pretty good. If I would have spent the money to see it in a theater, it would have been so-so. I'm glad I waited, but either way, it was good. It doesn't hurt if you're a Liam Neeson fan.
B0055MITF6|5.0|I recently became interested in outdoor camping, hiking, etc. So these are my first pair of sandals of this type. I don't really know what to expect but I love these! Transaction was smooth, shipped fast, and I love the sandals!
B000000OQF|4.0|The music from this CD was really great.  In my initial impression I thought it was super.  A few tracks seemed to fade out as I got older, but this has more punch to it than most other bands I was listening to.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I've always loved Fiona's soulful voice and poetic lyrics.  I wasn't ecstatic about her last album, Extraordinary Machine, but this one is a major comeback.  It took me about 3 listens through the album to truly appreciate it.  This is not an album that lends itself to pop radio hits, but it is beautiful music that you feel through your whole body.  I'm very partial to the sexy, energetic \\"Hot Knife\\", the seductive \\"Anything We Want\\", and the sweet love song that is \\"Jonathon\\".  As always, her lyrics are poetry coming from the raw emotion of a flawed woman who desperately wants to be loved but sees herself as undeserving. The unique aspect of this album is the interesting percussive backgrounds to all the songs.  Beautiful album and one that I will enjoy over and over again.
B000002INR|3.0|I do enjoy this CD, but it seems the first 5 songs on the CD are the better tracks.  Sweet little sister, 18 and Life, Can't stand the Heartache seem to have a better sound than the remaining 5 songs of the CD, but good attempt.
B0017ANAZO|2.0|the ladies were ok but it def doesnt hold up to the classic and jada smiths acting where she always tries to act 'cool' is so phony to me i'm not sure how she gets movie roles if she wasnt married to Will or maybe her looks, idk. the movie has some ok moments and if you find at a pawn shop for a dollar i would get it but def wouldnt buy it new.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the game I play it every day. its fun. never irritates me in any way. its awesome. its also great price right now. I give it a 100 stars out of 5 stars. I love it
B002ZG9846|4.0|I don't even remember this one hitting the theatres, ppv or the video stores for that matter, but it's all good because Kick-Ass (2010) has filtered down to Netflix, at least in Canada.<br /><br /> Matthew Vaughn (Snatch, X:Men First Class) directed and had a hand in the screenplay for this film that sees a less than average Joe (in this case, 17 year old Dave Lizewski) decide to become a superhero to make the world a safer place and earn himself some respect. This is a stretch for Dave. He's a dork. His friends are dorks. The superhero suit he picks out for himself iscwell, you get the idea. Dave (played by Aaron Johnson) finally takes his act to the street where he is pummelled and caught on tape by spectators who would rather YouTube than help. The video goes viral, and Dave's alter-ego whom he names Kick-Ass, is born.<br /><br />  Dave doesn't know what the hell he is doing, so enter ex-cop Damon Macready (Nicholas Cage) also known as Big Daddy, a man with a score to settle. Big Daddy's side-kick is his eleven year old daughter Mindy Macready (Chloe Grace Moretz) who is a lethal assassin, not a country singer. When Dave gets in over his head with the superhero stuff, their worlds collide and they are forced to lend a helping hand or face death themselves.<br /><br />  The movie is not of the Tobey Maguire/ Spider-Man genre. It is capital V for VIOLENT. It's charm comes somewhat from Dave, but mostly from foul-mouthed Hit-Girl, who winds up stealing the show and is worth the price of admissioncor rentalcor monthly fee. It`s not for everybody, but if you like the darker side of comic world spiced with a few laughs, you`ll like this movie.<br /><br />  This movie gets  ssss

B000YEUUCK|5.0|I HAVE HAD THIS BLU-RAY CONCERT FOR 3 YEARS NOW. WE UPGRADED OUR SYSTEM WITH NEW AMPS, SUBWOOFER, ETC. AND I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD THE SOUND AND VIDEO IS. ABSOLUTELY BREATH TAKING. THIS IS THE ONE WE SHOW TO EVERYONE THAT VISITS. OF COURSE, IT ALWAYS HELPS TO SEE IT ON A 110 INCH SCREEN, BUT THIS IS GOOD ON ANY SIZE SCREEN.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE A 5.1 OR BETTER SYSTEM, DON'T HESITATE BUYING THIS ONE. THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN THIS WOULD BE TO SEE HER LIVE IN CONCERT!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|After their two previous lackluster efforts I was really surprised about how bucking awesome this album was. It's a concept album, but I unfortunately have never been good at following concept albums so I can't honestly comment on the narrative.<br /><br />But on a whole the album is amazing. I don't see it working if you randomly get a track on party shuffle, it's meant to be listened to as a cohesive whole and by gum it works.<br /><br />This review ain't the longest in the world but take my word - Clockwork Angels is great. I wouldn't say it's better than Grace Under Pressure or Moving Pictures (my top two Rush albums), but it is an easy third.<br /><br />EDIT: I accidentally wrote Signals not Grace Under Pressure. Signals is still good though!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|much more fun than I had anticipated the energy thing is a little irritating but I understand that's a big part of the game. great game.
B004XGN8W4|4.0|I really like this product but the only problem is that the case is too big. It will not fit in my backpack (or any other bag) so that I can take it to work(and no one will notice what it is). Otherwise it works well.
B00846REIS|4.0|The book was a great read, the ending for me wasn't what I had expected which was good, but it ended too suddenly with unfinished business from my view.
B00736ZKGS|5.0|Came wrapped in plastic, perfectly new!I thought it was gonna be kind of like Justin Bieber's Never Say Never where it's a concert and his story but it was just the concert so i was a little disapointed... But I love One Direction! It also has a short behind the scenes video and their music videos for WMYB, OT, and GBY.

0143034901|4.0|After reading many wonderful reviews, I decided to make time to read this book. It has every element I enjoy, a Gothic atmosphere, mystery, a bit or romance (though, thankfully, not overpowering) and books.<br />I love stories with other stories intertwined around it, and this book has more than its share. There are layers upon layers of plotlines throughout these pages, making for a deep and fast-paced reading. The whole mood is fabulous. We really feel as if we're there, following Daniel as he tries to find out who Julian Carax is. It was hard to put the book down for this same reason, because we were so enmeshed ourselves in the many stories, that it was hard to find our way out.<br />Although Daniel is the protagonist, Julian is the one who really commands the reader's attention, drawing us into his mysterious and harsh life. Fermin, Daniel's friend, also demands attention, stealing most of the scenes he's in. I do wish, however, that we'd learned a bit more about him, since he is left kind of a shadowy character himself, with a past that's not really made clear.<br />The writing is beautiful, no question about it, but there were a few word choices that I found repeated over and over which got to be, well, repetitive. That aside, this is a wonderful book, one I easily recommend to everyone.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I have no idea why they designed it this way.  I have a pretty average sized head.  The headset is way too tight on my head, and it totally encapsulates my ears and keeps the heat in, causing my ears to burn up.  I have another logitech headset and it gives me similar tightness issues, and pain on the ears.  I think LOGITECH must test these on people with small heads or do little testing at all.<br /><br />Furthermore, the audio sounds like i'm in a echoey room.  I can't figure out how to fix the echo.  I've tried everything.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|I always loved Daria when it was on the air, and now I have the entire series to watch any time I want! Not only that, but Amazon has a really good price, or at least they did when I bought the series... Anyway, if you're a fan of Daria at all, I'd recommend picking this up.
B00846REIS|4.0|Originally posted at Bungalow Books ([...])<br /><br />Initial Thoughts:<br /><br />I was looking for a book that could match up to Fifty Shades after I had completed the trilogy... twice. Did you know there are Fifty Shades support groups out there? For ladies (and men?) who just don't know what to read after it? I happened upon a blog post that linked to a list, and this book was at the top. I thought the cover was strikingly similar to the Fifty Shades book. It was a worth a shot.<br /><br />The Pros:<br /><br />Everyone in this book comes from a tortured past, so the playing field is pretty even.<br /><br />Eva seems like someone I could be friends with in real life. Just girly enough to gossip with but tough enough to do martial arts at a local gym.<br /><br />Gideon annoyed me at first, but he grew on me throughout the book. He was a bit similar to the Christian in Fifty Shades, but different enough to keep me reading.<br /><br />The character of Cary, Eva's best (and gay) friend and roommate, is really interesting. How he changes throughout this book kept me guessing, and I'm still wondering what's going to happen to him in the next book.<br /><br />The New York setting was a welcome change of pace as I've been reading books set in small towns and the Pacific Northwest lately.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />It WAS quite similar to Fifty Shades. The sex scenes were definitely not as graphic but the basic plot line was pretty darn similar at first.<br /><br />I felt like Gideon's character could have been enriched a little. You don't find out much about him. Maybe that's supposed to add to his mysteriousness? I'm not sure. I'm sure we'll find out more in the next book.<br /><br />Eva's mom is a total nut job. I wanted to shake her. Repeatedly.<br /><br />The Wrap Up:<br /><br />I ended up really liking this book after I got past the similarities to Fifty Shades. As the book progressed, the similarities faded. Eva's character is far more likable than Ana in Fifty Shades, at least to me. I like headstrong young women, it gives readers someone to look up to. This is a MUST read if you liked Fifty Shades.<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br /><br />\\"I've only seen you, angel. From the moment you found me, I've seen nothing but you.\\"read if you liked Fifty Shades.    Favorite Quote:    \\"I've only seen you, angel.

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|This movie is one that if you haven't seen it, then try and see it... I bought this as AMC is no longer playing as much John Wayne as they used to and my dad started missing these... these were bought for Christmas so I could finally get rid of the VCR he continues to use... Heck I grew up watching these and I love it... Fav scene... watch for the fight where the \\"horse ran away\\", I love the mud pit action...
B0039TD826|1.0|This is some of the worst money I have spent this year. Only one or two songs that qualified as an actual song. The rest of the CD was slow, twangy, draggy, crap-o-la. It will make a good frisbee--very soon. Avoid this one.
B002JVWR4A|4.0|this is so nice to finally have the 5th season... I watch these while I craft... only down side is that the last disc will not stay put in the holder, as the holder prongs broke... other than that this is so great, there were no problems with the disc, all works well, just had to place in a different holder.... just wish all the seasons used the same methods of holding...
B002RI9PKO|4.0|Those who know the writing of Malcom Gladwell and have come to expect his high standard and thought-provoking insights will not be disappointed by Outliers. Those who will be reading Gladwell for the first time should get ready for an intelligent read that will stretch steroetypical thinking about how high achievers reach their potential. Highly recommended!
B007SGM084|1.0|I bought the entire trilogy as the reviews were promising, but I have stopped reading halfway through as it's the most boring read ever.  There's NO PLOT, it's very repetitive, and every third page contains a lengthy sex scene. The whole 'story' is overly predictable. So disappointing!  DO NOT BUY!
0061743526|5.0|This is a classic and is absoutely a must read. It is a very easy read and you will find yourself finishing it faster than you expected or wanted. PBS recently had a program on Harper Lee on American Masters that is worth your time also.
0307730697|5.0|This can only happen in the wonderful U.S.A. I read alot about the brave men and women who fight for our freedom. I could not put my kindle down. Adam Brown put the demons behind him, with the help of God, and became one of Americas elite warriors. I sure wish the end could have been different for his wife and children. I can only pray for them, and you can tell that is what Adam would want. I read alot. I have never wrote a review before. I just felt compelled. God Bless to his family and friends.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|1 star off for the kindle bundle - the formatting was poorly done compared to other kindle books.  Sure, as a few other reviewers point out - it works, and I read through the entire 4 book bundle without too many issues, but either the bundle was assembled by an inexperienced intern, or they just did a poor job (this is as of 3 March 2012 when I purchased the bundle).<br />That being said, you can definitely read them all, and they sync fine across devices (I used my iPad and iPhone primarily).<br /><br />As far as Martin's work, I loved the books - great story, took some turns I didn't expect and really kept me wondering what would happen next.  Very enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After all the hype about this book I was very disappointed.It is very repetitive and so boring. I was hoping to read all three of the books but the first one was enough for me. I didn't find much of a story line.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great. love it. helpful when checking weather reports.  great app tor checking up on weather. absolutely love it. both me and the wife use it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|the weather channel app is the best. now I can know what I want to wear the next day just by looking at the weather channel app.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I purchased this in the sincere hope that it would work with my Kindle keyboard 3rd gen device.  I had bought a Fire for my wife for Christmas and realized that it was almost identical to my 3rd gen Kindle.  I had previously used the defective pebbled leather cover with the metal hooks that caused the Kindle to not respond, however I enjoyed reading the Kindle without the case anyway so a sleeve better suited my needs.  The sleeve appears well made, and the eggshell cushion provides adequate protection.  If you are looking for a sleeve for a 3rd generation Kindle, look no further.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Its a good game, just got it but so far I like it, fun searching game. No issues, game runs smooth. I have the Droid x2.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This isn't just one of my favorite movies by Wes Anderson, it's one of my favorite movies overall in the comedy genre. I didn't expect it to follow the book, maybe that's why I wasn't disappointed. Expecting a full length movie to follow along with a short childrens book is just ridiculous. Where I thought 'Where the Wild Things Are' failed, 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' excelled. It loosely followed the storyline and Wes Anderson through in his style and brought the characters to life. The comedic parts were typical Wes Anderson and the whole filming style was just incredible. It was a great movie and I highly recommend it.
B002C949KE|5.0|Will reading a favorable Amazon review make you more likely to buy this book? Would an unfavorable review? Is there some combination of positive praise with negative realism that will maximize sales? This is not covered in the book, but it's the kind of research that Dan Ariely does every day. This book reports on his research in a readable style and attempts to inform and warn the reader about the hidden sides of human nature we tend to forget. I read this years ago in print and purchased the digital version for reading in Kindle for iPad. This revised version had some nice current examples, but I think they removed a couple of stories that I remember really liking. The graphics worked well in digital format, but the footnotes seemed to jump around strangely. If you want this as a reference work, I'd recommend the hard copy, but for a casual read the digital was just fine.

Thank you, Billy and the Pumpkins for sharing this with the world.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|I recently purchased the Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware. It absolutely lived up to my expectations! It has a sleek, stylish design that is sophisticated enough for an adult, but simple enough for a child.<br /><br />  Compared to other cases, this case would be highly ranked by me. It has great value that cannot be overlooked. Other similar cases would have come to a total of over $60.00! This case, combined with convenience, versatility, and design is an excellent choice for anyone!<br /><br />  Overall, this case has a very sleek and stylish design. It is well constructed, and I have come to very much appreciate it. I am very convinced that this is an outstanding case. Are you?

B0058EBNAO|5.0|This its by far the best weather app of all available. I've installed and tried them all over the past the years. I've found this to be the prettiest, and most accurate of all. Extended weather detail features are easy to access, once you take the time to familiarize and learn the app. yes, its but quite as simple as some inept users may desire, but if you invest a little time (or maybe intelligence) its an incredibly useful and reliable app. Used on asus transformer, HTC desire, motorola photon/electrify and Samsung galaxy.
B008BIZ06M|3.0|I had lost touch with The Offspring since their third CD in the mid 1990's with the song that brought them into the public eye \\"Come Out And Play\\".  I heard a couple of clips, and I decided to give it a chance.  What I found on the whole was not what I expected.  Five of the songs (\\"The Future Is Now\\", \\"Secrets From The Underground\\", \\"Hurting As One\\", \\"Dividing By Zero\\", and \\"Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing And Rides The Bomb To Hell\\") sounded like what I remembered, but the others made me scratch my head a little.  Here are some of my thoughts on the other songs.<br /><br />\\"Days Go By\\" - This seemed more like something that Nickelback would record with more of a pop sound and rich harmonies.<br /><br />\\"Turning Into You\\" - The use of drum machines made me think of Linkin Park (at least their latest release).<br /><br />\\"Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk)\\" - The verses sound like a bad knockoff of Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.<br /><br />\\"All I Have Left Is You\\" - I thought this was another Nickelback sound-alike.<br /><br />\\"Oc Guns\\" - This one screams Beastie Boys with a dash of Latin spice.  It's kind of interesting taken by itself.<br /><br />\\"Dirty Magic\\" - I thought this sounded like a tamed down version of Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" without the air let out of the chorus.<br /><br />\\"I Wanna Secret Family (With You)\\" - I'm sorry, but this song was just cheesy.<br /><br />There are some good songs on this album, but it someone winds up being less than the sum of its parts.  While you may not agree with the specific comparisons I made, they do hint to the fact that Days Go By is not a very cohesive album.  I would recommend finding the songs you like and buying them individually rather than the whole album - unless the price happens to work out better for the album.<br /><br />Download this:  The Future Is Now
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I discovered Rebecca Hamilton through twitter, as someone had linked to an article she wrote.  I was immediately intrigued by her thoughts on Urban Fantasy and paranormal romance.  Needless to say, I read a few reviews of Hamilton's debut and was immediately intrigued.  Witches?  Voices?  Small town prejudices?  Count me in!  I grabbed the sample for my kindle and was immediately roped into Sophia's world.  I devoured the sample and immediately downloaded the rest of the book.  Hamilton's writes a wonderful tale, bringing in a new look at existing lore.  She elevates the genre by crafting a unique world using ancient and forgotten lore.  Seamlessly weaving history with modern times, this story is a wonderful read:  just enough excitement and romance.  A wonderful setup to what promises to be an interesting series, The Forever Girl is a must-read for fans of LJ Smith and Charlaine Harris.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|Clash of the Titans gave us a modern view of greek mythology filled with beautiful sets and scenery, handsome actors and stunning actresses all wrapped up in amazing special effects and no room for a story. The first film was entertaining enough to warrant a look at the sequel \\"Wrath of the Titans\\" but unfortunately not even Ralph \\"Voldemort\\" Fiennes and Liam \\"Qui-Gon\\" Neeson could save this disaster.<br /><br />First, Io, the lovely Gemma Arterton, is no where to be seen in this film, we are left to assume that Perseus (Sam Worthington) fathered her baby, she dies off screen and he is alone to raise his son. Ares conspires with Hades to sap all of Zeus' energy to release Kronos (the only titan) from Tartarus and bring down humanity and the rest of Olympus. Perseus is called up by both man and god to fight off this evil threat and rescue the world.<br /><br />The movie looks great, Kronos looks massive and menacing just like the titans from God of War 3, Ares is portrayed as the bad guy, once again a plot device from God of War, I think the writers need to brush up on their literature, Ares is the God of War not the God of Deception and Cowardice. Andromeda has become this generation's Zena warrior princess and Perseus looks disinterested in his own adventure. I have to say this but in my review of Clash of the Titans: The Video Game, I mentioned that this series is ripping off the God of War franchise and this movie proves it. A quick Youtube search of God of War gameplay will reveal the \\"source\\" material the writers got their inspiration from and do not even try to hide (similar copy of a lava titan, a shifting puzzle area to overcome,a villianous Ares)<br /><br />Many respected actors make an appearance in this film and at the end when Zeus and Hades take to the battlefield to stop Kronos's forces is short and unfulfilling. After all with today's technology and our unlimited imagination, why cut short the awesome powers Neeson and Fiennes could unleash and keep the ONE titan's fight scene so tedious. The only trick the filmmakers seem to manage is that they keep fooling us to come back to them in the hopes of a better film, they must have graduated from the George Lucas school of film and special effects.<br /><br />It is a good film to enjoy if you do not want to think about a plot or invest yourself in a character or their outcome. Looks great in Blu-ray.

B0058YPG2K|1.0|Let me start by saying I'm an incredibly huge Breaking Bad fan and I've anxiously awaited this Blu-ray edition of the fourth season to come out.  This DVD Is the most frustrating, unexplainable stupid, illogical screw up I've ever seen in my life!  First of all I returned the first set to Amazon because it is the most difficult loading DVD I've ever experienced keeping in mind I have 800 DVDs and at least 150 Blu-ray DVDs and have never had this problem before so I assumed this set was defective.<br /><br />So next Amazon replaces the defective DVDs incredibly fast (thank you Amazon) so now thinking my troubles are over I sit down to watch the Breaking Bad forth season only to find this set has the exact same problem as the previous one.  Now I'm left with the two choices either try to get this set to work somehow or return it and have absolutely nothing!  I decided to try to get this to work I can't even explain what I had to go through as far as starting, stopping, opening, closing the DVD player and after about 10 minutes you're able to get it to play but you have to go through this every single time you change anything on this DVD set.<br /><br />With the fifth season of breaking bad a little over two weeks away I'm trying desperately to watch the fourth season and get caught up and I thought the loading problem would be something I could live with but little did I know that is only where the problems begin!<br /><br />This is a little minor thing but nevertheless incredibly irritating on these three DVDs every single episode is listed on every DVD menu so you do not know which episodes are on  which DVD, so you're always given the option to pick which episode you want to watch only to find out they tell you to get up and change disk..  I for one have never seen a menu situation like this usually 100% of the time the episodes on that disc are the only things listed on that disk.<br /><br />So now you have to get up go make an unexpected disk change only to haveto go through the incredible process of getting the next disc to load.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume my three blu ray DVD players are the only ones that are going to have this loading problem, but here is a problem that there's no way you can escape and it's hard to freakin imagine why they would even do this!  For you Breaking Bad fans out there you realized there's key conversations that go on totally in Spanish so if you can believe this, \\"they do not have the closed captioning on the screen for those conversations\\" so if you don't speak Spanish this is somewhat of a problem!<br /><br />Get a load of this,  it gets worse,  not only did they leave the close captioning off of two incredibly long important conversations but later on in a far less critical conversation they DO have the close captioning, this makes absolutely no sense whatsoever!<br /><br />I have not tried this and don't intend to with the loading issues on this DVD set, I assume I could go in the menu and turn on closed captioning for just those conversations and then turn it off but then having to go through the loading process again no way!<br /><br />I have all three seasons on regular DVD and I have also purchased the first three seasons on Blu-ray and I have not had this type problem with any of those sets, why all of a sudden they decided to just totally screw this thing up is totally amazing to me, the person or persons responsible for this colossal screwup must be fired at once!<br /><br />I'm now going to return this second set and order the regular DVD version, do you think there is anyway they could have screwed that one up too?
B0088TG252|1.0|This is one of the few movies I actually just turned off after about an hour. It's too yawningly predictable and the action is extremely typical and unimaginative. It's just another adrenaline flick with an overly simplistic plot.

B001ANYDAO|5.0|I'd highly recommend this book to...anyone. Everyone.<br /><br />It's a robust and penetrating examination of the factors that go into the superstar success stories we see in our culture. I think the author intended it primarily to shift cultural understanding, but there's a wealth of personal application in it, especially for parents of small children and entrepreneurs.<br /><br />That's because the core of the book is about understanding the source of a competitive edge. As a publishing-revolution success story myself, I could see applications of Gladwell's thesis throughout my experiences in the last two years.<br /><br />It's an important premise and some fascinating data, but it's also a story well told. I'm impressed with the narrative aspect of the book, making it easily accessible and entertaining to read. Check it out!
B003EYVXVY|1.0|Buy this instead:  http://www.amazon.com/Avatar-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Pack/dp/B008XBCJ34/ref=tmm_blu_title_0<br /><br />I bought a $2,500 Panasonic plasma VT50 3DTV in 2012.  Being in the panasonic family should get you a path to owning Avatar 3D?<br /><br />Wrong.  Panasonic has no rhyme or reason of how to get this movie in 3D.  Last month you only need to buy a less than $200 bluray player to get it!  I already had the bluray 3D player!<br /><br />A $2,500 PANASONIC TV doesn't qualify though?<br /><br />Panasonic; are actual intellegent people making the decisions on how to get this Blu-Rya in 3D?<br /><br />Very disappointed and thinking of returning the $2,500 TV.  Maybe if they suffer enough return on high ticket items, they would screw over high ticket purchasers.
0060507772|5.0|The first time I encountered this book, it was as a big, beautiful, glossy picture book illustrated by Jack Kirby. I flipped through it, marveled at the art, got an impression of the storyline, and then forgot all about it.<br /><br />It's labeled as \\"a fable\\" and is essentially a novella, at 40,000 words. I'd essentially put it down as just a vehicle for publishing Kirby's artwork.<br /><br />But now that I'm working my way back through the full series in publication order, I decided to give this one its due and discovered just how much I'd been missing. The story is rich and potent--not a thrown-together plot to fill out some supplemental merchandise, but a finely distilled Discworld story. The book benefits from the brevity. It's probably the strongest of the Cohen/Rincewind novels I've read.<br /><br />And, of course, the illustrations are gorgeous. Well worth reading if you're any fan of Discworld.
B008CT2CV6|1.0|What a horrible sequal.  A hollywood blunder, bad acting, bad plot, no movement. Just Bad!<br />Most of the actors phoned this one in.  They should have put nicholas cage in there too.  Choko, from<br />Domino, was a horrible choice for Aries.  It lacked too much to list.  And Kronos, what was that.  what about the<br />other titans.

B005HJWWW8|3.0|Out of the box, this amp was almost unlistenable paired with my Droid Razr.  Even with using the longer cord, it would pick up considerable RFI / EMI from the phone that could only be eliminated by putting the phone into airplane mode.  Adding a snap-on ferrite choke from RS to the longer cord reduces but does not entirely eliminate this buzz.  I've not yet tried wrapping the amp in foil...<br /><br />Updated 7/15/2012:  It turns out, after reading posts by the Fiio representatives on the head-fi site, that there is rampant counterfeiting of this amplifier, and the product I bought matches the counterfeits being sold by some of Amazon's partners.  Make certain that the partner you pick for buying Fiio products is an approved Fiio distributor.

B004E2XAFW|5.0|I became a Within Temptation fan a few years ago, after falling heavily for Nightwish and the \\"Viking Opera Rock\\" music genre in general.  I first heard their \\"Mother Earth\\" album and I enjoyed Sharon den Adel's melodic voice, though the intensity of the music was a little weak (for me).  I bought \\"The Silent Force\\" and it was much harder, while keeping Sharon's lovely voice.  I was hooked.  Then...I got \\"The Unforgiving\\".  It's a new dimension.  Sharon's voice is very commanding, the music is harder, and the production is great.  This is their first album that I can listen to completely from the beginning to the end, wearing a smile on my face the entire way.<br /><br />What keeps this album interesting is that each song tells a story and the lyrics all flow very well, with intricate musical work that is technically impressive but not boring.  Nothing ever sounds forced or as if it's being used as \\"filler\\" music.  The music is harder than their previous work, but is well produced.  I enjoy a very strong female vocalist accompanied by awesome musicians, and that's what you get here:  some solid Viking Opera Rock.<br /><br />Within Temptation seems to be headed in the opposite direction as Nightwish, who's getting too artsy for me (Imaginaerum).
1400069289|5.0|It's not a self-help book it's not a business book. There are very interesting insights about our habits in life, in every single part of it. The book helped me to look in a different way to may bad habit ( smoking-I will quit ) help me to improve my good ones ( cycling - running ), it made me realize that I can fallow an example in a work place setting and maybe change things. So this is a very nice book which can influence your life on every aspect. What do you want more for a 15$? I listen the book from audible, the narrative is fine but it gets funny when the narrator makes female voices...  I also bought the book in order to take some notes and barrow to my friend. Go and buy it.

B003K025TQ|5.0|...and gives us a mix of rock, folk, jazz and hot licks.<br />If for no other reason, this got me because of the two songs Keb' Mo performed on--\\"Am I Wrong\\", where Keb' works a duet with Taj Mahal, and the magnificent \\"Why I Sing The Blues\\", where Keb' shares lead vocals and licks with B.B. King, Vince Gill (Vince's solo reminds us how good and nasty he can get with an ax) and Jonny Lang.  \\"Why I Sing The Blues\\" has always been considered a B.B. staple, but this version just SOUNDS like it was too much fun.<br />  Highly, highly, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

B00000255X|4.0|Released in January 1976, `Desire' is the third album of Dylan's great mid-1970s trio, following up on 1974's `Planet Waves' and 1975's career-defining `Blood on the Tracks'.<br /><br />On its 1976 release, `Desire' became best known for its full-on opening track `Hurricane', protesting the innocence of boxer `Hurricane' Rubin Carter of a triple night-time murder in NJ. Dylan's stand became controversial because of Carter's conviction of the murders by unanimous jury verdict: many felt Dylan had sanitised Carter, who had previous convictions for multiple assaults with violence and done jail time. Carter was eventually pardoned due to the never-explained recantation of a key witness, but suspicions of guilt remained.<br /><br />`Joey' is another 10-minute song in similar vein, lionising mafia gangster Joey Gallo who was gunned down in New York City in April 1972 on his 43rd birthday, less than a year after his release from jail.<br /><br />The rest of the songs on `Desire' are a mixed bunch making the album something of an oddity. With the notable exception of the closer `Sara' (for many fans, Dylan's greatest ever poetic elegy) these songs are less personal than those on PW or BoTT. Narrative story-telling combines with the witty and whimsical on `Mozambique!', `Romance in Durango' (on which Bob sings convincingly in Spanish) and `Black Diamond Bay'. The lyrical oddity of the songs might be because most were co-written with Jacques Levy. The album also has a unique sound not replicated on Dylan's other work due to the dominance of Scarlet Rivera's violin as lead instrument on many numbers, and backing vocals from Emmylou Harris on most.<br /><br />Many fans consider `Desire' to be Dylan's last great album, due to his diminished output in the 1980s following `Street Legal'. However, Dylan's late-career renaissance beginning with the Grammy winner `Time out of Mind', the follow-on `Love and Theft' and the truly great `Modern Times' produced another high-wave crest in the long and eventful career of this genre-defining writer and musician. `Desire', though something of an oddity, remains a very good album with some fine and enduring songs.the long and eventful career of this genre-defining writer and musician. `Desire', though something of an oddity, remains a very good album with some fine and enduring songs.

B007V4LKRU|5.0|i went the extra mile to order the 2 lp set version of another incredible oddysey that is RUSH! everything i like about this power trio was more than what i expected, but then again the only expectations i have of this brilliant band is nothing but the best and this album delivers in spades!!! i bought the cd version at target the same day i ordered the vinyl, only because i couldn't wait for the vinyl in the mail! for what it's worth, get the vinyl version, so much deeper bass and presence the cd fails to deliver. if you're a hardcore fan (such as myself), treat yourself to the 180 gram pressing, plus you get a free mp3 digital download of the whole album(!).<br />i cannot wait for the novelization of this great work, let's hope these guys don't get ignored when the grammy people decide who should get the best rock album...come to think of it, who cares? Rush has never kowotwed to anybody, they're a band that continues to challenge themselves to dare the audience to take that similar journey with them! can't wait for the tour!

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book has given some legitimacy to hard-core porn, it is making the rounds of book clubs, making national news, on the best seller list, etc. It reads mostly like a teen novel that has been written for a 16 year old audience, but every chapter or so there is a hard core porn scene.  It is quite odd and disconcerting.

1608871045|5.0|Like so many others out there, I am extremely hyped for the final chapter of Nolan's Batman saga. To help bide my time until the film's July 20th release, I decided to check Amazon to see what was out there. The Dark Knight Manual, seemed interesting enough... and really the only book out there. I decided to take a flyer on it. Two days later, (thanks Amazon Prime!) and boy am I glad I did.<br /><br />I spent a good 2-3 hours just going through this book, page by page, artifact by artifact. You can really sense that this book was a labor of love by the people who made it. Never will you come as close to being an inhabitant of Gotham City as you are while reading this book. The book may seem small at 112 pages but there is so much detail that bleeds off every single page, with lots of cool easter eggs littered throughout.<br /><br />My only negatives are that I wish the book had a few more profiles of key characters in the trilogy. And that some of the individual photos used are a little dark.<br /><br />All in all, a really great book for the Nolan fan. It's definitely a coffee table book that will leave your guests with a smile on their face and one that you'll find yourself coming back time and time again.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I have one thing to say, since all of the other critics have fairly well hashed out what this movie was good for or not... watch the credits. There is a great little music video in there, with possibly my favorite shot: Sean Bean looking askance at two dancing palace guards. Seeing Julia Roberts expressions during the party scene is absolutely priceless, too.
B0086700CM|3.0|It's one of those games where you're saying &quot; OH MY GOD I JUMPED!&quot; but you lose. Sometimes it's addicting when you don't get frustrated. It goes smoothly on a kindle fire but if you have a old itouch it gets really laggy.Over all its an okay game for me.
0345803485|5.0|Love it! This book makes you want to keep reading and do nothing else, it draws you in, the many sides or shades of the character \\"Christian Grey\\" it's delicious and well it makes you want to try a new world with the playroom.
030758836X|4.0|I loved this book ... character development was fantastic.  It was completely entertaining and engrossing - I read it in a day because I could not put it down.  The only problem is the ending which was a real disappointment.  I'm surprised that more readers did not complain about the ending.  Of course not all stories end the way you want them to and I guess it's a good thing that some writers choose to go their own way but for me the end was upsetting.<br /><br />I guess that, in and of itself is a reason to read the book!

B0077SGMXM|2.0|Quitting a course before completion loses all progress and you have to start over.<br />This really sucks and no matter how good it is (it is pretty good), it makes it unplayable for me.  As far as I'm concerned all \\"mobile\\" games should be created for people who are \\"mobile\\" and therefore not \\"stationary\\" so they can allocate large blocks of time for a game.  The absence of a save option always equates to developers not willing to take the time to do it right.

1455508977|3.0|(I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.)<br />28-year-old Logan has done 3 tours of Iraq, and knows that the reason he hasn't been killed is because he found a photo of a girl in the sand one day. Ever since he found the photo he has been having a lucky streak.<br />After seeing one of his best friends killed after leaving Iraq, Logan decides to try and track down the girl in the photo. Walking for months across country with his dog Zeus, following shaky leads, Logan eventually reaches a place called Hampton, where he finds Elizabeth working for her grandmother at a dog-training business.<br /><br />Logan and Elizabeth hit it off and start a relationship. But Logan doesn't tell her about the photo, and she knows he's hiding something from her. Can their relationship survive when Logan hasn't told Elizabeth the truth about why he came to Hampton? And what trouble has Elizabeth's ex-husband got in store for Logan?<br /><br />This book was a fairly standard contemporary romance. I really hated the way that Logan lied by omission when he told Elizabeth why he was in Hampton. Starting a relationship on a lie is not a good idea, and I spent a lot of time whilst reading this book, dreading what Elizabeth would say when she found out.<br /><br />Logan talked on several occasions about his tours in Iraq, which I wasn't particularly interested in, as the thought of being in a war depresses me. I disliked the ex-husband - Clayton, who was basically a total pig, and felt sorry for the poor kid - Ben who had him for a dad.<br /><br />I didn't foresee the grand finale to the book, but I did foresee the happily ever after.<br />3 out of 5.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I purchased the trilogy several months before reading it because it was on the new york best seller list, when I finally got around to reading it I was glad I bought all three at the same time.  People need to understand this is not a Classic Novel, it's entertaining.  I hadn't picked up a romance novel in at least 30 yrs so I wasn't aware how explicit they had become. I agree with some of the reviewers and the complaints of the repetition but then this isn't Mark Twain or William Shakespeare.  I don't know what readers expect to get out of these books but I took it at face value, it's something different than what I had read in a while and I remembered the commercials (Calgon take me away) while I was reading.  It's a story about two people with many differences and how much they were willing to compromise to stay together. I don't agree with women being beaten regardless if they enjoy it or not but it didn't make me like the books any less.  I feel people have fantasies and maybe that's what this writer has touched on with the rat race we live in everything is so mechanical maybe we all need one of those \\"Calgon take me away\\" moments. It was enjoyable while you are reading it and in the end love conquered.

B00785P2QC|4.0|So I got this after playing the original Virtual City and it was just as fun,  without the story, hence why it's called playground. It keeps you entertained for quite a while. People have been  complaining that you have to pay money out of your own pocket, but you don't. Just don't complete any missions where you have to use investor points you didn't earn. Yes,  it would be much more fun if it was all coins, without the investor points,  but many games have that. They have to make money somehow. Besides,  the app is free!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like because if you leave it alone during the night it will still earn you money but very good graphics

1609611543|5.0|My husband wanted this book -  I didn't...  But, I ordered it from Amazon.  I started out as a cynic;  but we are reading the book together.  And, I must admit that William Davis has won me over!<br />He does use a lot of tough medical terms, which makes the reading a little stifled.  But, he makes a point.  He also adds humor.  Both my husband and I are trying the no-wheat diet -  he to lose weight, and me for health reasons.  Unfortunately, he is travelling for a month right now;  so can't weigh himself.  But, he is sticking to the diet.  I think he will be<br />happily surprised when he gets home.<br />This book is worth reading and considering.
B0006J28BO|5.0|The Cat Returns is an underrated classic. It's one of the most unique anime movies with fantastic characters and terrific voice acting.

030758836X|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  I didn't.<br /><br />****  SPOILER ALERT ******<br /><br />The first half was ok, but as soon as I found out what was really going on I stopped caring.  I just kept shaking my head at all of the preparations that had to go exactly according to plan. Too unbelievable.  Especially after the one thing that did not go as planned happened.  Because after that, Plan B is thought up on the run and then that goes exactly perfectly also!!<br /><br />****** A BIG SPOILER ALERT RE:THE ENDING *******<br /><br />The ending is terrible.  It's one thing to leave us with a screwed up couple, but don't give them an innocent baby for us to worry about!!  Not amusing.

1933952806|5.0|The first thing I did when I got my D7000 was read the users manual,  which was helpful and me got me taking pictures in no time. Then I purchased this book and found it to be extremely helpful! It took a while to read because going over every single function of the camera is quite daunting but I learned a ton about the camera! It is easy to read and understand. Extremely well written. I thought I knew my camera pretty well until I read this book and found out how much it is really capable of! I would highly recommend this book! I love the 'my recommendations' part.
B00012QM8G|4.0|after years of waiting i finally watched this movie and was pleased with it. its a sad story with a semi-happy ending about oscar schindler and his attempt to save as many jews as he could. its too bad the jewish people are taking a page from the book of the third reich these days

B005LAIGSM|2.0|I bought this movie with high expectations, but was quite disappointed.  It very much secularized which in the book was a beautiful true story of a Christian couple's commitment to their marriage vows in spite of tragedy.  No mention of God was mentioned in the movie.  Also in the movie the man does ultimately divorce his wife in spite of his resolve to stay true to his marriage vows.  The movie was very different than the book.  I would recommend the book but not the movie.

B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|Yeah. I'm pretty much done with this band. I'm not sure if this album is as bad as the last, but it's defintely \\"blah\\" and nothing stands out about it. Extremely mediocre and lacking in any real creativity. Too much rap & electronics and not enough rock. And I don't consider Chester screaming every once in awhile \\"rock\\". This seems to be happening to a lot of formerly good bands...Incubus & Staind to name a few. They just seem to run out of good, rocking, creative ideas.

B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app has a lot of photo editing options and the under interface is great but the developers need to spend some time making sure that the app doors not continually crash. With my galaxy nexus I have to sometimes start the app 3 or 4 times before it well actually open. This app has potential if the developers keep working on it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An original approach to a story we have heard countless times, this novel hooked me from the start and never really let up. Only slight complaint I would have is that the tonal shift halfway through changes the personality of one major character a little too much for my liking. But other than that, this is a great summer read and my favorite novel so far from an author who just keeps getting better.
0062197258|5.0|Into the Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes is a psychological thriller that is probably unlike any you've read or seen before. Her portrayal of OCD and love gone very, very wrong is gripping, and might even leave you wanting to check and re-check things over and over again, too.<br />Into the Darkest Corner is an intense book that was written with such thought and detail, it will leave you thinking about things in a new perspective. The main character, Catherine (also known as Cathy) is captivating and her fears about her ex-boyfriend, Lee is so intense it made me as a reader look at people much differently.<br /><br />The book is told from Catherine's perspective in two time frames of her life. In one she is a carefree party girl that falls in love with Lee. Her present-day life isn't as carefree, as she is now haunted by her past and is struggling with her very real fears about her ex, and her OCD is taking over her life. I don't always enjoy reading books with a split timeline, but this one is done in a very clever way, and I think it added to the suspense in the story.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book right up to the very end, and I can't wait to see it if it is turned into a movie. I highly recommend this as one of your summer reads, just make sure you check the locks a few times before reading.<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of Into the Darkest Corner, Harper, for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow!  What an amazing story.  I can't wait for the next book to come out.  Really...I can't wait.  After reading that whole thing in just a few days I don't know how I can wait months or years for part two.  I haven't felt this way about a book in a long time and it's a good feeling.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the most awesome game ever. Anyone who doesnt have this game or hasent tried it needs to get and play it. If you don't like the game that's your choice. Bottom line: BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Lots of fun! great time waster that never seems to get old. additional power ups and characters add a lot to the fun.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I couldn't put this book down when  I first got it. Since then I've reread it a out four times and I still love it. Debora does an awesome job of balancing the history, the supernatural, the science and the romance. I can't wait to go to her booksigning and get my hands on Shadow of Night.
B00005JPD0|5.0|It is one of my favorites of all time, and I am a very big fan of Denzel Washington, who caused me to really appreciate his work and amazing presence watching \\" Glory and Training Day\\".<br />This was actually a film I was reluctant to see.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Loved the plot and characters. The book comes together perfectly. I will be rereading this one asap! Neil Gaimen is an outstanding writer.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Reminds me of older Final Fantasy&reg;&trade; games. Makes mobile game fun in a NES&reg;&trade; style. Plays very smooth and the clontrols a very simple on a touch screen device.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|When you strip this book of all the kinky stuff it's just a romance novel. If you like twilight you shuld enjoy the trilogy. It takes your mind off your day I'd say job done.
0425263908|5.0|I was so bummed to finish the 50 shades series until Amazon recommended Bared to You . I must say I think this is the next hot thing! I fell in love with the characters and the beautifully written passion of two people with troubled pasts, this book is like a wonderful roller coaster ride and you won't want to get off. I've read some reviews saying its a 50 knock off. It does have its similarities but with its own unique story line. Give this book a try and you'll be impatiently waiting for the next book of the series like me!!!
0345803507|3.0|I felt the stories were hurried<br />not well explained<br />and anna having christian whip her during her pregnancy with ted and their daughter was stupid!<br />anna thinking about getting rid of ted because of christian being mad at her for getting pregnant!<br />Im glad towards the end he did start talking more to anna and accepted the baby and the fact he and anna had a happy ending to the story. christian's pov was interesting wish there was more of his pov than anna's
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|like hidden chronicles fun fun fun. i like it yes i do, i like it how bout u?  zippity  do da!
B006RUJST6|4.0|Ok, I am not in any way being negative, this book was really good.. It just wasn't for me really...  For others, the story was fantastic and a good read, just didn't do it for me.  I think the Author is extremely talented and has a way to just \\"suck\\" you into the storyline...  I would never say anything truely negative.  Do I think it is worth a download, Absolutely...  Will it go into my Re-Read List...  Probably not.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is so adicting i love it so much i rate ten stars but it can only go to five
0425263908|5.0|After reading 50 shades and not wanting to end in which it did I bought this and I love it just as much maybe even a little more pretty upset I'm done with it and now have to wait for October for the sequel but if your a 50 shades lover you'll love this just as much.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love it sometimes I pertend I'm in a actually performance it is a whole lot of fun so get it!
0525425764|5.0|This was a great book. I couldn't hardly put it down. I love John Grisham's books and they never fail to be enjoyable
B0086700CM|4.0|I really like it its just sometimes it get a little boring bcoz u do the same thing over and over...... jump, slid and move around
0345803507|5.0|There was alot of talk about these books all over the talk shows so I ordered it them. The first book left me hanging and I couldn't wait to start the next book.  They were an excellent read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good book... I don't normally read books, but this one I definitely couldn't put down. I ended up buying all three.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Enter into Abby's world. Abby like most of us in life wants a fresh start. She wants to go somewhere where no one knows her family name, a place where all her demons can be laid to rest, and most of all a place where she can find herself with out her past to haunt her. So she and her best friend move away to college, so that Abby can leave her old life behind. Only to find Travis. The person that reminds Abby in every what she desperately wants to forget. He drinks, fights, hot headed, and lives a fast life. It's no wonder why they are instantly drawn to each other as much as they try to fight it. Love always wins and your past never leaves you. Beautiful Disaster is coming of age novel and a romantic love story, that once your done you instantly want to start reading it all over again.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|I didn't want to rent it because I'm not a huge fan of Channing Tatum. But, I rented it anyway and...this movie is quite hilarious. I laughed at every scene, there were no dull moments, and it was an easy-to-follow plot.<br /><br />You actually feel for the characters, it was that good. In the beginning of the movie I hated Tatum's character, and felt sorry for Hill's character...then as the movie progressed my feelings were totally reveresed and I caught myself yelling at my T.V. that \\"Jonah Hill's Character is such a loser! I hate him!\\" The movie was so funny. Jonah Hill has great acting skills, and Channing Tatum, I'll admit, had me laughing so hard I was rewinding parts of the movie to see it again.<br /><br />Very funny flick. Highly recommended if you're into the \\"Pineapple Express\\" sort of humor.
0307888908|5.0|The Start-up of You landed on my desk in a very appropriate time as I have recently departed the federal agency I was with the past 8 years and am seeking what I plan to do in the future - patient advocate, consumer advocate, writer, blogger, possibly entrepreneur - all while battling my own life-threatening disability these past 19 years.<br /><br />As implied in the book, Linkedin is an important step in networking.  My profile has already opened doors for me that otherwise would NOT be possible, helped me secure a mentor to teach me new skills in digital photography, helped several heart disease patients sufferers locate me for further information after reading my review for [[ASIN:1591202914 The Sinatra Solution: Metabolic Cardiology]] here on Amazon and otherwise is giving me the much-needed confidence to move forward, once again, no matter how the dice rolls.<br /><br />If you find yourself at an unforeseen junction in your life, you need this book.  If you find yourself heading towards a major junction in your life, you need this book.  If you are confident in your career, if you have a pension in your firm, if you really believe in the American Dream and intend to remain in your same career in the same organization for the next umpteen  years, then you most critically need to review this book and prepare yourself as the world around you is very much likely NOT the world as seen through the rose colored glasses.
0670023329|5.0|Oh man, this book is really, really good. North Korea is such a strange country. Some of the things that you hear about it sound like they'd have to be fiction. This country is still mostly a mystery to most outsiders. The government keeps a very tight rein on what information gets out about the country. This book tells the true (true being the operative word, as this story is so unbelievable) story of Shin, a young man, who has lived his entire life in Camp 14, one of the infamous work camps. So what did he do to be put in the work camp? Absolutely nothing except being related to his uncle who displeased the North Korean government and defected. The government has a belief that in order to restore order to society, the families of those they deem criminals must be punished as well in order to wipe away the \\"badness.\\" It's a really crazy philosophy.<br /><br />In his latter 20s, Shin was able to escape from Camp 14. He's one of the very, very few that was able to do so. He makes his way through China, South Korea, before finally landing in the United States where he works as part of a NGO to draw attention to the plight of the North Koreans. His story is truly fascinating.<br /><br />The book does not just cover Shin's story. It also covers North Korea's history and present (both are equally as strange). It covers the issue between North Korea and South Korea (did you know that when polled, most South Koreans want unification but don't want it until after they die?). It covers the trouble that people have when they leave North Korea (freedom is not always that easy to deal with).<br /><br />This is definitely a story of human triumph. You can go through a lot of bad things but still come out okay in the end. The book doesn't end on a necessarily happy note but it does end on a hopeful note. If you are looking for a book that talks about the North Korea issue from a human aspect, this is a great book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the Hunger Games Tilogy.  I can't put it down even though I need to every now and then.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I like it for a free APP but I can't say I would pay more than 99 cent. Some of the shapes you have to find are weird.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|better than instagram! easy to use, lots of options. my preferred photo editor on my tablet. highly recommend to everyone!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An excellent read.  Very difficult to put the book down.  I thought I was too old for this type book, but the characters made it a very interesting read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|* its a great game without questions.<br />* Sometimes it could be hard to finish the game because I cant get any of the numbers out to help move the other ones. Most the time I have to get a new game.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|I happen to like B-Movies, and this is an excellent example of the genre. Steven Soderbergh directed this film built around Muy Thai and MMA fighter Gina Carano. So ya, the fight scenes kick ass, and I'm speaking as a Yondan with decades of experience in multiple martial arts.<br /><br />Otherwise this a pretty boiler plate spy thriller will some suprising A List actors. Michael Fassbender, Ewan MacGregor, Antonio Banderas and Michael Douglas. Ya, that is a lot of star power, but it's Carano kicking ass and not bothering to take names that really make this film. That's right, I said boiler plate spy thriller.  This is a Steven Soderbergh boiler plate spy thriller however, so it is a very well crafted film. Haywire won't be studied in film school for breaking any new ground, but it should be studied as an example of how a good film can be made from a standard film plot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love the challenge and that I have to play games to get the other games. they are pretty fun and easy.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|If you're loooking at the third installment you should already be familiar with \\" A Song of Fire and Ice\\" and this book certainly won't dissappoint. If you're not, go check out \\"Game of Thrones\\" and start there.<br /><br />While the books are very long I've been getting through them faster than average length novels. I started reading after the first season on the TV series (which I thoroughly enjoyed) but I can now say that TV version pales in camparison to the far richer story in the books.<br /><br />The writing is great and the story line is superb, following on from previous installments, things just start to get interesting and you can start to get a broader view of the storyline. I highly recommend this and any of the previous installments in the series.
B0002EXFNI|4.0|No one is ever going to mistake this for a profound or important film, but it's not gimmicky or exploitative, despite what Roger Ebert says.  Of course the film borrows liberally from the \\"nerdy boy gets gorgeous girl\\" genre, and the plot has some elements that strain credulity (such as the notion that one could empty a $25,000 bank account without showing identification).  But the ending was pretty original--at least, I didn't see it coming.  I won't give it away here, but I will say that they're right about one thing: those sex-ed videos we all watched in high school were so stiff and awkward as to undermine the very purpose of getting teenagers to talk openly about sex.<br /><br />Elisha Cuthbert is the strongest actress in the cast, and I honestly can't see what Ebert disliked about her character.  She's not just a bombshell; she is also vulnerable, trusting, and loyal.<br /><br />I'll mention one last thing I like about the film: although some characters are more likable than others, there are no purely evil characters and no purely good ones.  THAT'S a Hollywood formula I'm starting to get tired of.
0345803493|5.0|Don't miss out on reading this one ladies.  Even if you are not a romance type of person you will find this very entertaining and won't be able to put it down. Laters baby!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|it never works!!!! I have this app on my opossum and kindle fire and if u login. with the same email it crashes and is annoying today about 12 hours ago I did the create game random and it took 12 hours to find a player and now wen I try to create another random person it says creating player and I cant make a new game I hate that!!!!!!!!
0345803485|5.0|After finishing book one , I could hardly wait to get into this book.  Not only do I highly recommend book 2 but I suggest you order all 3 at once so you won't be left wanting.  Enjoy ladies, I know I did.
B00881VLCE|1.0|When I downloaded this app, it brought a VIRUS with it. If this screwed up my kindle I WILL NOT BE VERY HAPPY.
B000003CM8|5.0|For all that this album is not this is still one of the best releases by the Allman Brothers Band. This was Gregg and Duane's baby. This album was the beginning of a band that would still be playing some forty years later. This album is raw and honest and there is nothing slick at all about this album, not like some late 70's or early 80's albums. This album is the perfect marriage of the blues, gospel, soul, rock and and everything else. This cd had the first appearance of Whipping Post and Dreams. Sure, there aren't any pretty songs on this cd. There is no Blue Sky or Melissa. The mellower songs would come later. This is just the ABB doing what they did best in 1969. Although this album didn't break the band into the national spotlight it still can't be denied that this is one of the best ABB albums ever. And as for the cover photo of the band, the back photo at Rose Hill Cemetary, and the \\"in the creek photo\\", this is where the legend of the Allman Brothers Band began. It all began with this lp/cd and of course the word of mouth which came from the band's many small gigs, free shows, etc. This lp still stands strong some forty years later.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|If you're into movies about this period then you're going to love this one.  It definitely raises some questions about Shakespeare.  I also liked the Queen Elizabeth connection.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|OK, I just have to say that this is not my usual type of read, I'm more into Romance/Drama/Paranormal kind of books (don't judge! lol). But this book had me sucked in from the get go! It was fun and somewhat addictive reading through the familiar 80's references (born in the 80's myself) and I must say I nearly sh@t myself with excitement when Planet Goondocks was mentioned (The Goonies- best effing movie EVER!!!) Anyways, this was a top read, it had my brain engaged the entire time, great storyline, witty and also intelligent :-) Would have been nice to have a sex scene or 2 in there, just to satisfy the pervo side in me (once again, don't judge lol I did mention I like to read trashy romance novels) and the whole \\"humping a lubed-up robot\\" and \\"spanking the monkey\\" does not cut it sorry, but I guess physical intimacy would be non-existent when it comes to a bunch of recluses :-/ Oh, and the whole Aech thing... totally had me in stitches!!! :-D
1936608898|4.0|love the program, great content, easily accessible info. Occasionally was annoyed with the snarky/funny tone, but that is a mild critique all things considered
B0063IH60K|5.0|Awesome game! The fact that you have game options, specifically replay so you can figure out where you went wrong. No problems with the game and works great on the kindle fire.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This is a very User friendly app..  The weather alerts are from the national weather broadcasters, and in most cases ahead and better than the local weatherperson.
B0058VW36U|1.0|It was fun for the first hour or so. Then it just started to be repetitive and get kind of boring.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|great fun and challenging. got it on free day making it a steal. can run battery down playing so long.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game to play the kids enjoy playing this game also but I am trying to find new neighbors .......  ,.............................
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game and a great time killer. always loved Oregon trail and this is a beauriful Sim with great Oregon trail themes.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|I bought this product from Best Buy and I am curious about this converting to cd and stuff and do you have to get speakers to connect to it because when i use my i can not hear anything at all. Can someone who also bought this product help me. I am not done but I am a seventeen year old and this is my first turntable.
0307454568|5.0|Great book!!!I wish there were more to read in this collection, I am going to miss Lisbeth and her adventures
B00007KQKM|2.0|The only reason I gave this move 2 stars is because Sean Bean was great in this movie and some other actors were good to.And the second star is for I am a Sean Bean fan.But if Sean Bean wasn't in this movie it would get 1 star.I was always hesitant on watching this movie and now I see why. Last night I watch this movie and I didn't like it. Their are things I didn't like about this movie. First their was no chemistry between Sean Bean and Joely Richardson. For a I moment saw it, but then it went away whey they put to much, like Sean said it best in the movie \\"f***ing\\" scenes in the movie.Because you can't call it love making,you just can't .I felt more chemistry between Connie sister and Olivier when they met for the first time and had a argument on why he not the man for her sister.And he told her off.Then some of the times I had to fast forward because it was getting to be boring.Then I didn't like Connie played by Joely Richardson constant whining throughout the movie,if I you are going to comment adultery you should at least be confident and not whiny. A few times I had to fast forward her parts she was really getting on my nerves.In the movie did like the relationship between Connie and her sister had with each other.Even though they were different they still had each other backs.Then after \\"f******\\" Mr.Mellors 3 times she finds out his name,finds out he is also in a loveless marriage,  and oh yeah then poof she spitting out she loves him.How in the hell can you be in love after \\"f******\\" someone 3 times? I don't call it love, I call more like infatuated or lust.And then Connie getting jealous for him having a picture of his wife hanging in the hut were they \\"f***\\" at and were he lives at, when he already told her his wife didn't love him and she left him.I really felt that was a stupid part in the movie,if I was Connie I'm not going to get jealous if something or someone who isn't their. Out mind out of sight, honey.I wish they had more tender scenes in the being and less \\"f******\\" scenes in back of the movie instead of the other way around, it was back wards. I didn't feel any passion or the love. This is not a romance movie I felt that this story had no substance I didn't see the love growing between Oliver and Connie. And that were I'm more disappointed at, I just didn't feel the love between the two.I wish they had gotten to know more about each other.I wouldn't buy this movie watch it on YouTube like I did or rent it from the library. But if you want to see more love,more passion, and more tenderness in a movie go watch Harlequien Romance movies or Danielle Steel's movies on YouTube or you can find it right here on Amazon. But if you just want to see a good \\"F***\\" movie then this is a best movie for you. :)
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I loved this book.  It is a funny lighthearted read.  I could not put it down, once I started.  I would recommend this book.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|fantastic fun. hope more games are available soon like this one. the price is great and well worth the hours of enjoyment. I strongly recommend to everyone who wants to relax and enjoy some logical game time.
0385733577|4.0|I love myth, fantasy and action.<br />These three things are all in one book! Tee-hee. Right now I'm slightly geeking out over this!<br /><br />When I saw the name Nicolas Flamel I was thinking, \\"...Harry Potter?...\\" You can imagine my shock when I read that Nicolas was REAL. Who knew?<br />Anyway, the summery on the back interested me and so I read it.<br /><br />*takes deep sniff*<br />Aaaa.<br />I love the smell of a good plot in the morning. It fantastically original (OK, not the `Magical Twins' part), I haven't read a book with all Mythologies are real. And there's magic! Proper, Harry Potter magic.<br /><br />The writing is...ok. It's not the best, Scott sometimes repeats terms, but I don't care. I'm so head-over-heels-in-love with everything else.<br /><br />Nicolas is mysterious, Dr Dee is purely insane, Scatty just ROCKS, I connected with Sophie, and Josh is an absolute idiot. Sometimes; I just want to wack him in the face.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|I have to sheepishly admit the first couple times through this CD I couldn't decide if it was a yawner or if I should keep listening.  That said, this cd is incredible.  Beautiful in fact.  Makes me want to go out to the mountains and catch some trout and sit under a tree and do nothing all day and be in complete splendor.  And this album would be the soundtrack.
1423113454|4.0|NOTE: Rick, I don't believe that Sadie's only 12.<br /><br />This was right up my alley! Being an Egypt-Lover, I devour this book whole. True, it's a little long, but there is so many things happening you don't really notice. The timing is also great! It runs nicely with the story.<br /><br />OK, the plot *could* have gone better. I mean, chaos seep into the world? Not very unique when it comes to Egyptian tales, I have to say. : (<br /><br />Carter is very likeable, and Sadie is...well; she's a snarky Mary Sue. I'll be honest, that's the vibes I got from her.<br />And I'm SO glad that my favourite Egyptian God, Anubis, is in it. But he should have been more included! He kind of comes and goes. Boo.<br /><br />As always, Rick fills pictures in my head as he writes!
B00782O7IY|2.0|This movie slogs along on some tried & true Hollywood tropes & lots of long slow stretches of treacly sentimentality. The \\"hero\\" is supposed to represent an icon from the classic period of silent film but from the few movies you see him performing in it's hard to tell if he's supposed to be Fairbanks, Chaplin or Valentino. I think The Artist would have worked better if the Artist had been portrayed as a consistent character with backbone & spunk, but ultimately he's just a cartoon Norman Maine, from A Star is Born, wallowing in self-pity.<br /><br />Harold Lloyd made many films in a similar vein but every scene was filled with inventiveness & humor as well as pathos.<br /><br />The dog should have received the Oscar.
1594744769|4.0|4.5<br /><br />I was extremely excited to read this. The cover lured me in and the summery seduced me.<br />It was love at first sight.<br /><br />Of course, I wasn't disappointed. The plot was unique and refreshing. I simple loved Riggs Time-Travel concept.<br />And I loved all the peculiar children! Olive; the girl who levitates, Millard; the invisible boy, Bronwyn; a girl with amazing strength, Enoch; a boy that makes dead things come alive, Emma; who throws fire, and Miss Peregrine are all of my favourite characters! (The Ballerina-Boys in the photographs were my favourite, too. But they never made it into the book. *sigh*)<br />But I don't like Jacob in particular. I don't know why, there's something about him that I just don't like...<br /><br />Riggs has a nice writing style. But, Riggs editor has to brush up on a few things. There were a few mistakes. Tut-tut, editor.<br /><br />Riggs better make a sequel. He can't end it like that! And I NEED to hear more about the peculiar children!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a cute game I let my daughter play it. it reminds me of Mario brothers. I used to love that game.
0439023521|5.0|NOTE: I read this a few years ago. *Way* before a movie was planned.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I wasn't too keen to start it. I don't know why, I was just hesitant. But as soon as I read that first sentence, I was somehow hooked.<br />And that first sentence, that one sentence, was all it took for me.<br /><br />I think it was Collins' writing that first drew me in. The detail and emotions she describes - it just sent shivers up my back.<br /><br />Katniss, I feel, is a cunning and strong female character. Now-a-days, we rarely see a girl like her. Most authors aren't interested in a strong woman hence why we have characters like Bella from twilight*, Jacinda from Firelight and Sam from Shiver**. Katniss, for me, was always the one saving Peeta or some other guy's skin.<br />Speaking of which, I must mention my adoration for the little bakery-boy. Is it just me, or is he Katniss' puppy? He follows her around the place, wanting to be loved by her. I found it quite cute! And I thought that Peeta was very nice and kind. (but I didn't like the way he joined up with Cato and co.)<br />Gale on the other hand...well, I liked him in the first book - short as his appearance is - but when I travelled deeper into the trilogy I found myself loathing him. But, since I'm not reviewing the second and third book, I'll just say that Gale was a short and likable presence (in the first book). ***<br /><br />*When Edward broke up with Bella, she laid on the forest floor, in a ball, and cried herself to sleep. Twi-hards please face facts; that's NOT the characteristics of a strong woman.<br />**No, that's not a mistake.<br />***By the way; THE TWO GUYS WHO PLAYS PEETA AND GALE IN THE MOVIE ARE DELICIOUS.<br /><br />The romance isn't important in this book (thank the gods), it's a nice little thing to add for good measure, but that's all it is; a little thing. Katniss is a little too busy keeping herself and Peeta alive to sit all-day and kiss him.<br /><br />The world-building, I shall admit, is not original. Teens killing each other? Where have I heard that...oh yes; Battle Royal. The bloodiest book I have ever read in YA. I was a little upset at the start that Collins has the same idea as Takami, but around the middle of the book I began to realize something; a lot of books are the same in some ways. And so what if they have the same concept? As long as it's good, why should you care?<br />NOTE: I did read Hunger Games & Battle Royal. And I love both equally.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has written a fantastic novel, I can tell that in the future; it will be written down in history with Harry Potter.Hence why I have rated it 5.<br /><br />However, there was only one thing - only one mind you! - that bothered me. And that was Foxface. Being a large Foxface fan, I was gutted that Collins decided to kill her off so suddenly and so easily. Foxface was clever, sneaky and had slyness about her. She had great potential. So why did Collins make her death an `unfortunate mishap'? I do hope that the Suicide Theory for Foxface is true, because if Collins does deny those facts (and to my knowledge, she hasn't): I will change my star rating.dmit, is not original.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|My first listen I was thinking \\"this is a pretty good album\\". I have now heard the whole thing at least 15 times and it keeps getting better everytime I hear it. This has turned out be the best Alt-Rock album I have heard since the 90's, SP or otherwise. Do yourself a favor and buy Oceania and listen to the whole thing at least 3 times. Fantastic.
1466401885|5.0|Read this book in a day. I could not put down. I love all the characters. I cared about them. There were times I was mad and frustrated and yelling at the characters and other times laughing out loud and times just smiling because I was happy for the characters. This is an easy read and a great one.
B007Y6OZE0|3.0|In my opinion, this is The Offspring's first bad album. The first two and last two songs songs are decent, Dirty Magic is excellent as always and the rest is garbage. They went on and on about this being like Ignition and Smash, but it's the poppiest mess they've ever done. My biggest gripe, however is the sound quality, as the cymbals sound like crappy MP3 files.<br /><br />The Offspring will never return to their original metal-injected punk style and I think Holland is getting a little too comfortable with this 'pop' thing. I'd hate for this band to end up like Def Leppard...

B000H1RFKU|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BLU RAY VERSION ***<br /><br />I remember seeing \\"Training Day\\" at the cinema in 2001 - the audience applauded at the end - and most left their seats with its gritty brilliance seared into their unconscious. I'm glad to say that revisiting this urban drug story in 2012 finds that Antoine Fuqua's directorial debut hasn't lost one jot of its power - and better still - is now genuinely enhanced by its reissue on BLU RAY.<br /><br />The picture quality is far better than I expected - a really crisp transfer. Its default aspect is 2.4:1 - so there are bars top and bottom of the screen - but even stretched to full frame - the print quality still holds up. A lot of the scenes are one-on-one dialogue pieces in the front of cars between the two male leads - but expertly filmed and edited - there's no real blocking. Side shots of their faces are startlingly clear - even the sequences towards the end in people's homes and out on the streets at night are very, very clean. It's a top-notch transfer...<br /><br />Written by DAVID AYER (a white man who grew up in the South Central projects of Los Angeles) and directed by ANTOINE FUQUA (a black man who did the same)- it's about a fresh-faced cop Jake Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke) who is hooked up with legendary narcotics Detective Alonzo Harris (played by Denzel Washington) for one 'training day'. From dawn to dusk - it will be a baptism of fire.<br /><br />At first Alonzo has the air of a man who's doing what he has to do to keep the river of drugs off the streets of Los Angeles. His methods may be brutal - but in the heat of street-justice - the end justifies the means. The problem is that while the young rookie cuts the mustard in the eagerness department, unfortunately he's also highly principled - and this begins to encrouch on Alonzo's habit of turning the other way when he's gathering info to make busts of the big guys (15,000 years of incarciration handed out and counting). Alonzo also feels that Hoyt's Academy naivety will get him killed in the real world (dialogue above). So Hoyt struggles. But then things get gradually murkier...and even life-threatening...<br /><br />Soon after a car bust - Jake is drawn into Alonzo's doped-up world and begins to feel like he's being played - but Alonzo keeps proffering believable reasons for his actions. Only a brave intervention (a young Latino girl being raped by two lowlifes in a lane) saves Jake from the clutches of a double-barrelled bathroom death. Soon (bruised and battered) Jake is taking the game to Alonzo's neighbourhood - and on it goes to a brilliant but inevitably bloody ending...<br /><br />Part of the reason why \\"Training Day\\" works is that there's an air of authenticity in the script that echoes The Wire and The Sopranos (both Author and Director have been there). The bad language and street talk is either vicious or impenetrable - and frequently both. A dance of fear and intimidation co-exists between the cops and the largely Black and Latino communities. No one is clean and few get away from it unaffected. Some areas of the city are even no-go zones - poverty and bad housing being a breeding ground. Gun law abounds and it's hard to tell the difference between Dictators - the drug-pusher or the police officer who protects the drug-pusher...<br /><br />Denzel is truly magnificent in the part (a departure from his nice-guy roles) - he inhabits his gold-chained Alonzo with a power and ferocity that few actors could even get near. You feel this mouthy monster owning the areas he walks into and you understand why many of them smile as Alonzo approaches - but would gladly put several bullets in his back as he leaves. Ethan Hawke does well to keep up with such a tour-de-force - and at times - even matches him. It's not surprising that Washington took his 2nd Oscar for it (\\"Philadelphia\\" was his first).<br /><br />The supporting cast too is exceptional - rappers Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre as drug-dealing hoodies - singer Macy Gray as a crack wife - Eve Mendes as Alonzo's squeeze - Scott Glen as an old veteran - and the trio of corrupt officials - Tom Berenger, Raymond J. Barry and Harris Yulin (who feature in the 'Alternate Ending' in the Extras). And special mention should also go to the locals and the then unknown Latino cast - some of who are actually gang members. Fantastic stuff...and so impressive...<br /><br />To sum up - a great film then - now made better by a format that allows it to shine.<br />This is precisely what a good BLU RAY reissue should be.<br /><br />Recommended like a hard rock in the crack den at the back of The White House...(yo Barrack).<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />VIDEO: 1080p High Definition 2.4:1 Aspect Ratio<br />AUDIO: Dolby Digital English 5.1, French 5.1 and German 5.1<br />SUBTITLES: English, French and German<br />EXTRAS:<br />1.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush has done something remarkable - in a career that includes some fine moments (cuts like \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" \\"Red Barchetta,\\" \\"YYZ,\\" \\"Closer to the Heart,\\" \\"Spirit of Radio,\\" a somewhat hokey but inspired-in-its-attempt 2112 and, more recently, convincing rockers like \\"Animate\\" and \\"Far Cry\\"), they've put together an entire album encompassing much of their vision as a band, delivering the essence of the philosophical message they have worked on for the better part of four decades. Depending on one's view, Rush has either crisped-up its sound enough to make it newly-relevant, or discovered the essence of what its sound had been tending towards all along.  Whether turbo-charged for the twenty-first century, or a distillation of key `70s and `80s sounds, it doesn't matter.  Rush has made metal art.  Rush has delivered an intense, slightly off-center, hard-rockin' concept album.  With all band members around 60, Rush has made what is going to have to register as one of the better - perhaps the best - rock album of the year.  Rush has handed long-standing fans, and the newly interested, an artifact that absolutely says \\"this is what we're all about.\\"<br /><br />It's been a long (long) and radically uneven journey for the band.  The talent has always been there.  Rock isn't classical music, or even jazz - we're not talking about super-trained musicians whose compositions are going to be taught in music schools across the country.  Geddy Lee, Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson can play, however, and every musician in rock knows it.  The lines and grooves Lee and Peart provide in Rush's rhythm section have long been totally unique; few rock players can execute, let alone imagine, some of the lines they do.  Lifeson's rhythmic and occasional solo tonalities are also inventive - they sit between Andy Summer's or the Edge's \\"background pastel\\" rock guitar and Eddie van Halen's and Joe Satriani's electric hero shred.  Rush's talent and an unquestioned sense for music provides powerful moments.  The singles named above are examples.  Intellectual rockers from \\"Bastille Day\\" to \\"Free Will\\" to instrumentals like \\"La Villa Strangiato\\" are totally unique.  Surprisingly melodic and atmospheric B-siders from \\"Lakeside Park\\" (Caress of Steel [1975]) to \\"Cut to the Chase\\" (Counterparts [1993]) to \\"Peaceable Kingdom\\" (Vapor Trails [2002]) give a sense of the dimensions of Rush's sound.  They're more accessible than Yes, heavier-hitting than Pink Floyd, harder than the Police, and they provide strong moments.  For the most part, they've always done so.  After disappointing albums in the late `80s, early `90s and then again in the late `90s after semi-revivals like Counterparts (1993) (Test for Echo [1996] might be the worst Rush album), Rush has grown.  Vapor Trails (2002) was imperfect but often intense.  Snakes and Arrows (2007) had a few clunkers (the attempt to be pseudo-folky on \\"The Larger Bowl\\" was just boring).  Generally, it rocked, though; Snakes and Arrows spoke to the slightly intellectual heavy-rocker that's always been Rush's fan base.  A lot of tracks bordered on the excellent.<br /><br />Not all, though, and that's the problem - with Rush, for every \\"Time Stands Still\\" (the poppy yet nonetheless good tune from 1987's Hold Your Fire), there's a \\"Tai Shan\\" (a lord-knows-what-they-were-thinking banal ode to a Chinese mountain from the same album).  And before fans react by saying that that was Rush's \\"bad, synthey\\" period (a) they made good music there too (Power Windows [1985] has a number of strong cuts) and (b) even in their oft-favored `70s proto-metal, prog period, Rush could come up with some hokey stuff.  The schmaltzy kung-fu, China-stereotype segues in \\"Passage to Bangkok\\" (an otherwise great tune) should do what?  Are we really supposed to remember \\"Cinderella Man\\" from Farewell to Kings (1977) as a great tune?  \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" form Permanent Waves (1980) is seven and half minutes opus concerning what, exactly?  What do we do with at least half the songs from Presto (1989), or three quarters of Roll the Bones (1991)?  Have Rush's live performances been so different from their studio cuts that the band's needs nine live concert albums (never mind eleven greatest hits collections)?  The guys in Rush - based on every interview and report I've seen - are modest, self-effacing, direct and well-grounded.  However, afraid to market their stuff they haven't been.  Songwriting is sometimes a concern.<br /><br />This provides the Rush dilemma.  Is Rush a slightly off-beat \\"chops\\" band who sometimes hits the spot and sometimes doesn't, marked as much by inconsistency as by real vision?  Or does Rush in fact have a vision we - even guys like myself who really like them - don't always get?<br /><br />I've tended towards a blend of these perspectives.  In the rock-u-mentary, Beyond the Lighted Stage (2010), tracking Rush's career, Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan heaps oodles of praise on the band, wondering where they fit into the pantheon of the Stones, the Beatles and Led Zeppelin.  They don't.  Despite having sales rivaling those bands, Rush never pushed the cultural fold in terms of capturing the atmosphere of the 1970s, `80s or `90s and speaking to counter-culture in its various forms and manifestations.  À la the Beatles and Stones in the `60s, or Zeppelin in the `70s, Rush was never connected to a set of politics, be they the peace movement, the right to rock and give the finger to one's parent or even the right to drop out in a heavy LSD-hash haze (telling is a scene from Beyond where Lifeson, as a teenager, negotiates [as in chats with] with his parents about not finishing high school - hardly the \\"screw `em\\" hard rock attitude).  Rush clearly rocked - even their first album (1974) packed a surprisingly heavy direct and sophistocated crunch.  However, Rush rocked in a private way.  Rush combined many of the musical innovations from the `60s and `70s - primarily the idea that rock should be taken seriously - yet explored those innovations as music.  Culturally, their impact was minimal.  As Sebastian Bach from Skid Row (whom I was pleasantly surprised to find out is a Rush fan [and super funny guy]) said, Rush was the kind of band who \\"got you fired-up about literature.\\"  They knew something.  But what they knew, you weren't exactly sure.<br /><br />Still - and Rush plays mostly one dynamic (loud), with angular, non-funky grooves - no one does (or perhaps even can do) song like \\"Red Barchetta.\\"  No one busts into airplay rotation with tunes like Far Cry.  The drum beat from Tom Sawyer is one of the most memorable moments in rock.  Rush is entirely key to the progressive movement, and certain sectors of metal.  Certain tonal and rhythmic moments by Lee, Peart and Lifeson literally make you stand up and cheer.  It's hard not to be impressed by the overall effort in early concept albums like 2112.  And, if one really listens to some later work, like Signals (1982), there are good - really, really good - moments.  And they keep coming.  Rocking harder.  Snakes and Arrows was quality.  Vapor Trails was better than many give it credit for.  Until Clockwork Angels , that had spanned more than three decades of up-and-down, but nonetheless solid, work.<br /><br />How Rush got to Clockwork Angels is both hard to say and not.  It's hard to say because, though the present-day rock industry is diverse, Rush's sometimes naïve, \\"wow, it's just amazing what we can do with a guitar, set of amps, massive drum kit and some imagination\\" can feel a touch out of place; rock takes itself seriously, and flights of fancy are oft-dismissed as irrelevant.  Yet Rush has made a serious, serious album.  Elements - the best elements - from almost every phase of their career may be heard across Clockwork Angel's twelve tracks.  When Rush is on point with its musical skills and has a clear sense of where it wants to go, few bands pack more punch or are more fascinating.  Every song is good and, indeed, some of Clockwork Angels' tracks are more than winners.  \\"Caravan\\" - out for nearly two years as a single - is a great, great, hard rocker.  \\"BU2B\\" is hardcore; its message of individuality is driven home with an unrelenting, electric bass/guitar counterpoint.  The title track, \\"Clockwork Angels,\\" is as good as anything as the band has ever done; it's got SUPER grooves, good dynamics, funky sounds, tangible metal grit.  \\"Halo Effect\\" is gorgeous.  \\"The Garden\\" - in a term not super-often associated with Rush's music - is actually flat-out beautiful; its orchestral Rush, and it works.  \\"The Wreckers\\" is maybe the album's flattest tune.  But it's listenable.  \\"Headlong Flight\\" and \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" are more, \\"we're simply not gonna give up with our long, complex grooves until you like `em (and some of `em are gonna totally blow your mind)\\" champions.  And the album transports a \\"spirit of 1976\\" progressive, hard-hitting, \\"we can play, we're longhairs, we've got big ideas while also having metal on our minds\\" spirit to 2012.  Apparently, today, we talk about things like \\"steampunk\\" (the aesthetic from movies [and books] like The Golden Compass evoked by Rush on this album).  Today, we've experienced things like grunge and classic rock revival (Nirvana, Pearl Jam or Lenny Kravitz anyone?).  We have retro sensibilities.  However, the early twenty-first century isn't so retro that one can't get away with things if they don't somehow sound new.  Rush hits all the buttons.  In doing so, Rush has written the masterpiece of their career.<br /><br />Since I bought my first Rush album - Moving Pictures (I got it as a used LP in a church basement sale as a fourteen year old) - I've loved the band.  My love for Rush was often as much about what they were trying to do - create a fully-musicianly, aesthetically-accessible artistic rock (which was still rock) - as for what they actually did (sometimes accomplish their goals, sometimes not).  I dropped out as a fan inthe `90s.  That had to do less with Rush than rock; I wanted to learn more, so I studied music for a while, and my rock interests took me to jazz.  It was quite some number of years before I allowed myself to taste metal again.  I was unsure if Rush was still around (I found out they were back a couple of years after Vapor Trails).  Since my mid-teens in the late `80s, I'd always turned to each new album wondering if this is the one on which they'd fully realize their potential - would it be the album on which every track would rock, the guys would never slide off into bad song-writing (or over-production) and Rush would find a way to deliver its admittedly-amateurish yet nonetheless relevant philosophical message (enlightened individualism) in a package both palatable yet intense?  That's Clockwork Angels.  It will mark the bands legacy; it's the album to put next to 2112 and Moving Pictures as the best of Rush.  Indeed, in simply being themselves, Rush actually convinces us the sounds they create - and ideas they see accompanying them - demand as much attention as those being produced by anyone else. The members of the band claim they've been up to the same thing all along.  Perhaps true.  In any case, with Clockwork Angels, Rush has given us a full hour of heavy-hitting, super well-played, inventive music asking us to consider what we value in rock. Clockwork Angels points to where rock has been and where it might go, reminding us of the pleasures, both intellectual and visceral, we might have along the way.  It's an experience worth every minute one spends with it.
0441003257|5.0|As the 666th reviewer of this book, I feel that I should have something special to contribute. Alas, such is not the case. There is nothing I could write that hasn't already been written. The satire in this book was both amusing and refreshing, while not being particularly nasty. It is a short read, I finished it in six hours, and I definitely recommend it if you're looking for a short escape from the forces that are \\"always mess'n with people.\\"
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This is a great book- great examples and really motivating to get<br />your mind thinking in the right direction.<br /><br />Read it the first time at the beach recently and now re-reading it<br />again to highlight and reinforce the key points. As a result<br />have put in place steps to be up and running with new business<br />idea within next two months. I have had this idea for some time,<br />but after reading this book, it was the inspiration needed.<br />Well worth your time, it will change your life...<br /><br />Thank you, Chris!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love the story line in all of these books.  Especially like how the dragons start coming of age and what they can now do.  Can't wait for the next book to come out to see what happens.
0545101425|4.0|These series of books had me on edge with each book.  The overall ending was not at all what I was expecting (which is probably why I am not a writer).  I did enjoy all of the books ......... I was just wanting better endings for several of the main players in the story.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I love the first Sherlock Holmes and this second movie was not a disappointment to me.  I hope there is a third one.
0205313426|5.0|This is an excellent book that can truly improve anybody's writing. It includes common mistakes and problems with style, from small concepts such as misusing apostrophes up to large concepts like being unclear or too wordy. It helps the reader to see their own style from a fresh perspective--ease of reading, tone of voice, etc. I highly recommend it for anybody who writes at least occasionally.<br /><br />As for as this edition, the binding is good and it's a great value for a hardcover at this price!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I had to read the book first to see if I could watch the video.  The story line followed the book very closely and the realization of how horses where used at one time I found fascinating.  Just sorry how they where used and abused.  However, the story line is great and some stories have happy ending even in war.

1612680011|4.0|\\"If you go to school and get good grades, you will get a secure job and be successful.\\"<br /><br />We have all heard that quote in our lifetimes regardless of our age. Teachers, mentors, and most of all, parents prescribe to that doctrine the most. However, the advice is outdated. Unfortunately, the majority of people still subscribe to this mentality. There exists such a thing as Financial Intelligence and those that acquire it are considered to be savvy with money by knowing things that the Financially Unintelligent do not. Two basic tools that any person should know to be considered Financially Intelligent is: The Income Statement and The Balance Sheet.<br />The Income Statement is comparative analysis of Income and Expenses. If one has an income that exceeds their expenses, there will be a net gain in money. Reciprocally, if one spends more than one earns, there will be a net loss of money. The Balance Statement is comprised of Assets and Liabilities. Assets are things that make money over time, i.e., stocks, bonds, real estate, and exotic trading items. A home is not an asset, contrary to popular belief. Though a house's worth can rise over time, it is considered a liability. Consumer loans, mortgages, and credit cards make up liabilities.<br /><br />I found this book highly readable and entertaining throughout. I found a few typos in the book, which was shocking, but did not take away from the main message.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|To think a society would live like this I found very different in most things I have read.  My complements to the author for having such an imagination to take her readers to many different levels of feeling which I had through out all these books.  Would recommend to anyone to read these books before you see the movie.
1416595546|4.0|Let me start by saying that SASHENKA is 544 pages.  Let that soak in for a moment.  Yes, it's longer than your typical 300-page novel and, yes, it is a not a \\"beach read.\\"  I myself was intimidated.  I also needed quiet and privacy when I read the book because its subject matter required my total focus.<br /><br />Although it's not the typical type of book I go for, I did find myself pulled into the story of Sashenka's life and the drama throughout the span of her life.  To me, she felt like the Evita of Russia, falling down, but then picking herself back up again and again.  Unfortunately, the novel also read like a non-fiction book in places; very heavy in Russian history and politics, which aren't my strong suit.<br /><br />All in all, though, I was glad that I read the book and feel that I have a better understanding of what life might have been like for someone living in Russia (and then the Soviet Union) in the 20th Century.  Their lives certainly aren't comparable to events in the U.S. in the 1900s.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This movie was one of the best scariest movies I have seen in a good while.  Had me jumping in different areas of the movie because I was just  no expecting what happen.  I also feel they will not see this actor as Harry Potter anymore.
B0009IOR6Q|3.0|Cry-Baby (1990) is admittedly a very entertaining movie, designed<br />for the youth segment viewership. It is almost a musical from the<br />litany of talented musical performances and songs appearing throughout<br />the movie. It also is a very visual movie, thereby demonstrating the<br />remarkable skill of the actors, producer and director. i.e. the dialog<br />is almost redundant in enjoying this movie, as a result.<br /><br />Humor is also very present  and welcomed  in this picture.<br />Johnny Depp's casting as a youth is a success, coupled with the lovely<br />Amy Locane who is his partner in this adventure. For those pulling a<br />blank like me about one other character, it's really the rocker Iggy Pop.<br /><br />There are some surprising elements here, for horror fans too, as a<br />couple of actors play zombie-like people with bizarre attitudes.<br /><br />Also, for the more sophisticated or adult in the crowd, there is the<br />intellectual appeal of the economic & class struggle shown in the<br />movie. i.e. Amy and Johnny are from different backgrounds, and each<br />family attends their own different stereotypical events, each typifying<br />mores, norms, values and behaviors that underline that fact, only here, in<br />this story, it's for laughs and to typify the absurd, but still<br />remaining real.<br /><br />Coincidentally, this film was viewed for the first time the same weekend<br />(and again the next) that actress Susan Tyrrell passed from Hollywood.<br />RIP to an artist with a strong presence on the silver screen, in the same<br />style as Iggy Pop's.<br /><br />Cngratulations to Hollywood and all artists for an artistic,<br />humourous and imaginary world that they were able to create over 90 minutes.<br />The visuals and music are very strong...worth paying a ticket to see.

B0031RS7MW|4.0|This book was amazing to read...and I am so glad that it came in the kindle version...the story is quite a bit different than the movie and yet it is not.  The movie is set back in the 50's and the book is 90's but it's a great read.  I would really recommend purchasing this book and I may get the next book as well.

B005POK858|5.0|it is the best RPG i have played in years i love it. Review done by Pete Zumwalt.like i said before i loved this game.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|These types of books (descriptive S&M) have been around for years.  I'm not sure what was so special about this book that made it hit the mainstream reader lists. The first book was interesting, but after finishing the entire series it felt like it was originally one book and the publishing industry saw the dollar signs and suggested dividing it into three.  It should have just been one book.  Read it-if only to know what the hype is all about, but don't expect a well-written book.
B005HI7NP0|5.0|This is hands down one of the best CD's I've ever heard.  It has an old school flare with a new school vibe.  The collaborations are classic and well put together.  It is a very special CD to me that has very relevant songs to my life, my beliefs and just a good groove and vibe to listen to.  If you don't get it, you will definitely miss out!!  Truthfully, I'm kind of falling in love to this CD.  He introduced it to me, and it's OUR CD.  Anyone that wants it, has to get it themselves, we're not sharing... ;-)
B007SGM084|5.0|THIS WAS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ  IN A LONG TIME ,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN TILL I FINISHED ALL THREE<br />NOT TO SHORT ,GREAT READING ,HOPING EL JAMES DOES MORE THEY KEEP YOU ON YOU TOES ..5 STARS ON THIS ONE...
1610454812|5.0|I just finished the audiobook and am simply stunned. You absolutely MUST READ this book.  Moving, warming, stirring, inspiring, challenging, it causes to you reflect on your own life.  I found myself endeared to Adam, and it was all the more painful and sorrowful to not only hear about his death, but so much more to learn the impact on SO MANY lives that people cherish him so much, from so many walks of life.  God truly used his life for our benefit.  Thank you, Eric Blehm, for a story SO WELL TOLD. Thank you, God, for his life.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app does just what it says!  easy to use, easy to figure out, and very helpful. I just wanted a calendar and a checklist for the day that I could carry with me, and this is perfect. love that I can have other lists too that I can add to so I will remember things I need to do.  So glad I found this!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run! It is very fun and addicting! I am really glad I downloaded this app. I hope you like it too.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This series is a fantastic read. I am not usually a fan of books with a fantasy element, but the intricate plot makes it hard to put these books down. Utilizing the appendix is hard on the Kindle, but the written work itself is great!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This first installment is breathtaking.  I will immediately buy any future work written and can't wait for him to start writing full time.  The story is broad and envolving, with numerous characters that make you smike, hate, and laugh.  The action is very fast and engaging.  There is nothing bad I can point out.  Truely one of the best fantasy books I have ever read.
B001W63DX2|2.0|mine did not work on tv but it work on my laptop..:(good my husband still like it,im kinda scared since its my first time to order dvd here but glad it work in pc..
B003TH2G4Y|5.0|When I first saw the information on The Seeker, I thought it probably is just like some of these other series! Boy, was I wrong!!! Where was I when this series was on TV!!!<br />I downloaded the first season and it was so interesting that it kept me glued to the TV wanting more. My husband who is a sports nut actually started watching it with me and<br />he was also wanting more. We would sit and watch as many as we could every night. We downloaded the first season and then the second season. We were so into the series we didn't<br />realize that The Seeker would end after Season 2. What a shame!!! Who is the idiot that ended this series?
0486409511|5.0|This is a very handy book! I've been using it myself and it goes over copperplate well. I really recommend this to people who want to learn this fancy calligraphy.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|There are a lot of promising features to this app, and for the most part it works.  However the one feature I was really excited to use, focal point with color shift, doesn't work properly.  On both my HTC Evo Shift and Asus Transformer, the focal point shifts as soon as I apply it.  no problems though loading from the gallery and no forced closes.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and was amazed at how good it was considering the poor reviews when it was released.  I doubt a follow up movie will be made, but Disney did a wonderful job of creating the world of Mars in a somewhat believable fashion.
B004SEUJYG|5.0|I still think that the Blu-ray rendition of a movie has to be initiated at the start of filming and is not something you can just tack on to a movie out 10 years and call it \\"Blu-ray\\".  I really didn't notice any difference in the output quality of this film compared to the regular DVD.  The argument here is not the movie itself but is it really \\"Blu-ray\\" or are we being scammed?
B004T2QZL8|4.0|Despite many negative reviews about the force close, I decided to spend my .99 cents on this game and give it a try. Let me tell you, that it was worth it!<br /><br />First Impression: Doodle God is a game of using your mind mixed with a bit of imagination to come up with some really cool elements. After Doodle God downloaded, my first impressions of the game was that it runs really smooth and was really clean cut. If you are a fan of cartoon style animation, than you will love how this game looks!<br /><br />Pros: The pros for this game is the feeling of creating a new element! When you have two elements that go together, you will know it right away! It is pretty amazing what you can do when you start out with only four elements and now I have over a hundred. If you appreciate games that have no lag to it, than this game is for you as well! I was able to try many combos of elements without having the game lag.<br /><br />Cons: The con in this game to me is, creating elements that you have already created. I wish that if you already made that element, it would not allow you to create the same exact element. I found myself doing that many times because it is hard to keep up with exactly when you have many elements already created.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really great game for the casual player. My wife and I enjoy this game together when we are just relaxing. Also my four year old was able to make some elements that my wife and I didn't think of, so imagination is key here! This game is really easy to play and will have you entertained for a long time. If you love quotes, every time you make an element it will have a quote at the bottom that relates to that element. I give this game a B+ (P.S. I got this game a couple days ago and it hasn't crashed on me at all!)
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome best game I have ever played game is too cool to eve put my kindle down.  I never play anything else just temple run.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I could play it forever trying to beat my highest score. get it and you wont regret it. seriously!
B006GHA9VQ|3.0|BluRay has beautiful photography and scenery but lacks the expected memorable melodies typical of Andrew LLoyd Webber. I rate it as OK but not outstanding.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|came in great shape and was exactly what I wanted, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
0307352145|5.0|If you are one, parent one, love one, have one as a friend ... read this book!!!  I just finished it.  When I started it, I felt kind of vindicated in a shallow \\"SEE! Introverts can be awesome too.\\" - but the further I went, the more deeply it affected me because I had so many people who thought I needed to be different in my world from an early age that I bought in to thinking I'm somehow defective.  I'm not saying poor me, my life is ruined because I wasn't parented right or anything like that -  it's taken every experience I've had to make me who I am and for the most part, I like me.  But to find myself described so well in these pages - see where I've tapped into strengths that do work \\"out there\\" - find out it isn't just me ...  Well, anyway, this book is awesome and affected me deeply.  If you ever thought you were defective because you preferred books, solitude, don't like small talk, get drowned out in groups, etc., read this book - there's some good information in it for you!  And for goodness sake, if you're a parent or teacher of a quiet kid - read this book!
B0036SPOHC|2.0|As a democrat I have to say Moore is really out there. He fails to realize off the bat that the gov is involved with evicting those homes. He fails to mention freddy and fanny being responsible for these people not being able to pay. He leaves out any kind of hint that the government allows all this to happen and is involved. I don't think he understands corporatism vs. capitalism.
B007DUW242|5.0|great item, but the list price at legoland is $14.99. So shop around, and have a great time. (kids under six will need help with small parts.)
B0072QPV6I|4.0|I only discovered The Chemical Brothers in 2011 after watching \\"Hanna,\\" a terrific action movie by Joe Wright.  TCB did the soundtrack and knocked my socks off.  Now I'm well past my clubbing days, but the electronic music emblematic in this concert film is nothing new, in fact Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons have been doing it for years.  It is my understanding this is the first time a concert has been filmed however.<br /><br />Needless to say, it rocks.  Filmed before 50,000 screaming Japanese at the Fujirock Festival, TCB adds unbelievable visuals to their thumping beat and rarely lets up.  This style of music isn't something I listen to for long periods, but each time I was about to stifle a yawn, the guys kicked it up a notch.  This is a complete sensual experience and will give your surround system and subwoofers a workout.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc starts immediately.  There are no trailers, warnings or other crap that you have to page through.  You can chose uncompressed Stereo PCM or DTS-HD Master Audio 7.2.  Go for the latter and crank it up.  The picture is excellent given this is a a light show as well as a concert.  I could have done with less viewing down audience's throats but the camera captures how engrossed they were.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|I had heard about this book due to the movie of the same name which got a lot of acclaim in the press.<br />I am not a baseball fan per se but I found the book quite interesting- central premise/idea that raw player statitics are an underrated form of evaluation and often predicts future athletic success. If you are a sports fan and a baseball fan in particular its an enjoyable and thought provoking read.
B005LAII1C|4.0|I'm a big fan of \\"Family Guy\\" and Seth MacFarlane but I generally don't like movies with humans and uh...stuffed animals who can talk.  In this film, also written by MacFarlane, young John Bennett gets an oversized Teddy bear for Christmas.  John is even less popular than the Jewish kids who are beaten up each year by the Christian kids.  He wishes his Teddy would become human and be his lifelong friend.  Bang!  It happens and the two form a bond.<br /><br />Years later as a 35 year old desk clerk for a car rental agency, John still has kid-like tendencies but for his 4 year relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis).  Lori puts an ultimatum to John.  Rambunctious, profane Ted must get his own apartment or she will move on.  This of course doesn't sit well with Ted who enjoys his pot smoking time with John.  Ted (MacFarlane) enjoys the best lines and while they aren't consistent, some are damn funny.  MacFarlane's humor is fast and he doesn't give you much time to absorb it before moving on to the next joke.  I also suspect many of quick hits will sail over some people's heads.<br /><br />Joel McHale and Giovanni Ribisi are along for the ride as foils for John and Ted.  Sam Jones enlivens a party at Ted's pad.  He of course is from John and Ted's favorite movie \\"Flash Gordon\\" from 1980.  The bit is funny with some recreated scenes from the film.  Also look for Patrick Warburton and Ryan Reynolds in a hilarious brief cameo.  Finally, Norah Jones, playing herself, helps Ted and John try to mend fences with Lori in a scene you won't believe.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love this game it is so much fun! if youre 12 or under its the best if uu havent cn the movie theyre the best!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use. Many different versions based on your needs. I have recommended this to others. Easy to follow lessons.
B00884GR0W|3.0|make it so the monsters can only stay in the under world dude they interupt me when im doing something
B008AT71WI|5.0|This is a brilliant, funny movie adapted in 1986 from the 1982 Off Broadway musical of the same name.  That musical was, in turn, adapted from the 1960 Roger Corman film, \\"The Little Shop of Horrors\\" (non-musical, dark comedy).  The 1986 film's musical numbers are wonderful, and Levi Stubbs delivers a fantastic performance as the plant, Audrey II.  In truth, the entire cast is spectacular!  If you are unfortunate enough to have missed this gem, pick it up now!  This version is the one to get.<br /><br />I was a little confused when I saw \\"Director's Cut\\" but the same runtime (94 min.) listed as that on my 1998 DVD.  So, I did a little research and discovered that this new release has both the original theatrical release (94 min.) *and* a version with the original, darker ending!  Better yet, the original ending is now in color!  From Warner Home Video's announcement of the new release: \\"The footage of the original ending was previously available only in black & white in the extra content of a limited number of copies of a DVD edition released in 1998. Now, with the help of production notes from Frank Oz and others on the film's creative team, WHV has meticulously restored and digitally remastered the ending, in full color, with the elaborate special effects intact. Sound has also been rebuilt and mixed in Dolby 5.1. The theatrical version has also been re-mastered.\\"<br /><br />From IGN's website:<br /><br />\\"Extras will include the following (no word yet on which of these extras are exclusive to Blu-ray):<br /><br />  - Theatrical version of the film with optional commentary<br />  - The Director's Cut featuring the newly restored 20-minute alternate ending<br />  - Digitally re-mastered picture and 5.1 sound on both versions<br />  - \\"Frank Oz and Little Shop of Horrors: The Director's Cut,\\" an introduction by Frank Oz with Richard Conway<br />  - \\"A Story of Little Shop of Horrors\\" (behind-the-scenes documentary)<br />  - Outtakes and deleted scenes with optional commentary<br />  - Two theatrical trailers<br /><br />The Blu-ray will also include a 40-page Digibook with production notes, stills and rare insights.\\"<br /><br />So this is the version to buy!  The 1998 DVD was also in 5.1 Dolby Digital, and many of the extras are repeated from the earlier DVD (the commentary, outtakes and gags, production notes, and trailers) but the remastering should make this movie pop on HD TVs!commentary<br />  - Two theatrical trailers<br /><br />The Blu-ray will also include a 40-page Digibook with production notes, stills and rare insights.\\"<br /><br />So this is the version to buy!  The 1998 DVD was also in 5.1 Dolby Digital, and many of the extras are repeated from the earlier DVD (the commentary, outtakes and gags, production notes, and trailers) but the remastering should make this movie pop on HD TVs!
B0081L37Z0|4.0|Funny - A good movie to rent, not sure if Id add it to my dvd collection though. I thought it would be predictable, but it really wasnt.
B004EPYZUS|1.0|Apparently a lot of people liked this film a lot.  I thought it was lousy, even by the really generous standards of action/adventure films.  It was so hopelessly implausible, it made the James Bond films look like PBS documentaries by comparison.<br /><br />The bad guy mad scientist got away with stuff that no lone bad guy could get away with; Cruise and his IMF team are supposedly cut off from support (the President has \\"disavowed\\" them), yet they still have access to trainloads of ultra hi tech gear; and hopelessly arbitrary changes are made, when convenient and throughout the film, regarding previously established plot points.<br /><br />Dramatically, there is no sense of the IMF team either facing an authentic challenge, or a sense of them earning their victories along the way. The \\"ghost protocol\\" in this film is the ghost of the writers making outcomes arbitrarily work out in favor of the IMF team, without really presenting imaginative solutions to the problems they do face. How do you root for a hero who has his victories handed to him on a silver platter by the rewrite guy?
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Down loaded the game, hoping it was going to be fun enough to pass some time while my daughter was in the hospital.  Out sure did.  Not only did I enjoy playing it, when I got done, my daughter and wife also had to take turns playing it. Is it the greatest game ever - no - but it is a real good game.  Made it hard to keep my phone charged. LOL
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this game  it keeps me and my siblings entertained for hours. I love the fact that you can keep getting more and more games by getting more points!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a great way to increase your vocabulary and also help you in writing.  I would recomend this not only to my adult friends but to their children as well.
0099579936|2.0|So I have read all three books and I have to say that in real world terms this guy can't last more than 5 minutes! If that were me my GF she would have dumped me a long time ago. OK scratch that if I were filthy rich she'd keep me and find a guy that can screw for hours! This dude is a dud! Oh and orgasmic virgins? Really? Where!!??!!<br /><br />The BDSM sequences are unrealistic and dull. I have lived the lifestyle so I know from which I speak.<br /><br />Overall it's an OK read but the erotic parts leave me feeling less than erotic.
B00881VLCE|5.0|So many options. Way KOOL! I would definitely recommend this app to any one who likes doing puzzles. From young to old.
B002WJI66C|2.0|the one i bought looks a little bit different, theres a suction cup on top of his head and his tongue is sown down to the middle of its stomach so his tongue doesnt pop out like the one that is shown. also the mouth on it is different the material is sown where the material is pulled back to around a third back of the plush. so it makes it look weird.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Fun for the first couple of minutes but it gets old quick. not sure why this game is so popular. Also can anyone who owns a kindle fire help me? Everytime I click web it goes to a blank gray screen then immediately back to the main menu (carousel). I can go to the appstores but not the actual web anymore :(
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is pointless but its just fun to play...ive already play 9+ hours of it and its still fun lol...get this app...you can thnk me later...
145162445X|4.0|Krauss traces the remarkable transformation in cosmological understanding which has come with the Einstein- Hubble era. He explains how the great question of twentieth- century Physics i.e. Whether the Universe is contracting or flat or expanding has been decisively answered in favor of Expansion. He provides a dramatic picture of our own present time in the Universe as a very special one in which we are capable of observing one- hundred billion galaxies. He says that we will come to a time when all galaxies  will expand away from us but our own and we will be left with the ability to observe only our own Galaxy. He gives the scenarios for the ultimate outcome in disintegration of our Galaxy. He also provides a picture of the Universe in which the very stuff we are made of, the atomic matter is a small portion of the total stuff of the universe. The Dark Energy and Dark Matter which Krauss has himself worked to detect are the factor leading to the Universe's expansion. All of this Krauss wants to argue makes us not only insignificant to the universe as a whole but even more insignificant than was previously thought.<br />Our long- term future then as he understands it is 'miserable' oblivion, back to 'Nothingness'.<br />As Krauss understands it then there is no long- term hope for Humanity and certainly no long term hope for any kind of salvation from a personal God. Krauss even wants to as it were 'prove' that our Universe came not by Divine Creation but from Nothing, a Nothing which he calls the 'Laws of Physics'. All this is discouraging to someone like myself who does believe and pray to a personal God. And who believes that there is more in Heaven and Earth ( And in the human future) than Lawrence Krauss understands.
B005HSL626|5.0|well I tried this on my friends iphone and got it on my kindle fire it is addicting and I recommend it to anyone who wants to have fun
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|is interesting to look for objects even if it is the same ones over and over again, but could someone please tell me how to play the minigames?! Is very frustrating that no direction at all was given.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is soo addictive....I have been playing it everyday after work for the past 4 days!!!!great download deft worth it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Tons of games for the kids to play. Keeps them occupied on long road trips.  Just wish it would rotate with my kindle.
0525478817|4.0|The fault in our Stars was my first John Green book to pick up but will certaintly not be the last. This book moved me tears in the best possible way.  I would recommend this read to anyone, so do yourself a favour and read this book!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Wow! This hidden object game is the best! Lots of objects, lots of levels and so many rooms with various search games. I love it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I stayed up till 3am in the morning trying to finish it. Very well written,and a nice easy read, and great plot. The style of writing kinda reminds me of Patricia Briggs/ Rachel Vincent.  I love the characters and can't wait to read the second book!  It does contain sex scenes but i've read harlequin books that are actually more graphic. I think its shocking to most because of the BDSM theme in it.
B005ZUR724|5.0|this is a must buy for any wow fans! the gameplay and graphics are great! I'm level 6 now. see you in the game!
0345803485|4.0|Excellent book... Can't understand why everyone says its rubbish?!? I really enjoyed it & have ordered the second!! What's wrong with it? Nothing!!!!!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this game. so I deceided to get it on my kindle fire my sister got it on hers first and it worked great no bugs or any thing definately worth it I love it!!!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It makes thumb typing so much more easier! It comes with a lot of nice features from additional language packages and optional keyboard layouts to cool themes. Worth every cent!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|great game. it is a game that makes you think and solve puzzles. I reasly like it and I play it whenever I get a chance.
B007BDK3SS|3.0|where is update?<br />it has no update a long time since 2012-3. but updates far way on google play market!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I really can't stop listening to this album.  each song is rich, unique, and catchy.  Reminds me a bit of both the decemberists and florence and the machine.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Really? I just don't see what all the hype is about. The characters are ripped from Twilight, sans myological creatures, with slightly older characters & with adult themes. I could list them, but if you've read Twilight, you already know. If I were Stephanie Meyer, I'd be pretty pissed. But after reading a bit about this book, I suppose the joke is on me, as it was originally released as a Twilight FanFiction, and therefore it was supposed to be Twilight with adult themes.<br /><br />As for the writing itself? Rather elementary, if you ask me. The characters are not at all deeply built & the descriptions leave a lot to be desired (pun mildly intended). It is quite difficult to fully picture what it happening when there are so many missing descriptions. I still don't know exactly what anyone looks like, how tall they are, etc. About 4 chapters in, I gave up and just used Edward & Bella in my head. Worked just fine. The story itself is on the surface slightly intriguing - the young virgin meets a man who spins her - but it is quite unbelievable that she would be emotionally & physically capable of what she delves into & so very successful. I suppose that could be the mythological aspect this story owns, however I do not believe it was intended to be so.<br /><br />Ah yes... and as for the sex scenes. Of any of the scenes they are only a few short sentences in length & if it were really happening - keeping in mind descriptions take longer to write & read than they would to actually perform - the scenes would only be a few short moments. I suppose it could be written in such a way that they are to be a synopsis to leave the reader's mind to wander, however given that the rest of the story isn't, I can't imagine they are (considering the whole story, in book one, took place in matter of about three weeks & is 500+ pages).<br /><br />Overall the story left me waiting for the literary climax (not physical climax, as there so many) & unimpressed. I suppose reading Anis Nin,The Sexual Life of Catherine M, Lady Chatterlly's Lover, etc has left me bored of this story. What I can say is that it is more of a story of a broken man's re-entry into the world of the rest of us & a young woman's childlike devotion to her first real crush object - who abuses her mentally, sexually, and physically, than it is about sex.<br /><br />The BDSM stuff is suitable for Cinemax, and the controlling, over bearing, raging jealousy, abusive, psychological brewhaha is suitable for Lifetime. In thinking about the themes further, it is rather disturbing that so many woman are swooning over this story. Typically when one engages in a dom/sub relationship, it is on their own decision to do so - meaning without coercion, and trust in themselves & their partner is imperative. There is no trust or real willingness here. I think there's a nasty word with grave consequences for just that situation.<br /><br />So if you want to read it so you too can feel the burn, you may very well be highly disappointed & possibly a bit angry by the encouragement of an abusive relationship. I read it because several people I know did and said it was fantastic.  I suppose I gave into peer pressure, and got burned. Now I just want my $10 back. And it kind of makes me wonder about my friends...
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The game becomes addictive when you try to pass the whole story. Who knew smashing pigs with psycho birds could be fun! I highly recommend it.
B007PZ6T80|4.0|I have no doubt that Synapse Films release of RED SCORPION will be near the top of any action fans list of releases from 2012. The film was handled with care and skill and is accompanied with a slew of entertaining and insightful extras. Highly Recommended.    Full review available at [...]
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds seasons Free is so much better than the regular angry birds. I got to give a thumbs up!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|little bit buggy but very nice and graphics cute. networking feature doesn't work at my kindle fire device. acorns are very pricy.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game. Easy to play and fun too.!  wish the cards were bigger though...... still lots of fun to pass the time.
B005EHNPRO|5.0|This LP, (yes I say it should be listened to on Vinyl) could be bought and paid for for this lone song. One Sunday Morning.  But aside from that fact, this is brilliant, might I say americana..?  Start to finish, solid. What a great relief to have such a band such as tweedy and the boy's, pumping out true real music. No sense in slamming any other band, but none can live up.<br /><br /> Perfect heating up the old tube amplifier, smelling the dust burn on the tubes and having such a tight band blasting through your speakers.  If you are gonna buy it, buy it you know what to expect. If you are hesitant about Wilco, well judge away. Don't buy it and expect YHF, it's not, it's The Whole Love.
B007LNJ4YW|4.0|Lush and melodic, Beach House really hits their stride with this album.  Think shoe-gaze meets summer electro-pop; a chill album that remains atmospheric that stays relatively upbeat and enthralling to listen to.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|The fact that this isnt free makes me think this is a total ripoff! Why isn't it free!? I mean really!<br />Well this review would have been good if it was free but I guess not because you have to pay for this.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How on earth is this a best seller? It is Edward and Bella meets 9 1/2 weeks. The characters have no redeeming qualities and I kept reading to see if there would eventually be a plot other than fight and have sex. Nope. 3 whole books of the same garbage. I cannot believe I actually paid for these! I have no problem with the BDSM aspect for consenting adults. But the behavior outside of the bedroom (or shower or bathtub or car or boathouse or pool table or elevator or red room of pain or boat or plane or anywhere else these 2 have had sex) is dysfunctional and borderline psychotic. For a man to treat a woman in such a controlling stalker-like manner is not something to be glorified. Anastasia is a stupid, spineless twit who really needs to be smacked upside the head, not on the bottom. It seems that very few people who actually liked this book have ever read any type of erotica and it must just be a novelty. Obviously they dont realize that it is possible to read a book with sex AND a plot. I just want my money back.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|If you could zoom on find the diff side by side & maybe a bit more the regular searches - this would get a 5 - or if I was younger - when I didnt need bifocals ! :)
1878424114|5.0|This was a fantastic read - I keep it handy so I can refer to it whenever I need a reminder or a pick-me-up. I definitely recommend this, and have already sent copies to friends!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|When I first saw the movie (probably in a theatre when it first came out) I was entranced.  I had never seen the TV miniseries, so I had nothing to compare it to, and I'd only read the book once, years before. So I came at it fresh, and based my opinion only on what was onscreen. I thought that Knightley was brilliant, and captured the lighthearted but also serious sides of Lizzy, and that MacFadyen was, I have to say it, a dreamboat. The filming - the amazing tracking shots, the way it moves in and out of window, the character actors playing all the other roles (Blethyn, Hollander and Dench are all FANTASTIC), the incredible scenery and lively earthy settings - I loved it all. I even set some of the music as my phone ringtone!  I watched it occasionally on TV over the years, and have always loved it.<br /><br />I just bought the DVD (June 2012, 7 years later) and watched it all the way through in one sitting.  In the last few years, I've read all of Austen several times through, and watched many film and TV adaptations, including the Firth/Ehle P&P, and the 2009 Emma with Jonny Lee Miller and Romola Garai. Both of those, as 4 part mini-series, can be much truer to the plot and pace of the book than a 2 hour movie can - this P&P has to speed through the plot, especially the second half.  And I notice it more now - we miss a lot of the character development and the true friendship that develops between Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />I still love a lot about it - it is gorgeous, the acting is mostly wonderful. But with Austen's language more fresh in my mind and ear, the departures from her words, and the made up dialogue and scenes (some of which are necessary - she never writes much dialogue for proposal scenes - and some of which are extremely unnecessary) were more jarring.  There were some cringeworthy changes - making Mr. Bennett weepy in the scene where he gives Lizzy's marriage his blessing; \\"Yes, a thousand times yes\\" spoken by Jane when she accepts Bingley's proposal, and most sadly, one of my favorite lines: \\"you have bewitched me, body and soul, and I never want to be parted from you again.\\" It's just too pulpy for Austen - she would absolutely have made fun of such language.<br /><br />Despite these criticisms, it stands the test of time - it's one of my favorite Austen adaptations, alongside Emma (2009) and Mansfield Park (1999) by Patricia Rozema - another that's absolutely beautiful to watch but departs enough from the book to make a lot of fans angry.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Received my Seiko Automatic with the Green Fabric strap about two weeks ago.  Absolutely great watch for under $70.  Thanks Amazon.<br /><br />Pro's: Great style and works well with my ACU uniform.  Also wear it with civilian clothes, but it's not dressy enough for sport coat and slacks.  Maybe I need to get another one with a leather band.  I have medium sized wrists (70\\" 180lbs) and this size fits me well.  Description for my SNK805 says its 37mmx11mm with a 16.8mm strap. The similar SNK806 and 809 list at 37mmx13mm and I have not measured mine to verify. My 'perfect' automatic watch would be 38mmx8mm.  Anyway, this one fits and looks really nice.  I also have a 1950's era Oyster Constellation and a Benrus from the same era.  This Seiko gives me a modern automatic without the worry of damaging a timeless classic.  Time is very accurate and have not needed to adjust the time since the initial sync... but (see Con's below).  21 jewel movement on a 37mm watch makes for a very smooth second hand sweep without the chunky movements of a quartz.  I love to watch it sweep around the dial.  The open back is a nice touch, definitely a 'pro', but largely useless. Another cool feature is the military style face with the minutes on the outer dial and the hours on the inside.  Makes it easy and simple to pick your minutes.  The transition to this style face was trouble free and actually makes more sense. Watch includes a day/date feature that is easy to set. Hands are luminescent and give a good glow for a while (I've not tested the length of time it lasts). Our work areas get completely dark when the power goes out and that happens regularly.<br /><br />Con's:  Time is 2 minutes fast after two-three weeks.  This is normal, however it may annoy some.  The watch does not have a mainspring 'charge' indicator.  Not that it really needs it, but many folks looking at automatics look for this feature.  The second hand luminescence is heavy on the 'back' side and not on the pointer, so in pitch black you need to remember that your watching the tail sweep around the face and not the pointer end. Online description says its a Japanese movement, and it may be, but the back face says 'Movement Malaysia KY'.<br /><br />Overall:  Very pleased with this purchase and am looking for another. I was not sure what I could expect for a sub-$300 automatic, but am very pleased.  I also trust Seiko to deliver a good product.  Normally I would stick with a $300-$500 automatic for reliability and function but this is a great move on Seiko's part.  Please make some more.<br /><br />Update 12/12/2012<br />I wear the watch almost 23 hours a day, it is very comfortable and well balanced with a bias towards the watch.  The band seems looser than when I first purchased it and sometimes the watch want to work its way upside down around my wrist.  Not often, but noticeable when working heavily with my hands.  The watch keeps better time now.  It ran ahead almost 8 minutes per month when I bought it, and now its about 3-4.  Pretty good for a sub $100 automatic.  Dropped and banged, this watch is taking it all. It replaced my quartz watch as my go to timepiece.  Very happy with the purchase.o in pitch black you need to remember that your watching the tail sweep around the face and not the pointer end.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is very nice in that it sets the fire up at an angle to where you can read it easy.It makes it nice when your eyes are a little weak. The elastic strap keeps the flap that covers the screen when not in use.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is probably one of the most popular games and it certainly deserves it. With it finnaly on Kindle you can see obstacles better and that sure does help when you are going super fast. But there is a problem that bugs me a bit. It lags. For some people it doesn't lag as much but its different for everybody so just a little warning also it doesn't open for some people so there's another warning. But great game and have fun if you get it!
1455508977|1.0|This book manage to say the same thing over and over again. It was like the author was just trying to fill the pages. I was hoping for something better, more romantic, but it was the same old thing. I think I am over Nicholas Sparks. All of this books are just that same old thing.

B003JTHTZS|5.0|Sashenka, I couldn't have left  it in the bookstore after having read the worldwide known Sebag Montefiore's Russian history books. I knew it, it was a good choice. Sebag Montefiore  is an accomplished historian and turns to be also a talented novelist.<br />Sashenka is a beautiful historical novel with the added value of having an absolutely faithful historical background, which makes it also a pleasant learning instrument.<br />It is the story of a woman, Sashenka, in Russia before and after the revolution.<br />The plot is divided in three parts.<br />Sashenka as a young girl, Sashenka as an important official figure in Stalin's regime, and the archival research of a young woman in contemporary Russia.<br />In this away, some passages are skipped, making the developing of the story more agile, and creating a growing sense of suspense between the second and third part.<br />One. Sashenka was born from a nouveau riche family. The household situation is discomforting and makes the young girl feel uneasy. Through an uncle, she learns about the initial ferment of the revolution and immaturely but passionately she throws herself into the cause.<br />Two. We find her married to an important man of Stalin's regime and she herself occupies a relevant political role. Sashenka has children and a serene life. The perfect high rank Bolshevik family. One day she does something unexpected. And everything takes a dramatic turn.<br />Three. We are in contemporary Russia, a student is asked to make some archival researches on Sashenka.<br />Since the beginning, the reader can perceive some sort of anxiety, like a crescendo. Then there is a dramatic explosion, followed by the silence and slowly a new life, and new windows are opened on the past. Some of those talk about love, devotion, passion, some others about death, sacrifice, fear.<br />In Sashenka, Sebag Montefiore develops the events on the setting of an accurate  historical background. At the beginning, it is possible to grasp the flavor of the preparation ground for the revolution thanks to the vivid descriptions of places, characters who certainly lived at the time, facts, methods, clothes, architecture, taverns, smell and noises.<br />And then the regime, the rigid system, the power, the hierarchy, the relationships among the men around Stalin, the reverence, the dread, and also the prisons, the tortures, the bureaucracy. The intangible is given in a such dramatic way, that it's natural to feel the terror in all its aspects.<br />Particularly fascinating (and philologically reassuring) is the mingling of fictional characters with historical ones. There is an episode in which Stalin himself visits Sashenka's house.<br />The plot is intriguing, complex and smooth at the same time, the dialogues are well orchestrated, the shifting of the scenes has a good rhythm, the visual descriptions are precious, the characters' psychological introspection is well articulated.<br />Wonderful compelling story, the story of a clever woman, sweet mother of two beloved children who lived in her beloved Russia, in one of the most dramatic changes in its history.<br />It could be a great subject for a movie.<br />Sashenka, the woman, followed me for days after I finished this Sebag Montefiore's novel.<br />It made my cry.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|Seriously. I decided that if all these people were reading and raving about the Fifty shades books they must be okay......<br />Obviously I was wrong.<br />Dear Lord who let this writer out??? In my wildest dreams I couldn't have come up with such drivel - how do I explain to my lovely students in September that no, life is not like this novel - they are probably not going to meet up with a multi-millionaire, sorry billionaire of 26 who is besotted by their beauty, in fact cannot control himself when my darlings bite their lips in an anxious schoolgirlish fashion, that if Christian Grey in fact exists he should be avoided altogether, that a man who hunts you down is not usually good for your health and well-being, that no-one is going to buy you a car within two weeks of your first date, that allowing a man you really don't know tie you up and beat you with a riding crop is not such a good idea, that no-one will ever ask you to sign a contract saying you want to be hurt, that if a man is a sadist you won't change him, that as a general rule orgasms don't happen when you just look at someone - but maybe I'm wrong on that one and just missing out!!<br />If I was desperate and stuck on a desert island I would rather have nothing to read than be stuck with these books. I would in fact be happy to download all the reviews instead - they are so much more entertaining and literary than the novel in question - shame on society that this is the best we can do in 2012 - best seller lists all over the world - that says it all really!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is awesome and don't litsen to any one who says it Sucks because it rules and u should totally get it.

I read the reviews for Marla Cilley's book.<br />I was hooked and ordered it. I am motivated, excited and feeling quite proud of myself for following her advice on routines and habits to achieve a sense of peace in the home. This book, takes you by your hand and step by step teaches you to \\"bless\\" your home...using her methods will change your life is such a positive way. My adult daughter has been telling other family members how wonderful the house looks!! I feel so proud after years of feeling so ashamed of the clutter/disorganization. I'm telling friends and family about it! I wish I had known about this book a long time ago.  Thank you Marla!!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, I read it so fast I had to go back and read it again slowly the second time.  It was fun being about to download and read all three on the Kindle.
0345803485|1.0|after reading some reviews, good and bad, I think I'll take the book back and get something else for a summer read.  i've read this kind of stuff before, and it had better be pretty good to keep me interested.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun but a lot of the upgrades are expensive so you have to wait a long time inbetween to do them.
B0076D0D8S|1.0|Bought this DVD thinking it was a real movie. However, the supposed DVD will not play in a DVD player. It only plays on the computer. Upon further inspection the movie has a homemade sticker label. It is very evident that this movie was copied onto a CD instead of a DVD. Which leads me to believe that this was illegally copied and sold as real. I am very unhappy as I have always trusted Amazon to sell quality items.
0345803485|4.0|What a fantastic story! This book is very enticing. I couldn't put it down. I will be honest and say there were certain parts that resembled The Twighlight Saga, but the passion, detail and erotica was very well played out.  If you can ignore some grammar mistakes and overuse of words, this book is amazing!
B007P6VLR8|4.0|I am an avid avid avid SP fan. I love this album. I give it a four because it isn't as sonically epic as Siamese Dream but I do LOVE the album.<br /><br />In it Corgan brings his emotionally mature approach to the music while carefully paying attention to tone and creating warmth within each song. I LOVE when Corgan goes hard (Quiet and Geek USA among the epics) and when he is psychedelic (Cherub Rock, Silverfork) but the only song that hits those categories would be the lead track. This album is not created by a young man searching to dominate with the power of his ability to bring force and mind numbingly intense guitar work but by a mature musician as he travels through life. Much like the other great musicians of previous decades he has abandoned some of the things that led him to be famous as he explores sonically and presumably as he explores the meaning of life itself.<br /><br />For some of the people who are not adept enough to know this already you can listen to most of the tracks on Youtube if you look them up. And if you don't like the offering then you are not obligated to buy. I was not obligated to buy either but I did for two reasons: sonic quality and to support my favorite artist.<br /><br />I have been used to much of the album since October when SP toured and greatly appreciate some of the modifications they gave to the songs from the performance (Quasar, Panopticon, Oceania, Pale Horse) but most especially love Quasar. That said I am greatly happy to hear the additions to the album of Inkless and Wildflower. These are standouts for me.
0307891402|5.0|There is so much in this game that it is good to have a guide.  I like the fold out map but the online map is better.  I don't have to worry about tearing or loosing the fold out map now.  The information that is in the guide is layed out and explained very well.  Just about everything that you need to know is right here.  Everything eles you should be able to get from playing the game.  I got the hard cover addition.  It looks really good on my bookshelf when I am not using it.
B007URCTOG|3.0|The Vow was very predictable.  A newly married couple gets in car accident, she loses memory and doesn't know him.  His quest is to win her back.  The viewer knows the end immediately.  No drama, no suprises, very few laughs. I was disappointed, dull, dull, dull.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|This book over does the meaning of love, its just a porn book for people<br /> who get aroused reading about kinky sex. Surely normal people do not<br />indulge in these practices.

B003L20ICE|4.0|As the 180th review, few will read this.  I liked the film, the plot, the acting, and the general premise of \\"a normal gay/lesbian suburban family\\".<br /><br />What I found fascinating was Annette Bennings' role as the MALE or HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.  What one sees and finds fascinating is 'the maleness' she portrays, no doubt what she sees with all the males she connects with, a womans' view of what men are and their predictable reactions.  She plays the character to perfection, as she is capable of.  The problem is that the images are generic, simplistic, and stereotypical (also wry and humorous).  I could see myself being viewed this way but I didn't feel my maleness captured.  Some women friends, asked what makes a man different from a woman, reply 'a certain perversity to their character, and words similar.  She was 'HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD' trying to play 'MALE'.<br />The greatness of Stepford Wives was the inability of men to be able to craft a 'perfect woman', either version of the film.  The curiosity of this movie, women are unable create the 'perfect male'.<br /><br />Incidentally, I am a white, professional male, 60's, retired, fascinated with the changes in man-woman relationships we've witnessed the last 40 years.

0439023513|4.0|The Hunger Games series is a good original story. The author has given us interesting characters that you genuinely care about. The love triangle presented is a bit more original and different as well. The author's writing style took me a little time to get used to. For me it wasn't bad, just different. As a reader, I tend not to get too upset over editing. I'm more interested in how the author keeps my attention and Ms. Collins did that just fine. However, I felt that the ending was a bit dragged out.  You won't be disappointed in the series.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|48 years I've been a quiet Star Trek fan.  Honestly thought, no more Star Trek themes, movies could top all the past endeavors.  Roddenberry has to be laughing it up in space, he knew Star Trek is forever!!  Amazing, awesome, stellar cast!!  I had just watched William Shatner's documentary of \\"The Captains\\" which is awesome and this enticed me to watch this movie.  Now I am waiting for more, more more!!  Music is great, acting is great, story is great, amazing all the way for me!!  I confess, I watched the movie and then re-watched it again.  So, watch the movie, I will probably watch it again too!!

B007A2O3FO|5.0|The Chimneys of Green Knowe, published in the U.S. as The Treasure of Green Knowe, is the most dramatic and tightly-written of Lucy M. Boston's spooky, atmospheric books for young people. Julian Fellowes, who created Gosford PArk and later Downton Abbey,  wrote and directed this respectful, affectionate adaptation. Like the screen-writer of the first Narnia movie, Fellowes added war-related tension to his framing story. In this case, the new material works well to define the characters and give their story some much-needed forward motion.<br /><br />The acting is uniformly superb, from Maggie Smith and Timothy Spall to the trio of children who carry much of the story. The costumes are gorgeous, and the ancient home on which the Green Knowe books are centered is well-represented by an actual stately home.<br /><br />This movie is not the funny, ribald preteen fare that American movie-makers usually provide, but it should appeal to families who enjoy more thoughtful child-centered stories such as Hugo and The Secret of Roan Inish.

B000AP04MO|1.0|British comedy drama film directed by Stanley Donen and starring Albert Finney and Audrey Hepburn. Written by Frederic Raphael, music by Henry Mancini, cinematography by Christopher Challis. Two for the Road is a 1967 film is about an architect and his wife who examine their twelve-year relationship while on a road trip to Southern France. The film was somewhat experimental for its time because the story is told in a non-linear fashion, with scenes from the latter stages of the relationship juxtaposed with those from its beginning. (After any number of silly turbulences-RC), the couple cross the border from France into Italy. This is new ground for them as well as for the audience, signalling a move beyond the old issues into a more mature future.<br /><br />Budget $4 million - Box office $12,000,000 - $3,500,000 (rentals).<br /><br />Filming locations (all In France): Beauvallon, Drôme - Cap Val&eacute;ry - Château de Chantilly, Chantilly, Oise - French Riviera, Alpes-Maritimes - Grimaud, Var - La Colle-sur-Loup, Alpes-Maritimes - Nice - Paris - Port de Nice, Alpes-Maritimes (ferry disembarkment sequence)  - Ramatuelle, Var (Dalbret villa scenes) - Restaurant Leï Mouscardins, Rue Portalet, Saint-Tropez, Var - Saint-Tropez - Studios de la Victorine, Nice (studio) - &Eacute;tangs de Commelles, Coye-la-Forêt, Oise.<br /><br />Cars featured in the film being driven by the couple include a white Mercedes-Benz 230SL roadster, an MG TD, a Triumph Herald, a VW Microbus, and a Ford Country Squire.<br /><br />Cast Audrey Hepburn as Joanna 'Jo' Wallace, Albert Finney as Mark Wallace, Eleanor Bron as Cathy Maxwell-Manchester born Seligman, William Daniels as Howard 'Howie' Maxwell-Manchester, Gabrielle Middleton as Ruth 'Ruthie' Maxwell-Manchester, Claude Dauphin as Maurice Dalbret, Nadia Gray as Françoise Dalbret, Georges Descri&egrave;res as David, Jacqueline Bisset as Jackie, Judy Cornwell as Pa, Ir&egrave;ne Hilda as Yvonne de Flora, Leo Penn as Morrie Goetz, Dominique Joos as Sylvia Obino, Olga Georges-Picot as Joanna's Touring Friend.<br /><br />The above collage, from Wikipedia press material, gives you the ingredients with which Mr Donen has made another film in Europe.

The small, chubby, minimalistically-drawn preschool-aged main character lives on a blank page, but Harold¡¯s world doesn¡¯t stay empty for long. Harold creates everything he wants, needs, and imagines with a few deftly-drawn strokes of his purple crayon, including: A moon, a sidewalk, an apple tree, a monster, nine kinds of pie, and ¡ª finally ¡ª a spare but snug bed next to a window, through which shines Harold¡¯s companion, the moon. The absence of adults appeals to many preschool-aged children who tend to be more focused on themselves, their peers, and imaginary play.<br /><br />Another favorite with a boy who kicks butt: Tikki Tikki Tembo, by Arlene Rosell. In this retelling of a Chinese folk tale, a humble younger son plays perpetual second fiddle to his first-born brother with the impossibly long ¡ª but irresistibly catchy ¡ª name that children love reciting over and over and over again. Everything changes when the first son falls down a well and the younger brother must find help!

B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I've been a huge Linkin Park fan since the beginning and have loved everything they've put out. The first two albums are the most memorable and I go back to them a lot but M2M and ATS don't get as much rotation these days like they did when I first bought them. Still loved them but not something I need to listen to. Living Things is what most fans were expecting after Meteora. It's energetic, in your face and captures the best of all of LPs styles. I love it. I'll be Gone and Lost in the Echo are two of their best songs hands down.
0307474259|5.0|We've been duped. All of us. Well-intentioned people have told us that if we just eat fewer calories than we burn, we'll lose weight. In fact, I know people who've used that technique successfully. But this book explains the science behind why counting calories is pointless, and reducing carbohydrates is the only way to lose weight. (If you're smart about counting calories, you probably reduce sugar first, which is why it seems to work to reduce calories.) If you're willing to take my word for it, go buy Dr. Atkins or your favorite high-fat, low-carb diet book; otherwise read this book first.<br /><br />\\"Why We Get Fat: And What To Do About It\\" is the book I was kind-of hoping the author's \\"[[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health]]\\" would be, but I'm actually glad they're separate books. If you've already read GCBC, then you only need to read the last chapter and FAQ section of WWGF; otherwise it's all the same information, but shorter, with more analogies and fewer researchers' names, and presented with conclusion first and arguments after. However, I'm what they call a \\"high convincer,\\" so I appreciated the detail of GCBC (on both the science and history) that explains how we came to believe things that aren't, as much as science can say it, true. Most people don't need that level of detail and will be fine reading this one. Taubes does fall prey a little to the idea that we should get this message out even though more research is going on -- the very same notion for which he criticizes the low-fat folks, who did a lot of harm by deciding on an answer before they did the research -- but I'll forgive him because he acknowledges it, and because the science of the body is uncontroversial and the science about diet is both consistent so far and resolves a lot of the seeming paradoxes in the previous research.<br /><br />On the one hand, I'm glad that I now understand why the Atkins diet works. On the other hand, without bread and chocolate, life isn't worth living, so I know I won't be able to go completely carb-free (although most people don't have to do that except to start out the diet). Back to the first hand, I really would like to avoid cancer, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and the host of other \\"diseases of civilization\\" that are beyond reasonable doubt associated with the increased intake of white flour, white sugar and white rice that comprises so much of the modern Western diet. Chocolate cake now or Alzheimer's later? It's a conundrum, honestly -- a test of the conscious mind and delayed gratification over the sugar craving. For me, so far sugar is winning, but at least I feel guilty about the right things now.<br /><br />I hope people read this book, so that we can stop arguing about things that are pretty well proven false now (e.g., high-carb diets are good for you) and start figuring out how we can turn around the epidemic of diseases that's plaguing our nation. In fact, this book sticks to its title thesis admirably well. I wish it had emphasized the association of refined carbohydrates with \\"Western\\" diseases even more, so that lean folks would know the message is for them, too.other hand, without bread and chocolate, life isn't worth living, so I know I won't be able to go completely carb-free (although most people don't have to do that except to start out the diet).

B00004R99U|3.0|This film was apparently done for television and the format is definitely that of television  in the late 1990s. This implies the picture cannot be as rich as on a silver screen, and special effects have to be more modest. It also implies a lot of close-up images and slower movement.<br /><br />The film though is interesting in all the twists it introduces in the story.<br /><br />The meeting with John Rolfe in America is purely formal and it is the fact that Powhatan, her father, decides to send her on a diplomatic mission in England that she is going to travel with John Rolfe and actually have a rather close and yet distant connection.<br /><br />In fact John Rolfe is going to fall in love with her little by little and then she will fall in love with him at the same pace. The adventures in London have nothing to do with reality. She is at first a success at the Hunt Ball, but she is frightened and horrified by the treatment of a bear in some magic show presented to the King by Ratcliffe who is waiting for Pocahontas' mission to fail in order to take the lead of an armada that is already ready to sail to Virginia in order to exterminate the savages. Ratcliffe wants his vengeance.<br /><br />She is then sent to the Tower to be executed on the following day. But then John Smith gets John Rolfe on a salvaging mission to the Tower. Pocahontas discovers John Smith and her old friendship is reactivated but for no avail because what John Smith proposes is not stability but adventure and Pocahontas wants some kind of stability.<br /><br />They escape from the Tower of London and rush to the admiralship of the armada to stop Ratcliffe. The battle is funny, but without any suspense at all. It is then that she discovers she loves John Rolfe and that her love is answered positively. So they sail to America to live their love story in Virginia.<br /><br />Nothing to do with real story, with her marrying John Rolfe in Jamestown and having a son Thomas there. Nothing to do with her dying in Gravesend and being buried there. This is pure fiction and as such does not help re-evaluating the character. It is pure commercial exploitation of a fertile field and nothing else.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUer dying in Gravesend and being buried there.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book definitely kept my interest. I couldn't put it down. I was very eager to start the next book.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|WALT DISNEY - POCAHONTAS - 1995<br /><br />The film is a perfect animated production and the main two assets are the music and the songs and of course the very dynamic animation. This is particularly true with the Indians who are shown in a realistic way cultivating big fields of Indian corn and tobacco, and fishing. They are not shown hunting though. But they are shown dancing, singing, and at the end of a waR against another tribe, though the prisoners are not shown and there was no war between two Indian tribes without some prisoners, the men for ritual sacrificing, and women and children to become slaves. The best off were the children because they were adopted. That is not shown directly. It will only come later WITH John Smith.<br /><br />The Europeans are shown as what they are, male adventurers with very mixed intentions and a very conflict-ridden social situation. The noble Governor Ratcliffe is a real pest and pain in the back from beginning to end. He is a perfect commander, giving orders but doing nothing, and having only one objective: to find gold by digging, as if digging anywhere in America was supposed to bring gold out of the earth. It is true noble people do not need to have an education since they are born intelligent and they have no concrete practice of what real work is. This is shown in the most obvious and impressive way.<br /><br />John Smith is made the captain of the ship. He is humane and he is able to save a man overboard in the middle of a tempest. He is a discoverer and goes out to meet the Indians, and he meets Pocahontas, the daughter of the chief Powhatan who is seen as a warrior and not an old man. The Europeans are shown a little bit more realistically than usual and they use row-boats to go up and down the river, not Indian canoes, like in most other versions.<br /><br />Pocahontas is shown as a young woman and not a girl, who is adventurous in her own way though at first distant and even fearful. But she accepts contact rather easily and she introduces John Smith to her grand mother Willow, a willow that speaks and gives advice.<br /><br />This meeting of John Smith and Pocahontas is amplified by the meeting of Pocahontas' raccoon and Ratcliffe's pampered dog. This is both charming and funny, how the savage raccoon is so much apter to survive any kind of trouble coming from a civilized dog than the reverse. The third animal here is a humming bird who is the jester of the triad.<br /><br />At this moment Thomas, a young sailor who had followed John on Ratcliffe's order, tries to protect John Smith against Kocoum who had followed Pocahontas, shoots Kocoum dead. Then John Smith, who protects the young chap, is submitted to an ordeal, a path of torture between two lines of Indians hitting him with any bludgeon they may have. He is saved by Pocahontas in extremis. Here the Indian custom is not specified, because of course it is not the case here: a woman who has lost family in a battle can claim a prisoner to replace the dead relative. This is the weak point of the film because Pocahontas' claim is not justified from the Indian point of view. That makes Powhatan weak.<br /><br />But the most important part of the film is the showing of the opposition of two cultures, two visions of the world.<br /><br />Powhatan declares: \\"These white men are dangerous. No one is to go near them.\\" That's pure fear in front of the thunder sticks, the rifles.<br /><br />But then John Smith explains to Pocahontas what follows. \\"We'll show you people how to use this land properly, how to make the most of it.\\" And he retorts to Pocahontas' objection as follows. \\"You say that because you don't know better.\\" And he calls the Indians \\"savages\\" which causes the retreat of Pocahontas. Then he explains his mind. \\"Savage is just a word, a term for people who are uncivilized.\\" That's burning his boat and then sinking the ashes. Pocahontas conclusion is just to the point. Savages are people who are \\"not like you.\\"<br /><br/>And that's when a war starts.<br /><br />The two cultures, Indians and English men, are just the same and they sing the same song about savages, the savages being of course demons on the other side. Powhatan leads the Indian movement as the chief of them when the warriors from other tribes have arrived. Ratcliffe leads the English but for his own narrow-minded, violent, even cruel, and greedy motivations.<br /><br />Grand Mother Willow advises Pocahontas properly, the raccoon brings Jim Smith's compass it had stolen a long time before and that's the dream: a spinning arrow showing the way. Pocahontas takes John Smith with her and they go to Powhatan to stop the war just when the two armies are face to face. Powhatan accepts his daughter's demand. \\"My daughter speaks with the wisdom beyond her years. We've all come here with anger in our hearts, but she's come with courage and understanding. From this day if there's to be more killing, it will not start with me.\\"<br /><br />The fool then is Ratcliffe who tries to shoot Powhatan, but John Smith gets in-between and It is John Smith who is shot. He has to go back to England, to be cured and healed, or to die on the ship taking him to England. That ending is a lot better than going back to England to cure and heal severe burns caused by his dumb smoking next to a bag of gun powder.<br /><br />So what's the meaning of the film? Definitely a call for wisdom in the relations between ethnic groups, a total evacuation of the invasion of Indian territory by Europeans, a discrete allusion to the genocide that was to come later on, a total absence of real commerce between the English and the Indians, the fact that the Europeans do not seem keen on starting survival activities like cultivating the land or hunting properly.<br /><br />The film is in fact entirely transferred from the historical point of view to the sentimental point of view, as a metaphor of the ethnic situation.<br /><br />When John Smith falls in love with Pocahontas and is a prisoner destined to be brained alive or rather brained dead on the following morning he tells Pocahontas: \\"No matter what happens to me, I will always be with you, forever.\\" And when John Smith is being taken to his ship, Pocahontas says: \\"No matter what happens to me, I will always be with you, forever.\\" Perfect echo, perfect metaphor.<br /><br />The animals show the same meaning with Ratcliffe's dog dressed in an Indian cape at the very same moment when Powhatan put his own cape on the wounded John Smith on his stretcher.<br /><br />Moralistic probably but for sure in the trend of the end of the 20th century when, after the Wounded Knee Incident (February 27, 1973), when a full reassessing of the presence and role of Indians and Indian blood in America was started and found its ultimate realization in the presence of Indians and Indian floats on the inaugural parade for President Barack Obama in January 2009.<br /><br />Walt Disney did not create the re-evaluation of Pocahontas, but they sure amplified it.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU/>And that's when a war starts.<br /><br />The two cultures, Indians and English men, are just the same and they sing the same song about savages, the savages being of course demons on the other side.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Ok I had to see what all the big deal was.  REALLY?  It's erotica with a story.  Overall the story is ok.  It kept me entertained.  Why this series is so huge is beyond me?  It's just ok, nothing amazing.  I've read more free kindle books that were better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is really fun and its free.  the only thing is it doesn't tell u how to play each game. but its ok I still enjoy it
1400052181|5.0|An amazing true story of human suffering and survival coupled with detailed medical research and explanations.  The author clearly spent years researching to find the truth.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my mother. She seems to think this film is quite sharp. Would recommend for any fan of the novel.
0141439475|2.0|book came shredded apart, it was a great book however, though, wish it wasn't a puzzle piece when I got it.
B003EYVXYG|5.0|Nothing like a distopian futurescape crafted by one of the world's best horror minds; George Romero. This film explores two classic standpoints, when it comes to zombies: execute or save. Hatfields and McCoys on an island with zombies!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|So this is the weakest book in the trilogy. I liked the simplicity of the first. And the darker undertones of the second. This got a little lost with Katniss also being a little less likeable that she had been.<br />All this being said, if you get this far in the trilogy you will read to the end.
B005FMB8X6|5.0|You know, I really have no idea why I still love this album.  Parts of it are so stuck in the 80s that if I play it around non KC fans they cringe and look at me like I lost my mind.  I don't care, I just love the album. Going to college in the mid-80s where I was introduced to this band, I found myself drawn to not their most popular first album (which I had never heard at the time), but the 70s and 80s groups.  These are the ones that Fripp comments are more popular in the US than Brittan, so maybe that has something to do with it.  USA and Red were my introduction, then, it took a while, but Discipline became one of my favorites.  If you like things a bit off the beaten path and don't mind giving it a few spins, you could like this album, but it's not for everyone.  Now on to the review of the 40th anniversary:    First off you need to understand this in not really a DVD-Video.  The few videos on here are fun to watch, but nothing great.  The focus is the audio, and nothing is going on on-screen while the audio tracks are playing (note, if you have a plasma TV you may want to turn it off so you don't burn the screen).  Do a little research on wiki if you don't understand.    Main feature 5.1 surround:  If you have equipment that's older than a decade you MIGHT have some problems with hearing the surround sound, but it's nothing that a cheap newer DVD player and receiver can't solve. There are two versions of the 5.1, one in lossless MLP format, only playable on expensive DVD-Audio players, and one DTS version that will play on almost everyone's equipment.  Second, I do not have a DVD-Audio player [...] so I have currently only listened to it in the DTS surround.  Don't let the DVD-Audio scare you off.  The DTS sounds fantastic.  The surround field is huge with tons of separation.  The first lyrics in Elephant Talk are jaw dropping when Adrian comes in.  The field is set up with you in the center of the band and them playing around you, so you do need to have quality rear speakers that match your fronts or it's not going to sound right.  Fripp I think is mainly in the rear, Bruford and Tony mainly in L&R with Adrian's solo's bouncing around, but mainly focused in the center.  When Adrian's singing comes in, it's dead center pulled forward some and it sounds like he's right there with you.  Very nice surround mix on par with Dark Side of the Moon IMHO.  Note, only the main album is mixed in 5.1 unlike some of the other 40th anniversary where they mixed some of the bonus tracks in 5.1.  Minor issue.    Stereo from DVD:  Again there are two formats for this, a MLP Lossless in 24 bit/96kHz and a PCM Stereo in 24/48.  As before, the MLP will only play in DVD-Audio players.  The PCM is part of the basic requirements for ALL DVD players, so it will play on ANY DVD player.  If your DVD disc won't play in the DVD player (not the CD player,....HELLO!) then either your equipment is set up incorrectly or you have a bad DVD and send it back for a replacement.  Oh, and make sure you check the Audio Setup and put it to PCM if you're wanting listening to stereo and don't have a surround receiver with DTS.  If you don't have a DTS decoder and put it on DTS, you're going to get nothing.  That's user error, not something wrong with the disc.    Since I don't have a DVD-Audio player, this review is of the PCM stereo, which is also an uncompressed audio format and of slightly better tech specs than CDs (16/48).  All I can say is Steven Wilson is a God.  I haven't listened to much Porcupine Tree (his day job), but he is an outstanding mixer/producer and this album has never sounded better.  Included as extras here for some odd reason are the 30th Anniversary remasters (which were the best sounding up to this point) and you can bounce (albeit slowly in the DVD menus, though you can do it quickly on a PC) from the 2011 mix to the 30th Anniversary.  The difference is astonishing.  Huge sound stage and separation.  Instruments sound crystal clear asthey should and not muffled.  I think I may actually like the 2.0 better than the 5.1, it's that good.  And surprising that Stephen could improve so much over a recent remaster.  Makes me wonder if Fripp has lost too much hearing over the years to really assist in the mixing.  And I'm no technical expert and don't really understand the difference between a \\"remaster\\" and a \\"mix\\", but I'm guessing the mix is much more involved.  The mix IMHO takes nothing away from the original (and doesn't add either), just sounds fantastic.  A great reason alone to buy this even if you have the 30ths.  Again, only the 7 original tracks show up under the heading \\"2011 stereo mix\\".  Not sure if the same care was taken with the bonus tracks.    DVD Extras:  Like I said before, it has the 30th Anniversary issue, including the bonus track of an alternate version of Matte Kudasai, in both MLP 24/96 stereo and PCM Stereo.  In addition to the Matte Kudasai, there are 5 more tracks.  I've only listened to them once.  Kind of interesting, but nothing stands out.  There's also, in PCM stereo (no MLP) \\"Album rough mixes\\".  7 original tracks from the recording sessions that were prepared by the original producer, Rhett Davies.  There's a paragraph in the booklet describing them.  Only listened to a little of that.  Just an interest addition, but doesn't add a lot of value.  Finally we have 3 videos from The Old Grey Whistle Test, a BBC program, from 1982.  They also are interesting, but the quality is not that great.  Good for a watch or two, but not a long term value.  It was interesting to see Fripp sitting (of course sitting) more up front in the lights and actually smiling some!    CD:  And lest we forget, there is a CD included.  It has the 2011 mix of the by Stephen Wilson and three bonus tracks.  No alt version of Matte Kudasai, just an alt version of The Sheltering Sky and Thela Hun Ginjeet and an odd mix of vocal loops that wasn't really needed.  That's only 54 minutes long, so they could have included the couple other DVD bonus tracks and the alt of Matte, but they didn't.  I haven't listened to the CD yet, but I'm sure the quality is similar to the DVD stereo track, i.e. excellent.    Packaging:  I'm only mentioning this due to something I found EXTREMELY annoying.  The only other 40th I own is Red and it has a slightly different CD/DVD holder that actually works.  I have A LOT of trouble getting the discs out and actually slightly cracked the CD already, luckily only in the center and it doesn't effect the playing.  I really liked the 30th LP style better than this as well.  It's a box with an insert that slides out and opens revealing the 2 discs on opposite sides in plastic holders.  The booklet is just thrown in the middle with no pocket to stick it in.  The expected notes from Fripp are included as well as a short narrative by Sid Smith and the usual pictures.    A few interesting things I've figured out:  So you (like most of us) don't have a DVD-Audio player.  Did you know that with the free program Foobar2000 and the also free DVD-Audio plugin (just spend 10 seconds on google and you can find them) you can play the MLP lossless tracks on your PC (sorry mac).  There's also a free win-amp plugin that also works on MediaMonkey.  Additionally, there's a free program called DVD Audio Explorer that will allow you to rip the tracks off of the disc and convert them to lossless flacs at 24/96 (for you personal use, of course).  If you don't have a way to play flacs on your home theater, for the stereo tracks at least, you can rip them from flac to lossless WMAs.  These play on my cheap Sony blu-ray and could play on DVD players that play WMAs.  It takes some work, but there are ways to enjoy the MLP tracks on here without going out and buying a $500 universal player.    It's all talk!
B007MJSQSK|4.0|I hated how fuzzy the picture quality was at times... Other than that it was AN AMAZING MOVIE!! ;) I HIGHLY recommend it!
B007U2ABXM|5.0|Patti Smith is one of those rare people in music, a true poet. Her albums are an exploration of some of the places that her mind has been since the last album, sharing with her fans the journey she has undergone. For those willing to be a fellow traveller, this particular path pays off not in spades, but in harlequin diamonds.<br /><br />The album is bookended by deviations from religion. In the first song, \\"Amerigo,\\" a baptismal priest is himself baptised by nature itself, while in the last song, a visitor to a church turns from prayer to art. In between are songs dedicated to the poet's friends, to a couple of other authors, as well a to a dead pop star whom she's never met. If this all seems too intellectual for you, then you'd probably be better served by seeking elsewhere. However, if you like to be challenged, to have your horizons expanded, then you'll discover that there is a lot to enjoy about this album.<br /><br />This album is a continuation of her last studio album, \\"trampin'.\\" Patti has evolved from her punk rock origins into someone more elegant. \\"This Is The Girl\\" is a hit song waiting to be discovered, and \\"Maria\\" is one of her most gorgeous songs. The overall tone is one of nuance and understatement, deserving of and rewarding by a closer examination.<br /><br />The only flaw, in my opinion, is the inclusion of a Neil Young song. Mr Toung has sent American jobs, at the Lionel Train factory, overseas, and I am of the opinion that, as Woody Guthrie once sang, \\"Us working folks has got to all stick together.\\" Seeing that Patti refers to her art as her \\"work\\" these days, one would think that she would be more sympathetic to her fellow workers. However, one can always burn a copy with the offending number deleted from it, or program their CD player to skip over it.<br /><br />The deluxe version is well-worth the additional expense, containing lyrics and photos (most taken by Patti herself) in a charming book. There is an additional song as well, a celebration of the life she shared with Robert Mapplethorpe, named after the award-winmng book she wrote about it.<br /><br />If you haven't heard anything by her yet, then you'll be better served by purchasing \\"Horses\\" or \\"Outside Society\\" first. However, if you're already a fan, then there's no excuse not to get this, as it's one of the best chapters in the book of her career.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|This is a revision of my original review. It was posted 10 hours ago, and I've already gotten a couple of comments from people who seemed offended that I called it \\"forgettable shouty tripe.\\" One of the commenters asked if I'd even listened to the album more than 3 times before reviewing it. Well, no. I hadn't actually listened to the whole thing even once. LOL.<br /><br />So anyway, I've listened to it all the way through now. 84 times, for those keeping count. I took the day off, went to the stereo store, bought some headphones, and spent the day in a dark room listening to every note before posting this revised review. (Satisfied?)<br /><br />What I can say is that there are a few songs I like on this album. I like Caravan, BU2B, Halo Effect (even if it sounds a lot like Half the World), The Wreckers, and The Garden. I'm willing to give the whole thing some more time. Every Rush album I've ever heard (which is *all of them*, many many times) struck me as kind of \\"bleh\\" the first time I heard it, but they all grew on me eventually. Some stick with me for a long time, and others don't. Which is the main complaint I have against their newer stuff. None of it sticks. Newer Rush isn't as interesting as the older stuff was. None of the albums since Counterparts seem to have the staying power of the older albums. And it's not because I'm some old codger who can't stand modern recording techniques. It's because time seems to have ironed some of the likable quirks out of this band.<br /><br />Anyway, the songs I don't like are the ones where they're rocking harder. It all seems like some kind of un-focused jumble of sound. \\"Headlong Flight\\" has a couple of good moments, but it's kind of forgettable otherwise. \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is... meh. I didn't get it. BU2B2 (not one of louder songs) probably has a reason to exist, but I'm not sure what it is. Is it supposed to be one of those \\"transition\\" pieces like \\"Useful Idiot\\" or \\"-(ions)\\" found on a Tool CD?<br /><br />I'm sticking by my original assertion that Rush seems to now sound like a big-budget Rush cover band who decided to write original songs. They seem to be trying too hard to sound like Rush, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />As always, the musicianship is great. And yes, I'm going to see them when they come to KC, like I have been doing since 1981. Honestly, if you're reading this review, you're a Rush fan anyway, and you've probably already bought the album.

0345803485|1.0|As the title of my review states, this is just further evidence that is not how much or what you know, or even your skills at what you do, but who you know and if you can get the controlling media of whatever it is that you do, on your side. I agree with the review that simply states it how it is. We understand that there's a \\" fantasy\\" level in these writings that is noted, but it really is as if an adolescent wrote this \\"book\\" in her diary instead of doing her homework. I admit, I started reading it at a book store and thought it was a \\"spin off\\" of the actual book and author that got such amazing reviews and best seller etc. so I checked and sure enough, it was the actual book. Just like the others who spoke and posted reviews with sincere honesty, I do not like to write negative reviews, it just feels so counter productive, but imagine if you purchased this online without even reading it a bit in the book store first, you would be quite disappointed and possibly even enraged that such juvenile literary slop lured you into wasting your money on such a silly book that supposedly is a worlds best seller. I would have brought or sent it back stating, \\" you have got to be kidding\\". I'm thinking I would love to have such friends or family or even supporters in such high places, I have a few screen plays I would love to get backing on for a major motion picture. I guess I just suggest you browse through the book at a book store first before you spend money, it's no different than any other purchase really, do a little research before you spend hard earned money.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|not bad, enjoyed playing. of course the game is geared to cost money but can still be played without paying the exorbitant coin and acorn costs.<br />app does become boring as you increase levels. currently at level 50 there are few options left.<br />I have not had issues with the kindle fire.
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I have installed the browser on three (3) Android devices.  Two of them have GPS. On my Toshiba Thrive 10.1, the browser works fine, and GPS location tracking works. On my HTC Sensation 4G (running ICS 4.0.1), the GPS location does not work properly.  It indicates location &quot;Unknown&quot;. I went into settings to enable location tracking, but that does not seem to work. This is a bummer, since I use GPS tracking with search results, and since my location is always &quot;Unknown&quot;, my results are always flawed!
B004HO6I2O|5.0|This is such a great movie.  At first I was a little skeptical with the whole changing places plot being that it has been done so many times in other movies.  However, I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  I laughed the entire way through the movie.  It is definitely not a family movie for kids.  My husband and I love to watch this movie.  Would definitely recommend for a good laugh.
1603427244|5.0|For the topics covered, this book is better than June Hiatt's great work: although Hiatt shows numerous cast-ons and bind-offs, there is no mention of what any of them are best used for.  Montse Stanley, another great knitting reference writer, does tell the purpose and best use of each, but Bestor's photographs add far more clarity to the steps involved in each.<br /><br />This is a very valuable supplement to a knitting reference library.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  It is funny and entertaining.  I have watched it many times and never get tired of it.  I think it is a great movie for both men and women as my husband enjoys it as well.  I would definitely recommend this movie.

B007MNV5WU|2.0|Angry Birds is a fun game so when Angry Birds Space came out I bought it right away. Once I started playing I found myself kind of lost and disappointed. Angry Birds and Angry Birds seasons were able to make me entertained.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I have never written a preview before, so bare with me. I wanted to write a review on this movie, because I feel it is a very very good, underrated movie. The storyline caught my attention from beginning to end; the acting was impeccable and the special effects were very impressive. Epic movie... Great to watch with the family... Even my 5 year old, enjoyed the movie. I am glad I didn't take too serious some of the reviews for this movie and gave it a chance. Great job, Disney!!!
B0058VW36U|4.0|It was fun the first few days but the thing I didn't like was you could skip levels and to open the next box you had to have a certain number of stars. But the game is still a lot of fun and entertaining to play.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Not everyone is going to like this film. If your main objective is entertainment you will probably be bored. I watched it without any exposure to its trailer or any idea at all what it was about and I think that is why it had a big impact on me. I am glad this was the case because it truly was like being led down a blind alley and then being smacked in the face with a reality I did not see coming at all. Personally, I don't tend to run ahead in my mind when I watch a film because I like to focus on every nuance I can and absorb it that way. I don't tend to make up my mind until I have all the facts. Reminds me of the moment in the movie, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" when it becomes apparent the character is schizophrenic and not dealing with reality. I love surprises like that. This movie also reminded me of another film, \\"Doubt\\", though fictional, which left each viewer with an impression distinctly their own and created much interesting conversations afterward. Unfortunately, the more you know about this type of film before you see it, the less likely you will probably appreciate it. I loved it and it hung in my mind for a long time. I particularly liked pondering the definition of a \\"catfish\\" as applied to the story. I also like watching it again with someone new to the film and seeing their reaction. Creates some great conversations, all of which were no doubt some of the film maker's objectives.

1455523003|4.0|This book was fascinating. It started with the slight laugh I got from the title, but then got more serious as I got further into the book. Coming into this book I didn't have very much of an opinion of Mother Teresa, so you might say that I could easily be persuaded one way or the other in this debate. However, I have tried to balance out my intake of information of Mother Teresa, and I hope that now I can write an honest and accurate review of this book.<br /><br />Hitchens starts his expose on Mother Teresa, in a section titled \\"A Miracle,\\" by talking about her interesting and totally accidental rise to fame. Mother Teresa apparently became famous because she was filmed in a dark room with new Kodak film which made the room lighter, and before the truth about the new film could be told, the director of the documentary had spread the story that a miracle had occurred and that Mother Teresa had lit up the room with her presence. Weird.<br /><br />The second part was the most influential when it comes to scarring Mother Teresa's name. Titled \\"Good Works and Heroic Virtues,\\" this section goes into detail about several incidents where Mother Teresa made decisions that just made me cringe. Maybe these were isolated incidents, but Hitchens makes a good case against Mother Teresa and this was probably the defining section of the whole book. Without this section, which contains evidence against the moral and saintly nature of Mother Teresa, this book would be extremely bankrupt of any real hard evidence against Mother Teresa.<br /><br />The last section is titled \\"Ubiquity,\\" which talks about the political side of Mother Teresa, and how she claimed to be above and beyond, or just downright not interested in politics, yet she still used her influence heavily in the realm of politics. I found this section somewhat based of speculation more than proven fact, but it still added to the case against Mother Teresa and was quite worth the paper it was printed on.<br /><br />All in all, I think this was worth my time. However, I still think that Hitchens played this one a little too far out into left field. What I have heard from so many different people who have worked with Mother Teresa directly or indirectly makes it seems like there is more to the story. However, this is certainly worth the read and is a thought provoking book. The only reason it is not 5 stars is because the burden of proof was placed on Hitchens, and I think he dropped the ball a little (only a little!) in the last section.n all, I think this was worth my time.

1469984202|5.0|It's been too long since I've been this enamoured by a book. As a librarian, I made sure that my local libraries will have a copies of this gem. Excellent writing and character development. The kind of book that you forgo popping a movie in for. Can't wait to check out the rest of Howey's books.
B004LROMX4|4.0|The title of my review pretty much sums it up. For those of you who that loved the original 1983 \\"V\\" miniseries and it's follow-up \\"The Final Battle\\", I'd say give this a shot.  While I can't disagree that it is at times a little slowly paced, I never once felt like I was wasting my time watching it. I enjoy the characters, and the actors in their roles.  While it's certainly not breaking any new ground, it is leaps and bounds ahead of the \\"V\\" reboot from a couple years back - not only in story-telling, but also in effects. Quite enjoyable and not easily predictable.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This genre is not my usual choice, but the many five star reviews convinced me to get a copy and I'm so glad I did. What an AMAZING read!

0307591549|5.0|I've been listening to this book as an audiobook from the local library. I like it enough that I'm purchasing the book to read. I'm about halfway through the audiobook.<br /><br />As an audiobook, I was at first annoyed that the author is reading this himself, rather than a professional reader, but I quickly came to appreciate the pleasure the author takes in his work. It really comes through in the tone of his voice and I don't think I would have heard the same book if a professional reader had read it.<br /><br />The information doesn't come across like it's coming out of a text book; it's more conversational and understandable. The techniques he presents are doable, most sound fun. I like that the author talks about the different ways various clients and companies have incorporated the same techniques into their lives and work.<br /><br />I may add more to this when I've finished.
B007VT6QSI|2.0|Now keep in mind I'm not a JB Hater Nor have I ever been. I actually enjoyed My World 1 and 2 and I still go back and listen to some tracks from those albums here and there. I was really rooting for Justin Bieber. I was rooting for him to bring the heat and maybe show us something we haven't seen before. I feel like he has failed, everything you get on this album you can get from somewhere else. Everything on this album I feel like we have already heard before, or it's on the radio today playing. Alot of the songs are very repetitive and just lack any real feeling behind it. All Around THe world, Right Here(featuring drake) Thought of you, Beauty and the Beat(featuring Nicki Minaj) It's all stuff we have heard before.<br /><br />Just repetitive crap(yes i'm saying crap) With no substance. I'm very frustrated because I'm tired of these artist selling out. Just stay true to yourself, let the music speak for itself. I thought justin was one who cared about the music and giving a good product. Now it seems like he's just another artist trying to make a buck by any means and sell out. He sounds like chris brown and usher. Justin Timberlake has 2 great classic albums under his belt full of soul and fresh sounds. Unfortunately justin bieber did not come close to the artistry Justin Timberlake Showed on Justified and Futuresex/Lovesounds. This is just my true honest opinion. That is all.

B0071MV540|3.0|This movie has many elements of other suspense heist movies like Oceans Eleven, with the zany blend you'd expect from Ben Still and Eddie Murphy.  Fun to watch, but leaves you a little empty at the end merely because it's mostly all been done before.  Even a few surprise plot twists leave it at a neutral for me.  Save it for a rainy day on streaming video, but I wouldn't suggest owning the BluRay.

B007P3TMW2|5.0|This movie reminds us of what it must have been like for thousands of families in New York and elsewhere in affected cities on 9/11.  Tom hanks is outstanding as always.  May not be best for very young children but tweens and teens that are now just old enough to understand what happened on that day can develop a deeper understanding of the tragedy and horror without the need for gratuitous replays of the building shots that are constantly aired.  Good movie to watch as a family, or on your own.  Keep some tissues handy.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|When did Disney do George Lucas style films better than George Lucas himself? This movie is everything that we wanted the Star Wars prequels and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to be. It has romance, action, adventure, comedy. It has  incredible Special effects and breathtaking scenes. You can tell how great a story is when you become emotionally invested in the characters. I can only name one character from Avatar(Jake Sully) but I can still remember every main character from John Carter. These characters had life, emotion and they were easy to root for. I gave this movie a 9/10 when it first came out but it just grows on you, and the more you think about it and reflect you just desperately want to go back to barsoom as badly as the main character! here's to hoping we get a sequel. I give this movie a perfect 5 stars!

B007IQWQ88|5.0|First, if you're reading this and contemplating purchasing this set, I'll assume that you're already firmly in the Karajan camp and that you understand why you would want this particular set of recordings. So I'm not going to try to convince you of the excellence of these recordings, and I'll concentrate on some other matters about this release.<br /><br />This release supposedly comprises all the orchestral (that is, non-operatic) recordings the maestro made for DG in the years 1959 - 1970. However, there are some tidbits contained in it that were made later. Just for example, you will get the Stravinsky Apollon Musagete from 1972 and the Strauss E-Flat Horn Concerto from 1973. There are 82 CDs, and each is laid out exactly like the original DG LP release and comes packaged in a reproduction of the LP cover (front and back). The good part of this for me was the walk it gave me down memory lane: I can pull out a recording that I remember buying when I was a teenager, and the new disc looks just the same (except smaller). The down side of this is that, CDs being much smaller than LPs, and me being somewhat older than I was in the 1960s, I can't read the LP cover reproductions without a really serious magnifying glass. Also, if you're short on shelf space, let it be said that the way the discs are packaged isn't very compact: this box eats some space (compare to Brilliant Classics boxes). For a celebratory release like this, I'll forgive that. (By the way, since DG is reproducing LPs, many of the playing times run from about half an hour to forty-five minutes. Had DG changed the layout to take advantage of CD timing, the same content probably could have been squeezed onto about 40 CDs.)<br /><br />There's been some internet buzz recently about which remasters this set contains. Unfortunately, no information on that is given in the booklet, though it does contain the following statement on the back page: \\"Originally released in 2011 by Universal Music Limited, Korea\\".I think, then, that these are what some people refer to as the \\"Korean remasters\\". I really don't have much information on the remastering history of these recordings, so I can't clarify that any further. I did carefully compare the Beethoven 5 from this box with the same recording I have in a DG box that I happen to know was the first CD release of the 60s Beethoven cycle, and I found that it's a different (and therefore later) remaster. I also found the differences to be very slight. These are older recordings, but based on what I've heard so far, sound shouldn't be a problem with this box.<br /><br />The fairly lavish 202 page booklet contains three essays or sets of recollections about the maestro, an HvK chronology, complete track listings, a list of HvK's 1960s opera recordings (that aren't included in this set) and a complete index of all the recordings (English, German, French). The set also contains replicas of DG's recording forms for five of the original LPs, for whatever that's worth. The cardboard box is very sturdy.<br /><br />If, like me, you revere Karajan, this is certainly a treasure trove not to be missed. I'm sure I'll enjoy it for many years.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|The storyline, characters, actors, cinematography....All perfect. Allen should have won the Oscar for Best Picture. Very few films I'd want to own these days, and I'm getting this one!

B004X80QNG|1.0|The specific claim to be compatible with the FranklinCovey has recently been taken out of their description, but I wonder how many folks purchased this app thinking that was what they were getting.<br />I've used the Franklin system for many years, finding its alphanumeric method of labeling task priorities to be unmatched in determining &quot;What Matters Most&quot; in planning my day.  FC explains it in detail on their site, as does Stephen Covey in his books, but for those unfamiliar, instead of labeling priorities simply 1, 2, 3 or !, !!, !!!, etc., it's A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, C3, D4... Much more information in such a tiny space!<br />Six years ago, I bought the FC-branded app for the Pocket PC from FranklinCovey that contained this functionality and worked like a charm.  It was published by THIS company, WebIS, and called Pocket Informant!<br />It can't be that tough to add this simple feature to the android version... what, one or two days of dev time?  Instead, they chose to advertise this functionality without delivering it.  I paid for the android app almost 2 years ago, believing them, but never used it.  I still have it on my phone, hoping that one day it would be &quot;upgraded&quot;, but not yet!<br />I've also noticed that this app is running itself every day in the background, sucking up resources, doing what, I don't know.  Inexcusable for a PAID app!

B0052VUNHC|2.0|I thought this book sounded really interesting, the plot line drew me in and seeing it got so many rave reviews I figured it was worth reading. I was unpleasantly surprised. I feel like the summary must have been written about a different book and accidentally got attatched to this one. Abby Abernathy is a good girl who doesn't drink, smoke, and she wears cardigans. Except for the fact that Abby Abernathy drinks regularly, knows members of The Mob, has a professional fake ID from her days as a Vegas swindler, and I'm pretty sure she has exactly one cardigan that she wears in the first couple pages of the book. After that it's nothing but short dresses, high heels and tight low neck shirts. And please, this chick is a 19 year old virgin who knows all the high rollers in Vegas? Riiiight. But she gives it up without a second thought to some dude just to get him to leave her alone. She gets pissed at him over the dumbest things, like him asking if she kissed Parker on her date with him, but it's perfectly okay for him to bring home two chicks from the bar and have sex with both of them a few feet down the hall from her. Totally makes sense. I hated how he pretty much beat some kid to a bloody pulp in the lunch room over nothing and no one even bats an eye. Where are the adults on campus? Isn't anyone concerned about the assaults that occur on a very regular basis? Another thing I hated was the morbid fire scene! Was that really necessary? Killing hundreds of college co-eds for what? Not to mention the fact that police never investigated the reason so many kids were in this building, which was to attend an underground fight, and Travis was never arrested on criminal charges for being part of the reason so many people died. Oh no, instead they are remarkabley un-affected by the death of their peers and decide to fly to Vegas and get married. Honestly this book was more than a little nauseating, but I gave it two stars because I did find little bits of wittiness that made me laugh out loud. I feel like it could be a great book, but it needs some major work. Is it worth the $2.99? Maybe not. I might pay 99 cents for it, but anything over that is robbery.me laugh out loud.

B00785P2QC|4.0|this game is pretty fun. similar to a simcity type game. a couple things that are frustrating is the waiting time for the game to load and to get the city form things you need to expand and do many things are pain to get without spending real money to buy them. there needs to be more ways to get them without having to spend real money. like trading coins for them.
B0001I55SS|4.0|Back in 1979, The Black Hole was the 21st highest grossing film of the year.  The reviews were mixed.  It received 2 Oscar nominations:  Best Visual Effects & Best Cinematography (it lost the FX award to Alien, & the cinematography award went to Apocalypse Now).<br /><br />I have always held a certain fondness for this film, even though it isn't one of the best sci-fi movies ever made.  My biggest problem with it is the curiously distant performances by most of the cast.  They are a cold and detached group as a whole.  The worst of the lot is Anthony Perkins as Dr. Alex Durant.  He is utterly removed, totally apathetic from everything and everyone in this film (even in his biggest scene).  The one who gives the most human performance is Maximilian Schell as Dr. Hans Reinhardt, the resident madman.  It probably didn't help that they were saddled with a barebones plot manufactured by 4 writers.  This could easily have been an episode of a TV series.  There was no attempt to elaborate on any of the elements in the story, even when they divulged some pretty intriguing secrets.  Everything was rushed, no time to linger, just grab the girl and leave.  If it wasn't for that fantastic meteor storm, there wouldn't be much to boast about.  It didn't help that they liberally \\"borrowed\\" plot points from better films.  I also wished they had designed the 2 floating robots better, they were barely more than cartoons, readymade toys.  But for all that, I love the look of this film, especially in widescreen.  It is elegant and visually sophisticated (except for those 2 roly-poly robots).  I've never forgotten the image of that enormous meteor tearing through the space ship Cygnus.  Spectacular.  I hope it's slated for release on Blu-ray soon.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I usually read non-fiction but decided to read this fiction book that all my co-workers are reading.  This book is very easy reading and moves quickly through the story.  I did enjoy the book and am now on the second one.  I think any woman that reads this book will certainly enjoy it. Once you start the book, it is hard to put down.  You want to find out what happens next.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|If you are ever planning to visit North Korea, don't! This was an amazing story and oh so sad. Really makes one appreciate living here in the good 'ol USA. Excellent book about a country that values no life under a dictatorship. A must read to enlighten those not familiar with North Korea. A real eye opener.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire has been a free game on computers since the beginning of computing And yes this game is free but Everytime you deal a new hand you see a new ad. This becomes irritating and ruins the immersive quality of the game. This is not cool... This makes me wonder if the game maker made the game to make the game or to make money. Show us you made the game to make the game and reduce the number of ads in the game. As for gameplay this is a solid solitaire game
B000SX9IXO|5.0|The Band remains my favorite musical group after all this time.  It sings the lasting sorrow and anger of the losers in a war of necessity from which this country has never recovered.  The music and the lyrics go straight to the heart even of those like me who think that slavery was the worst atrocity this country ever perpetrated.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is fun because you can play with other players. It is a bit of a challenge especially when some of the words are ones you have never seen before

B0055PGUYU|5.0|This fantastic book authored by a prizewinning writer from the NY Times was a page turner that kept me up until 2 AM finishing it. It is a psychology book that is built with the structure of numerous intriguing journalistic stories. These stories cover a wide range of personal habits, organizational habits, and societal habits. It brought to sharp focus how central habits are to our existence, how keystone habits can ripple out and effect many other habits and parts of our lives. We can control habits to help us improve, but can also be allowed to be controlled by them at our peril. This book built a new lens in my mind through which I can see and understand more clearly the automatic behaviors of places I've worked, people I know, and even myself. I read a library copy of this book, but it was so good that I am buying a copy to reread and reference in the future. I would highly recommend everyone I know to read this thought provoking and potentially life changing book.
B007BVOF8E|2.0|While I cannot fault the actors, I do fault the director, director of photography, and art director. The film was basically in black and black with occasional shades of ochre and tan to indicate that a light had been turned on. Murky scenes - dialogue obscured by irritating soundtrack - massive leaps of faith hoping the viewer can follow what is already a subtle plot line (i.e., in the book). In short, a failed attempt to transform a well-written, complicated book into a two hour film. Stick with the mini-series.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I really enjoy these puzzles.  I first discovered them on paper, but much prefer doing them on my Fire.  I just wish there were more of these apps available for the Fire.  I see others on Amazon, but they are for other Kindles, not the Fire.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|its really fun. its actually has paranormal activity. I love it. its really fun I played it for hours!! Its very very fun.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My teenage daughter requested this movie and so, as her grades were very good this year in school, we got it for her.  She absolutely loved it. My wife and I also enjoyed it very much even though we'd seen it several years ago. A bit quirky and not not what your average american audience would generally like, but give it a try.
1568363931|5.0|Lovely quick book. Easy to make appropriate changes for vegan/vegetarian recipes, or jump start creative juices for your own bento creations. Would recommend this for any beginner, and it's super amazing for the price.

0446573019|3.0|OK, for the important disclosure: I am not a David Baldacci fan. I find the one or two books I read (Camel Club: tolerable) I found them tedious. So why read one more? Desperation! Need some book that is a thrill read. So tried this. Puller has shades of Jack Reacher, but he talks too much and unlike the former carries a whole lot of paraphernalia with him, including a gun and a spade!<br />Sgt. Cole could have been a more interesting character but she is totally weighed down by her inane conversations. 'You suspected my sister, and now my brother!' Come on, Puller is merely trying to get some information. Roger Trant is a complete caricature. Rich and fat, there is no verisimilitude in the description. The plot is labyrinthine and moves as fast as an aged overfed python. Unlike some of Jack Reacher's sexual escapades, which at least breaks the mold, Puller is totally inhibited. Imagine, he has some really hot news and goes to Cole's bedroom (she had invited him to stay in her house), and sits by the bed. What are you doing in my bedroom?' she says.<br />I was just watching you sleep, you looked so peaceful. I am not quoting exactly but you get the picture. And she gives him coffee, in the bedroom? The next words are something like, now get out of my bedroom so I can dress.<br />Such an opportunity lost for a romantic interlude.<br />But a lot of patriotic statements, good but oh so corny!<br />Not bad for a summer read but there are better ones available.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|This is a classic NYC gang movie set before the blatant use of firearms. It's a little dated and a little Hollywood, but it's got a solid theme and plot. The tale is an old viking story set in a modern city. This movie is full of characters and good acting. Despite some moments of awkwardness, this movie pretty much feels natural for the time and it sucks you in. Don't take it too seriously, just go along for the ride.
B000IDGDPA|5.0|This was an awesome movie. I love the older 1920's 1930's movie's anyway but this had such a moving story-line. It really kept me intrigued. I did not want it to end. And Helen Hunt was fantastic!!!
B002RRN952|4.0|Visually and action wise, okay. This is an obligatory part of the series - the problem is that it showed in the directing and script. I think one key part of the plot revealed itself a little soon and tensions could have run a lot higher throughout. The original is still the best. This kind of movie really demands to be taken seriously, although that is probably a little difficult after they botched the sequel to the first installment with that goofy stoned kid, lazy directing, and half baked cheesy lines. It's a shame since the story is a postulation of things soon to come. (If you scoffed at that last comment, look up the word postulate). It really should have been treated with more reverence. Getting around in this wreckage of a fantasy world is too easy. They could have shown off more of the Jeep's capabilities and the effort needed to make it through some areas. It lacked a journey and was more just snapshots of events. Still decent though if you've at least seen the first one.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing! exspecaily if you get enough coins to download other characters! the only down aboit this game is that it freezs up.
B007Q476KU|4.0|I am far from being a Spielberg fan, but this is a pretty good movie. Compared to most of the awful stuff out there, this is solid family entertainment that will even have you cheering a little. 4 Stars for all time, 5 for this year. See it.

B006ZZANG0|1.0|I've always thought of Rufus's performance as hit or miss, but this album seems to showcase the fact that he can write, but not perform.  The songs aren't so bad themselves, but it's the droopy, slurry style of singing that kinda ruins it for me.  I think they would sound a lot stronger if they were performed with confidence, rather than sung from a drunk waking up on the sidewalk.
1582701709|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a young Asian person.  His father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, the book gave him a lot of peace.<br /><br />I myself shortly after I met him was diagnosed with breast cancer now this little book is my bible....<br /><br />Thank you...
B0081ISUOG|5.0|I was looking for an app that did simple but flexible time-tracking and initially installed the free version of this app. It does everything I need it to do and has tons of display options. There's a feature to prevent your device from going to sleep while it's running which is nice. It's so well-done I bought the paid version to support the developer. Thanks!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|So far, the story is good, the writing works well, and I'm being pulled through the plot quickly.  Then the information on the .22 'entry and exit wounds' came up.  Here's some advice to authors - if you don't have a clue about firearms (it's a .22 caliber, not a .22 gauge for one) then find somebody who does and ask.  Ok - I lost track of the number of cliche' moments in this book, and the number of inaccuracies.  I will say it's a decent read in terms of grabbing the readers' attention, but I twitch every time I read something that is glaringly wrong in the details. Despite that comment, I will continue to read Lee Child's other books over time, because the man has talent.
B007SGM084|1.0|I agree that the cost has stopped me from buying and reading this trilogy.  I thought books were a little cheaper using the Kindle.  That was the whole reason I brought the Kindle.  My two cents.
B00881VLCE|2.0|This game is okay for someone who doesn't mind limited puzzle to choose from.  To get more you need money but if you just want the basics its great :)
030758836X|5.0|READ THIS BOOK...i am completely blown away by it...after reading about 40 pages i had literal nightmares that were like scenes from the book...it will totally consume and obsess you...i can't get over how diabolical the plot is, especially when you look at the author photo of gillian flynn - who looks like a sweet kindergarten teacher...she obviously has a dark side!!!  i have just ordered her 2 previous books because i love her style of writing and her imagination.  SPOILER AHEAD...this book makes 'the bad seed's' rhoda penmark look like rebecca of sunnybrook farm...there so many twists and turns - i read the book frequently saying out loud - o my god....and wtf????  it is scenes from a marriage of sociopaths...READ THIS BOOK!!!

B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoy playing this game. Pop ups are irritating. and interrupt the game.  There should be an option to block these pop ups.  But other than that game is enjoyable.
0345457692|5.0|A little more violent than I like, but no gratuitous violence, in a hard-hitting, fast-paced story.  Uploaded consciousness, societal effects of longevity, and the nature of personhood are all covered in the first of a series. Hard to put down once you're 30 pages in.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I seriously can't understand what all the hype is about. The writing is cringeworthingly terrible, and frankly I find Good Housekeeping sexier than this drivel. The plot and the characters are boring, unbelievable and unlikable. I don't think I'll be able to finish this book.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I had read some reviews on here proclaiming this to be Rush's best album ever.  I thought that was high praise, indeed, and impossible considering the classics of their past.  I've since listened to it repeatedly, and honestly, I love it a little more with each listen.  This is brilliant and beautiful and engaging and hypnotic.  Think of your favorite rock albums that just you just love to listen to over and over - they never get old for you.  This is certainly one of those instant masterpiece type of albums, and I can't imagine how any Rush fan can possibly be disappointed in it.  As far as their best album ever, I cannot go that high.  Their best is and always be the incomparable Moving Pictures.  It is an immovable force and deserves recognition as their magnum opus.  But I will go so far as to easily put Clockwork Angels in my top five.  I'd probably place it third, behind Moving Pictures and Grace Under Pressure, and ahead of Power Windows and Permanent Waves (yes, I do love 80's Rush.)  This album just flows so nicely (as it should, being a story-telling concept album) and listeners are just carried along by the genius of both the story and the melody.  My absolute favorites on here are Caravan, BU2B and The Anarchist.  Right behind those are Headlong Flight, Carnies, the title track and Wish Them Well.  Congratulations to Rush for silencing any critics who think this band's time is past.  Rush is eternal.
0345803485|4.0|This book is a great summer read. I am a new mom and was able to read all three while being interrupted yet I still could follow.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|The headset is shoddy. The wires that transmit the signals are so thin any standard use will cause them to short out within months. The first set I bought I sent back for warranty and in all fairness it was honored promptly but the second set failed as well, and failed with even more extreme care being used. The headpiece will snap if you try and remove it horizontally as opposed to vertically (IE pull a earpiece out off your ear as opposed to sliding it up your ear and off your head).<br /><br />I'm taking the loss as I voided my warranty opening the control box to see precisely what was causing the problem. As stated the connecting wires for voice and sound are so thin and cheaply protected from movement the slightest force (the act of turning your head side to side or such) will cause the spiderweb thin wire to fray and short.<br /><br />Avoid this headset like the plague its a piece of crap. It advertises itself as a gaming headset but can not withstand the rigors of casual use much less gaming.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Outliers is full of interesting information that you want to read. It is an interesting way of thinking about the world, purely through looking at every little thing and how it contributes to the greater whole. In this case we are talking about how every thing contributes to genius's, asian's being good at math. You get the idea.<br /><br />And now for the personal.<br /><br />It just struck a nerve within me that told me that if I didn't have 10,000 hours experience in whatever vocation I chose then it wouldn't matter. I wouldn't be as skilled as the rest.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Good graphics, but sometimes it is tough to determine tile levels for availability.  Completely met my expectations.  I would def recommend for someone who is just looking to pass time...
B00846REIS|2.0|While it was an interesting read, the characters are all too similar. A HUGE C.E.O., Gideon Cross (Christian Grey's initials backwards) falls for a pretty girl who finds herself attracted to him, but knows that there are underlying issues that need to be worked on for them to be happy. It was a pretty good read, but it left me feeling incomplete because it just ends, abruptly.
0345803507|5.0|These three books in this trilogy are fantastic.  I had no idea they would be so readable.  I loved all of them and hate that there isn't a fourth to read.  Interesting from the first word, and the last book is more a love story than anything.  Purely wonderful.
B007UXSDYU|2.0|The whole nuclear war aftermath genre has been done before; The Day After, Testament, and Threads. All these movies showed us in graphic and frightening detail the immediate and after effects of a nuclear exchange, particulary on the surviving population. So The Divide is nothing new. This dosen't make it a bad movie to watch as far as acting quality and atmosphere are concerned, however, it dosen't offer us anything new over story lines either. It rips off the movies I've just mentioned, only the The Divide takes place in a basement the entire time, and the characters are very unlikable. The opening scenes show us New York city getting decimated by a barage of nuclear warheads. As the bombs are raining down, a lucky(or unlucky) few manage to make it into their apartment building's basement just in time to escape the blasts. From this point on you don't need a crystle ball or alot of forsight for that matter, to tell you that things are not going to work out very well for the surviving few, and will most likley end extremely violently. As far as a movie portraying the dark side of human nature goes, The Divide does well, but other then that there's nothing else to it.
B005IQZB14|3.0|This book was \\"OK\\".  Kind of dragged on in some places.  Humor was good in the beginning.  Some spots unbelievable.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Excellent follow-up.  Leaves you wanting to know more about Salander, cheering her on and hoping she will be accepted for who she is.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I bought this headset about a month ago and have already begun to experience problems. The wireless is constantly resetting itself,even while I'm sitting right next to my computer. Occasionally it will get to the point where it resets multiple times within a few minutes! I even had problems with my computer not picking up that it was plugged into the usb port on more than one occasion.    The product itself was fantastic for the first couple of days. The range worked even while I was on different floors of my house. The headphones themselves are very comfortable and the automatic mute of the mic when it's pushed up is great. It would be a fantastic product if it continued to work this way for more than two days.    To make matters worse, I had an accident with the wireless usb. The poor thing ended up snapping in half and coming apart! I was hoping something like this would be covered in the warranty but sadly accidents are not covered. I suggest to anyone who is still considering buying this headset that they find a warranty that covers everything to go along with the headset. Here's a link to the warranty information on Logitech's website:   [...]  Don't end up out 100 dollars like me!

B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a very fun and heart racing game that others will truly enjoy . I know that the first time you play Temple Run you will not be able to put it down. If you decide to get the game which you should I hope you enjoy.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I really like this movie.  Johnny Depp is amazing, and in this movie he plays an ordinary guy for a change, and Angelina Jolie is just fabulous.  I had to watch it twice just to be sure I had really seen what I thought I had seen.  It is playful yet intense, with lots of questions, lots of action and lots of surprises.  You're not sure until the end just who - no, I won't give it away, you just have to see it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just like super mario! super funn, addicting &amp; hella easy :). its the best free game app i have downloaded on my kindle
B0015DROBO|5.0|My daugther love this book, I bougth a kindle for her some time ago and she is so happy with it, we rented the movie two weeks, ago and she wanted to read the book,she said that the book is better than the movie, I don't know, personally I liked the movie, anyway she will buy the book number 2, and consequently the number 3.<br />Thanks Amazon.
B007N85ZXY|4.0|I was very skeptic of this album so much in fact I did not buy it until I heard a few tracks.  I have pretty much own Neil's complete catalog and I have to admit this is pretty good stuff. Classic Crazy Horse sound.  Neil and Co. made these songs their own.  Well worth $10.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|Not being familiar with author Nick Hornby's writing, I had no idea what to expect with his new Kindle Single \\"Everyone's Reading Bastard.\\" But the story was funny, in a sometimes painful sort of way. Having gone through a divorce many years ago, I know how rancorous and messy they can be. Charlie and Elaine's divorce looked like it might be fairly clean, but then Elaine capitalized on her writing ability to eviscerate defenseless Charlie in her weekly newspaper column, \\"Bastard.\\" Suddenly, Charlie was a notorious, reviled celebrity - even his own mother turned on him after reading Elaine's revelations.<br /><br />Eventually, Elaine crossed the line with some of her disclosures about Charlie, and it seemed like the public was turning against her. But knowing human nature, Elaine recovered quickly and continued her tirade against hapless Charlie. Charlie knew it was bad when Twitter was \\"trending\\" him!<br /><br />\\"Everyone's Reading Bastard\\" is a great example of the Kindle Singles format. I can imagine the story being expanded into a novel-length work, but keeping the story short kept it crisp and fast-paced and very funny.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. It is so very additive. My daughter downloaded it and I just want to try it and have been hooked every since.
0307957934|3.0|This is a good book. It is well written and suspenseful. It also tracks very close to a much better book: Daemon by Daniel Suarez. Both are page turners about AI programs that escape human control and start to change the larger world. Other reviewers have mentioned HAL, the computer in 2001: as another comparison. That's true, but further much further off. Stories in this vein, like Frankenstein, have been around for ages.<br /><br />The similarities between Harris's computerized villain and Suarez's are too numerous for comfort. Both disrupt financial markets for their own gain, kill people by controlling smart buildings, and use spoofed email to hire unwitting human accomplices.<br /><br />I wouldn't mind the cribbing except 'The Fear Index' never exploits these ideas as well as 'Daemon' does. You spend 3/4 of the book not knowing exactly who's doing what. Up to that point it's very much like the Micheal Douglas movie 'The Game.' Pure psychological thriller. Then the last part of 'Fear Index' was such a letdown. Just holding the book you can tell there aren't enough pages remaining to properly develop it.<br /><br />Suarez's Daemon is never hidden. The situation is perfectly clear: distributed AI on the loose causing trouble. Daemon is so great because it is so outlandish and plausible at the same time. Suarez is very gifted with technical details and writes with a lot of joy. The story builds through Daemon and keeps building to a powerhouse ending in the sequel Freedom(TM). These books anticipate Google Glasses, the US's recent efforts at super advanced computer warfare, semi-autonomous drones, and much more.<br /><br />There is a major difference in tone between these books, though. A lot of people might find Daemon offensive. It is garish and loud. It goes much further than you think it will. The best comparison I can think of is that Suarez crafts a monster truck that tears things up. Harris responds with a pencil drawing of the same. This reminds me of a reporter's question to George Clooney on why he wanted to do a remake of Ocean's Eleven. Clooney's response was that the original wasn't great, and everybody involved knew they could do better. 'The Fear Index' is exactly the opposite: a big step down.

0345803485|1.0|I got this series wanting to know what the big deal about them was. I am still trying to figure that out. These books are very amateurishly written and the author is very unimaginative. The characters are very difficult to care about. Ana is so spineless that she pretty much is a submissive going in to the relationship. Whenever she gets angry and confronts Christian, all he has to do is 'turn on the charm' and she turns into a jellyfish and willing to give in to everything and anything he wants.<br />Then there is the author's bad (very bad) habit of repeating dialogue throughout the whole book. Almost every single conversation between Christian and Ana are the same. VERBATIM. And it continues through all three books. Almost as if she just copy/pasted her dialogue sections.<br />The problems with these books can be complained about for a very long time. There are many criticisms I have about these books and I could run out of space that is given to me. Let's just list main issues:<br />1. Ana is a spineless woman and is a horrible role-model for other women. Gives in her 'lover's' demands because he is 'so sexy.' So sickening<br />2. Christian is an extremely repugnant man. He knows the effect he has on Ana and he pretty much exploits it to get what he wants, even after he is 'a better person' towards the end of the series. Disgusting!<br />3. The sex scenes are juvenile and boring. Also (like with the dialogue) they are written pretty much all the same. They do the same things, in the same order, with the same verbage. *SNORE*<br />I came to these books without and opinion of how they would be. I am not being a hater. I just really don't like these books. But, I have to finish them (stupid OCD). I have a very hard time believing that these book are written by a woman in her late 40's and not a bumbling teenage girl.<br />Feel free to make your own opinions. This review states mine!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Very fun. Easy to learn, easy to play, and addicting. Maybe not worth three dollars, but a steal as a sreal the day.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Watched Extended edition of the movie and was not disappointed. It's much longer than theatrical version however the sad thing is that the ending is still the same. Well the movie has a very well written story. I've seen people who claim otherwise, but I enjoyed very much. Great set of actors and nice special effects. Aliens were very well made. Compare to many movies with other aliens where they appear not clearly enough or just one to few times, in this movie you will take a very good look at them and they will appear often. As much as the title can sound hilarious at first, I regret thinking bad about it. It's a very nice entertaining movie that is not just all about action. It will keep you thinking. Of course opinions will be different, but I love this movie! Thank you for making it as it is!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good game. Easy to move around screen. Two suits is good for me. might be better if I could opt for 3 or 4 suits as my skill increases
B001CDZZI6|5.0|A practical book about the essence of organization that combines the theoretical data with concrete results. This book can change your life an the perspective that you have about people.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Never had a problem with it other than the fact that it occasionally won't deal a winning hand. When my android screen was broken, it was convenient that it rotated 360 degrees.
B003L77G10|5.0|My wife and I hooked on this series. Great to watch without advertisements. Nice to do on a quiet nite with a glass of wine.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I played it over a year ago, but saw it in my purchased items and decided to play through it again. Still challenging and even some new levels! No complaints at all!
B000066744|5.0|I loved this movie although the beginning will make you really sad, and if you are like me you will cry! And then the movie goes on to grab at your heartstrings and you will be so attached that you will be yelling at the movie with how it ends.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I am a total audiophile noob but this product is excellent. I am using it with AKG Q701 headphones and my V-Moda Crossfade LP's. The bass sounded good on my crossfade's, but this amp took it to another level of refined, potent bass that doesn't sound muffled either. My friend has the E7, and I can tell already that this one amplifies the bass better. We are going to compare them for fun when he gets back from a trip. Adjusting the treble is nice, but it is vastly underrated that Fiio included the ability to balance the channels. This might be the only portable amp with that capability, and it was smart to incorporate it. The only thing I would have wished for is the L3 being included in the bundle.<br /><br />However I am hoping that the company will release a firmware update that will instruct the screen to turn off after 10-15 seconds. Although the screen is LED, I want to maximize the battery life as much as possible. I emailed the company about it, we will see what they say, but I encourage all of you to email requesting this function so it will expedite the process! Maybe adding the ability to set the time since the screen is large enough wouldn't be a bad idea either :p<br /><br />I am hoping down the line that replacing the battery will be a fairly easy process.<br /><br />Well done Fiio, I am pleased to see this flagship model for portable amps, and hope that you guys will continue to innovate your products.
0792164903|5.0|I just love movies with Johnny Depp, especially when they're directed by Tim Burton. This movie has just the right mix of gore and humor to suit anyone's needs.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|This app is awful.  All you do is combine things.  I got this app for free and it is not even worth that! You would have to pay me to play this... it is AWFUL!!!!!
0783225482|5.0|I just love this movie! It takes a twist on the notion of being young and beautiful forever! Also, be careful what you wish for!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|love this game. spending alot of time on this game. very addictive.  using on a rooted nook tablet, so have a big screen<br />?
B00008DDXL|5.0|Who doesn't love a Harry Potter film? This series will never go out of style! I have watched this so many times I can quote it almost all the way through now!
B007XNAQLA|5.0|Professional reviewers are raving about this (version of the) band and this release ... understandably so. Read those reviews if you want, I'll keep my review brief.<br /><br />I saw RTF perform in September of 2011 in San Francisco and was mesmerized! I therefore expected nothing less from this release. And they do not disappoint. If you're a fan of jazz fusion, JLP and/or RTF, then you will truly enjoy this release. The mixing and production, especially given that this is a live recording, is also very well done.
B000062TU1|5.0|This is where the magic began, the first Harry Potter film. This series will never go out of style! I have watched this so many times I can quote it all the way through!
B005LAIHSG|2.0|OK, the queen was not bad, the forest was interesting.  That being said, the angst was so thick you could cut it with a knife.  The end was so poorly done and so flat faced that it reduced my review a star for just those few minutes.  The story was so predictable that it actually put me to sleep (in the theater, not even comfortable chairs).  I have to say, unless you are a twilight fan, flee from this movie, it is a one watch movie at best.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|This is another classic Tim Burton film, remarkably without Johnny Depp. I love to just watch this movie over and over all the time!
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because everyone was talking about it. I don't get why people think this is anything special. Maybe if you've never read any romance novels or you've never looked up free sexy stories online, then this book will be awesome for you. Also this book goes along with the sexist/uneducated stereotypes of the \\"screwed up\\" BDSM lifestyle mixing with an innocent idiot girl-next-door.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was the worse written book I believe I have read in some time. I could not even finish it.<br />I will for sure not be reading any more of them. I will research them deeper before i spend<br />my hard earned money again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so fun!I like that it has 256 games!!!!! This game is so cool, awesome, and very,  very, very, very, very, very, very fun!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|when graduate I want to own my own restaurant and this game is kind of like that already and I think it is fun
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|you get a lot of help hits and can use them whenever. the thing I don't like is that there are no hints for the minigames.  I cant seem to figure them out. it is a fun game even if I have to skip the minigames.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Great seek and find game.  Works beautifully on my fire.  The touch controls are easy and accurate.  Exactly as described.  Good job dev!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|pic shop is the best app to photo shop. I get on it every day I love it its really cool
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Like half of the other one-stars on here, the volume is ridiculously low. I tried to hunt down suggestions among the comments, and the only thing I found was a suggestion that the microphone works with lower volume when the battery is reversed from what it should be. I tried reversing mine, and it turns out I had it right the first time (there is a picture on the product clearly showing which way the battery should be oriented, but I figured I'd give it a try).<br /><br />If you have any other ideas as to why it might not be picking up very well, please let me know. :(
B0068RHSCW|4.0|The house starts off as being warm, intimate, cozy. I loved the way the mother just painted whatever she wanted on her walls. She was into the feel of creating from her own heart, not from a book or any picture. The kitchen was glowing with broth on the stove. There seemed to be love with no strife between all the family, husband, wife and two daughters. They played and husband wrote, he kept a neat journal with pictures and words, phrases that rang with memory or depth, a good word is melancholy or maybe joy. The house is turned dark which is sad, it would have been so much more fun to see dreams of light keep happening, the tea party in the secret little room with the princess partygoers, pretending, using the tea sets they had, painting, fingerpainting, talking, laughing. The story was still good, yet it has the sadness and the loss. The characters are not fleshed out which is also not as satisfying. Excellent actors especially Naomi Watts. I also liked the thought of being an editor, but not of a firm, a little cluttered office with lots and lots of books and in my spare time writing a Shakespear type novel.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is the first book in the Fifty Shades trilogy by E.L. James. It wasn't anything like what I expected. Actually, I don't know what I really expected - I just knew I had to read it after hearing so many people raving about it.<br /><br />Yes, it's erotic... and it's very graphic. But it's more than that. It's a love story - even though Christian Grey doesn't think he's capable of love. It's a story about a young woman named Ana who falls for a guy who is deeply tormented and has odd desires.<br /><br />I'll admit that I was appalled at this contract that Christian wanted Ana to sign. He is such a control freak and wanted to control things about her. I'm too stubborn to let anyone tell me what I can and can't do, so I was surprised when Ana put up with some of that crap. This is the first guy that she has ever been attracted to though, and she doesn't want to lose him. I don't really want to give things away, but I will just say that Christian grew on me.<br /><br />I've read a couple other reviews that said the book was poorly written. I actually loved how it was written. It was written in a first person point-of-view from a 21 year old girl. I loved her thoughts and reactions to things - it seemed so real. I also loved the emails sent between her and Christian - these emails added some humorous elements to the story. Oh, and I loved how Ana was so awkward - it reminded me of myself.<br /><br />I had the hardest time putting this book down. When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it. The ending left me shocked and I'm dying to start the next one. People seem to either love this book or hate it. I would recommend it to any woman who loves romance and doesn't mind a lot of sex to go along with it ;)
1607885719|1.0|The plot of the Innocent borders on absurd, and it gets worse as the story progresses. I won't give it away out of respect to those who will read the book. Suffice it say that, in the end, I was left with the feeling, \\"why did I waste the time with this book.\\"  There are interesting little tales within the bigger story that keep you engrossed until the bizarre ending: the relationship between Robie (the hero assassin) with the female FBI agent, Vance; the relationship between Robie and the homeless 14-year-old, Julie; and the relationship between Robie and his boss, \\"Blue Man.\\"  But Julie is a horribly misdrawn character -- she comes across as 14-going-on-35, and it makes no sense. It is hard to assess the overall plot as you are reading the book, because it is so convoluted and you keep hoping that it will make sense in the end.  At the end of the book, obviously understanding that his plot is patently absurd, Baldacci uses his hero/assassin, Robie, to explain all of what has happened.  The explanation offered by Robie serves as a summary of the book and it confirmed for me that the plot is indeed as absurd as I suspected. Baldacci's imagination was beyond the pale in his construction of this story. Warning: in the audio edition of the book, the female reader (with her striking New York accent) is terribly distracting.  Every time that Vance (the female FBI agent from Washington, DC)speaks on the recording, you are inclined to laugh, because her accent is so out of place.  Likewise for the voice of 14-year-old Jule, who sometimes sounds like a big-mouthed hooker on the run with an assassin.  If you have nothing better to do this summer, read the book and enjoy the little tales within the bigger story; but don't look for a plausible plot.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I purchased the Prologue tan cover for my Kindle Fire and am very glad I did. Sure, it was a bit expensive but just seeing my Kindle nestled in a great looking cover like this? It really makes the difference. Not only is the device protected but it fits great AND looks great at the same time.<br /><br />Some reviewers had issues with their Kindle not fitting right or the cover not closing fully over it. I, however, have not experienced this. The Kindle Fire fits very nicely in the tabs and the cover closes right over to lay flat, no problem.<br /><br />If you think you'll be taking your unit out of the cover, then sure, I can see where that might be an issue because it \\"does\\" fit pretty snug. But isn't that the purpose? I would have opted for a different cover if I was going to take it out sometimes. Mine will never come out unless there's a reason I am not seeing, so for me, it's a great looking cover that puts everything else to shame.
0307887448|5.0|A good friend recommended this book many many times before I got around to reading it. To be honest even though he loved it, I wasn't sure I would love it as much (he kept talking about the 80's). Turns out I loved it for all different reasons. My friend was a fan because the 80's nostalgia was familiar and fun and hit home for him. For me, only some of it was familiar but it didn't matter because the book was so good, I was hooked.<br />Can I have another one please?
B004EBT7RI|1.0|This book sounded so promising.  Unfortunately it didn't live up to the promise.  Slow paced.  Badly written and repetitive.  I normally read even the worst book - can't leave a book partly read but I have moved on half way through this one.  Shame.
B0086700CM|5.0|very addicting game ..... !!!!!!! my boys play it all the time so I decided to try it and now I have a hard time putting the game down
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is great for anyone who grew up playing the NES. The references are very funny and add to the already great story. It does drag a little at the end, but over all this is an amazing movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is good for little kids but has some cool games for older kids. it is very good for all ages
B0055V6EZE|3.0|The album by Hugh Laurie containing his version of Louisiana blues is so-so at best.  As a musician, in particular a singer, his voice is wretched.  He is not that brilliant on the piano, either.<br /><br />The cast of true artists around him make him sound better, but by himself he would never have merited an album.  He's just not good enough.<br /><br />I appreciate his mucial talents, they do exist, of course.<br /><br />No, he cannot do everything, and should not bother with albums of this type.  The only possible good they would do is to advertise those who actually do the music well.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Unlike most great film this one truly gets better throughout its duration. There is never a lull in the story and in fact the film actually climaxes at the very last scene. The acting, story, direction and music in this film is perfect.  I've seen thousands of films but this is my favorite without a doubt. Whenever I need something to pick me up or give hope I simply watch this film. Every time I watch it I still feel the huge power and raw emotion this film possesses. I cannot state this any clearer. This is the greatest movie of all time.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting once u start to play its really hard to stop. so Much fun and its free too!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|I loved Kill Bill part 2, but felt the ending was just a bit anti-climatic. Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece was also didn't have a perfect ending. However, in his most recent film, Tarantino nails it.  Yes, there is lots of subtitles. I can read so that's not a concern. Yes, there is not alot of action. Funny, I didn't expect an action film from Tarantino. What you get is a masterful story with great characters(like all his films). Great acting and a two hour and thirty minute film with only a handful of scenes. All staples for a Tarantino films. The main difference is this film has an extremely satisfying conclusion. I've watched this movie about ten times and honesty can say that it gets much better after the second or third time. If you're a fan of Quentin than I can safety say that you should love it. If not get it a viewing and get involved in a very emotional, funny and great film.
1582432678|5.0|This was one of the best reads I've had this year. Totally had my attention from start to finish. The ending was shocking and unexpected.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Excellent buy, and the nly place I could find it by Christmas!  It was shipped to me just in time!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|All in all this is really a great book! I'm not much of a reader and this book really caught my attention. I will say though that it is a bit on the Ronchy side. I started to get a little tired of all the sex, but that was more in book two than in book one. Other than that, I loved the book!
0425263908|2.0|Total rip off of 50 shades of grey...but with less likeable characters.  \\"Bedroom scenes\\" pretty hot but I already knew where it was going since it is almost a total copy.
0790732203|3.0|I've always been a big fan of the 80's, which was part of the reason that I purchased this movie. The movie arrived on time which was great. Tom Cruise is a great actor. As for the lead female character, I'm surprised she's not as famous as Tom Cruise is. I'd like to see her in more movies. The plot of the movie is that a \\"responsible,\\" privileged 17-year old guy, is left alone for a weekend, and finally has some real fun. This gets out of hand when he meets Lana, a call girl. . .<br /><br />The quality of the DVD was okay, I bought it used so I didn't expect it to be perfect. However, about 40 minutes into the movie the movie started to stutter, then it stopped working all together. I then had to flip the DVD over to the other side; it worked. This malfunction was the reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4 or 5.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I really enjoyed the first half of this book and I was starting to feel why so many others reviewed this book so positively. The book description did not do it justice. I was afraid the bad boy and innocent girl characterizations were going make for a boring storyline, but it is not that simple. Both of the characters have a rich history that surprised me at times.<br /><br />The second half of the story dragged a little bit and it seemed that mistakes were made over and over again. It was a little muddy and I found myself a little bored. The other huge problem I had with this story was Travis. I really really liked him in the beginning and found myself irritated by him. He was surprisingly needy and there were a few instances when I wanted Abby to just leave him. He displayed unnecessary rage and violence, which was shockingly okay with everyone.<br /> The author even has another character mention her fear of their codependent relationship symptoms. It was hard to brush off after that, but Abby did not seem to care.<br /><br />That being said, I like other readers, I enjoyed the raw emotions displayed throughout the story. The emotions are rightfully confusing and realistic - nothing was easy. It was worth the read.
B002TXOHIW|5.0|Originally I decided to purchase the movie because I heard one of the lead character's names was Evey, my favorite name. I'm rating this purchase with 5 stars because this movie, although used was in impeccable condition, also the movie was great. This movie tells a story of a Dystopian government, and a mysterious man, known simply as \\"V,\\" who is trying to knock some sense into the citizens. He wants everyone to realize what they already know, but are too afraid to say aloud. V believes that the government should be afraid of its people, not the other way around. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes books like 1984 or the Hunger Games.
0596805527|5.0|I have about 50 or 60 computer reference books, and this is my absolute favorite.<br /><br />By far the most expansive, well-written book on JavaScript.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend trying to read this book in a linear fashion - it is much more useful as a reference for whatever you need to learn at the moment.<br /><br />The 6th edition is much more current than prior versions, and it has some great sections on HTML5 JS APIs.
B007MJSYF0|3.0|I thought it was very violent and didn't seem to make much sense.  It wasn't terrible, but I was disappointed after hearing good things about it in magazines.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it so fun nd my grandma likes it 2.  ot has 121 game kn it that u unlock how could it not b fun
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a brilliant book.  I am not even a great \\"thriller\\" fan; however, the reviews were intriguing and I gave up the cash (I am relatively cheap) and bought the book.  Boy, did I get my moneys worth (or is it money's worth?  Amy would know).  Now how did Gillian write this book where the reader did not necessarily dislike the villian?  I didn't like the villian, but I did not hate the villian...it was  strange, I just wanted to see what happened next.  How would this translate into a movie (ummmmmm).<br /><br />I read this book in less than 2 days.  Stayed up late, late (3a.m.) reading it (I have never done this before).  It is a page turner.<br /><br />This is the first book I have read by Ms. Flynn.  I want to read another one, however, I have to get some rest from this one, it is kinda like wanting to watch \\"I Love Lucy\\" before going to sleep...I need to read some tom foolery before I enter Flynnland again - but enter again - I will.  What a brilliant writer!<br />And just for the record: I thought the ending was quite good,as you will see, not the traditional tied in a  tidy little bow...I loved it.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|gets a bit repetitious.  ending is anticlimactic.  story is nutty.  hidden objects is good, has find the differences as well.  mini puzzles are good but repetitious.  got boring after a while.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was so original and refreshing. I had no clue what the story was about going in. All I knew was that it was a popular book on the \\"loan me thread\\" on Amazon. So I wanted to know what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />Although the subject matter was heavy the book never got too heavy for me. I love Lake and Will. But my favorite character was Eddie. I wish I could be as good of a friend as Eddie was to Lake. I know I'm a nosy bastard and would have been asking questions from the jump! The fact that Eddie kept her suspicions to herself was great.<br /><br />This was a great love story. The poetry was just as much a character as anything else. I can't wait to read Point of Retreat. Kiersten may be my favorite character in that book.<br /><br />Well let me stop butterflying around and get back to work :-)
B003O86FMW|3.0|Suzanne Collins could've tweaked this book differently; Katniss' state of mind is starting to get off focus, and it's hard for her to embrace what she became, what she can be capable of and to not lose track of it.<br /><br />It begins to go downhill from here.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|lovvve. this game reminds me of the old floppy version with better graphics. I love how it keeps the Oregon Trail alive.. I just wish I didn't use energy so fast.
B003R0MEZ4|1.0|Can not review an item paid for but not received also no response to email sent asking about being charged but not received!
B006G2124E|5.0|The movie tells it like it is, no holds barred. The movie was awesome and deemed to be a classic. Packs a powerful punch.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is app is really fun and additive!!! If you get this app you will love it!!! Buy this app!!! :) :) :) :) :) :)<br /><br />The cute little animal makes it even more fun!!!!<br /><br />I love this app!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was surprised that it was free judging on how cool it is, espeacially sence it's 126 games. I mean sieriosly
B005K17RU0|1.0|If you want a good weather app don't get this app get the weather channel app because this app is totally inaccurate! When I wanted a weather app to check the weather for the next day to see if it was a good day to go places, it said it would be sunny but actually it rained the whole day!!!!! So don't get this app! And definetly don't listen to the good reviews because they are trying to rip you off!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a great book, I couldnt put it down. I read all three books in about two weeks, loved the books!
B0086700CM|5.0|amazon is really improving there app store and they getting a lot of apps like apple but a lot cheaper
B004ACAELE|2.0|I checked out this audio book from my local library.  It was a bestseller and a good movie (I heard).  The story was good however the ending seemed to drag.  The reader (Vance) has an accent (British perhaps) and read the book as if it were a Shakespearean novel.  Even during action and thrill scenes, he never changed his voice.  Whether it was a murder scene or a walk in the park, he sounded the same.  It was very frustrating.  I couldn't wait to be done with the book.  Do yourself a favor and read the book or see the movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|Sometimes glichy... makes it hard to play and get far into the game but other than that it is a great game
