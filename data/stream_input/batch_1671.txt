B00519YOY8|5.0|I haven't seen this movie from end to end in a long time so revisiting it was a treat. Holds up really well, very funny and charming.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|this cd surpassed my expectations by a long shot.  i absolutely love all the music on this cd!! it is a must have if u love theory of a deadman!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|enjoyable game to pass the time. no need to spend any money as it is free and your coins replenish.
B00501LD5U|5.0|This is a great film :) it is funny and entertaining for both children and adults. I highly recommend giving this one a watch.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|This game is fun no matter who I show. I had a friend at work looking over my shoulder as a I played it and at first she was like shame you playing a little kids game. And a few levels later she was trying to take the game away from me cuz she saw how fun it was &quot;LOL&quot;. The levels are very easy at first then they start to get really challenging and makes you think for a few seconds to see what you're gunna do before you actually do it. 5 stars cuz it doesn't have any glitches, it's fun, it's challenging, and it's something that all ages can enjoy. Great Game that for $0.99 is well worth it. I bought it for $0.25 when the offer was up but I would pay the $0.99 any day. Highly recommended.
B007SAKSF2|5.0|Amazing box set, amazing sound. Waiting for something like this for forever and day. Got when first release, almost all songs by blur. \\"THE PURITAN\\" released this year and available for download and other formats. 2003's fan club single \\"COLOURS\\" are the two missing from this collection that I know of. There is a download code with the set that I haven't used yet, that may have them. Most likey there's a power super fan who can point some more. For all that it has and what I had before, this is so great. Thanks for music and the box set blur.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Exciting book.  Don‘t like reading about children being killed though.<br />I hope book two has been written.  Excellent movie also.
1567184855|5.0|If you are curious about life after leaving your physical body, this book is true and real.<br />Great information for those who are curious.
0062202081|5.0|this book was totally amazing, it was perfection, every single detail was flawless, if you havent bought it, then i suggest you do!
B0029LHX1W|4.0|I really like the character Leo Demidov, created by Tom Rob Smith, and inserted in real historical events beginning as a war hero fighting for Russia in WWII. Mr. Smith doesn't create an alternative history, he inserts a fictional character into a real Soviet history. A fantastic mystery with great pace and tons of twists.<br /><br />The following Leo Demidov books, the Secret Speech and Agent 6 by Mr. Smith are also wonderful. These are like vacation books, but better. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|wow what a deep deep movie.  its depth more than makes up for the horrible pacing.  the characters range from unlikeable to flat out idiotic which is always the hallmark of an intellectual film.  oh wait, i forgot about the redshirts.  there are a LOT of redshirts in this movie.  at one point a creature comes back to the ship and wastes a whole bunch of people and for the life of me i didnt know what any of their names were.  i asked someone who is a fan of the movie and i believe their names were \\"mercenary 1, mercenary 2, mercenary 3, and mercenary 4\\".  well at least its pretty to look at.  if you like painted turds, this movie is for you.
B008LZHA3G|1.0|boring stories.  listen once or twice, put on shelf and don't need to hear again.  at least can understand the words
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put this book down!  Had to go right into the third book of the trilogy!  Wish there was a fourth book!
B005SCSL56|5.0|I enjoyed the book and the tone of the story. A student of mine recommended the book and I completely agree. It was colorfully written.
B005LAIGWS|2.0|Stay away from purchasing this movie not like the first one. The first ghost rider was awesome in graphics and the sweet bike, in this one the rider was tight but the story line was a joke to make. They tired to hard to make more modern time and failed do not buy rent at the redbox for $1 a day.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a fabulous tool!  So interesting looking at different ideas, recipes, etc.  It's become my latest addiction!  So much more fun than facebook.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The storyline is good i love the character of CHristian Grey the book itself is poorly written but i dont mind i like the story
B007THA4FI|3.0|Interesting comparison and conflict between an ideal Britain and modern Britain as it truly is. The characters and the plot were rather depressing however. It was a solid effort but lacked the magic of Harry Potter
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great little time waster; very entertaining. Fun game for all ages. My son and I both enjoy playing Coin Dozed!
1593272782|5.0|Excellent, excellent book for my budding Lego engineer. He's 8 and beginning to explore Technics. He loves the fact that there are no words - just simple, easy-to-use instructions. I bought all 3 books and am saving the other two for Christmas. Unlike the brickmaker's own products that purport to teach building techniques, the author shows - over and over and over - the concept of gears and combining them to make vehicles that actually work. It's the repetition that's key, and the idea that once a builder gets it - he or she can move on in the book, and continue learning new configurations.  A must-have book for any builder!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I like the simple mechanics of thus game. It gives you a sense of accomplishment each level you finish. Not too hard and not too easy.
B007THA4FI|2.0|She is a master of words however her subject matter is very dreary. When did fatal flaws such as hubris or egotism disappear, to be replaced with victimization? Each character seems afflicted with any of the current societal woes such as ADHD, child abuse, drug dependency or incest, and on and on. Hardly an uplifting story.
030758836X|2.0|I plowed through the first third of this novel, then gave up. The other reviews say that it gets good somewhere after that. I will tell you everything that happens in the first 140 pages so you can start where (apparently) the good stuff begins.<br /><br />Nick and Amy live in New York. Nick writes about \\"pop culture\\" for websites. Amy writes personality quizzes for women's magazines. In 2008 they lose their jobs. They move to the small town in the Midwest where Nick grew up. Nick gets a job teaching writing at a community college and opens a bar with his sister. Amy stays home and doesn't look for a job. Amy, a native New Yorker, dislikes the small town. Elderly relatives of Nick pass away. Nick and Amy's marriage falls apart. On their fifth anniversary, Amy vanishes.<br /><br />Exciting plot, huh? Fascinating characters? Hardly. I couldn't care less where Amy has gone. I'm giving the book two stars instead of one because one of characters makes chicken-and-Fritos casserole. I looked up the recipe on the Internet and it's really good! And it's perfectly healthy: chicken, beans, onions, garlic, chili powder, Monterey Jack cheese, and I used multigrain organic corn chips instead of Fritos. Everyone at my house liked it.
0765316994|2.0|Interesting but not engaging<br /><br />Facile but not funny.<br /><br />I heard John Scalzi read an excerpt from this book, at Worldcon, before it was published.  I have read 7 previous novels by John Scalzi and I loved 6 of them and liked the 7th.  His reading at Worldcon sounded like it had potential, so frankly, I was hoping for more.  But now that I have read the novel, it seems to me, that he got off on the wrong foot starting with the 'Prologue,' which really had no good reason for existing, and then he remained entirely too cerebral and 'conscious' through the rest of the book.  Darn it.  He is known for his characters, but it turned out that his characters were mostly flat, and the most engrossing part for me was actually found in 2 of the 3 Codas added to the end of the book.  Yet even these would actually have been better done if they had been woven into the rest of the novel.<br /><br />This book is one of those 'fun' ideas that people come up with, that would have been better off left alone.  It has been done before, and done better, in both written and video form.  It is the stuff of comedians, \\"You, unnamed crewman, look behind that rock.\\"  There was some mildly entertaining existential content and a perhaps more interesting hint at an extension of the concept of the Anthropomorphic Universe, but that part wasn't really pursued.<br /><br />All in all, I felt that this book was mostly a waste of my time, and I NEVER thought I would say that about a John Scalzi book.  Now that it is over, I wish he had skipped it and gone on to its sequel.  Now THAT would probably have been an enthralling book.  I look forward to it, alas, probably in vain.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  Reading some of the other reviews, I note that some people like the 'Codas' but others don't.  Personally, I think that the first Coda of the 3 was really very poor, and totally uninteresting.  The other two were much more interesting and meaningful to me, and I do recommend them, but, as I suggested above, if the Codas are really of value, then they should have been written into the novel itself.  And if they are not of sufficient value, then they should have been left out.  It makes me wonder whether John Scalzi is just getting lazy, or if he was trying out (and failing at) some experimental technique in this book.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I'm a physician and of course bought what they taught me about how great a low fat, high complex carbohydrate diet was. (At least nobody ever recommended sugar!) I was also thin and athletic and busy and to my regret thought that fat folks were lazy or undisciplined.<br /><br />I do recall thinking, \\"Hey, we've cut the amount of fat our population is eating. Why is obesity on the rise?\\"<br /><br />Enter middle age and an expanding midsection. I tried \\"just cutting back\\" and it did not work. So I started reading about the problem.  In the doctor's lounge one day \\"Why We Get Fat\\" came up for discussion and the surgeon who had gone on a low carb diet said how well it was working for him.<br /><br />The paradigm shift is that medical science is realizing (again) that most humans are not well adapted to a high carbohydrate diet. We do better on a high FAT diet.  I know this will be a shock to most people.  Read \\"Why we get fat.\\"<br /><br />If you want more science, The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living is good, by Drs. Phinney and Volek. Science is excellent and detailed, and the book contains some valuable clues as to how to do the change better. (Lots of salt, lots of water, and it will take you a minimum of two weeks to adapt so be patient). Also good for more science is Taube's previous book, Good Calories, Bad Calories.<br /><br />This is important information, a total change, and your doctor probably has not yet heard about it.<br /><br />By the way, two weeks into it, down 6 lbs.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|this app plays well on my kindle fire. lovely graphics and pleasant music (I usually turn app music off but not with this)
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Ken Follett is always an easy read. The problem is he invariably imposes 21st Century morality and views on major characters of his stories while imposing caricatures on his support characters. His supposition that a character like Maud would have the ear of the major politicians of the time, while explanatory for the story line, is simply not credible. Only halfway through the book but I suspect historical accuracy to be modest at best and to reflect the traditional British view of the violation of Belgium by Germany as a casus belli(while planning exactly the same violation if necessary by Britain and France), as redundant.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is awesome and I am on level 10 and I will be on level 30 or higher than anyone.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book had me from the first page. So many references in this book that thrilled me, Old-school gaming, classic movies, Monty Python, Schoolhouse Rock, and so many more. It was an amazing read. So many people need to read this.<br /><br />I'm an old-school gaming collector. So this book hit me dead on. I cannot recall a book ever doing that to me. I hope ( And I really doubt it will ) that this goes into a Movie, or another book or two.<br /><br />This novel is one of my best reads ever.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love it. It is addicting. Once you get started its hard to put it down. Its a great game to wake up your brain. My goal is to try them all and go back and improve my time on them all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best because if you get borad. you can play a fifteenth miney game. that is why you should get this game.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I have not finished this book because it is a book that is easy to put down.  Not a page turner for me.  The death of a council member allows you to go inside the lives of many of the small town\\"s citizens.  I expected more from the writer that brought us Harry Potter, books that I have read many times.
B009B53LA6|5.0|Been a long time since No Doubt put out an album. This one did not disappoint! It was definitely worth the wait.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Not your run of the mill sound. Some good songs.<br />The sound of The Black Keys is a little different, not<br />the ususal pop stuff. I just like it.
B008G12ERC|5.0|First, I must say that this is my first official Muse album that I've listened to.  So this review is coming from someone who has very little history with the band, so putting that in prospective, I hope that this may be as unbiased as possible.<br /><br />I absolutely fell in love with this album!  The whole feel of it, from intricate guitar solos, dub-stepesque sounds backing up the song, using various other electronic equipment, whole orchestras and choirs...the whole musical makeup of The 2nd Law is unique and in one word:  EPIC!  I've read that The 2nd Law is very different from everything else Muse has done in the past, but that to me is a good thing.  You wouldn't want a band to keep making the same sounding music over and over again.  Being able to explore new musical realms, and experimenting are signs of a good, lasting band!  Especially if Muse is going in this direction, they have added another die-hard fan!<br /><br />1.)  Supremacy is my favorite track because it really does have a strong James Bond opening title song feel to it.  Bellamy's voice is mind blowing with how high he can hit the notes!  The guitar/bass riff is real nice too, but the orchestra is what makes the song phenomenal.<br /><br />2.)  Madness grew on me after listening to it a few times.  The m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad mad mad was annoying at first, but the song builds, the guitar solos are well thought out, and just solid classic rock sounding.  The harmonies are nice too, and reminiscent of, dare I say it, Queen at certain points.<br /><br />3.)  Panic Station sounded a bit 80s to me with the snare drum hit, and the kinda weird concept of the song.  Is Panic Station an actual place?  I don't know, I typically skip this one.<br /><br />4.)  Prelude is a beautiful \\"prelude\\" (haha) to the next track, \\"Survival\\" and it sets up the stage for how the majority of the rest of the album sounds.<br /><br />5.)  Survival should be the theme song to anyone struggling with any sort of problem or getting pumped up to win an event.  Being that this was the \\"theme song\\"(??) to the 2012 Olympics, they painted a very clear picture that they are going to win... Anyway, this is pretty close to Supremacy as far as epic-ness goes.  Great use of a choir giving it a nice \\"O Fortuna\\" feel.  The shredding guitar solos are sick, and it's another song that builds and builds.  One of my favorites from The 2nd Law.<br /><br />6.)  Follow me, yet again, starts off soft and slow then builds with great use of the dub-stepesque thing I mentioned earlier.  Great track that shows conceptual ways of using electronic equipment/sounds without sounding out-of-place or pretentious.<br /><br />7.)  Animals is a weaker track, but the guitar work can be appreciated.<br /><br />8.)  Explorers is a ballad with a nice, obvious key change towards the end, and it's a good change of pace for the album.<br /><br />9.)  Big Freeze is the most pop sounding track on The 2nd Law.  It has some nice back-up vocals/harmonies, and of course, guitar solos.<br /><br />10.)  Save Me has the best vocal harmony on the album, and picks up pace after a little while.  It's one that grows on you.<br /><br />11.)  Liquid State does not have Bellamy singing, it's another band member and it doesn't really fit within the album as a whole in my opinion.  The vibe is different, one you'll have to judge for yourself.<br /><br />12.)  The 2nd Law:  Unsustainable is the penultimate track and it's the most unique.  It has a British lady talking about \\"An Isolated System,\\" it has seemingly fictional news audio clips, and is the most experimental from Muse on The 2nd Law.<br /><br />13.)  The 2nd Law:  Isolated System contains no singing at all, and is a disappointing end to The 2nd Law because of how epic the majority of the tracks are, besides this one, however, it does not overshadow the greatness of the album.<br /><br />Overall, The 2nd Law is fantastic, and it is how I imagine the evolution of rock music going towards.I have been listening to this as I do homework for my classes in college, and it gets me through all the work I have to do.  BUY IT NOW!!!
B009AJDDQU|2.0|Was looking forward to this movie for sometime, did not get to see it this summer so I waited and waited, for its release this last week, and found I was waiting for a bomb of a move, Not up to par as the aliens movies its suppose to be! I rather have watched alien resurrection, now that was a great movie, This was not. special effects were great. but I could of wrote a better plot! even the first Alien movie was better than this it had a story. the ending was weird, and was hoping for a better flick. Sorry, but was not worth the wait or the money.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really got sucked into this book and i recommend it.  This was better than the first book.  give it a try

B00992CF6W|5.0|I played Minecraft on the pc since alpha and loved every minute of it, when I heared of the pocket eddition I knew I needed to try it. I finally got it on my kindle fire and was blown away by the epicness. Yes there is still work that needs to be done on it but so far it's so great that I make sure to take it with me on long trips and even play it around the house. I reccomend this app to anyone who likes a creative/fun game!
B004P1I016|5.0|I learned about this book through story about Bill Stewart saying that he used this book among others. This study book is really a step by step method to teach your brain syncopation. If one knows the introductory drills you only do the excercises at end of chapter. Great book. Methodical and a road map for teachers!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Read the Maze Runner from the school library and purchased The Scorch Trails as soon as I got my kindle, it's not often i find a really good book so I highly recommend first The Maze Runner then the Scorch Trails.
0345803485|3.0|50 Shades started off pretty slow. If it weren't for all the hype, I may have never made it through the first 3 chapters. All in all it was worth the read. The sex was overdone at times, making me skim over it in order to get back to what was actually happening with the characters outside of the red room!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it. Cant wait for number three.  Keeps me wanting more and more. Excellent read. I almost don't  want it to end.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Every song : great lyrics, great music, great attitude.  Hope all the young people out there give this a try.  Just  like a fine wine, Ian just keeps getting better with age.
B007THA4FI|4.0|A writer who can create compelling characters and set them in motion in a story that raises universal questions is one who deserves to be read. That's what J.K. Rowling has done in The Casual Vacancy. I can't imagine anyone who has been a teen or a parent or who lives in a community -- in other words anybody -- being put off by this book the way some of the critics were. I'm astonished that any book review editor would have accepted a submission that started with and sometimes continued on the premise that this was no Harry Potter. That's not what you would call news or insightful. What was interesting and worthy of mentioning was her ability to create similar characters in vastly dissimilar situations. Harry and friends always felt like real teens with real teen troubles and desires even if their world was unreal. These teens and adults are real in the real world. It was not a perfect book. The prose and focus bogged down occasionally but only briefly. I wish she could have published this under a pen name. It deserved an honest and unbiased reception, one it did not get. But it deserves to be read and enjoyed on its own terms.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is highly addictive and fun for the entire family a good way to test your skills and patience.  a hit
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Whenever I have probs operating a game, I will keep at it until I get at least 2 stars!  Helps pass the time, and helps to keep my mind active!
B0087HT36U|1.0|FC's on AT&amp;T Galaxy Note running 4.1.2, not good because it worked fine with ICS. Fix the FC and I'll change my review
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game is slow moving and alot cant be done without diamonds. it needs to be faster and you always have to download the next room. this makes it frustrating.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book has several turns in the plot.  One can hate some of the characters, and yet you continue to read to the end.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest! This app has some great features but it force closes EVERY time I use it. No exaggeration. And it usually take a couple tries to get the app to open. Would be 5 stars if it didn't have these issues.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I purchased this book based on her great suspenseful writing with Harry Potter.  This is nothing more than a vulgar soap opera.  I stopped reading after about 10% of the book.  Sad.  Wish it could be returned.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Really enjoyed Rowling's new book.  Unexpected ending but the book was realistic.  Only criticism is the introduction of so many characters in the beginning.  Difficult to keep everyone straight until further on in the book.
0525953728|5.0|I have read several books written by Navy SEALS about their experiences in Irag and Afghanistan, and the overall modern war on terror and they have all been extremely good books to read. The dedication, commitment and sacrifice these brave warriors put forth is unequalled. I have the deepest respect for the Navy SEALS, and all of our special forces operators as well as all of our members of all military services that have answered the call to duty to protect our freedoms. This book in particular tells the firsthand account of what men do to protect us, and bring justice to those have done, and who would do us harm. I would recommend this to anyone that would like to get a glimpse behind the scenes of what really happened, not what some bureaucrats would like to take credit for while sitting behind a desk watching a monitor so they may use it for their personal political gain. God Bless the Navy SEALS, and God Bless America!
B002YVAT72|5.0|easy to use, arrived packaged well, very easy to hook up, i really have nothing to complain about with this
0439023521|5.0|I found The Hunger Games was an excellent read. It was very well written and thoughtful despite being a novel aimed at young adults, it is written in a style and pacing accessible to you people without being dumbed down or patronizing so adults can read and enjoy this book as well. This book could have easily been silly or exploitive but was really well executed. I read it during a span of about two days and then eagerly watched the movie.  I could see the similarities too Battle Royal but there are significant differences as well between the two works so I am not sold on the hype about The Hunger Games being a rip-off of Battle Royal. The Hunger Games also continues in two sequels which I am eager to read.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this the story was good and the puzzles fun could not stop playing look toward to the next chapter
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|The title of this book may seem a misnomer since the two murders occured in Atlanta, Georgia, but not so.  The \\"Murder in Cote d'Azur\\" refers to the metaphorical death of the protagonist's sister, Elise, who took up with Gerard Dubois her nefarious lover in the south of France, became addicted to drugs under his influence, had his child and then disappeared.  In essence, her life was ruined by this man; she stoppped attending art classes  and gave up her painting.  Her sister Maggie Newberry came to Cote d'Azur not to find her sister, but to find her niece, Nicole, with the help of an Englishman, Roger Bentley, who had contacted her father.  Bentley assured her he knew the whereabouts of the child and would get her niece for her.  In the meantime, he introduced Maggie to a handsome and suave Frenchman, Laurent Dernier, with whom she fell in love.  Bentley made good his promise (for $15,000); brought the child Nicole to Maggie, and they both returned to Atlanta sans Laurent who promised to keep in touch with Maggie.<br /><br />In Atlanta, Maggie returned to her job as an advertising copywriter.  Nicole lived with Maggie's very wealthy parents, but she wasn't faring too well.  For one, she was not communicating with anyone.  One night, however, Gerard Dubois, who had come to Atlanta, contacted Maggie telling her he wanted money or he would make trouble over Nicole.  She arranged to meet and give him money the following night. When she did hand over the money, he pushed someone out of the car and drove off.  At first, Maggie thought it was a child.  But to her shock, it was her sister Elise.  She was in such a dishevelled condition, Maggie decided not to tell her parents until the weekend so that she could get her sister cleaned up and presentable.  She took her to her apartment.  The next day after she had gone clothes shopping for Elise, she came home to find her apartment empty.  She went looking outside when a neighbor told her that a woman had been killed on the next floor.  To her horror, it was her sister.<br /><br />She was determined to find her sister's killer because she felt the police were not doing enough.  And, at this time, Laurent came back into her life after not hearing from him for six months.  He moved into her apartment and they were both very much in love.  Not long after, a second murder of one of Maggie's co-workers occurred in her office.  Though always suspicious of Gerard as her sister's murderer, Maggie somehow felt her co-worker's murder might be connected to her sister's death, but she needed proof, which she finally was given.  She then knew who the murderer was.<br /><br />This book has intricate plot developments throughout that hold the reader's interest.  It is well-written, with good character development.  And it kept the reader guessing up until the end as to whodunit.\\Amazon Verified Purchase.

B0068FYZLG|5.0|The heart and soul of the characters come alive in this film.  The dance numbers and the music capture you and make you want to join in and fly with Billy.  This movie is heart-rending and all the characters tug at your heartstrings.  The very real struggles of a striking miner father who was recently widowed, and the needs and desires of a young boy are played out against the stark backdrop of Northern England.  You are transported to this place and take part in the lives of the people there.  It is a MUST SEE!!
B003O86FMW|3.0|I hate books that dont have a conclusion to their storyline in the book itself. if it wasnt for the amazing pacing of this book it would fall short heavily.
B000001EGE|5.0|Classic Elton John.  Being there when this was new hasn't changed how I feel about the music.  Some of the songs, like \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" still get to me every time I hear them.  I sing all the way through.  If you're a fan of the man and his music, but aren't familiar with his early works, this is a must-listen.  If you're not acquainted with his music and want to become so, this is a good place to begin.  If you're rebuilding your collection of his music, don't forget to add this to it.  Elton sings his beautiful ballads, and his rollicking rock-and-roll tunes co-written by long-time lyricist and friend Bernie Taupin.  They were the pair in the very beginning of his magical ride to the top of the music world, and no other lyricist does for Elton's talent what Bernie could do.  Enjoy the ride!

B006LSZECO|1.0|This was a poorly written contrived book.  The only reason I finished it was it was suggested for our book club.  The person who suggested the book hadn't read it & only chose it because it was on the best seller list which goes to prove that some people will read anything!  Gone Girl was a total waste of money!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I like all of Mitch Albom's books. They are sentimental, frequently make me cry, always make me thoughtful. I enjoyed this book. I took it on vacation and it was a fast, enjoyable read.  Was it memorable like his other books?  Not so much for me. Would I read it again? Probably not.<br /><br />If you like sort of a supernatural twist in your reading, and you like Mitch albom, give this one a try. It's not a waste of time.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I'm reading the Kindle version of this book. Superb information splendidly presented.This book is eminently readable. I've enjoyed Doris Kearns Goodwin's earlier history books and, as a former Bostonian, her book about the Boston Red Sox.
B009GEPPYC|4.0|If you're a fan of musicals and 80's rock/metal you'll likely love this. Otherwise if you're just a fan of the music from this era you'll probably still have a great time with this movie as I did. A lot of top tier actors and did a great job of capturing the time period. Recommended!
B008X8QCTO|1.0|I do not consider it an additional chapter that they want you to buy. I was playing the game,  and,  in my opinion,  not even half way,  when the request came up. I can 't continue. No way getting past that to finish what I was doing,  so IT IS NOT AN &quot;EXTRA CHAPTER &quot; they want you to pay more for. It 's a rip -off!  Can 't finish the game.
0345536886|5.0|Another great Grisham legal thriller, this one taking on the mass tort system, the corporate legal drone world, and the underdog lawyers. I had a ball reading it, and the ending is satisfying, if not happy. But a word of warning: Stay away from \\"Nasty Teeth\\"!
086571701X|5.0|I have been working on my aquaponics system for months, and this book is great refernce for those looking for more knowledge on the subject or to have a refernce guide for issues that may arise.  also gives references for other sources, wonderful book
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great game. Huge amount of content.  Really kept my interest. I was almost late for work because I didn't want to put it down. Nice art, nice mix of challenging puzzles and hidden objects. Played flawlessly on my kindle fire. I loved it!
B0087HT36U|4.0|Never played angry birds, so I can't compare, but I like the physics of this game and the cleverness required to earn gold crowns on each level. My biggest complaint is the extra second or two at the beginning of each level before you can fire. I've read this is only an issue on Android. Overall a worthwhile game, especially considering I got it as amazon's free app of the day :-)
B008D19WBQ|1.0|why Warner brother why !!!??? i was waiting for almost 4 years. for what? to get this broadcast version.????? after seeing the extended version who will go back to broadcast version?? what's your strategy man ?? people will buy this edition anyway since its in Blu-ray, and then release the extended edition by 2016 to bill them again !!!??? good luck with that.
B005H9B44A|1.0|I am a casual comic reader, not a fanatic, and not a Thor follower. I was interested in learning more, and was intrigued that K.B. took the helm as director.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, Henry the Fourth this is not. Unfortunately Thor is much closer to his bewilderingly confused stab at Frankenstein.<br /><br />Watching this movie is like sitting through a \\"story development meeting\\" ... you can almost hear the commentary of the executives: insert action sequence here ... insert emotional speech there ... another explosion here. The dialogue is formula, drab, predictable, and at times descends to groaningly stupid.<br /><br />The expected mix of wooden acting, followed by forced and fake drama, mixed together with some pretty visuals. This film is like the shiny action hero toys on the shelf at Wal-Mart. Shiny plastic outside: hollow inside.<br /><br />Thankfully the violence did not cross the line between spectacle and horror. This is a movie you can show to pre-teens, perhaps, and not feel too bad about it.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I don't think a person should have to wait for coins. It is a waste of my time and battery. Uninstalled it. :(
B006LSZECO|1.0|I get what the author was trying to do with the ending; I really do. However, there were sooo many holes in the ending and the story that I just ended up rolling my eyes. What started as a really good book ended with some really stupid and contrived crap. I wish I could get my money back because honestly with the work the first half of the novel had it should have had a better ending.
1455113549|5.0|Loved this audio book!  Somehow, I thought the book was over but during a discussion about the book with another reader, discovered that I had missed the last scene.  The truth is that, for me, I think I ended in the right place.  The true ending might not have felt as real to me and honestly, I was satisfied to end at the last meeting between father and son at the prison.  I drove past Cold Spring Park in Newton this week and had the heebie jeebies!  This mystery is well-told and fascinating.  I highly recommend it.  For parents, this book is your worst nightmare.  For those who work in the legal system, the book rings true.  Fantastic characters and a masterful pace, Defending Jacob is one of the best legal/mystery books I've ever read.  Can't wait to read more books by William Landay!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Kids loved it and it had a good cynical view of the future of humanity for the adults. I rather enjoyed it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was told this book series was THE ONE TO READ if you liked 50, but I didn't want a book to rake the place of Grey in my heart.<br /><br />Gideon is a completely different guy, and I love him too. He is dark and handsome and knows what he wants. He has a rough past that isn't revealed in this book.<br /><br />I am ready for the next book in the series to learn more about Gideon.<br /><br />This book can't be compared to the other. It's a great story very much unique
B00943SQCI|1.0|This is a horrible, horrible movie. Don't waste your money. Don't be tempted by Johnny Depp, don't be tempted by 70's music, don't be tempted by anything. i watched this all the way through in hopes that my 3.99 would be redeemed. it wasn't. rent anything else, it has to be better than this.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Sometimes at bedtime I have a hard time settling down and quieting my brain. Relax Melodies helps me relax and puts me to sleep. I usually set timer to have it stop playing in an hour but by then I'm usually fast asleep. The wind and rain sounds are my favorites.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Always interested in books by authors that are a \\"first\\" or an \\"only\\". This is indeed a first for J K Rowling (in adult fiction) and I enjoyed it enough to hope it is not the only one she writes.
B00846REIS|4.0|At first I thought I was reading 50 shades again. Predictable moments that mirrored 50 - Rich guy, girl with sassy roommate, he as a big appetite for sex. but half way through you can see the story taking on its own personality and characters developed their own voice. I wanted to see what came next and became invested in this twisted couple. I liked it, very descriptive and steamy. already half way done with the second book \\"Reflected In You\\".
B007THA4FI|1.0|This book and author did not live up to expectations.  The characters were bland and the subject uninteresting.  I forced myself to finish reading this book - hoping that I would find redeeming feature.  Sadly, I did not.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The story is rather slow in getting started.  When it finally revs up, the foul language is offensive -- something not expected from J.K. Rowling.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|What do you rate the game?I rate it 5 stars.You people mite not think the same thing but<br />that's what I rate it.Give the game 5 stars because the game Rocks.
B007T99ENE|2.0|I had a fabulous week of holiday planned, with 4 new books on the Kindle- contemporary BritLit, yah! I was SO disappointed I've lumped all four reviews together. In alphabetical order, Martin Amis \\"Lionel Asbo\\", Mark Haddon \\"The Red House\\", Ian McEwan \\"Sweet Tooth\\" and Zadie Smith \\"NW\\". All set, at one time and place or another, in England. The common theme - boring England unfolding with drab, revisionist story lines with little plot. I am SO disappointed. I finished all four, each one being a struggle in its own right. I could not recommend one of them above the other.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie and the dark knight is tied as my favorite movie of all time. I'm not afraid to say that I had a tear at the end when I watched the movie for the first time. People at my theater clapped at the end of the movie and I live in a country where people don't normally clap hands at the end of a movie.This movie has everything, suspense, action, plot twists, and etc. This movie is an example of how any movies should end a trilogy. Leaving the trilogy with a satisfying conclusion and also leaving something to continue. 10/10
B000O8OTNC|5.0|What neat and compact little sharpener. In very short order it my pocket knife and several pairs of scissors sharpened.  Its small enough to be very portable.  I like the fact that there are actually three sharpeners built into this little unit -- one for serrated edges, coarse and fine sharpening for other blades.
B00992CF6W|1.0|wtf I was playing then all the sudden a snow got turned to rainbows grass changed to gray some turned upside down furnaces with wool on them crafting tables with brick on top everything got messed up
B0098VXE50|5.0|I was enthralled with the special effects, the quality of acting.<br />Also, the psychology of narcissism was raw in the portrayal of Theron.<br />I recommend this movie on many different levels.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was amazing. It took a little time to figure out how the story was being told but once i got the hang of the narrative it took off. It took so many twists and turns and you first think one person is the \\"bad guy\\" and then it seems the other one is and it just was amazing. It was written wonderfully and the characters were developed very well. A great read!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|great book, really enjoyed the read, this is a typical Jack Reacher.and I am hanging out to read the next one
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I am a lifelong Star Trek fan and enjoyed the movie a lot. Having Leonard Nimoy in the movie was awesome. I hope the producers find a way to get William Shatner in an upcoming movie.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I have been toying with the idea of starting a pinterest account for some time now.  So when I saw the app for my kindle fire, I decided to give it a try.  Immediately upon downloading my kindle fire froze up and I literally had to give it a hard boot to get it running again.  I could not move anywhere on my kindle or do a normal shut down. Once I turned my kindle on again I immediately deleted it. Definite problem with this app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|In the crafting table there is sugar no cake. There should be buckets and boats and mine carts. But its pretty nice it at least have survival. When I got the ipod this didn't have survival.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't have Minecraft for PC but I really wanted to get it. So when pocket edition came out on kindle fire I was so happy! I do wish they would add in levers iron doors ect. and in creative mode why cant you have a lava or water bucket? Aside from those two thing this app is wonderful.
B00932A2MC|4.0|I had seen horrible reviews for this movie. It was not groundbreaking in any sense, but I found it witty at times. The special effects were cool, and it was just fun to watch with my wife and daughter. Lots of action and good for a little escape from daily reality.
B000022TSW|5.0|I first saw this movie on Showtime when I was 12 years old late @ night. I had just gotten into South park by that age, and wanted to watch the movie! I laughed my head off from beginning to end! The film is a parody of all the classic Disney musicals, and classic musicals like Oklahoma (which is parodied in the song, Uncle F'er) and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (which is parodied in \\"Kyle's mom is a *female dog*\\"). Overall, this animated musical comedy is hilarious, but keep out of reach of children. 5/5 stars! Buy this movie!
B005LAIHR2|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie from watching it previewed for what seemed like forever.  OMG, it was like watching an old, has-been lecherous dude act like a horny teenager...and not in a funny or entertaining way, either.  It was painful watching Tom stick his tongue down the mouths of every young woman in the movie.  I wanted to puke.  I wish I could give it zero stars.  Sadly, I spent my hard-earned money to see this at the theater.  Let this be a warning:  SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy yourself something fun instead of wasting it on this horror of a flick.  I only wish someone had warned me.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Please do not waste your money.  The story was not interesting enough for me to deal with all of the sex and weird crap.  I will not even bother reading the other two books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is a good game but gets hard after about 8 by 8 but it is still worth getting because it is free
B005PK553C|5.0|Love, Love, Love this show! Its scary and sexy. I watched the entire season in a few days, I can't wait for the new season to start.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|I hadn't heard any Ian Hunter music since You're Never Alone with a Schizophrenic. This album, while not hard rocking, in your face, is brilliant. I plan to go back and fill in the gap between these two albums with lots more Ian Hunter music.
B005LAIISU|5.0|Last summer, my family and I saw this movie, as we are die-hard fans of the Ice Age film franchise since the first film was released in 2002. Laughed from beginning to end. We saw it twice in the theater, we enjoyed it that much! When it came out on Blu-ray/DVD (which I got for Christmas), we enjoyed it even more!<br /><br />The plot: Sid, Manny and Diego are definitely in for the ride of their lives when they met a set of pirates, and Diego gets a girlfriend (voiced by J-Lo!).<br /><br />If you liked Pirates of the Carribean and if you love the Ice Age movies, you'll love Ice Age 4: Continental Drift!t acts as the pirate flag<br />*Drake or Aubrey Graham (Degrassi: TNG) as Ethan, Peaches' crush<br />*Keke Palmer (Nickelodeon's True Jackson, VP and Akeelah & The Bee) as Peaches, Manny & Ellie's teen daughter, who was born in the 3rd movie<br />*Nicki Minaj (future American Idol judge) and Heather Morris (Brittany from F0X-T.V.'s Glee) as Steffie and Katie, 2 of Ethan's friends.<br /><br />Scrat's antics are just as hilarious as before. If you were wondering, yes, Buck and Scratte from Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs make cameos in this sequel. Overall, an enjoyable family movie. Hope there is an Ice Age 5, we never get tired of this series and we will FOR SURE buy this entry of 1 of our favorite film franchises when it comes out on Blu-ray/DVD!!!!!!!!
0374214913|5.0|I love this book.<br /><br />Robin Sloan's writing is so vivid, I can easily picture the bookshop and all the characters while I read. This is high tech fantasy for the real world. If you like books about books, you'll love this book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am so addicted to this game! I actually had to clear off my kindle after 3 months of playing and I immediately downloaded it and started all over again! highly recommend!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I'm hooked.....not super exciting ..more strategic. I wish the games within were easier. to access but then again maybe I don't.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is an absolutely Great book! I enjoyed reading a different perspective! Have never read an adult book from a dogs view!
B007SGM084|1.0|I bought the book trilogy because it seemed to be getting so much attention.  I guess it's all about bondage sex, although I didn't get very far before I gave up.  The characters, especially Christian, are contrived and it was simply not a smooth read for me.
B007FIY3VW|5.0|This app is a life saver! I am an author who needed something to write from while on the go. I didn't want to have to spend fifteen dollars or more on quickoffice or other programs, so I found this 99 cent app and bought it on a whim. It took a little bit to get used to it, but it was totally worth it. Highly reccomend.
B000053VAF|4.0|I don't think it's a accident that most of the actors have a Roman Catholic background.  Obviously the director, cast, and writers have issues, but it's clear they are at least conversant with the subject.  Yes, the theology sucks; they don't understand what is actually taught, but you can see how they struggle with the oversimplified version of the faith that is presented at the lowest levels of a Catholic education.  (Seven years of parochial school here, and four more CCD; I understand where they're coming from.)  Given these misunderstandings, what comes out is funny as hell.  Don't take it as a theoligical treatise.  See it as a \\"reductio ad absurdum\\" of the simplified theology presented to children and laugh your head off.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Awesome game can't wait for part two, love the item search and mystery!  My kids even loved playing it. I definitely give it five stars!
0316228532|1.0|I could not force myself to finish this book.  The book starts out with a myriad of characters, but few of them are likeable or interesting enough to care about what happens to them.  The plot drones on ad infinitum with the first hundred pages flitting among the host of characters recounting where they were when another one of the unliekable characters died.  Who cares?  No me.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Unfortunately every time I run this app my kindle fire freezes up. Majorly! Like it won't even turn off to be able to reboot. Sorry, uninstalling and deleting from my cloud.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Great graphics and interesting storyline. Thoroughly enjoyed playing this game.I am looking forward to the next game installment to see what happens next.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The expectation was high and the movie delivered. Many times one can be dissapointed by the high expectation which also sometimes makes a good movie seem horrible because it did not meet or exceed what was anticipated. However, the Avengers will be in my memory as one of the great movies I have watched and for now, the best I have seen for this year.
B0099G3I96|4.0|I love Push and Shove. I think its a little bit of all of No Doubts albums all rolled into one. The only negative is, I wish more of the songs were upbeat like \\"Looking Hot\\" & \\"Settle Down.\\"
B007THA4FI|3.0|I haven't finished the book. It's taking me a while to slog through it.  Actually, I got tired of being mired in so many disreputable characters, I am taking a break from the book and reading another one before I go back to it. It's been mildly interesting, though I'm waiting for something to happen.
0545091020|5.0|Nicely recorded. Some Audio CD's have people recording them that shouldn't because they have either annoying voices or are completely monotone - BORING.<br />This one is prefect. The person recording does a great job of making you feel like you are really there.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|In the late 70s and early 80s Supertramp emerged as a huge group on the pop charts with a unique prog-rock sound that was heavy on keyboards and organ (provided by founders Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson), with jazz accompaniments on clarinet and sax (provided by John Helliwell). This concert recorded them at the top of their career touring right after the release of their album, Breakfast in America. They were known for their enormous attention to detail in the studio, and it's remarkable that they were able to exactly recreate their studio performances on stage. 5 musicians, no ProTools in those days!<br />If you have been a fan of Supertramp, chances are that you saw them possibly once in concert, so get this video. If you never saw them in concert, you still know their music from the radio play their biggest hits still receive, so get this video.
B006G3D0SO|5.0|I saw this in the theater when it originally came out, watching it again it seems to be better than I recall, and the quality of the picture and sound were awesome.
B000FBHC7S|5.0|Incredible album by an incredible band.  This is probably their best work (definitely their best known), although I would HIGHLY recommend checking out their entire catalog, with my second favorite probably being \\"Witchcult Today\\".  You should also tune into the band Sleep (PLEASE check out Sleep's \\"Holy Mountain\\", seriously).  Lastly, I would recommend anything by (the) Melvins, because they're pretty much Gods.<br /><br />Dopethrone is essentially one the droneyest, sludgyest, darkest, heaviest monster out there.  You should absolutely give it a ride.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites of all time. The blue ray does not disappoint, great purchase. I'm glad to now have it as part of my collection and watch it when ever I want. The bonus footage is fun and informative as well.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have always loved the Oregon trail games yes u lose energy and have to wait to get more but I just play another game to pass the time but this is a great game
B008X8QCTO|5.0|This game has great graphics,plenty of hints.It does take awhile to download it is a big file. Some people complained a bout the 99 cents you pay for the game and if you want to finish the game you pay another 99 cents. But I didn't mind that, I would rather pay the 99 cents first if I didn't like it I'm only out $1.00 instead of $2.00. They probably should have told people up front about the additional charge. I thought it was a very good game well worth the money
B0053O89KG|4.0|Castle has developed a winning formula over the years, and despite having a slightly darker tone overall, this season doesn't mess with the formula too much. Everyone has to get used to working with a new Chief, and we have the usual back and forth with Beckett and Castle. The cases range from the slightly absurd (a possible zombie killing) to the macabre, and as usual Beckett's mother's case pops up a couple of times.<br /><br />If you liked the first three seasons, there's nothing here to put you off. The banter is quick and witty. The characters interact well, and the cases continue to be twist filled and pretty interesting.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love this book! Couldn't put it down! Read both books in 3 days! Can't wait for the 3rd book to come out in December!!
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I've had this app on the Kindle for my grand daughter for about 2wks now, the girls LOVE It! The only problem is that now I have a 19.99 fee I need to pay for because you have to pay real money for the fake money. I think this should be made very clear not in the tiny print. Sence then I have went back and read so other apps and 9 out of 10 are the same way. Trickery is no way to try and sell your product. I've payed to extra coins and such in other apps I dont have a problem doing that, but when I've feel I've been cheated or tricked I will never use,buy or pay for anything they have. And I will make damn sure I tell everyone I know what a ripp off these people are.<br /> I do have to say the app itself is fun for the 6 and under age group so if your going to get the free app be ready to pay greatly!<br />  Tammy
B007SNFTAI|3.0|Very boring, having a hard time finishing it.The story line isnt keeping me going. I find that the first few chapters keep repeating itself.  I will keep going since i invested 17$ for it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am addicted to this game.  It is just like what you find at arcades,  fairs and kid oriented restaurants.
B00003W8NM|5.0|FIGHT CLUB review<br /><br />At first, I thought Jack was a \\"psuedo-schitzophrenic\\", wanting to escape the monotony of living a mundane, obsessive-compulsive, structured life of self-constrictive perfection, through living, vicariously, inside and through the mind of Tyler Durden, thus gaining an, adverse, connective reality.  Little did I know, Tyler and Marla Singer (Jack's sub-conscious, consciously, created girlfriend) were Devil's Advocates of choice and balance.<br />Jack and Tyler use the word, \\"clever\\" in a conversational irony, at first meeting, that is a thought provoking glimpse to the audience, which hints the nemesis in the movie's content, and the trigger of unleashing Jack's suppressed emotional entrapment.<br />This movie is a compelling array of \\"mind games\\", confusion, mischief, mayhem and twisted ironies that split seconds of comprehensive understanding, thus one moment of distraction will inhibit the viewer from gaining a full perspective.<br />Edward Norton (Jack), (who also plays one of the lead characters in \\"Primal Fear\\", along with Richard Gere, which I had to mention), gives a chilling and engaging performance as an insomniac protagonist and is also Narrator of \\"Fight Club\\", along with, actors, Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) and Helena Bonham Carter (Marla Singer), who enhance a thickening plot of  Sado-masochistic overviews of The Fight Within...<br />Dominique Alexandar
1401234542|5.0|Green Lantern Vol 1: Sinestro is an entire new direction for the Green Lantern Series. Not only has it slowed down for this particular volume, as Hal's not progressively saving the entire universe regularly in every issue as with the Blackest Night and Brightest Day story lines, but it has begun to sow the events that are going to begin major character growth. Finding out how Hal is without the Green Ring is surprising, as Hal is always portrayed as a strong headed individual with little to no cares in the world aside from his love life and even on that front he is a little dense. But moving him into a moment of great need in the real world is entertaining as are his interactions with Carol Ferris. The wrench in this particular direction is the reintroduction of Sinestro as a very reluctant Green Lantern once again. Not only has Sinestro become a green Lantern again, but his motives are being brought to the forefront as his characterization in John's eyes is effortlessly expanding. We find that Sinestro is not just a dictator, but also a man that has grown into the thoughts that he has the right idea for order in the universe. Putting him solely in charge of giving Hal a ring and having Hal at sinestro's mercy is a interesting plot point as well as a much needed team up between the two characters, as Hal and Sinestro are mortal enemies and yet somehow are forced to co exist for each others mutual benefit. As this story ins only the first volume I leave in the end craving much more especially after a glimpse into where the Green Lantern mythos are concerned. But my sole complaint is that this will be an extremely hard jumping point to get into the series for people that are brand new to the Green Lantern recent events. As a Huge fan I must suggest that you attempt to begin with Geoff John's earliest works on the Hal Jordan saga of the Green Lantern as it is one of the Few titles that have not gone into the full DC Universe reset after Flashpoint. Though I have to saythat this book is fantastic and there is no way an GL fan should think of passing it up.
159514188X|5.0|I am a fan of reading and I tend to enjoy just about everything I pick up, but some books are so great that I pick them up more than once. 13 Reasons Why is one of those books. Everyone can find something that they can relate to in this story whether it be Hannah's character, Clay's character, or the overall message. Everyone has experienced bullying in some way or has used their words carelessly to hurt someone else. That is why the story is powerful; it paints a real picture of what could happen if we are not careful about how we treat each other.<br />In the book a boy, Clay, receives a package of cassette tapes that will change his life. They are thirteen tapes addressed to different students at his school who played a role in Hanna's suicide. The only rule is that each person listens to the tapes and pass them on to whoever comes next. As a reader we get to experience the tapes through Clay's character as he wrestles with guilt and plenty of questions as he listens.<br />Readers may find themselves angry at the end of the book because Hannah's reasons may not seem like good ones. Or readers are upset that she chose to blame others and not get help herself... but we all are guilty of doing it. Regardless of your end emotions, the book is great. The story captured my heart and I think it is a book middle school and high school students should read.
B000FC21PA|5.0|I first read Siddhartha when I had just gotten out of the military and was disillusioned by the experience of war. As I started reading the book, I felt too apart from the characters since I was living in Miami, Fl in the 1960s. The the book took me in. I loved following the path he took to a more fullfilled life. Now, fifty years later, I bought the eBook and realized after re-reading it, that the story really did change my life back then. I am an avid reader but cannot remember a book that made me feel like I was in the story as much as Siddhartha. It's on my iPhone, and when anyone asks what I'm reading, I hand them the phone and let them read a couple of pages. They always say \\"What is this book?\\" or they smile and say quietly, \\"I've read this.\\" This book should be a must read for school kids.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought it was a great story that has an excellent message about war and violence that made want to keep readjng.

0415027047|5.0|Since Amazon has, as often, bundled together a dozen (or more) different editions of the same text -- in this case, Shakespeare's late Romance / Comedy, \\"The Tempest\\" -- I should make it clear that I'm reviewing the Tempest as presented in the old \\"New Arden Edition\\" (1958), edited by Frank Kermode (since replaced in the series), and in the current \\"Folger Shakespeare Library / New Folger Library Shakespeare\\" series edited by Mowat and Werstine. (Alas, other editors' names are sometimes attached to the pictures....)<br /><br />Since Amazon also bundles in Kindle editions as if they were identical to the print editions they are listed with, I will warn the reader that (so far) none of the \\"Tempest\\" editions I'm discussing are actually available in Kindle format. (This isn't an entirely new problem; a lot of Amazon's lists of \\"other formats\\" really refer to other editions of a given book.)<br /><br />The play itself is one of my favorites, and these days its resemblance to genre fantasy may make it more accessible; many readers already will have met counterparts to short-tempered old magician Prospero, his naïve daughter Miranda, and their reluctant servants, the spirit Ariel and the thoroughly material Caliban. (Not that I'm proposing a huge influence on the genre -- Shakespeare was drawing on standard motifs of folk-tales and romances, and these have persisted in various guises.) For that matter, the back-story about power politics and betrayal in (a thoroughly fictional) Renaissance Italy is of a familiar type as well.<br /><br />The Kermode \\"Tempest\\" replaced a 1902 Arden Edition, edited by Morton Luce, which had appeared in four editions, and Kermode's version is therefore sometimes known as the fifth (and, with revision, the sixth) edition. This is a documented critical text (as much as is necessary for a play with a straightforward publication history) with good interpretive notes and historical and thematic analyses. It reflects the concerns of an older generation of critics, but what it includes is no less valuable than the concerns with race, gender, and colonialism in the Vaughan and Mason New[er] Arden edition of 1999. (Interestingly, Vaughan and Mason return to Luce's focus on the pamphlet literature concerning Jamestown and the (accidental) colonization of Bermuda; but Luce was more concerned with their bibliographic problems than with implications concerning imperialism.) Kermode examines the long tradition of allegorical readings of the play, including the autobiographical, the more recent emphasis on Symbolism, and issues explicitly raised in the play, such as Nature versus Nurture. It is a solid piece of work, even if currently fashionable issues of race, colonialism, and gender are under-served.<br /><br />In my experience, the Kermode edition is accessible to some High School students, particularly with a strong personal interest in Shakespeare, and some prior acquaintance with the play, but for classroom use is really best suited to the college level. A reader already familiar with basic Shakespeare studies will probably find it enlightening.<br /><br />As is standard for Arden additions, it has a fine set of useful Appendices (six), and a sheaf of extended \\"Additional Notes,\\" including a set specifically part of the sixth edition. The running notes to the text are packed with information about vocabulary, grammar, and rhetoric, including unresolved issues which some editions quietly ignore.<br /><br />The volume appeared under several imprints, with a variety of covers in its trade paperback versions, ranging from the title on a pale background to an 18th-century illustration of the play. The last printings (I think) were by Routledge in 1987 and 1989, with, like other Arden volumes of the time, cover art by one of the Brotherhood of English Ruralists, in this case Ann Arnold. She offers a distinctly European visualization of Caliban, who is often treated by critics (with some justification in the play) as, thematically, a stand-in for Native Americans, enslaved Africans, etc.<br /><br />Starting in the early 1990s, the Mowat-Werstine series for the Folger Library replaced the old \\"Folger Library General Reader's Shakespeare,\\" edited by Louis B. Wright and Virginia A. LaMar. That was published in the 1950s and 1960s, and most familiar in their small mass-market paperback Washington Square Press editions (there were also some from a sister-imprint, Pocket Books). The \\"General Reader's\\" edition of \\"The Tempest\\" was published in 1961, and was not revised beyond changes in the cover art. As novice reader of Shakespeare, I found it, like other volumes in the series, helpful at first, then limiting.<br /><br />The \\"New Folger\\" series preserves the characteristic features of facing-page notes, and the use of illustrations from period sources in the Folger Library collections, but is completely new otherwise. The introductory material is longer, and much better; it tries to address the sort of questions students actually ask, instead of guessing at what they will find confusing; points of contact between Elizabethan poetic rhetoric and ordinary speech are (rightly) emphasized. An essay on contemporary critical issues is included for each play -- in \\"The Tempest\\" it is by one of the editors, but other volumes have contributions by a variety of scholars and critics.<br /><br />The 1994 mass-market \\"New Folger\\" edition of \\"The Tempest\\" featured a lovely cover by Kinuko Y. Craft, portraying a rather good Ariel, an imperious white-bearded Prospero, and a young-looking Miranda (she should be about fifteen, although finding someone that age who can play the part is a challenge mostly avoided). Later printings, under the \\"Folger Shakespeare Library\\" heading, have fairly non-descript covers, \\"mottled\\" or \\"marbled\\" in various colors; \\"The Tempest\\" appeared in this form in 2004.

Harry's MacGuiver-ness is stretching a little thin for my willful suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The Good<br />Nesbo drops clues so it's not like irritating Sherlock Homes junk that you never could have figured out. This story is Harry at his best. It's about his love for his \\"family,\\" his amazing detective mind, and his fight against his alcoholism. You really care about a few of the characters. Nesbo's Oslo and Harry's friends and enemies are so familiar, but you haven't seen them in a long while so it's nice to revisit them.<br /><br />I read an interview with Nesbo in which he said that a huge part of his success comes from the fact that writing crime fiction isn't looked down upon in Norway so they have a strong tradition of excellent writing in this fun genre. Enjoy!

B003K16P3M|5.0|A graceling is someone who is born with or develops eyes that are two different colors.  Being a graceling means that person will possess some extraordinary talent.  Throughout the book we are introduced into the wide array that graces can take.  But just for example, it could be swimming, mind reading, telling the weather, or fighting (or many others).<br /><br />At the start, Katsa, is on a mission to rescue a Lienid prince from the dungeons of another king.  Katsa takes out 18 guards single handedly and the rest of her crew grab the prince as they make their getaway.  Katsa runs into another  Lienid on the way out.  They race back to their own nation with their stolen prince before Katsa's king will notice she is gone and Katsa wonders if she was wrong to have let the other lienid live.<br /><br />On one hand Katsa is the strong arm of King Randa, forced to do his dirty work against people who might only disagree with him.  On the other hand, Katsa is the founder and leader of a group called The Council.  The Council works throughout all seven kingdoms to right injustices.  Katsa's grace is killing and she feels she is a monster.  We see her transformation throughout the book, but the following quote shows her thought process as she starts to rethink being under King Randa's control:<br /><br />\\"Katsa didn't think a person should thank her for not causing pain.  Causing joy was worthy of thanks, and causing pain worthy of disgust.  Causing neither was neither, it was nothing, and nothing didn't warrant thanks.\\"<br /><br />Katsa has met her match in Po, the lienid she met at the beginning.  He is graced in fighting and is the best competition that she has in fighting.  They practice together and grow to be friends.  Katsa agrees to go with Po to uncover the plot to kidnap his grandfather.  The plot is so much more dangerous than they could have imagined as Katsa's grace cannot help them.  She if forced to flee from the first adversary she can't best.<br /><br />This story was fast paced and never boring.  I liked watching the friendship grow between Katsa and Po.  It was so sad in places I almost cried.  Katsa grows so much as a person.  I absolutely loved her.  Usually the heroine will annoy me at some point, but Katsa never did.  She did make me laugh though.  I do wish she would reconsider her pledge to never marry.<br /><br />My only regret is my stupid book allowance won't let me buy the next book in the series until November (boo to husbands who thinks that food and electricity are more important than books!)<br /><br />Favorite Quote:<br /><br />Katsa practically spit back at him.  \\"Do you imagine that I need a guard to protect them from the soldiers of Monsea?\\"<br /><br />\\"No,\\" Ror snapped.  \\"I have no doubt that you are more than capable of bringing the Monsean queen and my son and the rest of my sons and a hundred Nanderan kittens through an onslaught of howling raiders if you chose.\\"is story was fast paced and never boring.

B007I1Q4W2|5.0|If you go into this expecting a terrific, blood gushing, civil war guns banging, zombie movie- you're going to be disappointed. This movie was so much deeper than that. It was a beautiful, eloquently produced piece of literature. Its one of those movies where afterwards you just sit and discuss all the things that it made you think and feel. Exit Humanity is about what makes us human. Its about the grief of losing, the hope of living. The movie was visually gorgeous with a unique attention to detail. The main point of this movie is that life will move on, albeit not without the influences of the past. Really recommend it if you are into intellectual movies, its not just a sit and watch action-horror flick.
0345803485|4.0|As a male, I purchased this book as a beginning textbook on how the female mind persieves relationships.  I was not dissapointed!  My conclusion is that a woman wants a dominant male, and one who is sure of himself and assertive.  Who is surprising, unpridictable, somewhat dangerous, and has love making skills that are above average.  The heroine in this novel, starts out as a virgin, and you share with her the emotional experience of her \\"First Time\\".  She also expresses the physical sensation of stimulation and penetration.<br /><br />Although the Author, is somewhat inaccurate in the physical endurance and length of the refractory period in the male.  It is a story!!  She has taken poetic license, and her \\"hero\\" is a little superhuman.<br /><br />Conflict occurs when there is a great difference in relationship goals.  Anastasia, while enjoying the physical aspects of sexual encounters, wants \\"more\\".  More in the way of emotional connection, and less of Christian's need to inflict pain.  She wants a more playful, give and take, and is repelled by his need to inflict punishment and pain.  The cause of the BREAKUP!  Continued in the next volume of the trigology.

The book's pages skip from page 54 - 119.  Some sections are in duplicate.  It is infuriating that the publisher (FSG) had this happen.  Of course, you never notice it until you are well into the book (page 54) which is when you are well into flight and can't return to get your money back.
B0014VQGX4|2.0|We have had a few Bruder toys.  We tried the other backhoe loader, it broke, so we got this one as it is less expensive and smaller.  The plastic components that hold the scoop to the boom snapped and broke within the first week.  The front bucket did the same thing a couple weeks later.  This left sharp edges.  Very life-like design, absolute hit with our little boy, but the parts that get played with break easily.  Probably good for the shelf as display only.  Main part of the backhoe loader is still in good shape, just not the bucket or scoop.

B0027HOBM2|4.0|Mad Men settles into its groove in season two, and it's a slow, languid movement that viewers will either savour or find to be too slowpaced. The acting and writing remain solid and the reveals about Don's past and others' problems come at a snail's pace. Although the show is set in the early 60s, the characters seems largely insulated as to what's going on around them. The death of Marilyn Monroe gets more play than crises with the Russians. It's all in the name on measured character development. If that's the type of television you find rewarding, there's nothing better.

It is super refreshing to listen to a new rap album that is genre defining like this. But don't take my word for it, listen to some of the songs and support Macklemore!<br /><br />This is the first album I've purchased since Kid Cudi's Man on the Moon II, and it is totally worth it. You won't be disappointed!

B004EPYZP8|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />RATING: 3.5 out of 5.0<br /><br />Based on the Michael Connelly novel, 'The Lincoln Lawyer' pulls you in right away with its intriguing title. Will it be about an attorney who's known for his honesty just like our legendary 16th President? Not quite. The Lincoln Lawyer is Mick Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a slick and somewhat sleazy barrister who conducts most of his business inside his aging Lincoln Continental town car. But in a sense, the parallels between Haller and 'Honest Abe' are not completely off base. Like President Lincoln, Haller has an incredible command of the law. And more importantly, he's cultivated the right connections which enables him to call in favors at crucial moments, guaranteeing his success.<br /><br />Haller is one of those characters that may be a little too cool to be believable. Nonetheless, film audiences will identify with Haller as a man who is never intimidated. Consider how he's not afraid to demand more money from his client, a member of a motorcycle gang who's now in trouble with the law. And when he meets up with the head of the gang to demand payment, he has no trouble asking for an additional $10,000. There's also humor to be found here, when Haller is granted a continuance from the Judge for his biker client, after advising the Court that he needs more time to question a new witness: a \\"Mr. Green\\" (Green of course being the additional funds owed to him by the biker gang).<br /><br />The film's neo-noir narrative, conveys a heady verisimilitude of the California criminal justice system. For example, when Haller meets with a former drug addict client who's now been re-arrested (again for drugs), he advises her that she's going to have to do some jail time (as she's already been through pre-trial rehab). When the addict agrees to give up a confederate, Haller gets her back in pre-trial rehab (an event which later figures prominently in the plot).<br /><br />We break into the second act when Haller is introduced by a bail bondsman to a new client, Louis Roulet, a young Blueblood from a rich, Beverly Hills family who turns out to be a psychopath and possible serial killer. Roulet (played menacingly well by Ryan Phillippe) has been charged with beating up a prostitute but claims he's been set up by her along with a sleazy associate. Haller soon establishes a link between a former client, Martinez, who was accused of murdering a prostitute, Donna Renteria, in the same way the current victim was assaulted (both had wounds on only one side of their face). When he visits Martinez at San Quentin and shows him a photograph of Roulet, Martinez won't even look at it, as he's bitter at Haller for not believing in his innocence at the time of trial and forcing him to accept a plea bargain which sent him up the river for at least fifteen years (I was not entirely convinced that Martinez wouldn't have entertained Haller's offer to at least listen to what he had to say, in an attempt to \\"make things right\\").<br /><br />Haller conscripts an investigator who he works with, Frank Levin (William H. Macy), a former police officer who looks like an aging hippie, to see if there's a connection between Roulet and the earlier victim. Haller is murdered after leaving a cryptic message on Haller's voice mail, indicating he was on to something. Roulet breaks into Haller's home and admits that he's guilty of murdering Renteria but invokes attorney-client privilege to keep Haller quiet.<br /><br />Roulet goes beyond the usual serial killer routine (murdering prostitutes), when he threatens to harm Haller's wife Maggie (played by an underutilized Marisa Tomei) and their daughter. While it may have been a stretch to believe that most serial killers such as Roulet would include his own attorney as one of his targets, the way in which Haller figures out how to undermine Roulet without losing the case, is quite ingenious.<br /><br />Haller calls in Favor #1 from his drugaddict client who he got into pre-trial rehab. She fills jail house snitch Corliss in on the fact that Renteria had a sexy snake tattoo on her body that only the killer would have known. The assistant DA puts Corliss on the stand, but Haller discredits him by citing a case in which Corliss's testimony resulted in an innocent man being convicted. Roulet's case is dismissed but he's detained for questioning due to Corliss's testimony about Renteria's special tattoo.<br /><br />Haller enrages Roulet by implying that he was responsible for setting up Corliss's testimony.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I have been looking forward to the release of this book for a few weeks now and I feel a bit disappointed. The story is well written with some very clever phrasing, however I enjoy reading in order to imagine an alternate world for the duration of a story, not a more bleak glimpse of other's existences. I have not yet finished the book as I am finding that I only read it in small increments. Given J.K. Rowling's talent as a writer when she set out to create a more \\"real\\" town with characters you could meet on the street, she succeeded!

0451232852|5.0|I am a huge fan of his The Pillars of the Earth series. There are now only very few writers in the world who is willing to put in so much effort in writing a historical fiction. You can see how much work has been put into producing this. I am overwhelmed by the seamless story line. The story has relived history! The only other writer that can rival Follett would be Yamasaki Toyoko from Japan though I'm not sure if her works have been translated into English.

B001KVZ6HK|1.0|I ordered and received a copy of Marvel's Avengers 4-Disc combo pack last weekend. I put the 3D disc in and there was a pulse-like hesitation throughout the entire movie. I sent it back and asked for another copy that I could actually watch. Amazon was very good and easy to work with. They sent the replacement out to me in two days and the process for return was very simple. Unfortunately, the new DVD was also defective with the same problem. I don't know if anyone else has experienced this problem, but I hope you will inform Amazon if you do. I would like very much to watch this movie in 3D, but they all may be defective.

However, although Amy is a runaway of sorts, the horrible, implausible plot devolves into an incredibly sticky, intellectually insulting mess. The ending is totally ridiculous. Not recommended.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This biography written in first person for many will be closure if you lost someone like I did in the 9/11 attacks.  Books can change your life, direct it.  Mark Owen tells us when he read a book as a child about a Navy Seal hunting Americas enemy he knew then as a child in class doing a book report that that was what he wanted to be.  So many who read this book will identify with that.  When I read Zora Neal Hurston, Teri Woods and Vickie Stringer books I knew I wanted to be a writer.  For those of you like me who want this book to get into the good part right away about the killing of Bin Laden, you get your wish.  Like a movie trailer, the book opens with a prolouge of Mark remembering being on the Black Hawk about to crash as he arrives at the place they killed Osama Bin Ladin, then you get the back story.  You are not as tempted to skip to the end when he kills Ben Ladin after that.  You will actually enjoy reading his backstory, how he grew up in Alaska hunting with his father, how he almost washed out of basic trainning; his ten year journey as a Seal before killing Osama Bin Ladin.  You still have that urge to skip to the end of the book where Ben Ladin is killed, but like I said, because of the prolouge you dont.  For me, the teaser, the prolouge at the beginning was like my Ambian, a prescriptive drug people sometimes take when they are feeling anxious and need to relax when they go on a long trip.  Make no mistake this book is a long trip, a journey.  If you lost some friends like I did in the 9/11 attacks this was closure for you.  The wars we were engaged in prior to the killing of Osama Bin Ladin was also our Ambian.  That was a long journey, trip we all had to take, before Bin Ladin is finally killed.  When I got to the end of this book I couldnt put it down.  It was like I had a front row seat, this was better than closure, this book makes you an eye witness to the execution.  I love some good ole fashion get back.  When I read how they treated the body, how they had someone lay beside it who was 6'4\\" to make sure it was Bin Ladin; when I read how they took pictures of him dead posing with him, how the CIA anlalyst who had been tracking him for five years cried, I couldnt help but cheer at the end of this book and any reader will too.  Inspite of the contraversy, we needed a book like this, America needed a book like this for what happened on 9/11.  And for that, write on, write on Mark Owen.ody, how they had someone lay beside it who was 6'4\\" to make sure it was Bin Ladin; when I read how they took pictures of him dead posing with him, how the CIA anlalyst who had been tracking him for five years cried, I couldnt help but cheer at the end of this book and any reader will too.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|In a word: **WOW!!** This is one beautiful chunk of sharpened steel. And when I say \\"sharpened\\" I mean RAZOR SHARP! This is NOT a toy, and must be handled with great care. Running one's finger down the length of the blade will also reduce one's counting ability. The full-tang blade is heavy, thick and perfectly balanced. The handle - which appears to be made of Kydex - is BOLTED on in three places, and has a lanyard hole and a protruding \\"skull crusher\\" at the pommel. The BK2 is just a pleasure to hold in your hand. The grip should fit most hands nicely, and the Kydex sheath holds it securely, even when inverted and shaken. I own knives with MSRPs of $200+, and I would put the Becker Ka-Bar BK2 up against any of them. Becker Knife and Tool has done the heretofore unbelievable with the BK2 - they have created a TOP QUALITY tactical/utility knife that also fits easily within most budgets of those who demand quality. The only location marking on the blade is \\"Olean, NY\\", so I'm going to assume the knife itself is made in the USA. There are only five stars available to rate this amazing blade, but I'd give it two more \\"just because\\".
B004QX07G4|5.0|I can't help but chuckle when I read Ellen.  This is another book of her ramblings, which often look at the mundane and ridiculous...and make the situations even more so.  I particularly enjoyed her Gambling Tips (\\"never eat almonds at a Blackjack table\\").  I guess what I truly like is her ability to not take herself seriously, to see humor in all things, and to write it down in a way that had me nodding my head and smiling.
B001LM1456|4.0|The Incredible Hulk, not to be confused with the Ang Lee Hulk movie, is in my opinion the superior of the two Hulk movies. Eric Bana is nowhere near the actor Edward Norton is and Sam Elliot is not as menacing as William Hurt is as the General pursuing Banner. The biggest advantage this movies has is the pacing for the two characters Hulk and Banner, the first version spent nearly an hour establishing the backstory before the first \\"Hulk out\\" where this one has a much better balance between the two.  The movie is not perfect and those who have no frame of reference are not led as gently into the back story as the other Marvel movies. The actress playing Betty Ross the love interest from the Ang Lee Hulk is also the superior of the two actresses over Liev Tyler in this movie. The final fight sequence is also very CGI and therefore a bit difficult to take seriously. The overall is a good movie that is a VAST improvement over the Ang Lee Hulk but still with room for improvement. This is the Hulk movie tied into the Avengers movie as well even though Mak Ruffalo replaces Edward Norton for that role.
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|Hereafter is a heartfelt journey of a movie. To begin with, I should point out the intensely solemn performance by Matt Damon... maybe not his absolute best, but a very powerful performance, nonetheless. Hereafter is about the longing of grief, the desire to grasp at some meaning in loss, to reconnect with a loved one who has died. Matt Damon plays a psychic. His ability is real, the freak consequence of a brain trauma earlier in life. He was once famous for his psychic power, but chose to get away from that because he wants a normal life. But, his brother still pushes him to use his \\"gift\\".  (All these facts are revealed as the story plays out.)<br /><br />The movie begins with a French couple.  There is a brief glimpse of them going through their day. It then follows the woman as she wanders through a street market. At this point, a sudden catastrophic tidal wave floods the area, drowning the woman... who is soon pulled out of the water and revived. In her near-death experience, she sees images of her family... blurred and distorted... much like the psychic visions seen by Damon. Then, it changes scenes to Damon's home, where his brother is urging him to give a psychic reading as a favor to a friend. Later, the story of an English pair of twin brothers comes into play. One of the twins is killed by a car hitting him. The movie switches from one story to another; the French woman, Damon's life, and the young English boy... weaving the eventual connection between them.  Damon takes a cooking class... part of trying to have a normal life. He takes an interest in a young woman he meets, but soon loses her when she insists on getting a psychic reading. (Damon reveals a bad memory for her.) Eventually, the English boy seeks Damon out and also wants a reading. Meanwhile, the French woman writes a book about her experience with the hereafter. As the separate character stories weave themselves together, Damon eventually meets the French woman and they have an instant attraction... so he finally finds his normal life.  There are facets of this movie which make it a beautiful story to bury your mind in... like Damon's keen interest in Charles Dickens, or the realism of the tidal wave catastrophe, or the passion of the young English boy and his connection to his mother - whom he is taken from by childrens services. This is a great movie... must see.

B003KGBIRU|5.0|This was a good movie. The Indian chick was hot. Wes Anderson seems to like a death in the 3rd act of late. This is a bit lazy, but still, Jason Shwartzman in a moustache. Good times.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I wanted to like this book a lot more, but the characters only became compelling toward the end.  The plot was adequately complex, but I grew frustrated with Rowling's  inability to pull everything together in a smooth, concise way.  The ending felt appropriate, though a bit frustrating.  I hope that the author will focus now on another gripping series for youth - her Harry Potter fans will probably have mixed emotions about this venture.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Too many characters, many of whom don't develop enough for me to have a sense of their identity until halfway through the book.  Writing felt a little uneven to me, in some places her descriptions and dialog are brilliant, but others felt a bit forced and over the top.<br /><br />If I had it to do over again, I am afraid I wouldn't.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I came to the book by way of an interview promotion by Ken Follett on CBS this Morning.  His claim in the interview was that he writes so that something on each page entices you to turn to the next.  So far he has been true to his word.  I didn't quite get why he made so much of a point of his choosing characters before he writes a book but now I clearly do.  My interest was to get the historical perspective of the time of the Nazis Terror.  I have a general understanding that period but not the specifics, so far the text is filling in some of the details, but the character's stories are clearly his focus.  I am about 30% into the book, and have found myself on three separate occasions waking up in the middle of the night, reaching for my Kindle to resume my journey through the story.

0316228532|3.0|I just finished The Casual Vacancy last night, after receiving it as a birthday gift. I'll admit, as a massive Potter fan, I was beyond eager to get my hands on Rowling's new work. The Casual Vacancy was good, I finished it and did not feel \\"dragged\\" to do so, but I was not left wanting more, wishing that I would have milked the brilliance and wanted to continue on with this story. Ironically, one of the biggest upsides in this book, to me, was also hand in hand with one of the biggest annoyances. This book is very much riding on observations of common human behaviors, which I thought at times to be brilliantly executed, and in the same breath, sometimes painfully cliche and stereotypical. In such a character-based story, I felt that the character layers and developments were to be crucial in telling it.<br /><br />(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)<br /><br />I think the most blatant, yet not exclusive, uses of this stereotyping came by the ways of The Weedons, and Stuart \\"Fats\\" Wall. For the Weedons, it appeared as though their story, for the most part, was \\"easy\\" and followed the stereotype of a lower-class family struggling with addictions. Their back-stories, in what I felt was an attempt to be shockingly gritty, just came off as being exactly what you expected, lacking depth or originality. Of course the house was a mess, the lawn unkempt, and rooms full of filth. Of course the mother, Terri Weedon, had a notorious distancing from her children, family, and neighbors. Of course this all stemmed from a sexually and physically abusive childhood at the hands of a tyrannous and violent father. To me, this read as being very one-dimensional, an easy, safe, and predictable way to build such a character. The same goes for the daughter, Krystal Weedon, and the younger son, Robbie Weedon, they are everything you've come to expect from such an scenario, leaving this branch of the story feeling predictable. This predictability, I felt, made me look at these characters just as charactersin a book following a tried and trusted formula of development, and it made it much more difficult for me to connect with them on a personal and caring level. In my opinion, Rowling would have benefited from venturing away from a \\"safe-zone\\", by giving these characters some traits and a back-story that the reader would not come to expect. Her excellence in originality and imagination was made more than apparent in her previous works, it is probably the single thing I most admire about this author, and I was disappointed when this aspect fell flat in The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />Stuart \\"Fats\\" Wall seemed to be another that followed a tried and trusted formula of character development, that of the rebellious, angst-ridden, middle-class teen. Coming from a loving home that he refused to accept or appreciate, learning that he was adopted, and painfully concerned with his image by his sordid attempts of not holding an \\"image\\" at all. His acting out was predictable, the ways in which he thought of and treated his parents was predictable, and his status amongst his peers was predictable as well. I also felt that his epiphany and struggle with self at the end of his story followed this same concept, and I was disappointed by how I expected it. Throughout his story, I read it as that of the cliche angsty teenage boy, somewhere hoping that we would come to learn that this wasn't angst at all, but a valid, serious, and genuine mental problem being dismissed by his family, friends, and the reader, as so. That something of an extreme nature would happen, and the reader would be surprised by his genuine indifference, and maybe even his trill, by a tragedy. Unfortunately, his story did not pan out as such, but rather his realization of his wrongs, and an attempt at moral redemption. Again, a safe way out.<br /><br />I felt as though many of the characters touched upon walking stereotypes of exactly who you'd expect them to be, but a few at least held some genuine surprises. Shirley Mollison comes to mind as a perfect example of this. A typical squeaky clean and conservative, yet petty, politician's wife. Always doting on her husband with a smile upon her face, terribly jealous of anyone else who grew close to him, with her son as her crown jewel, and her lesbian daughter the shame of the family. Her poorly masked distaste of Samantha, again I felt, was an easy piece of character, showing that, of course, no one would be good enough for her son. However, her extreme act of desperation in the name of a desired reputation, was a genuine surprise to me, not at all what I came to expect from this type of character. Her concern for what others thought of her was always apparent to the reader, however, the extremes to which she was seemingly willing to go came as a surprise to me. Although, her realization afterwards, when facing a husband who's own nature beat her to the punch, caused her to revert back into the safe-zone. I thought it would have been a perfect opportunity to surprise the reader and have her carry out her plan with the EpiPen as her husband was lying there on the floor. To show that she did have a genuine darker side, a genuine need for a desired status and a certain type of attention, rather than just a petty and over-dramatized whim brought on by the threat of social criticism.<br /><br />Also, with the exception of Andrew Price, and Suhkvinder Jawanda, I felt the vast majority of these characters hard to connect to. Perhaps it was due to their over-played and safe forms of character, but I do think that it also had to do with the strictly petty natures of their concerns. Much of the book focused on extremely superficial personal issues and traveling bits of town gossip. Things that I, personally, am not very concerned with. On the other end of the spectrum, the end in which I felt I was supposed to be feeling empathetic to likable characters, I found this very difficult. In the instances of Ruth Price or Kay Bawden, I foundmyself more annoyed than understanding. These women were in situations that they themselves had placed themselves in, but made no valid effort to change. In Ruth's case, I felt, that Rowling had a lot of room to explain this character better, to really show what made her tick, and I think that would have helped exponentially in aiding the reader to grow feelings for her. However, she didn't really do that, and I felt that Ruth's character really suffered by what was left unsaid. A similar feeling is shared for Kay Bawden. Very little explained her decision to relocate her and her daughter to Pagford, except for her yearning for Gaia to have a stable home and a good stepfather. I think it would have benefited the reader to, again, know what exactly made Kay tick. Why she felt Gavin would have been suited to fill this role, or what exactly drove her to the desperation of uprooting her's and her teenage daughter's lives. The only explanation given, really, was that of Kay's yearning for a \\"home\\" for Gaia, but I didn't understand how uprooting her from a life that her daughter was happy with, to move closer to a man her mother was casually seeing, was achieving this. A further understanding of Kay would have helped her decisions to make more sense, hence helping her connection with the reader.<br /><br />In the cases of Andrew Price and Suhkvinder Jawanda, I felt that Rowling hit a home run. Andrew Price was likable, he felt very human, and I was able to connect with him very easily. Faced with adversity, he was a strong kid, although I'm not sure he realized his own strength. I found him to be smart and sensible, yet with the believable naivete and tinge of angst of a boy his age. I enjoyed reading about his character, his thoughts and his actions, I really felt connected to him. The same went for Suhkvinder. I saw her as a girl who also didn't realize her own strength, who struggled to please and to compete with her high-achieving family. She, as well, seemed very real to me. I remembered girls like her in school, and yet, she had her own sense of individuality in story and in personality. I really enjoyed seeing her grow in to herself, her friendship with Gaia, and realizing her worth. I also liked her unpredictably bold actions growing naturally toward the end of her story, leading up to her moment of realization of her value and what she was capable of. Also, I felt her family's reactions to this being very natural as well. Her very professional parents wrapped-up in their own careers and concerns, not realizing exactly what harm their lack of comfort was doing to their daughter. Then being smacked in the face with it first hand, in a moment of surprised pride mixed with worry and concern. I felt such a genuine connection with this character, and I loved watching her push herself and succeed.<br /><br />Even with the things I was left unimpressed with while reading The Casual Vacancy, it did keep me reading, and I had fun reading it. I thought it showed potential to be much better, to be a real emotional roller-coaster for the reader, a book that would leave an impact on how you now view certain social situations, but in that regard it regretfully fell short. I found myself enjoying this book as I would enjoy surfing on TMZ or Perez Hilton. Flicking through the gossip, and soaking in the scandal. Not particularly feeling empathetic or genuine concern, but relishing in the guilty pleasure of a bit of superficial gossip about people you barely know.

This would have been so much better had they made 3 movies out of it - there is so much material not even touched in this movie it is ridiculous.<br />Not everyone in the 19th century was a Ninja/Circus acrobat, but you'd think so after watching this crud. There's so much acrobatic crap in this movie I seriously doubt Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan could pull it off. Read the book instead.
0316228532|4.0|I've read (some) of the other 600 reviews of this book, and I really can't find a whole lot to add, pro or con.  I'll leave it at this:  I liked it, found it satisfying in ways that are impossible to put into words.  Rowling's writing style here is different than it was for Potter, certainly more *grown up,* but the narrative (and those metaphors!) bring depth, and the characters are as multi-faceted as they need to be for the story.  The ending is less predictable than inevitable, which is, to me, a much better word.  It's not likely I'm going to re-read this - like I do with the Potter books - but I'm not sorry I read it once.
0316212377|5.0|I love Culture novels, and am always looking for the next one - Banks captures the spirit of things having worked out well, for a change, with humor and intrigue. I also love his clear vision of how AIs would be different to humans and inventing a large place where there is space for everyone and a very british sense of personal quirkiness. A great mix, and great fun, with both  the occasional profoundity as well as well placed profanity (the Land of WTF? :)). Banks is also a master of the BIG idea (in this case, the Beyond big) and how this relates to petty concerns of human beings, and the choice between courage in the face of overwhelming odds or narrow self-interest. Where can I get a second pair of arms?

B008B9JTLI|4.0|In \\"The Samaritan\\" Samuel L. Jackson is Foley, an ex-grifter set free after serving twenty-five years in jail. While he finds solace in living with a young, drug-addicted girl Iris (Ruth Negga), Foley is forced into a swindle by Ethan (Luke Kirby), whose dead father was once Foley's partner in crime. And Ethan seems to know some secret about Foley that even the former confidence man does not know.<br /><br />The film is best described as a film noir. Like some of the classics of the genre (\\"Night and the City,\\" for instance), the twist-filled story revolves around our anti-hero with a criminal past, who dreams of a better life with a woman he loves, and whose plans may go wrong at any time. The difference is that Foley is not very willing to take part in the scheme, as money is not exactly what he is after.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson delivers an effectively restrained performance as a tired ex-con man whose only concern is to stay out of trouble. But trouble follows him wherever he goes. He is a sort of a person who, while running away from one predicament, runs into another bigger and nastier one, and Samuel L. Jackson as that person is convincing. The interesting cast includes Gil Bellows, Deborah Kara Unger and Tom Wilkinson.<br /><br />\\"The Samaritan\\" is flawed, however, and flawed in more than one way. For those who have seen a certain Asian thriller (which should remain unnamed here), the idea upon which the plot of \\"The Samaritan\\" rests may appear a familiar one. That itself didn't bother me as writers David Weaver (who also directs) and Elan Mastai have developed it in a totally different way, but the ending is disappointment because the dilemma and complexity Jackson's character faces are sorted out in a too neat fashion.<br /><br />\\"The Samaritan\\" is a crime thriller that requires a pretty big suspension of disbelief at some scenes (and I am not just talking about the genre conventions). Once you get past that part, you will find the film a thrilling ride with Samuel L. Jackson's strong performance.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just ordered this app about 3 hours ago and have yet to put it down.  The sounds and graphics are just like being in front of the actual machine.  Truly awesome!
1934030597|4.0|I got this book so my husband could fix things on our bikes. Its a great easy read and has lots of information.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I chose to give it a 3 star rating cause it was more predictable than the last book ....still a very good book and great soft porn
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love movies, and when the avengers came out on blu ray I had to have it. Also digital copy is important to me. This option was only available in the 4 disk set which was selling for upwards of 40 dollars. Amazon offers it for the same price as the standard DVD sells for at Walmart. This is a deal you can't pass up, giving me all I wanted an more.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|The product arrived fast. The price was excellent. It came just in time for my husband's birthday.<br />We don't have Starz, so we hadn't seen this season yet. But if you loved the first season, you must have this blu ray. It's beautiful. The colors, the clarity, the action scenes--spectacular. I would actually recommend investing in a four disk blu-ray set when the final season is released.<br />As for the actual contents of this season, it's epic and poetic, but nothing compares to Andy Whitfield's performance in season 1. I believe the writers anticipated this, because this third season isn't entirely focused on Spartacus. You'll still LOVE it though, so do buy, or wait for the 4 pack.
B0086700CM|5.0|i like the game but gets boring after a while but my baby cousin loves it so i keep  it on my iphone so i guess i will say it is fun
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|As a vampire lover (WAYYYYY before I ever picked up Twilight), this book combines the best of all of my fantasy worlds.  Vampires, witches, ghouls, daemons and to top it all off, a smart, beautiful clueless girl who holds the power of the world at her fingertips.  Some of my favorite parts of the book were how in depth the author went to describe areas and food.  I could almost taste the wines...I could literally vision myself at Oxford.  This is a fab book with a great plot.  I would say that anyone who likes the fantasy world of mystical beings living with us needs to read this book.  BTW...the sequel is pretty darn tootin' good too!
B007THA4FI|1.0|this book was a total bore . I wish I were Harry Potter so I could get back the time I wasted on this book
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Much better than stock meter,  lots of information to monitor power usage. Highly recommended and worth getting. One more word
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What can you say about Downton Abbey season 2? Well if you like the first season then you will LOVE the second one! There are a lot of things happening in this season and this DVD set comes with Lots of bonus features and the special Christmas episode that fans will just die over, mainly cause of the ending. (It's AWESOME!!) As for my rating of this well i gave it five stars not just cause it's a great show and i love it, but because it got her five days before Amazon said it would! Best Anniversary gift ever!!!!
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|This game was fun and entertaining good graffics. Easy to understand and use. Would to recommend anyone of any age and ablity.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's alright, can be a aa a a little slow at ti. Rs but still fun. I give it a shot or something.
B0001I561Y|5.0|A few years ago I had bought a Fullmetal Alchemist product, [[ASIN:B000FS2VWM The Conqueror of Shamballa (Limited Edition)]] (which I actually bought twice, for a total of about $50, because I lost the first, and thought all the extras were great). I mention that because the [[ASIN:B0001I561Y Aladdin gift set]] is similar - it includes a book, illustrations, and extras on the DVD's.<br /><br />However, Aladdin's book has over twice the pages (though, the words are much larger, and most of the book is illustrations. The FMA book lists a bit about history and the world of the movie, which the Aladdin book doesn't, but the Aladdin book does talk about making the movie and the people involved)<br /><br />Aladdin's gift set includes seven prints - signed sketches, and there's a lot of finished images in the book (the FMA product has ten fully colored prints and the book includes several pages of sketches). What makes Aladdin's prints more interesting, is that each one comes in a neat little paper frame, making them look so much more important. The sketches also seem special because the artists were asked to draw their character and in the medium of their choice, so if you know what to look for, you can see something about the artists' and characters' personalities. There's also Aladdin's \\"Senitype\\", a reproduced frame of the movie (which is quite cool).<br /><br />There's a lot of extras on Aladdin's DVD's. FMA's and Aladdin's discs both have several commentaries, both have a 'the making of' video that shows quite a bit of stuff, and an image gallery (there's probably more to these in Aladdin's extras). Aladdin also has some deleted scenes and songs. I think the Aladdin gift set and the [[ASIN:B0001I561E Two-Disc Platinum Edition]] both have the same DVD extras, so between the two products, what I've mentioned earlier is probably more important.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, when directly comparing it to the two sequels ([[ASIN:B0007NY3AI The Return of Jafar]] & [[ASIN:B0007NY3A8 Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]) and the TV series, the first movie looks different. The movie definitely uses colored lineart with some different line weights, while the lineart for the other movies seems to have the same line width and is probably black (though hard to tell for sure). I think the first movie is also the only one to have Carpet with this design, which is later simplified for the other movies and the series (it's mentioned in the extras that they used the computer to print Carpet's design because they couldn't draw that many details). Genie also has a glow to him that isn't in the other movies or the series. Instead of just being blue, he seems almost non-physical, like the puff of smoke he was designed to resemble. There's quite a few special effects in the movie (I usually prefer more traditional 2D stuff, but some of them work pretty well). I think this movie also paid a lot more attention to mood and emotion than the other movies and the series. It's mentioned that good guys wear blue, bad guys wear red (the theory of colors is based on some type of art, mentioned on the DVD), and the color scheme of a scene is based on the characters' feelings. A bit off topic, but something that has me slightly puzzled, Aladdin's personality changes after the first movie. He's much more clever in this movie than in the TV series.<br /><br />The plot and enjoyability of the movie, I suppose depends on the person. I didn't really pay much attention to the movies when they came out, and though I watched some episodes of the series on TV, didn't think all that much about it until this year. But, there's something to be said when people's ideas of a genie are based on this movie, and when everyone knows the name Aladdin (though the movie isn't original, the things it's based on aren't that well known).
B0026IUXME|5.0|Adrian Brody has shown his  dynamic range in acting. Playing anything possible. Its a great movie. Nothing but amazing. Great deal for it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is simple and fun. More addicting than you would think. The ads are not too bad. Easy at first but gets very challenging and makes you think.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fantastic game that is truly addicting. Once you start playing you have a hard time putting an end to your playtime.  Love it!!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I just love this game its challenging and fun. It also has so many levels. Its just amazing. I didn't think it was going to be as fun as it is.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is by far one of my favorite apps! pinning away finding craft projects for the holidays! highly recommend this for everyone! !!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Liked that the game lasted for quite some time so to be worth its price, which was minimal. Enjoyed this so much I have decided to purchase its sequel.
B0087HT36U|5.0|So I have to write 20 words to explain how great this game is and how challenging it is.... Well there you go I love this game and would Def barely recommend it to anyone
B007TNS6JI|3.0|it is a good game if  they would fix the bugs, game crashes  you loose all your money and upgrades. I'm starting over my forth time.
B008ALA6DW|3.0|This adapter is not cheap at all, and I was disappointed when I found out that it doesn't even come with a plastic cap to protect the thunderbolt connector.<br />The other 2 adapters I got (VGA and HDMI) both came with a cap, and one of those wasn't even an original Apple product!<br />The adapter works well, as you would expect from a $30 piece of plastic.
B005XN3150|5.0|I recently bought once upon a time season 1 for my kindle and I couldn't put it down! I watched the first season in 3 days! They my boyfriend starting watching it and couldn't stop either. I like this show a lot! I think it's neat how they incorporate all the characters together!! Would recommend this show to kids, families, or anyone who likes Disney/fairytales! Season 2 is starting off to be really good as well!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This a a great series.I started watching it a couple of months ago netflix then I needed more so I purchased the following season on Amazon. I thought at first it would be something just the Brits would watch but it's very entertaining.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME I GOT IT FOR FREE AND I LOVE ALL 4 OF THE ICE AGE MOVIES. ITS AWESOME BUYING THE ANIMALS HOMES. EVERYTHING YOU SEE IN THE MOVIE IS ON THIS GAME.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I pre-ordered this book in anticipation of another amazing, well crafted story from the Queen Authoress herself.  The intro was okay but dull; however, I was quite certain J.K would weave her writing magic in a splendid fashion as the story progressed.  Each character she presented was despicable and JK's \\"adult\\" descriptions of them were foul, pornographic, sadistic and disturbingly dark.  The F-bomb was used so many times, I wondered if this was the first time she allowed herself to cuss because it was like she just couldn't get over herself about using excessively, ugly language.  I only read 17% of the book (on my kindle) and then quit reading it altogether because I couldn't stand another deplorable word.  I concur with those who said they wouldn't even put the book into the GoodWill or other thrift store bins.  Wouldn't want it to get circulated into the hands of another unsuspecting reader.  I am hoping inspiration returns to this very gifted writer but I won't pre-order her next book.  I will wait patiently to read the reviews first before I part with my money.

B0099G7KDQ|5.0|If you already like Mumford & Sons, then this album is sure to get you excited. Mumford does not disappoint. The music is similar to previous work, but still great to listen to. The lyrics on this album are fantastic. I would highly recommend this album to anyone and everyone.
1401324649|5.0|A very entertaining and well-written feel-good book. To my regret the author still hasn't had the courage to publish a second one. I read it in Swedish and liked it so much that I gave several copies to Norwegian friends. As soon as the book was published in English, I ordered it from Amazon.<br /><br />THAT was an exhausting and expensive ordeal. Ordering the same book to two different people in the US, I spent hours on the internet, ending up getting four copies without knowing. I refuse to spend more frustrating time trying to get my money back. It is better that my friend who received three copies passes two books on.
0439023513|2.0|Short of maybe two sections of the book that really drew me in, I had a hard time completing this final book of The Hunger Games series. The premise is still great, but I feel like the author was maybe rushed to write both this and Catching Fire. The plot meandered and didn't quite make sense (everyone really things it's okay for Katness to keep going into these dangerous situations, and then she's constantly in distress?), and characters didn't feel as fleshed-out as they did in the first two books, including Katniss.<br /><br />The love triangle didn't bother me in book 1, didn't bother me too much in book 2, and finally managed to bother me in book 3. Until near the very end, I really didn't care who Katniss ended up with and came very close to skimming sections devoted entirely to the Peeta/Gale conflict. And then... the explanation for whom she chooses (or rather why she didn't choose the other) was forced and really made no sense. Did Collins really have no plan whatsoever for how this would turn out? And if not, why did she spend so much time on it?<br /><br />Also, the violence. Man, the violence. I obviously expect a war to be violent but the tone of the writing in this book (and the previous two) did not prepare me for the level of violence I ended up reading. It started to remind me of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children in that way, which wasn't good.<br /><br />The world is still very interesting, and Collins' writing style is enjoyable. I just wish she'd had more time to really plan out the plot and to edit. It could've been so much better.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator app. It's easy to read, easy to work, comes in handy when out shopping, can go wrong with this one. thank you
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book. Hooked me right off the bat. I hope somebody makes a movie out of it. Buy it and go read it now.
B0050SRZOQ|4.0|The finale was a two-parter, and On Demand only offered the first part.  I got impatient and watched it here for a very small fee.  It is a fairly fitting ending to the long story of the series, and an interesting take on the journey of young Clark to the moment he became Superman in all respects.  If you haven't seen the ending, watch it.
B009B51K9U|3.0|For those who are under 30 Green Day must seem like a great band.  Those of us who are older recognize the bands that Green day listened to in their music.  Uno has some catchy songs and for the price is a pretty decent record.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Downloaded for my 7 yr old nephew who loves angry birds...He was not disappointed. A little addicting also, got me interested.  thank you
B005IQZB14|3.0|The book is ok, but not the best in my opinon....it moves slowly and the author starts out whiny.....I am halfway through it and have a difficult time picking it up to read....the other reviews were good, and it started out good....so I ordered for it my Kindle.
B009OYTIXS|4.0|The pilot shows Arrow has promise. I thought it was well acted and the dialogue/writing was very tight. We'll see if it can build on this good start. I'm hopeful CW has a hit.
B008XG1X18|5.0|so much more convinient than the website! easy to scroll through pins and look at friends boards. categories are nicely displayed.
B00846REIS|4.0|Bared to you is a good read. The connection between Eva and Gideon is raw. They seem to only interact well while having sex. Eva‘s jealously gets the best of her while Gideon is overly controlling.
159514188X|5.0|This book will forever change the way I look and act towards people. It's sad but im glad I read it, ill recommend this book to everyone. If people read this book maybe the world wouldn't be such a harsh place.
B007THA4FI|4.0|If it didn't have JK Rowlings on the front cover, I think I would have been blown away. Unfortunately, my expectations were that I was reading the author of Harry Potter, and it turned out to be surprisingly Ibsenesq. Not a bad thing, just unexpected. The story was exceptionally executed, and overall a good read. I will likely pre-order her next one too.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|A great combination of fun, and passive learning.<br />Amazing to share with.<br />Have watched seniors to toddlers approach the tasks<br />and walk away self satisfied when a task is performed.<br />Then needing to play again.<br />Solid game application.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an excellent book!  It is very well written and kept me guessing all the way through.  I could not put it down, even at the end.  I kept turning the page after it was over looking for more.  Was that really the ending?  Did he just give in?  She won? Or did she?  She made her bed and now she has to lie in it!  Maybe that was a good ending?
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|you will be sucked in...easy instructions. great physics.  plus now you don't have to go to an arcade to play a coin dozer.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series of books begins with \\"Bared to You\\" and continues with this second book.  Fast paced and easy to read.  The characters interactions and story lines are captivating and keep the reader wanted to turn the page to earn more about them.  Highly recommend!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Initially played on the IOS on the insistence of a self diagnosed Fruit Ninja Addict.<br />The play on the Kindle Fire 1 is quite smooth and relaxing.<br />A great game and for some addicting.
0525952616|5.0|Great story and vivid depiction of the possibilities of technology gone wrong. I loved all the black ops material. Many times I found myself rushing home to read more.
B009AJD5E0|3.0|It was a bit of a let down.  The first part of the movie was pretty good, but there were somethings that seemed, at least for me, to require more explanation.  Toward the end it was disappointing, and the very end was really a let down fo rme.  I expected something new and exciting, and it really wasn't, at least not for me.  It was worth watching.  I'm not sorry to have paid 3.99 to see it.  I love science fiction.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I find the cast of characters a bit confusing. There is not enough background on each to easily delineate them from each other. The conflict over the newly empty Council seat does bring out the underlying conflicts and mean spirited relationships that often exist in very small towns.I do find her use of the children's lives as almost separate from the parents but who are controlled almost unmercifully by these parents.<br />This is such a different J.K. Rowling that I am having a hard time getting accustomed to her. I do find the overuse of offensive language unnecessary.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love this game!!! I got Quell reflect first, and after conquering that game,of course I had to get this one too....almost done with all levels,  So looking forward to what Quell game they will come out with next. This game is a steal for 99&cent;&hellip;..Get it, you will not regret it(o:
0439023521|5.0|When I began the book I was a little weary of what I was getting into. I knew that many middle school aged children had been reading it and my first thought was that it was going to be a book aimed toward a younger group. Alas I was wrong and very happy I was.<br /><br />Suzanne Collin's Hunger Gamers is a spectacular read. Each chapter leaves you hanging on the edge, not a dull moment to be had. Like any great book, when you think you know what is going to happen the author throws you a curve ball. The Hunger Games, in my opinion, is in the same league as the Harry Potter series. This book sets the tone for a great trilogy.<br /><br />The book is such an easy read, the style it is written in takes a few chapters to get adjusted to. There is no age limitation for this book; middle schoolers, high schoolers, and adults will found this book a fun, interesting, and capturing read. I wasn't able to put the book down and I sure that those who have and will read it will have the same outcome.<br /><br />I suggest this book to any reader, even to those who are not active readers, this book is worth the short amount of time you'll spend on it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the website, the app works great on my kindle fire, now I'm able to pin any time I can.
B000W03RHQ|3.0|When I got the CD the case came cracked , It didn't really bother me because for all I know it could have been the delivery guy no the senders . I quickly put the CD in my stereo to listen to the amazing thing that is Nightwish . The first CD worked fine , but when I put the second CD in it starting skipping at \\"Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\\" and just didn't work at all after that. I can understand how a case can crack by a delivery accident but how can the CD get ruined so  much that it won't even work?
B008OOYALE|3.0|good game but The gold prices are OUTRAGEOUS.  ITS NOT FAIR THAT WE CANT HAVE any good ones without over 200 gold!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well written, hope it leads to more. A few plot holes, but All in All some of the best i have read this year
B0087HT36U|3.0|This game is great fun and I didn't need very many extra bombs I purchase. They were worth it to pass those few levels I could not master on my own.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Well, in my eyes anyway<br />I liked the way the story unfolded, it  was a good Reacher read<br />Kept my interest until the end, a satisfying story<br />I think my biggest problem will be with having a picture of Tom C in my mind when I read Reacher books<br />Maybe Lee can introduce a back problem for Jack in future stories<br />Its a bit like using the Expendables as the Seven Dwarfs<br />Nice read though<br /><br />yochemin
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Seen him on TV one night and loved his music and style. I could watch this one over and over. Great music! Plays spectacular guitar and sings great. I would recommend this one to all!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Walking Dead is one of my very favorite shows on TV. I watched every one of the episodes on TV and then again on my IPAD just recently so I will be refreshed when the new season starts this Sunday!!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Alien universe that Ridley Scott created for us 30 years ago.  Since then, sequels have come (thank god no remakes).  Prometheus came along promising not to be a direct prequel, but in the same universe.  Although I consider it a prequel, I still said whatever and just enjoyed the movie for what it was.<br /><br />All of the references and similarities between this and the first two Alien movies are amazing.  Any scifi fanboy will be happy with what Scott did for that.  However, it lays out something I didn't expect and that's a pure scifi movie.  You won't find a high amount of CGI or super high amounts of action...what we get here is story, setting, atmosphere and a treat.<br /><br />Could it have been better?  Sure, but what couldn't?  One thing is for sure, Ridley Scott made sure to leave it open for another sequel which could definitely lead up to the first Alien movie.  I can't wait!
B00846REIS|5.0|Much better than 50 shades. I loved 50 but it felt like the author had 10 favorite words and used them over and over again. In this book the author had a wide vocabulary and it was just well put together. I've cried. Laughed. And connected with this book in so many ways and it was fabulous! On to the second! :)
B002NXOQF2|5.0|A beautiful adventure could not put it down!! there were so many awesome plot twists and dangers befalling the rabbits that i had to keep reading to make sure they would be ok. The author personifies the characters so perfectly its hard not to fall in love with this book!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This books is so unbelievable. It was so amazingly well written and ALL of the characters stole a piece of my heart.I have never cried so much from a book,but it was so worth it.I felt like I was part of Lake and Will's love,sorrow,heart wrenching pain,as well as their joy.I was sobbing one minute and snorting with laughter then next.Slammed is such a soulful read.sigh ..
B006LSZECO|3.0|loved the book.  hated the ending.  im glad i got it from the library.  it did keep me guessing and for that i loved it.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Honest and unafraid to look @ herself. This is a memoir and folks who do not agree w/her actions need to realize that we all do things others and ourselves would later agree w/as distasteful but this is reality. Bravo to her for her bravery. Entertaining and thought provoking.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app on my kindle on a daily basis and absolutely love it. Don't be fooled by imitation apps...this is the real deal!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I got the album in preparation for going to Springsteen's September 2012 concert in Washington, DC, as part of his 2012 Wrecking Ball Tour. The concert featured most of the Wrecking Ball album songs and, at 62, the Boss is still the Boss. Before a packed house in the 45,000-seat Washington Nationals baseball stadium, he performed non-stop for close to four hours with the crowd-pleasing vigor of a 20-year-old.<br />\\"Wrecking Ball\\" is classic Springsteen -- poignant, moving, biting lyrics telling the story of the millions in our nation who work hard all their lives and never get much of a break. If you sympathize with his views, you'll love the album. If you're among the privileged rich, you probably won't.
B00846REIS|5.0|This series is much better than tge 50 Shades series. The characters are more complex, there's a better story line, and I even got frustrated with the characters. I couldn't put it down
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great game for when you have to wait a few minutes for a place to open or to meet someone
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I use this app daily and really like the ability to use different versions of The Bible and the audio versions help with the correct way to pronounce some of the words.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|It's rather personal whether you give this three, four , or five stars. I agree with most of the other reviews.  I settled on four stars. Van is the greatest ! I like the use of horns, the acoustic bass, and hearing Van on the sax in always a treat. I hope he makes another 35 albums. Well... it could  happen.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book is amazing in using time to describe the preciousness of life. I definitely recommend this book for people to read.
0321811984|4.0|I relly enjoyed reading this book, there is a lot of useful information! If you want to improve your visual communication skills, read this book!
0738212415|5.0|I NEVER write reviews, but I have to do so for this book!  I'm a senior who has never drawn at all.  If you think your drawings look like they were made by a six year old, like I did, this  book is the place for you to start!  I've bought several beginner books and they sometimes start out with help for beginners, but by page ten they are far too complex for me. In this book, Mark Kistler actually demonstrates texture, shading, perspective, and other fundamentals of drawing. If you think you can't draw, get this book. You will be amazed at how much you will be able to learn!  I'm still no artist, but now I'm enjoying learning and I can see real improvement!  Thank you, Mark Kstler, for really meeting the needs of beginning artists!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun game, definitely worth the price! Challenging but not too difficult where you're stuck on a puzzle for too long.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Growing up this was one of my favorite Disney movies.  In fact, there was a time that I watched it every day for two weeks straight.  Drove my parents crazy but I was happy.  I just liked how Mulan was empowered, and not as flighty as the other Disney women.<br /><br />Mulan is the only child of her mother and father, and as a girl, it is up to her to make a good match and marry well to bring her family honor.  The problem is, Mulan just isn't cut out for that type of life.  She isn't graceful enough and just has more spirit than a proper girl should.  So after failing at the Matchmaker's, she decides to further deviate from the appropriate path when she steals her father's armor and army conscription and rushes away into the night to take his place.  But pretending to be a boy will be a lot harder than she thinks, and even worse, training is not progressing well and the Huns are in China.<br /><br />Mulan is a strong female character.  Which is great when you consider that a lot of the Disney girls aren't that strong and are only holding out for their prince's approval.  So well done on this one Disney.  Even her love interest, Shang, doesn't know she's a girl, so there isn't that usual mix of romance that is found within these  movies.  Although Shang is a pretty neat guy himself, and seems dedicated to the work he is doing.  Her friends are pretty goofy and provide comic relief.  But then again Mushu does too in his dragon guardian role.  And all of the voice actors were spot on in this movie, I thought the voices fit well to the characters.<br /><br />This movie is very colorful and I like that; I especially love the part with the Chinese paper dragon as I thought it was pretty and authentic.  It was standard animation, and honestly, with all the Pixar and CGI stuff Disney does now, I had begun to miss the plain cartoon feel of the older movies.  They just seem like classic Disney.  Picking the story of Mulan to use, was as I said before,  a brilliant stroke by Disney to get a strong character out there.  It was a neat story and watching Mulan grow during it was fun too.  I can say that as an adult the story felt a little rushed, but not nearly so much as some of the other Disney movies.<br /><br />The music was fantastic in this movie.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is another one of my favorite Disney movies.  Of course most of the Disney movies from the early nineties timeframe are some of my favorites.  I much prefer them over the Pixar creations we get now (although some of those are good as well).  There's just something about that classic animation.<br /><br />Belle is a bit of a strange girl in her town.  For one, she likes to read.  For another, she's not completely enamored with Gaston, the local huntsmen who's prowess at hunting is only small compared to his overinflated ego.  But Belle is happy with her father, the inventor.  In fact, when her father gets lost on the way to a fair and ends up the prisoner of a beast in an enchanted castle, Belle loves him so much she offers herself in exchange.  She despises the beast at first, but then grows to know his true character as she stays at the castle.<br /><br />The voice actors for this movie were very good.  Belle is young sounding but adventurous, the Beast is somewhat scary and can be smoother and all the servants have their own sound as well.  Which, when you think about it, is actually quite clever considering they were household items and shouldn't have had an appropriate \\"sound\\" to their voice at all.  So that was kind of neat how they brought out the character in regular items through the use of voice.  Even Gaston had that arrogant way about him.  I will say that I wish Belle was a bit stronger of a character.  Sure she stands up to people, but all her dreams of escaping from the area are kind of thrown away when she agrees to become a prisoner at the castle.  I guess I wanted to see her get out in the world.<br /><br />The plot is a classic one though and Disney did a good job of recreating it through this movie.  The addition of the enchanted castle was a nice touch with all of the different servants doing their job as best they could.  The animation is standard, but I like that about the Disney films.  They didn't need anything fancy to tell a good story.  Although the animation involving the chandelier in the ballroom was exceptionally done, and is one of my favorite parts of the movie.  Pretty impressive for the early nineties.<br /><br />Like most Disney movies, the music in this one was exceptional.  \\"Tale as Old as Time\\" and a good deal of the other songs are ones that stay with you.  You just can't forget the lyrics to them.  And like most Disney movies, you of course can't help but sing along.  I have some mixed feelings about the first song \\"Belle\\", at times I liked it because it told a story, and at other times I found it just odd.  And then there's the \\"Be Our Guest\\" which is just a great number because of the amount of life and fun that's put into the song.<br /><br />A lovely movie that's great for the whole family.  It takes a classic tale and makes it relatable to a large group of people, of all ages.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012ell a good story.

B006YXTRHY|1.0|I really liked the first three Twilight movies.  That's why this one was such a disappointment.  It's incredibly boring.  Nothing happens except a wedding, a honeymoon that took forever, talking wolves (cringe!) and a little confrontation at the end.  This shouldn't have been a movie, but cut down into a few scenes and part of a bigger movie with more going on.  Really disappointed I bought the DVD.  Wait until it is bargain priced or buy it used, or just rent it and save your money, if you really want to see it to get the whole story.  Not much \\"story\\" to get here except a few things, though...
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|This is mostly uptempo's but it is the ballads Breaking Your Own Heart and Standing In Front of You that are two of the standouts on the album. Breaking Your Own Heart is one of the best ballads Kelly has ever done. For the uptempo's the highlights would be Alone, I Forgive You, What Doesn't Kill You, and Let Me Down. Einstein is my least favorite song. It does a good job combining potential pop hits along with good music. Similar to Breakaway in this way. If you're a fan of Kelly or a fan of pop music, I highly recommend this album.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book is a masterpiece. She has to be one of the best writers of our time. For any adults that felt she was only capable of writing children stories, you are terribly wrong.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|After watching the TV show, it was very easy to visualize the characters in the book. It made for a very easy, quick and entertaining read.
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|This movie does about as well as it could in fitting a big novel into a 2 hour movie.  There are certain obvious flaws in the film.  Gary Cooper is horribly cast as Howard Roark.  His acting is stiff and he is much too old to portray the idealistic, brilliant young Howard Roark.  The characters are 2-dimensional archetypes rather than actual people.  The Rand books tend to be more popular among the young.  Once you grow up and live in the real world you realize that much of her vision was fantasyland.  She saw the world as black and white.  When you have 7 billion people sharing a planet, you simply can't live by your own rules w/o compromising extensively along the way.  Every person on the planet is heavily dependent on others for their very existence.  Rand's theories sound great and have some merit, but you're bound to be frustrated if you're stuck in that idealized never, never land.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game took an enormous time to load and I had prolems with it freezing up on K-Fire.<br /><br />Also, although it said free, you can only get so far until it prompts you for an unlock code and now you have to pony up. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is interesting and fun. But I don't like being bamboozled.<br /><br />(By the way, on iPad it also said free but once again it was just a bait. And they want $7!)
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is a very interest holding book. It is one that you just don't want to put down. I would definitely reccomend this one for someone that likes thrilling romatic stories. Can't wait to finish the Fifty Shades Darker.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After reading the first two books I was really hungry for this one.  However, Mockingjay left me a little disappointed and a little frustrated.<br /><br />*** SPOILERS ***<br /><br />Katniss acts a little spoiled.  District 13 rescued a lot of other people, and none of the others require the President to make them special promises in front of an assembly of the whole district.  Beetee and Finnick don't act like that; they just get to work.  To be sure, Katniss carries a lot of damage (but so does everybody else).  For me, Katniss crossed the line when she saw evidence of President Snow's movements in the first chapter, but didn't tell anyone else.  Throughout the book, she is fighting her own revolution, and not working well with others.<br /><br />There's not enough Haymitch, not enough Beetee, not enough Gale.  Even -- not enough Effie, and I don't even like her!<br /><br />The ending is both rushed and inconclusive.  What is Katniss's relationship with her mother at the end?  Did they just stop talking to each other?!  Did Katniss and Haymitch ever sit down and clear the air?

B0082XKGGU|5.0|First, my review may be a little different because I read it from a different perspective so hopefully it sheds a little light on not just the man, but his method. Marcus Aurelius was quoted in a book about Professionalism that I have been reading and it peaked my interest as to why someone would use one quote, as one would from the Bible, if it could be out of context? My thinking was, \\"read the whole book\\". So, I did and I was very surprised to find a man who though he was a learned Stoic student, exemplified the very basic principles of what \\"Christians\\" are taught to be and also of professionalism; i.e. trust, forgiveness, straight forwardness, patience, kindness. It started to sound a lot like the seven fruits of the Spirit were imbodied in this man who was a professed pagan. I was moved by how godly, little \\"g\\", he was compared to men who profess to be Godly, big \\"G\\". If you are a professional or desire to become one, Marcus Aurelius was a Caesar and by all means embodied his title with the utmost professionalism. P.S. he repeats himself a lot, so just be prepared to realize \\"we will all die\\" and \\"all matter will be forgotten\\". Cheers!

The acting by the lead villain (The Wicked Queen) is absolutely brilliant, especially playing a dual role of Wicked Queen of a fairy tale land and playing the Mayor of a sleepy New England town. Love the spin they put on some well known fairy tales, too. Intriguing!

0316228532|3.0|Like 99.97% of everyone who has read this book so far, I am a huge \\"Harry Potter\\" fan. However, I love to read books from many genres, and I was very well aware that \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" was J.K. Rowling's foray into a whole new world. I wasn't expecting wizards or magic or broomsticks or even humor. What I was expecting was a novel that wasn't super dull to read, and unfortunately  for me, that's exactly what \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" is, from start to finish: boring, boring, boring. And my goodness, how it DRAGS! Rowling's extremely vivid descriptions and characterizations were apparent in this book, but the problem is that all of the characters are basically selfish and one-dimensional, not to mention completely uninteresting. This book paints a dark picture of the lives of the residents who inhabit a small English town and come to blows over its politics, but there's nothing for the reader to really grab onto or care about, and the pacing of the story is unbelievably slow, especially for the first half of the book.<br /><br />I don't think it's fair to call this a BAD book, but its certainly one that I thought I'd enjoy much more than I did. Some reviewers are aghast because of the sex scenes, foul language, and other adult material depicted in this book. None of that bothered me in the least. Again, I wasn't expecting another \\"Harry Potter\\" novel, and I give mad props to Rowling for wanting to try something so entirely different from her other books. I just hope that her next book is...better. I'd give \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" two and a half stars if I could, but Amazon forced me to round up to three (lucky for Rowling, I guess).

0525953728|3.0|Obviously, the story itself is amazing.  But, the book isn't well written.  Someone pointed out to me the size of the font and the spacing between lines, meant to beef up the size of the book while not having much meat to it.  I've read several \\"Special Ops\\" books, and this one feels as if the first half was just thrown together in order to get to the all-important raid.

0743201140|1.0|I bought the book new from Amazon, and my code is invalid/had already been used...From looking at previous reviews I saw this problem happened to a handful of people, I guess I am now one of those people. This sucks.
B008OJ291W|3.0|Listening to Jeff Lynne's re-recordings of the \\"very best of...\\" ELO is an odd experience. Early promotional material for this release talked about Jeff's \\"singular desire to get things right once and for all\\" and the liner notes for the release have Jeff stating he wanted to use today's technology to \\"try to get a better drum sound, a better piano sound and guitar sound\\".  Does he succeed?<br /><br />First off you can't help notice what fine voice Jeff is in.  Apart from some slight changes to phrasing it is incredible how much Jeff has nailed his lead vocals: for each track he faithfully recreates the vocal tone of the original recordings. Considering most of the originals were recorded 30 to 40 years ago I find that truly amazing! Also you can't help but be impressed with all of the attention to detail that Jeff put into recreating these recordings.<br /><br />Jeff may have succeeded in getting that better \\"sound\\" but only from a technical perspective: there is more definition between the instruments, more clarity, if you will. But I think that performance is just as important as the technical aspects of a recording and in all cases I think the originals win hands-down over these one-man performances by Jeff.<br /><br />Yes, these are, for the most part, Jeff doing everything. He's an incredible writer, producer, arranger, singer, guitarist, etc. but he is NOT an incredible drummer and while the drums may \\"sound\\" a bit sharper I think that added clarity only reveals some of the limitations of Jeff's drumming. I really do miss Bev Bevan's big drum sound even if it was not as sharply defined.<br /><br />But my biggest frustration is that Jeff has undermined all of the meticulous work and effort he put into these recordings by engaging synth-strings instead of the real thing. The strings were such an integral part of the recordings from the `70s and were the thing that originally attracted me to ELO. 1970's ELO was orchestral rock at its finest and to this day, after countless listenings, I still get chills when I hear those soaring strings. The electronic strings heard here lack warmth and sound thin and dated.<br /><br />It's an interesting collection and, again, I'm blown away by Jeff's vocal performance which is as impressive as it was over three decades ago. You have to credit the man for his musicianship and remarkable attention to detail in recreating these classics in such detail. Also \\"Point of No Return\\", which I assume is a recent effort by Jeff (the liner notes provide no details), is a must hear for any ELO devotee. But I prefer my ELO sound full, warm, rich, and WITH STRINGS! And if this is what Jeff had originally intended for ELO (to \\"get it right once and for all\\"?), then I apparently have misunderstood the man and his musical intentions for 35 years.<br /><br />This collection is for folks who already have all the rest. For casual fans who want the Electric Light Orchestra's very best WITH THE ORCHESTRA I recommended [[ASIN:B0009YNSJW All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED]]] and the companion disc [[ASIN:B001110QHE Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra 2 (Snyr)]]. The two disc [[ASIN:B005JJ0GL0 The Essential Electric Light Orchestra]] is also a very good compilation but suffers due to some edited versions of earlier hits: \\"Can't Get It Out of My Head\\" is brutally cut.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Really fun read. Developed characters, entertaining plot, and a surprising sense of humor. Well worth the purchase. If you enjoy young adult books or fantasy novels in general check this out.
B0031RSBS2|3.0|Started the book with some trepidation having read others' reviews. However found that, as usual Lee Childs weaves an engaging plot with the usual insurmountable Reacher challenges. Perhaps not quite as compelling as Tripwire (my favourite to date) but a satisfying read nevertheless.
B007IO1X5C|4.0|This book is full of thought provoking ideas and interesting examples of how market thinking has pervaded particularly the American way of life, where everything is ultimately for sale.  It often had me shaking my head at how crazy a country the US is.  But as thought provoking as the book is, it ultimately doesn't offer any guidance on how to change society or where to go from here.  In effect, the author is waving a red flag warning of danger ahead, and leaving it up to us to decide how to avoid that danger, which is still a laudable goal.  Society needs books like this that call us to question our way of life with the goal of improving it.  The book is a good eye-opener.
1433502410|5.0|I have always found the ESV bible to be dynamic in its reading of scripture. Its not too literal where the reading comes across as fragmented or choppy, and its not liberal with its translation either.<br /><br />The paragraphs flow very well and the scholarship in the study edition is bar none. As a student pastor, I can always trust using my ESV study bible, Matthew Henry, Gill, and Wycliffe as great resources when developing a sermon.

In other words, I was entertained. Isn't that what's it all about?

Just a remake of Alien and basically the same story line just different characters and and a little twist to the overall plot!

184195392X|5.0|The cosine of this irrational argument is unity, maybe something worth thinking about in this beautiful novel about reality and faith. Five stars, but Life of Pi is far from perfect - my main qualm is its unevenness. Some passages make you cry and wonder, while others feel more commonplace. I bought this book at the Waterstone's in Bloomsbury because of its gripping introduction, and its ending is even better. Somewhere around the middle it drags a bit. My other dislike is the development of the protagonist - or should I say the lack of it. Pi wasn't hard for me to like, but very hard for me to believe as a plausible person. But the originality of Life of Pi makes up for these flaws. This is by far the best religious apologist piece I've ever read, but it functions as something more than that.

B004XISI4A|3.0|Compared with the previous novels, A Dance with Dragons falls short of my expectations of the Game of Thrones series.  With previous novels the changing of character perspectives at each new chapter was an excellent device used to slow down the fast paced and brutal storyline.  However now with the story being slow and meaningless, these character changes now just slow down an already slow plot making it a chore to read.  Though you still read it to discover the plot, it does not come easily.<br />Not to say it is a bad book, it simply does not stand up to the previous instalments.<br />I was sceptical at first, so read it yourself and see.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Like many, I  purchased this book to see how it would compare to the Harry Potter books, all of which I made a point to read and thoroughly enjoyed. This is a very worthwhile read. The author has made the move to writing for adults very well, with the shortcomings as well as the gifts each of has to balance in our lived. While the characters are very well developed; I had to turn back several times to remember who was was connected to who ... and how. I finally resolved this by a simple \\"family tree\\" for each family. A good read ... actually I enjoyed this every bit as much as the Potter books.

Two weeks after we watched it my husband forgot that we had already seen it<br />(which says a lot about the movie) That being said, if you are looking for a diversion you will be entertained but it definitely isn't a film that you will be excited to talk about once it's over.

1451662432|5.0|First of all, Arnold's book has one of the most attractive dust jackets I've ever seen.  You have him on the front contrasted with the bold red title.  A white spine with his name on it in red.  And the Terminator on the back.  Even the inside cover has pictures I've never seen.  Secondly this book is packed with pictures.  Not one section in the middle, I'm talking like 5 sections.  A lot of the pre-politics discussed were a part of Education of a Bodybuilder, but he adds so much more to these stories that they are just fascinating.  The politics part was good.  Knowing some of what was going on behind the scenes explains so much.  And, despite what the media wants you to believe, the whole book is not about a love child.  It is discussed briefly and honorably.  It made the tv interviewers who talked with him look like sick sleezy psychos obsessed with disgusting details.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who looks up to great individuals.  If you are inspired by great men and women, then you need to read this book.  It is inspiring, revealing, and commendable.  Buy it, read it, give it!

0439023491|5.0|The book Catching Fire, by Suzanne Collins (2009) is the second of three books in the Hunger Games trilogy.  The first being The Hunger Games and third being Mockingjay.  I have not completed the trilogy yet, but am eager to move onto the Mockingjay soon, because of how interesting and fun the first two books have been for me to read.<br /><br /> Catching Fire picks up where the first book, The Hunger Games left off.  To begin writing about the second of Collins' (2009) work, I have to give you an idea of what the first book was about.  The setting takes place in a place similar to the U.S., but in the future.  There were civil wars and eventually one ruling group took over the entire country and they were located in the \\"Capitol.\\"  There were now \\"Districts\\" instead of states and in the first book we were made aware of 13 Districts, but the 13th was demolished after they tried to rebel over the Capitol Seventy Five years before.  Only twelve existed and as a result of their attempt sanctions were placed on every district and the Hunger Games were created.<br /><br /> The Hunger Games are an annual event where every district sends two citizens to compete to death, one boy and one girl.  The main character in the story is Katniss Everdeen (the girl).  Katniss and Peeta Mellark (the boy) both were sent and both won the games, which had never happened before.  The first book ends with them returning home as heroes and champions, but something happened as a result of their win, something deeper in their district and every other district.<br /><br /> Catching Fire picks up where the original book leaves off.  Katniss and Peeta are forced to do a victory tour of all the districts and it starts to become obvious that their win has fueled an uprising against the Capitol.  The Capitol has begun to take notice of this as well and normally Victors are treated like champions and Gods, these two are not.  They become subject to torture and constant harassment from the Capitol.  The Victors are now immune from having to compete in any future Hunger Games, but the Capitol has something different in mind.  Collins (2009) does not blame Katniss and Peeta for the new rules for the 75th Hunger Games, but you know in her writing that it is because of them the new rules have been set.<br /><br />  It is announced that they are doing something different and unheard of this year:  they are selecting two Victors from every district to compete against each other.  In their district there are only three living Victors and Katniss is the only women.  Then one male is older and was she and Peeta's mentor, Haymitch.  So Peeta is the obvious choice for the male.<br /><br /> Collins (2009) shows you the raw emotion of Katniss and her family at this point.  She takes great detail in describing exactly what they all are thinking, all the way down to Katniss going to get drunk with her mentor, Haymitch and the web of emotions that each character is having.  Each character is afraid to show emotion for many reasons:  Katniss doesn't want to upset her mother and little sister, her mother and sister don't want to show their feelings, so they don't let on to Katniss how afraid they are.  But all the while, me as the reader feels everything and everyone's raw emotion.  Katniss and Peeta are swept away and brought to the Capitol for prepping and the Hunger Games.<br /><br /> The story ends with Katniss defeating the security system in the arena during the games and her and others being removed alive.  The rebellion has removed them and the Fire has begun!  She is being transported to District 13, the one that does not exist.  Collins (2009) weaved a fantastic story from the first book The Hunger Games into Catching Fire.  I have not read the final book, but without reading it, each stands alone as an amazing story, but with the trilogy it can only be even better.<br /><br />References<br />Collins, Suzanne (2009).

B005S9EJ14|5.0|You can't beat the British star power. Maggie Smith and Judy Dench were, as always perfect in there inspiring roles.  The whole cast was great. A wonderful, heartwarming story.  While geared to the 'Boomer' generation, it has lessons for all of us.  A must see movie!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app all the time! It is so convenient and works on my phone and Kindle. Almost as great and easy as being on a regular computer.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I thought the book was well written but I still wouldn't recommend it to everyone because it is so gritty. It's like reading an episode of East Enders.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Not your space based sci-fi novel, more of a low tech mystery novel.  More of a silo underground than a space station.<br /><br />It took me awhile to get interested in the plot and I almost stopped reading, but persisted.  I was half way thru the second Chapter/book when things finally got interesting, then I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />So, I liked it, but I'm more of a spacer, hence 4 stars ****
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book!  I especial loved  all the conflict involved!and of course, my beloved coach hedge ... who is by now probably the military mascot.
1401322786|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book.  I borrowed it from my local library (trying to do my part to keep libraries going) and I am glad I did not spend the money for it.  It was annoying to read, always jumping around.  I actually read it in one day because I kept wanting it to get better.  Mitch's books are always good, but he really should have left this one out of his portfolio.  The premise of this book has been done before and really, he didn't bring anything new to it.  I really like Mitch Albom, his books, his articles and his radio broadcasts are always worth listening to.  This book, however, was one I could have easily skipped.  Looking forward to seeing what he comes up with next.

184195392X|5.0|I heard of this book first through the trailer for the film, soon to be released, by director Ang Lee. Mr. Lee, doesn't pick up garbage, so despite what appeared initially, to be a somewhat silly idea, I bought the book. The fact that my wife and I usually prefer animals as company to most humans was another inducement.<br /><br />Within the initial pages of the novel, author Martel, Man-Booker Prize winner, introduces an intellectual challenge: to paraphrase, do you want to hear a story that will make you see God? How could I refuse such a challenge? Of course I want to hear the story!<br /><br />Guess what? It did.<br /><br />This is one of the most amazing books I've read in a long time. No. probably the very best in twenty years or so. I brought no real expectations, being unaware of the writer's work. I am now a confirmed Martel fanboy. Everything about the crafting of the story, the pacing, the absolutely unforgettable characters -- especially Richard (No, I won't tell you who he is...) and the perfect twist of a conclusion suggest I recommend this novel as highly as I can. I think it can honestly change peoples lives. Read it soon.<br /><br />By the way, despite several reviews to the contrary, the only thing this book has in common with Hemingway's Old Man & The Sea is salt water.
B002OR0RP0|5.0|Found this movie to be very entertaining.  This movie would be well received by all age groups.  I look forward to more of these movies.
0441172717|4.0|It took me a little bit to get into the book because of the (albeit necessary) complicated, lengthy exposition.  Once I got a handle on the characters and backplot, however, it was difficult to put this novel down.  I enjoyed the character development and the relationships between them.  I see why it is a classic!
B007THA4FI|2.0|Not my cup of tea. Filled with bad language. Story was just too predictable. There was no one in the story that I felt connected to. Nothing to get excited about. I would not recommend this book.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's kind of addictive and fun to play and thebtype of game to waste time or wind down with. It's free so worth a try - nothing to lose.  I'm sure my kids will be fighting over it.
0307593525|5.0|I can't add anything substantial to the years of superlatives showered on these volumes. 'Mastering' scares some people - but it shouldn't. If you are reasonably competent in the kitchen, can carefully follow instructions, and pay attention to details like measurements, temperatures and time, you'll be more than happy to keep this set handy. Of course, if your idea of preparing meals involves mostly frozen items in boxes or bags, a microwave and a spork, well, 'Mastering The Art of French Cooking' probably shouldn't be your first choice in cookbooks.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was repelled, disgusted, depressed, but mostly bored. But I kept forcing myself to read because it just had to get better, right? Wrong. It was Awful.  Dismal.  Depressing. Sad. Dirty. Tragic. The mind who created Voldemort and the Dementers created this book.
B000FA5STS|4.0|Fast moving, great characters, vintage Baldacci.  Could not put the book down.  Only downside (small one) at times it was hard to keep all the characters straight.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|I grew up in the 80's and love all kinds of music from the era... that being said, I found only two words describe this movie. PAIN. FULL.<br />I couldn't get through it and turned it off half way through....<br />The singing was on par with mid-level local karaoke (but with far less passion that your average drunkard reliving his/her glory years at the local bar) and the acting and the story line was just plain bad. And all from big name stars, no less.<br />I suppose the fact that I find most musicals difficult to watch - and the fact that I didn't realize this whole movie was a musical - meant my experience was doomed from the start...<br />So, unless you're a huge fan of musicals and hair bands, I'd listen to the critics who panned it and avoid...
B008H6GH8I|5.0|so they up'd the CGI from degeneration and made the story line even better. This is a perfect lead into resident evil 6. you already got leon and ada but the new characters are easily likable. its a movie worth watching plus its a good 1 hr 40 min with great special features
B004P1JEWU|5.0|What a great read! Every book is better than the last. Can't wait till I can read the next one.

Everything goes back to normal and viola - happy ending!
B002L9N4F6|5.0|This is a great gift for the Forrest Gump lover in your life. The discs are in a chocolate candy box. Very quaint and cutesy. A nice piece of memorabilia, as well.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The story develops much better...there is a lot of hot and cold and up and down, but it works...it keeps you interested in characters...Eva grows so much and Gideon has a strange way of growing but does...they learn to be better for each other and when when they are at their most frustrating the author finds a way to redeem them...
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is so addictive but you cant waste much time on it unless you buy the coins. It may take you 7 min at the most to get rid of all the coins you have and then you have to wait to get more. I like that it makes you think to win.
0374280967|3.0|Everyone who reads on a regular basis knows about the addictive features of such an adventure. As the author leads us to believe the Queen of England simply lacked the time for such things until one day while chasing down her disruptive and incorrigible Corgi's she encounters a young man in the book mobile. Norman as it turns out is employed in the Royal kitchens but is a bookophile. In the coming months he guides the Monarchial pursuit of all things written including his apparent penchant for gay authors. Even after Norman's untimely disappearance her Majesty begins to redefine her challenge to consume as many books as is literally possible. In doing so she finds herself ignoring or at least giving short shrift to her official duties which despite her love of all things regal has started to find them if not boring at least disruptive of her new found regime.<br /><br />The problem with excessive reading as any ignored spouse or best friend can tell you is that reading is a decidedly singular excursion with the annoying exception of the occasional \\"Listen to this...\\" followed by an extracontextual paragraph or so which the listener does not want to hear. The cure of course for reading to exclusion is to write. Will this be the remedy for the good Queen or will she resort to something more drastic? Her attendants and personal handlers conspire to find the solution but of course she takes the bull, as it were, by the horns and preempts them with her usual decisiveness on the burm of her 80th birthday.<br /><br /> A lovely fast read. Alan Bennett is a cheeky Brit with a rather large repertoire to his credit including plays, essays, novels, reviews and the odd appearance on stage. 2.50 GIBO
B008IGP8RI|2.0|Wasn't nearly as entertaining as listening to it in the movie.<br />Sounded more like listening to a radio program.  Wished I had been able to preview it first.  Wouldn't have purchased.
B008220DIC|2.0|Every once in a while, a film is created by a visionary director at the top of his game, with memorable performances from some of the best actors working today, resulting in a cohesive, moving and powerful story that fully resonates with me.<br /><br />This is not one of those times.<br /><br />The Master is populated by unlikable characters who do nothing to redeem themselves at any point in the film.<br /><br />The bulk of the story takes place in 1950. Freddie Quell (Phoenix) is an able-bodied seaman who has trouble adapting to life after the war. He may have been mentally disturbed before that, but we aren't shown enough of his background to make that determination.<br /><br />We are shown something of Quell's attempts to hold down a regular job -- he seems to have a gift for photography -- but he's quick to anger and attacks one of his customers without apparent provocation. He's also an alcoholic, and we see him drinking all manner of questionable substances, some of which appear to be potentially lethal. When he's accused of poisoning someone with one of his concoctions, he seeks refuge on a ship.<br /><br />This is where the film gives the audience a glimmer of hope that it will develop into something interesting. This ship is run by Lancaster Dodd (Hoffman), who claims to be a writer, doctor, nuclear physicist, theoretical philosopher, and a great many more things. Dodd is fascinated by human beings and psychology, and wants to understand Quell and help him with his obvious anger issues. Dodd has his own way of doing things and his psychoanalysis produces the most memorable scenes in the movie.<br /><br />Dodd is married to Peggy (Adams), but she's just as unpleasant as the rest of the characters. She barely had any lines, and most of the ones she did have were obscene.<br /><br />Quell frequently fantasizes about women, as outlined in an early masturbation scene on the beach with a girl fashioned out of sand. This theme is continued when he pictures women naked at a gathering.<br /><br />If this were a story about Dodd's quest to heal Quell, I might be satisfied with it, but the plot meanders along without any obvious conclusion.<br /><br />I consider myself a patient viewer, and I appreciate all manner of films that have slow plots, hidden messages, and flawed characters. Unfortunately, The Master left me disappointed.<br /><br />The final 30 minutes were thought-provoking. I found myself thinking whether I should walk out, and whether anyone would mind if I were to take off my right shoe and scratch my foot. I also wondered whether time was moving differently all of a sudden, and if this was the same Paul Thomas Anderson who gave is There Will Be Blood and Magnolia.<br /><br />The individual components of the film were mostly in place; the acting was fine, the cinematography and score worked, and Anderson presented a convincing picture of New York in the 1950s. What wasn't present was a coherent story or a reason to care about these miserable characters.<br /><br />I doubt that Amy Adams will ever work for Disney again after some of the words that came out of her mouth.naked at a gathering.<br /><br />If this were a story about Dodd's quest to heal Quell, I might be satisfied with it, but the plot meanders along without any obvious conclusion.<br /><br />I consider myself a patient viewer, and I appreciate all manner of films that have slow plots, hidden messages, and flawed characters.

031603441X|5.0|I had very low expectations for this book.  I mean honestly, even if Keith Richards could remember half of what happened to him on his amazing drug-laced journey, how well could he scribble it down on paper?  Surprisingly well, is the answer.  Keith does a very nice job of keeping to the script, keeping the story on track, but hinting at things to come.  Like Mick and his ego running amok.  Not that life with Mr. Richards was any picnic!  Keith is astoundingly honest and frank about all of his relationships, including his relationship with smack.  It is an amazing life and, thus, Life is a highly entertaining read.  As for me, I finally put all of my guitars into opening tuning and, thanks to Keith Richards, am having a blast rediscovering the guitar.  Thanks, Keef!
B007SGM084|5.0|You will not want to put your reader down...Very ' steamy' books. Might put fire back in those relationships that have gotten complacent over the Yeats.
B0038AUYKU|5.0|The book \\"[[ASIN:1400031567 Sidetracked: A Kurt Wallander Mystery (5)]]\\" was good to read, sometimes a little disturbing but a well thought out plot. The English language is rather unsophisticated.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Not a fan... It may just not be my type of book.  Lot of slang in the first chapter which drove me crazy.  Second Chapter just didn't keep my interest... and I stopped there.  I hear it gets vastly better, but I cannot bring myself to read anymore.  Will wait for the movie.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie sets the standard for what has become the norm in film making. It is,  make a \\"good enough movie\\" and and then just make the sequels preatty much a prequel to the third movie. No substance or resolution to the problem presented and the ending presents a problem that you can only fing in a 3rd , and the resolution of the third is in the fourth. No thanks if my kids want to see it I'll borrow it from my  friend.
0316228532|1.0|I couldn't even finish this book. When I picked it up. I assumed it was fantasy. I love to read, But since I have ADHD. After the first chapter. My attention started to wonder. Tell I finely gave up. I personally thought it was boring and slightly crude. Thou I would have looked past the crudeness for a good fantasy.
0345803485|5.0|I, had heard about this book, from several friends, mixed reviews by all, but most found it to be a very good Love Story, spiced up a little. I,really enjoyed it!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I enjoy it overall, put a good few hours into it. I just wish I could get puzzle pieces faster. Maybe faster coins too?
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is the most exciting,creative,informative, mind boggling app I've experienced in a long time.  I've had the occasional incident of the app stopping, but I'm always able to get back to my spot.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I have listened to Monster at least 10 times since Tuesday and I have to say that it is KISS 2012 successfully capturing that familiar KISS mode of the 1970s.  It delivers on what the weak and phoned-in Sonic Boom album tried to do back in 2009.  While I wish Peter and Ace were still with the band, I have to say that Tommy and Eric have finally gelled with Gene And Paul.  Of course nothing will have the chemistry of the original band, but Gene, Paul, Tommy and Eric have a chemistry now that is a very very close second to the original lineup and way better than any of the 80s lineups.  I can't pick a favorite song on Monster because it is a great listen all the way through.  Gene's sings like his demon persona and his bass playing is great on Wall Of Sound, Back to The Stone Age and The Devil Is Me.  I wasn't crazy about Hell Or Hallelujah when I downloaded it, but the song sounds better on CD and Paul also sounds fantastic on Freak, Shout Mercy and Last Chance.  Tommy's song Outta This World is a nice tip of the hat and answer to Ace's Outer Space from Ace's 2009 Anomoly CD.  And while Eric's All For The Love Of Rock & Roll is a nice tip of the hat to Peter, I would love to actually hear Peter sing that song!<br /><br />But even as great as this album is, a new KISS album will never come without a few honest criticisms from fans. So here is my one and only gripe:<br /><br />I had read the Best Buy Edition was to come with a hidden bonus track called Right Here Right Now in addition to a sticker and KISS Army membership.  Well I was disappointed to find out it was just the sticker and membership.  But the bonus track is available on iTunes so I thought I would buy it for $0.99 only to find out that Right Here Right Now is an \\"Album Only\\" purchase.  So I had to buy the whole album again, which fortunately was discounted because I bought Hell or Hallelujah last summer, just to get Right Here Right Now.  The song is great, but I would have liked to have it on the disc!So now that I have purchased the album twice and have made sure that the band's monthly balance sheet is bigger, can I get a Free T Shirt and Tour Program?<br /><br />So do I recommend Monster?  Of Course!  It is great to see that KISS has joined Alice Cooper, Van Halen, Heart, Lita Ford, Slash, Rush, Cheap Trick and Heaven & Hell in releasing vital new albums at this stage of their careers.  We are less than a month away from Aerosmith's new album and I would love to see them join this list!

0887431453|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old and it's aweseome. Great price and the activities range from stuff for 2 1/2 to around 5 (depending on child's level). I would recommend this to parents who want to prepare children for preschool or to support what your child is already learning in preschool.

B007THA4FI|5.0|I read the reviews before I bought the book (they almost persuaded me not to buy it).  I'm glad I trusted my instincts.  I found this to be a truly good story.  I think Ms. Rowling took an ordinary setting and premise and brought them to life extraordinarily well.  She certainly understands human nature and shares that understanding with great wit.  I don't know if she intended it, but I think she also manages to teach a life lesson on the mess we can all make of things when we let our lives become self-centered.  I'd recommend this book to any adult and, certainly, any parent.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book should be required for anyone inclined to desire that men  go into combat.  the sheer, inglorious hell  is spoken of so plainly, and without guile.  there is so little personal embellishment from Dr Sledge, that it makes the story that much more compelling.  This book is not, however for those looking for a strategic view of these battles.  A great , if sobering read
B00992CF6W|5.0|for everyone out there who got the app on 4shared before it came out you should buy this app like me its awesome and if you get inveditor you can get water and lava. plus if you still use the illegally downloaded version notch can sue you.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|I framed a picture of Gandhi today - and of course, the film floated around in the ruminations which followed...<br /><br />The emotions which stirred within while framing this picture of Gandhi very much resembled the feelings of loving reverence and humility I feel every time I see this film. There is this sense of gentle-kindness and simultaneously, tremendous power and strength emanates from this great master...<br /><br />For a movie to ignite thoughts and emotions so powerful, poignant, profound and moving, it quite simply has to be a top-notch film. Gandhi, hands down, stands alone as one of the greatest films I have ever seen in all of my life. I am inclined to say THE greatest film, but as I said, it stands alone. There really is no movie I can compare it to...<br /><br />Ben Kingsley is absolutely masterful in this role. He becomes Gandhi in such an awesome way. If I watch film clips of Gandhi and try to compare them to Kingsley acting as Gandhi...I mean, I CAN'T tell the difference! Kingsley brilliantly weaves the love and humility with the great power, strength and wisdom of Gandhi's personality and real-life story. And I have had a few express their disagreement, but Kingsley's role as Gandhi is THE best acting I have ever seen yet...the best!

0385344333|5.0|Lee Child is a rare author, consistently brilliant. I have found all of his books, including this one, to be excellent.<br /> Some authors start strong and fade over time, others seem to have written some so-so earliy works but have come on strong recently.<br />  I have read every one of the Jack Reacher novels and I am incredibly impressed at just how good each one is.<br />If you are new to Reacher, start at the beginning, and read them in order. It is not critical to do it that way but I believe you will find it more enjoyable.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|To be honest I had never seen Singing in the Rain before I purchased it on Bluray, but I am glad I hadn't. Not only is the storyline perfect and representative of classic older muscials, but the Film Quality is breath taking. If you like old movies and have a bluray player and HD television, BUY this!! You won't regret it.

B000FBJFSC|3.0|This story is probably very beautiful. With that being said, I'm only roughly 2% through. The main issue that I have is the lack of quotation marks.

0316017930|1.0|Let's start off with a simple, easily agreed to premise: Gladwell's books have been met largely with positive support from critics. The bestseller lists, scattered with his name, tell the same story: the man's ideas are thought provoking. You can't argue with sales. Or can you? (see that? I have read his books.)<br /><br />The success of Gladwell's books hinges not just on the genius of his thought, but rather he stupidity of his audience. Americans are all idiots. They are taught only math and science, perform rather poorly in both, and cut funding to humanities because their school's purpose is to produce miniature Mint Romneys. Superfluous? No.<br /><br />The effete businessmen (and yes, they are all men. Women only succeed when they act like men. See the Yahoo CEO's maternity leave) produced by the 'top tier' American 'schools' are the only people who read this dreck. Evidence? My inbox at work is overflowing with emails from those same nancies quoting Gladwell in the footer. The Vapid leading the vapid. What makes Gladwell their scion is what makes their lives so useless: they are unable to define and express obvious concepts without reverting to superficial financial concepts. When someone does, look out! Genius!<br /><br />My tone is possibly taking away from the immensity of this book's genius. Revelatory points (SPOILER ALERT!!!): 1. Did you know that higher achievers may have had opportunities unavailable to myself, a loser (Don't get me wrong, I obviously think I'm better than you.)? Okay, scrape your brains off the desk and try to return them, it gets better. 2. They were probably more talented in that specific area to begin with? I had to put the book down here. The first I had an inkling of, this was out of left field. 3. That after they put in 10,000 hours they became inordinately successful. What? That explains how I manage to walk so well.<br /><br />This book is a waste of time. If you like it, your interest may be peaked by my Book \\"How a House isBuilt: It's not the builders, it's the people who pay them\\", or one of Bill Simmons 'columns' or 'books' (how has that guy not won a pulitzer?).

1476712042|3.0|This book was about two people who drink too much in my opinion and also go to the same college, and are involved in a variety of weird activities (apart from the drinking) like clandestine fights and illegal poker games. And they fall into a tough love relationship that has a surprising happy ending.<br />Travis is a prick \\"bagging\\" the whole school in his couch. He is rude, unnerving,  has some really serious anger management issues,  made poor Abbie endure a whole night of \\"bagging\\" with two girls in the infamous couch while her heart shattered inside the room. Beat the crap put of several different people throughout the book. I mean he is just awful. And he never got arrested even though he assaulted other students in the school.<br />He gets inked and she freaks out for no reason because, first of all: no one can read a tattoo in hebrew. And second her real name is not pigeon so what was the big deal then. I don't know. I also don't know where the nickname came from.<br />Once they start dating he is a jerk to everyone but I guess it's okay because he loves her.<br />Well around the middle of the book he changed into this completely different person, thoughtful, romantic, over protective boyfriend and that was nice for a change, but then Abbie also changed into this queen of poker and  it was so ridiculous the whole trip to Vegas was just one stupid thing after the other. The man in Vegas tells her he remembers her from 6 years ago..... When she was 13? And the job offer Travis ends up nailing? ... ... ...<br />Towards the end Travis transforms once again into an emotional wreck. Yikes.<br />Last but not least: why was chapter thirteen missing?
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Follett has done it again.  This book is engaging and exciting.  There are no dull moments and it is hard to find a good stopping point when it is time to put it down and go to bed.  In addition to the excitement and good entertainment, I learned a lot about the genesis and conduct of WW I.  A great read.  I can't wait to dig in to the next in the series. Another good book from Amazon [[ASIN:0741459647 A Divine Destiny: Memoirs of a Medic]]
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was completly surprised by the ending!  This was a love story, and a suspense story all in one.  In short,   I loved it and can‘t wait to read the next.
B001NLJ33K|2.0|With a good cast and a big budget with a great locale, this one should have been a lot better.<br />The music is good and the action scenes are well done but that's about it. The plot is okay but the dialogue is just horrible. Most of the characters seem content in just looking good and style is definitely emphasized over any substance. How does a vice cop afford a designer wardrobe anyway? And why do they cast a Chinese woman as a Cuban? Yes she is atractive but she also looks Chinese.<br />Other than water, the Miami locale is mostly wasted. They do have land there also but they seem to miss that. Too much of this movie looks like they are posing for still shots. I'd only give it 1.5 stars.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Yes, it is true, a number of these hits can be loved in their original versions just fine.  However, some of the new sounds revitalize some of the oldest tunes from the early albums (\\"Can't Get it OUt of My Head\\", and  \\"10538 Overture.\\"  There is a brand new song as well, \\"Point of No Return\\" and it is a good song, and a must add for ELO fans.  I do think there are better versions of \\"Do Ya\\" already, but an acoustic version of Steppin' Out, with Richard Tandy on piano really sounds like a different song, and is very well done.  This is for fans who just now discovered ELO or for long time fans of Jeff Lynne.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|He desmistifies the importance of the outcomes.  When you think about such long runs and about doing that for most of your life you realize it really has to be about the love for the process.  The benefit from race training and life style implications to Jurek's routine and the way he chooses to be in the world are the ultimate goals.  For that matter the book really applies to anyone seeking confort or understanding why \\"we just to things\\" (a quote he often uses throughout the book).  Fun read.

B000002KXV|5.0|Donald Fagen's solo debut is the apotheosis of genius!  He somehow took a blend of jazz, rock, reggae, blues, country, latin, soul, etc., mixed it with intelligence, innovation, vulnerability, foresight, romance, history, humor, and heart to make an instant classic.  What really blows my mind is that he was all of 34 years old at the time.  His youth belied his seamless mastery, for this came after all of those mindblowing Steely Dan albums from the '70s.  It's no wonder many of the world's greatest musicians tout him as one of their favorite artists.  The late great Mel Torme called Donald, \\"One of my greatest teachers.\\"<br /><br />Now 30 years old, The Nightfly sounds as fresh as it did in 1982. Donald's refusal to compromise his artistic ideals is the main reason.  His incredible attention to detail and obvious deep love of music is evident. How many artists can that be said of? Donald Fagen is a gem, a true genius, innovator, and legend.  I'm proud to be one of his most ardent fans and students and am ecstatic that he is still recording high-quality music in 2012!! Sunken Condos, Morph the Cat, Kamakiriad (as well as 11 Tracks of Whack and Circus Money, the solo sets from his partner Walter Becker) and the entire Steely Dan catalog comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! They NEVER disappoint.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was selected to read for my bookclub last month.  After all the hype about it, I was really anxious to read it.  However, as I started reading I wondered how this book became popular.  It's just thrashy and the story line while decent could have been handled a lot better. I had to ask myself several times while reading...I'm a grown woman why am I reading this book? While I'm aware that that the main characters are young (I have no problem with that), how many times must I read \\"holy cow\\" in a novel.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is not a book for anyone looking for happy love stories.  It is true to the series but you do need t read the first two books recently or have a good memory.
B00000F214|3.0|If you just want a Blu Ray copy of the movie this is Fine.  If you want lots of great xtras and the exact same 1080p wide screen quality as the Blu Ray for much less money then get the Usual Suspects 2 disk Special Edition DVD.  I have both<br />so I know what I am talking about.  I played both on my 42 in.

087349976X|1.0|This author gives no detailed instructions on how to do the projects pictured.  There is one photo of the finished project...not pictures of the actual process of making the projects.  The instructions do tell you how long to cut a piece of wire and what tool to use, but then states \\"BEND THE WIRE ACCORDING TO THE DIAGRAM\\"!  The \\"diagram\\" shows the separate pieces of the finished project but NOT how to make them...for example \\"make the first bend 1 inch down the wire\\" or \\"use the small end of the round nose pliers to make a small coil\\" (rather than using the large end to make a large coil).  I tried making 3 projects, using a LOT of my time and wire and becoming very frustrated, before doing something I rarely do.....GIVING UP!  I gave up on this book.  I advise NOT BUYING this \\"Lack of Instruction Book\\" when there are so many good ones out there!

0765348276|5.0|I would like to add my toast to John Scalzi.  Old Man's War is poignant, exciting and entertaining.  In my lifetime of reading, this is one of the rare jewels.  A book I could not put down and one I keep returning to visit.  All I have read by Mr. Scalzi is well crafted, but this one is an exquisite masterpiece and well deserves all the praise it has garnered.  I regret that it took me so long to find it.  I will not miss anymore of Mr. Scalzi's tales.

055357342X|5.0|This book is absolutely gut-wrenching. There is a scene in this book where you fell as if you have been punched so hard that the wind has been knocked out of you. George R.R. Martin is one of the great fantasy writers of our time. He writes the chapters from different points of view being able to leave cliffhangers at the end of each chapter. No character is safe and anyone of them could die at any time. George R.R. Martin is a writer that knows how to build suspense and absolutely stun you with the climax. If you haven't read this series, GET ON IT. Fantasy books do not get much better than this.

0805095535|5.0|You are swept along by Auster's candid and well-written memoir. Winter Journal begins with events that sere your memory: the wounds that scar your body--each has its story. You are six years old...ten...twelve and even in your sixties you recall with stark clarity each bloody incident. Auster points out memory is a curious thing; certain childhood events it imprints indelibly.<br /><br />The author elects to write his memoir in the second person--and to great effect. Whereas the introspective, egocentric first person focuses the reader's attention on the narrator, Auster's more familiar \\"you\\" invites his audience to reflect on their own experiences, whether they are similar to the author's or not. And in this way the memoirist opens his life to you.<br /><br />Auster moves next from the flashbacks of youth to lodging, the many places he resided during his restless years (New Jersey, Carmen Hall, Columbia U., Manhattan, Paris...) and uses their addresses as points of reference to chronicle the events and experiences that occur during his stay at each.<br /><br />Because we are biological creatures, coming of age and sex are significant milestones in our lives. Auster shares his experiences and intimate relationships in this rite of passage openly, yet tactfully. The death of a parent is a biological passage, too, and it is here the thread of mortality enters the memoir. The author's account of the sudden, untimely death of his mother from a heart attack (Auster had had a phone conversation with her just three days prior) is tender, touching,--and horrifying. Auster receives a phone call from his mother's cleaning woman who had let herself into the apartment and discovered his mother dead. An hour and half later Auster is at her bedside. As he looks upon his mother in death, Auster shares this heartrending observation: \\"You have seen several corpses in the past and you are familiar with the inertness of the dead, the inhuman stillness that envelops the bodies of the no longer living, but none of these corpses belonged to your mother, no other dead body was the body in which your life began....\\"<br /><br />Auster grieves her death by trying to reconstruct the person he believed his mother to be and realizes, as most of us will, that though our parents are pivotal in our lives, perhaps we don't know them as well as we think. Some parts of their lives, their thoughts, remain mysteries; they withhold certain secrets and these they take to their graves.<br /><br />The author concludes his memoir with allusions to the Twin Towers and the death camp Bergen-Belsen, both of which remind us of the capriciousness of life, its randomness, its fragility--its finality. Auster poses the personal but universal question more commonly pondered by those of us of his generation: \\"How many mornings do I have left?\\" Winter Journal is a wonderfully written memoir, honest in its telling, thought-provoking in its content.

B008PE9GSA|3.0|All right, all right, so it sounded good on paper--Rick Rubin with ZZ Top, but you can't always hit the ball out of the park every time. Rick Rubin did nothing for ZZ Top here. In fact, it just sounds like ZZ Top. I can't even tell that Rick Rubin worked on this album. Also, ZZ Top have finally made an album lacking in wit, innovation and adventure. Say what you must about \\"Mescalero\\", but you can't argue that of the 17 tracks there was a whole lot of experimentation on that album at least. Here, there's nothing but a band revisiting their 70's roots.<br /><br />I listened to all of ZZ Top's albums in sequential order prior to listening to \\"La Futura\\", and those reviewers who are telling you that the band has not, in fact, gone back to their roots are lying. They have. They totally sound like their 70's selves here. But, there's nothing new here. No twists, no turns, no hooks, really. Now let's address a few things here: 1. The loudness war--well I'm tired of people complaining about it. Yes, it exists, but it's never 'ruined' any album for me where the volume is cranked up. I don't care, you hear me. So stop complaining about it. 2. 36 minutes in length. You know what, that's how long their 70's albums were!!! So, once again, stop complaining about the length of the album. 36 minutes is the perfect length. Some of their previous albums, namely \\"Mescalero\\", \\"Rhythmeen\\" and \\"Antenna\\" were over-long bloated affairs, and they could have each been trimmed down for the better. 3. Rick Rubin. Well, it's not his fault the boys are out of ideas now is it? I mean, who's idea was it to set blues to new wave syncopated drum machines and rhythms? Bill Ham? No, it was Billy Gibbons, and so, it is Billy Gibbons that I blame for being uninspired this time around.<br /><br />And so we arrive at \\"La Futura's\\" songs. Well, there isn't much to say is there? I mean it sounds like ZZ Top, and there are no radio hits here at all. Nothing. If you pressed me hard I would say that \\"I Gotsa Get Paid\\", \\"Chartreuse\\", \\"Consumption\\" and \\"Flyin' High\\" are the best tracks here, but that's not saying much. So why three stars then and not one star?<br /><br />Well, first, I have liked ZZ Top since I was 10 years old in 1983. They left an impression on me at that age with their videos on MTV, and it wasn't until 1985's \\"Afterburner\\" that I bought an album from them, and I've never looked back. For better or worse. Now you can criticize \\"Afterburner\\" and \\"Eliminator\\", but the simple fact is that Billy Gibbons was genius then for taking the blues and setting it to New Wave music. Genius I tell you. Unfortunately, he got trapped in that box.<br /><br />Now, there is a track on \\"La Futura\\" that has a coda in it that could have been a great song and a new musical direction for the band that might have spruced them up a bit. The track is \\"It's Too Easy Manana\\". At the end, the boys suddenly grab this funky little jam and then it's all over too soon. I kept thinking, \\"This is where they needed to go here. Something innovative--the blues set to funk. The boys have flirted with this over the years, but they've never given it its due.\\"<br /><br />So, in retrospect, it might have been more interesting if the boys had gone with a different producer--maybe one less obvious--like Timbaland, or Kid Rock, or heck, let's get all experimental and go with Brian Eno or Daniel Lanois. Hell, I bet even Trent Reznor would have made for an interesting collaboration.<br /><br />So, there is one point I agree with that others have made: 9 years for this??? I agree. Way too long, for way too little. Should the boys retire? Hmmm, well, no. Here's why: The blues only gets better with age. I'm really liking Billy Gibbons rough croak of a voice now. I think it lends to the bluesy authenticity. He no longer has to fake it now. The trick for ZZ Top is to find a new muse, and Rick Rubin wasn't it. That's okay. \\"La Futura\\" isn't bad, it just isn't refreshing.<br /><br />Here's how \\"La Futura\\" compares with previous ZZ Top albums:<br /><br />1971 ZZ Top's First Album: Three Stars<br />1972 Rio Grande Mud: Three and a Half Stars<br />1973 Tres Hombres: Five Stars<br />1975 Fandango!: Three Stars<br />1976 Tejas: Five Stars<br />1979 Deguello: Four Stars<br />1981 El Loco: Three Stars<br />1983 Eliminator: Five Stars<br />1985 Afterburner: Five Stars<br />1990 Recycler: Three and a Half Stars<br />1994 Antenna: Three Stars<br />1996 Rhythmeen: Three and a Half Stars<br />1999 XXX: Three Stars<br />2003 Mescalero: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 La Futura: Three Starsmpares with previous ZZ Top albums:<br /><br />1971 ZZ Top's First Album: Three Stars<br />1972 Rio Grande Mud: Three and a Half Stars<br />1973 Tres Hombres: Five Stars<br />1975 Fandango!: Three Stars<br />1976 Tejas: Five Stars<br />1979 Deguello: Four Stars<br />1981 El Loco: Three Stars<br />1983 Eliminator: Five Stars<br />1985 Afterburner: Five Stars<br />1990 Recycler: Three and a Half Stars<br />1994 Antenna: Three Stars<br />1996 Rhythmeen: Three and a Half Stars<br />1999 XXX: Three Stars<br />2003 Mescalero: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 La Futura: Three Stars

B006CEKYPE|5.0|There are several overlaying plans and plots with many independent scenes from the era (1962). Is it wiser to go off to school or stay local? What are the consequences of your intent and then final action on friends and loved ones.<br /><br />Yep everyone sees themselves in this movie. I have to admit I do also. That is see all the others as of courses I am above that sort of thing. This is one of the closest depictions of life with out me having to pull out the 8mm and filming. I spent some time in L.A. around the era and moved to Texas to find that distance changes something's but not that way of life. While in Vietnam I was even able to exchange the same urban legends with people from different part of the US.<br />I am more surprised that George Locus could capture this so well. I am also amazed at the crew they were able to assemble for this film. Most of them went off to do bigger and better parts and it is fun to watch this film in hind sight. Everyone look so young. I really never noticed Harrison Ford until Star Wars.<br /><br />Getting away from memory lane, the film is so smooth that you forgot that you are watching a movie and the actors do not overwhelm the characters that they play.<br /><br />Starting out you notice a song or two and think where was I. Then a few more songs and you soon are more rapped up in the music than the story. Having Wolfman Jack there added a touch of reality. I can not put my finger on it but there was something more than formula in this particular movie.<br /><br />I am not that sensitive but the ending hits you hard as you realize it will never be the same. This is true of any group in any era. I can almost forget that.<br /><br />By the way the original T-bird styling is back. All in all this is one film that will not collect dust.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002O81 41 Original Hits From The Soundtrack Of American Graffiti]]
B006LSZECO|3.0|After seeing this book, Gone Girl, on the NYT Best Seller List for many months, I thought it would be worth reading.  Unfortunately, I found it slow and predictible with an unsatisfactory ending.  I probably should have seen that coming.  It didn't take long to understand that things were not as they appeared and to figure out what was coming next.  Neither of the main characters was appealing.  After slogging through to the end, there should have been some kind of retribution.

B000TGJ80S|5.0|This is first rate film making beginning with the casting of Gary Oldman as Dracula.  He's one of the best actors around. I loved what was done with the story. So much more dimension to the Dracula character as well as more fully drawn additional characters. Making this a love story finally gives it motivation.  This film is really a work of art visually.  Eiko Ishioka's costume designs are creative master pieces, magnificent. The design work of the film flows from her beautiful work. For years I only had the VHS, then someone borrowed it and never returned it so I purchased the DVD with it's full disk of Extra Features. It was such a treat to get this additional insight into the creation of the film, including an interview with Eiko and a brief discussion of her concepts. In addition, the Copola's both discuss how they worked on and created the film. I don't want to short change the other design work including lighting, sets, camera work, direction & editing. All combine to create a rich, beautiful film.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|I've used more than a handful of USB/Firewire interfaces over the past decade. In the past, it's always been a crapshoot, regardless of brand or reputation. Instability, incompatability, and frustration abound with audio interfaces. That being said, this has been the best interface I've ever owned.<br /><br />The size is fantastic, the preamps sound great, it has phantom power, it looks cool, and most importantly, it's been rock solid ever since I installed it two and a half months ago.<br /><br />I frequently leave my PC on 24 hours a day with this plugged in, and as of yet I haven't had a single crash, dropout, 'pop' etc. It's performed flawlessly since day one.<br /><br />Regarding sound quality, my recordings have never sounded better. I've used this to record electric guitar straight into the unit, acoustic guitar via condenser mics, dynamic mics, hammered dulcimer, cello, synth via direct input, and it handles it all flawlessly. I'm seriously impressed with the quality.<br /><br />Finally, it's small enough to take with me when I want to record at a friends house on my laptop.<br /><br />I've used it with Reaper, Sonar X1, Guitar Rig 5, Cubase LE, all without a hitch, on two PC's - Both Win 7 64-bit. The drivers gave me no hassle installing, and as I said above, ROCK SOLID.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, as I stated earlier audio interfaces can be quite the crap shoot. Same setup, same hardware, etc, and one person can have wildly differing results. That being said, I would definitely recommend this unit, as it is my favorite of all time, and I've used everything from crappy firewire mixers to high-end MOTU interfaces.<br /><br />Great for the price, and if 2-in/2-out works for you, it should perform better than interfaces costing twice as much. It performs better than my old MOTU 828 mkII that I got for five hundred.
0596009208|4.0|Head First Java is a great book to learn Java. The book has a very interesting teaching concept that make the material stick in your brain. I would recommend beginners to try and type in every sample codes and exercises in the book. If you want to be good with Java, you have to practice and practice. Reading only is not enough! On the bad side, the book has some typos with the sample codes.

B008PNBU30|5.0|I had given a 2/5 review about 9 months ago, hearing it the first time for me sounded so weird because of their previous 3 albums but then I sat down and listened to it again. When I heard it a second time around I was amazed. Even though it is not the Grunge, Metal feel of their first two albums, it has maturity in this one. A clear departure of their previous sound but retaining the energy and distinction of what is Three Days Grace.<br /><br />The album opens with one of my favorite songs of TDG &#34;Sign of the Times&#34;. The song is a vibrant uplifter with a different feel of any opener on an album they've had.<br /><br />The rest of the album is comprised of wonderful and edgy tracks like: The High Road, Happiness, Unbreakable Heart, Expectations and Chalk Outline.<br /><br />The album is surely debatable as to being different but it is worth more than one listen to understand its meaning and sound.
B000ASATZ8|3.0|The movie itself was good but two of the tapes were warped. Tremors the legend was best it should have been tremors one.

B003LXSY60|5.0|The black keys are one of the greatest bands to come of late, their unique sound and awesome display of music ability is what makes them enjoyable to listen too. A great album, matter fact any of there albums are a must have.
0525953728|5.0|I initially purchased this for my husband after he asked me to obtain a copy. Within days I was  reading  it ,cover to cover, only sleeping in between. This is a amazing story and is written very well. You accually start to feel you are right there with him. A true American hero!!
B007TK77QE|4.0|The Casual Vacancy is definitely something different from JK Rowling's Harry Potter series. The reader is best to leave any preconceived ideas that the book will be somewhat similar. The Casual Vacancy is an interesting story about the residents of the fictional town of Pagford.<br /><br />Rowling is able to express the feelings, ideas, torments, and fears of the different residents of the town -- both adults and young people. I found the book very interesting and I enjoyed reading it as it was a refreshing change from most of the other books coming out lately.
0316228532|5.0|Because my mother was a huge Anglophile and I have seen a ton of British comedy films, I understood this genre and fell right into the world of this tiny town with its tiny-minded inhabitants. Pagford is the center (centre) of their existence, and everyone knows everyone else's business. But, once the doors are closed, families are hiding secrets that are crippling. Children are abused, mental illness rules, dissatisfaction and sadness. Small meanness keeps some hearts forever closed.<br /><br />Add to this, the fear we in the US see when we talk about poor people, drug abuse, welfare concerns. As a deeply-involved character study, this book looks at politics and the lengths people will go to avoid having to let go of preconceived notions of others.<br /><br />The Council of Pagford is gearing up for an ugly battle over The Fields -- a neighborhood that is legally a part of Pagford, a neighborhood of poor people with few prospects and few champions on the Council -- especially since Barry Fairbrother, a Fields success story, dies in the first scene. Barry is one of those stories 'reformers' love to tell...he grew up without much hope, but he fought for opportunities and he made something out of himself. His mission in life, before his unfortunate death, was to give a hand-up for others in the Fields, to show others they can do it too. This is not a welcome message for Howard, Barry's principal rival on the Council. He wants to shut down services to the people in the Fields and cut them loose from any support.<br /><br />With Barry's death, an opening in the Council becomes the prize for pro-and anti-Fields townspeople. We see the machinations behind the scenes and men in Pagford begin considering their own run.<br /><br />One of the criticisms of the book is the fact there are so many characters. I found it hard at first to keep track, so I made a chart to refer back to. This is one of those elements that reminded me of the old films Mom and I watched...SEEING the actors would be much easier than reading the names. If there was a character Rowling should have cut, I'd love for someone to give me that name. Every one added authenticity to this town. Every one contributed to the shattering climax.<br /><br />I found myself drawn to the young people...friends and classmates in the school the Pagford community wants to keep 'pure', code for 'free of Fields' kids.'<br /><br />Simon decides to run...but will his horrendous abuse, temper, and illegal dealings come out? His son Andrew hopes so.<br /><br />Colin decides to run...the assistant headmaster of the school...but his wife seems to brood on a secret she fears will come to light. Their son \\"Fats\\" is a walking time bomb, aimed in his parents' direction.<br /><br />Miles, Howard's son, has the inside track and seems to be blithering toward the office.<br /><br />Gumming up the works for everyone is Krystal Weedon. Krystal is a posterchild for what's wrong with the Fields: addict mother who turns tricks, anger issues, mouth of a sailor. She's also a shining example of a Fields child who can be saved: a good heart, devotion to her little brother and great-grandmother, smarts, and athletic ability.<br /><br />We see the pettiness of prejudiced people...their fear of people who are difference, their meanness, their back-stabbing. Their inability to see from someone else's point of view. Their eagerness to throw away people who are different.<br /><br />The Fields are inhabited by the 47%. People who ARE struggling, people who have (some of them) given up. Rowling does a masterful job of showing how hard it is to nurture hope when the world seems to be against you. Exactly how often is a person supposed to get back up when the world beats you down, and there's no one with a helping hand? But she shows us there is much worth saving...if the policymakers will have the Christian courage to love their neighbors. I found the parallels to our own country uncomfortably compelling.<br /><br />I was fascinated by her young people and their internal struggles...every one, despite the home he or she might live in, lives an internal life of fear and pain, of anger and revenge. They learn revenge hurts everyone, but I have the most hope for the teens. I fear for their parents...I'm not sure much has been learned.<br /><br />The community's indifference and self-centeredness contribute to the ultimate tragedy.<br /><br />I loved this book...the complicated characters, every one a full-drawn, rounded character, the relationships, the DALLOWAY-like crossing of the characters as she draws us from one scene into another. The glimpse into British politics. The lesson that humans are more alike than we're different.<br /><br />flag>I was fascinated by her young people and their internal struggles...every one, despite the home he or she might live in, lives an internal life of fear and pain, of anger and revenge.

B000JMKTLO|4.0|Flynn writes characters like no one you've ever met, yet somehow are very relatable. A really gripping read about the kind of darkness that can live within someone you think you know. Really disturbing.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The beginning of the book was a little confusing, especially the chapters about the timekeeper. I didn't know how the 3 separate chracters related to each other.  That all came together towards the end, of course.  It was all redeemed when the 3 characters intertwined and it concluded with a good \\"moral to the story\\". The key to reading the beginning is \\"have patience\\"...the book is well worth it.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|I liked this book.  Although there is nothing really new here, the author presents the material in a thoughtful and creative way.  After reading it, I have found that there are many aspects of my own \\"habits\\" that stand out as good examples of the author's premise.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|As the title to this review plainly says, this is one of my favorite movies. I might be biased, since I liked Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving before seeing the film. The film is super-hero thriller that builds until its explosive ending. Despite the sometimes depressive story-line and bleak undertone, which is purposeful, the story has a great plot and ending full of redemption. It keeps you guessing, and leaves you on the edge of your seat. By the way, this purchase is a few years old, so since this purchase, I've invested in a Play Station 3. I enjoyed this movie so much, that I bought it again in Blu-Ray. An excellent film, at a great price. You should buy it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT. I WISH EVERY FAMILY IN AMERICAN WOULD WATCH IT, IF THERE ARE CHILDREN IN THE FAMILY.<br />IT IS A GREAT PREPARER FOR A FATHER TO BE AS WELL.<br />CHILDREN NEED SPECIAL ATTENTION WHEN GROWING UP AND THIS MOVIES SET GOOD EXAMPLES JUST HOW THAT SHOULD BE DONE.<br /><br />THANKS - KATHY WILLIAMS
1401235417|5.0|I collected this series in single issues so I don't know about the extra stuff the trade has, but I do know the actual story and it's amazing. I don't know what else I could say that hasn't already been said. This is the best of the new 52, not because it's Batman, it's because Snyder and Capullo are an incredible comic making force.
0316228532|5.0|I can't quite understand all critics' and Amazon readers' bad reviews. This is the best novel I've read in a long time. I'm not sure if it's deliberate, but it has echoes of \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" One man's death causes the unraveling of a community. Yes, it's a pretty grim story, but Rowling's biting social commentary is entertaining. Each character is deeply flawed but in a very human and recognizable way.<br /><br />Clear your mind of HP and if you're up for a somewhat more challenging read than usual, give it a try.
B008RTE09S|5.0|This newly restored Blu-ray edition of Magical Mystery Tour is still the great curio of entertaining visuals and sound that I always considered it to be.Though it was initially reviewed as unintelligible and indulgent,this film was way ahead of its time.Felliniesque,Monty Pythonesque,this film defies categorization.In a mere 53 minutes,the film is an off the cuff storyline in a bare-bones format featuring the Fab Four leading us along the British countryside with an odd assortment of characters like Ringo's Aunt Jessie(Jessie Robbins)and Mr.Bloodvessel(Ivor Cutler),that sometimes tests the viewer's patience but ultimately yields a well-balanced product of humor and psychedelia buoyed by 6 new songs with special kudos to \\"I Am The Walrus\\".Other than the performance of this song,the strongest visual for me is John serving Aunt Jessie a mountain of spaghetti with a shovel in a dream and Neil Innes' Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band's performance of \\"Death Cab For Cutie\\".There's some slight color fading but it's still a marked improvement over previous editions.The lossless sound offers crisp clarity and fidelity one would expect from the Beatles.As one of the final images of the film reaches its finality:the Fabs ascending the staircase in \\"Your Mother Should Know\\",the realization is there--a film,a group that defied definition but was yet,very mythic.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Having not read any of the Harry Potter books, I was very excited about reading an adult book by this author. I am having a really hard time getting through this book! Because of the popularity of the Harry Potter books, maybe I expected too much or maybe it's just me. I love to read and usually can't wait to get back into whatever book I am reading, but I may have to pass on this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can't put this book down. I love it and I'm ready for the next one. I love everything about this book.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was really sceptical when I started reading the series but every book has gotten better. I would reccomend them to any adult who loves a romantic story line.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I wasn't sure how to feel about this book at the beginning.  It is SO different from the Harry Potter books.  I thought it got off to a slow start, with the introduction of lots of characters and the mingling of all these characters in a small town, but the pace picks up & the ending is unexpected.  Once the reader gets a feel for each character, the book becomes an enjoyable read. I recommend it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is super awesome  and very addictive. It also needs a lot of brains. Helps you think a lot faster as well as everything else I said.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first two books were outstanding, when it comes to this i would have to say I'm undecided how i feel. there was something i totally disagree with, than were times i couldn't put my kindle down. would I recommend  it. I would have to say yes just don't get your hopes up for it to be outstanding like the first two.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|i throughly enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the next in the series. highly recommend it to anyone  who enjoys stories with a mix of mystery,murder and mayhem (with a bit of romance thrown in).
B001NFNFNU|5.0|The service from you guys is the greatest and delivery was really fast. No complaints what so ever on your service. The movie Changeling was one of Angelina Jolie best performances, Ms Jolie has always been one of my favorite actors. The story line was true to the time period. The bigger cities were not like they are now, I'm sure there was corrupt Police in that time, mostly they wanted to put a feather in their hat so they could go on to bigger and better things. (Politics) was the name of the game for advancement in one's career as public servants in government, just as it is now. The character Ms. Jolie partrade seemed to be true of woman of that time. They were taken advantage of in so many ways. What ever they were to told by men was what they usually did, but with exception the mother of the missing child kept pressure on the public officials until the case was solved and the mother's child was safely back home and the criminal was arrested.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Very interesting choices, not on my list for love making, altho I don't remember having music in the bedroom.<br /><br />Loaned cd to a friend - she enjoyed it as well.
B007V65R54|5.0|This book should be required reading for politicians, voters, students, teachers, everyone.<br /><br />It's a short course in how to understand science, statistics, ourselves, and the world.<br /><br />He covers topics from sports, poker, the economy, the stock market, terrorism, to global warming.  Indeed, his discussion of global warming is the simplest, most straight-forward explanation of the issue and the controversy that I've ever seen.  (I had believed that I understood the issue... after reading this book I realize that I was mistaken, but I understand it better now.)<br /><br />The writing style is pleasant, almost conversational, and very easy to read.  He makes a subject that seems on its face like it might be sort of dry, into a compelling, captivating text.  I can't think of enough superlatives.<br /><br />I can't imagine how anyone could dislike this book... unless you're one of the lousy forecasters he skewers.
B009329ZF2|1.0|I'm under the impression that this movie was made for (and perhaps by) pre-adolescent boys. It reminds me of watching my nephews with their military toys. BOOM! Destroyers spinning mid-air... on fire... while the invincible battleship plays superman with its hidden anti-physics engine. Really, it's simple: If you like to watch things explode... this is the movie for you. If, on the other hand, you appreciate a well-written plot, clever dialogue, and quality acting... don't waste your money on this one. It's really that straight forward, folks.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This was an uplifting and interesting journey with some unexpected turns in the road. Would recommend this book to everyone who wants to feel good about the human race.
B009G3T01M|5.0|I listened to this album a million times on Spotify before I realized I really wanted to give $10 to Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. This album is beautiful, inspirational, makes you want to dance, and makes you want to hug yourself. Check out this explanation of the lyrics of Ten Thousand Hours (rapgenius.com/Macklemore-ten-thousand-hours-lyrics). I've never heard a better rap song memorializing the rap artist's intent to rise to stardom. I'm no pro--I'm just a typical top 40 listener, but this is awesome. Highly recommended.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Not much substance to the book but i picked up a few neat little idioms of time. so i have a few more ante dotes of wisdom to share
B001TW68P4|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST COMPILATION OF THE BEST SONGS THE TURTLES RECORDED. IT IS A GREAT BEST OF HITS CD.
1449410243|3.0|See it was not what I expected like the last book he had(5 very good reasons to punch a dolphin in the mouth). The last book had so many DIFFERENT comics about DIFFERENT things. Also this book was way to short. Finally, all this book focused on were cats. I thought it would have cats and other types of comics not just cats.<br />Hope next book is better.

B007THA4FI|1.0|Very disappointing read. I understand expectations were high, however this story didn't even come close. I felt like I was reading a dictionary, too much discriptive writing, not enough dialogue. My 12 year old could have thought up a better story and written a better plot. I blame the publisher, it looks like someone wanted to make a quick buck on a big name. Suggestion for book - use as fire starter.
0316228532|3.0|J. K. Rowling is one of the most successful writers of all time due to her Harry Potter franchise becoming a worldwide phenomenon. I was a bit surprised when she announced that she was writing an adult book instead of another children fantasy series. The moment she made the announcement the pressure for success was on her.<br /><br />Every fan, every reader, and every critic are expecting another Harry Potter, but in reality what we get is a small town drama with a bit of dark humor mixed in. The book is getting mixed to negative reviews from critics and fans because of the sudden change in genre. J. K. Rowling warned everyone that she was writing a different kind of book.<br /><br />Why is everyone so disappointed?<br /><br />Let me tell you the plot of The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />The book opens on a Sunday evening in the small English town of Pagford where Barry Fairbrother drops dead! His wife, kids, and friends are mourning his death, but not everybody cared for him. You see Barry was on the town council and now because of his death there is a casual vacancy. In other words, his spot on the council is open and there are citizens that would die to fill it. In Barry's control, prior to his death, was the rough part of town known as \\"The Fields\\" and the lease to the local drug clinic, which are both now up for grabs. The three men interested in the seat are Cubby Wall (Barry's friend and deputy headmaster of the school) Simon Price (He's a hateful man, especially toward his teenage son, Andrew), and Miles Mollison.<br /><br />After reading several reviews, I saw that readers were comparing this book to the Harry Potter series, which is completely unfair in my opinion. You can't compare a children's book to an adult book. It's like comparing Judy Blume's Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing to her adult book Wifey. The two books have nothing in common except for the fact that they are written by the same author. I started reading The Causal Vacancy as is, keeping Harry Potter far from my mind.<br /><br />How did I like it?<br /><br />That's a tough question, because it took me forever to finish reading it. J.K. Rowing is one of the greatest authors of our generation. She is a skillful writer. I would even compare her writing style to Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. The Causal Vacancy is filled unlikable and flawed characters. The only character that I even liked was the teenager Krystal Weedon, who is a drug user, swears like a sailor, and will throw a punch at anyone that ticks her off. Her mother is pathetic excuse for a human being as she is heavy into drugs and is neglecting Krystal and her little brother, Robbie.<br /><br />The Causal Vacancy is a dark twisted satire of our society and how people will do anything to get what they want.<br /><br />Will there be a sequel?<br /><br />Considering the negative reviews, I highly doubt it, but the ending leaves it opens for future installments.<br /><br />After reading the book I'm left with a sour taste in my mouth. Yes, it is beautifully written, but it is quite boring with way too many characters, actually there is not even a main character which is part of the book's problem. I respect the author decision to write something completely different than anyone would expect. The Casual Vacancy will never be considered a classic and it will probably never be adapted to film or television. The book is not for everyone. Your have to read it with an open mind. In the end, I neither liked nor hated the book.y Potter far from my mind.<br /><br />How did I like it?<br /><br />That's a tough question, because it took me forever to finish reading it. J.K.

0525423656|3.0|I enjoyed this book, although I'm not really sure it lived up to my expectations. I liked that it was written from both Ky and Cassia's perspectives, and I liked that Ky would find something out before Cassia and then she would make some mistake or decision based on wrong information. I still feel that Cassia is only trying to be with Ky because he's an Aberration. Although I'm sure they're supposed to be \\"really in love,\\" I don't really think that Condie did a great job showing that. To me, their love is shallow and has no real reason. Except that it's difficult.<br /><br />I feel like Cassia and Xander should be together, and it kills me how much Cassia hurts him every single time he tries to help her. Oh, and the fact that he's a part of the Resistance that Ky doesn't want to join and nobody tells Cassia because Ky is afraid he'll lose her to him. If she really loved Ky, that wouldn't make that much of a difference. I'm hoping that Xander and Cassia end up together at the end of the third book, but I really don't see that happening. Not with two books about Cassia and Ky. Unless, of course, Ky dies. I'm not saying that I want that to happen, but I can't think of any other way Cassia would choose Xander over Ky.<br /><br />Back to Crossed though, I feel like this novel was a bit of a let down over all of the hype about how it was supposed to be SO EPIC and how Matched was only a set-up for HOW EPIC Crossed would be. I feel like Crossed is just another set-up, and I'm hoping the trilogy ends with a crazy epic finale. Not just running across the wilderness or whining about how you accidentally (or maybe purposely) got matched twice and don't know what to do.<br /><br />I also felt like a lot of the characters were underdeveloped. Indie had so much potential, but didn't really turn into much. Ky was fairly stagnant, except we learned a little bit about his past. And Cassia was just all over the place. The other characters were mostly forgettable, and had very little depth (if any). Maybe I need to go read Matched again, but I don't feel like this book was anywhere near as good.<br /><br />I'm not saying I hated the book - I definitely enjoyed it for the most part and am excited for the final part of the trilogy. It just wasn't up to par with a lot of the other books I've been reading lately, and I was definitely a little disappointed. I would give it a 3/5 though, and would probably still recommend the series to most people.depth (if any).

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I gave this to my ten year old son to try out.  He now says it's his favorite Nerf gun, and can we get more clips and darts for it, please?<br /><br />The gun looks big in the pictures, but it's smaller in real life.  Probably just about right for a 10 year old... he thinks its a big, powerful machine, but it is not too heavy or bulky for him.<br /><br />The assembly is pretty easy.  I just handed the box to my son, and he assembled it almost by himself.  There is one step where the plastic pieces need to lock together that he couldn't quite get.  We puzzled it out together, though.<br /><br />Once assembled, we could see this gun is aptly named.  Rapid-fire darts blasting one after the other!  Woo-hoo!  It would've been even more impressive if it came with a full complement of ammunition.  With a full load, it's really going to rock.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am trying to read \\"Casual Vacancy. There are so very many people to remember in this book.<br />The entire village is being introduced. I hope the story progresses to include more than the<br />introductions of the characters. The names of the villagers are unusual to me as an American.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the \\"Harry Potter\\" stories. I will finish \\"Casual Vacancy\\" hoping that my<br />mind can retain the connection of all the characters.<br /><br />I could have picked up any newspaper and read a story of this nature. I did not enjoy<br />reading \\"Casual Vacancy\\"<br /><br />Dayle Foreman
B009NPKTN6|1.0|I didn't make it 10 minutes and I had to stop. Pure agony. You have been warned. SERIOUSLY - if you like torture - then this is for you.
0340822775|3.0|Nice book, but I received it with no front cover. Being a collecter of hardcover books it's important to me to have the front cover. The details list no jacket, I assumed it was the protective clear plastic.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Very easily my favorite TV show -- possibly all-time.  Why?  It's oh, so much fun to watch.  And re-watch.  And that says a lot right there, that you can re-watch it and still love it.  Why?  The chemistry all throughout the cast is great.  But the interplay between Castle and Beckett is inspired.  Only a little less so is the relationship between Castle and his daughter Alexis (try NOT loving Molly Quinn -- you can't do it!).  Another big point in it's favor is that it's clear they are trying to make it fun.  There are no obvious \\"Emmy grabs\\" with deep and dark, gritty stories.  Just an entertaining hour of TV.  Start with a twisted murder scene, throw in some twists and plenty of banter, and sit back and smile.<br /><br />Time to pick up another season......
B007THA4FI|4.0|Pre-ordered the book with great expectation. It is a good novel but not the quality of storytelling I expected from J.K. Rowling.
0345803485|5.0|Very good book. Anyone who wants to read this just better be aware of the very adult theme & have an open mind. I'm going for the 2nd soon.
B007THA4FI|2.0|J.K. Rowling is a excellent writer, however this book was disappointing.  I never got involved in the story because most to the story was not interesting.<br />Most of the characters were pathetic who failed to elicit any compassion from<br />me. The story did not flow but just bumped along.  Very disappointing
B005FISBTO|4.0|I am a big fan of Dexter and have to wait until August to view Dexter each year as I live overseas. - In SHOWTIME'S opening montage, APPEARING AT THE START OF EVERY SEASON 6 DEXTER DISC, - Showtime reveals the cliffhanger scene for Season 6!!!!!!!!! - Do not Watch it!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Overall, a decent Dexter Season, but nothing can top Season 4!
B0033807E0|4.0|SPOILERS IN REVIEW<br /><br />First, this is an awesome book but I have got a few questions for Rick Riordan.<br /><br />Concerning Anteas<br />Somethings wrong with this guy. Apparently his dad is Poseidon and his mom is Gaia. SO WHY DID POSEIDON HAVE A KID WITH HIS GRANDMOTHER!? Why isn't Anteas a minor god or god or titan or something? Both his parents were.<br /><br />Luke/Kronos<br />Luke is in the gold sarcophagus. But he clearly wasn't in the sea of monsters. so what was in it at that point? How come Kronos, the dark lord of time, is momentarily defeated by a hairbrush?<br /><br />Percy<br /> He was gone for two weeks. When he gets back, annabeth is still allowed to assemble all the campers so she can talk about Percy. Did it work like this for Thalia's tree business? Plus, why does the quest resume immediately after this.<br /><br />These questions have only occurred to me through various re-reads, so i still highly reccomend this book ;)
B005LAIHCM|3.0|Ten minutes into the film, you have the thing figured out. Sarah (Elisabeth Shue) and her daughter Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) move into a nice home which they got a good deal on because the neighboring house had a double homicide. The daughter killed both her parents. They never found the daughter, but the son who was away at the time now lives in the home. At this point I lead a collective groan in the movie theater.<br /><br />Perennial teen Jennifer Lawrence, who apparently got hungry in between \\"Hunger Games\\" consented to play the ever helpful high school teen rock band singer. Mom works at a hospital and is over protective of Jennifer's movie virginity. This was a fair \\"B\\" movie mystery thriller.<br /><br />The script was good, but wasn't that great. Having someone the caliber of Jennifer Lawrence star in it, didn't add anything to the feature other than a box office attraction. Her fans will surely overrate this film. Let's not kid ourselves it is 3 1/2 stars even with Miss Lawrence. Predictable with a good head fake.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some immature teen swearing.
B002R68U7K|5.0|The deluxe version of The Singles Collection is totes better than the standard mainly because it just doesn't include only 17 of her singles, it includes each and every one up to her Circus album and a new one called \\"3\\". The singles also includes its B-sides, which are either unreleased tracks or dance remixes. There is also a booklet that features information on every single included (except for \\"3\\") and a DVD that features every single on of her music videos from 1998-2009 (except for \\"3\\"). Totally awesome.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Well thanks Mike for blowing the plot for anyone waiting to see the movie on dvd. Personally, I liked this one as much or maybe better than the first. Put all my favorites in one big movie and I am good to go. This 73 year old granny is a big fan of action movies. I can watch the mushy stuff when I get old.
B00005NUZO|4.0|Michael Jackson's Bad is my second favorite album (the first being Thriller) and this album doesn't disappoint especially with tracks like \\"Bad\\", \\"Dirty Diana\\", \\"Man in the Mirror\\" and \\"Smooth Criminal\\".
B000W7JWUA|4.0|The game itself is great.  We have a lot of fun playing this game.  However, the board is poorly made and feels almost like cardboard or lesser quality.  We played it once and on the second time taking it out to play the board and tiles were warped.  A friend had a previous version with better quality tiles made of thicker material.  I would prefer this older game set than the newer one that we have.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Thriller is one of my favorite MJ albums. It's great. My favorite songs would have to be \\"Thriller\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\", \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\". I wish Michael Jackson was still alive so I could see him live. Oh well and least we still have his music.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I love this carry case. I've always had problems of keeping my ear pieces from getting broken but this case is excellent.  Fits my ear piece to a T!  I highly recommend this earpiece as well as this carry case!

B007THA4FI|3.0|Most Harry Potter fans will not like this book, not that anyone should compare Rowling's new book to the Potter series. But I didn't expect this book to be so bleak. The Casual Vacancy is set in a small British town that's populated by small minded, selfish people with dysfunctional families and failing relationships.  Yes, Rowling created a world with strong characterizations, but I have a hard time with books if I don't like any of the characters, and that was the case with her first adult novel. The most likeable character died in the first chapter.  The characters who have some humanity are enablers with flawed relationships. Only at the end of the book do the other characters start showing each other some compassion, finally making an effort to patch up their families.  It's a sad book.  But I will probably read Rowling's next book in hopes that it's more uplifting.  [[ASIN:B007THA4FI The Casual Vacancy]]

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is a lot of fun. the only thing is, I cant figure out how to stop and start over!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Dont upgrade!!!  I just did and now I get commercials  for games and products.  Got hit with three before I could even get the game going.  I understand that the developers need to eat,  But that's. just to much.  If I cant get the upgrade to uninstall I will be uninstalling.
B0098VXE50|4.0|The movie was okay, but it did not hold my total attention.  There was too much hype about this movie.  I have to watch it again with full attention to it.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Incredible effects, great acting/cast, and even better plot. For the haters out there, please review other haters posts. You all have the same problem, the questions dont make any sense to you. Nor should they. This film is deeply intellectual but in your face simple when it needs to be. Like many epic films, not everything can be answered and some things are better off left alone (or in a sequel/prequel :) ). Great movie, highly recommend. Keep an open mind, and do not limit yourself to 2012 reality. We have come a long way since Alien. That is far more unrealistic than this film.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|First I would say that this Amazon Basic phone cover is worth $5.99. I needed a new cover for my iPhone 4 and didn't want to spend $30+ on a new once since I will be upgrading to an iPhone 5 soon. It gets the job done but let's not get too warm and fuzzy about this basic cover. As the name implies it is very basic with no covers for the hold/volume buttons, headphone jack, power button, or charging/dock connector. Periodic removal and cleaning with compressed air will be required. While it is a softer rubbery type case it is not non-slip. It is in fact slippery and I will probably end up dropping the phone because of it. We'll have to wait and see how it protects in the event of a drop. Also, as indicated in the instructions, there was no squeegee included for the screen protector. I destroyed the screen protector trying to get the bubbles out and ended up taking it to Verizon to have them apply a new screen protector. I don't use headphones but the jack for the ones included with the phone fit fine using this case.<br /><br />On the plus side the clear cover looks cool on my black Verizon iPhone 4 and it fits perfectly. As other reviewers have stated I like that the cover wraps around the front edges of the phone to protect and prevent the screen protector from coming off. I will do more research for my iPhone 5 cover but for now this is worth the price for my soon to be retired/handed down iPhone 4.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|i really like this little app.  I use it to keep all my gaming and story ideas separated.  Its great for those types of notes.  Not sure I would use it for anything longer than notes though.  Pretty much use this app to replace anything you would have used a notebook to jot down and its perfect.  the only downside ive found so far that keeps it from being perfect is when you name your notebook for what it contains it only has a small amount of a longer title displayed, so something like  Blank Ideas  just displays as Blank when you look at the multiple notebooks.
B006VA3ZT6|4.0|I really enjoy costume dramas, so this one fit the bill. Set in the English countryside it dispels the notion that all such households were cruel to the downstairs staff.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think it is a fun game that helps me know where to slide the coin during s fair or carnivores thanks for the consideration
B003VANOFY|4.0|Bought these looking for something that would allow me to move around and listen to games and movies on my computer without blasting the sound to the point where everyone could hear it.  Overall they're a great set of headphones.  They're certainly comfortable.  Lightweight enough to move around and they let you breath while still doing a good job of isolating the sound so outside noise doesn't bleed through.<br /><br />The buttons are also a cool feature and are readily compatible with Itunes in that you can play/pause as well as move forward and back.  The volume knob on the side is also a key feature allowing you to readily adjust the volume on your computer, my only problem with it is you have to turn it a few times to get all the way down or up.<br /><br />They have impressive range as well.  I can go a room or two away or head upstairs and still receive a clear signal.<br /><br />The sound is also very clear especially in the high and mid range.  The low range is also good but sometimes it can feel a bit lacking at times which in and of itself is good for games and movies but a little lackluster for listening to music.  Overall volume can also feel a bit limited at times in that you find yourself turning up the knob to get a little more power only to find out you're at max volume.  Still good volume just wish it could be a little better.  Surround sound is good.  Easier to locate the direction of sounds on games when compared to stereo headphones and speakers.<br /><br />For some reason USB has to be removed to use other speakers again as it turns off all other speakers and headphones when plugged in.  There might be a way  Battery life is solid, so far only had it die on me once in a two months.<br /><br />Overall though quality set of wireless headphones especially for the price point.  Logitech continues to produce very good values at affordable price points but never seem to get above a B+ in quality when price is factored out.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Claire Dannes is great at playing a psychotic CIA agent. Some times hard to believe but always beautiful. The cinematography is especially good with great camera angles.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|You cant put it down! It's funny, intense, frustrating, and exciting all at the same time! The characters are well developed and you can feel the passion!
B0053O89JM|5.0|This DVD set of season eight of house was great including all episodes plus extra behind the scenes. I bought it new and it was sent with out a scratch. I ordered it at a fraction of the cost of department retail price. and was shipped  very quickly I was very pleased with this last season of House. It is really too bad there won't be any more House.  It is a great ending to a great series.  If you are a fan you must get it.

B00555X8OA|5.0|Daniel Kahneman's is a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics.  How did he manage that? He was instrumental in debunking the traditional econ model of humans acting as perfectly rational agents. This book discusses his life's work: researching how human brains predictably and repeatedly make illogical decisions.  If you want to improve your own decision making, this is a great book to read.  It is well written and very accessible to a lay audience.

B00BLGXL3U|1.0|My partner and I wasted over two hours of our lives (it felt like about five), watching this beautiful looking, but in my opinion empty and pretentious nonsense. She took the easy way out and went to sleep after it became clear to her it was going to be a clunker. I unfortunately soldiered onward, convinced that something this polished, with such a talented and fully engaged cast, was eventually going to fill the cavernous void of its barely perceptible storyline with a rich feast of creative payoff and purpose. Instead, it came to a sputtering (but merciful) ending that lent little to its excessive and relentless running time. How on earth so many talented, professional critics were duped into thinking this represents good film making is a mystery. Many components are excellent, but it has no heart with which to give them life. This was the most disappointing film I have seen at the theater in several years.<br /><br />We love quirky, art-house films. We are both huge fans of Philip Seymour Hoffman's professional work, not to mention Amy Adams. Joaquin Phoenix does a remarkable job as well. . .yet none of the characters, despite the fine acting, felt well developed. Even with the mountain of emotional effort infused into the mechanics of the on-screen performances, I left feeling like I knew little more about the characters - despite this plodding leviathan's runtime - than I did when the movie began. Instead, I thought it felt self-indulgent and hollow.<br /><br />Clearly this was made by a lot of talented people including a director whose previous work I enjoy. . .but what ended up on the screen here plays like a meaningless collision of cast and crew, slowed down to such a glacial pace that by the end you just want the crash to be over and the tow trucks to haul the leftover wreckage away.<br /><br />What a mess.
B008Q00MRC|5.0|People think of trolls as the little things you put on pencils in the 70's (which are now worth up to hundreds of dollars). Take a minute to read the directors story. It explains much of the Norwegian childhood storybooks that guided this film. The paintings of trolls done in the early 1900s look just like the ones in this movie.
B006AX6ONI|2.0|I have not read the ebook but I have read some of his blogs which form the basis for this ego-driven autobiography, and my 28-year career was with a trade association of 4,000 CEOs like him. Before that I worked for several bosses like him, so I am qualified to comment. I obtained a degree in business management after my engineering education and it caused me to realize I am not one of them, so I cannot do what he did as he claims. Neither can most other readers so I think it would be better titled,\\"How I Won....\\" One of my mentors said to be a successful business owner and CEO you must be willing and able to make ruthless decisions...and I am not. But it does seem that is what it takes for this kind of success in American capitalism. It also helps if you can party 24/7 with the right people.<br /><br />So, if you think you have what it takes, perhaps his story may be useful to you. But, I can sleep comfortably knowing there is no string of human disasters in my history because of ruthless decisions I have made - family life included. I wonder if he can say the same thing. I cannot help but think of Jack Welch of GE infamy in the same manner as well as all the infamous leaders thoughout history of American business. Such people use money to keep score and they hate to lose. He talks of making win-win deals, but they enjoy winning far more than losing - hence owning a team of gladiators to extend his ego even further. The late football coach, Vince Lombardy said winning is not everything, it is the only thing and if not why do they keep score. Employees merely are a necessary factor of pursuing business to be obtained at lowest cost. Look deeply and you will find the same motivation in the Roman coliseum. But, guys like him seldom admit that many others had to be sacrificed to achieve their wealth. Moreover, there is the gift of imagination they seem to have which enables them to see opportunities to make money where others do not. Thankfully, I have a defined benefit pension which is almost impossible for workers today. I bet his companies do not provide that kind of security for his employees. Had it not been for organized labor, I probably would be like most who lost their 401K money in the crash of 2009. So, to Mr. Cuban I say sleep well. But remember, without others who were sacrified along the way, you would not be in the top one percent. It must all be the will of God - generator, operator, destroyer - or it would be different. Google Theofatalism to learn who really controls everything.[...]
0061438294|5.0|I have read several body language books and most of them are either logical or just too obvious. But Joe Navarro has implemented a very descriptive piece of work, and beautifully presented. I am a student in 10th grade and I've already witness several nonverbal techniques they use. It is by far one of the most accurate body language books I have ever read. This book IS recommended for anyone who has troubles in decoding nonverbal language or just general interest.

The visual design is quite appealing and this app is handy to have so it can be easily pulled up if needed.<br /><br />It also has these nice features:<br />The calculations you enter are displayed on the screen so you can verify these.<br />It has a memory feature that enables you to keep running totals.<br />If you make a mistake you can use the Backspace key instead of the Clear key so there is no need to retype everything.<br /><br />There are small unobtrusive ads at the top but these cause no distraction and can be easily ignored.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love love love love love this app..cures my boredom every single time! Gives me lots of creative crafts, ideas, quotes and recipes.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|The philosophical/psychological themes of this movie, if fleshed out more, could have made it very interesting to me... had not it been so painfully stupid in so many ways. First and foremost, I'm sure I will not be alone in pointing out that real wolves do not look like gigantic evil drooling versions of toy stuffed animals moved jerkily by the hands of a 3-year-old kid. Good gosh, I read it cost $25,000,000 to make this movie... where did the money go? The behavior of the humans was inexplicably dumb as well: Surrounded and chased by a probing pack of satanic wolf puppets, nobody even bothers to carry a club or sharpened stick with them. Injured men are left to lag behind without aid, concern, or watchfulness. Holy cow, even the laws of physics were broken left and right, as campfires composed of tiny sticks burn endlessly without refueling, a man dashing off a snow-covered cliff travels 50 yards horizontally while only dropping 10 feet vertically, and a guy who must be exhausted and starving to begin with shows no apparent signs of hypothermia after emerging into frigid air from a lengthy plunge into ice water. Oh, then there was the thundersnowstorm, something I have never ever witnessed in my entire life of living in the snow country of Upper Michigan. Too many people here are making excuses for this rubbish. This type of movie cannot succeed for me without some degree of realism; I was expecting an adventure, not a comic book written by idiots.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I loved reading this book. The book is a masterpiece. The author, in a mixture of highly inventive styles, uses diaries, travel logs, science fiction, mystery writing and more. The book shifts back and forth through hundreds of years and the characters are linked to each other in different ways. It will be interesting to see if the movie can capture the experimental and visionary quality of the book.
B008I3R2VG|5.0|I am in love with this album. It is arguably The Killers' best yet. I listened to it at least 6 times on iTunes before it was even released, and after owning it for less than a month, every song is well on its way to my \\"Top 25 Most Played\\" playlist. I would definitely recommend this album to EVERYONE. There is truly no other band like The Killers...at least not from this decade.
B000I55YU8|4.0|The movie was good but not five stars Fine performance by Michael Douglas but not his best Plot believable Japanese cops too strict NYPD detectives to tough and gun-ho Disc itself was perfect especially for the year of release Colors were crisp Sound was great even without surround sound It was worth getting

B008LSVLZG|5.0|So it happened, Steven Wilson's first solo tour. After he released his second solo album, the amazing Grace For Drowning, Steven finally decided to tour under his own name. It would make sense that during the tour Steven would perform many of his \\"hits\\" from his vast catalog of different projects including Porcupine Tree, No Man, Blackfield, and a few songs from his solo albums. That would have been an easy and risk free approach. However,Steven is no an individual who looks for the easy way out. He chose to perform songs exclusively from his solo albums Insurgentes and Grace For Drowning, as well as, cherry picked musicians of the highest level to perform the material. Furthermore, the surround sound equipment plus the expensive production, with the help of old friend and amazing artist Lasse Hoile, made the concert truly come to live. You were consumed by this atmosphere of mystery and magic as soon as you walked into the venue. All this was done in order to bring us a grandiose, complete, and conceptually complex show equivalent to if not better than those of Porcupine Tree.<br /><br />I attended the first leg of the Grace For Drowning tour. It was one of the best concerts that I ever saw. It had great music, theater like production, and wonderful musicianship, which made the show an unforgettable experience. Get All You Deserve was filmed during the second leg of the tour in Mexico. Apart from the usual features that can be seen on all of Steven Wilson's releases (e.g., great sound, stunning visuals, and beautiful music) this live DVD has one more unique quality. It was able to capture the chemistry between Steven Wilson and the band members (Marco Minnemann - drums, Nick Beggs - bass, Theo Travis - flute saxophone, Adam Holzman - keyboards and Nico Tsonev - guitar). It is evident that Wilson really enjoyed himself by allowing his band-mates to shine while assuming the role of the director of the show. I believe that he was inspired by the live shows of Frank Zappa, which he himself admits during interviews. I must admit that I have never seen him this happy and energized during a show. One more thing that is unique to this concert is that it features the yet unreleased song Luminol from the upcoming third album.<br /><br />In conclusion: if you were one of those lucky individuals who attended one of his shows from the Grace For Drowning tour this would be perfect little reminder of just how great and magical it was. And if you were unable to catch Steven live this release is essential for you!

B0028MBKVG|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me. He said it started him on his journey to change his life, so I added it to my wish list. It took me several months to finally get around to buying and reading it. I'm really glad I did!<br /><br />As an adult I've had my bouts of exercising and not. I've never been a fan of running. This book has changed all of that.<br /><br />While it isn't strictly a story of running, that is the main theme. However boring it sounds, it isn't boring at all. The book is a true story and is filled with the most colorful characters imaginable. I guess it's true that real life can be better than fiction! It definitely kept me coming back for more.<br /><br />It has also inspired me to take up running. The book reminded me of the pure joy I used to feel just breaking into a fast run across an open field. I am inspired to get back to that place of sheer happiness for the physicality of something basic. I didn't think that was possible.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anybody from fitness nut to fitness naysayer. It's a great read.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|My husband assembled it for me and we tried several times to score the wine bottle that was being used.  In the process the small discs that score the glass came loose and fell out.  After I reassembled the cutting mechanism, pushed them forward and tightened it down, I was able to score the glass.  I dipped the bottle in the boiling pan of water on the stove, dipped the bottle into the ice water bath and back into the boiling water and the top popped off! I need to pay attention to where I start to prevent re-scoring, I think that created an uneven cut in that small area of the bottle.

B007THA4FI|1.0|So many cuss words and not a sin left uncovered in the book.  Reaaly a slow read and too many characters to try and keep track of. I was really disappointed in this whole book.
B002KGKH5A|1.0|The dvd its self was awesome. Im a huge Stripes fan so of course I loved it. The case to the dvd was busted as if someone had droped it and it landed right on the bottom left corner. The plasic and the paper under the plastic was torn as well. I usually never have problems with Amazon. Even the used stuff I have bought from them in the past is almost in near perfect condition. Idk what happened this time?!

Fun and fast and a good game to pass the time while waiting for appointments. Might keep you awake if you play right before trying to sleep, though. Pleasantly addictive.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Kiss has always been one of the most creative bands when it comes to merchandising and giving the fans a real bang for their buck. Because I am a child of the 70's I bought the vinyl version of Monster and was surprised after slicing open the plastic wrap with my fingernail to find my 180 gram vinyl record enclosed in a plan white paper holder. I actually turned the album sleeve upside down and shook it to see if there was anything in it, other than the record-- and more on that in a moment.<br />Nothing, not even a Kiss Army postcard application!! Remember those? Okay, so Gene and Paul have gone minimalist. I read a review I found online about how bad the cover is-- I think the cover is alright, so really no complaints there. I am not sure why the band didn't do more with the vinyl version of Monster. I know the sticker says \\"No filler\\", so I guess I was forewarned.<br />On to the record:<br />I haven't heard the CD yet, but this vinyl version could have used more care. Why? It sounds way too compressed for a vinyl record. Example? Long Way Down, the last song on the first side. It's glaring. It doesn't sound like it was mixed right. This record is 40 minutes long. It needed to be two records playing at the 45 speed. I paid 24.99 at my local independent record store. I paid the same price for the latest Foo Fighters record in vinyl and it was two records and sounds fantastic.<br />So I am a big Kiss fan, love the band, will have to buy the CD, but am disappointed that the guys didn't put more care into the vinyl.<br />So how is the music. Love it. Only real filler is the last song on the second side, Last Chance, but then maybe it will grow on me.<br />I will give the music five stars but the vinyl version two. What bugs me is that I heard long way down previewed on Kissonline and thought it was great after only one listen. I may listen to the itunes version and see if it sounds better. Vinyl, though, should never sound worse than a digitally compressed music file.What's up?

B009NBSLIU|5.0|So far, this second season is showing as much promise as Season One held for me. I love this show!!! It is just as suspenseful and engaging as \\"Damages\\" was.<br /><br />\\"Mad Men\\" and \\"Magic City\\" are two more I am streaming and have subscribed to for entire seasons. What a relief from having to watch movies on N*E*T*F*L*I*X, which I have cancelled. TV may just be going back to good programming, speaking for myself, and I don't mind paying the price. 1.89 for each episode, once a week, if you buy the whole season, yet are charged only for each episode that has aired. Not too bad at all, because you OWN this and most of them are worth watching over twice. I get much more out of them, this way. Love Amazon for so many reasons.<br /><br />Get ready for glamor, suspense and mystery, and beautiful people, sets and clothes. WOW!!! We have some great writing and acting and directing, not to mention fantastic musical scores, that are going on these days. :)

B000654YRY|2.0|Mark Knopfler is unquestionably one of the greatest UK guitarists and songwriters of all time. Unfortunately, this concert, the second live album Dire Straits released and one of their last outings before they disbanded in 1995, is very disappointing and their weakest release, along with the studio album that accompanied it, 'On Every Street'.<br /><br />This album contains excerpts from one or two of the final concerts Dire Straits played in 1992. Instead of going for a double album (as they did with 'Alchemy') though, they decided to release a single disc/cassette, featuring only ten tracks.<br /><br />There is no questioning that the musicianship on this concert is first rate. The opinion of some people may be that this concert is more musically elaborate than 'Alchemy' and the concerts accompanying the hugely successful 'Brothers In Arms' tour from 1985-86. Unfortunately however, the raw sound that the band produced in those concerts that made them so uplifting and enjoyable is missing here. This is a much more laboured effort, and it clearly shows as nearly all of the songs on this release, even classics such as 'Private Investigations' 'Money for Nothing' are rendered impotent. The exception is 'Romeo and Juliet' which is superior to the 'Alchemy' version and probably the best song on here. Some of Dire Straits' most popular songs that they played during this tour including 'Sultans of Swing', 'Tunnel of Love', and 'Telegraph Road' have been omitted and instead a lacklustre version of 'You and Your Friend' made its way on to the album, which further weakens this set.<br /><br />The soloing on most of the tracks is excessive this time around and aside from 'Romeo and Juliet', this sadly makes 'On the Night' a genuine chore to listen to from beginning to end. Chris Whitten's drumming here is nowhere near as strong as Terry Williams, whose outstanding energetic contributions were always present from 1982 until he left the band in 1988.<br /><br />This album is anunworthy successor to 1983's 'Alchemy', which apart from a few weak moments is an excellent live concert which grows on the listener. Dire Straits should be remembered in their most classic years, 1982 to 1988. Their 1985-86 world tour was fantastic, as demonstrated by the superb July 10 1985 concert at Wembley Arena, which was televised on 'The Tube' in January 1986 but sadly never officially released on album or DVD. Their performance was at the Nelson Mandela concert in 1988 also came close, and was their last truly great concert (as well as their last concert with Terry Williams as drummer).<br /><br />With 'On The Night' Dire Straits sound tired and like a band nearing the end of their life. A disappointing, rather lacklustre release, which could have been a lot better. This is a shame as it ended up being Dire Straits' final world tour before they disbanded for good and Knopfler started his solo career.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|There are a lot of firsts in Mark Watney's life, first man alone on Mars, first man abandoned on Mars, first man to grow potatoes in his own excrement on Mars. Things can only look up right? With just 70's sitcoms and the horrors of Disco to accompany him he sets out to accomplish the impossible, to go home.....and to not ever eat another potato.<br /><br />I am always wary of reviews that are all consistently good but I do not think you will see a bad review of this book. If there is, it is because they hate Hard Science Fiction, or they are humourless or more probably both, I mean who does not like Hard Science Fiction right? This is the best 99c I have ever spent. You may be sceptical beforehand but 1 chapter will be enough to convince you this book is worth every cent. It is well written, well edited, funny, sad, gross and a great adventure from beginning to end.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|(Minor spoilers)<br />  The Dark Knight Rises is third and (supposed) final movie in The Dark Knight series. I will try to keep this movie review as spoiler free as I can. First, this is my favorite movie of the year but not just for reasons you may think. Yes, the action sequences have good build up and the tone of the movie show a more vulnerable Bruce Wayne/Batman.  The vulnerability of Batman is what has helped make him become on of the favorites.<br /><br />  If you truly look past some of the stuff on the surface (for instance Bane silly voice) you will find a message on manhood and helping others. This movie is more about Bruce Wayne as he struggles with his past decisions and defining himself. My favorite scene in the movie is where Bruce has to get out of a pit and keeps failing. In order for him to get out of the pit he has to confront his past and realize you cannot change the past. Instead the movie shows the best you can do is confront your fears and move forward.<br /><br />  The movie's villain Bane helps show the vulnerability of Batman and I understand why he was chosen for this film. He's imposing, stronger,faster, and more ruthless. Batman has never faced a foe such as him in the other films. But as the theme of the movie states \\"You don't have to wear a mask to a be a hero\\" and Batman is not alone.<br /><br />  Everyone gives a strong performance and are aided by a great soundtrack (though more subdued than The Dark Knight). Some others will eloquently point out things in story that could have flowed better which are valid points. The Dark Knight Rises themes make it worth checking out and as always Batman does what he does. That's be a BOSS. I highly recommend this movie even over The Avengers.
0767802470|5.0|An excellent movie that portrays life on the other side of the war! They had a very tough job and still they did their duty as seen from their side. Our own forces had it just as bad too, and they all still did what was required of them! Amazing!

0812992792|4.0|he Orphan Master's Son can be a frustrating, meandering read, but in the end it's definitely worth it.<br /><br />The titular son is Pak Jun Do, who bares the name of a North Korean hero like the orphans he grew up with. The story follows Jun Do's life in North Korea as he goes from loyal soldier and citizen to a free-thinking human being. The plot jumps around quite a bit, and is especially jarring in the beginning; over the course of only three pages Jun Do goes from child to tunnel soldier to kidnapper. It's a bit hard to root for Jun Do in the early chapters as well, given his role kidnapping innocent people from Japan and taking them to North Korea.<br /><br />To reiterate, however, the story is worth continuing as Jun Do becomes a better human being and even gets a taste of the outside world. It soon becomes apparent that the rapid shifts reflect how the people's lives are at the mercy and whims of the state. It's much easier to become attached to the protagonist as he finally takes control of his own life.<br /><br />The second half of the novel shifts to the interrogation of a previously mentioned character, Commander Ga, and shifts between Ga's flashbacks and the first-person perspective of his torturer. It's revealed that this \\"Commander Ga\\" is not the original, and that he may in fact be Pak Jun Do.<br /><br />It is always fascinating to read about North Korea, and interest in the secluded nation has certainly grown since the recent death of Kim Jong Il. There are horrifying depictions of torture and the infamous prison camps, as well as the lives of everyday people. Given the closed nature of North Korean society it is hard to know how much is based on true events, but the North Korea depicted in The Orphan Master's Son is certainly a believable one.<br /><br />A review copy was provided through Goodreads.com First Reads program.
B002L5EA4O|5.0|A great movie that keeps you engaged the whole time. You can't go wrong with Robert Redford anyway.  Good mystery, but funny sometimes as well.
0375703764|4.0|Johnny Truant receives a late night call from his friend, Lude. A strange old blind man in Lude's building, known only as Zampano, has died; the old man's apartment is a bizarre scene filled with tape measures and fragments of an even weirder manuscript. Johnny soon finds himself compelled to transcribe and edit the old man's work-a treatise on a film that does not appear to exist, and which is slowly driving Johnny mad...<br /><br />The bulk of the novel consists of \\"The Navidson Record,\\" Zampano's academic study on a purportedly famous documentary film that even Johnny admits may not exist. The film follows famed photographer Will Navidson, who seeks to record the experiences of his family's move to an old house in Virginia. The focus soon shifts, however, as Navidson discovers a small anomaly of the house-the inside is slightly bigger than the outside. Shortly afterward, the entrance a mysterious corridor appears in the living room, in what is seemingly an outside wall. The film soon shifts to the exploration of a possibly infinite space, filled with pitch-black walls, shifting corridors, and staircase that may be deeper than the earth itself.<br /><br />The faux-academic style can be a bit dry at times, as \\"Zampano\\" makes large digressions into the nature of labyrinths, mythology, and echoes. However, his admittedly \\"freshman\\" writing style contains plenty of dialogue and suspense, and the details of the house are wonderfully creepy. There are copious footnotes scattered throughout the text, many fictional, and a great deal bizarre in and of themselves.<br /><br />Johnny's story is largely told throughout these footnotes, as he often interrupts with humorous observations on \\"The Navidson Record\\" and its inconsistencies. Many of his notes are very stream-of-consciousness, and some of Johnny's tales of sex and drugs can be too much of a distraction at times. Most are well done however, especially the later footnotes that show his descent into madness.<br /><br />Danielewski plays with the text layout almost constantly; a notable chapter on labyrinths sends the reader into a literal maze of footnotes. When Navidson enters the black hallways of his house, the text shifts and changes along with the house itself. Some the textual oddities even extend as far as the cover and copyright page.<br /><br />Also included are a number of photographs, drawings, collages, and poems to accompany the story. The book is also riddled with codes and puzzles to solve if the reader wishes to dig deeper.<br /><br />Creepy, bizarre, and even funny at times, House and Leaves is a fantastic read. The book may be difficult at times, but the reward is an excellent, unique, and satisfying reading experience.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I would have given it 5, but there were a few chapters that were quite dark that could have been shorter in length. So I'll say 4.5. I did enjoy this book immensely, and learned a bit about fowers that I didn't already know.
B008EAVOEE|4.0|Le Cirque des Reves is a mysterious traveling carnival that arrives unannounced, and opens only at night. Ostensibly the brainchild of artist Chandresh Christophe Lefevre, the circus features seemingly endless tents filled with performers, rides, and indoor landscapes for patrons to explore. Many find the circus magical because it actually is; Le Cirque has secretly been chosen as venue for a private competition between two magicians, who have bound their students into a mysterious test of magical methods. One student, Celia, performs in plain sight as an illusionist, while her rival, Marco, works behind the scenes as Lefevre's assistant.<br /><br />The circus is definitely the star here, as Celia's and Marco's creations make it a wonderfully imaginative setting. There is a seemingly endless labyrinth of puzzle-like rooms, a towering maze of fluffy clouds, and even a menagerie of paper animals. Morgenstern's creations are fantastically descriptive, and titular circus would indeed be an awesome place to visit.<br /><br />The story focuses not only on how the contest affects Celia and Marco, but also on those unwittingly caught up in the \\"game.\\" A secondary plot focuses on Bailey, a boy who falls in love with both the circus and one of its performers. The two stories converge at the end, and the payoff is overall pretty satisfying.<br /><br />There are also short interludes told in the second person, documenting the reader's own tour through the circus. While there is a nice twist to these in the end, oftentimes they seem redundant as Bailey especially seems to encounter many of the same things. The romance aspect is also a bit forced; the reader is told Celia and Marco love each other, but the relationship doesn't seem that developed.<br /><br />The Night Circus is certainly worth visiting, especially for fans of magical realism.<br /><br />A review copy was provided by the publisher.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am not able to \\"lose myself\\" in this book as I did in Harry Potter.  Plot, characters, writing just ok. Took a long time for the plot to get my interest. If it wasn't written by JK Rowling I would not be putting the effort into finishing it.
0375507256|4.0|Cloud Atlas is less a traditional novel and more a collection of inter-related short stories. The book begins as the journal of Adam Ewing, an American traveling in the Pacific near New Zealand in the mid 1800s. Ewing's diary is subsequently discovered and read in 1930 by Robert Frobisher, an English music student who has apprenticed himself to a renowned composer. Frobisher has escaped to Belgium both to elude his creditors and pursue his musical ambitions; his story is told in letters to his friend Rufus Sixsmith. Sixsmith appears as a character in a novella set in 1970s, in which reporter Luisa Rey seeks to expose a coverup regarding to safety of a California nuclear power plant. This novella is submitted for publication in the next story to Timothy Cavendish, who comically finds himself trapped in a nursing home against his will. A film version of Cavendish's story survives into a dystopian future, where it is watched by Sonmi 451, a genetically engineered clone made to work in a fast-food restaurant. A holographic recording of Sonmi is finally discovered by Zachry, a member of a post-apocalyptic civilization on the island of Hawaii.<br /><br />What's unique about Cloud Atlas is the arrangement of the stories; each is interrupted midway due to the circumstances of the next character. Frobisher, for example, finds half of Ewing's diary to be missing. The stories are nested such that they resume in reverse order as the future characters discover or resume the remaining half themselves.<br /><br />Mitchell plays with different narrative styles and genres, and is able to pull each of them off rather well. Some of the stories are a bit stronger than others, and I personally liked the two future stories the best. Frobisher's story was the slowest, but may appeal to those who prefer historical fiction.<br /><br />While overall a bit misanthropic, there is a feeling of hope underlying each story as well. It's also hinted that many of the characters may in fact be the same souls reincarnated. There's a little something for everyone in Cloud Atlas, from historical fiction to science fiction dystopia. Regardless of whether the upcoming movie is successful, the novel is definitely worth checking out.
B00914JWSW|5.0|There are few singers who can release tracks recorded over a span of 44 years and make the sum appear so seamless and intentional, and yet that's what makes Barbra Streisand unique among pop vocalists. To call her a legend would be clich&eacute; at this point. She has dabbled in all sorts of musical genres over the course of her storied career, and this wonderful disc of previously unreleased tracks proves she was willing to take chances while remaining true to her mellifluent tonal quality and innate dramatic sense. I have listened to snatches of some of these songs over the years usually through some resourceful superfan who would post them on YouTube over montages of age-appropriate images. However, Streisand takes full charge of what comes out of her own vault this time, and there are a number of gems to be discovered and in a few cases, re-discovered.<br /><br />The disc opens with a pristine outtake from 1985's [[ASIN:B00005V3XG The Broadway Album]], the dramatically escalating \\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough\\" from the failed civil rights musical, \\"Hallelujah, Baby!\\", by Jule Styne, Betty Comden and Adolph Green. The bombastic orchestral arrangement suits her theatrical instincts quite well. This track was jettisoned for Stephen Sondheim's more satirically pointed \\"Putting It Together\\" as the opener to \\"The Broadway Album\\". Jimmy Webb's \\"Didn't We\\" has been part of Streisand's canon for years, but surprisingly, a studio recording has never made it to an album before this. While I like the clean 1970 version presented, it lacks the stylistic touches found in her performance of this song on the unaired \\"David Frost Show\\" that has been floating on YouTube for years or even the more ragged version on the [[ASIN:B0012GN2LA Live Concert at the Forum]] album.<br /><br />From the 1967 [[ASIN:B0012GMZ54 Simply Streisand]] sessions, \\"Willow Weep for Me\\" is the earliest recording included here, and it shows her youthful virtuosic approach working well within the jazzy-blue Ray Ellis arrangement of this Billie Holliday standard. Recorded for 1977's [[ASIN:B0012GMYL4 Superman]] as she was learning to play the guitar, Larry Gatlin's \\"Try to Win a Friend\\" is one of her rare forays into country, and it's a nice if anomalous ballad which she sings with twangy sincerity. Taken from the 1970 [[ASIN:B0012GN3GY Stoney End]] sessions, her simple rendition of Randy Newman's \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\\", accompanied only by his piano, is similar to the cut that did make the album (\\"I'll Be Home\\"), but I love the haunting chord changes and elliptical images that evoke the melancholy of the heavy outreach message conveyed. It's truly the most timeless cut on the disc.<br /><br />The studio recording of \\"With One More Look at You\\" is a surprise with a full orchestra, soulful back-up singers and its loping mid-seventies arrangement. I don't think it's an improvement over the version that made the soundtrack album, but without the context of the movie, it somehow works as a piece of period pop music. Bossa nova legend Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Antigua\\" turned into quite a trippy song called \\"Lost in Wonderland\\" courtesy of the intricately confusing lyrics by Marshall Barer. Amazingly, she recorded this performance in one take in 1968 and captures the \\"Ipanema\\" sway effortlessly along the way. Recorded for an aborted [[ASIN:B00138KM9M Back To Broadway]] album in 1988, the concept of which was resuscitated a few years later, the seamless medley of \\"How Are Things in Glocca Morra?\\" from \\"Finian's Rainbow\\" and \\"Heather on the Hill\\" from \\"Brigadoon\\" has been a staple for years on YouTube.<br /><br />The shimmering beauty of her performance remains unabated with a lovely introductory section I never heard before. The Bergmans are represented twice here, first with 1973's \\"Mother and Child\\" from an abandoned album project they were working on with Michel Legrand. It's an epic lullaby that turns into a highly theatrical duet with Streisand playing both parts quite effusively. The second is an outtake from last year's tribute album, [[ASIN:B0058A119G What Matters Most - Barbra Streisand Sings The Lyrics of Alan And Marilyn Bergman]], the melancholic \\"If It's Meant to Be\\" in which Streisand's burnished tones provide an affecting denouement to the disc. The last song chosen, however, is a driving, ABBA-esque cover of \\"Home\\" from \\"The Wiz\\" recorded during \\"The Broadway Album\\" sessions. It may lack the innocent yearning of previous versions, but Streisand doesn't pretend to be a Kansas girl. She makes the song a declarative statement of her recording career. Yes, this one is a must for fans.ite effusively.

B009KHDT0C|4.0|I rented this because I'd seen the promos that looked funny. This movie is a comedy, but as expected it's 'dark' without as much humor as I would have liked. It's there, and it's smart, but I was just hoping for more.<br /><br />Since I had not seen the television show my mind wasn't tainted with what should have been. I viewed the movie without any preconceived notions; not having read any reviews here or elsewhere. That was probably a good thing. Nothing to compare it to and not a diehard fan of the series, I found it enjoyable.<br /><br />Depp was excellent, as usual and his supporting cast very good as well. Tim Burton didn't disappoint this viewer, but it was different than expected.<br /><br />It's not for kids. Both the sexual references, and scary gore would be too much for most under 12. Remember, he's a vampire and needs to feed.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fairly mild Halloween-ish movie, with a few laughs, some nostalgic 70's references and mild discomfort from anxious anticipation of what might come next with vampires and ghosts, this one is for you. It's also for Johnny Depp fans. Yes, a bit like Jack Sparrow and Edward Scissorhands, but you won't mind.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|Whether you like action, war, or fantasy this novel should be your very next read. Ryan creates a familiar yet unique world of cynical hope. Plenty of action, but enough development of character and description of place to put you into the world. I appreciated the way the book stuck with a single perspective and yet still provided an epic panorama of the world in which it took place. So many authors use disparate story lines to complete the picture yet Ryan gives it all to us in one flowing perspective.<br /><br />Mr. Ryan, thank you for writing and self publishing this amazing work. I eagerly await the remainder of the trilogy.
0525953728|4.0|Enjoyed this book but if all the action was saved for the last 20%, it was missing some grit or something else engaging to help the first 80%
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I freaking love this app!!! I have tried soo many different apps just like this one and they all dissappointed me.. but this is the best one yet
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is sooooo good.  Love the different parts of the game.  Everyone in my house plays it, and I have all my friends hooked on it too.
B00846REIS|1.0|I have never felt the need to write a review before. This is my first because I really cant believe so many have given this book 5 stars. Really?!<br /><br />It was so hard to like these characters. Some parts just laughable and not in a good way but in a .\\"this is so cheesy I cant help but laugh kind of way\\". I felt like I was watching a really bad porn, the kind with no plot just sex. Unless you enjoy that type of reading then you might like this book. If not,  save your money. I will not be reading the next book.
0812993292|2.0|This book was hard to read.  Very boring at first.  Then it picked up a little and was enjoyable for about three or four chapters.  After that it was just plain bad and very sad.  I had to read this for a book club book and everyone felt pretty much the same.  When I have the time to read I want to read something uplifting and this was definitely not uplifting.  Sorry would not recommend.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good time waster.  runs like a Facebook app. coins add to your bank roll over time, and your limit increases as you lvl up.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Like being able to see at a glance the level life in my kindle. Very nice its fun just to look at
B0061Q13V2|5.0|Great book written by a fantastic role model for young, aspiring gymnasts. Even if your not a die-hard gym fan, her story will touch you.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Have used for a while now to control my home and work computers from my Kindle Fire. It has worked well for me.
B006M4RN3U|3.0|There is 2 very good songs on here, just got a little tired of it.  It is a good CD though.
B00509OFE8|1.0|Terrible show. There is a reason they were not allowed to wear any official USAF insignias. Everyone on the ship was whiny and had teenage angst. Should have never been made.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I watched the whole concert advertised on TV & had to get it along w/ the CD.  The cast has such excellent singers.  The one actress was so amazing & she will play the same character in the Les Miserables that comes to theaters in December.  She is the best I have ever seen play/sing that role.
1452101426|5.0|The artwork is illustrious and highly detailed for an animation feature film. I love the mood, tones, and colors of each piece.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|Its def worth watching @ least once, but I think I was expecting too much from it.  Although the ending did make up for other parts of the movie!  Its not for kids, there is a disturbing scene or 2.
B000024QML|2.0|I was compelled to buy this album on my past pleasant experiences with PSB albums, and the lead single and first track of the album \\"Can You Forgive Her?\\". Little did I know that after a couple of tracks I was going to receive a VERY RUDE AND VERY LOUD AWAKENING!!! Apparently the PSBs decided to stuff every single electronic bell and whistle in their tracks - sort of what New Order songs sound like towards the end when every instrument is set to \\"10\\" in volume level. It was totally unnecessary and uncalled for. Best tracks are 1,2,3 9 and 12. The rest is unlistenable, both as songs and as production pieces. Extremely annoying. Unfortunately the PSBs began an abusive relationship with electronic sounds that only got worse in future albums, save for \\"Bilingual\\" where they remembered their job was to make music, not punish or torture. Despite the attractive plastic \\"Lego\\" orange CD box, this album soon found its way to the secondhand CD store.  The tracks I picked are the PSBs at the top of their game, and where the Pac Man, Space Invaders and Centipede sounds are missing. The rest is a tragedy.
0783225482|5.0|I watched this movie in the movie theater when I was a child.  I had to add this movie to my collection.  It is extremely funny & entertaining.  The hospital scene is beyond funny still even after memorizing this movie.  Its a must see!
B007SAKY42|5.0|I bought the vinyl box instead of the CD box as I prefer the albums in their original incarnation, plus the sound (at least to my ears) is better. I haven't finished listening to ALL records, but as soon as I am done I will revisit this review and update it.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Most people would regard Lynn Sknnrd as leading southern rock outfit and rightly so. There are many others who were labelled as such. Outlaws, Allman , Molly Hatchet, Marshall Tucker etc. In my view L skynn and Outlaws do it for me because they sound southern sing about the south play a mix of rock and country but not all out rock nor all out country somewhere in between. Black Smoke are like this . Songs are clever well written catchy and sound southern whatever that may mean now. It is a great southern rock CD and so is \\"piece of dixie.\\" Buy it and judge for yourself!
B0018Q4DTY|5.0|A classic album that needs to be listened to by real hip hop fans. This might not be the album that put them on the map, but one that shows their original style.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Was a great book.  Easy read and a different perspective on that particular time period.  Will read more by this author.  Just wish they would enable text-to-speech.  I can get through more books!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|a great app for the time between classes. the recharge rate while offline is a bit slow, but all in all a solid app
B00526ZKYS|5.0|A four letter  word. This kept me on the edge of my seat until the last page. great read in dystopian fiction.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Only 2 complaints: that it takes a long time for Pinterest to pull up the images when I pin from a site and that sometimes the program freezes when it opens. Otherwise, it's as great as the full version.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I was apprehensive to read this memoir.  However, I felt compelled to read it after I saw the 20/20 interview with Jaycee Dugard. Although some parts made me cringe, each chapter contained a \\"Reflections\\" section which brought the reader back to the present moment.  Jaycee Dugard is inspiring. She is not bitter or self-pitying. I am still curious about her mother and half-sister's relationship with her stepfather Carl.  He was verbally abusive to Jaycee and caused her great pain before she was abducted.
B002OTO38K|3.0|I love the plot but the acting leaves much to be desired. However I still highly recommend viewing this movie as it does give some wonderful insight into the struggles of being transgender.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|its very easy at first and challenges you through out the whole game!!! cant put it down once you start!!
0525953728|5.0|This book is a great book and for that say he is a sell out no he is telling the truth and some people cant handle the truth
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was very apprehensive to read it after reading some of the negative reviews. I am so glad I decided to read it as I loved every bit of it. My emotions went through the ringer...... Brilliant story , gripping till the very end!
B007N8RULO|5.0|love....my weekly flights and airport lounge go really fast. use it everyday..kids love the game too,..I recommend it. if you spend a lot of delay time at airport, then get this.
B002G1K82Q|1.0|There is a lot about this movie to like.  The vignettes associated with the various songs worked well enough. Unfortunately there is blatant autotuning applied to much of the singing - like  pop country music.  Why are we not allowed to hear the actual singers' voices without this manipulation? It is very off-putting.  Technology destroys art.
B00006BIO0|4.0|The music is great.  Some of the recordings are pretty grainy, but I don't really mind that so much.  But each disk has songs from other people.  I don't know why... this was supposed to be a Charley Patton box set.  But it does have all his recordings so you are getting what you pay for.  In a sense you get a little extra with the other tracks from other artist... but I would prefer the set without them.
B007THA4FI|4.0|[[ASIN:B007THA4FI The Casual Vacancy] I loved the Harry Potter Books and could hardly wait to read an adult story by J.K. Rowling--I am not sure what I expected--this is a serious story full of social problems--as you read you are drawn into the lives of the characters--you cry with them--you laugh with them--you wish for them a better way of life--we the readers--begin to understand this is our world--we are the ones who can make this world better--the book is thoughtful and strangely compelling--Thank You--J.K. Rowling--I love the way you put the words together!
144234430X|4.0|The book was so incredible I purchased the audio MP3 to listen to while working/driving.  The reading is good but not as engaging as \\"Hearts In Atlantis\\" was.  The unabridged aspect is outstanding although I had to take into mind \\"sensitive ears\\" while driving due to the sometimes graphic/realistic language and depictions of drama.<br /><br />Great story and a good read/listen.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I received my copy of the new Tim Burton / Johnny Depp version of Dark Shadows today. Loved the movie!  I knows lots of people expected a horror flick but not I! It was as good as Edward Scissorhands which has become a classic!I give this new 2012 version five stars!<br />Thank you Amazon for getting it to me so quickly!
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was an interesting read.  I did not like the ending of the book.  It kind of left you hanging.  Harry Potter was much better.  She should sit at home and collect her royalties.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|It's fun and fast.  The graphics are pretty good and the game play is fairly fast.  What is nice is that a lot of the thinking goes away because they show you what moves you can make, so you don't waste time.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|IMHO  the best Dylan cd since Time Out of Mind.  The changes leave more room for dylans lyrics which are strong on this new one. I recommend you give it a listen.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the third book in the series (Bet you didnt know THAT already! )And,like the other 3 books, IT IS SO AWESOME!!!!! DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT  (Should I repeat again?)TURN THIS BOOK DOWN!!! IF OTHER PEOPLE SAY THIS IS NOT A GOOD BOOK, THEY ARE SOME DUMB CRITIC WHO HAS NO IDEA WHAT A GOOD BOOK IS!!!! *pant pant* So yeah I would definitely recommend this book to you! It tells you a lot about the feelings of the different charchters, Annabeth and Percy are finally reunited!*YAY* EPIC FIGHTS! And a suprise ending you will never forget! Another great book by Rick Riordan!  :D
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! It was totally engaging and fun to watch, especially after watching Iron Man I & II, Thor, and Captain America. A classic!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Just purchased and received this order, I added a blu-ray player and flat screen tv to my home theatre system, what a diff.. so this is one of my first major blu-rays<br />I love it, even though not a avid Alien's fan the price was reasonable and packaging really meant a treat.. the new installment \\"Prometheus\\" had rekindled my interest in Alien's, my favorite of the four is \\"Alien's\\" , the story and acting plus the sound track are awesome, even after 25 yrs+ the action and effects are put together very well.  there is a extended version of that \\"Alien's\\" with about 20 minutes more. and I did watch it and for me it really doesn't add any thing more to the story, maybe if that extended was released to the public first it might of made a difference.. But I guess I could say I love the version that was released to public back in '86. Other reviewer's gave a more extensive review so no need to go on, A good addition to my home theatre system...
0920668364|5.0|I just bought this for my grandson. I had it when my sons were little and read it to them all the time.  There's a part in the book where the mother sings \\"I love you forever, I'll like for always, As long as I\\"m living, My baby you'll be...\\"  I made up a melody and always sang that to my boys and they loved it (even if my melody wasn't very good)...the sentiment was there...I will always be there for them..<br />I just bought the hardcover version, but my children had the paperback...just as good (but since this was a gift I thought I would spent a little more...)<br />[[ASIN:0920668372 Love You Forever]]
0525953728|3.0|Too much profileration  - the  technical side is lacking.  The reference materials they used when trying to describe weapons is not fully described.  The title is misleading in that yoou think yoou willbe reading about actual weapons, but the book is like so many others and is more political then technical
B0053O89K6|5.0|I just bought the 8th season to give to my son for Christmas (he has seasons 1-7 already).  He doesn't watch much TV, but HOUSE is one of his favorite shows.  I know he will enjoy this...
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Although I do not think this is PG movie, I do think that this is a fantastic movie for all adults. (I'm sure I would have loved it as a teen as well.)<br />This is brilliant movie for all of those who enjoy a brilliantly crafted story with plenty of imagination and action. I do not want to take anything away from the movie or give anything away. I will only say that if you like such films as Princes Bride, Pirates, LOR, Star Trek (newest one); you will find that this movie is up there in imagination and entertainment.<br />I do understand that tastes are different for everyone out there, so if you are unsure about this movie as I was...rent it. Instant Stream it via Amazon or Netflix and check it out.<br />My wife who was at first reluctant to watch it, now can't stop watching it. It was a great experience to watch her go from uncertainty, disdain, amazement, laughter, and now her go to movie in the evenings.<br /><br />Legen-wait for it.....DARY! LEGENDARY!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Always a fan of follett, I picked this one up based off the great amazon reviews.  I haven't been able to put it down.  I'm loving following along with the subjects of the book as they unravel the mysteries of war time.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have really enjoyed reading Ken Follett over the years, and the first edition of this trilogy was excellent. This middle portion was an enjoyable read, but it seemed at times that keeping up the characters stories took away some from the narrative. I would have liked to have seen more depth in fewer characters, but I will stay on the ride for the final installment.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am an avid reader and was looking forward to reading JK's new book as I have so much respect for her, but was disappointed with the read. There were too many characters and the story line was lacking excitement with an obvious ending.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Only five days before my grandson's fourth birthday, I learned that he wanted only the Star Wars Trilogy for a gift but his parents couldn't find it anywhere in stores, except for the blue-ray version (they don't have a blue-ray player).  I found a wealth of information on Amazon and this great seller (who was already given lots of great reviews).  The great price (lower than most) along with the excellent (discs were brand new, box looked new, too) made a little boy's dream come true.  I would recommend this seller to anyone and I will definitely order from them again.  Oh, yes, the package came one day before Devon's birthday!
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book was well written, but just not my cup of tea. It was a well woven tale of a middle class town.  However, if it hadn't been a JK Rowling book, I wouldn't have given it a second look on the shelf.  JK once again proved herself to be an excellent author, but fans of the Harry Potter series might have trouble jumping over to the new genre with her.
B000O78KW4|5.0|This is a Great Bruce Willis Movie<br />It has him in a very aggressive role but<br />in complete control of what is happening<br />A must see movie if you are a Bruce willis Fan<br />Buy it from Amazon and enjoy some great adventure in this story<br />chfancier<br />fancier of fine movies
B009MO5960|5.0|While no one can accuse the Resident Evil series of being too brainy, the films are all prime examples of one important factor frequently missing from today's films: FUN.<br /><br />Much like the Transformers films, these aren't meant to change the world or make you think deep thoughts. It's just meant to inspire a good time. The critics of the series typically fall into two categories: people overly attached to the games who don't realize that film adaptations aren't meant to be the same as what they adapt (otherwise you'd have two of the same thing for no reason), and people who seem to think they know everything including what art is and assume everything should be molded to their standards.<br /><br />(And the films are better than the games, anyway, in my opinion.)<br /><br />RETRIBUTION is no exception the any of this. In fact, I believe it's the best film in the series. The directing, acting, story, special effects, music, and cinematography are all top notch for the budget. Especially for the budget. If you're watching this movie to have a good time you won't guess the film-makers spent less than $150 million for this movie. I looks and sounds great.<br /><br />I can't speak for the DVD/Blu-ray because they aren't out yet, but the previous home releases all have a good selection of bonus features that make the purchase worth it! So never mind the negative Nancy BS that so many reviewers provide and give this awesome action film a try!
B007TK77QE|1.0|I was curious to see if it would compare favourably with the Harry Potter books. Sadly it did not. I was totally bored and did not finish reading it. Very , very disappointed.
0316228532|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book.  Yes I read all of the Harry Potter books and loved them.  I also read Dickens, Russo, Irving, Wodehouse and lots of other authors this new book would supposedly be compared to.  I hate to say it, but good lord, I was amazingly disappointed.  Disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  I was barely able to keep reading.  I finished this book only because it was by J.K. Rowling.  I am too old to spend time reading books that, after more than 100 pages of reading, I just don't like.  I decided to make an exception of this novel.  I expected a story about class struggle and death, but I also expected some humor.  The book is devoid of any real humor, it is simply depressing.  There is also no desire to feel any kind of sympathy for any of the characters, because you never really get a chance to like any of them from the beginning.  There are so many characters to keep up with in this book that you would think some of them would be likable.  they aren't.  I\\"m sorry.  I won't recap the book, everyone reading this probably has an idea.  I cannot recommend this book.  I hate to say it, but there it is.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|Bones are forever was not my favorite Kathy Reichs book. It dragged a little. I liked the facts about Canada the were pretty spot on. I thougt the price was a little high on this book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|There are many ways to look at an event like the capture/kill of Osama Bin Laden. All of them can be correct from their viewpoint. But the view of a Navy Seal who participated in the actual raid gives a view unlike the view that of any other. In our time, Osama Bin Laden was a great evil, killing and maiming innocents in a quest to destroy the United States. That this raid was even politically possible is amazing. Consider the fallout if Great Britain had mounted a full scale military operation to attack a home just outside of Washington DC. I took these thoughts away with me after reading this book. The uproar in the administration about this book made it just that much more interesting to readd. It's well written, moves along nicely, and is really full of interesting information and thoughts. I don't see anything in it that I haven't seen in either fact or fiction based books on special forces, so I don't know what the frenzy about this book was.
0670026182|5.0|I'd stumbled about for a review title and finally went with my first thought: Food Porn.<br /><br />I have never seen a book quite like this one... I still have to stop myself from reaching out and trying to grab the food in the pictures. You should hear my stomach growling. *sigh*<br /><br />Without a doubt this is the most attractive cookbook that I've seen in ages. It's a large book done in a very casual friendly style, all beiges and darker colors, with a very retro typewriter style font. I feel like I'm viewing a close friend(Hemmingway? ;-)'s food journal, complete with stained pages. It is rife with wonderful color pictures, most zoomed in so that the food is pictured life-sized. Hence the difficulty with my self-control; I've never wanted to eat a book before. A+++++ on the styling.<br /><br />(The book is broken down into: Introduction; Tips & Tricks; Breakfasts; Lunches; Salads; Canapes & Drinks; Dinners; Sides & Sauces; Desserts; Thank you!; and an index.)<br /><br />As for the recipes themselves: I've already marked out several. I'm a vegetarian, but I do cook meat for the carnivores in my family; there are recipes for all of us here. Colm's Soup (an amped-up tomato soup) had me drooling. The Couscous Salad with Slow-roasted Tomatoes, Chickpeas and Eggs is, colorwise, Christmas on a plate. The Beef and Guinness Pie is on my list to make for my brother-in-law. The Roast Pork with Apple, Apricot and Pistachio Stuffing is a holiday dinner (for the carnivores :-) option, with the Pumpkin Ravioli with Brown-Butter Sauce and Roasted Pecans for the vegetarians. Or maybe Jill's Veggie Roll. Mmmmm.<br /><br />Ah, spoiled for choices.<br /><br />All I can add is that I can't stress enough that you *shouldn't* touch this book if you're hungry. Trust me, the pictures look so real that you'll drive yourself crazy. Oooh! Kate's Irish Mash. Sorry. It's a beautiful book with recipes that I can actually see myself using; perfection.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I really, really liked their first CD (SNM)  Often times when pushed by producers and fans an artist or band feels pressure on the second release to hurry.  And then sometimes,  well disappointment.  NOT with these guys.<br />Great music filled with passion!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thank you for your service to this country. And thanks for sharing the facts. Non stop read from cover to cover.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read the first book and now on my second love it........ I plan on buying the third book also
B005IQZB14|5.0|My daughter recommended this book and I really loved it. It is very well written and at times I felt as if I was on the trail with her. What she did was very brave and a little reckless but it got her through a difficult time in her life. Seeing her progress on the PCT as well as her emotional growth is what this book is about. I think she ended up seeing the world in a different way.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent trilogy!!  Love all the books and each one is better than the last one!!! Wish there were more books to the series!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This was by far one of the worst films that I have seen. The plot was not organised, and the story was very disjointed. There were too many things left unexplained. This film might have been great 15 years ago. Without the big names behind it, this would have been seen as the big flop it really is.
0517548232|5.0|This book is a great introduction to free market economics.  For the most part it is easy to understand without any prior training in economics, although there are passages that are a bit over the heads of complete beginners. (like myself).  It is not really so much a primer on basic economics but rather an argument (and a convincing one) on why free market principles are superior to economic policies favoring heavy handed government intervention. And to this end, the book is excellent. I wish I could get all the liberals to read it.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great quality, funny and great storyline. Amazon is one of the easiest to deal with in renting, buying or just browsing for whatever, whenever anytime!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|THIS GAME is waaaay better then any game I played you can do 2 player and play with anybody in NORTH AMERICA or where you live I would not Recommend this to 5- but if maturer. You can have 2 handed weapons and 1 this game is SWEET! As I said I love this game.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie arrived in great condition.The story was one that kept me watching it and not stopping until it was over.I will watch again and again.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|Based on all the hype from the past several months i was expecting a brutally heavy album from KISS.Well heavy it is...but heavy alone does not a great album make.\\"Sonic Boom\\" marked the guys return to album making for the first time in 10 years and it was a very decent effort,nothing great but a solid return to form.A sign of better things to hopefully come.Unfortunately \\"Monster\\" is only a few points better than SB and that's not necessarily a bad thing it's just that i expected a little more growth from this album than what i got.It seems that Paul Stanley tried on several tracks to bring an element of say \\"Revenge\\" to the proceedings but without a Bob Ezrin at the helm it dosen't quite make it.<br /><br />The good to great points of \\"Monster\\" is some solid songwriting on the part of Stanley and some good heavy riffs with some great bass tones from Gene.Both he and Paul are fine vocally if not a bit more gritty and mature sounding that i believe  works in their favor here.\\"Hell Or Hallelujah\\",\\"Freak\\" \\"Long Way Down\\" \\"The Devil Is Me\\" (could you imagine what EC or VV could have brought to this track!)\\"Last Chance\\" and bonus track \\"Right Here,Right Now\\" are the standouts for me.If more of the songs were reminiscent of the bonus track that would have been a good thing as it is better than most on here.<br /><br />Tommy Thayer is thankfully doing more that an \\"cut and paste\\" job with Frehleys past work as his playing is stellar if not overwhelming.I would just hope that if Kiss were to record another album someone would give a tip to him or Paul that just because he now portrays the \\"Spaceman\\" character that does not indicate that every song he performs need be about space,lightning the weather etc...although his track here \\"Outta This World\\" is not a bad effort at all.Cool chorus.<br /><br />The bad points i would like to make about \\"Monster\\" is Genes apparent disability to write a decent lyric anymore.His songs are really good musically but the lyric writing is pretty bad cornball stuff.On \\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" he even recycles some lyrics from SB.Did he think know one would notice? Lazy stuff here!Speaking of recycling you can pretty much play spot the riff with several songs lifting or paying tribute to the MC5,Mountain,The Stones,The Guess Who,AC/DC and even Pauls own \\"It's Alright\\" from his first solo album on \\"All for the Love of Rock 'n' Roll\\" which sounds so much like a Peter Criss tune he may as well have been asked to sit in on this track.And where are the drums on this album? Very puny sounding i might add.For all of Eric Singers technical expertise i don't feel that there's a drum beat on here that the REAL catman couldn't have played himself.And also for all of their disrespect for Peter and Ace they sure seem to go out of their way to at least make it seem that their here which shows that they know they were a critical part of their successes.Too bad that Eric only truly gets to shine on the bonus track.<br /><br />Also i feel that the album could/should have been trimmed down to ten tracks as \\"Shout Mercy\\",\\"Eat Your Heart Out\\" and the tacky but funny \\"Take Me Down Below\\" could have been left off for a better flow.Sometimes it seems that things are to busy and noisy on here.Maybe a ballad should have been represented to balance things out a bit.<br /><br />But for all of the faults i find with \\"Monster\\" i can find just as many positives.And maybe some things i dislike will grow on me the more i listen.I would just hope that next time (if this isn't it and let's hope it's not)that maybe they would consider maybe Mr. Ezrin or Eddie Kramer or heck maybe even Michael James Jackson to come in and lend an extra pair of ears and some co-writers may not hurt either.It's a fun listen with some good to really good songs and i for one am truly grateful that Kiss have decided to continue to record.There's just nothing here that i find to be truly \\"Monsterous.\\"
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie came in great condition and the story will keep you on your toes while watching it.Can't wait for the next chaper to arrive.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not stop reading. I did not even see the twist in the_ plot coming. Well done Suzanne Collins!
B007X4ECMI|5.0|This movie came to me in very good condition.I am glad to have bought this movie and I know that friends will watch it.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|As a complete Halo n00b, I searched for the most effective way to immerse myself in the Halo story from the beginning. I was recommended to start reading the books, whilst playing the first Halo (Combat Evolved Anniversary) in the series. Due to my short attention span I don't normally have much success reading fiction, but I found this book nearly impossible to put down, with intense action scenes and cleverly developed characters. This book has done an awesome job of exposing the tip of the Halo iceberg, for what appears to be a deep and thoughtful story that underpins the game. Highly recommended.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I really don't have much else to say but \\"amazing\\". It was so well written and real.<br /><br />I can't wait for the film!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I really like this app. I love puzzles. I really like it because you can buy more picture puzzles.  I just wish it had an option for 300 or 500 pieces.  Also I would like to be able to change the color of the background board. That's why I gave it 4 stars.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|Quick read! Very motivating, fascinating and informative.  I started my diet...with coaching and have lost 8 lbs in two weeks plus 2 inches off hips, waist and thighs.  I highly recommend for someone who is resistant to weight loss with other diets.  Especially if you are perimenopausal.  This diet shocks the body and throws it off guard.  Only requirement is you must follow the rules, no cheating at all! And you must complete all phases and follow the lifetime rule.  You will find out some very important little known facts about foods like certain fruit that you should never eat and why!  Don't pass up this great opportunity to change your life.  Read the book and then commit!  Magic will happen.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked it. I liked how he talked about dying people only being heroes after death,that's  true. The philosophy was lost on me though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the trilogy when I turned 11.  Though this seems a young age, it is not.  Sure, there are some parts that most would think are morbid, but I am unlike most, and I would quite like to stay that way.  Just like Katniss.  Even though she is a celebrity whose every detail is known all across Panem, she is still herself.  Sometimes, people try to change her, but she stays true to herself.  So, if you are saying that kids should keep their faces out of these books, you re sadly mistaken, and now, you know why.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|After listening to the album half a dozen times I actually really love it.  Sounds very live to me as well.
0525953728|5.0|I have no doubt that this book contains a true account of taking out Osama Bin Laden. Also, the reader can get a bit of an idea of what the life of a SEAL is like. It would be a good idea to read this book before watching any Hollywood rendition of the events.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Great game keeps you looking for more like hidden clues.and the puzzles.very good app hope more come along soon.<br />Like it very much.Mike
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was amazing . It had me burning with anticipation for the next page. The characters were good.I love this series
B0050XFY4O|4.0|The subject of two brothers in love (half-brothers, actually) would seem to be the main hurdle to get over in order to enjoy this film. I would - kindly, gently - suggest you get over it. This is a beautiful, very sweet and ultimately very moving film - and one that is surprisingly sunny considering it's a story about death and incest as much as it is about the trials and joys of love.<br /><br />Wonderfully, naturally and subtly acted - no, embodied - by an attractive cast and filmed with a languor that is suitable to Brazil, I would highly recommend this to anyone with an open mind and an unjaded heart.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|this time,i was trying to stick close to home,so i looked at schleich's new dinosaur line,including the [[ASIN:B0073QNIH6 Schleich Allosaurus]],[[ASIN:B0073QYC2G Schleich Giganotosaurus]],[[ASIN:B0073RQMBY Schleich Velociraptor]],and this tyrannosaurus. i had wanted an albertosaurus,so i looked,and i was close to getting the [[ASIN:B0073QNIH6 Schleich Allosaurus]] (because allosaurus behaved like albertosaurus) ,but i figured this looked more like an albertosaurus,and i could make him act how i wanted. plus i already had the papo [[ASIN:B0014YPEI4 Allosaurus]] of equal detail and it to had a moveable jaw,so it was set. this guy gives off an instant jurassic park vibe,which itself gives off an awesome vibe. his toe claws do shed paint,so don't bang him around to much,but as for the rest of the body,it's survived many falls and looks just as good as the day i picked it up. as for the jaw,does it match papo's? well,the tongue looks super awesome,his teeth have little grey/silver spots to make it more realistic (papo's allosaurus,the one i'm comparing it with dosen't have this.) and the back of the mouth is pink,as if prey could really go down the throat. there's those little skin things between the upper and lower jaw (right below the eye) in excellent detail. moving on,the neck has gold spots,a nice exclusive touch to put it aside from papo's,and really mark it as a schleich product. the feet,hands,\\"horns\\" over the eyes,and belly are all gold as well. the knee's have the gold spots too. besides these exclusive to schleich gold touches,the body is mostly dark green,but the light green highlights dotting it cover it mostly. for some these may seem haphazard and random,but they are a nice detail touch to me. as for the pose,looking at it from in front,it looks as if it's looking up at something,maybe tasty pterosaur? or army helicopters trying to send it to the past once more? this pose offers tons of possibilities. move the jaw and,as with papo's allosaurus,like magic,he suddenly is roaring up,challenging that flying whatever-it-may-be to a battle.  his eyes are green,and add to the curious look of the pose and expression drastically. one last note,i'm not sure if this one's supposed to include it,but the copy i got didn't include the little \\"booklet\\" that the allo,giganoto,and raptor i saw had. but that dosen't subtract in the slightest from the quality of this toy. overall,the ultimate albertosaurus and probably the ultimate tyrannosaurus,too!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|An interesting account of what really happened.<br />I can remember when soldiers went into battle with a rifle, a tin hat and an ammo belt. Today's warriors carry 60 pounds of gear, including body armor, radios, night-vision goggles, various weapons, etc. etc.<br />I didn't find any info that might be considered a breach of national security. Certainly, the Seals had little use for the Obama White House, but that is hardly surprising. I'm supposing that the \\"official outrage\\" over the publication of the book was a political matter. A really good read about some really brave people.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am extremely disappointed in this book. It does not in my opinion hold a candle to Ms. Rolwing's Harry Potter Series. To me it seems confused, poorly organized, full of extreme and unecessary bad language... and a not very interesting plot. Ms. Rowling, whose creation of the Harry Potter Books was brilliant, can surely do much better than this first attempt at an adult novel.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this collection of short stories/novellas so much that I almost feel like I need to go back to old reviews and reduce many of the 5-starred ones to make this stand out even more. I find it really hard to believe that this is a self-published work, just based on books by other authors. The Wool Omnibus was enthusiastically recommended my another knitter, and the mostly subtle references to the craft were a treat. (I would really like to know where the wool cleaning pads came from, because sheep are never mentioned, but there is a hint in the afterward about more stories in the series, so there's a chance that mystery will be solved.) Never fear - you don't have to be a knitter or craft with fiber in any way to enjoy this book; the fabric details are just a bonus. It does help if you enjoy post-apocalyptic sci-fi and strong female characters.<br /><br />I anxiously await the next installment.
B00007L4OM|2.0|Recommended for somebody who never been in Japan or Tokyo. Movie kinda straight forward, a lot of useless action, suited for ages between 10 and 14. The producer never took advantage of being in Tokyo and, in short, I had seen this types of movies at least 1000 times. Please, teacher! You see some fancy shopping, fancy hotel and fancy criminals but you dont see real Japan. Yes, a lot of criminals are killed, I guess Japan has no shortage of them.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love this series.  It's smart and topical and well-written.  I'm always glad to find a show where I can't wait to see the next episode.  This one doesn't have a lot of \\"movie stupid\\" in it either (as in, characters doing something really dumb just to further the plot)...wish there were more shows like this.
0307593525|4.0|Good writing, interesting, with a touch of vintage. Classical school of cooking with good fundamentals technique of French cooking and a lot of details. Bon apppetit!
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I am not going to say this is a great album, but it is good.  I didn't want to like this album, my expectations were low going in, but I can say that I do like it.  When I listened to this album the first time, I instantly thought that if the Cars became a band right now, this is probably a little bit what they would sound like...The Cars mixed in with a little bit of Coldplay.  I enjoy the former much more than the latter.  I picture listening to this album in my car, at night with the Windows down...it is that type...nothing that you would listen to blaring through town during the day, just a nice album that flows nicely from start to finish.  Runaways and A Matter of Time were the standouts for me.  The album did seem to be building to something that I do not think it ever really got to, but much more good than bad here.  I think it is definitely worth the four stars that I gave it, much better than anything they have put out recently.
0736092269|5.0|This is an absolutely ESSENTIAL book on muscle anatomy, for students and practitioners of medicine, and obviously for those in strength training. 600 full color illustrations reveal the primary muscles worked along with all the relevant surrounding structures, including bones, ligaments, tendons, and connective tissue. The book is divided in 7 sections: arms, shoulders, chest, back, legs, buttocks, and abdomen. For every section, several exercises are explained in great detail. Every section also includes the matching stretching (red pages). Injury prevention advice is provided when needed (yellow pages). ALL Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Delavier books are essential, but this has to be the absolutely best of them all. Nobody sells one million copies of a book just because. Highly and strongly recommended!!!<br /><br />Edit 10/14/12: This book would even be better if I contained an index at the end of the book with all the exercises listed and the page they can be found. Also, an introduction would also be appreciated. The book is so straight to the point. As a matter of fact, these two sections lacking here are included in [[ASIN:1450413994 Delavier's Core Training Anatomy]]
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love love love this game as my tittle says its my rave. game its sol additive I just think the coin limit u can get Wylie not on should b a lot more cuz they go quiet fast also the time the walls are up is way too short its over all great since I live very far front a Dave n busters this is great to have hands down the best :)
0143119419|4.0|This is one of the best account of Hedge Fund History starting from A W Jones to modern day greats like Paul Tudor Jones.<br /><br />It carefully explains the various styles, probes the real reasons for success and completes the story : which is often that of Boom to not-so-glory days.<br /><br />If you read carefully, you will get a hang of the trading systems used by the greats. The profiling of the people behind the funds also helps in understanding the human element and not just the Trading strategies. I would have loved to read more on Bruce Kovner though.<br /><br />Towards the end, the book starts to sound like a Lobbyist for Hedge Funds by calling them: small-to-fail vs the big Investment banks which went bust in 2008 crisis. Thats a bit hard to believe.<br /><br />However, I enjoyed reading the book thoroughly. The detailed footnotes shows the diligence in research.<br /><br />A must read for all those who want to understand the people who seem to have More Money Than  God
B008RV5K4U|3.0|The DC animation greatness continues & they've done a marvelous job on adapting Frank Miller's long time celebrated comic book. My only real minor complaints would be that it's broken up into two parts which I thought was sort of pointless not mention having to wait 'till 2013 for part 2. That, & there aren't any interesting special features with this edition. Nevertheless, the stunning animation compliments the brilliant voice cast as does the epic tale in which they've truly made something unique & not just a reproduction of the original graphic novel. While the classic comic has a legendary reputation in the annals of the funny book industry this movie is  quite approachable to non comic readers too. The story is dark, violent, & thankfully the heart of the source material hasn't been watered down in any way. Heck even some of the music score sounds like it's right out of some action crime drama from the late 80's. \\"Batman -Gotham Knight\\" & \\"Green Lantern -1st Flight\\" were my personal favorites of the DC animated movies but \\"Batman -The Dark Knight Returns\\" now owns that spot too.
1118109791|5.0|Helpful book, better than most study materials. Would recommend this to anyone who is interested in preparing for his/her GMAT
B0058W74UY|5.0|i use it to get all my short swf games to play on my kindle. i suggest you get this if you want it to play your games.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Its rare to say the sequel is better, better plot and action. Can't wait for the next in this series.5 stars
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the best book I have read all year. While reading I kept gasping. I would recomend this book to any one loved it.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is an awesome read.....it is well written and so packed with information  that speaks to the world of science. There is so much I could say....but the best advice I can give anyone is to read it for yourself!
B007V2UGPE|2.0|it was okay but ya I think it should have more modes then it does have like free kill or more then just the main story qeust
B000GW8OX2|5.0|This is as amazing as vinyl gets.  It sounds so warm & open.  Organic.  Gone is the ridiculous compression from which RHCP digital forms suffer.  The vinyl is quiet & flawless.  Sweet package but mine does not include gatefold covers as the description states.  There are 4 nice individual LP covers instead.  Records housed in audiophile poly/paper sleeves.  I got a new package for $60, but they are worth the steep prices on the marketplace, trust me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just like playing the same mind numbing game on a computer for hours on end, except on my phone. Like I said, simple fun!
B000929ASW|5.0|The vinyl is far more like what this excellent title is supposed to sound.  It is warm and dynamic vs the digital which is loud, sharp and compressed in comparison.  There is still a tad of sybillance in Adams' vocals at times but nothing compared to the CD.  Most benefiting from the vinyl is the acoustic guitar and swirling steel.  The vinyl is very quiet.  This, along with Heartbreaker, is Adams best work in my opinion.  My only quibble is the cover, unlike that of the CD digipack, is not embossed; that would have been killer sweet!
B000001ZS5|5.0|I first heard this offering in the middle 1980's and fell in love with it.  I almost purchased the vinyl version, but was a bit \\"low in the hold\\" for cash.  I finally was able to purchase this from Amazon, and I still love it.<br />The music itself is fascinating and you can best enjoy it by letting your imagination flow with it.  The sound effects during the gaps between the numbers are, to me, a bit reminiscent of riding the old wooden \\"El\\" trains in Brooklyn as a boy, hearing the different noises as the cars went over switches and sharp curves.  He then puts in a cut of a modern subway in action.  All the music is very well done, even though Jarre throws us a fast-breaking curve ball on the last track.  Still, it's a very well done piece with a very nice Latin rhythm.<br />All in all, this is an album to be enjoyed, and if you're into \\"New Age,\\" then this is for you.  It's a very well done offering and is, indeed, worthy of five stars.
B001641ZZS|5.0|This MoFi made me wonder about the difference between this redbook layer (I don't have SACD playback)& the original 4AD CD I have been used to.  The soundstage is significantly wider.  The drums, most especially, jump out of the speakers.  Maybe too too much?  I can't imagine the original tapes did, but I also doubt they sounded as thin as the original release.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I am no super hero movies fan, but I have to say this movie left me astonished. It will keep you from the beginning to the end entertained and you will have a couple of laughs at least guarantee.<br /><br />About the packaging. I am very satisfied with all the content of this movie, but you'll expect for a combo like this at least a dedicated case for each disk, but no! You get 3D and blu ray ONE OVER THE OTHER one one side and the same for the dvd and digital content at the other side.<br /><br />The movie is 5 stars and the packaging kind of poor (although it looks beautiful from the outside. Hence the -1 Star.
B001A3GSFW|4.0|The Ramones were inovators of punk rock and this almbum, for the most part, captures some of their best work.  It does have a little of their work with Phil Specter that is not their classic style, but overall a great album if you want a nice set of Ramones tunes.  Enjoy.
B007SGM084|5.0|A little more explicit sexually than I prefer, but the storyline is interesting and will keep your attention.  Waiting for next issue, to hear the mans side of the relationship.
1594202842|5.0|I always wondered how Asian parenting, as it is usually thought of, worked. I saw this book mentioned in a Psychology textbook I was studying from for a class. I thought this would be a good book to learn about parenting styles and compare what Ms. Chua had to say against the things I already knew and have experienced. I never expected what I got from reading this.<br /><br />My mother is from Korea (my father from Michigan), and I knew she was more strict than my friend's mothers, but I never took it as being part of her heritage and upbringing. I just thought she was a control freak. I was shocked to see how her standards seemed to match so many of Ms. Chua,s. It was truly eye-opening. So not only was I getting a look into how \\"Chinese mothers\\" think and work, but also how my mother did. There is I lot I don't agree with in this book but a lot that I do agree with as well. I can't wait to use and not use things I've learned from this book in my own life and my family's someday.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested in parenting styles, \\"Chinese mothers\\", or even just a good read. I personally thought it had a very good ending as well.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the best game ever. I could play this game for the rest of my life. But I will die one day and I wouldn't be able to play it.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|Bought the game before checking reviews.  The reviews on this site are spot on.  There is no way to build the requested configurations with the pathetic blocks provided.  More frustration in attempting to build than joy from playing the game.  Fortunately, my 6 year old has a great imagination and just makes the best of it and builds what he can.......
B005LAIH4A|5.0|No issues at all and shipped quicker than expected. Product was as said and I am satisfied with this purchase.
B000HF6XPY|3.0|This would be a favorite movie of mine ever since I was a young girl. I just couldn't find it in the local stores.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I like the book but I think there is too much Jason and not enough Percy who is funnier. Not alot of Annabeth either suprisingly Piper seems to be a more important charecter. Leo did get 10x more funnier than I remember. SPOILER.... the funniest part is where Percy and Frank get stuck in tank and Frank turns into a goldfish. Then Coach Hedge cones and sees them and Frank as a giant goldfish is like 'sup? It's funnier in the book.
B00914JWSW|3.0|i'm a big Streisand fan, i have almost every album she ever put out and i have loved everyone, with one exception. However this CD was a big disappointment ...there was NOTHING NEW,  the meaningless talking before and after some song totally ruined the mood... for the most part the song choices left a lot to be desired...DULL... don't waste your money.... sorry Barbra... :(
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very simple. yet very addictive. great for killing time or just relaxing. for wholesome game that I would recommend to just relax or unwind after long day.
B007THA4FI|2.0|After the delightfully developed characters and the vividly descriptive settings of the Harry Potter epic, I found Casual Vacancy to be flat and lackluster. I did not connect with the characters, nor did I find the story itself to be imaginative.
B007TK77QE|1.0|When I read the town name Pagford I expected a wizard to come round the corner immediately.<br />Echoes of Harry Potter with a lot of gratuitous filthy language. I only persevered to the end because I thought this tortured tribe of mostly loathsome characters had to redeem themselves and the author somewhere along the line. But no, this is NO ADULT BOOK. This is Harry Potter dressing up, on drugs with a potty mouth. Rowlings remains most comfortable with developing the young characters in the book while the so called adults definitely suffer from arrested development. I can see the critics being pretty tentative about taking the richest writer in the world to task but along with Fifty Shades Of Grey this is the second worst novel I have read this year.<br /><br />JK Rowlings has a magic formula with her Harry Potter books. She must stick to her knitting.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Characters I could not even begin getting interested in.  Located in a town that is flat and lackluster.  Rambling plot.  The only characters with depth are the teenagers.  It seems to me the author is best sticking to her comfort zone of adolescents.  Wish I had not bought the book nor wasted my time reading half of it.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the characters but hated the ending.   Can‘t wait to read the second one.      I am looking forward to more.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Bleh. I couldn't finish the book. There was no central hero. I don't know about you but I need a hero to cheer for and a villain to despise (and secretly admire). This book contained neither. It is a snapshot of a town and its residents. This book will probably be turned into a TV show or mini-series. It would be better served as a script than a novel.  So, in summary: Bleh.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love vevo...this is a really good way to watch videos.......a lot better then youtube....it has a lot of old song I haven't heard in a while and that I can enjoy and love! !!!
0316228532|4.0|This is a difficult book to rate.  It reminded me a lot of books by Elizabeth George and/or PD James, with alternating chapters about different characters who all intersect at the end.  It's that type of texture and character development, but without the mystery/detective piece or the characters we love like Lynley and Havers or Dalgliesh.  But it does share that same sense of small town British life, and certainly the characters are interesting and well-developed.<br /><br />So to read this as a work of fiction, of character development, of interweaving personalities and family crises and secrets, it's quite good.  Rowling does have a really good sense of teenagers and their issues, and I thought these characters rang true, although it's a pretty dark view of relationships, families, and marriage for sure.<br /><br />There is nothing magical about this book, and it's hard to believe that it actually was written by the same imagination that spawned the Potter books, but that's okay and it really can't be judged in the same way at all.<br /><br />I do think that the book would have been helped by having a frontpiece with the names of characters and relationships of family members, and perhaps a written map of the areas in question, which we have often seen in books like these.  A cast of characters would certainly have helped you keep track of who was related to whom as you dug into the book.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I read this book, but it didn't change my life.
B004U52VPS|4.0|I had given this gift to my friends 5 yr old boy. I am not familar with angry birds at all so when all she said was angry birds this is the toy that came up!! she says he enjoys it its just a little to young to understand the whole concept. other than that enjoys it!!

0439023513|4.0|I have to admit that I started reading this with a single question at the back of my mind...\\"How is this book possibly going to live up to the first one?\\" While it starts off rather slower than the first book in the trilogy, it picks up pace as you read along. I don't know how it could possibly have been condensed, but I did wish for more interaction between Katniss and the other characters, particularly Gale and Peeta, but I understand that this book is about Katniss coming into her own.<br /><br />As with the previous two novels in the trilogy, this one focuses heavily on Katniss's struggle against being used as a pawn in a game. Suzanne Collins really forces readers to consider the voyeuristic aspects of the Hunger Games, the war that Katniss is raging, and, by extension, our own society's infatuation with \\"reality\\" TV. The story isn't preachy or moralistic, though it is definitely thought-provoking and action-packed.<br /><br />I lied in that I did have one other question...Gale or Peeta? Without giving it away I thought the answer fit perfectly with my view of the characters throughout the series.<br /><br />I can only wonder now how the movies could possibly hope to live up to the books.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|A great read. it can be read at face value but it has many deeper themes going on in it. i agree with someone else said. these books could be easily taught<br />..
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This was an easy read with adventure and a little steaminess. The characters were incredibly similar to the show's, so if you need a fix to get you through to the next episode, pick up a heat novel.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World was a wonderful sequel to Fall of Giants. I wish I didn't have to wait another two years for the third book.

B005LAIHQS|4.0|It's not a fantastic movie, but it isn't bad. It is entertaining but not a super awesome movie. It has it sad moments. 3rd part provides enough information about the characters which we didn't know of. As for younger agent K, the actor was good. So overall it is worth watching but you shouldn't expect too much of it.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|Another shining example of Hollywood attempting to improve on a classic story and falling short. This re-imagined Snow White is a complete failure.<br /><br />Rupert Sanders first venture into feature directing provides viewers with a lackluster trip; more painful than visiting the dentist.<br /><br />Despite a few beautiful locations, the film wasn't even visually stunning.<br /><br />There is nothing within these characters that leads the audience into an emotional investment. If a character dies, one is left with a feeling of \\"I guess they're not going to be in the sequel.\\"<br /><br />Despite a good cast (for the most part), Sanders doesn't bring out their best. The performances are mediocre (with the exception of Stewart). Stewart on the other hand is mediocre in every way on her best days! Her beauty is quite plain; her voice is annoying; her acting style is awful. She was only successful in the Twilight series because her style is exactly as dull as how the character is written. Her performance in Zathura is identical to her performance in Twilight which is identical to her performance in Snow White. Her range is far to limited to carry a movie. Her accent changes throughout the movie, probably due to the filming schedule. It is more of an accent one picks up the longer they are around people with similar accents. Her acquired accent is beyond poor. Most likely due to regional differences in the shooting locations within England, plus Scotland, and adding in Chris Hemsworth natural Australian and Charlize Theron's South African accents. It's a bit of a hodge-podge accent. Stewart's rally cry to incite the people to stand against the queen completely lacks conviction and passion. It's almost as if she's calling out to some from the balcony of her home: \\"brother, don't forget to pick up milk on the way home!\\" It's unbearable!<br /><br />Even my \\"tween\\" who loves Thor, and is a disturbingly huge fan of the Twilight movies, asked if we could turn it off and watch something else; she was that bored!<br /><br />Overall, the final product leads one to believe that the Sanders/Stewart scandal was nothing more than a PR stunt to bring audiences to the theater!something else; she was that bored!<br /><br />Overall, the final product leads one to believe that the Sanders/Stewart scandal was nothing more than a PR stunt to bring audiences to the theater!
B000FA5STS|1.0|The story gets lost among all the emotional situations depicted in the book. Some of the main characters behave unrealistically for their profession.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|First of all this cd need at leat 4 listens before it grows on you. I was i little disappointed with Sonic Boom but this cd is definetely much better. Songs like first single Hell Or Hallelujah, Wall of Sound, Back to the Stone Age, Shout Mercy are fists in you face, heavy rock with thunderous drumming and ferocious guitars. Awesome performance by Tommy Thayer as lead guitarist and i have to say Gene Simmons really deliver 4 classic tracks.  This is the best Kiss album since Revenge.
B008XG1X18|5.0|a friend told about pinterest and I decided to try it. it was everything she had described and I absolutely love it. I can go to so many different places and see beautiful homes and just lose myself for hours. I think this is the cure for a rough day and something to do just because ..have fun .....

B009NPKTN6|1.0|Amazon should give you a refund if you hate a movie within the first 30 minutes.<br />I hated this movie in the first 10 minutes. The lead female has the most annoying<br />voice I have ever heard. I can't listen no mo. And the cinematography is awful!<br />looks like it was shot on 16mm or something. I can see it working on stage as<br />a musical but it doesn't work on the screen. Don't waste your time. Wait till it<br />is free on netflix. Maybe it would be good to watch while vacuuming the rug.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think this is one of the best books I have read.  I would recommend this book to everyone, except for the people that havent read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.  This is a MUST read book.  Go Suzanne Collins
B009CPES4I|4.0|Its always nice to find a good movie that doesn't have to have nudity or foul language to draw people to watch it. A very enjoyable film.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You is a must read if you enjoyed 50 Shades of Grey. There are some similarities such as the billionaire, the beautiful girl and lots of sex. But the story of Bared to You is different, better written and very HOT. This is NOT a BDSM story but there is lots of hot, steamy sex. The story is set in New York City. Gideon is a billionaire and Eva works at an Ad agency located in Gideon's building. Their chemistry is very apparent right from the start and they have a common background that seems to draw them together. The story continues in the second book, Reflected in You, which is just as compelling as Bared to You. I read the second book in 2 days. I can hardly wait until December when the third book, Entwined With You, comes out. I highly recommend this book and series.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The second book in the series is a good read, although it does not capture the excitement and action of the first novel.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|My review is nearly two years late and most everything that can be said about this book has been said, so I will keep mine short.<br /><br />Karen is a master at crafting a vibrant and encompassing story and bringing her words to life and as with most of her novels Shadowfever lived up to the hype. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the book waiting to see what would happen next in Mac's increasingly chaotic world. I was so excited that we would finally have the answers to all of our questions!<br /><br />The pace of the book could drag at times and I found myself shouting get to the point or get to the reveal!!! Most of the big showdowns I was expecting were a bit disappointing and anticlimactic and the ending was a little to cookie cutter for my taste but nonetheless I am happy with how the series concluded.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|great book, execpt it always follows the same plot. they say that they are going on a dangerous mission more dangerous than the last every time. then they complete the mission. this one has a plot twist at the very end thoug
B005XLN97M|5.0|My 6 year old picked this out approx. 6 months ago as the item she wanted to spend her savings and birthday money on. Got it locally after she went up and down all the rows. Dad of course had to set it up, which took about 20 minutes. Once set up it is sturdy and durable. It has held up very well over the past 6 months and it is something my daughter uses regularly. For the large size, it has a relatively low price for a genuine Barbie item. That being said it is mostly just a lot of hard plastic that snaps together. It will likely hold up for her and than be in good enough shape to pass down to other if needed.<br /><br />It has a little kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bath and she loves to play house with it. Overall she thinks she made a good choice and unlike some items she buys only to regret the next day, this one is still a favorite.

There is no one that can equal Michael Jackson and on this particular night at Wembley he was on top of his game.

1616960922|5.0|The Emperor's Soul is set on Sel, the same world as Elantris (but in an empire far away and unrelated to those events.) Shai is a master of the art of Forging - mutating an object's history to change its appearance in the present. However, she's been caught trying to steal the nation's most famous relic, and now she awaits execution... unless she can forge the emperor a new soul in just over three months. An impossible task, but Shai will take any chance she gets.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson is in top form as usual, despite the shortness of this novella. Shai is a thief and has no compunctions about being opportunistic, but her driving force is her pride in her art. She's proud and tenacious - almost to a fault. I wouldn't exactly say she's lovable, but who doesn't love a good noble thief? The supporting characters, with the exception of Gaotona and Emperor Ashravan, don't really have enough time to be developed, but that's understandable for a book less than 170 pages long.<br /><br />I loved the examination of identity in this book. In order for Shai to be such a good Forger, she has to be extremely good at observing both people and objects - the little things that influence them, their motivations, how they can be manipulated. She needs to be able to produce her desired changes with the minimum of effort required for it to appear natural (think about the complexity of planting an idea via a dream in Inception - it's the same concept.) Shai does this instinctively, and it greatly adds to the complexity of the plot and the world building. Of course, she also does it deliberately, and how she pieced together Ashravan's life from notes and interviews is fascinating.<br /><br />I was slightly dissatisfied at the end because it was over too quickly and I wanted more! More of the characters, more plot, more of the world. I can't really complain about that, though - this is a novella, and I knew that going into it, and Sanderson does a great job with it. The only thingthat felt rushed was Shai's task [SPOILER WARNING] - she said it would ordinarily take her two years at least, but she manages to complete it in three months - why was she able to do it so much faster? I would've liked some sort of explanation. [END SPOILERS]<br /><br />I hope Sanderson writes more books featuring Shai and the Empire - perhaps even coming into contact with characters from Elantris.
0316228532|5.0|This was an interesting book. JK Rowling created some in-depth characters and situations, and it was interesting to read how they interacted with and misunderstood each other. The plot and characters were well crafted and came together well at the end. I think JK Rowling has written a perfectly fine book for adults and has proven she knows what she's doing, despite all the readers out there wondering why there's no wizards and why it's not more fun. The Casual Vacancy explores the lives of realistic characters in a confusing and often tragic realistic world. It also raises many questions about what's important and what's not, and how things appear as opposed to how they really are. I read this book because I appreciate JK Rowling and I knew reading something she had written would be worthwhile.<br /><br />  My only major issue with the book was how it changed perspective so often. It would switch from the point of view from one character to the point of view of another character with nothing more than a sentence in between. This made it difficult to read at times, particularly towards the end when all the characters are in the same place and the perspective shifts from person to person all through the chapter. While I thought this was an odd way of doing things, it didn't change the fact that JK Rowling has written a very good, thought-provoking, and ambitious novel.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was one of those books I began to read more slowly as I got near the end because I didn't want it to end. The writing is excellent, brutally honest and inspiring.  I have a feeling I will be reading this book again.

B0000025T6|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's first solo album \\"Nebraska\\", was released in the summer of '82.  After 5 E-Street albums, this was a stripped down affair, performed by Bruce on acoustic and electric guitar and some harmonica.  Bruce was just coming off his mega selling \\"The River\\", in 1980, and some people were not ready for this release.(Even though we get a taste of what was to come on the last 3 cuts of \\"The River\\").  The title track is based on mass murderer Charlie Starkweather, the song is so STARK after all his past hits and album rock tracks.  \\"Atlantic City\\", is a great song, still being heard 30 years later.  \\"Johnny 99\\", brings out some electric guitar, upbeat and bouncy for a song about a guy getting 99 years.  \\"Highway Patrolman\\", a family bond song. \\"Man turns his back on his family, well he just ain't no good\\", great lyric.  \\"State Trooper\\", is a slice of electric-folk, \\"Open All Night\\", is a killer cut, and \\"Reason To Believe\\", gives the album some hope and there's something to live for.  Time for a update of this album.
140053271X|4.0|i have owned 2 different e books and used 4, this is my favorite so far. the touch screen works better than i thought it would and seems scratch resistnant, i prefer it to the ones with buttons because you dont have to push to turn the page. it has a great battery life, i have used mine for 2 months and only charged it twice, and i read for hours on end. the screen has good resolution and is easy to read, even in the sun. my favorite part about this ebook is that it is compatible with multiple software programs, my literati would only accept books from the sponsor website, and i have a whole library already on my computer so this has been a plus.my only complaint is that it sometimes freezes up and needs to be reset, this has happened probably 6 times, it always seems fine after rebooting but it is still annoying, i think it may be because mine was used.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Having read most all Crichton's books, I rate MICRO near the bottom, along with CONGO. Crichton has long been one of my favorite authors, including Conroy, Follett, Tom Wolfe, DeMille, and Irving, et al. Though I enjoyed the substance of the book focusing on the inspection of the incredible world of tiny and microscopic insects and their symbiotic relationship to communicative plants preserving their respective defenses, somehow the book doesn't credibly match up with Crichton's blockbusters, possibly because Crichton, unfortunately, was not able to complete the book. Crichton's untimely death is of great loss to millions of his fans.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|I probably would have given this a five except that I'm not used to it. The perspective has changed somewhat in this cut and the storyline is somewhat more clear than in the \\"conventional\\" cut. I'm not sure I like the \\"cartoon\\" breaks in the action. Essentially, everything is the same and even though the cut difference is explained in the bonus features, I'm not sure I understand the motivation. It is still an enjoyable movie. I especially like the Coney Island scenes, being an old Brooklyn boy. The movie drifts in and out conflicts with surrealistic gangs. The leader of the protagonist gang has has become a classic icon. The actor does a marvelous job portraying a sociopathic gang leader on the edge of psychotic behaviors.<br />I would recommend reading the Sol Hurok book prior to seeing the movie. The DVD is of good quality. It came on time. The price was right and it, for me, reaffirms Amazon's quality as a retailer.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|I have rarely and mean RARELY have ever felt compelled to write a personal view on a film. I am a great fan of really good scifi...this is not it. I own all the major dvds on the major Alien franchise...personally saw ALIENS two times at my theater...when the BIG SCREEN meant that; not those over sized projection screens we are all now subjected to. Those were all awesome films...personally the first two Alien and Aliens kicked, the last two were mediocre at best but workable and had a story line. (also loved Gladiator and own that too; Sir Ridley Scott shined). I am personally surprised this film ever received above a one star rating by any objective critic. It SUCKED..sorry for the venacular.<br /><br />DON'T READ BEYOND THIS SINCE IT INVOLVES SPOILERS....OR LACK OF THEM.  This story starts with the alleged human god or human ancestor with a spaceship coming down, perhaps after him and then basically he takes some suicide drink, falls off the cliff into water and is dissolved, with DNA strands disbanding in the water he fell into and the spaceship leaves...no explanation what any of that meant..(even later we don't know ever)...Later in the film we discover this weird DNA match to these massive humans or this particular human is brought up to show our possible lineage to them (i am guessing but nothing is every later confirmed anyway). Later this human/ancestor wants to go to earth to destroy earth. (Ending of the film is the other heroes and captain of the expeditions ship destroys the first ship ((the one containing the human/ancestor giant now fighting a large squid type alien)) and inbetween all that are good actors with no script to work with and having multiple different FRAGMENTS of individual stories that in the end never become cohesive. No one can like or have any personal bond to any of the characters because there are too many, plastic, one dimensional characters and too many individual elements that never largely meet anywhere. But on with the story beginning,our expedition ship arrives. No Aliens actually transpire (except the one the ancestor/human fights at the end of picture) but the story alludes (sort of) that these vases found in the caves they explored were aka alien pods. (Yes they went many times to caves and opened up several doors and saw holographs of our alleged alien/ancestors running around the caves and which we chased after them...again nothing is resolved for sure with that or \\"explained\\" ). Two crew members who chose to leave early run into some snake like creature and begin to tease/annoy it...(strange behavior for anyone, escpecially scientists to teast an unknown alien life form not knowing what it's capable of). These were the same bozos who just earlier became frightened of the holographs and chose to leave the cave expedition party to head back to the home ship.  But now later seeing this snake creature, they almost annoy and aggitate it...to their demise. (ONlY Hollyweird can write such inconsistent BS). Later it is suggested or inferred that this anomoly/area was a product of the military (aliens for biotech warfare is alluded to) and a greedy company to make money who have no moral compass helped in the construction of something...again they constructed what??? We never are told! (geeze does this sound new??) But they sent this party to this rock/planet anyway. David the robot/cyborg is evil then turns kind of good but job is to protects his architect who is this old man who funded this operation. He appeared as a holograph at the beginning of the film and was to be dead long before the crew arrived on this rock/planet and before the major crew was defreezed for the expedition...but lo and behold he is alive (towards the end of the film) and with all the greedy company (motives) and military weapon testing (motives to create something and not sure what???) alluded to throughout the film, the first story line now changes completely and it was REALLY about the old guy (the one fundingthe expedition)who was looking to avoid death...His fountain of youth he was hoping would be found in the alien ship...Of course that never happened and he and the robot/cyborg David are killed...(well David the robot is decapitated but alive and can speak....geeezze now isn't this new) and the alleged heroine (who got impregnaged by her briefly exposed boyfriend to an \\"alien\\" microbe)had this weird thing removed from her stomach...that later (towards end of filme)grew and killed the alleged ancestor/father to the human race who also wanted to destory earth(and we still don't know why). Now he (David the robot/cyborg missing his body from his head wants to help her (the heroine of our story...sort of) after she successfully runs from the ship and the evil human god/ancestor now fighting an alleged alien that came from her stomach that grew. This alleged protype alien that looks like a squid (truly national geo has a more frightening large squid photoed than this) and kills this alleged human ancestor/god with some weird tongue going down our alleged ancestor/alien throat that gives birth to a chest explosion with a brief 3 sec view of some creature coming out of the human/ancestor's chest. Now David the now NICE robot/cyborg will take her (our heroine) elsehwere to find the answers to all of this....THE END......I truly wish I were joking but that is it (largely) in a nutshell...I DEMAND my whopping $5 I paid for watching on \\"demand\\" tv.  Horrible, horrible film and yes Sir Ridley Scott should bow his head in shame to have his name associated with this monstrosity. (as far as these 5 or 4 points stars given; my ONLY explanation is they didn't WATCH the film or they are friends or relatives to the performers, director with a personal issue to hold).<br /><br />OK now for the good points:  (crickets..the sound of silence hmmmmmmmmmmm)  Ok Ridley Scotts name; good actors (with a limited script); hype and good special effects...truly THE END! (STILL WANT MY $5 REFUND....ON PRINCIPAL)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003T0G9XU|5.0|I am a biased fan of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels but have definite preferences & therefore high expectations of certain stories.<br />This has exceeded my expectations, again :^D<br />Two of Terry's characters at their very best.<br />Thank you again Mr Pratchett.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I must admit I was disturbed to learn I am doing some of the things described in this book. Yet the information on Alzheimer's disease was good to know, and presented in a non-lecturing voice. Mostly I think this is a relationship story; how would any of us react if someone we care about is diagnosed with such a disease, including ourselves? Good to think about and discuss.

0316228532|4.0|I became really invested in the characters and story.  This book gets one of my highest accolades - it seems plausible.  The characters are interesting and complex but are completely human.<br />I would recommend this to people who like Trollope.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was a waste of my money & such a disappointment.  I was so excited to get it because I loved Harry Potter, but unless she changes a lot I will not buy another one without reading some first. The book was nothing but sadness, gossip, tragedy, & more sadness. Color it black. To me, there was no mystery, no suspense, no real direction.  The characters had no redeaming values.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Finally an app for my greatest addiction.  in my opinion this is one of the only apps that is better for Kindle than the ipad alternative.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book is a portrail of real life in society. It is a very graffic account of what goes on in peoples lives, and how lives all intertwine, in one way or another.I would say that it is not a book that should be read by anyone under the age of 16 at least.
B0012HQKZE|5.0|Please read after you have seen the movie!  I have to watch this movie every year.  I also have the soundtrack which puts me into the plot and subplots again.  This is an outstanding movie, very thought provoking. Big plusses for the movie include the scenery coinciding with the score by Jerry Goldsmith (Aliens, Gremlins, Hoosiers, Air Force One, The Ghost and the Darkness), and there is the entire cast, and Hopkins and Baldwin, the Mamet script, and the directing adding to the quality.  The story alone keeps your focus throughout the movie.  There is physical danger with the freezing weather, the bear, no food, no transportation, no communication for rescue, no shelter, no weapons, no map, no real compass, plus their own panic and sense of shame, and add to all those problems the intrigue of each character's motive. These men would have not interacted this way had there been a woman around.  It is about the relationship among the men in a supercharged situation. The action scenes are realistic, especially the plane crash, and the scene when the bear is about to \\"eat\\" Bob and Charles.  I believe this is Alec's best acting.  And Hopkins is, well, the best as the understated, defensive, clumsy, and sometimes inept and sometimes shy Charles.<br />  Yes, Charles is gracious and kind, even courteous, with his last line in the movie.  But - I read somewhere that Charles's last line had another meaning.  I always thought there was something deeper, something I missed somehow.  Eventually Charles would have discovered his wife's infidelity, she would have gotten her prenup settlement, and he would have had to seek another trophy wife, or remain alone. Their deaths \\"saved his life\\" from his phony marriage and his paranoid and stiff, \\"jaded\\" life. Everyone wanted something from his wallet or to get his wife.  The lodge owner wanted some of his millions to build a resort.  Charles had even suspected the innocent jet mechanic for wanting to get a hold of \\"her\\" - Charles meaningwife, the mechanic meaning the Challenger Jet.  Bob was jealous and made fun of Charles. Bob also nearly gave him a very real heart attack with the bear skin at his birthday party. One also has to realize the raw animal grip Charles got on his core survival instincts which caused him to drive Bob backwards to fall into the deadfall.  And yet he rescues Bob because he has dropped all guards and is at heart a kindly person, longing for real love and capable of giving love.  There is sympathy for Charles because his wife was the only woman he ever wanted, and he truly loved her.  He demonstrates his love for the now pitiful Bob, who realizes he's done nothing in his life that leaves any legacy.<br />With this ordeal Charles has done something in his life that was \\"unequivocal\\" - his lifelong want.  He has become a better man, who \\"may not return\\" to his prior life, determined to change his life, having been rescued by his own vast theoretical knowledge and coolness to face each deadly situation calmly and wisely.  Without any physical training or skills, he drew from his thinking and became a uniter, a placator, a fighter, hunter, and leader to become much richer than all his billions.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|No one makes you think and laugh in equal measure quite like Pratchett and Gaiman. And here they are, on the same menu. Characters? Delectable. Plot? Chewy, flavorful, long-lasting - like bacon. Bacon that's Good for You.<br /><br />Our meal? The Antichrist is a bun in the oven, for starters. But there's a mix-up in the kitchen, and he's switched at birth - into sushi. His little sushi boat floats right by his intended parents on the way to... the battle between Nature and Nurture, and The Apocalypse. (Ahem: This is NOT how it happens, so read the book. Also read the book to learn why I'm dying for a \\"Wasabi.\\" Hint: It may be too late to die young, but it's never too late to die quick!)<br /><br />Some reviewers were disappointed in the dessert. I thought it was perfect.<br /><br />(Just one thing: The authors get that Females are People, too, and even seem to Like and Understand us. Only a nit-picky, star-withholding ingrate would ask them, 22 years late: \\"If angels are `mostly sexless' but you made them all male, anyway... couldn't you have let us stake our claim on (or in) the Tooth Fairy - who has, sadly, been reduced to an `it'?\\" So I won't ask.)

1451629192|5.0|This book was the nest book I have ever read, not necessarily the best book because it was written so well, but because you want the character in the book to be okay and to come home to her family where she belongs. I love how strong Jaycee stays throughout the book. it almost makes you want to put yourself in her shoes and wonder if you could ever be as strong as she was throughout all the mental and physical pain she experienced. Everything in this book makes you realize just how lucky you are. i recommend this amazing book to anyone and everyone. This book does not just relate to women, it relates to everyone. I think every young girl especially should read it to see how careful you have to be, and how lucky they really are.  I could not seem to put the book down and ended up finishing it in one day.

B005LAIHY0|1.0|My title essentially summarizes this movie. The science in this movie is preposterous. Obviously caucasian alien that looks like a marble Greek God performs hari kari to seed his DNA on earth. Problem is DNA starts disintegrating right in front of our eyes, what are the odds that reforms into a living cell (let alone a being as complex as a human) in 30,000 yrs (using their timeline)? Billion to one.<br />Behaviour of scientists? Even my eleven yr old kid laughed when they broke off from the group.<br />The gestation of the alien was nonsensical. It's scientifically impossible, doesn't Hollywood consult real scientists anymore despite these multimillion budgets? The c-section scene was hilarious medicine, they spray antiseptic and call it anesthesia while patient is fully awake? Patient walks out of surgery and accompanies mission?<br />Alien that supposedly spawned us turns out to be a nasty piece of work.<br />This is atheism proseletysing in it's worst form and it wasn't even entertaining.

B002SSUQFG|2.0|I bought this watch to replace a Seiko quartz analog watch that ran for about seven years. The watch worked well at first but it doesn't hold up like the previous Seiko...which had all the same features. I used it daily for about a seven or eight months before having problems. This watch doesn't handle any kind of impact very well so be careful. If you're active like I am, your watch sometimes takes a hit. After that, it wasn't ever the same and ended up having problems. The deal breaker was the day it randomly gained 35 minutes...I reset it and let it run on the night stand for five or six hours, and sure enough it was 35 minutes fast. This watch doesn't cost too much so it doesn't pay to fix it. It didn't meet my basic expectations and its not very resilient.
0545323126|4.0|The series of books is an easy and good read for young teenagers.  They are a fun way of getting uninterested readers to read.  Most teenagers can relate to the story and enjoy the humor.
B007HJ84ZK|4.0|I really liked this first episode.  I've read the book and I feel they really captured each characters look, and personality.  Some things were left out, but I think that's the case with any book that becomes a film or tv show.  I would recommend reading the books as well as watching the show.  Then you won't miss anything.  Sometimes there were detail that were so tiny in the show, you wouldn't understand their meaning unless you read the book.  All in all, great first episode.  I'm so glad they turned this into a show.
B005RDF2RG|5.0|Shrek is a great movie for children, as well as, adults.  I would recommend it to anyone.  There is a lot of adult humor mixed in to make it fun for everyone!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I still have a few questions... does it have the diamonds n does it collect meat n differt stuff when u distroy it? also r there creepers... zombies... n spiders? cause I really want them in the game but if there not then I have to announce tht this is not the full version the one in the app store from apple is I'm am srry if it doesn't have ty stuff n to the people tht wanted but already got it.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I've been a student of the bible for over 20 years and have used many translations. This one is clear, up to date and yet remains true to the original manuscripts. Love it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|omg so addictive I can not stop playing! love it!!!! my husband don't understand what makes it so addictive lol
B007TK77QE|3.0|To tell the truth I was a little disappointed. The characters don't seem real to me and the story just rambles on without really generating any interest in how it will finish. I like my stories to make me want to read as quickly as poosible.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great game that makes your brain think! You should try it! You will love it! this game rocks!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|As a more  mature reader I was initially skeptical about whether this book was for me.  I am not a sucker for a romance or easily blinded by a hard luck story but found this book intriguing.  The author cleverly pulled me in with mystery and engagement to the point  that I could not help but keep reading.  The characters are  real and the subject matter engrossing.  This book  took me to a place I have never been and helped me understand a life experience in a way that I have never done.  This, for me is what great writing is all about.
B00957T6X6|5.0|From page one, the reader is trapped & intrigued in a multi plotted novel full of unexpected twists & turns by equally endearing,& not so, characters.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This book was interesting.  The characters were smart and very into school.  But, they had some strange personal issues. All in all it was an ok read.
B009B53LA6|5.0|After 11 years this is a great reminder of how much fun No Doubt's music is.  Great listen from beginning to end.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|It was nice to read a book that makes you feel good.  It was funny and uplifting.  I enjoyed it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Before you start reading any King novel you wonder if it will be able to top the one you love the most, then next thing you know, your halfway through it and missing large chunks of time. Ive often cited past King novels as my favorites, and this one has easily been added to that long list.
1586487981|5.0|The most amazing book I've ever read about the way to fight poverty around the world!!! It uses a wide range of examples to easily explain the most important topics around poverty such as education, health, food (hunger), work, housing and so on. This book also inspired me to develop an educational project that won a social entrepreneurship contest and that is in implementation process! thanks to Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo. I strongly recommend it.
B008I3R2VG|4.0|Very good album - better than most music currently being released. Compared to other Killers albums, this is not my favorite, but it has several outstanding songs. The deluxe version is worth it just for the song Carry Me Home. Overall, it was worth buying.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Halcyon is Ellie Goulding's 2nd album, following her debut with the 'Lights' album, and it is amazing. If I had to pick a song that was my least favorite, I couldn't tell you. I mean, there are tracks like Figure 8, Hanging On, and Atlantis that really stand out with their beats. That doesn't mean that her other tracks are bad, but just the opposite. I enjoyed the bonus track with Calvin Harris, and the inclusion of her debut single of Lights was a nice touch. It reminds fans of where she started. Overall, there is nothing negative that I can say about this album. Here is to the hope that Ellie Goulding continues with her successful career.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was a big fan of her other books but casual vacancy did not come close to being a good and entertaining story.  Personally, I found it boring and too drawn out to be entertaining.
B007THA4FI|3.0|A large amount of characters were inroduced close to the onset of the book, with more coming forward as the book progressed.  It was difficult to keep these people straight and I had to keep going back to earlier parts to be able to place them.  It was also hard to like anyone in the book except for the Social Worker and the teen-agers, Krystal and Andrew, so the ending, while very realistic, was very disappointing.
B00943SQCI|5.0|This was a great movie! It had all kinds of elements to it. It was funny yet serious, was a bit dark (he's a vampire and obviously has to eat), but yet comical, and of course, the last component, there's a love triangle. Without giving too much away, I'd say you can't go wrong watching this alone, as a couple, or as a family with children. Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is super addicting and fun. its great for passing time and their is so many great games. games for your whole family.
B009GEELDS|5.0|Excellent quality in audio and video. Love the Castle episodes. Have all episodes in the AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO on my ROKU.
B002QKZLZ6|1.0|product pictures show case with a belt clip. no such to be found! wasted time to returned it and wait for it! avoid!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|have been playing this game for months now, was going good, a few glitches here and there, but all in all enjoyable. then a couple weeks ago over half my businesses and all my houses, farm plots, about a 3rd of my town disappeared. I submitted a complaint, but nothing has happened. I've noticed quite a few people have had the same problem and no help from the designers. don't get this game unless u want to waste ur time.
B0090EIILU|1.0|Obvious stereotypes without any true wit.  Low brow terribly predictable and an utter waste of time.  If you like dumb humor you might get a chuckle here and there, but you'll probably just end up hating yourself for making such a bad choice to watch this.<br /><br />Awful, just awful.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I must admit, I am not a \\"Trekkie.\\" I never really got into the TV show or the other movies, but I watched this on the recommendation of a friend. She said it sort of takes place in an alternate universe so it wouldn't matter that I hadn't seen all of the shows or whatnot, I would still \\"get it.\\" Well, I did - and I have to say that I absolutely LOVED this movie! The casting was perfect and the story, special Fx and everything were all just spot-on! I would recommend this movie to anyone!
B0090EIILU|1.0|Definitely would NOT recommend.  The Dictator was funny in parts but went beyond funny and well into stupid.  I couldn't wait for it to end - good thing I only rented this one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this book will leave u guessing. once u think u have figured  the story all out,it takes an unexpected turn. loved it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|she plays it all the time on her kindle fire and DROID RAZR.  Reminds her of the old quarter pushers
034580404X|4.0|I liked the storyline. It's like reading a grownup version of Cinderella. Book one is a little slow at first, but then you start to get into the story and characters. Book two is my favorite. Very entertaining! It has the perfect combination of romance, drama, and eroticism. Book three is a disappointment though. No mystery, incredibly predictable, and uneventful in my opinion. Overall I did enjoy the series and discovering the mysterious behind Grey.
B007TK77QE|5.0|As I never read Harry Potter I cannot compare this book to the best selling series.<br />The story is compelling, the characters complex and real and the flow of events builds tension in a way which doesn't allow the reader to put the book down.<br />Well done, J.K. and I hope that we don't have to wait too long before your next adult book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the storyline and character development in book two. It kept me wanting to keep reading more. I never wanted to put the book down.
B005C5A6C0|2.0|I must begin this review by pointing out that I am a big Machine Head fan, and have been since Burn My Eyes came out in '94. I have most of their albums,and I've seen them live so many times I've lost count. I preordered the deluxe edition of this with the dvd, so I think it's fair to say I genuinely wanted to, and intended to, like this album a lot. Unfortunately, I did not.<br />The album begins with about a minute of the vocalist droning two words over and over(Someday sunny someday sunny someday sunny etc..) It's truly annoying even on the first listen; on subsequent listens it's unbearable, but it's part of the first track so you can't skip it(if you look up the track on Youtube, that intro is cut off it). After listening to the album twice, I had to edit that out myself to ever listen to the song/album again. It's a truly terrible way to start an album, and I really wondered what they were thinking.<br />Unfortunately the rest of the album told me what they were thinking - they were going to do whatever it took to pad out the songs and make them as long as possible. The songs on here are just too long, and they get boring fast. Make no mistake, I like long songs when done properly. I'm a big fan of Opeth and Justice is my favourite Metallica album. But these songs on this album are just one riff after another with no real dynamics or purpose. Just piling riffs on top of each other just to make the songs long. I find my mind wandering off really fast, and having to force myself to listen to the songs. And I'll be honest - a really good riff or melody will show up once in awhile and grab my attention - and then the next riff comes along and it doesn't fit, and the song goes nowhere, yet keeps on going.<br />I read a Machine Head interview where one of the bandmembers stated that they don't deliberately set out to make 10 minute songs, they just do what feels right for the song. When you listen to this album you can tell that's totally untrue. They deliberately made the songs long for the sake of long, and ruined them. There are some really good ideas in this album, buried underneath the musical clutter, but they are overshadowed by the way everything drags on.<br />If this were an album of 5 minute songs, concentrating on the best ideas and building songs around them instead of trying to turn everything into an epic, it would be a good album. I bet someone out there could edit this into some really good 4 or 5 minute songs(there are fan edits of movies, so why not albums?) It occurred to me that Machine Head is trying to write And Justice For All when they'd be better suited to writing the Black Album. Shorter songs that are more to the point. More groove, more crush, less attempt at dynamics.<br />It has been a year and I don't listen to this album at all. I put it in once at about 11 months, and it just truly bored me. This does not stand up to their other works.
1616960922|4.0|This book is a great read and will entertain you. Brandon has a way of story telling that brings the pages to life, and this novella is no exception. Great writing, great story. For being as short as it is, the plot and characters all flow very well.<br /><br />I give the book 4/5 stars because I know what Brandon Sanderson is capable of as a writer. Is this his best work? Certainly not... but it is a great piece of literature nonetheless.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|There are a lot of work outs for pregnant women out there. I have tried many and most of them treat us like if we sweat or exert ourselves we are breaking the rules.  I have heard some one describe labor as running a marathon without actually running. Having done it a couple times, I agree completely. I needed to be active. I got this video on Netflix my last pregnancy and thought this time I would just buy it. The instructor is fantastic and actually very pregnant. I found her funny and thought she pushed at just the right moment. Love it!
B008LZHA3G|3.0|It was just OK.  I was a little disappointed, and I love Dylan.  Only in two of the pieces did I 'sit up and take notice'; otherwise I kind of would never play this CD again.  Sorry Bob.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved Wool!  Original and captivating.  I hope this author continues to write about this world because the possibilities are endless.  I could not put it down and yet wanted to savor the book so it wouldn't end. I highly recommend.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|I love Enigma.  This album just droans on and seems like made up of pieces from the cutting floor.  I really was disappointed indeed as Engima is Such a Great Group.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am a Harry Potter fan, and while I knew this would be a big departure, I wasn't expecting this. I kept getting characters confused because of their similar names and lack of connection developed between reader and character. Every time I read the book, I just felt sick, but I had to get through it. It was very upsetting because I could easily see it all happening in the real world. Overall, I just wasn't happy reading this. It took me to uncomfortable places I didn't want to go, and now I'd be concerned about reading anything else she puts out. I'll stick with Hogwarts.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|This Enigma album was a surprise of their great sounds played out in a sultry album.  The whole album was superb and truly one of their best I think.  I was pleasantly surprised how they can keep knocking out mystery moods that hold one's attention.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  It's happy and sad and shows the loyalty of Dogs.  I would recommend this movie for everyone to watch,,, although children 12 and under should watch with their family because it would make any one cry.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have read Flynn's novels in order they were published (I read them all in the last week or so).  My favorite of the bunch was Sharp Objects because it was so twisted.  Gone Girl is pretty twisted as well.  The book starts out slow but steady and gets more gripping until finally the ending hits a crescendo like the symbols smashing together at the end of Hitchcock's Man Who Knew To Much. I think Alfred would have made a terrific movie out of this.  At some  point in the book, even the term \\"MacGuffin\\" was used, a word coined to describe a Hitchcock plot device.  Did I love the ending?  No, but I would categorize Flynn's novels in the horror genre and the ending is horrifying.  You aren't always going to get satisfaction or a feeling of justice served.  Some of the one star reviews say they were going to give it 4 stars until the ending.  I think if you can make that many people upset by the ending then you have done a job well done.  I recommend this book.  It is fun, frightening and nobody does dysfunctional relationships like Flynn does.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is so good a bit like Sims freeplay but a lot better could do with more energy it runs out to quickly
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I'm a recent discoverer of Jack Reacher novels -- having discovered them just before Summer.  But having just read the entire series to date and within the past 120 days or so they're all fresh in my mind.  Based on that I have to say that I really enjoyed this latest and frankly thought that it was easily one of the best in the whole series.  One thing in particular that was appreciated is that there seemed to be less predictability -- for example, with some of the other books in the series you had a pretty good idea what would happen next with regard to either fight scenes or love interests (Jack wins, and Jack gets the lady).  I found this one to be a bit better at leading us in a given direction, but then you might or might not end up where you thought you'd be.  So I was quite pleased with this one and now unfortunately join the ranks of those who wait out that long gap between books!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|We enjoyed this as a family. Captivating and very creative. Give it a go, you will enjoy it if you watch it with an open mind.<br />I would recommend seeing this at least once. Exceptional FX
B008XG1X18|5.0|like the app . works well with my kindle fire. very easy to navigate, works better than the browser version.
B007YA5NRO|5.0|This was more helpful to me than the Fuji manual.  Plus, I was able to download it to my Kindle app.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app used to rock. downloaded tons of music and even movies now you cant even watch them let alone download. don't waste your storage
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Full of imagery, detail, and the story line is great!  It is compelling to read from chapter to chapter and find out what will happen next.  I also like the way each chapter has a character focus.
B007KDFWRG|2.0|What a disappointment this CD was.  Firstly, as noted by others, the sound quality is Horrible.  There is simply no excuse for releasing material this poorly recorded.  Call it what you will--muddy,dull,etc. it simply was hard to listen to--especially with good headphones.  The material itself--in sound and composition,  is second rate compared to their CD's.  I was hoping that they would utilize the great soulful voice of Mike Mattison more--but alas, no.  I'm still waiting for a double CD that combines the best of the old Trucks band with the new one.  It simply is a waste to use Mike Mattison's voice almost solely for back up. I would jump at the chance to see them live--but suggest passing on this offer.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|Yes, as one of the songs goes, I still quite like some of their early stuff, but this record is absolutely stuck in my head in a great way.  The last few efforts from Neil and Chris were uneven, had just one or two songs that I wanted to hear again.  This offering has many songs that are clever, compelling, and catchy.  Neil's vocals have improved somehow, seem surer and smoother.  I don't know that they've \\"grown\\" on this album so much as gone back to what works for them.  I had hopes of at least one more great album and the Boys have delivered.  Chris has given us something more lush and layered again, walked away from the minimalism that hindered some of the last records.  The one song that doesn't work for me is Winner which I am guessing was a commercial gesture to work into the London Olympics.  Regardless, the Pet Shop Boys are one of Britain's greatest living treasures.  How lucky we are.
034580404X|1.0|I downloaded the first book on to my Kindle. I'm not a high brow intellect but I was aghast at the low standard of writing,plot/story and content of this book that is supposed to have sold millions of copies worldwide. I was repeatedly asking myself \\"What level have we readers descended to, in order to get a thrill or buzz or whatever it is people are looking for, when they read this thrash??\\" There really is NO accounting for people's taste!<br />I would forgive them for buying or borrowing the first book as,Mea culpa , I did out of curiosity..BUT to actually to go to the trouble of buying and reading Book 2 AND 3...the mind boggles!!Book one is the biggest load of tripe,trash rubbish I ever forced myself to read. I honestly could not go past the 60th page ,which took me a torturous 2 weeks. By then it was too late to claim my money back from Amazon!!I'm not a prude. I love a little bit of \\"slap and tickle\\" in books (I even read \\"The sensuous Woman\\" back in the 70's plus many more sexually explicit reads since then), but as we say in Ireland , This beats Banagher.. in other words , this is the limit and I cringe at the thought that our taste in books (Note, I do not say Literature)has deteriorated to this low level. Too late for me to say \\"Don't bother buying\\" as I know millions have already done so. What a tragedy. My heart goes out to the next generation if this is the example their parents are setting them!Ladies get a life!
1439156816|5.0|As an up and coming writer myself this book is doing amazing things for me and I am only halfway done. Yeah it includes the typical writing advice like many books on writing but I really enjoy Mr. Kings personal thoughts, the back stories that made him into who he is today with regards to his life and family and his own harsh realities of the writing world. Since he his one of the greatest american writers of the last 50 years his personal stories make him feel like a normal person with normal issues giving his advice and wisdom more credibility in my mind. As a new writer his brutal honesty with regards to writing and life is really sticking with me.<br /><br />Michael Melville<br />(author of Running Northwest)
B008QE9XD2|2.0|Let me start right off the bat by saying that I am a die hard fan of Tim Burton. I will see anything and everything the man does. I think he's a genius. However, even geniuses can have those moments where they aren't knocking it out of the park. 'Dark Shadows' is one of those moments. It has all the right ingredients, but isn't fully stirred to a wonderful brew.<br /><br />Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is turned into a vampire, cursed by the witch Angelique (Eva Green), and buried. Centuries later, Barnabas is dug up in 1972. Upon returning to his home, Collinwood, he meets the latest Collins family descendants, headed by Michelle Pfeiffer. Barnabas then sets out to return his family, home, and family business to it's former glory, but witch Angelique once again raises her head to cause problems.<br /><br />I never saw the original 'Dark Shadows' TV series or movies, so there is nothing I can say about that and I can't compare. Tim Burton is certainly brilliant when it comes to style and flare, but his recent output has all been just that - style and flare. That's 'Dark Shadows'. It also doesn't help any that the movie has the same cold detachment that his previous movie, \\"Alice In Wonderland\\", suffered from. Burton has no problem putting together a stellar cast who seem to want to rise to the occassion, but the movie doesn't rise to their level. Depp is fantastic, of course, with a great, classic look. He sparkles in his scenes. The supporting cast of Pfeiffer, Green, Jackie Earle Haley, Chloe Grace Moretz, Helena Bonham Carter, and Christopher Lee, all do their best, but they are in a movie that mostly slumps along not realizing the dazzling people it has to work with. Style-wise, the movie is wonderful, of course. It has some great cinematography, production design, and striking visuals. Sometimes, in some movies, that's enough. But it's not here. Burton can do better.<br /><br />'Dark Shadows' isn't a bad movie by any means. It's certainly watchable, and even enjoyable and entertaining in parts, but it doesn't feel like all the parts are there. That the filmmakers settled for middle of the road. The potential is there in abundance, but no one took too much interest. The final climax is rousing, to be sure, but it felt too quick and not exploited to the the crazy, over the topness that it could of been. A \\"Death Becomes Her\\" sort of thing, especially with the character of Angelique. That's the feeling throughout the whole movie. That feeling of 'What could of been'.<br /><br />In the end, 'Dark Shadows' is a mixed bag and a lost opportunity. I used to like seeing Tim Burton do his spin of well known, existing properties, but enough is enough. I am really eager for Tim to go back and do something original. Give us the next 'Beetlejuice', the next 'Edward Scissorhands'. Hopefully, the recent \\"Frankenweenie\\" returns Tim to his former glory. But this one? It's basically a \\"Well, it looked good\\" kind of a movie.
B008KOMMTA|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever made.  But to see it in 3D is beyond anything I expected.  In the hands of James Cameron, this is 3D at its best.<br />Does not seem possible it is a conversion.  It looks like it was made in 3D.  If you have a 3D TV.  Titanic is a MUST MUST MUST. I promise you,<br />you will be so happy you did.  This is a in 3D is a movie to own  and savor for many years to come.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun little game.  not a lot to think about and the best strategy is still at the mercy of the drop of a coin.  i wish it had a better physics engine for the coins and gravity though as it seems to only go off of proximity
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This just goes on and on, like the first book. Poor writing and weak dialogue. Eking out bits of Gray's past is supposed to make us like him better? A silly fantasy. I guess I keep reading this in the hopes that it gets better.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was reccomended to me for an interesting insight into a near death experience. what an amazing person this lady is very very open and honest.<br />her story would interest a wide group of people who seek answers in life.<br />People i know are interested in getting this book so i hope they enjoy it as much as i did.<br />  Amazon .Com.

B000T1GKH2|5.0|Ian Anderson is and continues to be one of the most prolific song writters to come from across the Pond. Having seen Jethro Tull 6 times in the days of my youth I was always drawn to the Lyrics and the awesome continuing thread through the songs, the incredible guitar playing of Martin Barre. When I was young I didn't catch it for I was so moved by the songs and the ever so entertaining Ian and his flute when one day while listing to the song \\"Aqualung\\" I noticed the hard rock sound of Martins guitar work. Thick as a Brick stands on its own as album created by musical genius. I haven't had a listen to Thick as a Brick two released not too long ago for the very reason of this \\"If its not broke do not fix it.\\" And I found it hard to believe all these years later to add to one of this most incredible works that to me stood alone in the Huge awesome body of work that was and is Jethro Tull. Having seen the bands transitions through the years from the rocking sounds of Auqualung to the more acousticly driven \\"Too Old to Rock and Roll Too Young to Die\\" or \\"Songs from the Wood\\" the rising to more Rock in \\"The Crest of a Knave.\\" I cannot get into Ian's head but he saw something and in the ever changing pace of the music they that is \\"Jethro Tull\\" were writing. A few years back I saw in a concert \\"Ian Anderson does Jethro Tull Orchestral.\\" Incredibally good yet it was not the boys. Ok back to Thick as a Brick..........Buy it, listen to it. You if your in any way a Tull fan will B BLOWN away, Peace.......
B005LAIHPY|2.0|Pretty bad. Seemed like I was watching a poor remake of Transformers. Same sound effects I think. The video was pretty stunning. The story lame, old and tired. Funny lines at times. Very disappointing overall. With Peter Berg you either get insanely awesome like \\"The Kingdom\\" & \\"Very Bad Things\\" or you get this. Not worth a view.

B005KA188S|4.0|Wow, Colin Farrell nailed it! What an awesome villan he makes. We really enjoyed this. I loved the comedy mixed in too. This was actually a horror flick done well and with some comedy thrown in (hello it's McLovin) that did not detract from the horror. Great Job!

I was unable to really watch it and keep focus on it because the charachters would either be so loud that I would have to turnthe volume down on my TV or it would suddenly be so quiet that I found myself tuning the volume up nearly full capacity.  This was not once or twice.  This was constant!  And very annoying!  A waste of my money and a waste of what really looked to be a good film because I won't attempt to play it again!  Somebody messed up bad here!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Just beyond amazing! Amazing characters, great story line, and beautiful writing. Always a surprise waiting to unfold as you read.
B008XOXGCO|5.0|This album is the first CD I've ever bought.<br />The Script's songs fit me so well.<br />Except some bad words, which are no matter to me, I consider this album is awesome.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I suppose if you watch soap operas this book might be a good read.  I guess if you have the IQ of 50 or no brain cells, it might be a good book.  I had to force myself to read up to page 100 and that is when I decided it would make better toilet paper.  None of the reviews that give a 5 star give any substance in their review to state why it deserves 5 stars.  Perhaps they don't want to admit they are into S&M, I really don't know.  This book is an insult to women.

B009OYTIXS|4.0|I'm usually disappointed in a television series after the first half-hour. Not so with Arrow. The entire show held my interest, and I'm looking forward to the next episode. Hopefully I won't be disappointed!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I really wasn't happy with this movie, it was slow and hard for me to get interested in it. The scenery and use of colors was awesome though.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Like the John Cusack character in the film, when someone asks you your favourite movie, if you're a guy and she's pretty you better come up with a good answer like 'Cool Hand Luke' (for me 'Das Boot')...<br /><br />Serendipity is one of those films you actually like and for some reason you feel slightly embarrassed bringing it up in polite conversation. It's like those movies that can be become a wildcard in the conversation and if you happen to let it slip you've seen it before, maybe once, maybe twice, that it was on one night and you were flipping through the stations and the Women's Network was showing it and there was nothing else on but you sat through it and found it intelligent and satisfying, you might get a number of responses from 'yeah, I loved that movie' or 'its good but High Fidelity is better.'<br /><br />I will come forward to say I happened to enjoy this movie. It is a movie that shouldn't take it self seriously and if you watch the director's commentary (yes, I am one those), Peter Chelsom does mention on several occasions that the initial script was too serious and he wanted to lighten it up.<br /><br />John Cusack and Kate Beckinsale have a natural onscreen chemistry and if they were a couple you met in the real world, you would say, they make sense. They meet over something as insignificant as a glove at Bloomingdales and from there the movie becomes a charming series of coincidences and above average platitudes and realizations, some scenes with New York and San Francisco, a quirky side character here and there until all is well with life, cinema, love, the world, and so on.<br /><br />Molly Shannon is a nice touch as a the best friend of Beckinsale. She brings in a nice comedic presence as a character who owns a New Age store without believing in fate and destiny. Jeremy Piven is excellent as the best man/best friend who is supportive, goes along with Cusack on his search for his Miss Right and is taking notes for his own love life. What I like about the film is that it has all the trappings of a romantic comedy without them being one-dimensional. Chelsom noted he wanted to make sure that theme of 'being alive' was felt amongst all the characters. Even Cusack and Beckinsale's fiances are more than just basic scripted roles, obstructions until the main characters come to their senses. The audiences doesn't despise anyone. In a way, the film unrolls naturally, albeit with a few things that might make you go 'wait a minute' but then it's a movie and you can't take a movie seriously(otherwise Schwarzenegger's career would have been over years ago...)<br /><br />It's five stars because it feels like one of those classic black and white movies your mother watches on Sundays and when you sit down and join her, you only find out how really good they are.<br /><br />The movie doesn't take itself seriously and yet you believe in it at the same time. I suppose that's magic. Almost like a fairy tale. You allow for some things as long as the ending is happy and you can sleep well at night.ke about the film is that it has all the trappings of a romantic comedy without them being one-dimensional.

B009329ZF2|5.0|This movie was a blast to watch. Originally, the only thing holding me back from renting or buying it was the star rating. So, I am writing this review.  If you like action movies this does not disappoint.  The premise seems unlikely but they do not insult the watchers intelligence and adequately explain the circumstances.  This is a buy in my opinion.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Very well written. Jobs chose the author to write his biography and he tells the good parts and the bad, nothing is left out. He interviews many people in Jobs life to get their side of the story. Hard to put down.
B007NWCZR4|5.0|This is the second B-side song collection of the Pet Shop Boys, the first one being Alternative about 17 years back. This one spans from Bilingual to Yes. Surprisingly, there are more B-sides to Format than Alternative, at 38 versus 30. Of course, these songs take up nearly all 79 mins and 59 secs of each disc, so there was hardly any room for any more songs.<br />The truly good thing about this album, specifically living in the US, is it makes these songs very available. A number of these songs were incredibly difficult to obtain, and just a handful were somewhat \\"easy\\". Bilingual's B-sides are the most readily available, as they released Bilingual/Further Listening, which contains all it's B-sides on it's Further Listening bonus disc. The B-sides of Nightlife and Release were sporadically used on bonus discs in the US, but not all B-Sides were used on those discs. For PopArt and Fundamental, there was hardly any way to get ahold of them except through incredibly expensive imports. Yes is the only exception, as it's B-Sides were made readily available as digital downloads, even in the US. With Format, even as an import, it's still the best way to get all these songs, and make them all readily available.<br /><br />Many of these as-of-yet rare gems are truly some of the best songs the Boys have ever made in their career. Brilliant music with the catchiest melodies that far transcends anything commercially available today. From a song sung by Chris Lowe (Lies, a rare treat indeed not only that he's the main vocal but he's actually singing without any modifications to his voice or speak-singing), to many of the others, it's hard to imagine how the genius behind these songs works. All we can be is glad that the genius of Chris Lowe and Neil Tennant is not only still alive and kicking, but far more brilliant, zealous, and energetic than ever before, if that were ever possible!<br /><br />I hold PSB, Tennant and Lowe, as arguably the most brilliant songwriters ever, fornearly every song they create together is a masterpiece, steady, or even increasing, in quality from before 1986 to 2012 and beyond. In their entire canon, there are a couple of songs that tempt the mundane, or even earn some level of contempt, but these are far too few and far between to be a permanent blemish on their canon as a whole. The true genius of their artistry is found nowhere better than this, their collection of B-Sides where they are uninhibited in their songwriting skills. Even those with a mere passive interest in the Pet Shop Boys will surely find something on Format that is aurally pleasing. Put simply, this is an amazing compilation of pure perfection.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Re-reading this book was a wonderful decision.  I read it when I was ten or eleven and enjoyed it, reading it as a mature woman, with life experince under my belt the book was the same and yet so different.  I know I enjoyed it more this time but although it is the same book my prospective is so different, it was like  a new book.  It is no wonder that this book is still so read, it is still real and insightful into family interactions and personal observations by the all of characters<br />I recommend it highly
B000T9OP7G|5.0|Very exciting and not an overabundance of violence.  The actors are awesome with Lena Headey doing her usual outstanding performance as Sarah.  I couldnt wait to get to the next cd since it was so captivating.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|The \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" series are well done and keep you turning pages well past bedtime!  I wish I had seen a list of the sequence in which this series was written; I believe would have enjoyed them more, although they did \\"stand alone\\".<br />I have read and enjoyed all the Micky Haller and Harry Bosch books![[ASIN:0446556696 The Drop (A Harry Bosch Novel)]][[ASIN:044655667X The Fifth Witness (A Lincoln Lawyer Novel)]]
B00846TTDG|5.0|Very real to life experience. Kept me interested from the opening scenes. This film put me right next to characters in every scene. excellent directing! I want to see this film again!
0385344333|1.0|I, too, have enjoyed all the other Reacher books.  The whole violent segment at the end is still a mess in my mind.  I have no idea what the bad guys were trying to do, nor do I  really care.  Many other things that happened in the book were not explained well.  The car ride was interminable--it took up half the book.  And, yes, Cruise is a bad choice for the movie.  I won't go to it.  Thank goodness I got the book at the library.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a mindless waste of time game that is absolutely fun and brainless which is exactly what i love about it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but I would love it even more if they would put in more caves. all in all its awesome.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|\\"The Notebook\\" is a great movie for people who believe in love, committment and traditional values. The price was right, and the story was interesting and emotionally moving.
B009329ZF2|3.0|Slow start, weak plot, good graphics.  This movie is supposed to be based on the classic game by the same name.  Therefore, the aliens shoot pegs at our Navy ships that explode on a delayed fuze.  Yet their technology got them to Earth faster than the speed of light.  OK ... If you like good science fiction, this ain't the place, but some parts are good.  Bravo for giving the double amputee Iraq vet a prominent role.
B009CGYO0K|1.0|This book was very disappointing. Pathetic graphics and ve rylimited humor. Definetly not worth the money i paid for it.
B009329Y30|5.0|I thought this movie was very true to the book. I liked the fact that eventhough it's a chick flick there was the military scenes in the beginning that made it easier for my hubby to watch it too. I would rent this again!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game, my daughter set it up for me and I have completed all the pipe puzzles and all I can say is I want more!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Glad to have read the last book in the series. Like the first two better but enjoyed this one too. I usually do not like fiction but I had to see what allthe fuss was about.
B00003CX9W|3.0|First of all, I must say that my son and I were very, very impressed with the art work in this.  Considering this movie was made in the 1940's and how they did the annimated features back then, it took a lot of hard work, dedication, and talent for all involved to do this.  I was amazed!!!<br /><br />My favorite scene is the Nutcracker piece.  My second favorite was mickey mouse :-)  We didn't really care for the others (though the Soundtrack part was pretty cute.<br /><br />We skipped about three chapters simply because we were not interested...
B003IWRE3I|5.0|Lord of the flies comes to mind. People turning savage, no rule of law except law of the jungle. Kill or be killed.<br />There was the saving grace of the \\"fire within\\" and how it was communicated and a child's natural instinct to help others to lighten a dismal  picture. Hope is there, very fragile, but there. The Father's love is gut wrenching and understandable for his young son. A thought provoking and wakeup call type movie. I was riveted.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I wish that best-selling books like this one were translated into Spanish for Kindle reading.  Same for other books like Fifty shades of Grey, Kate Morton's, Barbara Woods', John Grisham's and other grat authors' most recent books.  Specially Ken Follet's trilogy The Century.<br /><br />Unless the latest titles are not translated into Spanish and included in Kindle's offer, this is not a very good option for me.
0810979772|5.0|My son loves the Wimpy Kid series and he enjoys being able to make his own journal. If your kid likes the book series he/she would enjoy this book.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|You'll appreciate this music a lot more if you see the movie Searching For Sugar Man.  Sometimes when you think you have no impact all, you find out you actually do.  Rodriguez is someone who definitely paid his dues and it is great to see him get some recognition.
0425263908|4.0|After reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I was looking for something to fill the void.  Bared to You was recommended to me so I went out and picked it up right away.  I was hooked from day one!  It kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to read what happens next.  I am heading out to buy Reflected in You (the 2nd book) today!!!  It is a little more graphic than Fifty Shades, but the characters are phenomenal and so is the story!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|You'll appreciate this music a lot more if you see the movie Searching For Sugar Man.  Sometimes when you think you have no impact all, you find out you actually do.  Rodriguez is someone who definitely paid his dues and it is great to see him get some recognition.
0345803485|5.0|I picked up the book after many family and friends told me to try it.  At first, I did not think I would like the book as the idea of women being submissive is not a turn on for me.  I was reading the first several chapters thinking to myself, \\"Why would any woman allow someone to dominate her like this?\\"  I wanted to put it down because it confounded me as it took me outside my own comfort zones.  But, I never could walk away from the book.  I realized how involved I was with the characters and craved to embrace their story more! Within one week, I had read all three books!!!  E.L. James takes the reader outside their comfort zones, and explores a world of unspoken desires, passions, fetishes, and a romance that will rock you to the core.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Brave is not a snow white remake.  At first, your tempted to believe the witch and the magic cake pattern after snow white.  Instead, Brave had the potential to be a great tragedy.  It seems the directors flirted with the notion that the queen would have remained a bear.  I think they should have attempted the tragedy and let Brave remorse the consequence of her choice.  I like the drama when Brave realized her mother may never be coming back because of a poor choice on her part.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Reacher finds himself sorounded by money and a great girl. But, in classic Reacher fashion you never know how things will end up. Fast paced with suspense. Reacher has to deal with a difficult loss and some very Bad people and he does the best he can with both.
B000ZP9PYM|4.0|I work in a kitchen are very good for the price.very comfortable and I  like the non slip soles.<br /> It arrived promptly and was exactly what is described ,
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I love the series. This book has the feeling that it will be longer than the other two books but it is about the same length page wise. Still this book is my favorite of the three.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|If you are a Diana Krall fan, you may or may not like this release. If you are a Diana Krall AND a T-Bone Burnett fan, you will absolutely love \\"Glad Rag Doll\\".<br />In listening to this collection of songs (four times total so far), I'm struck not only by the excellent backing band and great selection of vintage tunes, but also by the influence of Tom Waits on the arrangements - and I mean that as a great compliment. Ms. Krall is to be commended on her desire to honor her father with selections from his music collection, and thanked for putting the effort into being surrounded by like-minded people to pull it off so well.<br />Is it a perfect album? Not quite. On a few songs, most notably \\"There Ain't No Sweet Man That's Worth the Salt of my Tears\\", Diana's delivery doesn't quite match the song's mood. The arrangement is great, but she more does a reading of the lyrics than inhabits them. The effect is that of a great musician enjoying a genre of which she is not a master. All songs are enjoyable, but not all are in the realm of definitive versions.<br />When I purchase a new album, all I care about is the quality of the finished product. I do not insist that my favorite artists become museum pieces, recycling the same thing time after time. It's wonderful when an artist takes great songs and breathes new life into them.
B0099G3I96|3.0|Settle Down is a good time and the song gets stuck in your head. Push and Shove is typical No Doubt flavor and if you are a Gwen Stefani and No Doubt fan, you will enjoy this lastest effort.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a challenging puzzle game with soothing music.  With lots of different levels, it keeps you engaged while devouring time.  Watch your clock, you might miss an appointment.
B000005KQT|5.0|From the man who changed blues harp forever, this is a wonderful collection. Includes his first breakout song \\"Juke\\", the only harmonica song ever to go to #1 on Billboard, on through the basic list of his best songs. If you need to know what Little Walter was all about, you need to get this CD.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|realy fun game reminds me of going to the fair as a little kid it is so cool play it all the time
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This movie is fun for both kids and adults.  I love the music and my 15 month old nephew is mesmerized when he watches this.
B000000W94|5.0|Truly, one of the finest tribute album to Peter Green I have ever heard, not a shallow cut on this disc at all, powerful! with great feeling, I can't hear it enough, but my heart is broken, I find out that Gary Moore has died, I am very sad, because I just discovered him, I'm kicking myself in the butt, what took me so long to find him?, with tears, I will collect.

I am within the normal BMI, and continue to follow the low carb life because I feel so good!    [...]
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I happen to like historical fiction and the subject has always fascinated me.  The subject of the first book,Winter of the World, Book 1, was WWI and the geopolitcal events surrounding it. The subject of the 2nd book was WWII. The beauty of the the two books were the characters who became my friends. I admired  their courage, determination, their personal lives and their sorrows, joys and loves. It gave me insight into the political leaders of the times and how their personalities and backgrounds influenced the world and the events in history.  The books trace several families from book one through book 2.  I can hardly wait for the third book. Ken Follett is a master at drawing you in and laying it all out for you to envisionin in your mind. It is so easy to access the books from Amazon.com and it goes right to my Kindle.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|However Kristin Stewart is really an awful actress.  There is nothing animated in her acting, she has but three facial expressions and they all say constipated.  How this girl became an \\"IT\\" kinda gal is beyond me.  She acts like one of the better junior high drama club enthusiasts, however in a Hollywood movie, we do expect more than this level of acting.  The overall movie was predictable, and slow.  I really wish I could find the right guy who will return the time I wasted watching this \\"very not good\\" movie.<br /><br />I say, see it if you've got nothing else to do and this movie is one you can see for free.  Otherwise, I am sure you'll have a better time watching your dog's toe nails as they grow.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Don't care about the hoopla about KStew and producer, this was still a great movie! All the actors are do a great job, especially Charlize Theron, who is scary fabulous!
B008G12ERC|5.0|I read the reviews on this album and was not sure what to expect.  However I was plesantly surprised as I really like this album.  In my opinion it is just as good as the last 3.  Can't imagine how you can't like this album if you are a MUSE fan.  The singer is definitely a modern day Freddie Mercury, and I was a huge Queen fan.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|This book, all at once a send-up of certain science fiction stereotypes as well as a metaphysical look at the 'what if's of fiction versus reality, does an excellent job of grabbing you as an action story right from the beginning. The curious events of the book that happen to the main character and his friends heighten the strangeness of his situation (of which I don't want to give too much away), and the action sequences and dialogue between the characters makes this book a fun and lively read.<br /><br />Scalzi did a tremendous job here of using \\"the fourth wall\\" without actually breaking it. That aspect of his storytelling impressed me greatly. Also impressive, I thought, was his ability to give the characters lives of their own and seamlessly intertwine these lives with the higher, more philosophical themes that he managed to also present in the book.<br /><br />This book read quickly for me and managed to entertain me all the way through. I really enjoyed this novel and I'm looking forward to reading more by this author!

I embarked on an exciting journey with furthering my education. I decided to enter graduate school. I didn‘t have much time to read any literature that was not school related but I would manage to treat myself to a “fun read“ that was just for me when I traveled - Committment became my faithful companion that helped me escape to a place where I could face my own fears and not feel alone or lost.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really swayed by outstanding reviews. i patiently read each chapter waiting for it to pick up the pace. There were some surprises and predictable twists. Not worth $13 wait for it to get cheaper it's even worth waiting until you can get it at the library or used book store.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved this book! My first experience with Nicholas Sparks, and I was very pleased :) Loved the writing style in following the characters. It seemed to keep interest that way :)
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this story more than Fifty Shades. There is no other way to say how much I loved reading Gideon ans Eva's story but by saying I loved it more than something else I loved, which was Fifty.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another great Reacher novel. Reacher is one of the most interesting characters in modern fiction, and A Wanted Man does not disappoint.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Coming from two perspectives (Nick Dunne and his wife Amy)the story keeps the reader hating one and then the other, back and forth, so your head is spinning as the author takes you down a slippery slope of betrayal, scheming, and just plain psychopathic behavior. Many people I discussed the book with disliked the ending, but I actually thought it was perfect! Like so many of the great stories of all time the author merely suggests a conclusion that leaves you (disappointed? stunned? dumbfounded?) whirling the implications around in your head.
0316228532|2.0|It gave me a headache trying to keep all the characters straight. A couple if interesting strands of story, put it down half way through. Will try again later
030758836X|1.0|Several \\"friends\\" told me to read this book, but were enigmatic as to why. Turns out they were playing a big joke on me. Just like the author was! At the onset I found the concept of this novel intriguing - a suspect condemned by the court of public opinion - there's a lot of this on TV today. But then, when 1/3 of the way through the story, I found that everything the narrator had been telling me was false, I felt tricked, manipulated and insulted. About 50% through the story I regained some interest and decided to finish it, but then toward the end I got bored with all the repetion and annoyed by the way the character, Amy, kept addressing me as \\"you\\" as if she knew me. The ending was totally beyond reach, so far-fetched I could not believe it. Sorry, this is a big NO for me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun for both me and my children. I love playing in timed mode and trying to beat my previous record. The games range from easy to very difficult. It's a great way to wake up your brain in the morning or before doing homework. I would recommend this to any one who loves puzzles.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game! every 30 sec there is something to do. just don't buy acorns. And the animals are so cute!
0870703781|5.0|This is my favorite photographer.  It is that simple.  I love color photography.  I understand why people love black and white but something can be said also for color photography and what it has to say.  Here is the man that brought color photography to fine art, and this is the collection that did it.  So, if you have any love of photography as an expression of the human thought, then buy this book to see why color photography is considered art as well as black and white.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|The Composite cable does not work with IOS 6 at all, does not show any video from the IPad 2.  I was on the phone with Apple customer support, and they were so clueless that after 48 minutes they still had no idea how to help me.  Works just the same as the Rocketfish cable, not at all!!!!!  Do not purchase if you have updated your device to IOS 6 or you will be attempting to return the cable, just like me!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Well written and a great read. Morton ran at least three time lines throughout the story. It never got confusing and remained interesting. I can hardly wait to read her other novels.

Since purchasing it, I've listened to it about 30 times through and still haven't gotten over how amazing it is.

B0098WWEH8|4.0|Strong album for fans of Grizzly Bear. The album is quite a bit more catchy than Veckatimest, in my opinion, but not to the point of the songs sounding like pop music. You can definitely hear how the band's sound has matured after touring for the last record.
B007MU85D0|5.0|The entire album is amazing!  I bought it for one song and was pleasantly surprised that I like all the songs.  Definitely recommend this

It is the best adventure/hidden object game I have ever played, with super graphics, an involving story-line and intriguing puzzles. some HO games have puzzles for the sake of having puzzles, i.e., without really furthering the plot, but this game works at it.<br />I paid $1.99 for it and my friend saw my game on my Kindle Fire, loved it and bought it for IPad for $6.99.Worth it either way. Get it.
031237593X|5.0|Fantastic, wonderful, utterly absorbing.  How often do you finish a 900+ page book and want more?  The characters were vivid and the detail painstaking.  Only a few pages in I realized Penman was going to give us the whole story, in-detail, and I couldn't have been happier.  I actually worried because 900+ pages isn't enough for a story this big! It's not a fast-paced, plot-driven narrative; it is the story of a remarkable time in history.  The Sunne in Splendour is exceedingly well-written; we feel as though we know the characters and live in their world.  I could feel Anne Nevilles' heartbreak over the loss of her son over more than 500 years and I wept with her and for her.  Edward was so wonderfully done, his charm and intelligence, and his weakness.  Unlike with most books, even very accurate ones, reading this book I felt acutely aware that all of this really happened to  real people, and I cared deeply for them.  Penman makes her case for Richard III as a good guy very well and I will say that this makes the book emotionally difficult - but we know that going in.  We all know how this ends.  The hardest part was coming back to the world after finishing the book.  It's been two weeks and I am still a little lost, still a little mournful.<br /><br />I did read Rosemary Hawley Jarmans' \\"We Speak No Treason\\" before tackling \\"The Sunne in Splendour\\" and I'm very glad I read them in that order.  Penman fills in all the blanks and details, while Jarmans' book is an artful masterpiece unparalleled by anything I have ever read (and that's saying a lot).  Penmans' book is a rich treat, but Jarmans' book is...beautiful.  I also like the contrast in the cases for Richard III the two authors present.  Both make excellent cases for Richards' innocence in the deaths of his nephews, and both make so much more sense than the long-held belief in Richards guilt.  I also love that both authors create a very human character in Richard while maintaining a lot of ambiguity about him; he is an ambiguous historical character and I respect that the authors incorporated the lack of knowledge about him instead of pretending to know everything about his heart and motives.<br /><br />I walked away from the Sunne in Splendour (and We Speak No Treason) changed.  My eyes are more open to the lies of history (being written by the winners, after all).  While I believe the outcome was meant to be, as the Tudor dynasty was the birth of secular government, the stain on Richards memory is a tragedy.  I now have a very different notion of our dear friend Shakespeare.  I get that he was writing for The Tudors granddaughter, but what a jerk!
B005COO1X6|4.0|If you were ever a kid, or ever lived in New England, then this story makes some sense. You can almost recognize the rest stop (which would put you just outside Lewiston Maine. The only part that requires some acceptance of King's warped sense of reality is the nature of the \\"evil\\".

B004LROUW2|4.0|After reading Murakami's 1Q84, my first feeling was one of accomplishment.  At almost one thousand pages, this tome took a while for me to finish.  I also read the hard-cover version rather than an e-book format, so it was a chore lugging it around.<br /> The story is a bizarre mash-up of science-fiction, fantasy, and drama.  In other words, classic Murakami.  Two main characters, Aomame and Tengo, are thrust into a world of intrigue and danger.  Actually, they kinda put themselves in their perilous situations, making difficult decisions that lead to an unlikely encounter.<br /> Aomame, a young, independent, single woman, leads a comfortable life, and she believes herself to be content.  However, after meeting the enigmatic dowager, she must examine her morals and decide which path to follow, and if she can live with the possible consequences.<br /> Tengo, too, has a simple existence.  Unattached and private, he teaches math three days a week, and writes fiction in his spare time.  When an ambitious editor suggests that he re-write a novel for a seventeen-year-old girl and pretend that she is the author, he reluctantly agrees, though he continually questions the choice he made.<br /> I mostly enjoyed the novel, though I found it a bit long.  Also, the end was satisfying, but it left me wondering about some of the other characters, and what became of them.  In addition, there were parts of the story that left me puzzled, and I would have liked more explanation about them.<br /> SPOILER ALERT.  There are some really exciting scenes and cliff hangers at the end of some of the chapters.  In addition, the danger of the Sakigake guys and/or Ushikawa discovering Aomame's hidden location made for some thrilling reading.  The role of the strange \\"Little People\\" was confusing to me.  Even the characters in the book weren't sure what to make of them.  Were they good or evil?  Were they neither?  What was their goal?  I enjoyed the subtle, unexplained transition from 1984 to 1Q84, and how Aomame came to this conclusion on her own (or did she?).  At any rate, I also liked the unique love story interwoven throughout the book; I totally rooted for Tengo and Aomame to reconnect and have mutual feelings towards each other.  I'm not really into romance novels, but when I come across such plotlines in a story, I always hope that the characters involved get their happy ending together (if they deserve it).  The use of two moons as an indicator of a different world was unique and intriguing.  I also liked how it paralleled the maza and dohta of the air chrysalis.<br /> All in all, 1Q84 is an entertaining and satisfying story.  If you can get past the sometimes overwhelming details that Murakami includes, you will probably enjoy it as much as I did.  Be prepared to have some questions left unanswered; though you will wonder about certain scenes and characters, the overall plot is will enjoyable.  I recommend you read the e-book or soft-cover; reading the hardcover version is like carrying a brick with you to the coffee shop.
B007TK77QE|5.0|I bought this book, before it was released, with no expectations of what it would be like. I was very excited to find that it was a really enjoyable book and I was thoroughly entertained whilst reading it. I loved J.K. Rowling's writing style, the characters were interesting and her view of small town interactions was really funny and even twisted at times. I hope she continues to write adult fiction as I loved reading this book.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I read this book for my book club and found it to be written in an unlikeable style, with an increasingly implausible plot. I found it difficult to connect with any of the characters, their behaviour seemed unconvincing and I felt detached from them. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book, however others in my book club enjoyed it.

B001DFIVNE|4.0|This is a very good album of Robert Johnson covers. It's one of two albums of Robert Johnson material that Peter Green and Nigel Watson have released. Both albums are worth having. The second album is called Hot Foot Powder; you'll find it on Amazon.<br /><br />For those not familiar with Peter Green, he was one of the leading British blues guitarists to come out of the British blues revival of the 1960s. Green first came to prominence in 1967 when he replaced Eric Clapton as the lead guitar in John Mayall's band, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers.<br /><br />The Blues Breakers released only one album with Peter Green as lead guitarist. That album, A Hard Road, is worth checking out; it's one of the best British blues albums of the 1960s. You'll find it on Amazon; check out the expanded version with the extra tarcks.<br /><br />After leaving John Mayall's band, Green went on to become one of the founders of Fleetwood Mac with two other former members of John Mayall's band, Bass player John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood. You might want to check out some of the early Fleetwood Mac albums with Peter Green, such as Then Play On. To get some idea of Peter Green's influence back then, consider that the song Black Magic Woman, which was made famous by Carlos Santana, is not a Santana composition; it was written by Peter Green and released by the early Fleetwood Mac before the better known Santana cover was released. You might want to check out the Fleetwood Mac original.<br /><br />Peter Green was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the early 1970s and, as a result of his mental illness, he largely disappeared from the music scene. But he's still a very talented guitarist/vocalist and his newer albums are all worth the attention of blues fans.<br /><br />Peter Green and Eric Clapton are both alumni of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers; Green replaced Clapton in Mayall's band after Clapton left in 1966 to form Cream with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker. Eric Clapton has also recently released an album of Robert Johnson covers. Clapton's album is very good but I actually prefer these Peter Green covers of Robert Johnson's material to the Eric Clapton versions.<br /><br />If you like blues, both of Peter Green's albums of Robert Johnson covers - this album and Hot Foot Powder - are worth checking out.released an album of Robert Johnson covers. Clapton's album is very good but I actually prefer these Peter Green covers of Robert Johnson's material to the Eric Clapton versions.<br /><br />If you like blues, both of Peter Green's albums of Robert Johnson covers - this album and Hot Foot Powder - are worth checking out.

B0097GVJWQ|3.0|good hidden objects but not to keen on the whole back and forth to the locations over and over again. I do hope the next one is better
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Awesome movie. Love it. Great science fiction that has touches of horror. the beauty of this film is found in the cinematography and in the desires, faults and egos of the characters. Interesting mystery that leaves you waiting for a sequel. The movie leaves some unanswered questions that are obvious set-ups for a sequel, but, I think those missing questions create more anticipation, curiosity and interest when the movie is finished. Hope you enjoy!
B008QTUA5W|4.0|This show is a really good show! I love the fact that it is centered around a women. She is no joke! Most military shows have men as the stars...
B009KHBDUU|2.0|This movie should suffer the plight of the protagonist and be buried for  200 years.  it is unfunny at best.  The highlight is Alice Cooper, but you can watch him elsewhere.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the first book I've read in a long time that I seriously could not put down! In a mystery I like to anticipate the possibilities..this one went beyond my ken!  I want to know what happens next !
B000KX0IOA|4.0|respectable attempt to portray the profound influence one man can have on history, perhaps disjointed with respect to the evil empire and the muslim impact, I thoroughly appreciated the philosophy of non-violence and the elevation of the more evolved response to illicit ethical actions, although the civil war between Hindus and Muslims rather negated the entire effort and extinguished the spirit of the movement's leader... I found the compassion, beauty, and capture of history most compelling and never a dull moment for the duration...  film raises many questions concerning imperial vs home rule pros and cons, how to gauge a country's ability to govern, how to lead with dignity and respect, the level of committment required to dedicate one's life to freedom, and most of all - justification for the love and admiration of wife, family, friends and foreigners alike with humility and sainthood... takeaway line of ALWAYS is the true inspirational gem...  high recommend for Attenborough and Kingsley fans.
