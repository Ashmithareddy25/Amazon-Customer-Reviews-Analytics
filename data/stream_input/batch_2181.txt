B004XUMMFE|5.0|This has been my fifth time watching the complete series, first in HD.  The writing is funny, compelling and smart.  This rag tag crew has heart and the audience cares what happens.  That is why over a decade later it was crowded in ballroom 20 at comic con.  This was the first time anyone let Nathan Fillion headline/carry a series and he excelled as Captain Malcolm Reynolds.  Unfortunately FOX canceled the series too soon so some plot lines have never been answered.  (For die hards you could read the comic book series).  It was important that Joss Wheddon made a movie, not only because he loved the universe he created but it gave the fans some sense of closure for the series.

B007EW9ISM|4.0|A coworker was using their Cosmonaut and I was intrigued. The design was fascinating and fun, even the packaging is interesting with either a rocket ship box (my coworker) or a tightly fitting tube covered in space iconography (this product).<br /><br />This stylus feels good, heavy in a solid way.  Rubbery in the way that ensures a firm grip, not a peeling coating.  The tip is rounded and medium sized, so it may not be ideal for the finest of detail work, but I can write, sketch, interact with ease on everything from iPads to small screened smartphones.<br /><br />Everyone has a favourite type of pen, and similarly everyone will find their favourite stylus.  For me the Cosmonaut feels like a broad nibbed fountain pen compared to the cheap plastic roller-ball feel of most pen stylus.

B005TMSN4E|5.0|Works like it should and gives an unbelievable 2.7 magnification to any Nikon lens that you put on the J1/J2/V1/V2 cameras. It really does make you appreciate how far you zoom in with a 300mm on a J1.

0385528752|5.0|\\"Made to stick\\" of the authors is one of my all time favorites. It's definitely my fault and loss to have read their second book this very late. In short, it's a great book well written with lively stories, animated parables and practical advice to faciliate change in yourself, your \\"neighbours\\" and your \\"communities\\". In short, a must read. Highly recommended!<br /><br />p.s. Below please find the summary of the book on page 399 for your reference.<br />For things to change, somebody somewhere has to start acting differently. May be it's you, may be it's your team. Picture that person (or people). Each has an emotional Elephant side and a rational Rider side. You've got to reach both. And you've also got to clear the way for them to succeed. In short, you must do three things:<br />1.Direct the Rider. (what looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity)<br />- Follow the bright spots. Investigate what's working and clone it.<br />- Script the critical moves. Don't think big picture, think in terms of specific behavior.<br />- Point to the destination. Change is easier when you know where you're going and why it's worth it.<br />2.Motivate the Elephant. (what looks like laziness is often exhaustion)<br />- Find the feeling. Knowing something isn't enough to cause change. Make people feel something.<br />- Shrink the change. Break down the change until it no longer spooks the Elephant.<br />- Grow your people. Cultivate a sense of identity and instill the growth mindset.<br />3. Shape the path. (what looks like a people problem is often a situation problem)<br />- Tweak the environment. When the situation changes, the behavior changes. So change the situation.<br />- Built habits. When behavior is habitual, it's free - it doesn't tax the Rider. Look for ways to encourage habits.<br />- Rally the herb. Behavior is contagious. Help it spreads.<br /><br />A few favorite passages of mine is as follows:-<br />Uncertainty makes the Elephant anxious. And that's why decision paralysis can be deadly for change - because the most familiar path is always the status quo. Many leaders pride themselves on setting high level direction: I'll set the vision and stay out of the details. It's true that a compelling vision is critical. But it's not enough. Big picture, hands-off leadership isn't likely to work in a change situation, because the hardest part of change- the paralyzing part - is  precisely in the details....Ambiguity is the enemy. Any successful change requires a translation of ambiguous goals in concrete behaviours. In short, to make a switch, you need to script the critical moves. Pg 86-7<br />In almost all successful change efforts, the sequence of change is not analyze-think-change, but rather see-feel-change.

0440238153|2.0|I was finally inspired to start this series late last year.  I couldn't care less about the bizarre attempt by Hollywood to turn this into a (diluted) film but perhaps its release reminded me that I had always meant to check Pullman out.  My very brief subjective summary:  The Golden Compass - excellent, The Subtle Knife - good enough to keep me reading, The Amber Spyglass - terrible enough to make me angry that I wasted my time.  It is truly bad writing, and it sheds everything that was compelling about the first two books into little more than a hackneyed action-adventure script - perhaps Hollywood was already on his mind?  More likely, as at least one other review here suggested, Pullman was either tired of the story, under pressure from publishers, or lost the \\"courage\\" to develop his ideas. I have tried reminding myself that Pullman is writing for a 'young adult' audience, a demographic I haven't fit into for decades, but maybe I give young people more credit than either Pullman or his publisher because this final book just sort of insults their intelligence.<br /><br />I honestly can't bring myself to finish the last 30 pages of this.  It's that bad.  I will, at some point, but the last half of this book is so insipidly bad that I have put it down - with only 30 or so pages left! - and, literally, can't pick it up again.  So I will refrain from any spoiler-type comments about the unsatisfying way of dealing with plot.  I, will, however say something touching on the alleged 'atheism' of the book that has so scandalized people in the USA.  The few reactions of shock and alarm I have read about from Catholic watchdog groups are pretty silly and sensationalist.  For the sake of disclosure:  I consider the Christian concept of sin to be profoundly damaging to the human psyche and - dare I say it - soul, and there is no lost love between myself and the Catholic church.  I won't use the Amazon review section to pontificate (!!) about that hypocritical and repressiveinstitution.  However, lately I am almost equally irritated by the \\"new atheism\\" that has become very hip in a grating, reductive pop-culture kind of way (particularly in England).<br /><br />But the only thing that really matters about all that to me is: Does it make for good fiction?  The first volume of this series left me hopeful that Pullman could pull it off.  But it also left me with misgivings.  So, Pullman replaces C.S. Lewis' heavy-handed Christianity with his own heavy-handed anti-theism?  Ultimately I find that to be pedantic and ultimately boring as fiction, but I was willing to give Pullman the benefit of the doubt.  I was never, even as a child, interested in Lewis' Narnia books, but his \\"space trilogy\\" is a classic for a reason.  It is laced throughout with Lewis theological concerns (or, at times, saturated with them) but they are not an obstacle to the writing, and although heavy-handed at times he still deploys them with much more subtlety than Pullman.  This is not an entirely fair criticism on my part: Pullman's audacious and explicit confrontation of these themes is sort of the point, and in most ways one of his strengths.  But stylistically it is also more than a little manipulative and he tends to bludgeon you with his points.  I have seen Pullman make snarky remarks about Tolkien as well, and in my opinion he has no business slamming Tolkien when he was five times the writer Pullman could ever hope to be.  Although Tolkien's Catholicism does obviously inform his epistemology and (rather simplistic and dualistic) moral universe, it is very much secondary to his main concerns - storytelling, an impetus to create a mythology for 'modern' readers, and an obsessive-compulsive concern with philology that resulted in an invented world with kind of historical depth (albeit lacking in nuance) and vividness that set a standard that none of his admirers have been able to replicate.  He was also famously against the imposition of analogy and metaphor into his work by others.  His was a different project, and it is a bad comparison for Pullman.  But in my perception, Pullman is attempting a counterpoint to C.S. Lewis.  I am not sure nor even all that concerned whether he has succeeded or failed at that as a formal exercise, but I will say that ultimately his experiment was a thorough disappointment to me as a reader.<br /><br />an aside: The compulsion of 'genre fiction' to produce trilogies is pretty tiresome.  It seems to have long ago become more of a marketing decision than a creative one for most writers.  Attempting to slog my way through this last book reminded me of a similar experience - Dan Simmons \\"Hyperion\\" trilogy, which had a similar trajectory of diminishing returns.  First book was great (brilliant, in fact), second one was entertaining but mediocre (more so than the Subtle Knife, I should add), and the final book was just trite garbage.  'Hyperion' should have stood alone as a single book, leaving its more mysterious elements unresolved.  Pullman could have wrapped up the story he wanted to tell in two books, easily, and saved himself from the indignities of this last and unnecessary travesty.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|loved the cd and loved that it came so fast id always go through this person ? company .no damage at all to anything and was as described
B000HX499S|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!!! I can watch it again and again. When I purchased this movie for my kindle fire it was the very first time I had saw the movie.  I loved holly golightly character. She was so carefree. I also loved how they had a ring from the cracker jack box engraved at Tiffany. So much so that I quoted it to my Facebook page. One day I hope to visit the Tiffany of NYC and possibly own my own little blue box. I love to look at the pretty things on the website so I can somewhat relate to her fever for the store. Excellent movie just excellent!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son keeps telling me I need to get this for my phone.  Not sure I will but he loves it enought to tell me over and over again.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|JJ Abrams, producer of Lost, created Fringe. Fringe has not been nearly the cliffhanger that Lost was, but I still find myself pulled into the story. The kooky scientist Walter Bishop and his sarcastic son Peter have such a fun dynamic. I am streaming the program free on Amazon Instant Video through Prime. I'm enjoying the show and would recommend it if you like sci fi or the X Files or shows like Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. Its pace is about equal to the latter.
B000026FOA|5.0|This is the album that makes me ache that we couldn't have more time with this artist's imagination. Nick's arrangements on this album strike a variety but the album holds a theme of sound. Some arrangements are simply brilliant (\\"River Man\\" and \\"Cello Song\\") while others subtle (\\"Time had Told Me\\", \\"Thoughts of Mary Jane\\"). But in all there is a flavor here unlike anything else recorded. The balance between his absolutley captivating melodies, fantastic lyrics, and wonderful instrumentation from his accompaniment is all wrapped in a dynamic production value ahead of it's time. This album could be released today or even 20 years from now and still sound brand new. This is a true classic.
0740797719|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot because the author/painter pointed out a lot of key things that are important to know about color and light if your trying to become a painter. Keep in mind that he doesn't explain how to mix paint but teaches how light effect color.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Based on the reviews posted here, there must be big sample to sample differences. Fortunately, the unit I received is in the Good category. About the size of a fat postage stamp, this little amp works well for listening to music on my laptop with both my headphones, Grado SR-60i and Superlux HD668. Both headphones produce rich, nuanced audio off the laptop, but with the E6 in between, the sound is just that little bit better: louder, better separation of instruments, slightly but noticeably crisper, sharper treble and more resonant base. I mean, it's not night and day, but the improvement is definitely noticeable. For 27 bucks, a sound investment in . . . well, sound. Folk, R&B, rock, classical. All of it sounds just that one notch fuller and cleaner.
1579129129|4.0|You'll appreciate this book if your an artist who loves different kinds of skulls and wants to use this book for reference.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was amazing and had me wanting to keep reading. It was also a short book and I was able to finish it very fast.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|In times of doubt, this book serves as a good reminder, that lessons such as the four agreements are out there to help us find our truths.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was spellbinding, intense at times and a refreshing ending.  It should be a movie.  Reminds me  of Oceans 11, and its sequel.<br />Thanks for the imaginary ride.
159562015X|2.0|Do you like horoscopes? I don't. I also don't like this book, mostly because it's just as vague and useless as a horoscope.
1401307450|5.0|I'm a huge RCHP fan. The life of Anthony Keidis shows the dark side to rock and all of the struggles it takes to reach the top. You will not want to put this book down.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|this movie was not what I expected, but it was great. I have already recommened it to others. Jones does a great job of solving this mystry and the ghostly parts are interestingly good.<br />I  normally like John goodman, but in this movie he was the one to hate and played it well.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|It's always a good time to watch Judi Dench and Maggie Smith in any show together; this is no exception. You'll find that all of the actors are familiar, if not favorites, and this is a nice ride with some depth without being too taxing. We enjoyed it.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I happened upon this series by chance and decided to take a peek. By the end if the first episode of the first season, I was hooked!  It is intriguing to see the machinations of a king in that era. You find yourself rooting in the good guys, questioning religion and feeling sympathy for the king in the end. Very well acted and beautifully costumed. It was a must see for me.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|Nice movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon.we both really enjoyed it. We really liked all the actors so e decided to watch it and we weren't disappointed.
B00A83075M|5.0|Initially I wasn't very impressed with the trailers. Yeah I thought it was cool that they had all the throwback video game characters that I grew up with but I wasn't really expecting much from the movie. Although I do love John C. Reilly and he can usually make anything hilarious.<br /><br />My daughter really wanted to see the movie so we ended up going to the theater and both walked out the theater with big smiles on our face and wanted to watch it again. I'm not a big Sarah Silverman fan but I LOVED her as Vanellope. Her quick wit and comeback attitude really made the movie worth watching over and over. Her spunk made you root for her the whole way.  We are definitely buying this on DVD when it comes out so we can share it with everyone. Love, Love, Loved it!! A great movie for everyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The early, larger grids are fairly easy, but once you get through those, the grids get more complicated. I enjoy it very much.
B005LAIGN2|1.0|I remember the promotional tour for this film and thought it would be worth a view and I do have to say that it was excellent after the first half when I continued to watch through my eyelids.  I have been a moderate fan of Cuba Gooding for a while but this performance would have been better and more believable had it been done by the pets.com sock puppet.  Instead of a microphone, of course, the sock puppet would have to be holding a pipe!  I'm not a pilot and flying Alaska Air still doesn't qualify me to comment on the aeronautics of the spectacle but the writing was horrible, the acting took place off set and the story was formulaic at best.  Thank heavens I got it from the library, even then it cost me too much.  I am still wondering how you get a cockpit full of fuel in a fighter and how you take cannon fire through the wings without igniting the fuel actually there in but hey, I fly Alaska Air....<br /><br />Sad, the whole thing looked like folks making house payments, not a movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series of the hunger games was amazing to read I never thought I would be so attached to this series of books

B008FPOIT6|4.0|I bough this book on a whim, not knowing what I think or expect.  But from about page 10 onwards, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Well written, engaging story; good character development; entertaining; and unpredictable.<br /><br />Well worth the time and cost.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I love anything Hello Kitty! Super colorful and interactive. I love the tasks and this is too cute and super fun! :)
B009EEFTMC|5.0|one of the most addicting games I have played.  I am always trying to beat the previous score. Also different from any games I have played
1616550414|5.0|Zelda came out the year before I was born and I have been playing Zelda games my entire life. I am a complete Zelda geek (I even have a Triforce tattoo on my wrist), and I would highly recommend this book to any Zelda fan. It has incredible artwork, a complete history of how all the games fit into the Zelda timeline, plus a bonus manga at the end that tells the story of a new Link that comes even before Skyward Sword. This is a great book, and luckily mine didn't come with any bent edges or corners.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed how Grey and Steele's relationship evovled in this second book. Along with the physical connection they grew as a couple and actually fell in love.
B0038P59A0|5.0|this dvd is great if all you are wanting is the movie.  I don't care for all the &#34;additional&#34; crap, and I loved the movie.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Brainchild of JJ Abrams, this show is loaded with all the vitamins a good series needs: an exciting and innovative plot, along with well-scripted characters. Some episodes are a bit of a fill-out but the overall plot, much like the show Lost, is very interesting and has one at the edge of their seat. Anna Torv is a bit of a newcomer without much experience, but portrays her character very well. John Noble does a cracking job as the somewhat looney Einstein-inspired Dr Walter Bishop. The biggest surprise is Joshua Jackson who's getting a bit of a fresh start in his career with this show. He does an excellent job as the intelligent Peter Bishop, son of Walter Bishop. Another brilliant choice actor-wise is Lance Reddick, known from The Wire (which by the way probably is the best show in TV history).<br />The main plot? Well, strange incidents are occuring, perpetrated by a mysterious terrorist group using the world as their experiment lab. The events are investigated by the characters named above. As the story unfolds, the motives of this terrorist group start to emerge and the question rises: Who is the real enemy?<br />Scripted and created by the same guys who wrote the new Star Trek film, this show is the new Lost. It has been picked up for a season 2, and will probably go beyond that. Brilliant stuff.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Since I am a child of the 1930's the first two books of this series has brought back many memories and made me relive my childhood. I was thirteen years of age when WWII ended and it's surprising to me how much of that period I still remember and how well Follett has captured the feeling of that time. I especially remember the Berlin Airlift and the Marshall Plan, and of course the Pacific battles of WWII. There are a few things dealing with a couple of the various family members, in the story, that I would have like to seen handled differently, but all in all it was good. Maybe not as good as the first book, Fall of Giants. Looking forward to the third book.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Draw something is a fantastic game, however, the app will not work on my kindle or my friends'. The app opens then shuts itself down in seconds.
B001TODCII|5.0|When I first watched the Taken movie, I did not know what to expect.  I think this movie was one of the best action/drama movies I have ever seen.  I feel that human trafficking was a great topic for this movie to address.  This is something that happens in our everyday lives and it does not receive the proper attention.  Liam Neeson is the perfect character for the over-protective father figure.  I admire his passion to have a safe return of his daughter.  I understand that this movie is not based on a true story, but I am guessing it can relate to the real deal.  Going into the second movie, there was never a dull moment in this one either.  I especially enjoy this series of movies because the story-line is realistic and meaningful to me.  I hope people can learn to enjoy this movie as much as I did.  They are worth buying and watching.
1616550414|5.0|This book looks really nice.  I think it appears much more expensive than is actually is.  I bought it as a gift, so while I am not a Zelda expert, it appears that those who are find the contents of this book to be well done.  We are actually going to display it in our game room in a shadow box frame - that's how neat it looks.  Totally worth the money.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I don't even know how to summarize this book. Just read it. READ IT!! You will not be disappointed. It is beautifully written and so easy to fall in love with. Abby and Travis will be in my dreams forever.

159562015X|4.0|This book is an easy to read culmination of years of research and interviews into people's strengths. The author concludes that it is more advantageous to develop ones strengths than ones weaknesses and proceeds to quantify this process by identifying 34 fairly specific traits typical to people. It directs the reader to a web site to complete a half hour inventory of ones preferences and tendencies and returns a list of 5 greatest strengths and ten suggestions on how to cultivate each of them.<br />The disadvantage to this book is that it contains a single use code to access the web site. This book is of very little use to subsequent readers.

B000FCKGPC|3.0|Just highly disappointed. A momentum was lost and the boo dragged.  It felt like nothing happened. At least nothing that couldn't have been summarized with a few pages or maybe a chapter. I hope the next book regains momentum. I can only imagine having to wait five years for this book and  then another five or six years for book  five....I might've killed myself.

B008JF8O9M|2.0|This product is free which is the good news but the bad news for me was that I couldn't get the program to recognize my Google accounts so I could print. It wouild have been nice to have a help file or a web site that had a faq. I gave up and removed it from my Kindle fire,
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I could not find this CD in any store and no one even heard of the CD mind you the less. But I knew if I went on Amazon that I would be able to find it and I did and I love the CD. She is an excellent artist.
B000P6PVLC|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever watched.<br />Several plots with that were nonsense and had no real significance.<br />The ending was horrible and made it even clearer the plots were mostly irrelevant.
1403709866|5.0|Book was in very good condition. I absolutely love Pride and prejudice. If you have not read it. Please do.<br />If you like this try some of Georgette Heyer books.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Its suspensful, has a good story line, believable characters, and leaves you wanting more.  On the negative side Its very addictive and I now see walkers where ever I go.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Product was as described. I have watch this so many times its to numerous to count. The music is fantastic
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The rare book that is thoroughly fascinating in subject, fluidly written and profoundly helpful. I hope to make \\"The Power of Habit\\" a habit!
B000244FDW|5.0|This versions does not compare to the BBC version or the Kera knightly Version. The acting seemed stiff to me. I could not stay interested.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was hard for me to put down!  It was suspenseful and exciting.  I loved the characters and the  way Sparks has of withholding information until just the right time!  He's a very good storyteller!  I'm also a sucker for a love story with a happy ending with a surprise!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great site and I never knew I could get it on my kindle!! YAY Kindle and kudos to Pinterest for all the interesting and clever ideas! People are so clever!!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I was excited to read this book because I love to hear about these kinds of experiences.  I was glued to the story of how he fell into a coma, and the family dynamics that took place.  His descriptions of heaven, however, were, in some parts, very technical and I got lost in the scientific and medical explanations he used.  I'm assuming it was because he is a physician and a scientist a I'm neither.  Over-all I did enjoy it and especially the ending that contains a revelation and  a very touching letter.
B0009P66TK|5.0|Used for 4 days, everything is fine. It is a great looking watch, although i feel a bit &#34;top heavy&#34; because of this large bezel size, but this is what i've chosen.
B008C20TDG|5.0|It finally makes sense to me how food effects everything.  This book is an easy read and very informative.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting to get started in a Paleo lifestyle!
B000JIN3J8|5.0|The production value may be lower than the 1995 movie, but this more closely adheres to Austen's novel. More of her language is incorporated into the script. I thought Elizabeth Garvie was quite good as Elizabeth Bennet.
B000009ED0|2.0|Bought for my brother in law he thought it was great but I did not care for it not into tht kind of music
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I will not say that i use it everyday but it works well if you can spell. But if you get close it will give words to match.
141659521X|5.0|Book was in like new condition sounded like the series ender though. Needs to be more books about him. Another great read
B00AL1OV0I|5.0|BEST album of the year hands down some of T.I. best work period!!!! Crazy tracks and great features and dope beats.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing. Perfect twist at the end. Definitely a different feel from Sparks, but I loved it and feel like he needs more suspensful stories like this
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I had recently been considering moving, and had been nervous about making the jump. A friend told me to read \\"The Alcehmist\\" to help sort out my thoughts. The book is truly a wonder, I've never highlighted so many quotes to my kindle. A highly recommended book, especially for someone caught at a caught at a crossroads
B009G3T01M|5.0|If you voted no so gays and lesbians could be together buy this album also it has the song thrift shop!!!
B006OZKX02|2.0|i received the product and when i went and played the blue-ray's  one of the blue rays is for a special type of player a type B, my blue ray is brand new and it played all but 1 of the disk's ther should be a warning (x-men first class)
B0063IH60K|5.0|games come and games go but solitaire will always be my most favorite. it is a challange even if i do not always win.
B00821OX98|3.0|Very similar idea to the War of the Worlds, but with more characters. Not a very engaging story line. Pretty good special effects. I'll probably watch a few more episodes, but I'm pretty sure I won't watch the whole series.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Just started using it.I don't like that every freAking move I make it tweets it on my Twitter. Big negative..
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Definitely a movie with lots of excitement.  Much more than a typical kid's movie! Not your &#34;same old&#34; monster movie!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Got this during FAOTD and we are very happy with this game. This is one of those mindless matching games. Very easy to pass 30 minutes.
B0094K1JPC|3.0|Go-getter gets her dream job on morning news program that looks like its headed downhill fast. Lots of named talent in this one.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|All 4 films plus a bonus/special features disc at a very good price. The colors really pop, the sound is excellent, and the picture is much sharper than the DVD release. This box set is a winner ll the way. Reminded me of when I first saw the films in a theater, always a great experience.
B002ZG983M|5.0|hitgirl takes center stage but Nicolas Cage channeling tv batman (Adam West) is a must see!  I highly recommend this film.
B0084670FU|1.0|Among the worst movies I've ever seen. Very confusing and hard to follow. What were they thinking when they made it?
B000F8O35U|2.0|I was so disappointed in this movie's clarity.  Purchased this video for my granddaughter after watching an old VHS version and thought the DVD would be so much clearer.  Boy was I ever wrong.  The sound was obviously enchaned but the picture was not Disney's best restoration accomplishment.  Sorry I paid so much for so little.  Do not recommend!
B007HACDLK|3.0|Not his best for sure. The ending was very lame. Couple people in the book needed a real ass kicking but never got it. Rapp was kind of a pussy in this book.................
B000069HZP|3.0|I remembered watching this when it first came out in 1996. As I began watching this a week or so ago I couldn't quite remember how it went exactly and I was taken again on the same twisted mental journey as I did on my first viewing That is what I would have to say of this movie, you are taken on a twisted mental jounney. At this films ending came again the chance to breathe.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|It was a very good movie, not sure if it was better than LINCOLN, LIFE OF PI or FLIGHT!  I'm looking forward to renting ZERO DAR THIRTY andSILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK. Your rental prices are great!  We had trouble with the sound - not sure whether our problem or yours.
B004EPZ03Y|4.0|I don't buy as many DVDs as I used to, but this was a must for me. Highly recommended for all Muppets fan.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game and I know you will to!!! This game is very addictive and has great graphics!!! Do reccommend this game to people of all ages.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This movie entertains as it teaches lessons regarding the value of people who may appear &#34;different&#34; and how actions and unkind words are hurtful. My husband and I found it charming and quirky. We were laughing out loud at some of the scenes, loved the characterization and style. Khaki scouts rule!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Saw this the night before it won the Oscar for best picture. I remember the events when they actually happened, it was a breif respite from the ongoing crisis. I hope the Ben Affleck finally starts getting the recognition he deserves
B008KPDKAE|4.0|Much funnier than we thought it would be.  Was just what the hubby and I were in the mood for on a rainy night in.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great way to play with horses and it is very fun. It is for both kids and babies.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This game started out great but after spending coins to open the dressing room it won't let me go in. It keeps saying to download fullgraphics but gives me no option to download. Now not worth the space it takes up. uninstalling now
B009NQKPUW|4.0|although entertaining, I felt I had already seen the movie having viewed the original alien series.  The acting was superb, the special effects were great, I found it interesting that our ancestors felt it necessary to destroy us.  I would like to have heard their reasoning explained in more detail.  However that may happen in the next film, as the ending to this one was left somewhat openended.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This movie provided some insights to Bond's past. It also gives a nod to previous bond films that any fan of the series will appreciate.<br /><br />One of the best Bond movies yet.
B000W93CHC|4.0|You  get  completely  caught  up  in  the  life  in  Britain  in the  14th  century.  You  cannot  but  help  comparing  with  our  life  today  . I  think  Ken Follet  has  done a  lot  of  research  , but a  lot  of  fantasy  woven into a  Great  story .
B0000BVME4|5.0|The people at Sundazed did a great job remastering this album. Otis makes you want to bust out any hand held object and use it as a microphone.I don't know why this album wasn't in my collection earlier.. If The Dock of the Bay is the only song you're really familiar with, you will be a bonafide fan by the time the album is over.
B007FJFDXS|3.0|Played it a few times, really cool idea, but not a lot of draw at the moment.  It is a good puzzle game.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app is the most convenient replacement for a little moleskine in my pocket that I've ever found! I bought the evernote optimized moleskine and installed the app on my kindle fire, my iPhone and my Mac. Whenever I need to make a note, even offline, I can put it in whatever device I'm holding within seconds. I use it primarily for taking notes in class, which is pretty great- although without any special add-ons, it is difficult to write even simple mathematical formulas with the keyboard limitations- and it takes a minute to change the formatting of the text.
B004SRNH10|4.0|No problems.  It does what it says it will, not a lot else to say about it for right now.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This should be a school reading requirement for all children starting at about the 5th or 6th grade (and their parents!). A beautiful story of family, friendship, bravery, bullying, acceptance ... absolutely amazing. I was thrilled by the ending ... and, yet, I didn't want the story to end ... I wanted to continue following Auggie and his incredible family and friends.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend of a friend. It's a good story with interesting characters and a feel-good ending (at least for me it was). I loved the mental images of the circus. I would probably wear a red scarf too! :-)
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Says signatures are different when updating. Please fix. Excellent app otherwise. I heard that tunein has adopted google+ sign in which I'm looking forward to trying.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. it tells you everything about what's. happening with ur divide. it even shows how many hour you have left unroll your battery dies.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I had very low expectations for this movie, because, well, just look at the cover. I thought it was goign to be like Step It Up or something, but it was actually pretty clever and fun to watch.  Nothing highbrow, of course, but definitely entertaining.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Thought this film was entertaining and helps round out the Avenger's characters.  It was fun.  My 10 year son enjoyed it also.
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio list the local radio stations and with a simple click the chosen radio stations were added to my favorite list.  One click for each station, very simple and purposeful.
B003R50AW8|4.0|Markus Zusak definately thinks a little out of the box,  thought I would read this as I loved the Book Thief
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Not quite a good as the computer game, but does keep one interested.  I recommend it for short play time.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I just love that I can check facebook and keep up to date with my facebook friends.I also can see my Granddaughter when in the mountains.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really enjoyed this season of Downton, there were quite a few surprises along the way!  Maggie Smith is superb as usual, she had some wonderful one liners.  I loved the scenery, it made me want to visit Highclere Castle where Downton Abbey is filmed.<br /><br />Can't wait for the next season!
B0086DBE62|1.0|The timming was way off and the story was not entersting. Julia Roberts was not funniny at all. Just did not work.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's  great to go to Amazon and be able to stream the latest Downton Abbey. We missed the season 3 ending while we were watching the gkids. Perfect way to end a week.
B001QU4ZVS|5.0|Beautiful Music.  Glad she is recording again.  I hope she makes many more albums over the years.  Can't wait for the next.
0143034901|5.0|Set in Spain just after WWII and the Spanish Civil War, the first book in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books series centers around Daniel, a boy who lives in Barcelona with his father, a rare bookseller, and who has lost his mother at a young age. When their relationship becomes strained, his father takes Daniel to a secret place known only to a few: the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Here he encourages Daniel to select a book to keep and treasure. The book that Daniel picks is called &#34;The Shadow of the Wind&#34; and was written by Juli&aacute;n Carax, an author Daniel has never heard of before. Daniel is entranced by the book and becomes determined to find out more about the author and read more of his books. His quest leads to the mysterious finding that someone has been systematically collecting and burning Carax's books. While Carax was supposedly found dead after returning from Paris, Daniel finds that something doesn't add up. Helped by the man he rescued from the streets, an adventurer named Ferm&iacute;n, he begins to dig deeper and finds that he, his friends, and family may be in danger, not only from his research, but from the new government. The story is intriguing, complex, and draws you in completely. The author has a wonderful turn of phrase with some delightful descriptions filled with metaphor and simile that add some charm and humor at unexpected points. I look forward to the second book in the series.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This app is very fun I love it all of my kids do to it is super fun. Another app similar to this one is temple run I use both of these apps on my kindle and it is great
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Having loved Leonard for 40 plus years, I'm not entirely neutral, but this is a great album (CD?) and well worth the listen. Follow his career, buy all of his CDs. Don't just stop at Hallelujah, which is great, but he has an entire career of amazing songs and poems. Treat yourself, buy them all
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Don't be fooled by the well known actors and the Academy Award Nomination. This one is really, really bad. The camera, music and story just float all over the place. Unless you like these surreal type of movies you will be fast asleep within 15-20 minutes.<br />In all fairness I think this is another movie that some will get and others will not get. Seven Psychopaths is a similar type of movie.<br />Maybe this type of movie is for you, but I have no patience for this slow moving type of story.
0765325950|4.0|I had always thought that the Wheel of Time series was the hardest to follow compared to others that I liked, and that may well be due to my own limits in keeping track of all the characters. Reading how their stories end or fare in this volume was deeply satisfying. My only complaint is that certain details puzzled me, either because they are tied to something I'd long forgotten from an earlier volume, or I just did not get it. I truly enjoyed how minor characters in the earlier volumes played crucial roles here. Likewise, new characters loomed large in the Final Battlefield (particularly from the Black Tower).
B007SGM084|5.0|Absolutely LOVED these books and so glad I bought the Trilogy!  One right after the other & I didn't have to wait at the library for the next one!
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This movies drips with romance and hearbreak.  I know how it's going to end but I always hope that it will have a happy ending.  Meryl Streep is amazing.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|Just plain awesome toatally worth it Buy it right now seriously right now why are you still reading this review? NOW!!
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I recently had gastric bypass surgery and now need to time everything from how long between bites of food to how often to take various medications.  Being able to have both an alarm clock and a timer on my phone is a necessity.  I use this timer all day long.  Love the ease of setting.
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|The bike delivery and chase scenes in New York are worth the watch. The plot is believable and acting is OK!.
B0026WNGBA|4.0|As a runner who has endured my share of injuries I find this book very helpful and look forward to implementing what I'm reading into action.<br /><br />Currently recovering from knee surgery and this book jumped out at me and will surely give me the strength and ability back to have an injury free season.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who has endured injuries while running and so as to not discourage but encourage others that running after injury is possible.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Daniel Craig is a great 007! We like him better than some of the later ones! Supe stunts and action.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Don't like the commercials... That's what get for the FREE version.<br /><br />It's very interesting and works the mind in order to get the &#34;piggie&#34; where he needs to go in the best way possible.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to others most definitely!
B009JBZH54|5.0|It was Good. I mean really good. It was really, totally good. Entirely adequate, and then some. If you like Blu Rays, and these three Batman movies, then you should buy these three Batman movies on Blu Ray. Just think about how many times you could watch them: One? Two? Maybe even three thousand times each. Also, every set comes with your own personal fife! Now I know what you're thinking - why would this come with a fife? How about - why doesn't every Blu Ray come with a fife! Intrigued? Of course you are! Additional features include: director commentary, you can pause it!, fear, loathing, a kangaroo with boxing gloves, a dingo with boxing gloves, and a human boxer (glove-less). Okay, only the first two features are included, and there is also no fife, but come on. This is the Dark Knight trilogy! It's incredible! The price is awesome ( I paid $27.99. I've seen The Dark Knight Rises going for that much on its own). The picture quality is a little questionable on the first two (for Blu Ray), but the third looks awesome. Buy it, or don't. I don't care.
B006RBZV82|5.0|I rated this movie 5 stars because it was just as though you were right there in the making of this beautiful film.  It is just amazing and I recommend this movie!
B00BESCJII|5.0|This is a really great movie! Highly recommend it to both women and men. I watched it with my brother-in-law who's an actor and gets to watch all of the Oscar films and he said its one of the best movies he saw all year. Characters are well developed and likeable and really make you route for them. Funny, sad and sweet all at once with fantastic acting. Awesome soundtrack too! Don't miss.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|I love movies, this is one of the beat movies I have seen recently. The acting is so good it draws you into the movie making you feel as though you are part of the group.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|I liked this movie, but at times it was hard to watch. The characters have so much pain they are trying to figure out what to do with. Tilda's character is so torn between wanting to help her son and wanting to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone. She plays the part of a mother in such agony so well that it makes you agonize right along with her.<br /><br />This is not a light hearted movie, but the acting is incredible.
B001XULSG6|4.0|I liked the series better. It had a good story and expanded a little to what has happened since the series ended
B00005NVT1|4.0|Brill .. arrived safe and sound in only a very few days .. even though it had to travel to Britain from the USA ... great service as always
B009UX2YAC|3.0|the kids like it a lot , I found playing and watching boring, doesn't do much<br />its thoughtless to play , just move guy side to side
1616550414|5.0|As a longtime fan, I loved it. One thing that bugs me though it that it's written as if by a fan with access to a lot of artwork, but doesn't really tell you anything you don't already know. Pretty much, if you are a fan of the game, you have seen/experienced much of this already. Still, there's enough extra to keep you reading (if not just for nostalgia). Also, that's one awesome cover.<br /><br />By the way Nintendo: Your Zelda timeline is bunk. It's an insult to suggest that Link would fail. Bah on you.
B003JUGQ38|4.0|new twists so it kept me watching I think this was one of the better ones<br />trying to watch the whole series, I'm hooked
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Really enjoyed the book.  The only thing I didn't like was the ending.  I felt there should have been a little more, but I guess it was done on purpose, so that you read the rest of them.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|reminds me of all the quarters I lost playing it on the broad walk, to bad it does give out money, lol lol ,
B008LV8TSU|5.0|If you want fantasy that takes itself seriously AND maintains a lively sense of wit and humor, then I can do nothing better than recommend to you Howl's Moving Castle. I read the book after seeing the Miyazaki animated film adaptation and found that the book holds its own and then some. I have read it several times now, and each time it still makes me laugh. The story is fast-paced, sometimes sly, and full of classic moments-- such as when Howl returns home from his rugby club reunion, rather soused, and falls *up* the stairs proclaiming, &#34;Me? I assure you, friends, I am cone sold stober.&#34; Magical and a bit maniacal, Howl's Moving Castle is a fine read for all ages. Highly recommended!
B00BHMEALA|2.0|It is difficult to understand how this movie could be the \\"Walk-away favorite\\" of the 2013 Oscars, as I read in an AP story.  My husband and I watched it that same day.  He has a real interest in the story as he was in Military Intelligence at the time and has real knowledge of international affairs at that time.  Little remembered is that in the same year the Iranians took over our embassy in Tehran, a total of NINE such facilities were overrun by \\"students\\" and occupied, in most cases for only about a week, whereas this case was 444 days of imprisonment for the hostages, but the bad guys STIll hold our Embassy.  He can (and did) list at least a dozen other serious international incidents of that year.  (No secrets divulged here, all of the info he shared was publicized in the US and world press.) Well, back to the movie:<br /><br />As movies go, it was well made and acted, directed etc.  It might have been a good movie if the facts didn't get in the way.  The Hollywood connection was hitherto unknown to me or my husband, and was interesting.  The movie fails to give appropriate credit to the Canadians for their involvement, and seems to emphasize the part of the American appointees under Carter.  This whole thing, including the special features on the disc, seems to be a project to put an heroic face on Carter and his administration, when in truth this was really another \\"Benghazi\\" that went a different direction, but still proved to be a smear on the presidential record.  In each situation, the CIF (Commander-in-Chief) was not adequately aware of the situation in advance, nor were adequate preparations made to deal with such an occurrence, for which many forewarnings existed.  This is an effort to whitewash that which should not have ever happened.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Awesome video. Awesome service. I love that I can watch prime videos on TV from amazon. Argo was a very good movie. 5 stars!
B004LROUNG|5.0|This was the most interesting book he has written in years. Maybe ever. I could not stop reading and I thought I knew what was going on and was completely fooled...
B009O07NDY|5.0|I liked the music in the movie and wanted this one.  I have the music from the lord of the Rings and like them too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved the characters they played off each other fabulously can't wait for season 4 the only thing I did not like was what happened in the end of season 3
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Much like most of hollywood, they remake movies. This is one such movie that did not need to be redone. It is a shame,  because there were good performances and actors in it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|it is wonderful. didn't like the ending of the final episode and can't wait till next season. keeps you on the edge of your seat
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Was a good film and made you jump a bit, but it was an extremely silly movie. If you are bored, I would rent it. Or better yet, wait until it is in prime.
B008LFY6NI|4.0|I remember having a physical one of these when I was a kid.  Unlike that one, this one doesn't run out of supplies.  Yes, it's fairly simple as apps go, but it doesn't have to be complicated to be a fun little distraction.<br /><br />I'll admit I'm not quite convinced that this is a $2 app, but I didn't find it to be a waste of money either.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|The Eagles have been my favorite group since their first album, saw the documentary \\"History of The Eagles\\" parts 1 and 2 the other night, reaffirmed my opinion that these guys meant a lot more to their fans than just their tunes, people did things to the Eagle music, I remember my girlfriends, my hard times, all attached to Eagle tunes. I chased a girl up to Providence RI back in 1976, \\"New Kid in Town\\", \\"Wasted Time\\" and \\"The Last Resort\\" off of the Hotel California Album was my sound track for that time in my life<br />This new album once again demonstrates their mastery of technical musicianship and their song writing talents. I just hope there is going to be more to follow. Like all groups, they are of their \\"times\\", now with age, they still are.
0062101897|5.0|I am glad I received this as a gift years ago. It is a very detailed, very nicely written story of the making of the Harry Potter films. If you love Harry Potter, you will love this. The book is very big, and very durable.
B004SCN2F6|4.0|the game has a great concept is fun to play and is constantly being updated with new content. I personally have had trouble playing at harder levels but find the game enjoyable
B00164CM46|5.0|Brad Pitt does great, and Guy Ritchie does an awesome job, as well. Actually, everyone does great. Snatch is one of those movies that I could watch a hundred times and still love.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I used to love reading books on the adventures of Tintin as a child and was intrigued to see how much my 4 year old loved this movie. This movie was very nostalgic for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B001C1066E|5.0|I bought this as an amusing gift for my teenage son who likes  Naruto, When it coincidentally lived up to it's reputation (someone always empties poor Naruto's wallet on the show) that was priceless! Fortunately for my son the wallet was only empty for a short time and we all had a good laugh!
B00797MB0O|2.0|I want my time back!  What a horrible movie.  I am surprised Charlize Theron would do such a bad movie...
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Great read, this was a free trial for me however :-) I was trying out whyspersync and so far it's great!
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|A stunning visual experience, lead by artistic creative direction, with a very moving storyline, and the most amazing special effects.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a challenging game.  I started out breezing through the first levels, but now am at the more challenging ones.  If I think about the whole, before moving, I can finish them in a shorter number of moves.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Total fun in all directions.  Beautiful graphics, easy maneuvering of te cube, nice calming music, different play modes for the whole family.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's okay....I like playing it now and then, but it doesn't interest me enough to play more often than I do.
B008XG1X18|5.0|All of things that interest you in life can be shared on various Vision Boards.  With enough &#34;Pins&#34; you might even manifest your dreams.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The game is fun to play.  I like that the background can be changed and that there are easy to harder levels.  Though I know that the name of the game is spider, I hate that ugly black widow....they terrify me!  I would prefer an option to change the backs of the cards.<br /><br />Update March 26, 2013<br />I discovered that I could change the card back design, but I still have to see that big black thing on the app icon, I should have chosen a different game.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Great app for just relaxing, meditating, praying, etc.  Sound qualities are excellent on Kindle Fire.  Not a 5 star because you can't read & listen to app at same time.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Loved this movie would definitely recommend it to any halo fan lot was learned from this movie and nice recap
B001OQCV6A|4.0|It's a fun movie to watch. Give it a shot, I'm sure you'll enjoy it! It's quite entertaining. That's it in a nutshell.
0064431789|5.0|I loved this book as a child and my child loves it.  It's a classic and I am glad we have it as part of his library.
B007IK44CK|4.0|It seemed like a pretty good movie, but watching it on my desktop wasn't very pleasurable. I missed some audio and my screen is too small. I think WIFI to a large flatscreen is the only way to watch these movies.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This movie doesn't disappoint.  My kids and I both liked it.  My kids had never seen any of the previous ones and didn't need to in order to follow along.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|AMAZING loved it!! Way better than the movie! Can't wait to read another on of Nicholas Sparks books. He is amazing!!
140053271X|4.0|We have the old Nook reader, which we love. We purchased this Nook at target for the same price as Barnes and Noble and Amazon.<br />This Nook is smaller, which is nice. It has a built in light, which is really nice. And, it is touch screen, which is awesome!<br />The only flaw I see thus far is that you can't resize the letters. Apparently the letters are a standard size, I assume because of the size of the screen? Anyway, I would like to make them smaller so that I can read more before turning the page. However, that is a minor issue and does not deter me from enjoying the new Nook tremendously.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It was amazing and I was able to finish it in less than a week because of that. It is one of those books that will take  me a long time to stop thinking about it. The characters are one  I fell in love with and right now it is my favorite book and I also happy I read it. Please read it too.
B003274QH6|5.0|Everything good about the packaging and the quality of the image and wow the sound is amazing with the explosions
B003JTHXOK|2.0|There is a reason that I don't read Sparks. Cookie cutter, predictable and pretty boring. There are inconsistencies throughout the book that I can't believe an editor wouldn't' catch. I guess there is something for everyone but I am sorry I wasted my precious reading time on this book.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Shooter is an awesome movie. Great acting and great story. Mark wall erg is a good action actor. TED is a good movie too
084319958X|5.0|My 5-year old just adores Mr Men and little Miss books!<br />Extremely interesting books for young kids.<br /><br />My kid is collecting them one by one!
B000OXHRRC|5.0|A very good movie, I understood it better this time which was the second time that I have seen it. I missed a lot of the dialogue because of the English.accents. Icould not CC to work.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds Free<br />fun<br />all the adds and commercials get annoying.  I suggest turning off your network when playing. I would recommend to a friend.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for a good friend. She is a Joni Mitchell fan and was very pleased to get all the early albums on CD. She said the packaging was very well done and was enjoying the collection greatly.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|An  AMAZING read! It is the second book in this series and was just as great as the first book!  These books are very good! An excellent series. They pull you in and keep you wanting more!  If you enjoyed the 50 Shades series you will definitely enjoy this series. I am only disappointed that I have to wait until June for the next book!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|She is a big Rod Stewart fan and was thrilled to hear he had a new Christmas album coming out. Gave it to her on Christmas Eve and she listened to it anytime we were in the car over the holidays. I expect I'll hear a lot of it again next year!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very helpful with telling me the battery life and charge time and good looking app and I need three more words
B0095P31L6|4.0|This movie was entertaining for an adult...I'd imagine it is more entertaining to a child.  There were only a couple of times when it was laugh-out-loud funny, but overall kept our attention.
0385536828|4.0|I am a great fan of Ian McEwan's writing.  Even after this read, I still consider him my favorite novelist.  I have admired his work, from his early \\"dark and morbid\\" short stories through his luminous novels -- \\"Atonement,\\" \\"Saturday,\\" \\"On Chesil Beach.\\"<br /><br />High expectations are difficult to deal with.  And so, this novel was disappointing for much of the read, much like \\"Solar.\\"  Primarily, I think, because I became quickly disinterested in the cold war, British \\"stiff upper lip\\" spy-intelligence setting.  I empathized with some characters, but the \\"story\\" did not fully engage me.<br /><br />To those readers of a like, and perhaps frustrated mind:  hold on.  The final twist, the last bit, to a large degree redeemed this work.  In my mind, this novel is far from McEwan's best.  Yet, in the end, it restored my faith in reading whatever he might write.  At his worst, McEwan's work is a \\"4 star.\\"
B005HED08I|1.0|I PAID FOR THIS INSTANT VIDEO TO BE DOWNLOADED TO MY PC  ITS NOT IN MY WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER OR MY UNBOX -SO NOW IF I WANT TO WATCH IT I HAVE TO GO TO AMAZON .COM LOG IN TO MY ACCOUNT AND THEN GO TO MY VIDEO LIBRARY  AND HOPE ITS THERE - I DONT&#34; KNOW WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THE DOWN LOAD NORMALY A SMALL WINDOW WOULD POP UP AND LET ME KNOW ITS DOWN LOADING -IM&#34; VERY UNHAPPY  AND I WONT&#34; MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ORDERING ANY MORE INTANT VIDEOS FROM AMAZON!!
0060254920|5.0|This is a wonderful classic book that is beloved by children and adults alike! A little boy's bad day turns into an imaginative romp - a wild rumpus, in fact, with fantastical, wonderful creatures. No matter how amazing this other world is, at the end of the story, Max is reminded that there's really no place like home. My little boy loved this book just as much as I loved reading it to him. It's definitely one that will be passed down to his own children one day!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I heard this movie flop at the theater but after hearing all the good review for it I decided to take a chance and do a blind buy on it.  Luckily I did because I enjoy watching this a lot.  It had a lot of action and the graphic was pretty amazing.  The story was pretty good too.  The only disappointment I have is there probably won't be a part 2 since it didn't do too good at the theater.
B005PK553C|5.0|I like to watch this while on the treadmill  it is the perfect amount of time.  Usually horror movies and shows have cheesy actors and actresses. I appreciate the great cast on this show. Each of the episodes has a new twist to keep you interested. Sometimes you just need a well acted escape show like this.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|These are songs directly from the movie and do not sound like they were recorded in a studio.  If you liked the sounds from the movie then you will love the soundtrack!!
B005CMSDLE|4.0|...plus add a bit of Daredevil's Elektra into it -and you would have Hanna - the girl programmed for one purpose alone: to survive at all costs.<br /><br />Saoirse Ronan plays Hanna and does a terrific job.  It's almost like the screenwriters have amalgamated the characteristics of Jean Luc Besson's two heroines and infused her with some bada** Uma Thurman Kill Bill moves...I admit that I had some trepidation when I watched the trailer - which looked a little far fetched - a kid in an action role?  But the film is utterly convincing as Hanna kicks some serious i-can't-say-the-word-on-Amazon.<br /><br />With strong casting and support from Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett (it's getting a bit \\"old\\" that Cate gets casted in the baddie roles again and again but she's still compelling)...director Joe Wright has made a very nice action film that trumps a lot of Hollywood fodder any day.  The film has a heart too, which is nice.  Adding a few quirky David Lynch touches here and there, Hanna is a very well made, stylish thriller.<br /><br />Lead actress Saoirse (whose name is difficult to spell and pronounce) has a future in the movies, for sure.  I'm not expecting a sequel,but that would be nice...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A couple of sad parts but the series is great!!!  I streamed the first 2 seasons with Amazon Prime and watched Season 3 on PBS!  Can't wait for Season 4!!!!!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Extremely funny movie, lots of laugh out loud moments. Aca-fabulous! Fat Amy is by far one of the most interesting characters written for screen
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Although quite bloody and violent I couldn't help but be intrigued by the basic story.<br />If the typical &#34;blood & guts&#34; won't turn you off I highly recommend this movie.<br />(I never knew the Southerners were such ghouls!)
B005MSD6QU|5.0|The producers and writers have done a fabulous job of character creation and depth.  Each one is so different from the others and I love the quirkiness of Garcia and Reid.  And, the unsubs and crimes they commit are sometimes mind-blowing, but often illicit feelings of compassion and empathy.  Love, love, love the show!
B005DESVPO|5.0|Got my CD quickly and was so pleased. I had heard about him, then saw him on David Letterman and I have been obsessed ever since. Excellent seller, excellent product. If you like Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan you will love Gary Clark Jr.!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't say enough how I enjoy the whole series.  The production and characters are wonderful and I can not wait for the next show.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I would paya few bucks to get this. Great graphics, fun music.  This game is like the first Mario brothers game.  Love it!
B001XUIBNO|5.0|I have watched this classic many times and each time I am more impressed with the directing and storyline. So many classic lines and scenes to mention.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Get it. Its the best game ever. You should really get it. Your daughter will love this game. If you love horses you should get this game. You get to name your horse.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|aging Bond is sad to see, but he still has some tricks. a bit long but kind of interesting to see some of the older things revived. great scenery and production
B007IK44CK|5.0|Very entertaining movie.  Awesome special effects, plot is boring but all around it was a pretty good movie. It is worth picking up for you collection.
B006JRIZJG|5.0|I bought 2 of these Barbie ZipBins for my granddaughters ages 6 and 3. They love them! The box unzips and provides a platform for their dolls to play on. They use the boxes to carry their dolls and accessories from home to their friends and relatives. I recommend this product.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE, BUT TOM CRUISE ALWAYS BRING IT IN HIS MOVIES.  MUST SEE AND MAKE PART OF YOUR COLLECTIONS.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Super awesome. More obstacles for more difficulty. Only wish I could do other objectives instead of having to pass one of the three before moving on. Overall, great!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a good game to play to relax and kill some time. your coins come back over time, no need to buy them. at higher levels its pretty much unlimited so just have fun collecting prizes and bonuses!
B004GTKP3S|5.0|Great high & lows in the series. Couldn't wait til the next episode. Great period of time & they captured it well.
B0001ARCFA|3.0|I've had them all... Just tried the K240 (kept them for three weeks) and ended up returning them. I ended up with the Sony V6 and am very satisfied.<br /><br />The K240 are the most comfortable of the three I've tried but the sound is rather lacking. Like the other reviews have said there is very little bass response. The Mids are real dominant, especially the high-mids... They really, really didn't sound good when listening to 320k mp3s on my ipod. But they did sound better when I listened to my mixes through my IO Dock (I'm using the IO Dock as a recording interface). However, they didn't sound better enough for me to keep them...<br /><br />The Sony V6 are great. Maybe I've just gotten used to the way they sound as I've been using them since 1990. I had a pair that lasted 10 years (until they got sat on). I can hear the entire frequency range and like the way they feel (they're a bit too tight at first but will loosen up over time). They are a kinda muddy but not enough to be a deal breaker and its always helped my mixes sound brighter in the end. I can listen to my ipod or the IO dock/mixer and it all sounds great. And, yes, the ear pads are going to crack, flake off, and make a mess in a year or two... There are replacements that I'll end up buying and I wish I didn't have to. The quality of there sound makes up for this inconvenience. I wish the cord was detachable and that they were as comfortable to wear as the K240.<br /><br />The Sony V600 sound super-muddy and have all the other negative issues that the V6 have. I've noticed that they make my head uncomfortably ho when I wear them, too. Stay away from them.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'd gotten frustrated and flat out PO'd at the double click problem that is now typical of Logitech mice, after 3 high end MX mice failed within 3-6 months, warranty or not, I'd had enough.  The reviews of the Anker looked promising, so I took a chance on a name I've never heard of before.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The Anker really is a high quality mouse on a mid tier price plan.  Whether you're a claw or palm user, the mouse fits pleasantly in mid or even large hands (large hands will likely have to adopt a claw position which owner of large hands are probably already used to).  Small hands might have a problem if they're palmsters, but if they're clawers should be cozy enough with it depending on just how small their hands are.  The 3 thumb buttons on the right are *very* ergonomically shaped, they literally fit the contour of a thumb to where movement of your thumb is minute and by feel, about a hours worth of use and it becomes pure muscle memory.  Likewise auxiliary buttons are positioned very intelligently fore and aft of the mouse-wheel for assignment for buttons that you're more deliberate in your usage of, and the mouse-wheel itself can be a clickable button as well.<br /><br />The tactile quality of the mouse is also above average and beyond the price range's expectations.  The resting area of the thumb is textured rubber which is something you don't know you've been missing till you use it. As many other reviews mention, the mouse allows you to customize its weight in the back with 9 pins.  Using all 9 pins isn't going to make it feel like a feather suddenly transformed into a brick, but it does subtly affect how it glides across your pad.  Using all 9 pins makes the base naturally incline itself to being more anchored (sorry...couldn't resist) than if you use none and again, that is a area for customization that affect how the feel and glide of the mouse is for you.  I had never had a weighted mouse before, and now I'm hooked.<br /><br />The software is slick and simple.  It allows you to customize the 9 buttons with any combination of key commands you can think of, including media hot keys, macros etc.  Customization is as easy as click and select, and for those of you who might wonder where the native mouse forward page and backward page buttons are, simple as selecting a button, and choose &#34;forward&#34; or &#34;backward&#34;.  This extends to acceleration, point speed, scroll speed and polling rates.  These degrees of customization allows one to play FPS, Strategy and even MMOs with equal precision and ease. Because it has the ability to store 2 profiles you can flip between, I have a profile that matches my use of MS Office and it has greatly streamlined my use as keystroke commands are now mapped to this mouse.<br /><br />Overall, you get *alot* of quality and functionality at this price point, I've spent twice as much money on a mouse and liked it half as much as I do this one.<br /><br />Update: July 2015<br />29 months of steady, daily use playing games, doing work, etc.  Not a single issue.  Logitech could learn a lot from these guys.ws you to customize the 9 buttons with any combination of key commands you can think of, including media hot keys, macros etc.  Customization is as easy as click and select, and for those of you who might wonder where the native mouse forward page and backward page buttons are, simple as selecting a button, and choose &#34;forward&#34; or &#34;backward&#34;.

However most rigs these days have USB ports on the front, and if you have one of those, the mouse cord's shorter length is actually a boon IMO as its not spilling all over the place and as likely to get tangled.<br /><br />Overall, you get *alot* of quality and functionality at this price point, I've spent twice as much money on a mouse and liked it half as much as I do this one.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Born and raised in Detroit during Motown's heyday, I never heard of Rodriquez! This was a good story about a uniquely gifted artist<br />who continues to inspire his family and fans.  Hopefully now his hometown will embrace its native son and be blessed by his talent!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I vacillated between 4-5 stars....  i was left exhausted after reading this book.  It is emotionally draining and thought provoking about the relationships we have; i.e., the individual needs, the couple needs, the outlook of life, etc.  okay, maybe 5 stars with a cringe.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This application functions flawlessly.  If you haven't already downloaded it yet you owe it to yourself to get it.  It is the handiest.
B0077EBWVI|2.0|I didn't watch the movie til the end. The music was no good and it ruined the movie.Not as good as original Footloose.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|Good music overall. I'm glad I bought it, but I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. I think this album continues the trend of their last album; the music is still good, but less of it is great, and precious little at all is really awesome like some of their older stuff. It's still Muse though, so if you even kind of want it it's worth it at the $3 I paid for it.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|We liked this movie, in particular the relationship between father and daughter, and how they repaired the distance between them. Eastwood is the master when it comes to playing the stubborn old man, yet Amy Adams was able to convincingly stand up to him in her role. Timberlake is also impressive as an actor - seems very natural.<br /><br />Watch it if you haven't!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I bought this book after reading the prelude on my kindle because it was so intriguing having been written by a renowned neurosurgeon.  His story is fascinating and totally believable mainly because of his status in life.  After all someone in his profession who has had so much experience with life and death and who did not really believe in life after death until it happened to him.  His impressive background of science alone made me want to hear what he had to say.  The book gives us hope to believe in God and his promise of life everlasting more than any sermon I have ever heard in the religious sector. Once I started reading I could not put it down.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Two Graves pulls together many of the threads from former books in the series - in a characteristically engaging story.
0810983915|5.0|I gave my child the first book and now is on to the others, will not put these books down.  I felt it was age appropriate.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I had the opportunity to read this while in India, so that made it even sweeter!  Very entertaining and I read it in 2 days.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|The story is action packed, the music is great, the ending is exciting. I am glad to have found this on DVD.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|It played ok for a few days, then the icon image disappeared from both the Kindle Fire HD device and the cloud (when viewed from my device); it still limped along. But shortly thereafter, it refused to load. So I deleted from my Kindle and downloaded it again. The game reappeared on my device but again refused to load. Error message is \\"Amazon Appstore: unknown error\\" \\"An error occurred. Please download this app again from the Amazon Appstore.\\" So okay, I tried the re-download but to no avail. The download goes fine but the game just continues to give an error message.<br /><br />I give up on this worthless, time-wasting, annoying app.
1400069289|5.0|Charles Duhigg does an excellent job of showing how the habits we acquire over a lifetime can be either blessings or curses. The first part of the books talks about the research into how to develop new habits. Numerous examples are given to show how to successfully change habits that we don't want. At the end of the book, a short guide gives the shortened version of how to change a habit. Using these guidelines I am already working on the habits I have that I consider curses. I am making progress every day.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I've been having a lot of fun with this and the other mobilityware games. Great way to pass some time.
B00338QELU|5.0|Terrific book. I have read most of the Kurt Wallender books and this was a very different type of read. Riveting
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and appreciate how well written it is. Dr. Alexander is passionate about his experience and is so gracious to share it with the rest of us!!! He has courage and conviction and made his experience real to his readers. This book  is filled with education regarding &#34;the afterlife&#34; and helps answer questions about who we are, why we are and where we are...I have recommended this book to everyone I know!!! The book is fascinating, comforting and genuine.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has changed my life! Opened the door to so many cooking &amp; home improvement ideas.  I love the recipes &amp; work out posts.  Truly an ingenious idea ;)
B001TH7GT6|4.0|I had hooked up my dvd player with the video cable and there were no blues only greens. This cable fixed the problem. Blues are blue and greens are green.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Excellent story and cinematography, well worth purchasing for my home movie collection!<br /><br />Should have done better at the Academy Awards, best-director is not bad....
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|I didn't watch this in it's entirety and I don't have the old VHS for quality comparison.  In addition it's been over 10 years since I've watched the VHS.  With that said the parts that I did see appears just as I remembered it as a kid and my children enjoyed it.
B00846REIS|1.0|OMG what a terrible book. I couldn't even forced myself to finish this horrible thing. It's a ratchet version of fifty shades of grey. Don't waste your time and money.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have not watched the whole movie yet. Some of it seems to be 3D and some of it is normal 2D.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great books. This is my fourth time reading them. Just can't get enough of Ana and Christian. Their chemistry is so great. I highly recommend these books, I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|It's as if RZA found an old VHS of the anime Ninja Scroll and thought \\"You know with a little work I bet I could pitch this as a new movie...you know who I could convince to back this?\\"  Enter Tarantino and Lucy Liu with a splash of Kill Bill.  Sadly it fails to live up to the greatness that either of those inspirational movies are in and of themselves.  All parties involved are capable of so much better than they offer here, one wonders if they all owed a favor?
B00280LYIC|5.0|It one of those book you can get enough of I love the whole series. Their my kind of book with violence and humor and Greek gods. This book is a pro at being a supernova(awesome) book
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I liked the writing style and thought the character development was interesting.  I thought the descriptions of people and places were detailed so I could picture them in my mind.  I was hooked on the story except I felt that the last third just went on and all of a sudden it was over.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Too much repetition for my preferences. An interesting and amazing story, though, and it is a thought provoking read that is worth the time it takes to do so.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its like taking care of a real horse. I like how you get to actually care for the horse.its a little confusing at first but you'll get the hang of it
B00005JLIU|5.0|I recently watched it again and recalled why I liked it then.  A clever must for any home video collection.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|Great movie - can view again and again  Actors made a very believable movie and one with which to identify.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Chat options are too limited.  I would prefer to be able to select both dice rolls with just one click.  Would like to display my historical win lose statistics
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As always, Nicholas Sparks has written a beautiful story full of romance and suspense. At times a bit predictable but a great read. Could not put it down.
0761158464|4.0|Saw this in the bookstore and was interested in how it works.  Bought a couple of these books for gifts.  Cool!
B009O2XY12|4.0|This is fun to play with our Grandchildren - they enjoy &#34;freeing&#34; the Babies.  It helps with their eye hand coordination.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Each chapter is heartbreaking done.  Every one left me beautifully hollow, like loss itself.  Excellently written. Hauntingly real.  It is a book I will read again, and that more mature self will be touched anew.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|What can I say - I love Madonna and all of her Live Performances......  Cant wait to get the MDNA tour
1611761476|5.0|I listen to books because of sight issues.  I started listening to this book and wasn't quite sure where it was going.  It wasn't long when I started to really get into this book and all the things I forgot or didn't consider when thinking about how  people live around the world.  This book is a real eye opener to how ancient bans and tribes still exist and how they live there lives in comparison to our lives in the USA and Europe.  I have learned that it is never to late for  old dogs to try new tricks.  Anyone open to dealing with true reality will really enjoy this book.
B004LWZW7Y|1.0|If there was a 0 start I would give that.  DVD does not play!  This will be a hassle to return.  I have had good luck ordering DVDs on-line, but now I will be wary to do so.
0385344228|5.0|Mr. Landay has given us a well crafted, well written courtroom drama that keeps you entranced until the final word on the final page. The author has blended a family drama with a compelling whodunit. The writing is crisp, the characters are well drawn. This is some top notch storytelling.
0375869026|5.0|My grandson said the whole class had to read this book and it was wonderful.<br />i would recondmend this book for all schools to read.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This Showtime series is top notch. It is brought to us by the same people that were responsible for 24. Damien Lewis and Claire Danes are outstanding as a returning soldier that had been held in captivity by the Taliban and a CIA agent hat believes he is a mole. Well written, good acting and a mind bending plot.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is a great game! Really great graphics and sound! Challenging & Fun! I don't play alot of games, but I really like this one!
B000OXHRRC|5.0|A Romantic Comedy that is on my list of 10 best ever movies that I will always remember and watch many times over!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just outstanding, totally speechless. The ending left me totally surprised, I definitely wanted it to be longer, great job Chbosky.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie was suspenseful and held my interest from start to finish. I loved it! Ben Affleck is a great actor and director.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Of course the movie promotion got me interested and encouraged me to read the book.  I think the book gave much insight into the world of a person suffering from mental illness which has always been a taboo topic.  I have greater empathy now for those suffering with a mental illness and believe more needs to be written and presented to the general public on how we can actually help someone going through such an illness.  One thing I did learn is that the answer is not shielding or protecting the person from everything and everyone that may be upsetting to them.  At some point, we all must face our demons.  This book was educational as well as entertaining.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|As with many CD's, the first time I listened to it, it was fine, and the second time I WAS IN LOVE. While I don't care much for the Ave Maria or Feliz Navidad tracks, they certainly aren't bad. Shania Twain in &#34;White Christmas&#34; had to grow on me a little bit (I really enjoy that track now), and some might find a guy singing &#34;Santa Baby&#34; a bit awkward. (It doesn't bother me. I think the way they made it platonic was actually really creative.)<br /><br />As far as favorite tracks, I'm not sure I could pick one! They are all so much fun. Mr. Buble certainly captures the spirit of Christmas in his album!<br /><br />Seriously, sometimes my brother and I listen to it in the middle of summer because it's so much fun!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Have watch the incredible story a number of times.  Have shared it with many other friends and family members.  The story is really unique and heart warming
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I had to choose a nonfiction book for my English class. I picked this book already knowing I will love it as I am a fan of Tina Fey. An stays honest the whole book and keeps a smile on my face.
0802473156|5.0|I was leery of the lack of scripture in the book... as it feels more like a secular self-help book, but it did open up some conversations with my wife and I. Observations were made, actions were tried and sometimes forgotten. Try... try again, I say.<br /><br />I was able to share this book with a friend who isn't Christian, and she really enjoyed it...
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Atlantis really holds up as a great series, unlike many spinoffs.  If you enjoyed SG-1, then you owe it to yourself to give Atlantis a try.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Love It! ... fun and adventuresome with great picture quality.  Will enjoy having this in my DVD library for a very long time!

B0083P1QUM|5.0|Corwell seems to be getting back to her roots as far as the characters go.  This book is a real page turner, like the first books in the scarpetta series.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie and give amazing respect to the actual officer who accomplished the mission back in the 70's. It was very well made and I think it must have been really scary to go through the part of the film making that required presence in the Middle East.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I had this on my mom's IPad and I fell in love with it because I love horses. Then I was app surfing and I found it and my face light up!!! Great app

B000BKHL1K|3.0|I gave the Blomus Wall Mounted Wine Bottle holder as a gift this xmas. This person had great difficulty trying to install it and it is still laying on the floor in its box. I am disappointed that I gave a &#34;bum&#34; gift.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the convenience of streaming and not having to return movie to rental store.  Will recommend you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is my favorite game I play it every time I use my phone or tablet thanks for creating a AWESOME game
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book flew by. Safe Haven was such a easy/fast read. It was very different than other Nicholas Sparks books.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Good app, works well. Does pretty much everything that I need it to do. I dont have any complaints about it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever it is so fun<br />I like the jet pack I would definitely recommend that you get this app
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. I actually prefer to pin on my kindle than my phone or computer. I just find the formatting to be very easy to use and it lets me pin quickly. Perfect for a bride pinning things for her wedding. I pin so much stuff that I need an app that will keep up and this app works great. You also cant beat free!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Fringe is leaps and bounds ahead of any other television sci-fi in all departments - writing, acting, pacing, etc. If you love sci-fi and have yet to give Fringe a go, you're missing out.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|I saw this in theaters and had to buy it. Its such a classic movie. Perfect for any girls night or even for a laugh. My fiance actually sat through it and said it wasnt too bad! LOL
B009AMABH6|1.0|This was thee worse movie ever, couldn't believe that Robert Pattinson played such a role, which is why I bothered in the first place.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I havent had any issues with it. I think it works well and nicely mimics the mobile app for iphones.
0060589280|5.0|me encanto este libro super diferente y al mismo tiempo super sexy definitivamente es un libro para adultos no niños
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Okay, so if you wanna follow a celebrity or comedian, or anyone, you need this app to see their tweets.<br />Don't you hate it when a celeb pays someone to tweet for them?
B00BESLHEA|1.0|I thought this would be a good movie because most of what Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu star in are well thought out and have a good plot line.  This was so cheaply made, the special effects were like something from a 1970's TV show and the other characters were absurd.  Two thumbs down - oh wait a minute - maybe my 9 year old son and his friends would like it.  It's that juvenile.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent calculator app for the kindle.<br />This has become my go-to calculator & I prefer it over the one on my phone!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Who would have thought that such a little device would work so well. I paid aloit for expensive sharpeners but this little baby does the trick in no time. I placed one in the kitchen knife draw and a second one in my emergency preparedness pack.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Turns your kindle into an alarm clock.<br />Very useful app.<br />Great app, nice choice of alarms. quite a few settings.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I know if Lee Child write the book, it will be filled with a strong mystery. I liked the odds  they faced and<br />how they were able to overcome. I would recommend to anyone who likes Lee Child.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Few ads.  can play solo or two player.<br />Great when waiting for a table at restaurant.<br />Simple & easy to use & set up.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This is an outstanding movie. Very happy with the quality of the story line and visuals. I am a huge Denzel Washington fan, and he turned in another Academy Award worthy performance. Has exceeded my expectations.  Would definitely recommend to others.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The movie focused on the perpetually defeated mind set of the pilot. The pilot's problem with alcohol and cocaine was shown to be finally remedied by being in jail. The comment of the pilot that now that I'm in jail I'm a free man is insane and gross. Punishing someone for their dysfunction does not address the cause of their drug addiction. To address the cause of their drug addiction they need to explore the distorted thoughts that lead to emotional pain within and they need to address the nutritional needs of the body. If the nutritional needs of the body alone were addressed, you can usually get a person 100% free of the desire to do any drugs within a short time.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This is an outstanding movie. Very happy with the quality of the story line and visuals.  Has exceeded my expectations.  Would definitely recommend to others.
B00B10DZQE|2.0|The boy's pursuit of the ultimate wave was so he could feel more alive inside. A very sad ambition that many pursue is the idea that putting your life at risk will give you such an adrenal rush that you conclude that you are now alive. This pursuit of the adrenaline rush that drives people to do this is sad testament to how misinformed people are. Folks, Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven is within us. Finding the place of peace, love and joy as the normal state within ourselves is a combination of correct diet, and correct thought and achieving deeps states of meditation.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is a good animated movie. Very happy with the quality of the story line and visuals.  Has met my expectations.  Would definitely recommend to others.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|interesting , reminds me of not country for old men gives you feel old south and new south<br /><br />entertaining from my view
B008Y73940|4.0|I don't usually enjoy the movie version of books I've already read, but I did enjoy this and would like to see another one made with this character.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Overall the book was good reading but near the end the story seem to run out of steam and was a little disappointing.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is the best DVD to come along in a long time.  It was well made in that it keeps you interested and moves along at a good pace.  I have burned a copy and sent it to my daughter in Florida and we can't wait for the next season to commence.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was SUCH a good book.  It had me NEVER wanting to put the book down.  It totally engulfed me!
B0017I1IZA|3.0|Move on with Stephanie's character please. Enough with the blown-up cars, lost hand-cuffs & leaving the gun in the cookie jar or &#34;forgetting&#34; to buy bullets. Poor joe, she's got to be the laughing stock of the town.  It is getting a little old, but because I do enjoy the other crazy characters & the dynamics between Steph & joe and Steph & Ranger, I'll keep reading.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. The picture it paints feels so real. Everyone should read it
B0002VFXFE|5.0|You can't go wrong if you need thermal paste with this product. I've found my computers running much cooler after installing this stuff. I didn't want to pay double the price at the local store so I now order this stuff online. Fast shipping and cheaper if your willing to wait a couple days on the product.
1616550414|5.0|what an amazing book! high quality cover and pages! the comic is great and the incredible amount of detail contained in the book shows why nintendo is the best at what they do :) LOVE IT!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book!  I am so ready to start book 2 - I love the ease of buying online for my kindle!  THANK YOU
B0026PA05M|5.0|So yes, there may be something commercial-sounding in the music of Halestorm.  This hasn't kept me from being able to thoroughly enjoy the songs on this album.  Rock with a harder edge that's not quite metal, beautifully powerful female vocals, and lyrics and melodies that I catch myself singing along to - definitely a good find!  There's not a single track on the album that I skip when playing it through, and I actually rather enjoy all of the bonus tracks as well (in fact, \\"Conversation Over\\" is one of my favorites).  While not everyone will enjoy this album, I think some people may find themselves pleasantly surprised.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Quality game for the fire. Nice graphics are a treat! Storyline keeps player interested and excited to get to the next level. It's not possible to get bored during this game!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Stunning.  I only wish they were infinite!  I didn't have a problem with pieces being too small.  Totally addictive, challenging yet relaxing.  Completely happy with the purchase.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|I got this for my son. He loves it. It is everything he expected it to be. I would definitely recommend this product.

B008JFUTT0|5.0|Very inspirational.  The Detroit connnection was personal.  It is amazing that someone so humble and grounded, despite living a most difficult life, could influence the end of the most racist regime in modern times.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|I first bought a &#34;stick&#34; USB audio interface to route microphones to the computer. The audio quality was terrible, so the quality of the microphones was wasted because I wanted to save a few dollars. Absolutely upgrade to a standalone interface, and this one has not disappointed me!

B008RZF1UO|2.0|First, I think Tommy Karevic's voice is a bit wasted and unchallenged on this album, due to the composition style of a lot of the songs. Listen to him in his other band, \\"Seventh Wonder\\" and you'll hear what I mean.<br /><br />Second, as some previous reviewers have stated, I find the songs blander and less complex than previous offerings. I even liked most of \\"Poetry\\", which I think contains more interesting compositions than \\"Silverthorn\\". And I agree that while there are maybe two or three decent tracks, this album is not memorable to me like a lot of songs on previous albums. There is nothing anthemic and little that is interesting for my aural senses.<br /><br />Third, I hear quite a few re-hashed musical passages, blatantly similar to those used on songs from previous albums. It seems that for whatever reason, creative inspiration has been hard to muster and therefore, some songs contain rearranged facsimilies of parts of songs that were better-crafted on previous albums. I play my Kamelot collection quite a lot and enjoy the drama and creativity of their music, but I can't say \\"Silverthorn\\" has those characteristics.<br /><br />For anyone who has never heard Kamelot, he or she will probably like this album and without comparison, it could stand on its own. However, when comparing this to all their previous output, they had a lot to live up to when they released \\"Silverthorn\\". For me, it simply falls short of the standard of song-writing and technical complexity of prior releases, which I hope they can rectify with their next release.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Actors are excellent!  Episodes go by so quick & when they end you just want more.  Great all around; I wouldn't watch without watching the first 2 seasons.
0307346609|5.0|I had heard from friends how much they enjoyed reading this book, so I went ahead and ordered it. I read it in 4 days because it is such a interesting read. I would recommend this book to all my friends.
B001FB55L2|4.0|pretty good story.  I was glad I purchased it.  The actors did a good job.  I would watch again sometime in the future.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My only problem is the daily challenge, whenever the timer runs out it will not spawn the letters, ie I cannot even start a challenge
B000JMKTLO|4.0|this was a good read, enjoyable just like gillian flynn's other novels.  interestting idea, and did not turn out like i expected.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I enjoyed this immensely. It was a blast to go on this journey with Jake, while wondering what I'd do in his place... really kept me coming back to find out what was going to happen. Loved it!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Such a moving story.  He and his wife let you inside their world.  Lets you know they are not perfect, but had faults like us all.  He was a true American Hero.  We should make every effort to never forget him and what he has done for our country.
B0000067L4|4.0|Take a classical cello trained Scot; a South London boy inspired to jazz drumming by the sounds of trains he heard while growing up; and a self taught guitarist who spent hundreds of hours listening to American blues; combine with alcohol, hashish, LSD, and amphetamines; mix thoroughly and the result was Cream. Half live, half studio, Goodbye Cream announced the band's 1968 demise.<br />At least they had integrity; they credited Skip James with authorship of I'm So Glad when other bands \\"borrowed\\" lyrics, riffs, whatever from living and dead musicians. The royalties that James and his widow received from Cream's version paid for James' funeral. What a Bringdown does not directly address the hazards of trying to survive life in a super group but perhaps summed up the band's feelings after a short 2-year existence.<br />Badge's mournful refrain of \\"before they bring the curtain down\\" echoes a warning of the shortness of life on Earth.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I'm all for escapist activities, and if that's what you want then this book will work.  The plot is predictable, but most romances these days are predictable (I mean, honestly, there are only so many ways to tell the story of boy meets girl, and they've pretty much ALL been done).  The prose was often difficult to read, and there were times I had to re-read the same sentence several times to figure out what the author was trying to say.  There were also instances in which an entire paragraph was a single sentence.  I found myself skimming through the narrative until I reached dialogue, which had enough witty/clever banter to keep me reading.  I didn't really buy the hero/heroine's relationship, and I didn't feel the chemistry between the characters.  Still, they're likeable, even if the story wasn't compelling enough for me to want to finish it in one sitting.  More details would've helped.  I know the heroine's eyes were blue, but I don't remember what color the hero's eyes were, and while the book says the heroine is a computer programmer, that's ALL it says about her job.  I'm not sure it ever mentioned the hero's profession other than he's in business.  The secondary characters are barely there and their nasty behavior made me wonder why they were included because they added NOTHING to the story.  I was actually annoyed with the heroine for putting up with their behavior at all.  With friends like that, who needs enemies?<br /><br />If I had paid for this book I would have been irritated, but since it was free I feel bad for complaining at all.  I've read better, but I've also read much worse.  There are worse ways to spend a few hours, and you can't beat the price.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Have only just downloaded this game after my kindle fire told me I would like it have to say it was right my kindle was right on the money with this lol love the game and far cheaper than the real thing lol
B004EF65QA|5.0|I thought that the story line and acting in this program were excellent.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like to check all the time... So I love this app.  I have the weather where I am along with that of where my family members live.
B00821OX98|3.0|OK as far as TV series go.  Special effects marginal.  Acting pretty good.  Character development not bad.  Story is weak.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I love this app!  So easy to use on the go.  I have bought several things through the app vs. logging on to the computer.
B00019074O|5.0|I hope no one every tries to remake it or and a new generation ... it has a chemistry that you cannot imitate.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is fun lots of new boards to keep my kids busy and entertained I give it 4 stars
B00062IVKS|5.0|If you never understood to value of ''method'', if you never understood the talent of DeNiro, the 2 come together in this flick. He's at his best ... he IS Jake LaMotta.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Bought for my 6 year olds kindle.  Not sure how protective it will be if he drops it, but it's a sturdy, easy to use case.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I wasn't sure if it would be well adapted to film but it was. This is a timeless musical for everyone.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Really enjoy being able to stay in touch with many friends all in one place. Fun to look at pictures and also learn about things that I might have missed otherwise.
B009XY97VC|5.0|This album has the perfect mix of thumping empiracle tracks and sorrowful/moving ones.  A couple of them though sound out of place, but that should not deter you from purchasing it for you'd be missing out on some excellent music.  Blackheart, El Dorado and ALL is Hell that Ends Well are just a few of the best on here.
B00821OX98|5.0|the only bad thing is season 3 isnt out yet... close second to walking dead. Which is the best show EVER
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|A good update on the principals of traditional the standard Sherlock Holmes. If you liked the medical show &#34;House&#34; you will probably enjoy this.
B007704HO6|5.0|This book is written from the heart. How Bob saved James, is a wonderful story and I dare you not to feel moved. Once started I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />stephanie
B0026KX4HS|5.0|Kind of quirky which I like.  Tommy Lee Jones in a tongue in cheek comedy role.  And Will Smith is great too.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book satisfied something I have been longing to read about. Well written and full of love , this book is worth reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game but I can't get it on pc because my mom said its to much money.<br /><br />Minecraft is a lot of fun .
B00004U8H4|5.0|I haven't watched this movie yet, but it's got the guy from Newsies. I just assume it's going to be like Newsies and I love musicals.
B008ANFRGQ|5.0|Thanks, Steve. You rock as usual. stuff  stuff stuff stuff stuff and more stuff.<br />This is a great CD, buy it!
B000O77SRC|5.0|If you don't own this movie then I would suggest that you do indeed die hard. You'll die harder than Hans and he really dies hard.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I would have liked more backround information on Author and more information on other NDEs.<br />I felt cheated when I was done with the book because it was too short.<br />Loved the subject matter and the information regarding brain activity, etc.
B00006G8HX|5.0|This movie is awesome. Middle part of the 'Star Trek Trilogy'. Not to give any spoilers but they find Spock.
B004NELBPC|2.0|Dissapointing - not sure why they even have an app.  I have deleted it and just sign in using web version
B0000UJL96|5.0|You call yourself a nerd and you haven't seen this movie? How dare you? Hand in your nerd badge...YOU'RE FINISHED!
B003M70O5O|5.0|Loved the first season and the second just kept on rolling. It's one of those shows that once I start watching, I can't stop at just one episode.
B000083C49|5.0|Star Trek. The 80's. You. What do all of these things have in common? Well, if you buy this movie you will see.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Works.  I can find any of my files even the ones that get 'hidden' because of the interface.  I install this on all my devices.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I sm do happy that I have this app so I can see how much battery I have left to complete my work.  it really is awesome.
B0086QS7N2|4.0|A VERY worthy addition to the RUSH catalog. I took the entire family, ages 14-53 to this tour performed in Seattle. Everyone enjoyed it, and after seeing it performed, the album was a universal MUST buy, even from those who only have a casual interest in my favorite band of all time!<br /><br />I recommend getting the digital booklet edition or the CD. It's the best way for getting the context of the overall story.<br /><br />I hope i hold up as well as these veteran rockers have!
B008AX18Y6|4.0|This book was unfailingly interesting and full of energy. Will try one of his novels next. It was a pleasant surprise.
B005BW0VI8|5.0|This woman is a Godsend to this genre of music! Kudo's to her band as well, 'specially love Al Gare's Bass and Darrel Higham guitar work!
B009K0P10K|5.0|I got hooked early in Season 1 and the continuation of the story line has been great for Season 2
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is probably my favorite all-time app on my Kindle Fire HD. You can do Creative mode, which is where it`s always day time, you have an unlimited amount of all the blocks, and there are no zombies and all those other creatures trying to kill you. On Survival mode, it is day time then transitions into night time. At night time, all the zombies and spiders walk around and try to kill you. You start with ten hearts and when you have none, you're dead. On Survival mode you start out with no blocks at all. You can also save all your worlds on Minecraft. *If you have trouble with upgrading Minecraft on your Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD, here`s what to do: Go to the App store and go to Minecraft. If there`s an upgrade available, the button you clicked to download the app should say Upgrade. If no upgrade is available, it will say Open.*
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love this show.  Who knew all the fairy tales from our childhood stories could come to life in such an amaing way.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|i liked very much, good story line, they through in humor alone with some crasy stuff to. hope others enjoy.
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|This is a fun and different type of movie my kids loved it and so did I . It's more of a family movie<br />I'll recommend this film for people with a sense of humor. Lol
8866130109|5.0|this product is great, the only detail is that I didn't check the size, and is a little bit short, but its ok, my fault, and I love legos
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This story has spoken to me like no other. It is so difficult to imagine what victims of rape and abduction go through and how they get past such a horrific event. I have to admit, there are parts of this story that are quite gruesome but I think it is important for people to understand how hurtful these situations are. It is a wonderful (yet horrifying) book and I greatly thank Jaycee Dugard for telling her story. I know this must have been extremely difficult to write. She is such a courageous woman and I hope her life gets back on track. What a story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series  has been so wonderful. My granddaughter got me hooked and I spent last Saturday and Sunday watching it to catch up with her and her husband so we can hurry with dinner, get the baby to bed and sit down and watch another session.<br />The characters, the relationship between the family  and the servants is so warm and caring. Even the acceptance of a Irishman into the family was as I have read extraordinary.<br />i hope this continues for a long time.<br />Marian Hughes
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark left no stone un-turned with this book. It was so detailed in every aspect just how he did it. Most importantly it showed how becoming a Billionaire is possible for anyone with drive focus and determination. I would recommend this book to the person who's looking for a coach on building extreme wealth.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Bought a 3D movie.  This thing is gorgeous.  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten words.  Done!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is  far the best book I have read in  awhile!  With  a very unexpected ending!! Nicholas Sparks sure does know how to  write some good books!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Loved that I could download & listen to immediately. Amusing that it's cheaper there than here, in Australia - but that's so typical of what we've been subjected to for so many years (we're not accessed by a 6 month sailing ship trip anymore!!!)
B00992CF6W|4.0|Please update asap there's a glitch when you destroy doors its spawns another ill document anymore glichtes an  please put pistons make red blocks collectible and put pressure plates would be much appreciated
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Such an awesome novel for Colleen Hoover to debut with. If you don't fall in love with Will instantly something must be wrong with you. I just wish it was a trilogy rather then just the two. But it was truly a wonderful read! Highly highly recommended! Read it! Like, NOW!!!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Leslie Nielsen in a straight dramatic role.  What??  Yes.<br /><br />The first really good sci-fi movie in history.  It was the watershed '50s sci-fi epic.  Nothing that followed it measured up to it, though both we and the Japanese tried over and over again.  It blew away everything before it and sparked the imaginations of an entire generation.  Yeah, parts of it are trite, campy, and predictable to the modern eye, and there are a lot of '50s anachronisms (like the imitation Plymouth tail fins on the speeder).  Still, it was well written, well acted, and well directed with killer effects done by folks they borrowed from Disney.  The effects and ideas were so innovative that 15 or so years later, Star Trek ripped off a bunch of the effects, equipment, and ideas.<br /><br />This movie launched the career of Robbie the Robot (the real star of the show) who went on to star in several other movies as both a good guy and a bad guy.  His body was made of the material they made luggage out of back then.  He finally wore out.  Some of the mechanical effects broke and Robbie started to fall apart. Robbie was first put in a museum, then moved to storage, then finally sold at auction.<br /><br />Lost In Space ripped off the idea Robbie the robot, and hired the same guy who built Robbie to build one for their show.  The final construct wasn't as convincing as Robbie because the Lost in Space budget was considerably smaller.

B006G3D0SO|2.0|It was a project that was literally decided by virtue of a meeting regarding what Disney execs thought people might want to see. “Let’s do another Oz movie!” was the sentiment. And why not? Disney owns the rights to the Oz books, so have at it, right?<br />Well, I’m afraid this is just another of that tired old propensity Hollywood has to create stories based on not one, but two stories, thrown together into a crazy mishmash trying to be a sequel to the much-cherished 1939 movie starring Judy Garland and Margaret Hamilton.<br /><br />The end result of the melding of the second and third books in the related works of the first Royal Historian of Oz…L. Frank Baum…is hardly a worthy follow-up at all, and my miserly gripes began the moment I saw Piper Laurie’s portrayal of Aunt Em.<br /><br />Or rather, the version of Aunt Em as depicted in Director/Co-Writer Walter Murch and co-writer Gill Dennis’s script. Dorothy can’t sleep as a consequence of her memories of Oz, so let’s just send her away to a Doc with some great new electro-shock therapy treatment!<br /><br />Um, really? I read those books. This was the furthest thing from the Aunt Em I imagined!<br /><br />Granted, it’s a setup rooted in the original movie’s tactic of taking faces from the real world…as had been done with the three farmhands in the 1939 feature…and transplanting them into the Oz world, once again showing that the land is nothing more than a reflection of a little girl’s imagination, which again openly betrays the vision of the books, in which the land of Oz was in fact a real fairyland hidden from the outside world through the magic of Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, who is a no-show this time around.<br /><br />But I digress. It’s the electro-shock therapy offered by a Dr. Worley and his head nurse Wilson(Nicol Williamson and Jean Marsh, respectively) that is supposed to cure Dorothy Gale(Fairuza Balk, in her debut role) of her melancholy, but a mysterious girl helps her get free and they try and escape through a rainstorm, but the mystery girl is lost and Dorothy gets swept into the ocean with only her pet Hen, Billina, for company, and they take a sea journey back to the land of Oz.<br /><br />Or rather, the ruins of Oz. Turns out the Emerald City is a wreck and everyone in it has been turned to stone. The Scarecrow has gone missing, and the ruins are being patrolled by Wheelers…humans with wheels for hands and feet…and the place is being watchdogged by the Princess Mombi(the Oz version of Nurse Wilson, again played by Marsh), who in turn serves the true culprit of the land’s woes, the Nome King(the Oz version of Doc Worley, thus played by Williamson). With the aid of the wind-up soldier called Tik-Tok, the aptly-named Jack Pumpkinhead, and a flying contraption called the Gump, it falls to Dorothy to try and rescue the Scarecrow from the Nome King, while at the same time staying out of the clutches of the pursuing Princess Mombi.<br /><br />I suppose I might have found the whole shebang more acceptable if I had not read the original two stories that went into this unnecessarily dark adaptation of Baum’s works. But even if I didn’t, I’d wonder just why Murch had wanted to take this approach. Both the stories didn’t need to be put in a blender. They each stand on their own merits as separate stories and should have been honored as such, although I have a feeling Disney didn’t want to use the angle of book 2…a boy named Tippetarius rescuing the Emerald City from an invasion by an all-girl army, and later finding out he’s actually a she…so they went with the less daring notion of trapping the rightful ruler of Oz in a...huh? A mirror??<br /><br />Other aspects of the stories are decently replicated, while others are hopelessly mired in the kit-bashing that went into the script. The “game” the Nome King offers in Ozma of Oz is brought to life here, as is the sequence with the Regent Langwidere andher many heads(except there’s no mention of Langwidere, as she’s been re-purposed as Mombi herself). Other facts are scrambled, such as the notion that Tik-Tok is “the Royal Army of Oz stationed to stand by and wait for Dorothy to come along”.<br /><br />Uh, sure. Whatever.<br /><br />One thing I can’t complain about, though, is Fairuza’s Dorothy. The necessary spunk is clearly there, and she handles the role quite capably. I also liked Emma Ridley’s mystery girl, who of course is far more than just the girl-who-helps-Dorothy-escape, and she equally brings her true identity to life quite acceptably. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for Marsh’s Mombi. Especially when one of her lines had me laughing contemptuously in its sheer “duh” factor.<br /><br />In summation, I will reinforce that this is in no way a worthy follow-up to the ’39 movie, and I’m rather relieved it’s not considered the “official” sequel(that honor going to another equally mediocre adaptation of the second book, which found life as a Filmation-made kiddie feature called “Journey Back To Oz”), and I’m equally relieved to have read the original books first before finally hitting this up on Amazon Instant Video as a 48-hour rental.<br /><br />People were calling this a cult classic, after all. Once this mediocre sequel ended, I couldn’t help but ask myself why.<br /><br />I think I’ll stick to the books until someone in tinseltown wises up and gets a far more accurate adaptation greenlit!her many heads(except there’s no mention of Langwidere, as she’s been re-purposed as Mombi herself).

B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is the 3rd book in the Outlander Series I am now just finishing the 5th book the Fiery Cross.<br />Suggest readers start with the first book Outlander since it is a continuing story of the Scottish Highlanders with real events and fiction characters. The Clans mentioned in the book are real the battles are real. I have traveled to Scotland 3 times in the last 3 years and have been to all the places mentioned in the book and more. My Clan fought in the 1702 battle and the 1746 battle at Culloden. I have been to the battle field at Culloden 3 times and highly recommend this site near Inverness.<br />There is an excellent DVD called Visions of Scotland that will give you an idea of the landscape of the Scottish highlands.<br />Good Reading James McIntosh, Clan Mackintosh
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was introduced to Wool through the free first part, Wool #1, that is available here on Amazon. I had heard rave reviews here and there and curiosity is easily satisfied when there is no loss other than time spent reading. Since I'm here writing this, I suppose its no surprise that I devoured Wool #1 and had to have much, much more.<br /><br />Well worth the price tag, and probably worth much more, Wool tells a fantastic post-apocalyptic story that is both entertaining and immersive. Mr. Howey did a bang up job with his world building and managed to write a story that allows the reader to learn more about the world as much through observation as you do right alongside the characters as they expand their knowledge of the Silo and world around them.<br /><br />Aside from the world, many of the characters are interesting, even if they fit certain pre-existing character molds rather easily, and it is easy to become invested in their problems and journey. The plot itself, while a bit slow to kick into gear after the initial first part, really ramps up after the halfway point and some of the final revelations were really spectacular.<br /><br />Overall, Wool ended up being something of a surprise for me. While I didn't expect it to be terrible, I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it really is. I'm looking forward to jumping into the the rest of Howey's Wooliverse books.<br /><br />A quick note on the Kindle: Everything looked good and seemed to be well laid out. I read this particular book entirely through my iPhone app instead of on my Kindle itself, but it worked fine. I also didn't notice any errors, spelling or grammatical, while reading.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and simply adored it. The story is beautiful and the characters are excellent. It made me laugh out loud and made me cry. I couldn't wait for it to come out to be able to show my husband and get his opinion. And was rewarded with his appreciation as well. This movie is a don't miss!

B005LAII80|4.0|I had wanted to see this in theaters because I'd read in advance reviews that the 3D was pretty awesome but they pulled it after not even three weeks, which is really surprising seeing as \\"Dredd\\" is a pretty cool action film that will most likely gain a cult following.<br /><br />The first thing this film does right is to wash away the bad taste of the earlier \\"Judge Dredd\\" film with Stallone in the lead. I like the Dredd character and I'm not really a diehard fan or anything but I knew while watching the Stallone film that showing Dredd without the helmet was a big mistake that probably doomed the film single-handedly, a mistake that this film wisely avoids. Karl Urban takes over the role for this installment and I have to say, he nails the character perfectly. Considering that this was a fairly low budget film, you wouldn't really think so when you take the production design and special effects into account. \\"Dredd\\" is very stylized and almost immediately, you're thrust into this post-apocalyptic world where citizens live in these huge, overpopulated cities where crime runs rampant and the dwindling number of authorities in the form of Judges act as judge, jury and executioner. The special effects are pretty impressive, especially whenever the film slows to a crawl as various characters partake in Slo-Mo, a drug that makes you experience things at 1/100th speed. It's in these scenes that I really get bummed out about not seeing the film theatrically in 3D because they are visually incredible and a sight to behold.<br /><br />I think the fun in watching this movie is in not knowing how it's going to play out so I'll just say that while the plot is pretty simple, there is more than enough here to keep any action fan interested and Lena Headley (Queen Cersei from HBO's \\"Game of Thrones\\") is especially a joy to watch in this as the sadistic main villain, Ma Ma. You've probably heard that it's very similar to \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" and it is but to think that you should skip out on this film because you already saw \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" is to do yourself and \\"Dredd\\" a great disservice. They're similar in concept but different animals entirely.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray presents the film in 3D but since I don't have a 3D TV, I wasn't able to watch the film in that format. In regular HD, the film looks fantastic and the surround sound is very active. The extras are standard stuff (vfx and production featurettes) with the best segment focusing on Dredd's long history in comics. A lot of comic industry people chime in on the character and you really get a sense of how influential the character was and how timeless he is. Again, I didn't see the 3D version on the disc so I apologize for not being able to give you the scoop on that but I'm sure it must look astounding.<br /><br />I walked away from this film with a better appreciation for the character and a desire to see more. Dredd got shafted during its run in movie houses and it deserved a lot better of a reception than it got. I give this film a solid thumbs up and as a pulpy, ultra violent, retro action film, it works really well. Really hoping \\"Dredd\\" gets a sequel or two.d skip out on this film because you already saw \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" is to do yourself and \\"Dredd\\" a great disservice.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is the second book on NDEs that I have read. I enjoyed this one much more than the first book I read. Some of the technical aspects were a bit difficult for me, but obviously key in the telling of Dr. Alexander's story. Like others, I wish he would have talked more about the NDE itself. Although I am not totally convinced about the validity of this (or any) NDE, Dr. Alexander seems like a wonderful man. I found his book to be a fascinating and enjoyable read.

1250012570|3.0|always have problems reviewing 3 star books. They fall under the category of \\"its ok\\" which makes it hard to talk about that I liked or disliked about the book. The writing in this book wasn't the best but it didn't really bother me.<br /><br />The characters were ok too. Eleanor is a pretty depressed girl, which in her circumstances she should be. She cries quite a bit. Every time something happened with her and Park she would tear up.  As Park says a couple times throughout the book, she is not a very nice person and she is not very nice to look at. She has a very unique clothing style which is not entirely her fault but interesting nonetheless. Her family (stepfather to be precise) is not very good. She has a white trash family with an abusive stepfather and a mother that cares more about him than her kids.<br /><br />Park is a skinny Asian kid that doesn't feel like he fits in with his family. He has some emotional problems with his father but they aren't really talked about until closer to the end of the book. He also has an interesting style but not nearly as unique as Eleanor's. He is into punk rock music and comic books.<br /><br />They are both meant to be unattractive and they would both be outcasts if it wasn't for Park's childhood friends.<br /><br />The rest of the characters you don't really learn much about. They are just kind of there to further on the story. Tina is a pretty horrible person at the beginning. She is the main bully in the story and sometimes I can't believe people would actually act like that or do things that she does but I know it does happen a lot.<br /><br />The ending of the story was bittersweet. That may have been the part I liked the most but I think there could have been more. The very last bit was actually kind of confusing to me. That may have just been me though.<br /><br />If you like romantic comedies then I say go ahead and give this book a try. If I stumble across any other books written by this author then I might pick it up.<br /><br />*This was provided by NetGalley & the Publisher in exchange for an honest review.

B006XABLAE|3.0|I was really excited to get this cd as I am a big fan. Vince and Martin are amazing producers, but maybe too amazing to approach what was what I thought to be an &#34;underground&#34; minimal techno project. The production is flawless, as is the programming, but the songs (notice I say &#34;songs&#34; instead of &#34;tracks&#34;) fall too much into a typical structure format with very predictable changes. I am not saying the production should have been less, but the boys should not be afraid to just let the brilliant sequences bubble along when working in the &#34;techno&#34; genre'. Having said that, it was worth the price to hear a couple of my heros have their hand at a techno release, I just don't expect it to be played at Tresor.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a very moving account of the difficulties, physical, emotional, and spiritual, that children and teens face while fighting cancer. The main character, Hazel, is fighting lung cancer. In the context of the emotional roller coaster of cancer survival, she forms a relationship with Augustus (leg amputee); corresponds with the Dutch author of her favorite book; and supports a blind friend in his fight with eye cancer.  The story deals with the struggles head on with a delicate balance of humor and pathos without becoming sappy or insipid.  This is the genious of the writing style of John Green. I definitely want to read more books by Green.
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Another great movie to own. Anyone who loves movies like this has to own it. Great price for a classic blu-ray.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|There is no way for me to figure out how to download music for the clock I have tried every thing I could DON'T DOWNLOAD , DOWNLOAD alarm clock extreme
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I don't know anyone who doesn't own it or hasn't seen it. If you haven't done either, you should probably get on it. Great classic movie.
B000069HK2|5.0|First heard their music on Krock back in the day when that radio station existed, glad I bought the CD, great music, great great vocals, highly recommend!!!!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This headset has great sound quality, Voices don't sound distorted. Wonderfully made.The volume controls are easy to use and access while playing.
B004MPI5SS|3.0|I only rented this because a friend of mine was describing this movie that he saw in the 70's so i decided to watch the new version.  I'll be quick and simple with this, I love revenge movies so when I heard it was about a woman getting back at guys for violating her I thought as long as the rape scene isn't to difficult to watch this should be good.  Well the rape scene is horrifying but once you get past that its always great to see the revenge factor and the way she gets revenge is awesome!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Even though the kindle versions of Follett books tend to cost more than the average, the trade off is that even if you are a rapid reader it will take you 3-5 days of solid reading to finish one of his &#34;epic&#34; novels.  Pretty decent trade off in my opinion.  Ken Follett starts his books slowly (think Leon Uris) but by the end of the first third you have met all the significant characters.  His epic stories are rarely a rollercoaster ride, and this one isn't, but it definitely provides a different perception of the WWI era, England, France, and Germany.  It delves into some of the social issues such as votes for women, labor unions, communism, socialism, and the perspectives of the different classes.  You always learn something from his books in a much more enjoyable way than most straight History books.<br /><br />This is not a lightweight beach read.  Excellent writing, absorbing characters, interesting information all set against a backdrop of the early 1900's.  If you don't know much about this time period in England, Germany, France or WWI you might enjoy this!
B00A77II0U|4.0|The game itself was entertaining...good graphics.  I have only completed the first one and I am looking forward to what else is included for $2.99.  The main reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 was because the game froze up quite a few times which was frustrating.  All and all it was worth the money.
1878424319|5.0|My purchase was perfect. I ordered these books on behalf of my Sunday school class and lead the discussion of our reading. The books arrived in excellent condition and I could not beat the price.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I love Fringe, it is one of my all time favorite series ever.  It ties me in emotionally every season.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite book out of the whole series. It is just fantastic and an awesome work of art. I have no other words
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you like to read a love story with a complex relationship and friendships you love this book.  Make sure to read &#34;Bare to You&#34; first.  I'm looking forward to &#34;Entwined with You&#34; being released in June.  I've got mine on order.  Complex suspense.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is so fun and addicting. it is a great game.also it is cool how you can skip levels if you are stuck.
B00123B7N8|5.0|If you're a fan of heavy metal and Pantera this is a must have. In fact their first three albums need to be in your collection. Well crafted songs, great sounding recording, and Dimebag. What more do you need to know?
B00A3OSXVG|5.0|Listening to this collection makes me smile.  This is the best style of music ever recorded.  This collection brings together some of the best psychedelic music ever.  My only compliant is it is too short.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|This movie was a great prequel to the classic sci-fi horror movies from back in the day.  Special effects and audio effects were top notch.  I would definitely recommend checking this movie out, even if you already watched it in the theater.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|Stevie Nicks is my favorite singer for years. Was looking forward to a new CD from her but I'm a little disappointed. Still has a great voice!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I LOVED this series. I love European historical fiction. Even my husband loved it!  I can't wait to watch Season 3!
B00136JS12|5.0|There was only one band with this sound... one inch from perfection<br />The music and lyrics are inspired and meaningful.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Angry Birds Space was a little too weird for me.  I always enjoyed the 'normal' Angry Birds as a fun way to pass time, but there was too much to figure out.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I play this game a lot on long car rides and when bored at work. Fun game that I've had on numerous phones.
B005HSL626|3.0|..but ultimately boring. After a while you realize you are never going to get better and it's time to move on. Great for my 3-year old, however. He loves it. Especially exploding the bombs.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|Great game and looks even better on my Galaxy Note 2's 5.5&#34; screen. would highly recommend! Great way to pass the time.
B00A757EFW|2.0|the game freezes and goes faster than what you can control. tried several times to get the hang of it but the finger control is no good. joystick is needed.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While I zoomed through the first 2 books is 24 hours, this last book of the trilogy took me several weeks to read. I just was not into it, due to significant lack of action, and my frustration with the characters in general. It was still a good read, though left me a little confused at the end...
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A very serious topic (mental illness) was presented with truth, compassion and humor in a story that kept me intriqued and rooting for the main character, as well as, those surrounding him in his life situation.  Great, easy, enjoyable read.
0142418471|3.0|Wonderfully written with vibrant, believable characters. I loved this book right up until the very last chapter where it unfortunately, didn't quite do it for me.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with John Green's writing style will be able to tell which \\"Will Grayson\\" he was the writer of and which was written by David Leviathan. As with many other of John Green's characters, his Will Grayson and Tiny Cooper are both witty with a great amount of depth. I'm not as familiar with David Leviathan's works but his characters were darker in contrast but also very witty and well fleshed out. I thought that the joint venture was very well done and worked fantastically, something that many other combined projects fail at.<br /><br />I thought this was a great read but the ending fell very very flat for me.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Heart crushing, lust filled passionate story you can put down.Written with passion from start to finish. The story will leave you breathless.
B0095P27DE|5.0|Britney never fails to put on a great show! I saw her Circus Tour show and it was amazing and this one was just as good.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Good book. Nice easy reading. But the side story about how the coal mining industry has W Virginia in their pocket. How can humans who run these corporations care nothing for other humans. I don't live in USA but you need a new revolution and vote out governments that are &#34;fracking&#34; your countryside and killing us bottom people with pollution in the name of money. I'm not a conspiracy person. I didn't know about coal or fracking until recently
B008Q08580|2.0|This movie was okay. A little slow and not a lot of detail. Ryan Gosling did not shine like he usually does.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Five stars is not enough. Redemption,courage,faith,love and action. A great story about an imperfect person who succeeded because of the faith he had in God.
B0018RFLN0|4.0|It was very action packed!  I was surprised at who the villian was.I look forward to viewing all the Mission movies.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|No Easy Day was a page turner.  It made you feel as if you were on the mission. Mr. Owen delivered a exciting narrative to the operation that killed America's number one villain.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I had high hopes for the Life Proof case. It was certainly slimmer than my previous Otter Box case, and installing it was easy.<br />There was a small space between the screen and case that required a little more effort when typing - but not a big deal. When I tried to make a call, no one could hear me. I had to remove the case to make a call. Very disappointing.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Movie is very much worth watching. To see how a young man can follow his dreams or curiosities in life. It reminded me of my curiosities in my younger years. Sad it had to end like it did.
B000TEPIYA|5.0|This group was one of the best bands ever.  Shannon Hoon was also one of the greatest singers I've heard in a long time. Their music was totally different than the other bands that came out in their day and would have fit perfectly back in the sixties or seventies - the days of The Doors and Janis Joplin and such. Don't go by No Rain - that's their worst song - though very good. It paints not even a tip of the iceberg of what they can do and how well they do it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game and the graphics are great. Works great on my Kindle. There are a lot of activities to keep you entertained for hours.
B008Y1YFNU|4.0|its's true the creme always rises to the top. It may of took a while, but it was well worth the wait. Only a few of the &#34;rap&#34; rock bands still work the world stages. Survivalists to say the least., Still Standin' kicks total ass!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. It is my favorite game.It has daily challenges and you can play with your friends that have it. I would<br /> not only recommend it to all my friends but every one who is reading this.
B00004OCQ2|4.0|Great collection of not quite finished songs, by a band choke full of talent. Jake E. Lee really shines on this one. Ray Gillen's vocals while not completely finished and polished, are excellent. Bass and Drums are equally excellent. A little more output from a band whom I believe could've rivaled the best of the bands who emerged in the late 80's. A glimpse of could have been if Ray hadn't passed away, way to early,.............
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Best book ever really good!!! I can't wait to read the next one! So much better then the tv series
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|I love this game, but it can use some add ons, it is to slow paced for grown ups. Like more things to accomplish, and more ways TO earn money, and more things to purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the best apps for kindle fire, the only problem is that it is out dated. I don't think multiplayer works for kindle but other then that it is really fun!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Permissions? All cloud computing has privacy risk. Use a pad of paper and pencil locked in a safe if you are worried about violation of privacy.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I like being able to access You Tube videos whenever and where ever I want to.  It is a great entertainment feature and also for information videos.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is the  perfect mix of sexy , tears , love and above all the interesting world of BDSM
B009G41CG2|5.0|I gave it a 5 because when I play I can't put it down.<br />I have no deslikes.<br />I recommend to everone.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Proof is only as out reaching as the knowing we all have inside. When we venture onto to this physical realm we long for answers that are safely secure longing for the moment we open that awakening.<br />This beautiful timeless story will bring forth your answers and release your heart to the heavens shinning on the warmth and light reaching out as it did before like an old friend.<br />I myself have been here, gathering the wisdom of eternity. We think of ourself here is small and insignificant, so far from the truth. We are as vast as the universe and are as expansive as the light that unifies the love and soul that we are.<br />When you go to this place from here, you will know, when you open the door to your light, you will never experience anything in your life in darkness again.<br />The shift of consciousness to your inner light that connects the bridge to the spiritual world of grace is upon us.<br />If you want out of your misery, your sadness, your pain, your fear then read this book. We all are on our own path, but we are all moving together in the cosmic road to enlightenment.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|A good read.  Not an exceptional book, but not bad.  Not exactly what I expected- little detail about his sniping, more on the overall operations.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well written. Very good story line. Fine for young adults and adults alike. No worries about foul language nor inaproptiate situations.
B00BEL4P9Q|2.0|i was so exacited about ordering the Dvd season 3.Me and my husband couldn't wait to see it.we were disappointed and shocked about matthew death.I was disappointed and felt that i should be compensated for it.Would season 4 make me forget about Matthew?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thought this book was a little boring in the middle, but overall I'm surprised it didn't get more awards. This book is very sad and tragic, but even so I couldn't bring my eyes away. The true tragedy is that it didn't come out sooner.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This is a great movie! Very real and heartfelt! The acting is great, especially Emma Watson, she's dynamite. The movie is very true to real life, not quite so typical and unrealistic like most movies are. I am very glad I bought it, it's super good!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Wanted to have this in my movie collection. And I wanted the best possible visuals. Blu-ray was the only way to go for me.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|I have tens of thousands of color slides that I shot from 1970 to 2002, at which time I changed to digital photography. I've considered sending the slides to a scanning service, but the cost would be prohibitive, and I really don't need all of the slides scanned, just a select few hundred or so. So I'm using the DB-Tech scanner to scan the slides that I really want into digital.<br /><br />I was impressed with the performance of the little scanner. It was very easy to use right out of the box, the scanning itself takes only a second or so, and I got acceptable results using the default settings. I did not use the exposure adjustments on the scanner, preferring to adjust exposure and other properties in Photoshop instead. I can also edit the file names when I bring the slides into Photoshop.<br /><br />For testing, I used some newer Ektachrome slides with a lot of color, and some slides that were about forty years old with noticeable fading. The scanner did a nice job on them. I have no way to quantitatively measure the color depth of the scanned images, but the scanner was picking up some shadow detail, enough that could be manipulated in Photoshop, and the colors were true enough to the original slides. Overall, I'm very pleased with the DB-Tech scanner. For such a small, inexpensive device, it's remarkably fast and effective in converting slides to digital files. Note that I tested the scanner only with color slides. I did not have any film to test.<br /><br />The scanner does not include an SD card. I used a 4GB SDHC card that worked fine.<br /><br />A sample of the product was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This one movie more than launched the careers of just about every young actor or actress in it plus it was a pretty decent movie!<br />complete your collection by owning it!
0307352145|5.0|This book has a permanent place in my library.  I've already given it as gifts and recommended it to family and friends.  As an introvert myself, it is a delight to read descriptions and stories from someone who lives the life!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This novel was amazing. Their are no words to explain how you captured the characters and bring it altogether. Amazing amazing!!!!
B00BHMF578|4.0|I am not a fan of Ben Affleck and in this movie he did not disappointment me: he cannot act to save his life!  However, he is the director of this movie and he did an excellent job of it -- he needs to abandon being an actor and devote his time to directing.  The film is beautifully done with just the right [tense] atmosphere.  The characters and the sets are spot on in time -- the late 70's.  Enjoyed it.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This Star Trek series is the best of the best. Scott Bakula is a believable captain. The CGI done for this series was light years ahead of anything else on TV at that time. This rating I'm giving here is for the entire series, not just season one. I am not one for watching a movie multiple times but I have done so with a few. This will be the third time I've watched this series. A Star Trek series that good - well, you just have to watch it again.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|The story alone is mesmerizing.  But the magnificent, visually stunning piece of cinematography really takes it over the top. I only wish I could have experienced it in a theater. I was shocked when I saw the creative credits at the end (I don't think I've ever seen such an extensive list) but I completely understood that it took way more than a village to make this masterpiece! Can't wait to read the book now!!
B009X01D9U|5.0|I bought this after returning a belkin that I bought at Wally's World. It was $50 and not worth the price. This Marware is more substantial, but not too heavy. The price is so much better! The leather has a nice feel to it. What is really nice is that I can move from landscape to portrait. I am going to like this because I like to read in bed and prefer portrait. I was a little worried about the Kindle staying in the case, but I realized that I must push all four corners until I hear a snap. When you hear the snap, the device is securely in place. I am able to spin the device into position so that when the cover is closed, I can plug in the charging cord. I think this is a good value for the price. I am surprised I chose the wild orange color, but it's really fun.<br /><br />I want to add that in the photo it looks like the portrait position is not sitting in the center of the portfolio, but it actually centers perfectly.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really liked this book 3.5 stars. To be honest there wasn't much info on the story line so I did't know what I was getting into when reading it though I did scan for details. I have read both Slam and Point of Retreat so I am already familiar with Colleen Hoover and was excited to read more from her.<br /><br />It started off intriguing as I said I didn't know much about the story line. After the first couple of chapters I was fully hooked, but still didn't really understand where the story was going. The two main characters-Skye & Holder were great together, not to forget Skye's said best friend Six. the banter between Skye & Holder was terrific still not quite understanding what was going on in the story, but it had me hooked I didn't want to put it down.<br /><br />As we come to the main point of the story is where I sort of lose it, like Colleen's other books I feel they can be a little deep and this was more than deep it was sensitive and daring on her part, but she pulled it off and had me hooked to the point I really enjoyed having to guess what was going to happen next. I have to admit a different kind of love story, but with a total twist at the end.
B0095P3ULC|1.0|The movie wouldn't play steadily. I had to watch this on Netflix later.<br />An error kept popping up saying my internet connection wasn't fast enough to play the movie.<br />My internet connection was fine. I had watched movies before and after, and when I checked online with Amazon's customer service page, I more than all the minimum requirements.<br />This is the first time I've had problems streaming with Amazon, but it was awful. Every 10-15, the movie would stop and pop up the error message. I tried restarting the app, restarting my PS3, and no luck.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Sound City, in its purest essence, is sonic history and Grohl faithfully takes you along for the ride.<br /><br />The most stunning thing to see is the level of musicianship when they're laying down the music on the fly and how the guys (and gals) can adapt and s&#34;speak the language&#34; while getting the best of their takes committed to tape. Really honest and brave filmmaking...Oh, and the muusic is to die for, too!
B0011Z78R6|5.0|I love this album I got listen to the album I have 5 favorite song hotel California the new kid in town and many more
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The idea of the \\"mocking Jay\\" . And \\" THE GIRL ON FIRE\\"is brilliant ,she almost go insane but is able to pull her self back to gather in a heart warming way , and is great for kids teens alike!<br />It IS a great romance and a great book over all<br /><br />I HIGHLY  recommend this book, and hope that you do to.<br /><br />Report done by<br /><br />Kimberly Ann rose
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book makes me proud to be a woman. I appreciate Cheryl' s honesty in describing herself and her life. Well written....I didn't want it to end.  Happy trails Cheryl Strayed.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|I first saw the concert on Netflicks. It was riveting. To see tens of thousands of people packed into one of the largest soccer stadiums in the world was amazing. They played a great concert for being in their late 50's/early 60'. Even if you would not normally listen to this group, the concert is a visual experience in itself.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you belong to facebook this app is a must have on your mobile device. Very easy to use to connect to your facebook page.

B004UID2LC|3.0|If you enjoy watching you tube videos, check this app out. A pretty good selection of videos to choose from.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Amazon is doing a great job getting these great movies for rent! Keep up the good service and great selection.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I spend most of my time on EBay. If I'm not buying, I'm selling. It is an invaluable site for me
B00932A66Y|2.0|Somewhat interesting to watch moment by moment but there are so many holes in the plot, so many inexplicable actions, so many aspects that are just ridiculous--one wonders how it was able to be made in the first place.
B000077VR3|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite movies. It came in perfect condition and I was very happy with this product.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game so realistic in so many ways.I spend hours on my son's kindle while he's in school can't wait to compete at a higher level in the game.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|Unreal...  I would love to buy this but refuse to pay $10 more for a downloaded \\"file\\" when the printed, boxed paperback version is cheaper.  The publishers are robbing people.
0439023521|1.0|I hate this book it's a ripoff of battle royale and it so overrated don't waste your time reading this it gets worse every book people just say its popular because of the romance
B0052GACNM|3.0|While my favorites are not on this album, and though I don't consider it as good as his first Duets album, there are a few interesting songs here. The pairing of Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga is a real trip. I picture my parents listening to Tony Bennett when I was a kid and now my nieces and nephews listening to Lady Gaga. It's a mind-warp of sorts. Also, &#34;Don't Get Around Much Anymore&#34; with Michael Bublé is a good blend of voices, although I don't much care for that particular song.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoyed the wholesomeness of the drama.<br />It's too bad that BBC discontinued it. I would still<br />be watching episodes.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I'm always looking for new holiday songs and new twists on old ones, and Michael Bublé provides exactly that with this album. His &#34;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&#34; and &#34;White Christmas&#34; are wonderfully upbeat additions.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this game, it is very addicting! I would tell a friend to play. This game is very challenging at times though and very hard to play without a real remote control.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|If nothing else, this album will wake you up and get you out of your seat. From the old song &#34;Something's Got a Hold on Me&#34; to all of the newer productions like &#34;Tough Lover,&#34; &#34;But I Am a Good Girl,&#34; &#34;A Guy What Takes His Time,&#34; and &#34;Show Me How You Burlesque,&#34; this album sizzles!
B005GFPZYK|3.0|There is no doubt he's done great things for this country, and for that he has my thanks.  He's also done great things for other fallen hero's as well, with foundations and fundraisers.  I think if I was going to war I'd want him on my side.  It's just not a good book.<br /><br />I have no doubt that he had skills, but I was really disappointed with mostly his attitude.  The book is 75% about his bad-assness, 20% cliche's, and 5% worth reading.  But then again he was a SEAL not an writer.  They teach them how to fight not write.  Still if he'd had an editor or at least someone to review it who had more than a 7th grade English background it could have been a great book.<br /><br />R.I.P Chris Kyle.
1451629184|5.0|That's how long it took me to read this book. I could NOT put it down. This insanely true story is horrific, sad, captivating, inspiring, touching, tender, brutal, and incomprehensible. Minimally, it reminds us of the evil among us as well as the resilience of the human spirit.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The quality was excellent!! This is one of my husband's favorite movies, and he loves this version!! No annoying trailers either
B003YNFYD8|4.0|Oldies but goodies! One of the ways to get Hey Jude and a few other hit singles. There is also a detailed booklet. I just wish the CDs were in a more protected jewel case.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book soley to see why this book was so popular with women. Wow, is all I can say, I was totally shocked to say the least. The concept of the story-line was good, but the author seems to have a fixiation on Mr. Gray's index finger...what the hell is that all about? The author went way too far in her references to this &#34;digit&#34;. She must have made 100 references to this feature through this book, and I just about deleted this off my kindle 100 times, very iritating! So is this what women really fantasize about? I won't be wasting any more time with the other two books.
B00192IV9U|3.0|Any Michael Jackson fan must acquire this last album of original music. A few songs in particular, like &#34;Much Too Soon,&#34; &#34;Best of Joy,&#34; and &#34;Hold My Hand&#34; are gems. Most of the remaining songs seem like fillers to me, but what can you expect from someone who is no longer with us to provide new content.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use app to find weather conditions for places of interest. Provides 15 day forecast, current hour by hour forecast, and even pictures of ski slopes.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very interesting and thought-provoking - makes you want to read more about the people in the silos.  Imagine living like that........
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I really like the story.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is not because of the story line, but because of the grammatical errors, syntax and some words just were just incorrect.  It was like I was reading draft instead of a final copy.  Spell and grammar check would have caught alot of them.  I have read all three books. I am looking forward to the next book.<br /><br />DSF
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Excellent writing and acting...characters and storyline kept me coming back for more... especially enjoyed seeing the characters change and mature.... Walter Bishop's character in particular continued to surprise...<br /><br />....I'm currently on my 5th episode of season two, which is just as good.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I am not a movie buff but was formerly in Aviation, and I now work with those in crisis in social work literacy. I was astounded by how NOT formulaic this film was! I usually will shy away from 'flying' movies or anything about 'addiction' due to my lifetime vocational saturation! I was drawn to this film because Denzel has so few vehicles for his incredible talent. This did not disappoint and the theme sat fine with me ... it was dealt with so well - and with the kind of humor that comes ONLY from a full appreciation of the absurdity of life. I am very glad I took the (rare) time to see this. The story will stick with me in the same ilk as films like \\"Crash\\" ... (such writing that depicts men with truth - in all their soulful humanness, there are just too few, in any medium.) Five Stars for Denzel. Speechless.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I remember watching it on t.v.  It's a great show to watch if you are a science fiction fan. There is no cons to this.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This DVD was purchased as a Christmas gift and was very well received.  This DVD was purchased along with several others.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Loved this app until it updated the last time. Now it forces a close EVERY TIME I'm on. Please fix it!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This DVD was purchased as a Christmas gift and was very well received.  This DVD was purchased along with several others.
B007ZBWJXI|2.0|The only thing that stands out about this album is the artwork and the sound. The band sounds as fresh as ever, as if they were frozen in time for 30 years. So you gotta give them credit for it. Vocally and instrumentally these guys are at the top of their game. But alas, that's all there is to praise.<br /><br />The songs are devoid of the inspiration of their first album and its follow up, Alpha. They are just going through the motions, without any originality. Some songs are pretty boring, others are quite good but either ruined by clumsy lyrics, or songwriting that seems to end up in a broom closet (otherwise known as a dead end).<br /><br />You get some lame solos from Steve Howe here and there, nothing really interesting. No solos by Jeff Downes. No extravagant percussion work by Carl Palmer. No intricate interplay between the four. No aggressive and bombastic instrumental passages that made their first album such an exciting listen, and the second as well, to some extent (it was more catchy and song-oriented, but at least the songs were very good). You will never hear a song like Wildest Dreams, True Colors or Sole Survivor.<br /><br />The \\"companion\\" DVD is a joke. You can fall asleep listening to them discuss how they made the album, while some darkened studio footage is played in a portion of the screen. You don't really see them working in the studio. There is a beautiful video of the song that's supposed to be the hit single, I guess. It's a very boring song though, just going in circles (which can be said for much of the album - the songs are pretty repetitious). The dramatic moment is when the red umbrella drops from the bridge into the water below. Big deal.<br /><br />Those who crave recent music from Asia, are advised to save your money, and instead buy the \\"Fantasia Live In Tokyo\\" DVD and CD. This shows Asia at their best, playing their first and (some of the) second classic albums and quite a few surprises (prog-rock fans will enjoy a couple of prog covers, powerful playing and solos galore). Steve Howe delights the audience with a solo acoustic piece, and displays a sense of humor as he flashes the audience with the Union Jack inside his waistcoat. The taciturn Jeff Downes shows some humor as well, dressing up in a sparkly jacket and shades during \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\". Fans of Asia, prog-rock or 80's music will love this live set.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the ease at which I am able to get this program and watch it. Amazon continues to excel at their video on-demand product
1250012570|3.0|ELEANOR & PARK is not the witty and light-hearted read that I had expected it to be. Instead, it has trouble deciding whether it wants to be a charming romance or darker exploration into messed-up families. Either one would've worked for me, but straddling the two made for what was ultimately an unsatisfying read for me.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed watching Park and Eleanor's interactions unfold. They're an unexpected couple, and it was fun to watch them slowly begin to open up to one another. However, I wasn't convinced that Park and Eleanor's relationship endured realistically in their world. I ended up being more interested in Park and Eleanor's relationships with their families than their relationship with one another, and felt that one world seemed to always be intruding on the other, in terms of my understanding of each. After a while, I began to be more interested in reading about their interactions with their families, with the result that I felt confused about what the book wanted us to focus our attentions and interests on: the romance that initially sold the book, or the deeper but never thoroughly explored familial relationships that intrigued me more.<br /><br />ELEANOR & PARK was, for me, a temporarily touching but ultimately forgettable love story where the heavy-handed emphasis on romance crushed the subjectively more interesting aspects of the characters' lives, namely their relationships with their families.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really good love story hot and passionate. Couldn't put the book down. Lots of twists as you go through the story loved the hero
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Wasn't at all like I was expecting but a very gripping narrative.  I liked it because it didn't give you all the answers and let your imagination run wild.  Most unusual in that it skipped around so it was hard to follow at times but in the end this writing tactic worked.  I would highly recommend this book.
1884883303|5.0|I've been getting this book every year for years and, as a collector and player, I can safely say this i the best reference book there is to get realistic prices on guitars, ukes, amps, etc.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Bought this for my mom for Christmas.  I'm not super into Christmas movies but she likes it.  Arrived quickly and as expected.
B0060AY85C|4.0|I liked the characters but the story seemed to end suddenly.  I didn't get the point. I love Toni Morrison's work, I just don't know if this made the grade.
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|If you are over the age of 18, do not rent this movie (unless you are renting it for your teenage daughter).  I am not above pointless, glittery action movies but this was so full of cringe that I couldn't get through ten minutes of it.
B00846REIS|5.0|It took me awhile to get into this book, but I absolutely loved it in the end.  It is similar to 50 Shades of Grey, but much better.  The characters are a little more realistic, and the mystery factor was awesome.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Who doesn't love Downtown Abbey?  Every aspect of this show is beautiful, and the only downside is that by contrast the American shows I know so well seem really unsatisfactory.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was amazing.  I was so disappointed when I finished it and found out that the next one doesn't come out until June!
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|This game is hard to get through the levels, as it is a tilt game and does not have a whole lot of room to maneuver. But it's okay for a quick game while waiting for appt. or something.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|even better than Something Borrowed. Liked that it continued the story but from Darcy's point of view.<br />A must read!
B000002U8G|5.0|I'm 30 years old and my father used to play this album when I was a little girl. I grew up on great music thanks to my father's taste but this is by far the richest, most beautiful collection of music I have yet to hear in my life. I still get chills when I hear certain parts of each song. It's whimsical, deep, climatic, and amazing. It's strange to me that most people prefer Dark Side of the Moon, or have never heard of this album. Meddle is leaps and bounds above Dark Side of the Moon in my opinion.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Update is broken. I've been trying to update for quite a while now. Seems I'm not the only one with this problem. Only 2 stars
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|didn't want it to end. Very well written and so funny in parts. I would surely recommend. Most enjoyable read I've had in awhile.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well worth the read and I loved the discussions several of us had afterward about potential interpretations.  That's what you want in a good book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I was putting this on my PC and my android tablet, when I installed it on the tablet I thought I was going to have to use up more space to install a PDF reader.  Well Guess what this reads PDF's so all I can say is thank you and thanks for saving the room on my tablet
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was such a sweet story,that really made you think and opened my mind to a subject that I never knew about.
B000001FK3|5.0|This is a Great CD, I used to listen to it back in the 70's on an 8 track I have of it. I had to get it on CD so I can enjoy it again. It brings back a lot of Great memories.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is a great show. An easy watch. Serious in places, loving in places, and funny in others.just simple entertainment.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a good calculator and very easy to use.I was looking for one that had percent.So this was the one for me.<br />Thanks<br />ML
B004UPALT6|4.0|Always loved it! Especially the shot gun and the hand scene. Though the graphics aint that great the story line is good!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Of all American Idol contestant winners, he is the best since Carrie Underwood. His featured track &#34;Home&#34; that he played on Idol last year won me over immediately. I had been a fan of several other contestants, but once I heard that I was sold. &#34;The World From The Side Of The Moon&#34; is is soulful, thought provoking and exquisite. Every single song on this album is good, and some of them are on my favorite songs of all time list. I highly, highly recommend purchasing this album. Phillip Phillips has graduated to one of my favorite artists now.
B006O6F932|1.0|You really need to set this thing up on a table and glue every single joint. Otherwise, it just doesnt stand up to any kind of play at all. The furniture should also be glued together. Some items that should or could have been one piece are actually snap together meaning you should glue them as well. The kids think its great, but I don't because of all the glueing I am going to have to do. Otherwise its pretty neat to look at. I suggest putting it up on a table to be played with instead of using it as a portable toy. Not easy to fold and unfold.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really good game is better than anything else on my kindle cant believe its free really good game it's suitable for all ages and will amuse everyone
B0036SPOHC|4.0|I still think Fahrenheit is his sharpest work, but any Moore film is going to be about a topic of significance and worth watching!
B002NC8JEC|4.0|product was great but container had a big crack in it. It was a Christmas present so my sister in law returned it. other than that the cd is great!
1250027624|5.0|This book contains stellar photos as well as great behind-the-scenes shots from the beloved TV series. This makes a great gift to any Downton Abbey fan.
B000007XUQ|5.0|got this as a gift for my sister in law for Christmas and this is one of the best singers of all time. It's so nice to hear people who can actually sing
B008QTV3X0|1.0|I was never able to access this product despite 50 minutes of trying. comment by Amazon was to try another time. I should not be charged for this product. I don't hate the video; I never saw it !
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran, thank you for this book.  It was so funny and a great reminder that the women's movement hasn't gone anywhere.  I am so glad I didn't have to wait too long for Moranthology to follow.  I have read both books several times in the past 30 days.  I love them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!  It was the most sexiest book I've read in a long time. I recommend this book it will hold you in suspense from one page to the next.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  A page turner with many surprises.  Couldn't put it down.  I would recommend this book to all ages.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Nathan Fillion, always fun to watch, plays Rick Castle, a writer who shadows homicide detective Kate Beckett. This show is funny, full of action and overall fun to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My sister and I got this game bc we got a horse last Christmas and my sister thought we could get an app that could give us a little fun overview of what the responsibilities of caring for a horse would be like and I think this helped a little. It is also a very fun fun game we play like constantly! So very fun.
B008M7JODC|5.0|I am sad to see the series end on network television, but at least we have all 5 seasons on Amazon. I feel like this show was ended too soon - like Firefly. Many people compare this show to the X-Files, but I actually like it more than that series. I would not recommend allowing young kids to watch this show with you because it is definitely for adults (too gory for kids, in my opinion).
1400079144|2.0|Good:<br /><br />Made me want to visit D.C.<br />Good villain.<br />Source material must have been interesting.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />Langdon remains the blandest character ever. And it's starting to bug me.<br />Plot and pacing are miserable and repetitive.<br />Repetitive language (Who did the editing?). Also, too many lame character thoughts in italics.<br />The novel is about 4 times as long as the material and the story merits.<br />Crappy dialogue (Yup, here comes another history lecture.).<br />SPOILER<br />Practically every revelation is the same (It's all to do with the apotheosis of man.), and therefore not exciting.
0425263908|2.0|Perhaps I read this book too quickly after finishing the 50 Shades trilogy; but I was desperately searching for something to satisfy my yearning to continue on reading books with erotica, love, alpha-males, passion and intrigue.  It was just okay.  It didn't envelope me as a reader like Fifty Shades had.  The main characters were much weaker in their intended roles. The plot was much weaker, if present at all during most of the book.<br /><br />I'm sorry - I was prepared to love it; I just didn't.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|As a person who has enjoyed other books from this author, I can honestly say I liked this one as well. I would definitely recommend it for any age. It would especially be a good book to read aloud to children.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I started watching Season Three and needed to go back and watch One and Two.  This is the best show on TV.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have always wanted a horse! I like this game although I just wish the energy would fill up faster besides that very entertaining.
B002NT3B52|3.0|The book has some interesting info however, I find it a very hard read.  It is boring at times.  It does give you a different perspective on how a dog &#34;thinks&#34;, different from how we think.  I will finish reading it and probably understand my dog better.  I didn't expect it to be so much like a textbook.
B001XVP9CY|2.0|I had seen the TV version before and liked it. However, this one has a lot of graphic violence, nudity. Read the book. Good ending performance by Dolph Lundgren.
B00004YRQA|5.0|for a small item, it sure came in big package, it came on time n happy they shiped it, it works n it indeed is a ps2 memory card, awsome
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|This was fun. It alternated between dramatic and comedic - but never taking itself too seriously. Wish Eccleston could have stayed around longer.
B007JCP8FE|5.0|I already knew most of the songs on this album, and I just needed to download it before their concert for which we had tickets. Totally worth it!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|This may be the most perfect concert video ever released. The DTS HD Master 5.1 sound on the blu ray copy is absolutely amazing. No music fan should be without this in their collection.
B0099G3I96|5.0|I love No Doubt, and the price this was offered, there was no way I would pass it up. Thanks!
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|I bought this with the hopes I could make a video using it. It looks Kind of scratchy in person, (Just the way it was cut) but looks 10x better on camera anyway. Excellent for videos or cosplay!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book made sooo much sense of what I have experienced over the past 75 years,  my wife and I plan<br />to reduce our wheat intake to near zero.
B009A87Z6U|4.0|A must see for Bond afficionados.  An intriguing premise, with interesting characters and exotic locations, The movie has just the right amount of action and pyrotechnics.
8866130931|5.0|This planner has plenty of room for my ever growing &#34;to-do&#34; list as well as room for daily appointments and work schedules.It is a perfect size for my purse and come with some fun stickers to jazz it up a bit.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I went looking for something to watch with the end of Downton Abbey season 3 and found this treasure!  Wonderful storylines and great characters, I was sad to see it only went four seasons.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Just a regular beach read, no brain cells required! It is fun but nothing remotely stimulating. It's cheap though so it's ok.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Solid movie with the product meeting the expectations of the customer who received this.  Have put on our to check list when searching for movie products.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|If you are a fan of  film noir, watch this, it is great movie. The words \\"JAKE IT'S ONLY CHINA TOWN\\" will stay in your head along time.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Love this movie. It's an all time favorite of mine and the entire family.  I download it repeatedly.  Highly recommend
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I would like some music options., but gameplay was simple and intuitive. Fun puzzle game, similar to a rotating Mahjong.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|The characters are mythical, virtuous, and very love able. In a genera of imitators, where there is seldom a true original, this one shines out as a beacon of hope.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Mareware products are great they are durable and the hold the kindle tight in place quality material and great price
034580404X|5.0|I love it .. really enjoyed it so much .. recommend for people to read it .. very interesting books .. get your copies now ..
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Really fun game. My wife, children and I love this game. The graphics are fun and the instructions are easy to follow.
B00452VF4O|5.0|Very interesting - Historic part very well done - From the 1st page to the last is  captivating - I will read the second one -
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Wonderful album. So thrilled with my purchase. Very happy and satisfied with the music this band creates. Definitely would purchase again.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I got this game for my son and he loves it, but after you finish each level you have to purchase the next one, they are all 0.99 but in order for him to get them he has to bring home a B or higher on a test. So far it's been working.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I love puzzles and was excited to see one for kindle. I couldn't even get the pieces to rotate. Not fun.
B007R0WHMK|4.0|Super acting job by main character!!! Director well recreated the atmosphere of the book. Will recommend to many other friends!
B000FC2OHA|5.0|I have read some amazing books but this one is the best one I have ever read!! It only takes me 4 to 5 hrs to read a book but it took me 2 whole great wks because i would read then take notes! i didnt want to miss one word! i could have read it faster but didnt want too! It applies to all things in life whether your in business to the stay home mom! It's just an all round great book! If you read & apply these principles to your life they will work!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Just wow. Well written. Just amazing. It really shows how people who have not had trauma really don't unrest and that a trip to the mall or beach or even a bubble bath could be overwhelming for a traumatized person. This book can help a lot for families who adopt traumatized children. Be blessed
B007SGM084|5.0|If you are expecting to read the most wonderful book, well written and with an excellent plot, these aren´t your books.  These books are for me a &#34;placer culpable (guilty pleasure)&#34; and that is whatt I have to say. It is an erotic novel, yes that is true but also it is addictive, I read the 3 book in less than a week.  If you want to hav e a good and light time reading, go on, if not just don´t buy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Having been one of the first time I seen the movie before reading the book allowed the ability to identify the characters image in the book. The movie did a great job following the book but you can never get the depth perception that a good book will instill. I read all three books and didn't want to put them down. Wish they hadn't ended so soon. Great ending to the third book.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I know, I know it is very obvious but in this case I really do not care.  Jane Austen´s books are amazing and this movie has almost the same dialogues as the book, only a few changes in the characters but the plot remain the same and that is why I love it.  It is romantic, lovely, passionate and emotional, what else... ah, I love it.<br />In some part it is a little bit dark, but it only last a minute or so.<br />Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen did an excellent work.
B005HEPOKU|5.0|Great family show , many kids and teenagers watching for first time! Favorite series in the evening. It crosses all generations.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I have seen this movie a lot of times and I do not get tired.  Love Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullok and their performances.  Only at the beginning you can get a little bit tangled but then everything goes smoothly.  Great movie and I surely recomend it.
B000HZED8S|1.0|Horrible on so many levels. It's like they are not even trying to make a decent movie. It is an embarrassment to all the actors in it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Even though this book is a Nicholas Sparks creation and as I have read a lot of his work, or sometimes, seen the movie, I can more or less that to imagine waht is going to happen during and at the end of the story, but I have to recognize that the end really impressed me I was not expecting it, I am not going to tell you why, read it or watch the movie that is in theaters since february 14.
B001HBWY8M|5.0|It is a fun, carefree and entertaining movie. Don't be expecting the most creative plot, but it is enjoyable none the less.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|So far it seems real easy to use. I am a huge fan of the MS program OneNote, so I really can't wait to get into this! Thanks for creating such a cool app!
B002PHVAQY|5.0|At first I wasn't really sure what to expect from this little thing, but it really exceeded my expectations. I would absolutely recommend it to anybody else who would like a nice way to play guitar without upsetting those around you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My friend had this game on her I touch and I had a few games and I really enjoined it. Therefore I knew I had to get it as well. As it was free it was even better!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I love the price<br />Sound and picture was really good<br />Price was unbeaten<br />There are so many good collections that I will take advantage of it and recomend them too.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|it has a ton of suspense. don't know to expect in each chapter. not what I was expecting and the ghostly girl is randomly creepy as well. haven't finished but so far so good.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I saw this game and had to get it, it's a little hard to figure out where to launch the birds to shatter the right things and clear the level but it's a highly addictive game!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down. Nicholas Sparks has a way of telling a story that keeps you wanting to know what happens next right now!!
B004V5QWU2|1.0|I loved this app on my ANDROID but something happened in the translation. Please fix. I like the rain and thunder but they pause at the same time. Now on my Kindle.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I really enjoy these type of games. this one is cool but not scary. I could play this one at night time in the woods all alone and still not be scared. This is the best one for kindle fire, but not the best slender man game ever. I do recomend it tho.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is my 1st King book. He is an amazing writer. This is a well thought out time travel novel that awakened strong memories of my early teens.  I've always avoided gory fiction so this was a good intro to his writing. Highly recommend!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like this game so much. When I can't play minecraft on the PC I play this. It would be nice if it had infinite worlds, and caves, but it's still a great game. I play a lot. It's definitely worth the seven dollar's.
B004LROUNG|4.0|It was  a very good book for the beach.  I enjoyed it.  It was a fast read.  You should enjoy it.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Well directed and acted. Knowing the outcome in advance faded as the action absorbed me into the movie. I will recommend it to friends.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  Because it was about people in retirement and the problems and health issues that come with age.<br />I can relate.  It was a story of adventure and courage.
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|We are big fans of the show and cannot get enough of the music.  This is another fun CD to add to our collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I have friends that have watched Downton since it began. I watch so much other TV, I couldn't see taking on more. However, after feeling left out of the loop and folks having to tiptoe around giving spoilers away (since they were trying to talk me into watching it), I finally decided to catch it on-line. I am SO glad I did. I find it interesting to see how the two classes intermingle and how the bridge between them is closed by life events. Tragedy, happiness, fun, so many elements wrapped into one show. I love the little quips that &#34;Granny&#34; comes in with from time to time! Very well written and the cast seems to work well together.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Great CD - I'm already a fanatic about the music from the Lord of the Rings, so this fits right in with those CDs.
1400052181|5.0|Skloot raises various issues including research, health, ownership of human tissues and commercial advantage, and connects them to real people with real lives.  She avoids providing her own opinions and allows the reader to take in the information to consider.  The narrative is interesting and engaging presenting images of the difficult life of Henrietta and the current life of her descendants.
B009LHWEKW|5.0|This season is close to the best yet.  Sam and dean continue to  show their talent, continue to be interesting.  Although I'd live to see more episodes devoted to new monsters and challenges, this seasons plot proves much more palatable than season sevens  drudgery with Leviathan.  If you enjoyed early season three you'll love this seasons second half of shows, from episode ten on..
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is well written, acted and produced.<br />The show is for adults, no nudity or graphic violence, but adult topics and themes. Read: your 10 year old would be bored silly.
B00513DGIO|3.0|Early on the book Graeber had me hooked with some astounding pieces of information and superb insights on early history; he articulates an alternate and very plausible theory regarding the origins of current moral and economic paradigms:<br /><br />He proposes that \\"credit\\" occurs naturally in all human societies between the people comprising them, that credits forms moral obligations only vaguely appraised that bind those individuals as a community; he then goes on to distinguish it from \\"debt\\", which he defines in contrast as being precisely quantifiable, a byproduct of money (and ultimately of standing armies and war) that made it possible to reduce human relationships to impersonal arithmetic affairs.<br /><br />Once he starts to get philosophic tough, he ends up mixing too much of his political views with \\"history\\" and loosing objectivity to the detriment of his work, though I do agree that debt shouldn't be used as a moral gage and a that lot of the ideas he proposes seem worthy of further exploration and debate.<br /><br />The book is worth reading, the sections covering antiquity are superb, but there's definitely room for improvement: Graeber could sharpen his knowledge of contemporary economics (I'd advise to take what he's got to say on this matter with a grain of salt), condense some of the background information eliminating any biased comments, and expand a section expressing his views and reasoning before jumping to the book's conclusions.
B00942G4UA|4.0|This movie is a very good documentary. If you haven't seen it already you should. I really enjoyed it. Made me think about what I eat.
B00004YA66|4.0|Imagination is a wonderful thing. Being able to &#34;go back&#34; in time and right a wrong, change a decision.............WOW!<br />However, we can't, but the premise of the movie, good over evil is always good.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|A well written story.  I had a good time trying to figure out the ending; the actual ending surprised me.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as captivating as the first book but if you hold on, the story gets better.  In the beginning I felt like it was just a reincarnation of the first book, but it does build momentum towards the end.  After the last chapter I will definitely read the next book to find out what happens.
B000HZD0CS|5.0|I loved the way this movie unfolded, and I was saddened by the destruction of the Enterprise the first time I saw the movie. I'm hoping that cue from that scene can one day be available for online sale on MP3
B008LSAP9Y|5.0|This is the second of the classics restored by Universal in their monster collection and it is a gem of course.  I don't know how many times I've seen this great movie, but this Blu ray is certainly the highest quality.  Given a serious look, it's not quite the perfect horror movie I have forever thought but it's still close.  The best thing here is Boris Karloff, as Dr. Frankenstein's creation.  Watch his near mute (he does grunt and growl) performance.  Like many of the silent films a few years earlier, actors have to use their movement, their eyes and facial expression to communicate feelings.  And Karloff is masterful in this performance.  Can't say enough about him.<br /><br />Troubled actor Colin Clive is also excellent as Frankenstein.  Dwight Frey as Fritz and Edward Van Sloan return after their similar performances in \\"Dracula.\\"  The story of course is based on an early 19th century story by Mary Shelley.  All of this wouldn't have happened of course but for some great direction from James Whale and masterful makeup from Jack Pierce.  So what's wrong?  Quibbles admittedly but still.<br /><br />First when the monster is on the loose on day of the doc's wedding to lovely Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), Frankenstein thinks he hears the monster inside the house.  He gathers a search party of staffers and locks Elizabeth in her room \\"to keep her safe.\\"  Say what?  Of course, the creature enters though an open window.  Then there is the issue of the little Maria (Marilyn Harris) who is playfully tossed into the lake by her cottage by the creature.  Fortunately this once censured scene was rightfully restored.  Her father finds the girl (off camera) and marches into the village carrying her dead body claiming she had been murdered.  Huh?  Couldn't she just have drowned on her own?  And why did he teach her how to swim anyway?  Great sets, especially the flowing electricity in the laboratory, excellent acting and a timeless story overcome any shortcomings.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p resolution with a 1.35:1 aspect ratio. While perhaps not quite as sharp as \\"Dracula\\" the film is as good as its ever been. The original photography is well represented with little to complain about in terms of flicker, specks, and other video crud. If anything the picture appears a little too dark on rare occasion. These are minor picked nits and of little consequence. The audio comes courtesy of DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (2-channel) and while it is very good it does seem a bit noisier than the aforementioned \\"Dracula.\\" I don't know if this is the transfer or the condition of the original material.

B008HI7BMW|5.0|This music is very useful for imaging action scenes, especially &#34;Imagine the Fire&#34; I believe it's great music for timing a fight.
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|This is an above average ghost story in spite of some obvious silliness.  A true crime novelist (Ethan Hawke) who was a big success with his first book but not so much on 2 follow-ups is feeling the pressure to get out another hit.  He focuses on a small town in upstate New York and moves there with his wife (Juliet Rylance) and 2 children (Michael Hall D'Addario and Clare Foley).<br /><br />What he doesn't tell them is that they are actually moving into the house owned by a family of 5 that were summarily hanged in the back yard.  Well, all but one girl who was never found.  Things start to go bump in the night but only Ellison (Hawke) seems to notice.  Lured into the attic, he finds an 8 mm film projector and a handful of family film reels.  When he watches them he discovers typical family gatherings but the videos abruptly change to the brutal murders of each family dating back to 1966.  So what is the common element here?<br /><br />For help, Jack calls in a friendly sheriff deputy (James Ransone).  Strange things are happening with the kids too.  The boy sleepwalks and has terrible nightmares.  The girl draws on walls and has invisible relationships.  The movie is elevated by Hawke as he tries to tie the crimes together like a CSI investigator.  Unfortunately the film slips into traditional territory as Ellison sinks into looneyville and starts to see apparitions and one evil looking dude.  He finally sees the light and skedaddles out of their before it's too late.  Or is it?  Sure it sounds a bit familiar if you watch these kind of movies but this one is worth a look.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I am not an advocate for play guns but the kids love these.  They play games shooting at different objects and seeing who can aim the best.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|What a good read!  The characters are developed well, the story unfolds slowly at first, but picks up around the middle of the book.  I really felt very deeply for Lou, and for Will, and kept hoping for a better solution - but the ending couldn't have been anything different, and it was beautifully written.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|There aren't any glitches with this game and the graphics are really good! Best app ive bought so far with the Kindle Fire!
B0095P29EG|5.0|I'm a big Marvel fan. Movie was well done. Strayed a bit from comic book series, but I didn't mind. Can't wait to see sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a good game to play to pass time plus I like horses and its a good way to learn about horses
B007MDB71O|4.0|I like these kind of movies, I don't care that it did not do well at the box office, i liked it.
B009K0OL06|5.0|My Family loves this show.  We rented it so other members of the family could get caught up do date with the series.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i like because it wakes me up and it loud i<br />always have to wake up early and it helps
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I have always been a fan of the Sherlock Holmes books of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This movie is the second one made with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law and it does not disappoint. The action, intrigue and mystery are all there and it is well assembled to keep you guessing all the way to the end! I would highly recommend this movie, if you want a great thrill ride!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A great series of tales on a different type of war. Some of the stories were definitely better than others. Too bad the upcoming movie does not seems to take from what makes this read so good. Nevertheless, I'll still be watching it on opening weekend ;-)
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Full of unexpected twists and all the Jack Reacher brains &  Braun we love. A good quick read and most of the technical stuff is right.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Compared to the other 2 Daniel Craig Bond Movies, this was slow at times but it does an excellent job of showing Bond's history and why he is how he is in the movies we have seen over the years.  I cannot wait until the next movie.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|The book is a good read and very informative; whether or not your marriage is in trouble it good to know how to communicate with your spouse.
B009FZFONO|5.0|great series, just can't wait for the next episode to arrive.  it's the series that just keeps on giving more and more.
B009UNGYHG|4.0|This allows my ear piece to travel well and charges it, too. I love it and it fits in the briefcase nicely.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The reading was quite involved with many issues presented I hated the ending. So sorry I purchased, it was a waste of money.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I read this book as part of my book club. I really enjoyed it. It was completely different than I expected it to be.
B000JIN3J8|3.0|It could be due to the date of production, but I found the settings rather simple. I love the Austin stories, so liked the story anyway, just have found other productions more interesting.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|ha,ha,ha ! Great movie and special effects. It won't win an academy award but it is a good movie to watch at your &#34;man cave&#34;.<br />Good redone of the first total recall movie.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Ive played this game a lot since i got it and it teaches me how a little sickness becomes a big plague l. Its also just really fun and a good way to pass the time.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This was the 2-disc edition, so I definitely got the most &#34;bang for my buck&#34; with this product. Good stuff!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I bought this for my husband, he read it very quickly and had plenty to say afterwards! He said it was good.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Yes it is a long book, but who cares, you have already gotten this far in the series, there really is no turning back, and it is completely worth it.  The stories of all the characters are amazing.  Great book, great read!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|There is nothing I don't like about this game.  I'm 70, and I guess you could say this game is helping to wake up my eye/hand coordination, and memory (gotta remember where that particular block is).  I play everyday; would recommend this game to anyone, not just seniors.  I would like the individual blocks to be just a bit larger, but even that doesn't distract from my total enjoyment.  I have to play the &#34;Puzzle&#34; mode, since I'm not fast enough for the &#34;Speed&#34; mode....YET!  Actually, more enjoyable than I first anticipated.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Nice game,I think I'm going to spend a few hours to build the best city ever. Hope you'll have fun.
1451627289|5.0|This the BEST book I have ever read, period.I wanted to read it because King wrote it and I love his work. Totally nothing like any of his other works,but it is super great. as I stated before it is the best book,by anyone,that I have ever read..
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I was wonderful.  I had seen season 1 and 2. now I can't wait for season 4.  It transports me back to XX Century England.  If you like Jane Austin, you'll love this.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|it arrived in great shape, I recomend these guys to anyone. got here in good shape. say hi to you.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book.  It was hard to put the book down and do other tasks.  Write some more.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Great Movie, it has a lot to it.  Some comedy, Some Drama and definately some violence. I would recommend this movie to every one, except the kiddies.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This movies sucked from start to finish. I can hardly believe I watched the entire thing. It was that bad!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a great free game. Always having new things added. Keeps you occupied.I love this game.I can't wait to get to level fifty lol
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I hope the show continues for another 10 years. The acting is fantastic, in my humble opinion. Doc is amazing for his age.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This show has great pull-no-punches writing, top-notch lead actors, great soundtrack, intense personal drama with lots of twists and turns. Loved The Shield and this show is quite different in topic, but some of the same themes emerge. The &#34;good&#34; guys are not always so good. The &#34;bad&#34; guys adhere to their own moral code. Recommended if you like The Shield, Dexter, and the like.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Kevin is an outstanding actor and makes the show click in my opinion. If the series keeps going as it has so far it should be another FGox hit.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is just...amazing. I don't want to give away spoilers for any of his work, but...If you aren't reading this yet...START NOW!
B000FCK65W|5.0|Can't believe I've waited over 40 years to read this - but was it ever worth the wait! If you love a tale beautifully told then you just can't pass this up.
B00BESLT6G|2.0|Lacked drive, as the movie progressed the actors did not. The visuals were well done, the director lost track on how to scare his audience.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The automatic 16.9 screen resolution is excellent. The character acting in this series is also excellent. Star Trek lives on
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Streamed perfectly. Much better than first attempt. Not happy that Amazon is requiring such long ratings to accept them. Don't have anything else to say.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|This was a quick read packed with examples of how to succeed ignoring the roadblocks we all tend to create. I would recommend it to anyone interested in starting a business or working in a small company facing budget issues.
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|I like movies where your scare but thir is myth add to the story and the use of color in the film I thought was great to. I love the dad that out of pure love he vows to help in any way even if that mean anything nassarry which only a parental love and the love for you flesh and blood could you possibly understand that.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|It works well. Increased brightness by at least 5x and increased battery life too.  Feels cheap expecially the switch, but works.  If you have one of the mini mags I would definitely buy it.  You don't have to use the switch if you don't want.  You can still leave the original end cap use twist on/off.
B001FAFO3W|4.0|I really enjoy films so when the Vhs of this whore out as types do I was sad, so when the dvd came out I was thrilled to be able to have it again and the story keeps you coming back for more no matter what age you are.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got it and I lllllllloooooovvvvveeeddd it until I wanted to play it and it just went back to the home screen
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I love books I read a the time no matter what it is and I never read this as a kid and everyone had said how great it was so now this reader is off to Kanses.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|So I really loved book 1 but book 2, pandemonium was so much better. Lena is more developed, more mature, strong. The plot is great and you can see things to start and showcase the struggle in society. I really liked bringing in Julian and like the hint of the triangle in the future! This is a fast read ( well at least for me it went by fast). I couldn't put this one down!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Even thought its just as much as any vegas movies or vegas reads, I still love this book. Love at first sight and people who know before hand what they want and whats expected of each other in a relationship, ensures that life does not get complicated, and yes the evitable break up to make up<br /><br />I would definately reccommend this book.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Great product. only issue is the adverts inside are all UK Based. so the special Disney Promo stuff can't be redeemed
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|The acting was superb.  It was a beautiful treatment of a sensitive subject.  Helen Hunt was excellent and not at all mindful of her nudity.
B004XWLN20|5.0|This series is great. I just wish there were more seasons of this show. Personally if you like anything superman you most likely like this series.
086547897X|5.0|This have all you need to know to beging your carrer of animatior all the basic things are all in here
B009PJXY3M|5.0|got this for my daughter and she plays it all the time.  just loves the music and who sings it
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I enjoyed the step by step instructions on how to format your book for Kindle. I know that there is a separate book for Mac users but would have liked to have seen some of those tips within this book. I also liked the section on Before You Write. Overall, very concise and informative guide. Will recommend it to others.
B0013D6LEM|4.0|I like the music on this album.  it is great to exercise with and the  songs are easy to dance to
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I really I enjoy it so I can get up for school its FREE its WORTH it! ! if u want something good for Fred this would be the one!!!!! :-)
B005HED11Y|5.0|The HD episodes are truly works of art. The enhancements make viewing TOS a new adventure.  I highly recommend Amazon Prime.
B00785P2QC|4.0|after the collapse of the Weimar republic it really left the gate open for Hindenburg. Due to a misjudged move of allowing a certain fanatical young politician into the Reichstag (for Hindenburg to keep an eye on him) we soon had the 'machtergreifung'. This Lead on to laws being passed contrary to the constitution. Long story short next thing third Reich then #kony2012
B004HD61KE|4.0|Good story but got a little draggy with details.  Toward the middle you just wanted everything to be over.  I've rad several of the authors books and liked them all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game made. I play it almost every day and I don't play any other games except temple run. Thanks!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have the Pc verson and I cant play it so this is all I got<br />mojang really needs to add buckets and boats
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a selection made by my book group, and I'm certainly glad it was chosen! From one moment to the next, I never knew what was around the corner. Great book!!!!
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|After reading The Hunger Games Series four times, I decided to give some new series a try. So I moved onto Divergent and now Delirium. I loved the story and the world the author created with such great detail. She makes everything seem so real and vivid, even down to the excerpts from the society's books and theologies. The only thing that I didn't like is how Lena's, the main character, thoughts tend to be very long winded, to the point where she's describing things and I often forgot what she was talking about in the first place. Other than that, it's a good book and a compelling story.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I HAVE READ ALL 3 BOOKS TWICE!!!!...GREAT READ!!!..WAS SORRY TO SEE IT END..I ENJOYED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS TRILOGY!!..CHARACTERS KEPT ME SPELLBOUND, ESPECIALLY MR CHRISTIAN GREY
B000NV55RY|3.0|It is a funny and entertaining movie but I think the age has made it les appealing than when it first showed.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This is a fine movie, hard to watch in some respects, but it seems to be a fine representation of actual historical events.
0345803485|4.0|Look, forget the fairytale elements and unrealistic, over the top soapy bits. I tried not to read this because of the craze, but eventually picked it up and plowed through the series in a week. Many criticize the writing and how Christian is basically every girl's dream man. Cool, everyone has their opinion. But you must realize that this is a book written from the perspective of an insecure, innocent 21/22 year old girl, so of course it will read that way. And if these things bother you, remember that being intimately from her individual perspective-we really don't know if the character has exaggerated, misconstrued, or overlooked certain aspects(if that makes you feel better). I actually liked this, and how we are given her inner dialogue, which at many times mirrored my own after what i had just read. It makes it more relatable.<br /><br />  And I do not think Christian is every woman's dream guy- well maybe from a mile away. But an overbearing, obsessive, sadist, control freak who truly believes he is s*** is not the type of guy I seek out, no matter how pretty he is. I also like this about the book though; it takes a stereotype 'perfect guy' and rips him to shreds then glues him back together, still beautiful but marked with imperfections. It is a very sad and kind of beautiful love story (even though it all happens lightning fast). These two very different people both fall in love for the first time and both feel undeserving of the others love(though Christian feels undeserving of anyone's love).<br /><br />  I think it is an easy read that is good for other 20somethings because it gives you the juicy sappy love(to a degree) that we women love, but it is also very thought provoking and while it screams tragedy, it is ultimately hopeful and uplifting. Everyone deserves to love and to be loved.<br /><br />i would encourage you to not listen to the criticisms and make up your own mind about the book :)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Having had a British mother, and having visited Great Britain on many occasions, I was curious about this series.  It is quite well done on all levels - the acting superb, the story lines intriguing and Maggie Smith has got to be one of the most wonderful comic actors on the planet!  Her one liners and expressions alone would be enough for me to continue watching.  One wonders how true any of this might be to the realities of life during those times.  And whatever that might have been, this series is so very entertaining that one is simply taken in again and again.  Delightful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the most fun game ever. I played all night it's a lot like temple run hope you buy this
B003XYERRM|5.0|By far my favorite book by Sharon Penman. Read it by accident way back when and instantly fell in love and proceeded to read everything she wrote!! Anxiously awaiting her next book!!! Have read it over and over and still cry with rage how Richard was treated at the end!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book was wonderful.  I enjoyed it from front to back. Although a bit wordy is some places, it was a really good read.
B00452VF4O|5.0|Must admit i first did not like it. But thank goodness i read it again and love it now!! Simon and Nell were way before there time!!!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|It is a really good read and I got to see the movie not long after I had finished reading it. Took a while to get started on the book but soon got into it.
B000FC12SM|5.0|It is so funny but so real, help a lot at list to laugh of things that some times make me mad....
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Come on, how can you go wrong with Indiana Jones?! Well, except for the 4th one; I don't know what his fascination with aliens is, but, whatever. Great movies!
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|We enjoyed watching this movie as a family.  It is interesting to see how different movies from that time period are as compared with today's movies.
B000TNF7OC|5.0|when Every Song on an ALBUM/CD is quality material... N' you don't have to jump around to find a good tune... NOT on this ... AWESOME
B00BESM14U|4.0|I loved this movie.  Great storyline, great characters, very real.  I may have cried a bit, it was definitely a poignant story. I would watch it again.
B009VB97EY|3.0|On a whim I decided to watch this film.  Dancing is great but the language has too many &#34;f&#34; bombs.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|It shows what the White House is doing to this great Nations of ours. It shows that the people will find out.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Even though this is from a women's point of view, I occasionally like to watch action films.  This particular film I think humanizes the the Bond character.  You are guaranteed nonstop action & Daniel Craig is not bad on the eyes.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like to check on the weather all the time and this is great for showing present and up coming weather with details
0399157565|5.0|I have read all of the Scarpetta books and they are all just as good as the first one. Book arrived when promised and I can't wait for another one to come out.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The story is what makes this movie so good.  Otherwise it's average and I would have given it 3 stars.  There could have been more character development but I guess the story is the focus.
B0042MDAL8|5.0|Fast delivery. Read all the books and loved them. Wanted to upgrade from DVD to BLU Ray. A must have for anyone who likes the Twilight saga.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|I gave the movie 4 stars mainly because this movie was different than most other movies in its story line.  I enjoyed venturing into the world of men entertaining women sexually when mostly its portrayed in the opposite light.
B002ZG9774|4.0|I have this on DVD and wanted to upgrade to BLU RAY. Good movie. It arrived before the approximate ship date.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I won't be summarizing the season itself, I'll just say that it's great and is a wonderful follow up to the amazing first season.  The contents of this Blu-ray/DVD combo pack are great!  Not only do you get the high quality blu-ray version with a plethora of special features, but this also comes with the entire season on DVD as well as a code for the digital copy.  That's an amazing deal, especially considering there have been times when I've hoped to watch certain movies/shows but I only have a dvd player available and since not all Blu-rays are offered in a combo pack I don't have copies that will work everywhere.  This solves that problem, which is great for people that have multiple tv's but only one blu-ray player or perhaps people that have dvd players at work and are allowed to bring in entertainment while on shift.  I have noticed that some people have complained about not recieving the code for the digital copy.  I did notice that the portion of the package that houses the dvd's also has &#34;& digital copy&#34; printed on it, yet the code was located inside the blu-ray disc package with the rest of the paper booklets and advertising that accompanies this set.  I don't know if that is the case with the other reviewers or not, but I definitely recieved a code to download the digital copy.  The picture and sound on the blu-ray copy are first rate and it is a really enjoyable viewing experience on your home theater.  Highly recommend.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|The concept of this show is very compelling if you like science fiction.  This show is good clean entertainment for the whole family. Rumpelstiltsken is perhaps the most interesting character on the show and is defintely one of the corner stones to its success. We started watching season 1 on Netfilx, then picked up the missing season 2 episodes on Amazon Prime. We are now all caught up and have it set on the DVR.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great. My 5 year old daughter loves horses and can't have one where we live. This allows her to have and take care of horses that are all her own.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great story, great sex, I love a good love story. I cant wait for the next one to come out. I enjoyed reading the first two.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Enjoyed every aspect of the book. Easy read. Loved the insights from his wife as they added an insight not found in a lot of books.<br />Lots of info. about what went on in Iraq,it is good to hear what really went on from those who were there. Hope they all<br />know that the majority of us support and appreciate what they did and do for us.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES.PAUL NEWMAN AT HIS BEST.IT'S ABOUT A MAN WHO IS A LOST SOUL AND KNOWS NOT WHAT DIRECTION TO GO IN.WHEN HIS MOTHER DIES HE QUESTIONS HIS BELIEF IN GOD.AFTER TAKING A BEATING  AND STILL GETTING BACK UP,ALL OF THE OTHER PRISONERS LEARN TO RESPECT AND LOOK UP TO HIM WHICH HE'S NOT WANTING..ONE OF THE MEMORABLE LINES.&#34;WHAT WE GOT HERE, IS A FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE&#34;!
B007SGM084|5.0|No more going from store to store trying to find each book when you purchase the packaged trilogy set.  Plus you save on gas, trying to find all of the books.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|A GREAT HISTORY HOW A SCOTISH MAN COMING FROM A POOR HARD WORKING FAMILY WITH A FATHER WHO WAS RESPECTED FOR HIS BATTLEHARD STANCE FOR FIGHTING FOR COUNTRY AND NOT FAME OR MONEY.THIS IS INSTILLED IN HIS YOUNGEST SON WHO IS THE ONLY ONE TO SURVIVE IN HIS FAMILY.HE HAD A DEEP HATE IN HIM FOR THE BRITISH.WHEN THE SCOTS WERE FALLING APART AND SCARED WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE BRITS HAD THEM OUT NUMBERED,HE INSTILLED IN THE HIS LOVE OF HIS COUNTRY!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Likes swinging  on vines & when u get the diamond you get to try again.  You get new people and specials
B004UPANGM|5.0|There are some films that simply embody what a horror movie should embody.  It has the hero, the other, and the world itself.  Evil Dead 2 has all of this and more.  First things first, don't think that you're going to be watching something made my Michael Bay.  ED2 was fairly low budget.  That said Bruce Campbell helped drive the movie along.  Bruce's acting, Sam's directing and story, and you have something to be proud of.  This middle child of the Evil Dead Trilogy deserves much more than just being seen as a simple horror movie.  It's a cult classic, and a damned good one.<br /><br />There are iconic scenes from the movie that just stick with you.  The severed hand, Deadite Henretta, and of course the creation of the chainsaw hand.<br /><br />Awesome movie, and deserves to be watched.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I like this game to pass time, a matching game that unfolds from the top to the bottom.  I also like that you can shuffle if you want to uncover more tiles (unlike some where you are just done).  It is very much like the version I have on my desk top; even though the Kindle version is smaller to view, I like the portability of having it on my Kindle.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Excellent book, and what would be a good accompaniment with this is &#34;Monday's with my Old Pastor&#34;, this one was a tear jerker as well. good read, and helps to digest the issues of life and death. Mitch wrote this very well. a classic for sure.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I am addicted to spider solitaire.  I have even played while watching television.  Especially if no one is on line to play words with friends.
B00000251N|5.0|Love this and gave it as a gift to a dear friend who just love this to death. This made a great gift..
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|Although this is a pretty typical horror movie, the acting is great and there are a few surprises that keep you guessing.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great read. An intimate look into the world of assassins and their life. David baldacci did not disappoint. Edge of your seat reading.
B009X01FJS|4.0|easy to get my fire in and out with out much diffuclty and that no flaps to make it picture scape.  oh yeah the best that it rotates
B006O6F932|5.0|It was opened but from what I can tell it was new and all part in container, and my little girl will love it on her birthday..
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Great set from the Eagles with stellar video and audio quality!  I echo the other reviews that mention the mix is pristine and very immersive. Elliot Scheiner's mixes are always great and this disc is a must have addition to any music fans collection.. A++ recommendation
B007R0WHMK|2.0|An interesting movie that I needed to watch until the end.  Not sure that it is something I would watch again though.
B009BJATYS|4.0|Love this version of Emma. Well cast, true to the book and beautiful to watch. My preteen and I watched it together and both enjoyed it.
B000FC12SM|5.0|I wish I had read this entire book many years ago.  It explains so many things about how and why men and women act and react the way they do.  This should be required reading in school as it would help in all our personal and professional relationships!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is a good clean game for chess, no ads, it gives you the ability to set the up the difficulty levels, can play different player modes, my 6yr old loves it. I got it installed on my kindle fire.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Fun read I have read other books from the Reacher series wanted to find out how he started out. The book  seemed to end very quickly.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Absolutely the worst film in the series. I didn't even bother to pause when going to the kitchen for a beverage.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great quick read!  Funny little love story.  What happens in Vegas does not always stay in Vegas!  Good story line.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|The parts barely fit together. I didn't expect it to be really sturdy, but I did expect it to last long enough to actually take a picture with my phone.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the best most intense book I have ever read!!! I'm so sad I did not want it to end :(
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Silly fun, expertly done. While this isn't new ground, and there are no great surprises this is still worth a watch if you are a fan.
B0000028M7|5.0|Sorrowful,wonderful are a couple of words that barely scratch the surface of this album, especially in trying to describe Layne Staleys Vocals.
B00633W614|5.0|Like a historical novel. Events of the past brought forward impacting future events. It was a novel I had a hard time putting down. The outcome was not obvious.
B004WGIXX4|4.0|This is a funny movie - I watched it streaming and it played mostly OK, had to restarts a couple of times.
B007SGM084|4.0|so much easier to read a book, dont have to worry about folding the pages or anything ripping and the best thing is that you have a virtual bookmark that always holds its place
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|When a friend told me about SOA, I laughed. I thought I would never watch, let alone enjoy, a show about an outlaw biker gang. I watched one episode, and I'm hooked. The three main characters are amazing actors. The show is edgy, a little gross at times, but electrifying, and definitely entertaining. I finish each episode, look at the clock, and think, ' do I have time to watch one more'?
B000068FWC|5.0|Great Album from my youth.  Missed having it in my collection.  It is great having it to listen to again.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Great movie; love the music!<br /><br />Is it me, or Kaa goes through a face lift during the movie? In his first scenes he resembles a python serpent all right. But afterwards he gets completely redesigned and ends up looking more like ...Daffy Duck!<br />Dethhhhhhhhhspicable!
B000009HF2|5.0|Missed having it in my collection. It is great being able to listen to it again.  Been a long time since I had this to listen to.
B008Y6TD5A|4.0|I liked the story because it was intriguing to try to figure out what was going to happen. Happily the plot was not entirely predictable. The movie was professional with first-class acting and production. I thought the story developed too slowly, but nevertheless it was entertaining, I found myself wanting to see what would happen. My wife, on the other hand, got bored with it and stopped watching it. I think that there was not enough action for her. It was really more about the mental state of the people involved. Some of the actors were stilted which detracted from the movie, but I thought that was a directing flaw because these are generally good actors. Overall, I think the movie is better for people who enjoy the psychological aspects ind interactions of people. If you are looking for a shoot-em up, this is not for you.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked reading this book.  The relationship of Travis and Abby is what kept me reading.  Some things were a little annoying, like the other guy Abby was \\"dating\\" (his character was so useless I don't even remember his name!).  But in the end, I liked seeing how their relationship found a happy ending
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great (true) story from inside the teams of some of the greatest warriors on this earth!<br />R.I.P. Chris Kyle
B009VLX8FS|4.0|This record is definitely Taylor Swift's pop crossover platform, which is why I am confused that it is still categorized as Country... Anyways, a lot of these songs are really catchy, and I really like her duets here. It's a different sound, definitely more Pop, but still a nice album for her fans.<br /><br />For non-Taylor fans, I still think &#34;The Last Time&#34; is a great song. She sings it with the lead singer of Snow Patrol and it's something that I feel appeals to more people than her tween crowd.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Loved it from beginning to end. Daniel Craig is a whole new type of Bond, rough around the edges and more brute force than savvy, but his on screen presence keeps you tied to the film. Highly recommend!
B006H5120E|5.0|This review is just for the 3D conversion, which I loved. I'm no expert on the matter, but just from the way I saw it, I thought the depth was great. Very few scenes with pop-out effects, with the only one I can remember being from when a gun is shot into water and it splashes out a little. However, I believe that the 3D really enhanced this movie. It's even better than films &#34;natively&#34; shot in 3D like the Amazing Spider-Man. Highly recommended
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Portions of the film seemed to be reaching to far to tip my emotions, but Denzel is remarkable as he carries this film providing great insight into the troubled and challenged mind of an alcoholic.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|It was a good second half always keeping me on my toes! It j/ needed something........more!<br />Can't wait for book 3!!!!!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This E book is fantastic. It was free on my phone which is convenient. I love the classic tales of Sherlock Holmes. It is nice to pick up when I only have a few moments here and there because of the short story format.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun game. Better than the first. More streamlined upgrade system. The death images are not as fun as the first.
0470913029|5.0|This is a great book. I bought a copy for myself and a friend. The Paleo Diet is a genius plan for healthy eating and living. It is well organized and easy to read. It came in the appropriate time and in good condition.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|The fourth part of the Bourne series has the toughest task in the previous part. The Bourne Ultimatum simply can not be surpassed. Good job, but Matt Damon was a world class hero.
B004TI5N38|4.0|love mysteries. hard to put down. recommend to anyone who loves mysteries. great book to curl up with on rainy cold day
B000I5SY5U|5.0|One of Bob Fosse's great works. Wonderful undercurrents of tension. \\"Life is a cabaret, old chum?\\" Chicago is close second. But \\"All That Jazz \\" is my favorite.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I purchased Chris's book after hearing of his passing. Normally I don't buy books that way. In this case I am glad I did buy his book. When I started reading it, it held my attention that I couldn't put it down. There were a couple of places that he mentions in the book were where a family member of mine was at the same time Chris and his team were there. Upon reading those parts I began to cry because like Chris said he was protecting them and saving them. Well he protected my brother and his men. I am grateful his service as well as  all of the other men and women.  I would recommend this book to any who want know what over there from a soilders point of view. Thank you.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|I love this Blu Ray. It Came in quick! I look forward to buying more in the future! Thanks for that!
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Very strong content. Looking at life through an alcoholic and the denial that goes with the disease even when all could be lost. Powerful.
B007REW8DO|5.0|I enjoyed this CD; the lyrics were excellent and her voice is very angelic! She is very beautiful person as well.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Maybe traffic gets a bit heavy on Saturday nights but we sometimes get a herkey-jerkey &#34;stuttering&#34; stream. This also happens whenever we have to stop watching a program and try continuing later.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book (and the two that follow it.) My advise is to just go ahead and buy all three - you'll be glad you did.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Her voice is amazing, her song writing skills are excellant.<br />Her story telling & audience interface are well received.<br />The only con - her language - it cheapens her craft.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Diana Gabaldon continues to impress!  I am so in love with this Outlander series.  I know several people who are reading and they love it too.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is a well written account of this Seals story.  I found it very detailed and interesting. I bought this on my Kindle and it is a very hard to put down read. I do not care for bad language in my reading but  I do understand the circumstances and places where it is used.Plus it was not over done like so many orher written works.  I was somewhat disturbed about his view of killing, however that is the reason he was in the place and it was all about his training and patrotism. I do and have recomended this to many people.<br />I should have given this a five star rating just because he was a Texan!<br />J.W.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These books are awesome. My only complaint is that I am sad it is over! I definitely recommend these books.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|What can I say about a fantastic writer?  I love a good mystery and Baldacci sure fits the bill.  Keeps you interested from the first page to the last.  A must read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love these books!I saw the movie Hunger Games before reading the books - something I don't usually do. But in this case the movie just made me hunger for more!!!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I read this book in one day...could not put it down.  Love the books where you want to get to the end of the story, but then again, you do not want it to end.  This is one of them!  Spellbinding!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is yet another great book in the Outlander series. Thank you so much Diana Gabaldon - I love all your books.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Definitely recommend this book.  It is another Grisham success!  Keeps you reveted until the end!  Been reading Grisham for years and hope to do so for many more!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Any Zepp is good. I liked the quality of the recording of the dvd, cd was ok, sound was not quiet up to par. The concert was great.. Packaging was little over board, could've cut a little bit of the price but the set is a must own if you are a ZEPPELIN freak...
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I used this for some gaming and for my HTPC. This chip is the best if you are building a budget system. Plays a lot of games at medium-high settings with no other gpu. I recently used Tera online to test. Low setting gives 60 fps. Medium gives around 40 fps. This was on 1920x1080 resolution. High gives 20-25 fps. You can always get a gpu later on if you want better graphics and gameplay.<br /><br />My Build:<br />This chip<br />Asrock FM2A85X Extreme6<br />Corsair Low Profile 1866mhz 2x4mb<br />Coolmaster Hyper 212 Evo<br />Corsair 650w TX Power supply<br />Coolmaster Storm Scout 2 case<br />Window 7 premium Oem
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this controller for my brother for Christmas and he loves it. He goes through controllers like he goes through underwear so he was pleased with this product.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I put off watching Dr. Who for the longest time.  And now I am so mad at myself that I did.  It's an extremely well written and entertaining show.  Excellent choice for anyone into the Sci-Fi and supernatural genre.
B0023S50DO|4.0|It's just another one of those unrealistic, action laden, breathtaking movie.  He loves all that kind of stuff, you know?
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The first season was riveting and jaw dropping. Asylum was disturbing, and, oh so, very worth it. Zachary Quinto, Jessica Lange, and Sarah Paulson all were amazing characters.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|The credits list Ridley Scott for good reason. The premise of human life stemming from &#34;off world&#34; sources is not new but this movie tells it well. The FX are perfect, the story is easy to follow, the Aliens tie-in is not too obvious but definately intact.<br /><br />I liked all the Alien(s) films so it follows that I enjoyed this one too.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|If you like sci-fi, futuristic type books, then I believe you'll enjoy this one. The writing was good and the story line stayed consistently interesting. I never once was bored with it.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|Ashton Kutcher as a sex buddy! Just think about that for a second; now think about Natalie Portman as his partner who does not want to be attached in any way except for on-call nookie! It's funny.
B000002MNL|5.0|I've never known what to consider Morrissey's music style, always safely gone with alternative pop. Vauxhall and I is pure pop full of catchy tunes and sing-a-long lyrics.
B003M70O5O|3.0|The series is fantastic - however the connection with Amazon Prime leaves a LOT to be desired.  Their server just doesn't deliver enough bandwidth.  I have a very fast internet connection and the best router money can buy and I still can't get a good connection.  I have recently switched to Netflix and find it to be very superior in all respects.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I love Hugh Grant and Toni Collete. They both did great job acting in this movie, and so did the little boy. Great story line.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this as a spare cord.  Not that I really needed it but thought it would be a good idea.<br /><br />I have had no problems with the one I received with my Kindle Fire HD.  I use it all the time.  I just thought I would buy and additional one in case I could not find one of them.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|The instruments on this album are very powerful. With her voice on top of those instruments, she has stolen the show.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I needed an alarm clock that had multiple alarms. This one hit the bill. I have set 5 different times on it. Only problem I had was being able to choose a specific alarm type. I contacted their web site and they wee very helpful. I would recommend this app to everyone.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire was a fine story. I loved The Hunger Games and definitely wanted it to take a different turn. Still read this if you're reading The Hunger Games. You must finish the trilogy.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I saw the PBS special and went looking for the album, I hope he does more in this vein.  Very laid back, enjoyable and memorable tunes.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|What a cute movie. The claymation was done so well. Gotta love Tim Burton films. Coraline was such a great character.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I used it for a month and lost some weight and gained some much loved muscle definition!<br />It has 3 levels for beginners to experts.<br />For the price why not try it?<br /><br />Remember to buy some hand weights though because they are not included.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Sorry John Green fans, but I think he's an absolute moron. His writing was fine, and the book was pretty decent. He said some pretty stupid, sexist things in his narrative. Always find it odd to be reading a narrative of a teenage girl written by a middle aged man. But maybe that's just me.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Very well done film.  Great action scenes, believable for the most part.  Quality acting and good character development.  I will take Bourne series of 007 all day.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|This is a very cute movie with all very great actors. I laughed and cried. It was a very fun story.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I rarely give anything a 5 star.  Going into this I knew all about the story line, so I was prepared to be knowingly unphased because there wouldn't be any surprises.  Turns out, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, yelling at the TV like some knucklehead kid at the movie Theater watching a horror film.  Excellent job with the set to make every last detail from the 1970s.  I took notice of everything and couldnt find a single misplaced prop, from the carpets to the phone, to the lamp to the kitchen backsplash, to name a few.  Acting and casting were very good.  Highly recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Hunger Games was 5 stars.<br />Catching Fire was 4 stars.<br />Mockingjay gets 3 stars.<br />I wanted the book to go in a completely different direction. I appreciated the resolve at the end of the trilogy, but it was a long and treacherous journey to get there.
B004BDJS9Q|4.0|My kid read all the books and thought it would be fun to watch. Although he said it wasn't exact it was good.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I love how these &#34;insert&#34; into your ears...  the sound is delivered INTO your ears and not near them.  Especially good on plane flights where you can never hear anything.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I couldn't put this down! This book definitely had me so involved I felt like I was as part of this family. Working in law enforcement, I felt the author did a great job of describing the court proceedings in an accurate manner. Highly recommended!
B00932A66Y|4.0|Just watch it, you won't regret it.<br />Nice, intriguing, even funny, and with a well developed story.<br />Highly recommend it.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! ANYONE WHO LOVES MUSICALS WILL GREATLY ENJOY THIS FILM AND PERFORMANCE DONE BY THESE VERY TALENTED ACTORS!
B0030ZRW9E|5.0|She is a fantastic writer. I have probably read all of her books at least twice.<br /><br />She is one of the masters of mystery writing and in my opinion, the best.<br /><br />I like the historical significance of the time and place of this story. It is post WORLD WAR 1 England,  the main characters Tommy and Tuppence, meet after being apart for several years and learn they are both struggling to find meaningful employment. Tommy had been a soldier and Tuppence a nurse during the war. In this book you share the experience of living through this period of time with a humorous, adventurous, and intelligent young couple as they embark on solving a mystery.<br />Agatha Christie writes mysteries that keep you guessing &#34;who has done what&#34; and even though they are of a certain time period, the characters are timeless. Read this book and you will find yourself embarking on your own quest.<br />Acquiring more Agatha Christie mysteries.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|What a totally original story! I was sorry for the book to end. But who won the game after all?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and addictive the only suggestion I have is I would like to design my own character that's it! That's it, GREAT GAME!!!!
0345803493|3.0|I didn't like the first book in the series that well, but for some reason decided to power on and read the second one. While the second book is not great, it keep me reading until it was finished. I don't know if it was because I just wanted to know what would happen next, or just I have a problem starting a book and not finishing it.<br /><br />Christian is very, very (I could say very a million more times, and it probably still wouldn't be enough....) possessive of Ana. It's insane some of the stuff he gets mad about. I would never put up with a crazy person like that, but apparently Ana will. And another thing is he's rich, yes we get it. No need to go through that point all the time.<br /><br />I will go on to the next book, just to see how the story ends. It won't be a series that I will re read. It's just not that good. Too much like Twilight, too much of a crazy person and the writing isn't that great.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|this book by Grisham had some nice twists and turns that were totally unexpected which lead to a good novel to read on vacation. I would recommend this book...
0937381888|5.0|This is a perfect book for those who really want to know how to make beer. Well explained and straight forward.
B004LROUNG|3.0|if that's a word..  was okay, not exciting by any means as I thought a Grisham novel would be.  Just a daily grind for a lazy group of lawyers and went on way too long in a court case.  Wouldn't buy it again..  ended like I figured it would end when I started reading it..
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book. I could not put it down. But when I got to the ending I was very disappointed in it. I actually said out loud &#34;that's it&#34;????? But for the rest of her book she really kept her facts straight. I would read more of her books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's not often that I would say that the movie is so much better but in this case Nicholas Sparks has delivered what only can be described as a masterpiece of romance.
B001XUPH9K|4.0|I like view Star trek movies, especially The Wrath of Khan.  This movie has a very good story.  However, I do which Amazon would provide the extended version that was shown on tv some years back.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|My sister told me about this. This is an excellent story...who can you trust?<br />Kevin Bacon as a wounded man...with bad people digging into those wounds (psychologically and physically)...is brilliant.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I cant stop playing this I have a huge kingdom. that sounded nerdy but trust me I'm not a nerd I'm hot lol
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was a very good story.  So enjoyable to read a novel that focuses on a relationship and how people can change and grow.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is fun to try to beat your score and shop for stuff for ur person so I gljust think it is pretty and fun also a mottling challenging
B0048LPRCS|5.0|This director has something to show us.  It's done without a lot of soundtrack music.  It's more internal, more getting into the life of the main character.  Seeing things from his point of view.  Or from an omniscient observer's point.  Captures the tangled web of causal networks around an event, an event like narc-ing on someone.  This film is an invitation to see the true complexity in every event.  Also, you have to view it more as life than as a movie.  All the lines are not explicitly clearly enunciated.  There is stuff that just passes by, like in life.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Loved watching this series after so many years, brings me back to my teen years.  Stories are sill relevant today!
030759565X|5.0|As an avid cook and baker and somewhat of a cookbook collector, I love this book! It has everything you want in a cookbook: interesting recipes which will make you want start cooking immediately, good pictures (I'm always so disappointed when you don't have a picture with the recipe...I do want to see how it's supposed to look like at the end!), and Deb Perelman's stories are entertaining. Above all, I love these 2 things: the fact that she is mindful of how many dishes will need to be cleaned so that if it is not necessary, you won't have to wash that extra bowl; and the fact that since she knows that not everybody owns or wants to go hunting for that super rare spice that you will likely never use again, she keeps the ingredients simple without compromising on taste. My favorite recipes so far are the apple cake and the snicker doodle squares. Both were a huge hit!
B00ATCVA4O|5.0|Any fan of 80's and 90's glam rock will get a great dose of guitars, riffs, and power vocals...just good, fun rock!!
B0093Q9SCS|4.0|Sad, but a great movie. Original plot. Tear-jerker! I hope to have a loving, thoughtful, and creative husband one day.
B000FBFMZ2|4.0|It was a good read. Lots of character interaction and a sophisticated plot. The only real issue with the is that the tech was not presented in consistent fashion, something many sci fi writers trip over. Being a techie, I am we'll versed in how systems work in convert in a given age. Two hundred years into the future would have tech considerably more advanced then what was expressed here. Be as it may, it still works well as an adventure involving a flawed but worthwhile human being. Nuffield said.
B00BLGZX5O|5.0|Im not going to write a long review. And i am not going to compare it to novels or as in one review that actually got four stars,  talk about how much carnage there is, and how long it will take for some sick person to copy what they see on tv?  This is what everyone is giving 4 stars for?  The story is about a guy who is a genius.  He has a cult.  \\"The Following\\"......Kevin Bacon a once, I think FBI agent, left the force, and was called back to help catch this guy and bring him in. But just cause he is in jail, doesn't mean his cult is not fully planned and doing as instructed. The force with Bacon's help is trying to solve all these bad things that keep coming up all through great planning of this psychopath.....In short Im sure we all have seen something like this in a movie at some point. But as for tv?  I think it's fresh, and Bacon and im sorry i don't remember his real name (the bad guy in jail), he is just amazing and perfect for this role. could not get any better than him. All the acting in this is First class all the way.  Very entertaining. This show will last as long as Bacon stays on. It's a six year contract. So if you like action, police shows, a little bit of cult thrown at you, then i think you will love this show. It's actually a rush. It moves fast when it needs to, and slows up for really intense moments. You really get to enjoy each scene. Great writing i think.  It is certainly worth at least watching the first two episodes to see if you like it.  My only complaint, is i wish they allowed Bacon a little more room to act.  Meaning to open up just a little. I understand he has a rough past, but allow him character to let one of the agents closer to him even a little. It will also allow Bacon to use more of his acting skills.  Great show.  I hope they don't take it off the air......5 stars all the way.
B0015AARJI|5.0|its a controller and it works great thats all i have to say but they still want more words so i can hit submit
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If you like musicals then you will love this movie. This movie had my laughing its diffently a chick flick. I would add this to my movie<br />collection.
B000IYUIPK|5.0|Except for some language issues this is a very good movie for couples. Mark's mannerisms of today (NCIS) are already evident. Connery and Harmon interact very well and throw in a very good supporting cast to go with a good storyline; and you have a very good night at the movies.
B00A7GWG3Q|5.0|as beautiful, relaxed and yet compelling as ever.  They never let you down. From the jams to the little gems - winners all.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|My son loved this movie.  Very entertaining!  Good story, and funny for all ages, well worth the low rental price, and you get it for 48 hours!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Very well done.  Affleck didn't have to add drama to the real story, in my opinion.  The real story was enough.  But he did a heck of a job.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fabulous, want more!!! Waited until I had all episodes downloaded then watched the whole season at once. A wonderful series being watched all over the world.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|I really can't say how it works<br />as it would not download to my<br />kindle fire...so It was a waste of time<br />and money
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good reading, but not quit what I expected.  Expected more information in the respect to sniper activity.<br /><br />Otherwise good reading material.
B003OUXECE|5.0|I love the games and the book really ties them together but the book might be a little confusing to someone who hasn't played either of the games
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This will be a great convenience for me as I almost always have my android phone with me and it is not alfways convenient to carry a book or books.  I like the ability to change to different translations,  I teach Bible-related health topics in a homeless shelter and need the quick access to information.
B008F5YDRI|1.0|This video kept stopping and shutting off.  Who do I contact to receive a refund.  My ROKU player is brand new so it's not my player.  Also, I have no trouble getting Netflix, HULU Plus and VUDU.
B009AP2G26|5.0|The whole season was amazing! It had its ups and downs but it was definitely worth the purchase! Can't wait to see more!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I like the use of far oput science in each episode. I really like the characters. Walter is a hoot.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Had heard that it was a wonderful book full of twists and turns.  It was, but it didn't even get interesting until halfway through and then the end was just insulting.
0805092919|5.0|The repetition and artwork engage my little one in such a way that she reads this book to ME.  :-D  I found this book at her development center and it's great.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I loved this book so much! This sequel to Delirium could not have been more perfect. The only reason I give this book 4 stars and not 5, is because it is very vulgar. Lots and Lots of cussing. Beware!
0439813786|4.0|In a previous review, I had lauded G.P. Taylor for creating a compelling format for storytelling with his graphic novel and novel hybrid Dopple Ganger series. Well, I must also credit Brian Selznick for his imaginative story telling through word and picture as evidenced by The Invention of Hugo Cabret and Wonderstruck (and his other books, I suspect). Selznick captures the curiosity and innocence of youth in each of these books. The stories progress masterfully, bouncing between pages filled with words and pages adorned with vivid illustrations. (And, if a picture is worth a thousand words, these books have more to read than a Stephen King novel.)<br /><br />Hugo - which is now a movie - explores similar themes addressed by the Taylor series by following a young boy abandoned in a sense by the deaths of his parents and guardians looking for his purpose and place in the world. His penchant for mechanical repair offers him some guidance but it's not until he steps away from the life he knows and takes a series of risks, that his identity truly solidifies. And the journey is worth the read.<br /><br />We learn about trust and fear and belonging. Selznick shows the importance of learning our history and shaping our future. Underscoring each storyline is the concept of relationships and the need for community. There's a lot to learn from these \\"picture\\" books.<br /><br />- from TRudATmusic[dot]com[slash]raw 2/27/13
B003TQKVGU|3.0|I got a lot of innformation out of it. But I need to read one more time too review more of it. Hard to understand the first time.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|levels are fun and scene is amazing but I beat it in one day they could of added more to last a little longer
B004MKLRQA|4.0|I like it because it's an interesting story. No I don't really compare much. I still have it since it got it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Very good story for any type of reader, not just military. Everyone  should read a story of survival like this.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|There are enough reviews for this movie, therefore, I am not add another one.  The quality of streaming, however, was very poor.  I expected an HD streaming as the original movie is a Blu-ray DVD.  Amazon's was standard definition, in fact it was worse than standard definition.  I will never download a movie that did not say HD from now on.
B00005Q66T|5.0|I can tell you that I will love this as I do love madonna and most all her music .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator will do just about anything you need to do.  It is great for everyday use.  Very simple to use.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Thought it was well made - casting, editing, acting all good and story was excellent. I wondered toward the end if things were that close in reality.  Made for a pretty good 'edge of seater'.  I did not think this movie was Oscar Worthy - I enjoy Ben Affleck movies but thought his role in this lacked some depth.  I'm sure he played the role very stiff and straight intentionally but for me that was distracting and a bit unreal.  The movie did want me to find out more about what happened and make me more interested in the subject.  I know it is a great story but I worry about the timing also on something like this as a movie like Argo can exacerbate an otherwise mild conflict.  Someone is trying to make a conflict with Iran to give the US/UN an excuse to move in and there are good people on both sides of the pond that would otherwise get along.
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|Alanis Morissette has a beautiful, unique voice and this was my first album years ago on cassette.  I love that she's digital now she lives on my iPod, the whole album does, not many do.

B001UGB1X8|5.0|great movie, would recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a good thriller. Tommy Lee Jones is great as always
B0084B5TK8|4.0|Many out there that have only seen the movie and never touched the book are missing out on the brilliance that is this novel.  Presented as a chronological compilation of journals and documents written by the different characters, this book accomplishes a level of closeness between the reader and the cast unseen in other works of fiction.<br /><br />Beyond that, the engaging story, with well delivered mystery and thrills, will keep most readers flipping through its pages.<br /><br />The Audible book is a pleasure to listen to as every character is read by a different actor, really fleshing them out.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|I immediately loved the uptempo rockabilly songs and Tainted Love.  The slower songs all grew on me.  This album has a higher energy feel than Love Tatoo and a more sophisticated sound.  Highly recommended.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Purchased this because of the amazing reviews here on amazon. And I will have to agree with them.<br /><br />The first workout wasn't what I was expecting. Kind of expected to feel dead by the end of it rather than feeling energized and ready for more. Lol<br />Its over before you know it!<br /><br />I'm not in the worst shape, but then again I'm active duty military,  so I kind of have to<br />Stay in decent shape.<br />I bought some 3 lb weights to go with it. I think I need 5lb weights when I start level 2.<br /><br />That being said, I'm still a weakling and hate doing exercise. Running is my enemy. Lol<br /><br />Level one of this video is a great way to start. It will keep your ego up while you build back strength and energy that you lost from being lazy for a year.<br />Level 2 will probably kick my ass. And I'm looking forward to it :)<br /><br />I bought this with the yoga meltdown so I could alternate days so I wouldn't get tired of doing the SAME thing everyday.<br />I will try the YM tomorrow. It gets pretty good reviews as well.
B001HOF8AA|4.0|I bought Mayhem first and I would say I like Mayhem better.  That being said, I really like Imelda May and like just about everything she has done.  Love Tatoo may be more accessible for people who like something that is a little lower energy and more traditional.  The rockabilly tracks on Mayhem really rip.  I like the cover photo on Love Tatoo.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Ok, let me start by saying that I always seem to assume young adult means college age, not high school age. So I get young adult books and then realize they were really written for teenagers. So I am trying to review this from the perspective that it was written for a teenager. That being said, let me also state that if you are looking for something sexy and erotic at all, this is most definitely not it. If you are looking for a clean romance for your teenager, you might be onto something here. **Spoiler Alert** Skip to next paragraph if you don't want to read** They don't have sex until they are married in the second book, and even then it is nothing that is described.<br /><br />The book really started out good.  I am not usually a fan of teacher/student romances (although I love professor/student romances, but that is an entirely different story).  I liked how this book incorporated the teacher/student romance. They met and fell in love BEFORE they realized they were teacher and student, and he was not way older than her. Although because of this, it was not exactly believable either. I hate the love at first sight crap. Attraction at first sight? Ok, love it. But I hate the idea that two people, especially this young, are pretty much in love after seeing each other one time and knowing nothing about each other. Second, I found it unbelievable that he was a teacher so young or that he was a student teacher teaching his own class while waiting to graduate (while waiting on certification? Maybe. But not while waiting to graduate).<br /><br />I thought after the first little bit and initial conflict that the book slowed down some, especially after the big reveal about Lake's mother.  I also felt the ending was kind of sudden and was glad there was a sequel (which I liked less).  It was definitely not a page turner, and after a while the lyrics and the poems kind of got a little old. I also found Lake to be a very immature character. Granted she was 18, but I was more mature than that at 18 (and I was not the most mature 18-year-old).<br /><br />Overall, the book would be ok for teenagers I guess because it is clean, although I do not like teenagers reading a lot of love at first sight stuff and thinking that is how it is supposed to be.  If you are an adult, I say pass. It is just a little too juvenile.e mature than that at 18 (and I was not the most mature 18-year-old).<br /><br />Overall, the book would be ok for teenagers I guess because it is clean, although I do not like teenagers reading a lot of love at first sight stuff and thinking that is how it is supposed to be.

B008BDZOZY|3.0|I was hoping that David Byrne was back, but I found the album uneven at best.  I actually liked the St. Vincent songs better.  I can't really recommend it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Strayed shares the good, the bad, and the pain in this beautiful memoir. A great read for hikers and hiker wannabees. It's telling when one doesn't want the story to end.
B0000508U6|3.0|This album has a few stand out songs, but mostly sounds like the work of a band that has not yet hit its stride.
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|John Hawkes overcame unbelieveable difficulties to experience the 'completeness' of life...that (in my opinion) being love. Love not only of the women in his life, but also of himself.
B000UFAURI|4.0|E,S,P, &G is my favorite of the 3 FF albums I have.  It has a nice mix of hard driving rock and some softer songs.  There is relatively little screaming as compared to Colour & the Shape.  Even the hard rocking songs are melodic.  The finale, Home, is a beautiful ballad that I found myself listening to over and over.  The opener, The Pretender, is also a standout, with power and grace.  This album  maintains its momentum with only one weak spot for me, the uninspired Erase Replace.  This album is a battle horse which holds up to repeated high volume plays while racing down the highway.  Enjoy.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I like thise watch.it is very very good end very beautiful.my friends tells to me what it is very nice.they like it very very much

0736092269|5.0|I bought this book a few years ago when I decided I wanted to start getting in better shape and that I wanted to incorporate strength/resistance training in that effort. This book is so thorough and easy to read that I was able to get the knowledge I needed to make the changes I was after.  I didn't use this book alone. I used it in conjunction with Bill Phillips Body for Life program.  I used this book to formulate/design the workouts that I would do each day for Body for Life. There are so many exercises, with pictures, that just flipping through the book will give you ideas on ways to mix up your workout.  Want more information? Just read the info and side bars and you'll learn what muscles the exercises work, how to maintain proper form to maximize effort and minimize injury, AND best of all, the author will detail alternative ways to do the exercise for people who only have access to dumbells, or barbells or cable machines. This book is not snobby and doesn't treat machines with disdain. It simply references the way to effectively exercise each muscle and group. I keep it handy while I'm working out so that I can freshen up on exercises I've not done for a while or for when I just want to try something new.
B00027JYLC|5.0|Its a cult classic that everyone must have in their collection. Great for kids learning not to be a bully, or being bullied.

1439170916|4.0|I'm usually not drawn to conventional medical books but this was an excellent read. As a Harvard Med School graduate ... the brilliant author is fully indoctrinated (brainwashed) in conventional medicine's slash/burn/poison method of treating cancer. I was surprised he didn't mention spontaneous remission/Ralph Moss/Ayurveda/Traditional Chinese Medicine or other alternative treatments such as the Gerson Diet ... if only to refute them. He does provide a terrifying glimpse into a mummy's sarcoma and Atossa's mysterious breast cancer as well as detailed summaries of Cisplatin/Gleevec/Herceptin's discoveries. His patients' stories are clinically interesting but left me dry eyed.<br /><br />This is a fascinating (albeit disorganized and verbose) book but the underlying message is disturbing: even today's sophisticated drugs cannot guarantee survival and there's no cure on the horizon because cancer's mutations are too numerous to continually target with molecular therapies. This material view is quite pessimistic and is fatal for the patient.<br /><br />In the past 2 yrs I've known three patients (different types of cancer) and they all had one thing in common ... relinquishing all power  to their &#34;expert&#34; oncologists and not realizing that cancer is more than a physical problem. They are all //dead// now. I recommend  &#34;Chemotherapy Heals Cancer And The World Is Flat&#34; for a more cutting edge and helpful explanation of cancer's actual //meaning// Dont be a victim of conventional medicine's &#34;treat the symptoms&#34; approach.

B00AU15HPC|5.0|So pleased with this latest solo release from Justin Hayward, who, along with The Moody Blues, pretty much has been most of the soundtrack to my life.  In Spirits of the Western Sky he is ever the poet, with a touch of personal-sounding sadness to some of the lyrics in some of the tracks.  Did his wife die? Did they split up after all these years?  His personal life has always been such an enigma, except through the lovely music that comes out of him.  His voice is just as rich, just as dreamy.  I loved the country feel to a couple of the tracks!  What a nice surprise!  I think if ever I could say anything to him personally it would simply be a heartfelt &#34;Thank You&#34; for the musical richness he has added to our world.<br /><br />Can you tell I highly recommend this CD?  :)
B00A861QMM|2.0|Not your usual great g5 game.  This one has a lame story.  The graphics are high quality, but the hidden objects are very hard to find, such looking for gems the size of a period and partially hidden.  I had to use help a lot.  I do very well with these games, but this one is impossible.<br /><br />Not recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I hate to read just about anything. This book really kept my attention. Its a little graphic, but has a great story line. I'm actually on the 3rd book.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very interesting and entertaining.  Ben Affleck is also a very talented director.  The ratings by the majority viewers also concur.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is #2 of 3. I love the story line in these book.  keeps you guessing whats next in the 3rd on.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Great movie.  I really enjoyed it.  Action sequences that I did not expect.<br />The screenwriter has done some real crap movies in the past (Looking at you Star Trek: Nemesis).  He has apparently upped his game.<br /><br />I felt bad that I only had time to watch the movie once in the 24 hour window.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I've been on a little kick with his novels. None of them are going to change your life and they're a little slow to start but it's overall a good read and will suck you in be the end.
B001JYEMOQ|1.0|My wife (39) and I both hated this movie, not to mention it somehow made my 6 month old son cry long and hard.  We had to pause and put him to sleep before continuing this disgusting movie in hopes of the ugly and gay Matt Damon getting caught SPOILER (WHICH NEVER HAPPENS, BTW).  Don't hold your breath for that good ending.<br /><br />Just as a lie requires another lie to cover up the previous lie, this movie shows that a murder requires another murder (and a third, implied, murder) to cover up the previous murder.  This is basically Cain and Able.  If I wanted to read/watch a story such as this, I'd read the Bible.<br /><br />If you liked this movie, you are sick as hell and headed there as well.  Go repent you moronic fools - or as the muslims would call you \\"infidels\\".
1563890410|5.0|This is one of my favorites of the Sandman Chronicles, it's art isn't as good as it is in The Wake, but the characters are any and very dimensional. You will love this along with many of the other Graphic Novels in this series.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I bought this because I had heard the IZ version of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" in two or three movies.  IZ had such a great voice, so sad he passed away at the young age of 38. I can't say I like ALL the songs on the CD but just the same I will probably try another different one of his CD's. His voice is truly mesmerizing.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book is really good at some parts but boring. It doesn't get good until the middle of the book.
B008I6ZX1E|5.0|Good quality.  Prompt service.  I actually purchased these for my son.  He was thrilled to get a set in hardback.  The movie version is good if you give it a chance.  It starts out seeming like a horror movie but it isn't.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I have read the books on this series a dozen times and I love the movies and they just keep getting better.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love critical thinking games and games that offer a challenge. This game is fun and thought-provoking. When I first started the game, I was rolling along until I got to bigger boards that required more thought.
B007BFSYMS|3.0|I forgot I even had it as an app.  It has some interesting options and it may come in handy but it's not something I have used on a regular basis.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun the only problem is that it's really addicting! I do think you should vet this game.
B00932DCS8|3.0|I did not like the fact it had subtitles, made it hard to keep up with at times, plenty of twist and turns but overall it was ok, it had its moments!
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|I ordered the DVD and the video streaming came free with purchase of the DVD.  DVD arrived fast during the Christmas Holidays.  Very fast shipping no problems at all.  Thanks, My son loves this movie
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I really loved this film. The thing about &#34;art&#34; films is that sometimes nothing really happens but interesting camera angles. This has a great story and is funny, but it grabs your heart and leaves you with plenty to think about. Jim Carrey does a fantastic job showing a man dealing with the fact that the life he thought was real, isn't, and the occasional glimpses we get into the TV crew and the worldwide audience as the story unfolds are spot on. The soundtrack is PERFECT. A very well done film that my teen/tween children and I could all enjoy and talk about afterwards.
0345803493|1.0|FOR THE LOVERS:<br /><br />Oh yes...this is the best book ever. An AMAZING read. WOW. AMAZING. WOW. AMAZING. WOW. AMAZING. Totally for you. The main character is sooooo relatable. Just you wait, as you too will have a man like Christian Grey who will tell you all day to eat eat eat. In fact, most of your conversations will begin with him checking on you to make sure you've eaten. And if you haven't, he'll have his house maid cook you a huge pile of fat laden pancakes. And when you don't eat for two days, you will loose five pounds..because you are a magical goddess.<br /><br />You will never have to be financially responsible because your friends are rich and their parents buy them fabulous apartments in all the cities of the world you'd like to live in. When you need it, you can drive your best friends fancy Mercedes and wear her designer clothes until the man of your dreams comes along and chooses expensive clothes for you and writes cheques for stylish cars.<br /><br />Don't ever bother to comb your hair before you fall asleep wet on it every night, as one day the most handsome man in the world will come along and rescue you and pay for you to go to the salon every day.<br /><br />You've made it through university and escaped ever having to use a computer or open an email address because professors these days LOVE wading through hundreds of handwritten papers. Having zero computer experience is no bar to getting a job in a publishing house in a major city during the recession. Your totally hot man will solve your problems by showering you with all the latest electronic gadgets. Ipads, Blackberries, lap tops show up at your home with amazing regularity.<br /><br />Even though you don't comb your hair, wash your clothing, fall down all the time, hate exercise, have no particular talents other than sighing-every hot powerful man who sees you, wants you. From your boss, to wealthiest man on the planet, to your hot, successful art friend, to the bosses son...they all want you.<br /><br />Just because you are a naive ingenue, doesn't mean you won't have deep insights into the psychological problems of one of the wealthiest, most powerful men on the planet. You have incredible intuition and can make the leap between the fact that the hottest man on the planet is interested in solving world hunger and is into domination because his mother was a \\"crack whore\\". All it will take is the deep love and devotion that his previous 15 submissives did not have. Of course, you are smarter and more beautiful than they are. Only you can straighten this out.<br /><br />All of the above aside, you aren't some \\"ho\\"! You have a dignified, respectable INNER GODDESS who has kept you chaste. When you enter this relationship with the most sought after man on the planet, you will be a virgin! And as a virgin you will sit back, be tied down, and just enjoy all the pleasure without having to do a thing.<br /><br />In short-you don't have to participate in life at all. It will all work out and you will be amazingly gorgeous, wealthy and sexually satisfied without having done anything in your life whatsoever.<br /><br />FOR PEOPLE WITH TASTE:<br /><br />I didn't like the first book, but wondered if the second might get better. Surely not ALL the good reviews are computer generated fakes. Nope. I laughed when I read that the second book in this trilogy started up two days after the first one ended! WOW...that's real suspense. That was an intense break up. The only decisive action Ana took in the last book was laying down the gauntlet and walking out on her master who said he couldn't love her. All of that doubt and pain is eradicated with an email and a look from the wealthiest, most handsome man on the planet within the first five pages of the second book.<br /><br />Same structural problems in the second novel as the first. Lots of pointless detail. Way too many emails used as a substitution for writing. I think they either had someone else ghost write itthe second book or there was some thought put into editing this second book after all the complaints about the first book as I found it slightly easier to read, though still incredibly boring and silly. EL James really took the \\"never underestimate the taste of the american people\\" meme to the bank. The only thing worse than the second book is the first, which will always stand out in my mind as the biggest piece of garbage my mind was ever contaminated with.<br /><br />Would love suggestions for good erotica.the second book or there was some thought put into editing this second book after all the complaints about the first book as I found it slightly easier to read, though still incredibly boring and silly.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I stumbled across Colleen Hoover's other two books and yesterday as I was searching again I found this one! It was good and intriguing and I couldn't wait to see how it ended! As a mother I like a book that I can get into that world for just a short time and this book did that!!
B001Q7JD5O|5.0|I really wasn't expecting this movie to work after the many recent failed remakes. But, Peter Jackson pulled it off. The special effects are unmatched. I don't think I have ever seen a gorilla more life like in any move other than those that were actually real gorillas. The dinosaurs also look fabulous; [SPOILER ALERT when King King cracks one of their jaw's... wow]. Besides the visuals, the movie also has heart. Jack Black is not his usual self. He really does a terrific job of playing a driven movie producer. Naomi Watts is a wonderfully modern damsel in distress. The story is well adapted, and it works. There are so many fabulous contrasts (1930s depression juxtaposed to New York entertainment's high society, the horribly terrifying King juxtaposed to the captivating femininity of Naomi Watts, etc). Peter Jackson's King Kong is a quintessential cinematic masterpiece.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This was our book club selection for this month. I had a hard time getting into it, but then couldn't put it down! There was love and mystery and deceit all rolled together.  I would definitely recommend.
B00787IR2Q|5.0|This movie should rank among the top ten family films of all time. The story is original and fun. Rick Moranis is perfect as usual, and the other characters are also well done.  The entire film is fantastic. Even though many of the special effects don't live-up to today's standards, they still work. You really get caught up in the idea that these kids are mere millimeters in height. How can you not love this movie?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing, never expected the ending, couldn't put it down! ADDICTIVE !!!!!!!!!!!<br />Loved it!!!!! Thriller, emotional, no words could tell how good it was!!!!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Great movie. A Total Classic. Loved the bonus features!! :) Of course a must have for any Disney movie fan!
B007P3TMW2|3.0|The story was long and mostly boring. I like Sandra so that was the only reason I watched it at all.
0761169253|5.0|The contents were applicable to my profession and interests.<br />I have recommeded it to my close  friends  and professional colleagues.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Think most people would like this movie. Good action and easy to follow story line. I would watch it the second time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I loved this show. Great sets, costumes, and acting. I can see why it won so many awards, good show.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Did not have a good story line and was hard to stay interested in the movie. Would not recommend this to my friends.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|the story was creepy like the typical tim burton style but not too scary for my 2 yr old to love.  the animation was amazing as well. great family movie!
1619690039|5.0|David Baldacci always delivers an intriguing story and such is the case with Zero Day. I'm never disappointed with his work. Zero Day has plenty of suspense and action. Baldacci is a master at bringing his characters to life.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I could only give this a 5 star rating: It's my favorite show! But the other reason I chose a 5 is this: I spend a fair amount of my time visiting my daughter & her family to help out with the kids. Playing with my grandchildren is the best thing in life, but Tuesday nite means NCIS, and they have no network TV at their house. With my purchase of Season10, I'm able  watch my favorite show after the little ones go to sleep, or at any time that is convenient for me.<br />I would highly recommend to any diehard fan such as I.
B001NYTUXU|4.0|Thia has always been one of my favorite animated films.  It is hard to separate the show from the music.
1451638450|5.0|This latest novel in the \\"Miles Vorkosigan\\" universe provides at long last a story centred on Miles' cousin, and often his reluctant sidekick, Ivan Vorpatril.<br /><br />Although at the time of writing (Feb 2013) this is the sixteenth and most recently published book in the series it is chronologically the fifteenth and penultimate story: it is set around a year after the conclusion of \\"[[ASIN:0743436121 Diplomatic Immunity]]\\" and about four years prior to \\"[[ASIN:1451637500 Cryoburn  SC (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)]].\\"<br /><br />Captain Lord Ivan Xav Vorpatril came over, most unfairly, as a bit dumb during most of the previous books of the series because they were told from the perspective of his brilliant cousin Miles. Throughout his life he has never had the opportunity to forget how dangerous politics can be: his father was gunned down on the day he was born, (for the story of the \\"Vordarian Pretendership,\\" an attempted coup in which Ivan's father was killed, see \\"[[ASIN:0330317202 Barrayar]])\\" with the result that Ivan's birthday has always included a commemoration of his murdered dad. For the third of a century following his birth, until his cousin Emperor Gregor married in \\"[[ASIN:0671578278 A Civil Campaign  (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)]]\\" and started producing children, Ivan was never more than three heartbeats away from the throne of Barrayar, and therefore had to be constantly watched by Imperial Security. In self defence he has developed a persona designed to stop him looking like a threat, keeping his nose as clean as possible while avoiding any distinction which might get him promoted above the rank of Captain, building an (inaccurate) reputation for having no great intelligence and a (largely accurate) one as a ladies' man.<br /><br />At the start of this book Ivan is just coming up to his thirty-fifth birthday and has accompanied his present boss, the Admiral who is Chief of Operations for the Barrayaran Navy, to the Komarr system. There is a knock on the door of the apartment where Ivan is staying: Byerly, (By), a distant relative who works for Imperial Security, has a favour to ask. The criminals By is trying to catch are taking an interest in a beautiful woman who may know something about them or may need protecting from them. Can Ivan try to make friends with her, protect her and find out what if anything she knows?<br /><br />Unfortunately By has not told Ivan the full story: this assignment is both a lot more complex and a lot more dangerous than Ivan realises - getting through this one may require the sort of quick reactions and outragous tactics more often associated with Cousin Miles ...<br /><br />Up there with \\"A civil campaign\\" as one of the most hysterically funny books in a very amusing series: this book had me laughing out loud more than once.<br /><br />At its best, as it is in this volume, the Vorkosigan SF saga is one of the most amusing comedy science fiction series ever written.<br />It currently consists of ten full length Miles Vorkosigan novels, five other novels including this one set in the same fictional Universe, several novellas and short stories, and \\"[[ASIN:1416556036 The Vorkosigan Companion]]\\".<br /><br />All these novels and stories can stand on their own. But several of them, of which this is one, will give you something extra if you have read the books set earlier in the same timeline.<br /><br />In particular, you will get more out of this book if you have previously read \\"Barrayar,\\" \\"[[ASIN:0671877445 Cetaganda (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)]]\\" and \\"A Civil Campaign.\\"<br /><br />The full sequence of books in this Universe is as follows. The tale of the bioengineered quaddies and how Leo Graf helped them free themselves from slavery, which happened about 235 years before this book, is given in<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:0671653989 Falling Free]]\\"<br /><br />The story of the romance between Miles' parents is given in the two books:<br /><br />\\"Shards of Honour\\"<br />\\"Barrayar\\"<br /><br />and these two books have also been published together in one volume as \\"[[ASIN:0671877496 Cordelia's Honor]].\\"<br /><br />The Miles Vorkosigan adventures are:<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:0743468406 The Warrior's Apprentice (Vorkosigan)]]\\"<br />\\"The Vor Game\\"<br />\\"[[ASIN:0671720937 Borders of Infinity]]\\" which is a set of 3 linked novellas<br />\\"Cetaganda\\"<br />\\"Brothers in Arms\\"<br />\\"Mirror Dance\\"<br />\\"Memory\\"<br />\\"Komarr\\"<br />\\"A Civil Campaign\\"<br />\\"Diplomatic Immunity\\"<br />\\"Cryoburn\\"<br /><br />And finally this book, \\"Captain Vorpatril's Alliance\\" set between \\"Diplomatic Immunity\\" and \\"Cryoburn\\" is one of two novels in which the central character is one of Miles' friends. The other is a solo adventure for Miles' friend Elli Quinn, in which she meets a doctor from a planet whose population consists entirely of gay men. That story is called<br /><br />\\"Ethan of Athos\\"<br /><br />All the books in the Vorkosigan Universe prior to this one and \\"Cryoburn\\" have been republished in six compilation volumes, each of which contains two or three of the individual novels or novellas.<br /><br />I have already mentioned \\"Cordelia's Honour\\" and the other compilation volumes are<br /><br />\\"Young Miles\\"<br />\\"Miles Errant\\"<br />\\"Miles, Mystery and Mayhem\\"<br />\\"Miles in Love\\" and<br />\\"Miles, Mutants and Microbes.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed all these books and strongly recommend them, just be careful if you are trying to complete the set that you don't accidentally duplicate the books you own by purchasing a compilation volume consisting of books you already have!
B00AU15HPC|4.0|This is an easy listening CD. It is clearly in the classic Justin Hayward at the beginning of the play list. He deviates into a more country genre in the middle and at the end he does a techo adaptation of (you're) Out There Somewhere. (not a big fan of techno) Overall I am pleased with the work. Hayward shows his versatility as a composer/ musician/arranger. As if he needed to prove that to anyone. I consider this to be worth the investment.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Only had for a few days...and only leaving review for the 5 dollar things...lol. Decent game. Kills time.<br />Yadda yadda yadda..
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Interesting factual stuff.  Given the committee that apparently wrote this it ain't a literary marvel but it does put a unique face on a aspect of our military that is not very well known or understood. Worth reading.
B0068THAGY|5.0|The movie was excellent and they did a good job. It's a typical movie in its genre but I enjoyed it. Thanks to Amazon Prime that its free to watch!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Pure Stephen King. Went on vacation with it and didn't want to leave poolside, or turn the lights off at night in bed, until I finished just one more chapter.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I hated for it to be finished. This is Stephen King still at his best. This is a must read for fans. I couldn't wait to get back to it when I wasn't reading.
B000BU0C98|5.0|Great doing business. Would definitely do it again. Got the item in an efficient manner and is in great quality.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent character development over time.  Very good plots and subplots. The sets and scenery are fantastic. Attention to detail really helps create the atmosphere of that era.
B0074MZSPO|5.0|Great doing business. Would definitely do it again. Got the item in an efficient manner and is in great quality
B004XUMMFE|3.0|I've lost my taste for really grotesque and graphic shows. I know bad things happen, but I don't want to have to view them up close.
B000H7JD90|5.0|Great doing business. Would definitely do it again. Got the item in an efficient manner and is in great quality
034580404X|5.0|I chose to rate this at all five stars because I borrowed the whole series originally from my friend and finally decided that I needed to own it myself. Buying the trilogy package was my best bet because it saved on shipping costs for each individual book and I was sure that all books were new.<br /><br />The seller sent the books in a box with Styrofoam peanuts and it arrived in a timely manner.<br /><br />Very happy with my purchase and would recommend both the series and the seller to others!
B005C9YZIW|5.0|The HD quality of content is very good. Additional features are worth the extra.<br />The BBC narative is better than US version.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great stories, wonderful acting. Big surprises. Leaves you wanting more. Can't wait for season 2 to arrive on Amazon Prime, very excited.
B001NBEWN6|5.0|I'll admit at the very beginning, I worried that the overdescriptive prose was a bit too much.  But after settling into the rhythm of the novel, its purpose becomes more clear.  Excellent story, beautifully paced.
B000GUJYRE|5.0|This is imho one of the best cycles you can get nowadays, together with Abbado's Berlin cycle.<br />Haitink is very honest to Beethovens metronome marks. I saw him doing the Cycle with COE in Amsterdam and prefer this one over the &#34;sensational&#34; Thielemann-cycle, allthough the Vienna Phil is ofcourse unsurpassed in this repertoire.<br />Haitinks temporelations are always very natural, no show-off, just music and his orchetral sound very well balanced. I love this SACD-set.
B001KP2J3U|5.0|All star cast including Bette Davis,Maggie Smith,and Angela Lansbury. A must to see if you like Agatha Christie films.  Very fun to see the pro actresses at work. You will not be bored. I laugh every time I hear Maggie Smith bite Bette Davis head off when they argue. It was a pleasure to see this in the theatre.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|Well, what can one say that isn't been said about this recording?<br />Best recording of all time, best sold album ever!!!!<br />I had the release of 1997 and just wanted to have this collectors item release, also because of the complete Ring on 1 Bluray-audio-disc. I can now listen to Götterdämmerungs 1st act and Walküre 2nd act without getting out of my chair for almost 2 hours!<br />I just love this Ring best! (I also have Haitink, Karajan, Janowski, Boulez, Böhm, Levine and Barenboim.)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this easy read. I'm excited to see the movie because I believe that it could easily be translated to the big screen.
B009B0L324|5.0|I just LOVE this cd!<br />All the songs in a concert that I saw on tv a few weeks before I got them! It's on my car or on the cd player all the time!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This story is amazing in so many ways. Jaycee should be proud of her courage and strength, between the captivity and freedom she is strong and will always be admired for that.
B008I43DYU|4.0|Easily accessible and easy to use. Great for banking or calculating spending/payments! I recommend this app, especially if you have difficulty with your phone!
B001JIFYSA|5.0|My kind of movie.  I liked the numerous story lines.<br />I am a romantic movie love and this had so many angles..
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I was happy the way the processing was handled, great job. Keep up the good work. I'm sure others will be satisfied with your service
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never fails to deliver an excellent book.  I think this one is my favorite so far.  I could read this one over and over.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|It was great at the beginning and then it went through an upgrade of some sort and now I get a constant error message each time I try to run it, &#34;Missing data file. Try again later.&#34;  I uninstalled, reinstalled it, cleared the cache, and nothing worked.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I always feel like the first season of a sitcom is somewhat rocky as characters begin as stereotypical templates and grow into their own unique person. With The Big Bang Theory, everyone really hits their stride from episode 1, and that makes this show feel authentic. The laughs are plentiful and it's just a joy to watch.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This game is easy and fun. Sometimes you have to tap a few times to get the game to respond. But all in all not a bad game. Great for someone who has never played a classic point and click game before.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was very funny, you can get lost in this one, when I was reading the time just seem to get away because I could not put it down.
