0345803485|2.0|Can't figure out why all the big excitement about this book. I've read some wonderful and exciting sex novels in my day, but this is a big disappointment. I have no idea what the characters look like and the story is far fetched. It's like some kind of bad dream.
B0025KVLTM|3.0|Okay.  The Beatles and their albums have been talked to death.  Their and Brian Wilson's mature work continue to be among my most beloved music.  A year or two goes by when I might not listen to them as much, but less so in recent years.  Not that they're alone, and not that I haven't got a thousand favorite musical tracks from hundreds of artists, but they certainly always hold a special place in my heart.<br />The Beatles from Rubber Soul to Abbey Road and the Beach Boys from Pet Sounds and Smile through Holland are I think their most durable and remarkable works.  I've listened to them from their original vinyl pressings (except Smile which I heard on bootlegs) to repressings to Mobile Fidelity virgin vinyl half-speed remasters to CD's to the CD remasters.  I think that considering that the sonic work done with each new release of Beach Boys material has been revelatory, coming to an astounding peak when Pet Sounds was accorded a DVD AUDIO release.  It fills the room with clarity and presence.  (Don't miss Elton's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road in DVD-A, it's even more of a sonic wonder, coming from a newer source)<br />Now for The Beatles.  Constantly trotting out the unvarnished original mixes is pretty much a waste of time.  Even when George Martin went back to the tapes for the boy's ROCK N ROLL album, he centered the vocal mixes rather than stay with some old phony ping-pong stereo and opened up the mixes.  When others tried their hands (The Yellow Submarine Songbook - rather than the original soundtrack, and The Beatles #1 - the original CD), they cleaned up, sharpened, and sometimes repaired mistakes (like Eleanor Rigby on Submarine), opening up the tracks beautifully.  Listen to Yellow Submarine - the movie - on DVD or Blu-Ray.  The songs are breathtakingly new.  What do we NOT have on the \\"remastered\\" CDs?  That.<br />Will SOMEONE with some imagination go back to those tapes and hear them with new ears?  We'll always have the original mixes. Especially from Help! onwards, and those primitive first two, we need to open up those mixes to sound fresh and alive.  Now even #1 sounds like an old release.  The original vinyls sound better.  Let's give the Beatles the sonic enema they gave Pet Sounds and release them on DVD-A or SACD (which I don't have so I don't push it).  Many of us have DVD players, and some of us have them hooked up to home theatre sound devices.  The format should be accessible, I agree.  But at the VERY least give them the goose that Beach Boy lovers have been able to track through the songs' many incarnations, each better than the last on basic CDs, not muddy the sound as was done with #1 (the remaster).  Somebody send this out to Paul, who may show some interest in this approach.<br />I'm not complaining about George Martin's extraordinary work with the Beatles, but even he saw the possibilities of freshening the sound with Rock N Roll and others, not forgetting the shattering mixes on Cirque du Soleil's LOVE.  We're not talking radical song mixes and medleys and sound effects that weren't there.  Just, as I said, the clarity and presence of sound.  Making the buried vocal of the stereo \\"Rain\\" a little clearer and maybe a trifle more up front, for example, or centering the band's vocals on the early material.  Martin has done that himself.  It's not blasphemy, it's understanding the possibilities of stereo sound in a way that was fairly foreign when they recorded.  The Beatles weren't even there for the stereo mix of Pepper, and you can hear many differences in mixing and even in takes and speed (She's Leaving Home, the galvanizing mono version of the Pepper Reprise) that Martin and his assistants mixed into stereo in a short time.  (See THE BEATLES RECORDING SESSIONS by Mark Lewissohn) Go back to those tracks and fix them (he reintegrated the louder laughs that were supposed to be apparent at the end of Within You Without You, why not treat their other sonic decisions with as much respect?)<br />WhenThe Hollies hits were collected in a 3-CD set, almost all of the songs were remixed from ping-pong stereo to soundstage stereo. It was wonderful.  And when a song or two wasn't allowed a remix, you could hear it's age.  Ever since Submarine and #1, I hoped for something similar for the Beatles.<br />Even the mono mixes, though accurate in balance, have a muddy sound.  Listen to The Beach Boys mono mixes on their various CDs.  They're as clear and distinct as their stereo releases. (Mono was how Brian heard them) And their stereo reimaginings on later releases have been sterling.  Pet Sounds was missing several independent tracks, so you need the original mono to really hear how some tracks were envisioned.<br />I bought a few of The Beatles albums in mono first, and found them wonderful and clear.  Now all the high ends are dull.<br />All the Beatles CDs should shine.  Hey, just an opinion.  Now the recordings and releases have been talked to death.  Best wishes all, and cry out for real, imaginative craftsmanship.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" is well written and does hold the reader's interest.  But it is page after page of extremely graphic sexual encounters.  And I do not like the way the female character was treated by the male character.  I will not buy the next books in the line up.  This book ended with the female character leaving the male in a fury.  If she has any brains, she will stay away but that would certainly stop any sequels.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Forget reading the book and just read the negative reviews ABOUT the book!  They're far more entertaining!<br />Awesome job guys!  You guys are hilarious!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm not sure where the author did her \\"research\\" or if she did any at all, but she got it all wrong. These books are horrid and make the BDSM lifestyle look like a horror story. The books themselves are poorly written. They are nothing but soft core porn.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is awesome because you have goals and a collection and every once in a while Scrat running across the screen.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Every track is a masterpiece, not a sleeper on the whole album.  I haven't felt this level of awe since 1993, a spectacular story told in this concept album. No doubt, this will be a hard one to top, but we know, Rush can do it!

B007R3AZNK|5.0|You would think with all the CDs that Joe has released I would no longer be amazed by his incredible guitar playing, but I am!<br />His style of playing does something for me that very few other guitarists can. It is such a joy to listen to him play! And, since he plays so many different guitars you don't get the same guitar sound song after song.<br />On \\"Lonely Town Lonely Street\\" he even treats us to a solo in which he and organist Arlen Schierbaum exchange licks like Ritchie Blackmore and Jon Lord used to do in Deep Purple.<br />Any lover of great guitar playing can't go wrong with Joe.<br />We are privileged to have him!
B004A8ZX28|4.0|This film is a real sleeper, it's not \\"Avatar\\" so I can't give it five stars but it is a solid four star movie. I just couldn't figure out where the story was going [I suppose that's the idea]. I have to admit it didn't take long to get pulled in and I couldn't wait to see where it ended up. Without giving anything away I will say I wasn't disappointed at the end. I enjoyed this movie and I'm very happy that it's now part of my collection.

The visuals are eye-popping and unlike any recent sci fi film. Bottom line, Ridley Scott just knows how to make science fiction movies. You will not be disappointed. A new masterpiece!
0385736002|4.0|Two ordinary teens suddenly find themselves having to believe in the stories of myth and legend and magic. Twins Josh and Sophie Newman didn't think that their world would change drastically when they met Nick Flemming until his true identity is revealed as Nicholas Flamel. Magic exists. And that's just the beginning. Will the twins survive the fight and who can they trust?<br /><br />I've read this book before. It's a fun read. Action packed and it leaves you longing for more. I was introduced to the Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel series in the aftermath of Harry Potter. I've been eagerly awaiting the 6th and final book in this series, but then realized that I needed to do a massive re-read before reading the 6th book.<br /><br />I recommend this book and this series to Harry Potter fans, young adults, and anyone who loves to see myth and legend come to life.<br /><br />Rating - 4 stars

B007J4T2G8|5.0|All three books are a must read. The book is fun and entertaining. Once I started, I couldn't put it down.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|What more do they have to do?  As if all of the hits and albums aren't enough, now they add to that yet another strong release that projects the energy and creativity of a much younger band.  To say they've been overlooked is a gross understatement.<br /><br />Rush finds the zone on Clockwork Angels, concentrating most on heavy, groove-laden hard rock riffs underscored by a thumping bass line.  Of course, it wouldn't quite be Rush if you didn't also get ambitious, adventurous compositions and passages in the mix.<br /><br />These tracks offer those elements in abundance, but never stray too far from the basic strengths that have made Rush one of rock's most enduring acts.  While several songs, like the title track and The Garden, are quite dynamic and display the wide range of abilities typical of a band with the skill set of Rush, the foundation still rocks solidly throughout.<br /><br />The title track is a great example of this.  Mellow balladry early on quickly gives way to heavy, bass-happy prog-rock, then a catchy, melodic chorus.  They start over and run through the cycle a bit faster, then move into some nice soloing by Alex over Geddy's pounding bass.  Next is a journey through some almost trippy verses before the song finishes with the chorus and one last blast of heavy guitar.<br /><br />You'll also find most of these qualities in varying arrangements on the album's other notably strong tracks, Caravan, BU2B, Carnies, Seven Cities of Gold, and Headlong Flight.  My personal favorite is Seven Cities of Gold, an epic track featuring one of the album's best riffs, brilliant jazzy bass work and guitar solos, and a fantastic chorus. This one's an instant classic for me.<br /><br />And Geddy Lee's vocals sound incredible.  His clean, clear, nuanced, melodic singing complements the music as it always has, but I personally think his voice has become more resonant as he's gotten older.<br /><br />Rush hasn't lost a step  in my opinion, and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame loses more credibility every year that it keeps out bands like them.  Whether they get voted in or not doesn't really matter, because people who know anything about music know that Rush is a legitimate legendary rock act, and this new album just adds more polish to their stellar career.ame loses more credibility every year that it keeps out bands like them.

0375507256|3.0|Cloud Atlas is a masterful writing exercise, a brilliant display of writing craft, technique, legerdemain, etc., etc.  But is it a great novel?  In my view, no.  Why?  Because it lacks the staying power of great novels.  I just finished reading Cloud Atlas, and I can already feel it slipping from my memory.  There are interesting ideas aplenty in this novel, and many a finely wrought passage.  (Mitchell is obviously a very talented, creative, and ambitious writer.)  Yet, there was not one character in Cloud Atlas, across its many century span, who I cared about in the least.  Nor did any of its interconnected stories move me in any way.  In the end, what impressed me most (and greatly so) about Cloud Atlas were Mitchell's talents as wordsmith, his ear for dialect, and his prodigious creativity.  For all that, however, as a novel Cloud Atlas left me cold.  Mitchell may be a great writer (I think he is), but Cloud Atlas is not a \\"great\\" novel.  Even so, it's well worth reading.  And I, for one, look forward to seeing what else Mitchell has up his sleeve.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Man, nothing scares me any more, you know what I'm sayin?  I first heard of this chick a few months ago via that song 'Video Games' on the radio. I thought she was pretty creepy and steered left. Then, I was trying to find some new stuff for a friend of mine who is also pretty creepy and I was instantly like ah-ha and peeped out this album, and suddenly I feel like I have been lured into some kind of a witchs grip, because I can't get it out of my mind...<br /><br />Really there is some real talent in this bit. Some times she goes low, with this Jessica Rabbit style darkness, other times she goes all radio pop teen high and sexy, but then you realize it's still dark as death. The whole thing has the scent of death covered in cinnamon. It's really kind of freaking me out, but i can't turn away...<br /><br />All original stuff, written by the talent herself, a good mix of old fashioned sultry blues and modern electro pop...sometimes w/psychedelic skews to throw everyone off... i like it. Check out some of the tracks BLUE JEAN, SUMMERTIME SADNESS and maybe that one DIET MOUNTAIN DEW... I think you might dig it.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|This cd is so good.  It makes my soul smile.  I love Rihanna.  She's so talented. The video for track 2 is so beautiful.  She is perfect.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have read several reviews of readers complaining about books 4 and 5 of this series. I just finished book 3 and I still find the plot engrossing and the characters rich and consistent.<br />It's quite true that the author is overly descriptive quite often. We don't really need to know in detail what is being served for each meal, nor must we read about every single ornament found in the characters' clothes. Sometimes we are also thrown off rhythm by extremely lengthy - and unnecessary really - descriptions of dreams and thoughts. The book could be shortened by a quarter without losing any of its appeal and magic.<br />I'm also following HBO's adaptation and while the screenplay made a good job at simplifying the plot and roster of characters, I find the books much more compelling. A lot of the analyses concerning strategic options are lost on TV. That's a very critical part of the narrative. Besides, HBO has clearly censored some of the more unconventional parts. All characters on TV have the legal age for sex and alcohol. Besides, kids are less brutal and none of them are responsible for killings, which is not really credible or compatible with the brutality of the societies where the story develops.<br />I'm approaching books 4 and 5 with ominous feelings that I'll also be disappointed with the coming installments. Well, there's always HBO...
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book, and could not put it down.  The relationships and emotions felt real. The characters felt real. I particularly liked how they lampooned the rituals of the cancer support group, but then resorted to utilizing them as mantras when the going got tough. One of my favorite reads ever.

0393088774|5.0|Dr. Krugman's book summarizes in one place his ongoing efforts to elucidate the ongoing economic disaster.  He begins by setting the stage as to the importance of unemployment upon individuals and the toll this takes on production that will never be replaced.  He carefully refutes the simplistic, ideologically driven arguments from the Austrian school of economics, which are currently prevailing in stopping the needed actions in both Europe and the US. His explanation of the unique aspects of the Euro zone are well done for the lay reader, not an easy task.  For those who have been expecting runaway inflation with the Fed's actions to print money to save the financial system, as well as those who cannot wrap their heads around the concept that taking on more government debt is a reasonable way to cope with the debt crisis of the private sector, this is an important book to read.<br /><br />I am now on my second read through, and expect this book to get many more as this crisis continues.  I only hope that those in power apply Dr. Krugman's solutions, as they make the most sense for a world economy brought to its knees by the deregulated, misguided, inequitable, and reckless private sector of the past decades.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts was the chapter on fear of government debt, and how the fear of deficits are actually condemning us to ever greater deficits via lower growth in the future. Dr. Krugman points out the the federal debt at the end of WWII was higher as percent of GDP than now.  How did we pay it off?  We didn't, we simply grew and inflated gradually so that a generation later it was a much smaller fraction of the GDP.  That is, until Ronald Reagan took the deficits to new heights.  Great information from a great author!

0316017922|5.0|Bought the book for my daughter for college and then my husband read it.  They both really enjoyed reading it.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This was a magnificent movie. I just can't say enough good things about it, and you can take your kids to watch it too because there was no vulgar language or X-rated material. John Carter's 19th century southern moral code was refreshing as well. Loved the way he taught the Martians how to salute each other US military style, and I loved Woola, the Martian equivalent to an Earth dog. What a fun creature! I read the series as a kid, and I have to say Disney did a great job with John Carter's character. In literature, Carter is the kind of hero that never opens the door a crack to search for danger. He's the type of brash, impetuous youth who flings doors open only to find hundreds of enemies on the other side. He's stubborn and direct in his approach to all things. He's humble too. I liked the way (in the movie) he went down on his knee to the Princess of Mars at the end and asked her hand in marriage. You'll enjoy it!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Love this application for the kindle fire.  I use it a lot at work and at home.  I love the display and simplicity.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have found that this is about the best thing I ever put on my phones and my kindle fire. The younger kids love it, and it comes in really handy to let them play this during those boring moments like waiting in a dr. office, being out for dinner or even if they are in the back seat of the car being rambunctious. All that with a FREE price tag (at least, that is the version I have).
0345803485|4.0|I really liked \\"50shadesofgrey\\" because there was alot of dialogue between the Protagonist her self and Mr.Grey. I enjoyed the detail of a screenwtriter that she personified thoroughout the book,I would of perferred that writing style for a movie as in my opinion it lacked \\"feeling\\" or place for me. The story was good, I enjoyed the scene of jelousies and protrayal of aman whom no one knows and is rich at 27, it made more sense to be at the end of his 30s,and that scene where she throws up at the club, could of played out better for somereason it wasnt believable.<br />I feel that I could'nt find Anastatsia to be anyone I knew or she did not act like anyone i knew would act she acted expected like she was set out on a mission, there were no trials to her we didn't know much about her... If you wanted a good read READ the FEVER series by karen m monining. Any way I liked it but not enough to have to get part 2. tha'ts mee... who ever liked it gr8!
0743298039|2.0|Finally finished reading this book after many previous attempts.  I'm surprised I made it through.  In my opinion, this novel's strong points were grossly overrated.  It was hailed as a scary story of sorts, the type to give you nightmares. Seriously?  It was slightly interesting, at best.  The copy I read was given to me, glad I didn't spend money on it.

1936608898|5.0|Co-workers would ask me if I had had lunch if I was critical or demanding. They noticed that I was meaner when I was hungry and, unfortunately, I was hungry a lot. Eventually I was eating 6 times per day, but still got hungry. And as I got older, I got heavier. My body fat ballooned up to 37 percent. If you had known me in 1994 when I was competing in a marathon (26.2 mile) race every month, you might not believe it possible, but I gained 55 pounds.<br /><br />I decided to do something about it in 2008 and joined a CrossFit gym - lifting weights, performing gymnastic moves, and literally standing on my head doing high intensity exercise three times per week. I ran 5 to 10 miles every weekend. I ate better - lots of salmon and veggies from the frozen food case - but after two years of effort, my body fat was still 27 percent. I had lost 20 pounds, but remained pudgy. Then I heard about Dallas and Melissa Hartwig's Whole30 program.<br /><br />I did my first Whole30 in 2010. About two weeks into the program, I noticed that I was sleeping better. Then I started to set new personal records lifting heavy weights in the gym. I felt great and my energy levels stayed even across the day. I quit being so grumpy! I decided to keep following the Whole30 way of eating. After a few months, my annual blood work showed big improvements: good cholesterol - UP, bad cholesterol - DOWN. And I was losing weight. Nothing dramatic, but typically two pounds per month. The two pounds per month continued 15 months and I lost 30 pounds! I finally stopped losing weight when I was just 10 pounds above my marathon running weight from the 90's. And that 10 pounds was all new muscle!<br /><br />I first met Dallas and Melissa Hartwig in 2011 when I attended one of their in-person nutrition workshops. They were just as smart, friendly, and good looking in person as they were online. They are truly inspiring people. And their book - It Starts With Food - is just like them - smart, practical, informative, kind, tough, motivating, inspiring, hopeful...<br /><br />As someone who has read most of the information on their website and attended their workshops, I expected to be familiar with everything in It Starts With Food, but I was wrong. The discussions of food cravings, the psychology of eating, and much of the science was new to me. And the Hartwigs made the science interesting. I wish my high school and college biology teachers had been as clear and practical as them! The Whole30 program is discussed in the book and the Hartwigs explain how you can do your own Whole30 and start getting the same kind of results I got in mine.<br /><br />It Starts With Food is an incredible resource for anyone who wants to develop a healthier relationship with food or who just plain needs to because what they are doing now is killing them.ive, kind, tough, motivating, inspiring, hopeful...<br /><br />As someone who has read most of the information on their website and attended their workshops, I expected to be familiar with everything in It Starts With Food, but I was wrong.

B007MAETA8|3.0|John Myer is a talented  musician and overall artist, however this album feels like he went about making an album that takes away from his best strengths as a artist and feels like he settled for a middle of the record that is accessible and it lacks any real what i call Money tracks. feels like a middle of the road record from a cat who outta be in his prime and peak. to me John Mayer outta be exploring a Larry Carlton meets a Pat Metheny  type of project, instead alot of this record which at best are 2nd tier tracks.<br /><br />this album is missing that something and a song that makes a statement.vocally and lyrical stand point he is cool, however the bigger picture feels half baked.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Great game. Very challenging and continues to get harder the further you go. Hours and plenty of plane rides of fun.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This app is super fun! Anyone should totally buy it. The only problem is that super addictive! Blab blab blab.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|Such a great premise! What it is like to be a Redshirt crewman and realize that you were screwed.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. I really did. The story starts strong. It reminded me of the Stainless Steel Rat in tone. Then about 1/3 of the way through the book is the Big Reveal. Then it becomes more poorly written than the lower quality ST TV episodes that it lampoons. Although it has time travel, and meta, etc.,  it falls apart. The dialog was sophomoric and, as many reviewers have said, all of the characters speak in the same voice. I also suffered through the needless codas.<br /><br />I think that this started as a great idea and short story. It reminds me of James Blish's stories in Star Trek 1 - 12. Not the movies, the books released in the 70's. They novelized the TV episodes, and then boldly went on, with new original stories.<br />One of the stories was a takeoff of Mirror Mirror, and remarkably similar to Galaxy Quest. Shatner, Nimoy, et al are filming a scene in the transporter room when there is a flash and Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Uhura are actually aboard the real Enterprise. They have to \\"act\\" out their parts. Nimoy, as in the series, can't keep it straight, and laughs and cries in the turbolift. A fanciful, yet thankfully short, story. Redshirts is like that story. But it needed to stop about halfway through.
B0054LVP3Q|4.0|Christine wakes up each day not knowing where she is and why she looks twenty years older...what has happened? She doesn't even remember her husband.  Following an accident, she is unable to remember any new memories and doesn't remember anything from the last twenty or so years.  Her husband explains the situation to her daily and then leaves for work.  She begins working with a physician who wants her to keep a daily journal so that each day she can read it and put together more and more pieces of her life.<br /><br />The premise of the book was interesting to me.  I enjoyed trying to figure out what was going on, along with the character of Christine.  I thought it was a great book and I also enjoyed the ending.  I wasn't disappointed with this one.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|amazon please please please please please please please make a Voxer for the Kindle Fire!!!!!! all my friends have it on their devices but I don't have it on mine. so please make a Voxer(:
B005PTYP70|5.0|This is one of the few movies that has sequels that are just as good as the original movie. I hope they keep coming.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I will start by being completely up front about two things:<br /><br />1) I am a HUGE Rush fan<br /><br />2) I do NOT now, nor expect to any time soon, own an mp3 player nor enjoy anything about the concept.  I am an ALBUM person.  I like to hear EVERYTHING an artist has decided to release at that moment in their career.  I do expect filler songs, I do expect highs and lows, but I call an album GREAT if it can take me somewhere, make me actually FEEL something deep down inside when I listen to it from beginning to end.  And there's just something irreplacable about holding that jewelcase or vinyl jacket in your hands....<br /><br />SO, here we are in 2012.  Go ahead, try to think of ANY band, new or old, that can release a truly great ALBUM of material that is discussed in its entirety, song by song, that actually takes you on a journey from beginning to end.  A cohesive, collective work that in it's ENTIRETY (not just radio release 1, 2, etc.) is really something to savor, enjoy, discuss, DIGEST!  In my opinion, there is only one band that does that CONSISTANTLY today - and that band is NOT Rush! (Surprised?) Nope, IMHO, that band is none other than Porcupine Tree.  But enough about them...Rush is now and will forever be my favorite 'all time' band.  But nothing since Power Windows (other than a little gold nugget called 'Counterparts') really sold me as a solid front-to-back ALBUM.  That is until 6/12/2012 and the release of Clockwork Angels.<br /><br />This work has reminded me what a GREAT RUSH ALBUM was!  Forget popping an earbud off your head and handing it to your buddy, saying \\"hey, check this SONG out\\".  This is one of those rare works that harkens back to when I grew up, and a friend of mine called me and simply said \\"don't go ANYWHERE....I'm coming over and I'm bringing something I want you to hear\\" (which, incidentally was Hemispheres on vinyl - me = fan forever!).  Don't get me wrong, I've found TONS to love from Rush's recent releases.  They've all impressed me to varying degrees and I enjoy them all very much.  But Clockwork Angels MOVED me!  I get chills, I feel those butterflies in the stomach, I have verses and choruses and solos still bouncing around in my head after I hear it.  It moves and breathes and plays with your emotions.  It's full of magic moments, it's bold, it's heartfelt.  It's everything a GREAT album should be.<br /><br />So go ahead, pick up Clockwork Angels and get lost in its depths.  Then call a buddy, go to his or her house, and share the magic.....
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I love the angry bird series. Have and played them all but I do not appreciate not getting updates when I paid for the app.  While my husband who has an android phone and the FREE app, has two more updates than me.  Hey Amazon, what's up with that?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Simple, but very effective.  Easy to use, easy to read and covers all needs of a basic calculator.  Nice free app.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I love hidden object games, and thought this would be something to toy with on the Kindle.  It may be my lack of experience with my Kindle, but there's not a lot hidden, and the puzzle aspect is mostly just confusing.  I am looking for a true hidden object game, to keep on the Kindle, for use while waiting for appointments and such.  Anybody have a recommendation?
1466401885|4.0|I could not decide if I wanted to give this book 3 stars or 4 stars... I wish there was a 3.5.  I liked this book, I really did enjoy it.  You can relate to the characters (on some levels) and I was always interested in what was going to happen next.  However, I did think it was a little drawn out, there was unprovoked violence, and \\"Pigeon's\\" back & forth feelings towards Travis drove me crazy!!!  Having said all of that, I do not regret reading this book and I would recommend this book if you are looking for an easy Summertime read.
B0037471TE|4.0|A good read if you like action spy thrillers. Well written. You almost feel that you are an observer at every piece of action. definitely a page turner!
B005USZYDU|4.0|Since first learning about John Grisham, I set out to read all books penned by him. This one, \\"Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer\\", does not disappoint. I thoroughly enjoyed Grisham's approach of having Theodore tell the story and how he gets wrapped up in the biggest case to hit town with little effort. Furthermore, Theodore assists classmates with their delicate situations while keeping his mouth shut, thereby assuring his \\"clients\\" the utmost privacy. The funniest part of the novel places Theodore in animal court with him representing the prettiest girl in the class. Theodore actually gets the girl's dog off of the charges pressed against it.<br />I look forward to reading the entire set.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed this story where it showed a man living in darkness and having a lady show him the sunshine out of his dark cave.  This show great examples of what relationships go through up and downs.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|ausom app happy that it is now able to be on kendol fire:) u should get it realy its free y not?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its okay boring at times wish the cost was less to get games other than that the games are fun and good.
B0086700CM|4.0|wheni first downloaded temple run I was really happy to have it,  but as soon as as I started to play it it was lagging and freezing up,  I fixed this by downloading it about like 5 times before it worked correctly,  great game!
0345803485|5.0|I can't put this series down. It has made me love to read again. I usually hate to read and when a friend recommended it I thought it was worth a try, I can't get enough....
B006LSZECO|5.0|At first, I did not appreciate this novel because I found it too slow for my average pace. But, I am very happy that I had the patience to read through the entire story and not throw it away. This book makes you feel that you've got it all figured out but at the end of each chapter you'll realize that the mystery is not over just yet. This book is twisted and horrifying but fun and exciting at the same time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great for the family<br /><br />  my grandkids enjoy this game very much. we decide together what family we get next. my granddaughter loves hatching the eggs. great family time!!!
1936608898|5.0|I have read ALL of the books pertaining to the Paleo way of eating and what I liked best about this book was it's simplicity in understanding EXACTLY what you needed to do.<br />This is dummy proof - so if you're ready to change your life once and for all it's time to pick up this book and make that commitment for a new you.<br />I recommend this book to people of all ages that are ready to be better at LIFE!!

B0086700CM|4.0|The most addicting game. I have played for the Kindle Fire. Although much of it is the same and it appears you can never get tgr idle?
1936608898|5.0|Clear. Concise. Smart.

B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Well I have had my Kindle Fire for about 5 months and my son finally dropped it off the kitchen table. It was wrapped up in the shell and I now have a crack from top left corner to bottom of my screen. Did not save my screen one bit.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|I can't believe developers are still using this garbage. Just get rid of it and I would like to keep this game. uninstalled.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Yes its a free game.  But the game play is designed to but frustrating unless you keep paying money into it.  Don't waste memory space on this.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run is easy to play. The comments that the game shows after you die makes me laugh. I do find that the game has some register problems.
0812550706|5.0|This book has been one of the most read and loved books in my library. I own an extra copy just to lend it out to other people. Great story, great writing, and it's easy to fall in love with the characters. Love this book!
B0071BY1T2|4.0|Satch really delivers though, for me, the whole instrumental guitar god thing has 0 appeal and I much prefer Satch's talents in Chickenfoot.
0061726834|5.0|Okay, so I am very late in catching up with this series. For months I have been hearing great things and have wanted to read it for like forever. Finally, I managed to get my hands on it and I absolutely \\"Loved\\" it! I wish I had thought of a 6 Star rating!!<br /><br />Just in case you are one of the minority in the reading community who hasn't read this book yet, this review is for you.<br /><br />The story is based in a world where scientists have found a `cure' for love and this cure is compulsory for everyone once they attain the age of eighteen. The protagonist Lena has had to live her life under the scandalous shadows of a mother who committed suicide and a sympathizer uncle. She has always looked forward to the day when she would be `cured' and would be able to live a scandal free life. But as fate would have it - she falls in love just a couple of months before her cure!!<br /><br />So, this book is another dystopian love story... If you are thinking - `yes, been there and read that' - then you are so wrong. The first thing about this novel is that this `dystopian world' actually feels very real. The limitations, the set of rules, the situations, the government surveillance system, the `Book of Shhh' all adds to the setting and are all essential to the plot. Also, the story doesn't only revolve around `young love' but also explores the love that binds family and friendship. The characters are very believable - who are scared of the government and the society and at the same time try to rebel against it in their own ways. They are brought to life not only as an individual but also through their relationships and aspirations.<br /><br />The author's style of writing is that of a veteran. Her descriptions of situations, characters and incidents are so detailed that it feels like the words jump out of the book to create a picture right in front of your eyes! She has used our daily lingo to create a masterpiece. It is so familiar yet so refreshing!<br /><br />My only complaint is the HUGE cliffhanger with which the book ended! I have no idea when I am going to be able to get my hands on `Pandemonium'!nly complaint is the HUGE cliffhanger with which the book ended! I have no idea when I am going to be able to get my hands on `Pandemonium'!
B0086700CM|5.0|not only do i play it, but my friends and family members do too. its addictive, and entertaining. Definitely a time passer when im bored
B007KAJG3K|1.0|Movie was enjoyable, but the \\"digital copy\\" is misleading.  Give me the option of an iTunes digital copy that I can use on my devices.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a great Trilogy, the first book is more racy and provocative. Loved this, i read all three books in 8 days while working 2 jobs. I know there is a lot of negative talk about this book.  Slightly more provocative then other romance novels.... All i can say is People get a life it is only just a book!!!! I truly loved all three books and hope she writes more.....  :)
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is a fast pass stand in line play during commercial  breaks game. does need a little more extras for the perk points. all in all great for all.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this keyboard!! The only change I would like to see would be more theme options. I would love one that is customizable. Then this app would be perfect!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|...since Presto. Great guitar riffs, powerful bass and drums. No really weak song on \\"Clockwork Angels. My favorite songs the title song, Carnies, Headlong Flight and The Gardens.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like it, but its hard to see how much upgrades cost. also hard to select trucks and see how many you have, and sometimes selecting things makes them upgrade when all you want is info.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is beyond addicting. Nevermind the fact that you might be asked to buy something.. I don't mind it, but I won't be spending money on it. I'm constantly trying to improve my restaurant. :) 5 stars easily earned!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was very interesting book. I recommend you purchase all 3 parts at once because you just can`t stop reading till the end. For me it was a two week reading marathon, and I couldn't separate myself from the book or stop thinking about the story. I think it is very good for teenagers and it has a big lesson behind it.
1936608898|5.0|This book is amazing! It Starts With Food takes a great approach to explaining nutritional needs and how daily nutrition effects daily life. They use easy to understand, highly entertaining language to portray their message. This book clearly spells out both the physical and psychological effects of a healthy vs not-so-healthy diet. They also do a great job of providing very practical day-to-day tips, recipes and guidelines to make healthy eating an easy habit to pick up! When you put this book down you will not only feel like you have the knowledge about \\"why\\" but you will feel empowered to actually make the changes!!
B007JWKLMO|5.0|For those how thought they knew Harrison, you must see this. I didn't know he was that much in this \\"meditation\\" world. It translated in his music and probably his approach of man.
B00881VLCE|5.0|a lot of fun to do and a lot of fun pictures.  plus you can pick how many pieces you want to do.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I love this game but... it isn't working right. It keeps crashing and stops loading. You should wait to buy it until it works.
B001G7SS96|5.0|I am glad i got this collection,just the box itself look's wonderful.With it's holographic/glossy look,this box set is jam packed with stuff.Well first you get a giant booklet,of picture's from the movie,then you get a film strip,that when you movie it,it show's will smith running,then you get a picture set that are holographic as well,and last but not least,you get the dvd/blu-ray case.And it's a pretty nice looking case as well,it's also holographic,and glossy,this set has three disc.#1.Blu-ray movie.#2.Dvd movie.#3.Blu-ray extra feature's,all in all i am very happy i got this,and i highly recommend this.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|Don't waste your money on this one and don't fall for any of the five star reviews you see above.  I read the first two chapters of Redshirts on Tor dot com and thought I would love it.  I didn't.  It is seriously bad, cliched, self-aware Star Trek fan fiction that tries to be \\"meta\\" and fails in every way possible.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about it is that it is criminally short and I only wasted a few hours on it instead of several days.
B007V4LKRU|5.0|This Has Got To Be Rush's Best Work (Falling 2nd Would Be Either Snakes And Arrows or Test For Echo) The Pure Heaviness And Intensity Of Caravan And BU2B Is A Great Open To The Album And A Great Announcement That The Boys Are Back! But At The End Of The Day, I Have To Give It Up For 3 Songs, The Wreckers, The Garden, and Halo Effect. These Songs Will Bring Any Rush Fan To Their Knees. I Almost Cried Listening To The Garden and Halo Effect, And The Wreckers Is (Probably) The Best Song On This Record.. Maybe Even Their Best Ever!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM FOR ANY RUSH FAN!!<br /><br />LONG LIVE RUSH!
B0054JZC6E|2.0|it was.a great and very succseul. I really enjoy it and would recomand it to anyone.I'm. just super mad that j have to all this
B004ZJZPXY|5.0|Absolutely hilarious. This movie get's funnier every time I watch it. There are so many subtle jokes that are pure gold.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|It was good. Kinds dark and ended with a lot of unanswered questions. I guess I didnt like the ending.
0465011047|5.0|When one thinks about North Korea, prison camps are always in the forefront of one thoughts.But now The Aquariums of Pyongyang will help us understand what really is happening there.<br /><br />So much has been told and revealed about these camps, but not until one reads this book that one realize how brutal this system really is, and how many people suffer from this truly aweful system.<br /><br />The author mixes personal life with politics to demonstrate how much suffering he had to go through because of his family connection. Having done nothing wrong but being connected to a Grandfather who had returned from Japan to North Korea and then imprisoned and send to hard labor camp, he is himself sent to a camp to live, work and survive under the worse possible life conditions<br /><br />Not only this, but the rest of the world seems to be completely in the dark about it all. Sure we know about the camps, but do we really know how many people are suffering and forgotten. Where are the human rights group on this?<br /><br />Thanks to this very well detailed book, the reader can now comprehend the horror of what is really happening in North Korea.<br /><br />Very well written, so well written in fact that it is a hard to believe it, but yes it is all true
B000Y0S7N8|5.0|Well the big 'A' is finally dead. Or is he? Gotta love the long gurgling death throws<br />that resulted in a final declaration that he could be brought back again and again...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game to play. I like to play the game when I get bored. so if I like lots of games play this.
0670023329|4.0|It is almost impossible to believe that these things exist in this world in the 21st century, but the testimony of so many former North Koreans force one to accept that they are true.  The brutality and dehumanizing described in this story reminds one of the appalling conditions prisoners had to endure in Nazi concentration camps, but North Korea has managed to take those techniques and distill them into something so abhorrent it reads like a science fiction novel.  It's almost a relief that the government refuses to remove the children raised in their camps for they could make excellent soldiers: Raised without compassion or pity to become sociopaths who will betray each other for food or simply to avoid punishment.  Shin knows he's not recovered - he is still emotionally crippled - but that he has begun to reclaim his humanity and his conscience is remarkable and I can only hope that his recovery continues.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|i love this game. the new items are really cool especially when u get to crush stuff.this game is really addicting!
B000Y0OCSM|5.0|Yea, I gotta say that THIS was the greatest episode that I have witnessed so far.<br />Great tek-babble and plot. But, if that glass could cut thru climbing rated<br />rope, it probably would have went thru much, much more. Just Saying.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I couldn't read this book I had to give up!! Too dark and depressing. Gave me no pleasure, if I had it in paperback, I would have thrown it in the bin.
0739384171|5.0|This is so great to listen to weather at home or driving in your car.  Be sure to listen to this one before you listen to the Girl who Kicked the Hornets nest as this one is the second in the trilogy.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Had a great time playing it!!!!!! One of the most addicting games ever. I can't stop playimg it.Plus it is free!
0345803485|3.0|I have all three books. While I am not fond of erotica, I had to complete the series because of the characters. Wish auther had focused on them. Much needed is editing for crappy erotica part, repetitive blushing, flushing and inner Goddess. It is boring and kills the story intermittently. This is probably one long book and not three books. I hope they correct that in movie version.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'll admit that I'm one of those readers who likes to experience what other people are raving about. The last time I regretted that decision was when I read the awful Twilight series. 50 Shades of Grey was another extremely disappointing piece of fiction. There simply aren't words to tell you how horrible this book is. The subject matter is intriguing, but the characters are so poorly developed and unbelievable that by the end of the first chapter I couldn't care less how much sex they had or where they had it.  The only thing we really know about the handsome Christian is that his pants hang off his hips and that he has a long index finger. Oh, and that he is also a stalker who plays the piano really well, flies a plane, and is filthy rich for some reason none of us can figure out, because the man never seems to work. As for his protege, she is a simpering, silly girl who is am embarassment to real fictional heroines everywhere. (And I seriously wanted to punch her ridiculous 'inner goddess' right in the face!) Unless you're very young and/or inexperienced, you will likely find this book as boring and bland as I did. If you want erotic literature, there are much better options out there, ones that don't read like a bad Harlequin Romance. I've been told the second and third books are better, but I would rather be tied up and beaten in the Red Room of Pain than have to suffer through two more of this author's books.
0739384198|5.0|A great addition to the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  This is the last of the book and is great for listening to when you are driving.
0525423281|5.0|After reading Anna and the French Kiss, I couldn't believe that Stephanie Perkins could write a companion novel with a relationship as cute and sweet yet sexy as the one between Anna and &Eacute;tienne. (Okay, I believed in her magical writing abilities. I just couldn't imagine a couple as cute and sweet and sexy as the aforementioned.) Then I met Lola with her crazy fashion sense and Cricket with his mad inventing skills.<br /><br />Strangely, while the cover of Lola and the Boy Next Door is more whimsical than that of Anna and the French Kiss, this book also has a darker side to it. Rather than the guy being the two-timer, Lola is the one who is indecisive, and with her already having a rock-star boyfriend who is five years older... yeah. We know there are things going on, though we don't see it happening.<br /><br />That was the main thing I didn't like about this book. I couldn't understand Lola's obsession with Max, her rock-star boyfriend, and her willingness to put up with him. I wanted her to hurry up and realize that Cricket's the one--even though he broke her heart before--that there is such ting as second chances. Cricket is cute, sweet, and sexy in a different way from &Eacute;tienne. He is the boy next door, the one you love all your life.<br /><br />I could almost swear that I actually laughed out loud while reading this book. The rest of the time, I had a stupid grin on my face--and was probably giggling every now and then. Stephanie Perkins has a knack for writing books with cute romances and characters that will simultaneously charm and amuse (with personality and wit) everyone who will reads about them.<br /><br />All you girls beware: you'll be wanting an &Eacute;tienne or a Cricket for yourselves after reading this book.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game I guess it can be funny but not that much there could be bad drawing that makes it funny
1936608898|5.0|Great read with practical, entertaining, and valauble information on why we are what we choose to eat. This book by Dallas and Melissa lays out in easy to understand language why so many of the answers we seek to better health start with our nutrition. My wife and I have followed a Paleo nutrition approach since 2009 and changed our lives and the lives of many others in our CrossFit affiliate through a Paleo diet combined with exercise. This works, period. We have both completed a Whole30, hosted Dallas and Melissa's workshop, and both read their blog regularly. That said we still learned a ton through this book. If you want to get your relationship with food on track and become healthier, change your body composition, improve your fitness, and impact your life then read this and then start with a Whole30!

B005GNLZYG|4.0|The Last Unicorn is a classic tale that pits nature against man and good against evil. I first watched the film adaptation of The Last Unicorn this past year and fell in love with the story. The story follows the last unicorn left as she leaves her forest home in search of the rest of the unicorns. As she journeys across the land, she finds out that not only are the unicorns gone, man has stopped believing in unicorns. Along the way, she meets a wizard who has trouble getting spells to do what he asks of them, a woman who still believes in magic, and a prince who tugs at her heart.<br /><br />The graphic novel edition is illustrated in the same style as the film adaptation of The Last Unicorn. The vivid, colorful illustrations accurately capture the magical and fantastical nature of the setting and bring the characters to life while giving insight into the characters' thoughts, something that is hard to work into a film.<br /><br />As the illustrations provide for the setting and action, the language is simple and limited to context and dialogue, and so young children will be able to read it as well. I'm so excited about this because it is definitely a story that everyone should read. It conveys so many important messages to the reader.<br /><br />The unicorn possesses a strong spirit within a soft and amiable demeanor and will capture your heart from the first pages. Readers will cry for her as she learns the state of the world and what comes upon humans when they forget the power of faith. And again when a well-meaning magic spell goes awry and threatens to tear away her identity, forcing her to learn the heartache of a human's heart.<br /><br />A poignant tale of love, loss, and magic, The Last Unicorn incorporates themes such as the consequences of greed, the importance of faith, and the need to respect nature. It is also a story of love and knowing when to let go. If you loved the film, you'll enjoy reading the graphic novel edition. If you loved the book, you'll adore the gorgeous illustrations in the graphic novel edition. And if you haven't heard of The Last Unicorn, you should definitely pick up a copy of this! The Last Unicorn will relate to people of all ages and is a read that I strongly recommend.ll adore the gorgeous illustrations in the graphic novel edition. And if you haven't heard of The Last Unicorn, you should definitely pick up a copy of this! The Last Unicorn will relate to people of all ages and is a read that I strongly recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can I say about this series that hasn't already been said?  It's dark, sexy and completely addicting!  The connection between Ana and Christian sends tingles right through your spine.  I litterally could not put the books down.  LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!
0920668372|1.0|After reading high recommendations of this book from a parenting book, I checked it out from our local library. After I read the first two pages, I was moved to tears. But as the boy grows bigger, the story becomes creepier and creepier, and when the mother climbs into the grown-up son's bedroom through a ladder at night to hold him and rock him, the story becomes really disturbing. I really think that the author picked a really bad metaphor to symbolize love between parents and children. It just rubs people the wrong way.  After I finished the story, I decided not to let my 5-year old son read it. I just think that there are much more acceptable ways to show that you really care and love each other, without disrespecting personal space and privacy.<br /><br />I told my son that I read a story where the mother would enter the son's room after he goes to sleep, to pick him up from bed, rock him back and forth, and sing songs of love to him. I asked him how he would feel about it if he was the boy in the story. He said that he does not want to be bothered in his sleep, and would lock the door so that his mother cannot enter his room during his sleep. LOL.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Believable, semi-logical, and well paced. Although it takes it to the extreme, people lack the patience and determination to think through scenarios and take into account multiple variables before acting.<br /><br />Too often we act on emotions and don't care about possible consequences.<br /><br />Life is not simply a random bag of occurrences. The eventual end comes from the decisions we make along the way. We can  change things if we see and plan.
006197806X|5.0|characters' emotions to them. From start to finish of Pandemonium, I have been living with Lena, feeling her anguish, her pain, her desires. It is raw and beautiful.<br /><br />The beginning had me baffled. If not for the chapter title (now), I would have thought I was transported to the past. As I read, I realized that Pandemonium tells the story of Lena (then) adjusting to life with the \\"Invalids\\" and the story of Lena (now) undercover as part of the resistance. Through this, Lauren Oliver both tells us what we want to know about Lena's days after escaping, learning to cope without Alex, and she hits the heart of the story--Lena's involvement with the resistance.<br /><br />I missed Alex. My thoughts were one with Lena in that I didn't want to believe that he could be dead. When Lena runs, desperate to believe that she can bring Alex back by meeting certain goals, knowing the futility of it all, I felt my train of thought reflected here. This. This is where Lauren Oliver's strength lies, in developing character and transferring their emotions through the pages.<br /><br />Lena's recovery takes place both mentally and physically. She is weak from days foraging for herself while fleeing Portland. She is sick with despair over losing Alex. Then, while settling in an Invalid camp, she must learn how to interact with a whole new set of people, and she must learn how to live without Alex. She must learn how to fight.<br /><br />Heartbreak. Love. Desires. Action. Pandemonium has it all. And as with Delirium, Lauren Oliver has left us with a cliffhanger that will nag at the edges of your mind for the rest of the year. Scratch that. The cliffhanger is even more killer than that of Delirium. (Is it possible? Oh, yes it is.) My heart is crying for Lena. Needless to say, I will definitely be reading Requiem, book three and the finale to the trilogy. Until then, I will be rereading books one and two.<br /><br />Have I mentioned that, even as she continuously tortures us with cliffhangers, Lauren Oliver is one of my favorite authors?liffhangers, Lauren Oliver is one of my favorite authors?
B006RUJST6|5.0|Read this on a friend's recommendation. Don't usually enjoy YA as it's a little angsty for me, but this was the right blend of emotional, entertaining and poetic. Loved the description, the setting, the twists and the characters. Enjoyed it so much I asked Colleen to do an interview for my blog, Ladies Who Critique.com, and her answers made me love the book even more. This is a fantastic debut and Colleen is a truly gifted writer who will go very far.
B000MV8XPG|3.0|I got one for my nephew a few years ago but it was the older model.  The excavator is track based and made of steel....a much better model then you see now.  My nephew, who usually destroys all of his toys still has the excavator...I'm not sure about this part plastic one.  I need to buy one for my grandson but would like the old model..if anyone has an older all steel model i would be interested in purchasing.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|I love this movie because it's great for all ages! Tim Burton is a GENIUS! It's creative and creepy, but not scary. I love that amazon allows instant streaming, it's so convenient. I still love this movie and my little sisters had never seen it before so I wanted to show them and they absolutely loved it! If you like this movie I suggest watching 9 (also directed by Tim Burton). Totally worth the money, you will want to watch this movie over and over again.

B0086213XW|4.0|The film is small on words, big on emotions. The acting is suburb by all, it shows that not many words need to be said when you can understand the story through intense emotions.<br /><br />Margot(Michele Williams one of the best of our time) goes through everyday life trying to figure out what is missing in her life. She has a loving husband Lou (Seth Rogen CAN act) that is a charming cookbook writer, however Margot falls in love with a man (Luke Kirby, breathtakingly handsome) she met in a brief moment on a trip, he turns out to be her neighbor Daniel. Margot believes that Daniel (Kirby) is her missing piece. But truly, the real missing piece is the love that Margot should have for herself.<br /><br />There are many directions this film will take you , the real direction is that you must love yourself before you can truly love another.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've bought this book without any research, just by seeing the advertisement on my Kinde (shame on me, i am usually prone to advertisements :-) ). It was a fortunate decision. It's been a long time since i've grown so attached to the characters and stayed up so long to read. The author is solely responsible for my current sleep deprivation. Thank you!

1936608898|5.0|This is the one to get, a complete resource for both the seasoned paleo aficionados or those just beginning the Paleo lifestyle. This book brings together the elements needed to put together a longterm plan that works. This is not a diet, it is a complete life change for the better. I recommend this book to each of my clients and as a kettlebell studio owner, the resources that Dallas and Melissa provide both in this book and on their Whole 9 website are invaluable tools for success! It does in fact, start with food!!<br />Gabby Eborall<br />North Beach Kettlebell<br />San Clemente, Ca.

0345803485|1.0|I didn't like the book at all and didn't read but 1/3 of it before I felt discusted. Gray felt slimy to me. The way he talked to Ana. Ana I felt was just an idiot. Book felt slimy, not loving at all. Not an interesting story in my opinion. Many love the book but it was not for me. Don't mean to be a prude but!!!!!!!!! Sorry I bought the book. It was better in my imagination from what I had heard than it was actually reading it.JUST SLIMY

B0055PGUYU|4.0|The first parts of the book deals with habit of individuals. It is eye-opening, entertaining and informative. The second part deals with habit of organizations. While still a good read, the so-called habit of organization is really just another term for organizational culture and is a subject of many other good books. The third part is about the habits of societies. I felt it's a little flat and the author is stretching the logic a bit by trying to apply the same concept from the first part. At times I felt the subject is no longer habit but something else all together. It's still very informative but not as convincing.<br /><br />Nevertheless the first part is great read and I highly recommend this book.
B002KT3XH6|5.0|I read this book in about a week because it was very good and well written. I really enjoyed it and wish it would have not ended!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I've always preferred the Marvel superheroes to the DC crew for one important reason--character development. Marvel's heroes aren't just one-dimensional superheroes, they're fully-developed characters, people with personalities and histories and lives outside their hero personas. Whether it's the wisecracking playboy genius Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, who's grown up believing his father didn't love him...the arrogant prince of Asgard, Thor, whose father Odin sent him into exile to teach him a lesson and led him to love the people of Earth enough to become their protector...the troubled Bruce Banner, whose inner demons appear in the form of the angry green giant Hulk...Captain America, Steve Rogers, who emerged from a 70-year coma to find adjusting to his new life in the twenty-first century difficult enough without the added pressures of war...or the two elite assassins, Black Widow (Natasha Romanov) and Hawkeye (Clint Barton) who want to atone for the blood on their hands, each character has impressive depth.<br /><br />In The Avengers, the S.H.I.E.L.D. team has been working on harnessing the power of the Cosmic Cube (now known as the Tesseract). They inadvertently open a portal that allows Thor's adopted brother Loki, until now presumed dead, to enter the SHIELD complex and take possession of Dr. Eric Selvig and Hawkeye, physically and mentally...and launch an attack on the Earth. Loki is a king without a kingdom, and he plans to make the people of Earth bow to his will. He's quickly captured, but as he's being transported to his prison, a storm erupts. His reaction surprises Captain America, who asks if he's afraid of a little thunder. \\"I'm not fond of what comes after,\\" he grumbles.<br /><br />What comes after is his brother, the God of Thunder, who has come from Asgard to take him home to face justice there. This results in a heated battle--literally--between Thor and Iron Man. Loki escapes, and the Avengers--a team of superheroes who don't even like each other (except for Black Widow and Hawkeye, who I suspect have more than a working relationship)--must learn to work together to save the Earth. Will they ever become friends? The obligatory after-end-credits scene might offer a clue.<br /><br />I'm fighting the urge to go into detail here. There are so many great scenes, including the death of a long-standing character, but I don't want to be accused of being a spoiler! Screenwriter/director Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Firefly and Serenity) gives The Avengers the perfect balance of heart, humor and nonstop action. The special effects are amazing but don't detract from what's most important in this film. The actors--Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Hiddleston, Cobie Smulders, Clark Gregg and Samuel L. Jackson--are all perfect for their roles. As Mark Ruffalo (Dr. Bruce Banner) said in an interview, there are a hundred reasons why this movie shouldn't have worked--but it does.

B006RUJST6|5.0|This was an excellent book! I was pleasantly surprised as at first it seemed like another face-value, formulaic love story. Somewhere along the lines it gets deeper than that and you realize it's about so much more; love and loss, responsibility, hope and perserverance. The main characters, Will and Lake, were dynamic and very believable. You find yourself right there alongside them in their best and worst moments hoping that they'll find a way to make their relationship work. Additionally, the romantic moments in this book are so well written - not at all overdone - and sometimes leave you a little breathless. They perfectly convey the feelings and raw emotions of the characters in the moment. I would absolutely recommend this book. In fact, I already have! Next up is Point of No Retreat. Can't wait to get more of Will & Lake!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|V for Vendetta is an awesome movie!<br /><br />Every person should watch this movie at some point in their life time. Why? Because the main view of this movie points out how Governments are generally sneaky. Then the movie continues to show the world in which people will eventually live if we don't fight for our Civil Freedoms. If people keeps their mouth shut when a freedom has been stripped away, in fear of Police or Military retaliation then we will slowly be forced into an invisible jail sentence. This movie is great for those who are aware of the sketchy World Issues currently taking place. V for Vendetta also incorporates a bit of England's history making it a great movie.
0345803485|1.0|Not only is this book deeply disturbing, it is horribly written. I don't know how this book became mainstream at all. I am not a conservator person but this book is disgusting and contains not literacy value at all
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm into erotic lit and into BDSM but this was written by someone that has NO IDEA what reality is nor the BDSM world. I tried to read it and got about 30% in but had to return it since it sucked so bad. It is pathetic that it is a bestseller.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple to see and use! The first time I used it, I immediately deleted another calculator app I had. Really cool!
0345803493|4.0|I read all three of the books.  In the beginning I did read all of the intimate sex seens.  However I did find myself after a while skipping through the sex parts and trying to find out more about the characters.  I think a few less orgasims would have made the books better.  I would have preferred learning more about Christians back ground before the submissiveness when he was a child may have made the books more interesting.<br />You have to wait until the very end of the last book to get a very small glimpse of his personality.<br />I'm not sorry I read the books just wish they had a little less sex and more back story.

B00846REIS|3.0|I pretty much read this because a few people mentioned it was as good as or better than Fifty Shades.  So not the case.  It's a ok story with the same kind of guy.  Sexy, rich and of course many issues. I just felt like the book lacked something and I'm not dying to know what happens next.
B0086700CM|4.0|only real complaint is that sometimes the game lags, so you will miss an obstacle but the screen shows different ...really annoying. Also would be cool if there were different backgrounds/tracks to pick from for variety.<br /><br />Overall great game.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|This is definitely one of those albums that requires a listen or two to fully appreciate. Many people listening for the first time have probably bought it hoping for something similar to Make Yourself, S.C.I.E.N.C.E., Morning View, Crow, etc. - the most important thing about approaching this album is leaving those expectations behind.<br /><br />Though I doubt this will ever rank in my top 4 Incubus albums (already occupied by the aforementioned albums), I have come to enjoy listening to this album when in a particularly mellow or introspective mood. The lyrics are nothing special, and in a few cases make the song downright difficult to listen to (Thieves and Promises come to mind), but the music and vocals are really quite lovely.<br /><br />Standout tracks include If Not Now, When?, Isadore (gets old quickly though, I'm afraid), The Original, In the Company of Wolves, and Adolescents.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />Don't buy it for lyrical depth, complex instrumental work, or hopes for a return to the days of an Incubus long past.<br /><br />Do buy it for Brandon's fantastic vocals (he truly does improve with age), a few standout tracks, and the overall mellow feeling this album will leave you with.<br /><br />For me, this album solidifies Incubus as a band that truly does have an album for every conceivable mood I could find myself in. Though I will most likely pick up their next album hoping for something a bit harder, it will nonetheless be on my playlist for quite a while.

B007G5K066|4.0|During the cold war it looks like that is a mole in MI-6. Control (John Hurt) and George Smiley (Gary Oldman) retire after a botched mission. Just because Smiley retired does not mean it is not him. Yet he gets the task of coming back unofficially to find the mole. We go through a multifaceted search. And of course it is supposed to be the last person you suspect.<br /><br />Actually I do not remember that much detail of the series. But I enjoyed watching it.  I assumed this version would have to cut a lot out and might leave you guessing at how they got from one scene to the next. I was wrong. Every word and look had meaning. There are a tad too many flashbacks but time constraints probably force that. For a minute I thought of &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; where there were too many clues. I have to confess I have not read the book so I cannot dissect the differences.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It took a few minutes to get used to the cards, but now I like them better.
B003Y5H5FG|2.0|I saw the original Fright Night in the theater back in 1985 as a teenager and loved it. It still holds up as one of the best vampire movies of all time. This new version is an awful, anemic bastardization of the near-perfect original. It's soulless Hollywood trash with none of the flavor or fun, all the life has been squeezed out leaving just another generic teen horror movie no one will remember. And Instead of nerds being the heroes like in the original, we get beautiful 90210-type people saving the day (of course). Worse, nerds in this movie are treated like worthless losers to be cast aside in order to get ahead in life. Gone are the homages to classic vampire movies and TV horror hosts, replaced by soulless Las Vegas D-bag magicians.<br /><br />Is the new Fright Night unwatchable? No, it's just not very good, like almost everything coming out of Hollywood these days. Even the special effects suck, being really lame CGI. The FX were a million times scarier and gorier in the 80s version! Lest you think I'm wearing rose-colored glasses, I just watched the original and the remake back to back, so it's not nostalgia talking. There's simply no comparison--well, no favorable one, anyway.

B004EPZ08O|1.0|After titles, it got boring way fast, and did I mention predictable? The problem with this series is once you've seen one you've pretty much seen them all and they just get more contrived and unbelievable. The first still the best.
0345803485|5.0|When I read the book, I empathized with the character Anastasia and understood how disconcerting it must have been to desire yet fear her relationship with Christian.  It kind of made me recall the old saying \\"If loving you is wrong then I don't want to be right.\\"
B005OK722U|1.0|While I thought the first Hostel was an interesting story, by 4th installment I'm like what the heck? This is too much gore and too violent to enjoy.

B001GCUO4S|1.0|I gave this one a try, the 3D was all it had to offer, in my opinion. Just so predictable overall.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I painfully read to chapter 8 before I completely gave up and deleted the book from my kindle (if I only knew then that you can return kindle books within 7 days, I would have) The story is pathetic and very juvenile and I found no point in continuing to read.
B004EARTN8|3.0|Kind of unbelievable and farfetched but still maybe worth seeing if you like claustrophobic stuff, goes on too long but has some tense moment.
B007RXC3A8|5.0|I'm an old fan of this band with all of their albums prior to Unia, but I haven't stayed in the loop for a few years.  I decided to check them out when this album was released to see what I was missing.  I guess I got tired of the power metal formula (picked a bad time to stop tuning in to this band didn't I?).  I love the fact that all the songs on this album sound different from one another.  There are a lot of interesting layers.  It doesn't have the same 180-220 bpm power metal beat on every song along with a \\"happy\\" chorus (although there are one or two of those parts on the album).  Because of this album, I ordered Days of Grays and will probably buy Unia.
B0086700CM|5.0|I really like this game it is really fun to play! I have been waiting for this game to come out on the kindle fire and it did!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This was a light, fun, and hilarious read. If you're a long time Star Trek fan, and have a sense of humor, you'll love it.  Highly recommended!
B0015DROBO|4.0|I read this book after seeing the movie. The book, in my opinion, was definitely better. More background and detail. I couldn't put it down. I will be buying books 2 and 3!!!
B0076UXKDG|5.0|This seems to be high quality metal construction inside.  Feels better than the d7000 grip in my hands.  A little overpriced, but I can find AA batteries anywhere, the en-el15 battery is MIA!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's such a fun game and I am truly hooked. I have had no problems with this game at all. My only concern is you have to press the stuff icon to go back to your kindle screen. Besides that such an addicting game to play.  :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant put it down!! its very very very addicting. I haven't had any problems with it. if ur having trouble moving, just turn the sensitivity up in the options.
B0086700CM|4.0|game is great can&quot;t put it down. but the lags got it a 4. since its free can't hurt to go for it
0345803493|5.0|didnt want the book to end, and coulnt wait to see what happen in the end. i cant wait for the other books. loved it.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Flash is absolutely adorable. Since it is a complimentary product rather than an accessorize, getting used to it requires studying the manual and practicing the flash with alternative  combinations. Buttons and other adjustments are a little hard to learn. But i believe above-amateur level photographers will love it and make the most of it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|wow<br />its its amazing and I love orgeon trail . I think this deseverves a 3 sequal y<br />ay for orgeon trail
B007MAETA8|5.0|These are not the songs that you hear one time and think - best song i ever heard.  This is that album that just grows and grows on you - put it into your playlist, and after a day or two watch how you smile when it starts.  Well worth owning.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing.......this game is so addicting i cant stop playing it i am so glad that they finally have this game for the kindle
B0086700CM|5.0|i was really happy when they finally got temple run! it is really fun and addicting so i recomend you get it and dont get temple rum.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|NO stars for this game. Takes 45 mins. to down load. Can't see the items to find em. Can't enlarge pictures. This game is NOT fit for Kindle Fire!!!! Can't beleive Amazon even let it on their website.... Called custumer service 3 times. Guess that about says it all in my opion.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this overall game is extremely good THUMBS UP GLU This game is the best game In the world after angry birds space of course but the bosses are kind of impracticable to beat but the overall of it is awesome! !!!!!!
B007SGM084|2.0|I'm not entirely sure what parts of this are supposed to be \\"kinky sex\\" because....it wasn't all that kinky. I must add it's OBVIOUS this was based off of Twilight. Christian is a reminder of Edward and Anastasia is Bella, basically. Anastasia is written basically the same as Bella, clumsy and plain and nobody is attracted to her. Mind you, guys are falling over for her left and right, but she she feels nothing for them. Christian is...gorgeous and rich. That's basically all the entire books say about him! OH HOW CUTE HE IS! HE'S SO ATTRACTIVE! AND RICH! Not to mention he's a controlling jackass and Anastasia is better off without him. Also, according to this story, she's never even touched herself. That's laughable!  This story isn't worth them money I paid for it. I should have just spent that money on actually buying an adult dvd or something. If you are looking for another Twilight story, this is for you! If not, this isn't for you! There are so many things wrong with this story. It's so horrible it's amusing. The couple have sex every time they see each other and SPOILER ALERT, get married after knowing each other for less than 2 months. This story seems to be written for people who aren't that adventurous in their sex life, as even their \\"kinky sex\\" isn't all that kinky. They talk about how they want to have kinky sex, but never actually have it. I only read this series because EVERYBODY was talking about it. IT WASN'T WORTH THE MONEY! LISTEN TO THESE REVIEWS! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!
B00005NG9Z|5.0|Man, ALICE IN CHAINS is one of the greatest heavy rock bands of ALL TIME!!! Their sound is unique and their videos are INCREDIBLY COOL!!!!!YES, they ´re ALL really COOL!!!! THEM BONES is the BEST video i have seen in my life...Layne and the band look so dark and metal, and the animals fighting....Stay Away is another magic video...FANTASTIC!!! WOW!!!

B004FOA84A|4.0|at first it was easy ablnd as the story thickens it gets harder but way may creative. I love the entire thing. totally worth the money and you should get it!!!:)
030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is one of the most captivating books I have read in a long, long time. I love to read suspenseful novels with original plots. This literally held me captive one weekend, it was filled with unpredictable twists and turns. I couldn't put the book down until I completed it. I don't want to say anymore and ruin the story. Let me end by saying it's definitely a must-read. Enjoy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very easy to use. handy. helpful. I enjoyed the flow and ease of going berween Bible plans and reading random parts of the Bible.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book was somewhat entertaining in the beginng but quickly digressed.  The plot is terrmyible, I forced myself to finish. Poor example of love.
B007ZT2Q88|5.0|Iggy continues to impress.\\"Apres\\", a collection of vocal standards, highlights another facet of Iggy's talent. If you enjoyed \\"Preliminaires\\" and \\"Avenue B\\" then you should enjoy this collection too.
B00114MCAU|5.0|A Disney classic!!! I loved it when I was a boy and I had forgotten how great it was. I enjoyed watching it with my three children and loved to hear them laugh at a movie I watched and laughed at when I was their age. A fantasic night at home with popcorn,M&Ms,and soda. We had a classic movie night that my wife and kids enjoyed as much as I did. Thank you Walt Disney for all the love through the years!! Gary
B0034G4P80|3.0|Although this movie has some entertainment values, overall, the plot is weak and the acting can be at times terrible.  Why kill your own father to save your step dad?  Additionally, I have notice Natalie has gained weight.  I seriously thought this movie is 'the one' and I told my family so based on the Amazon reviews.  Next time, I know better.  Solid three stars and no more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a very easy to read book. Always wanting to read more and couldn't put it down.  I'm a Grandma and it helped put some sparks in the bedroom. People who haven't read it want to know all about, I tell them to get all three and read them.  It has really got a lot people talking about them.
B0080QTZNO|5.0|What do you say about a master? Stephen King is my all time favorite writer.  I've carried this book around with me so much that the cover is really worn. I've read it so much I could probably recite it. More than anything though, I look at this book as a gift to all aspiring writers who admire King. For him to reveal so much to complete strangers is just awesome! And, with all his books I found myself very sad when I came to the last page, I found myself wishing he would just keep talking ;0)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book starts a bit slow and regrinds Katniss' conflict between the two men in her life.  However, adding the new player of District 13 to the picture keeps the book interesting.  The author took the cowards way out by having Katniss virtually sleep through her trial, only to wake up a free woman in the end.  Maybe the title should have been Phoenix instead of Mockingjay.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is excellent quality, there's a YouTube video of a guy using an esee 5 to try and cut through this bk2 and fails it is an indestructible piece of equipment at a third of the price of the esee 5. Nylon part of sheath that attaches to belt sucks and broke in 10 min of wearing but knife is awesome
B003O86FMW|4.0|The heroine, Katniss, must deal with the after affects of surviving the Games in coming to terms with all those individuals she had to kill.  She also must deal with the inner conflict of her feelings between the two male characters in her life.  Oddly, she has an easier time deciding who to kill than who to love.  The author carries this conflict a bit too far and it gets old rather soon.
B0083J8DR2|3.0|I have no idea whta the movie is like, since, the first copy I bought was the ripoff ultaviolet, and this one refuses to load even though all my other videos are playing fine. I would suggest whoever is thinking about buying this be aware that amazons standards seem to have dropped wth what they are allowing.
B0086700CM|5.0|love temple run so much.I like the action in the game. it make me feel like I'm in the actually game. and how we go to try I best not to die but you know we can always play it again . its so fun I love this game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is beautifully designed with delicate, relaxing backgrounds and sounds.  The game levels get progressively harder, and there are a lot of levels to puzzle your way through.  One of my favorite games to play on both my Droid Incredible 2 and Nook Tablet.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've been avoiding wireless headsets in general due to an assumption of lower quality sound, connection problems, and battery nightmares.<br /><br />However, after my cats chewed through the wire on my 3rd wired headset, I decided to give this a try.<br /><br />I have to say, I am very pleasantly suprised.<br /><br />Sound quality is great (at least for gaming), with no hissing or static.<br /><br />Reception is good (still get perfect reception when I wear them outside to smoke).<br /><br />Others say my voice is clear.<br /><br />The surround part works better than I expected--in games I really can sort of tell if a noise is in front of me or behind me, as opposed to just left or right.<br /><br />Charge is excellent, lasting at least 5 hours of constant use unplugged (I haven't tried them longer than that yet), with the ability to continue use while charging via a standard micro-USB cable.<br /><br />Only minor complaints, ones I'd have with any headset of this size--it is quite large, though not too heavy, and the over-the-ear pads actually seal well enough that my ears start sweating after 30 mins or so.<br /><br />And of course, no wire for the cats to chew through.<br /><br />Wish I'd given then a try earlier.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love the new soda guy it so much fun.I always loved this game I hope there will be more games
1936608898|5.0|Let's just start off by saying that I could NOT put this book down.  As tired as my eyes got from being up late and reading all day for work/school, I could not give myself a break and stop reading.  There wasn't much doubt that this book would end up as one of my top choices, but I had no idea how much it would pull me in and keep me flipping the pages until the very end.<br /><br />First off, the analogies are well thought out.  The analogies make the research and evidence behind the material understood by computer nerds, soccer moms, foodies, and credentialed health professionals alike.  While some books claim to have the information laid out mindlessly, the analogies in this book really cement the material in your head.  You can't help but understand the information because you cannot get over how hilarious and true the analogy was.  For example, they compare the highly palatable foods we eat to the Las Vegas strip or our digestion to a dance club.  Yes, they go there, but all in good fun and for the purpose of education.<br /><br />This book not only has the biochemistry down, but has the psychological association with food broken down in ways that I believe can be accepted by pretty much any reader.  It's one thing to know what food does to your body, but having a clear understanding of what it can do to your mind and why you would choose to make such changes is probably even more important.  I have not found any other books that can explain the `hows' and `whys' of food psychology in a way that is as entertaining and concise as It Starts with Food.  The title is perfectly fitting for this very reason.  Food consumption STARTS with food.  Food is not everything.  Even a dietitian will tell you that.<br /><br />You need to get this book. If you are sitting there thinking that your health and future is not worth less than $25, then I have nothing more to say.<br /><br />Get this book for you, for your parents, family, friends, and everyone you care about.  I mean it.  Whether they choose to follow the prescriptions listed in the back of the book or not, the material is solid and the book is a great read.  They may not be into the meal plan or recommendations today, right at this minute, but after reading the book I can promise they will at least start thinking about food much differently. That is a great start.<br /><br />Reviewed by: Stephanie Greunke
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book goes into a lot of detail, some people may not like. The story in fifty shades is very good, I couldn't put<br />the book down.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is amazing and it is very addicting I love temple run you should really try out temple run I love it and you would also.
1936608898|5.0|I LOVE this book and have gifted it to everyone I care about. Dallas and Melissa have addressed EVERY question you might have about how to pile your plate in a healthy way. I carry it in my bag just so I can whip it out when anyone asks me a question about the Paleo diet. Smart, concise, practical, and honest. Get it.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Last year, Rush teased fans with the release of two early tracks from a work-in-progress tentatively titled Clockwork Angels.  And now they're here to deliver on that promise with a towering achievement of sound and scope.  It's breathtaking!<br /><br />From a production standpoint, I have never heard them sound better.  In part, that's because they've found a producer who pushes them in all the right directions.  The lyrics have always teemed with Big Ideas; on this record they're teamed with big-boy acoustics to match.  Husky, chunky bass, thumping, accentuating drums and shimmering guitars never scream indulgent solo, instead opting to flesh out bold textures in the entirety of the canvas, allowing a sweeping array of hues to paint each picture.<br /><br />If Neil is the mastermind behind the album's thematic elements, especially with a forthcoming collaborative \\"steampunk\\" novel, it's Geddy who emerges as the true hero.  His vocals have no longer \\"relinquished\\" the higher ranges but dominate the midrange with a newfound snarl and suppleness.  He has benefited most from the enhanced nuance, his voice feathered, filtered, projected to stunning effect.<br /><br />This album feels like it took Alex, Neil and Geddy their whole careers to make.  A capstone as well as a portal into what may lie in the future, I agree with a lyric that I would not trade tomorrow for today.<br /><br />This has to be their most focused, cohesive effort -- even including Moving Pictures, which is saying a lot.  All the elements come together.  There are no extraneous one-offs, no instrumental mood lifters, no balladic soft filters to offset the breakneck pace.<br /><br />Time has Neil in its clutches.<br /><br />For an entire album we're racing along in a Red Barchetta, embracing the headlong race, leaving the giants of doubt and discouragement stranded at the one-lane bridge to end up with our loved ones in The Garden.<br /><br />As Counterparts explored romance, Clockwork Angels explodesfaith.  What good is philosophy in a clockwork universe?  Love and respect are all we truly have.  Wish the others well and keep moving on...<br /><br />This is the product of a lifetime of soul searching and exploration, of full lives lived with vigor and integrity, even into the darkest detours that few of us willingly enter and even fewer escape with values intact.<br /><br />While the conclusions are sometimes harsh -- hard-won and bitterly cynical -- the lack of solace is compensated by the bracing authenticity with which they're offered.  Here is the accumulated experience of escaping borders and pushing boundaries into the deep unknown -- and taking notes from the breathless journey.<br /><br />Thanks, guys, for taking me along for the ride.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|One must be a true masochist to read this book to enjoy it.<br />Reading this was painful, and not in a good way.<br />The author seemed explorative and not experienced in the subject matter.<br />It implores a fantasy of the author rather from experience.<br />I just had to stop reading it.<br />It is literally juvenile.
B007K3JFUQ|1.0|I am afraid that I cannot agree with the people who say this movie was a great film. It was not.  I loved the first Sherlock Holmes movie: I thought the depiction of Holmes and Watson by Downey and Law were the best I had ever seen.  I eagerly waited for this sequel to appear, fully expecting to enjoy it.  But I did not.<br /><br />Now, I am going to discuss details of the movie here, so I suggest you read no further if you don't want to see such details.<br /><br />First, what was the purpose of having Irene Adler in the movie, only to kill her off in the first 15 minutes?  She played no major role, and was never metioned again.  So why bother to include the character at all?  Furthermore, what was Irene doing working for Moriarty again?  From the last movie she knew he was murderous, could not be trusted and had thoroughly frightened her.  So why in the world would she work for him again?  She was far too smart to have come anywhere near him again, regardless of what he offered.<br /><br />And speaking of Moriarty---the depiction of the character in this movie was more like a cartoon version of a villain than the dark, compelling and ingenious master criminal I was expecting.  He consistently murders anybody who works for him.  Not a smart move for any master criminal to make-----it does not take long for everybody to learn that you cannot be trusted, and that you kill your hirelings rather than pay them.  Nobody would work for you, for any reason.  Moriarty tries to get to Holmes by threatening Watson and his wife's lives.  He sends men with a machine gun to kill the newlyweds, on a crowded train, in the middle of the English countryside.  Really smooth move, there!  Moriarty comes across more like a low level mafia thug than a brilliant criminal mastermind.  And his big, secret, master plan?  Is it a plot to steal the crown jewels?  Counterfeit European currency?  Steal priceless works of art?  Kidnap a royal prince?  No.  He is going to make money by starting aworld war and then selling guns.  I, for one, am underwhelmed.  Many men in real life made fabulous fortunes selling guns without needing to do anything more.  All Moriarty needed to do was sit back and watch the money roll in----completely legal and without all the extra effort. And he would be free to enjoy all that extra money in a world of luxury, not bothered by the destruction of a world war.<br /><br />The movie wanders around looking for a plot, with an excess of fist fights,  knife fights, gunfights,  explosions and general mayhem.  They start out shooting small guns, then shoot bigger guns, then shoot really big guns, and then REALLY big guns.  All of this action might have looked good in a \\"Lethal Weapon\\" or \\"Mission Impossible\\" movie, but looked out of place in a Sherlock Holmes story.  It was boring and ridiculous.<br /><br />Yes,  Downy and Law were great as their characters, Holmes and Watson.  And I loved the character of Watson's wife.  Frankly I think the movie would have benefitted from Mrs. Watson accompanying Holmes and Watson in their adventure, rather than a secondary \\"gypsy girl\\" character.  Mrs. Watson had already proven her nerve and intelligence earlier, and I can only imagine the conversation between the three during the adventure would have been thoroughly entertaining.  But I dearly wish these fine actors had been given a far better story to show off their talents in.<br /><br />Holmes's brother,  Mycroft Holmes is depicted as an idiot and a buffoon.  This man who is supposed to be far more brilliant than Holmes himself,  is reduced to being a bit character and \\"comedy relief\\" with no real part in the story.<br /><br />In fact the entire story staggers back and forth between vicious violence and slap stick foolishness.  Perhaps the makers of this movie thought the \\"comedy\\" would be a good element of the film, but they grossly overdid it.  Holmes \\"disguises\\" himself as a woman, complete with makeup,  then  gets his dress torn off by anenraged Watson, and spends the next part of the movie half naked,  while sexual innuendoes fly thickly. In another scene, it turns out that Holmes is afraid of horses, and is reduced to escaping the country riding a tiny Shetland pony.  During the peace summit ball, Holmes and Watson waltz together in each others arms in full view on the ballroom floor. (somthing that, at that time, would have disrupted the summit even more throughly than an murder, not to mention get them both arrested, imprisoned or possibly shot.)  The \\"humor\\" was such that I was expecting to see people throwing pies and farting in each other's faces.  Comedy needs to be sprinkled on with a spoon, not slathered on with a trowel. Otherwise the result is like something out of  \\"National Lampoon\\".<br /><br />Another example,  Mycroft Holmes (an English gentleman of the upper class) is seen wandering blithely and completely naked through his home in front of Mrs. Watson----another man's wife, who is currently a guest in his home and under his protection.  This scene would not be funny if it took place in modern times---but in a story placed during the time of Victorian England?  It was barely acceptable for a woman's own husband to be naked in full daylight in their own bedroom with her!  But wandering around in the rooms of the mansion, in full view of the guests and servants?  This reduces it to the level of slap stick.<br /><br />At the end of the film, Holmes is off with Moriarty, leaving Watson to stop an assassin from disrupting a peace conference.  Watson stops the assassination, but the conference is very much disrupted, and we never see or hear of any resolution to the scene.  Was war prevented or not?  We are not told.  And the infamous death scene, were we have Holmes and Moriarity going over the falls completely fails to be either dramatic or emotional.  I heartily wish that movie makers would stop jumping on that weak plot device.  Arthur Conan Doyle had Holmes go over the falls in his original story, because he was tired of his character and wanted to be done with him.  It didn't turn out, and so Doyle had to cobble together a story to bring Holmes back to life.  Doyle did not consider either story to be his best work, or his favorite.<br /><br />At any rate, this movie was a disappointment. I can only hope that, if another one is made, it will be better than this one was.  Why, so often, does it seem that the first movie is great, and then the next one stinks?<br /><br />If you are eager to see this movie, as I was, I suggest you rent it and not waste money on buying it.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this game is a blast. Challenging enough to keep your interest but not frustrating. The graphics are great and the game plays smoothly.
B0086700CM|3.0|While this game is amusing, I would not classify it as a five star game as so many have done; it is average at best.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loved this game from the first time I played it and it was awesome, so I downloaded it and now I can play it anytime I want to.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Let's be honest, you're either a fan of Geddy Lee or you can't stand his voice.  There really isn't any middle ground here.  While I love 'Snakes & Arrows' and think it's one of their best albums 'Clockwork Angels' has a lot to live up to.  After repeated listens of S&A that album just got better and better and even though I've heard \\"Caravan and BU2B\\" numerous times and in concert this album will undoubtedly get better and better as I listen to it each time.  For now, a five star album and that isn't because I've listened to Rush since the beginning.  This is a great album all around.  While some fans want Rush to keep delivering \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" the band has learned to evolve with time and age.  Geddy Lee,for me, sounds better today than he did in his early years and while it may be that the guys don't pump out an album every year or two they still deliver when they do.  I'm more than thrilled to hear 66 minutes worth of new music from the band.  And while they might not have delivered the epic song on this album combine \\"Clockwork Angels\\", \\"The Anarchist\\", Carnies\\" and \\"Halo Effect\\" and you just might have your epic song clocking in at 22 minutes.  One reviewer (trash review) compared Geddy Lee to Elton John as time has marched on.  So off the mark that it's laughable.  Has anyone heard Elton John sing lately? Maybe Geddy Lee has lost his shrieking or the high end but his voice still remains intact and he doesn't need a host of back up singers to sing on any of Rush' songs.  Overall, for any Rush fan this is an instant classic.  Great job guys and looking forward to seeing you live in the Fall.<br /><br />On a side note to all the \\"fans\\" who have posted the one star reviews.  I must be listening to an entire different album than you. I listened to it again today on earbuds on my iPod and am thoroughly enjoying this album.  I just don't understand what's not to like on this release.  As far as Geddy's voice, I guess I'm missing where he's singing horribly because I just listen to 'Headlong Flight' and his vocals say it all there, especially near the close.  If he couldn't sing, he sure couldn't do that.  But once again, I guess the one star reviewers just want another repeat of 'Tom Sawyer' or 'Close to the Heart' or 'The Spirit of Radio'.  Time to get out of the past.  If you can't, then just listen to those albums over and over and over and over......... and over again.ging horribly because I just listen to 'Headlong Flight' and his vocals say it all there, especially near the close.

0345803485|5.0|When I read fiction I want to be entertained, be emotionally involved, care about the characters, and be compelled to turn the page. This book ticked all those boxes and then some. So I loved it. In fiction I am not looking for socio-political commentary, role models, or morality lectures. I get that in real life. So I found this book a fun, engrossing escape.<br /><br />Plot Summary:<br />Innocent college grad Ana is pursued by young, handsome billionaire Christian. Every girl's dream? Not when Ana learns he doesn't want a girlfriend, but a submissive to share his BDSM lifestyle.<br /><br />My opinion:<br />The \\"erotic\\" label is because it deals with BDSM lifestyle, but the focus is on the romance, not the erotic elements. The eroticism is mild compared to others in the genre. This isn't a criticism, I find relationships are far more interesting than mechanics. I've read plenty of \\"hotter\\" books I can easily put down because I don't care about the characters. These characters I cared about.<br /><br />After the characters started throwing off sparks (at about p. 79), I could handle the angst. Until then, I wondered if I was going to finish it. There are things I disliked: the over-the-top angst, the overuse of exclamation points, the Briticisms, redundant phrasing, referring to a vagina as \\"there\\", and sometimes you want to just slap the characters--and not in a good way. But the characters were true to their insecure, F-ed up selves, and that I really appreciated. Basically I put up with things I don't like because James knocked stuff I do like out of the park: I couldn't stop turning the page, I cared what happened, I was emotionally involved and thoroughly entertained. And I loved the ending because it didn't follow romance formula. And I'm twitching to get my copy of \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\".<br /><br />I also really appreciated the focus on the Dom/sub contract. I've never read anything this detailed about unenforceable contracts in BDSM fiction. (If you like reading BDSM erotic romance, I also recommend \\"Natural Law\\" by Joey Hill and \\"Sweet Persuasion\\" by Maya Banks.)<br /><br />(On a side note: I applaud my local library (Hennepin County, MN) for carrying 336 copies when most libraries ban the book as porn. To that I say people scare me in their ignorance and willingness to control other's reading. Also, if this is porn, my Honda Civic is a luxury car.)

B002N8A14M|3.0|I finally had an occasion to use this product for the first time this past weekend when I went for an hour walk and wanted to listen to some music.  The armband itself is good -- it is easy to slip on and rather easy to tighten using the velcro.  I say \\"rather easy\\" because when I tried to tighten it with one hand, the armband itself moved around my arm.  It took a couple of attempts but I got it positioned on my upper arm the way I wanted.<br /><br />My only problem -- and it's a BIG problem for me -- is that if your Nano 5G happens to have a skin on it, it will not fit into the plastic case.  This was very disappointing and frustrating for me.  I wound up having to use the Nano belonging to my significant other -- her iPod does not have a skin on it.  Even when I applied a reasonable amount of force, I could only get my iPod into the plastic case about halfway.  Any further attempts would have either damaged the plastic or the skin on my iPod.<br /><br />So, to sum it up, if your iPod Nano 5G has no skin cover, this product is perfect.  Otherwise, avoid it and try something else.
B0064BWE8U|4.0|This is definitely not Sophie Kinsella's best book, but was still worth reading. A little far fetched, but still cute and entertaining. I enjoy reading her books.
0071752854|5.0|This book was amazing!  It completely changed the way that I view a \\"sales\\" interaction - especially when I am on the selling side.  I used some of his techniques to land a contract with a major educational institution in my area.  I actually couldn't believe when I was doing it how easy it was, and how well it was working.<br /><br />I will definitely read it again, to reinforce the techniques in my brain.  Anyone who has any kind of role where they must convince another person, (whether in a sales interaction or not), should - no MUST - read this book.<br /><br />I have seen the author speak in person, and if you have a chance to see him, it is well worth it.
0756405890|5.0|As a big fan of fantasy novels (The Warded Man series, A Song of Ice and Fire series, Harry Dresden books) I can honestly say that this was perhaps my favorite of them all. I did not really know much about the book before starting, but within the first 50 pages, I was hooked. Patrick Rothfuss builds an amazing world in which, Kvothe, the main character/hero narrates his legendary (and notorious) life story.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much of the plot as it is so much fun to read and be surprised yourself, but the first book of this series focuses on Kvothe's childhood and education at the University. If you enjoyed Harry Potter's coming of age at Hogwarts, than I am sure you will enjoy this much darker, much more adult, version by Rothfuss. Kvothe is a character that I immediately related to. You can't help but cheer for him during his numerous ordeals. The book is filled with demons, dragons, magic, unrequited love, and more. The book is quite long, but the 600+ pages will fly by in a day or two.<br /><br />If you are looking for memorable fantasy novel, this is your book. The worst part is the turning the last page. I can't wait to read book two!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is so fun!!! its a great game to kill time. its really good on the kindle fire!!! so good
B007MAETA8|4.0|I really like the direction John Mayer has taken with this new album. Very organic, acoustic, and mellow. To top it off, his excellent guitar work is top shelf. I highly recommend this to any diehard John Mayer fan or anyone who likes classic album rock.
0385342063|4.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Total page-turner!  I'm a sucker for happy endings but Sophie Kinsella masters the trauma before the happy ending in all of her books.  I'm a complete fan of her work and have bought EVERY SINGLE BOOK. She's an awesome storyteller!!!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I appreciate the historical accuracy of the fictional book, I certainly learned much from this book.  The characters were interesting.  The story line was not choppy.  I think the author could have left out some of the sex scenes.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is the best Rush album since what Signals maybe? every track is good and i love the steampunk concept.
0345803493|3.0|The story is a constant repetition. Nothing new ever happens with Ana and Christian Grey. You find them arguing most of the time in the beginning of the book about how Ana is not compatible for him. Ana acts very childish, and this is just not amusing for a character like Christian Grey. A lot of the material the author puts does not seem to b very original, and makes the reader bored too soon. Everyone is in love with Ana, and this of course again gets boring. Overall, the book was a repeat in a sense of the first one, and is not worth to continue this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|like this app. the new update solves some issues. the characters are great and like the challenges. no need to buy things with real money
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I must say that I was disappointed in the movie. I saw it at Cinemark XD-RealD 3D, which I believe may be like IMAX 3D. The 3D was super, and I enjoyed the visuals. I felt that the acting was more than adequate.<br />  However the plot was a complete mess, from beginning to end. I could not understand the beginning of the movie, the middle, and the end. It is hard to be detailed because I am trying to avoid spoilers. I could not understand the motivation of the characters and the story was not easy to follow. I was shocked that the plot was so poorly written.<br />  I love science fiction, the Aliens franchise, and Ridley Scott. Believe me that I was looking for reasons to like the movie. I would rate this movie a C-, which I define as viewable but would not be motivated to buy the Blu-ray. The movie felt like it was motivated from the Aliens franchise but did not really add anything to that universe. It also was not drawing on enough of the Aliens movies. It was worth seeing in the theater, but not more than this. The Amazon rating of 3.5/5 is probably fair.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just wanted to write a brief review: it's great! Easily worth the money. Buy it!! (But don't leave the Silo!)
B0086QS7N2|2.0|After all the promise of the early releases of \\"Caravan\\", \\"BU2B\\", and \\"Headlong Flight\\", the remaining tracks fall way, way, short. The 3 tracks mentioned will all find their way one day to the complete compiliation of RUSH greats, and stand very high among them, but the other 9 are equal to 3 strikeouts in this inning of their career. They just did not hit any nerve or stir any emotion. And it's especially dissappointing after coming off the masterpiece that Snakes And Arrows was.
B0086700CM|5.0|If ur looking for,  adventure and awesomeness this is the game for u expecially of u have a kindle fire like me
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|Love never dies has beautiful costumes and dark, eerie and spellbinding sets.  To me it was almost too dark and eerie  at times. Every character was so dark and Emo. It truly actually made me depressed by watching it lol. It kinda reminded  me of a dark, dark version of Moulin Rouge.  Never the less, it's worth watching. Would I purchase it and watch it over And over? No.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The game keeps me playing game after game. I've only tried the one suit games though. maybe because I can actually solve them.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I'm almost ashamed to say that I finished the trilogy. It is an easy, almost mindless, read. That's about the best I have to say for it. There is little or no plot. The dialogue and description are repetitive; the closest thing to love that these characters understand are their insatiable appetite for sex, and their shared desire to control the other person.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Have always enjoyed Solitaire and I enjoy this one. Yes, ads do come up between each game but there is always an option to skip or close them. No biggie to me.
B007UWBGVS|5.0|when I first heard the album I was a little unsure....I love Adam Lambert and I love his voice. I decided to listen to the music and the lyrics a few times. It got me hooked. Now I realise what ADam wanted when he made this album and I am so pleased with what he has achieved. Yes it is a modern pop album and not like his first album. But unlike most pop albums there is meaning to it. There is an incredible powerful voice behind it and there is a wonderful intelligent man singing it. Also when he performs the tracks they transcend normal pop music. They are wonderful funky and raw. I absolutely LOVE IT>  Thank you ADam you always deliver xxx
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Let me just start with the Ultraviolet copy crap. I personally don't buy movies for the digital copies, I buy the dvds(and sometimes Blu Rays) for the movies, nothing else.<br />I took my dad to see this sequel on the first screening. We are pretty big fans of the books, t.v. shows and other movies(possibly). We love the first one, but when we saw it, I don't think I've ever seen him laugh as hard(he never really laughs during a movie)as he did during this movie, A Game of Shadows. One of the very few movies that completely surpasses the 1st one in pretty much every way. My brother, who doesn't really care for movies like this, actually liked it quite a bit.<br />I won't give any spoilers, for anyone who hasn't seen these movies. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll love the 2nd one. As for watching it in theaters, the end had the whole room laughing!! Hard! Even my dad laughed quite a bit. This movie is a must own in my opinion.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'cw been waiting forever for this game to be available on the kindle Fire. I love it and am extremely addicted to it.<br />WARNING: This game can be extremely addictive.<br />(but it's so worth it!)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are addicting and fun to play.  I recommend this to everyone that likes mini games to pass time quickly or who wants to sit for awhile and play multiple types of games
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I was 7 years old when I awaited the release of Different Stages, 13 when I saw them on the Vapor Trails Tour, a Jr. in High School when Snakes and Arrows came out and now as a \\"mature\\" adult I've witnessed the release of  Rush's latest masterpiece.<br />  I have to say it sounds nothing like anything Rush has ever done and that is in no way, shape or form a bad thing. The coalescence present is unlike anything I've heard before on one of their albums- they truly went out on an artistic limb and it looks to me like we are all staring in awe. As we should be.<br />  5/5  Caravan<br />  5/5  BU2B<br />  5/5  Clockwork Angels<br />  5/5  The Anarchist<br />  4/5  Carnies<br />  5/5  Halo Effect<br />  5/5  Seven Cities of Gold<br />  4/5  The Wreckers<br />  5/5  Headlong Flight<br />  5/5  BU2B2<br />  4/5  Wish Them Well<br />  5/5  The Garden<br /><br />Very impressed with this album! Excellent!!!!
B007MDQW3W|5.0|In my opinion when I start to like a musical artist's music, their next album usually doesn't live up to the album(s) before.  Regina has been an exception!  Like many fans I started to love Regina when Begin to Hope was her latest album and everyone loved \\"Fidelity\\".  I devoured this album, went to her concerts, she was my favorite.  Then Far came out and I didn't think it was possible, but I liked it better!  She did it!  Believe it or  not, I feel like she has released an equally great, if not better album in \\"What We Saw From the Cheap Seats\\".  Her quirky lyrics are genius and real.  And I can't stop listening to it.  Buy this album.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so fun and addictive. I can't seem to walk away from it. Definitely earns five stars. Love it!
0375869026|3.0|...but I couldn't. Here, I'll explain why.<br /><br />First Sentence: I know I'm not an ordinary ten-year-old kid.<br /><br />How I Acquired the Book: Borrowed from my town's library.<br /><br />The Review: When I first read the synopsis of this book, my thoughts instantly turned to a friend of mine who had a facial anomaly, just like the main character, August, in this book. So I was excited to read it, to get a glimpse of what my friend's life could be like.<br /><br />In that aspect, it did not disappoint. Auggie's voice is brilliant, and you can tell R.J. Palacio definitely spends a lot of time around kids. Auggie sounds just like my friend when he was in fifth grade, and is highly believable. It is this that makes the book so heartwarming and realistic. A book full of Auggie would be great.<br /><br />But this book is /not/ entirely full of Auggie. The first and last 80 pages or so of it are AMAZING, definitely the best parts, because they're told from Auggie's point of view. But the rest of the book is told from different characters' points of view, like Auggie's friends and family. This just does not work. Each character gets 20 to 50 pages, and as I just was getting used to and liking their voice, BAM, the point of view changed again. In the middle of the book I found myself scanning the book to get to Auggie's part more quickly. Not only that, but the plot is lost in these parts, and these supporting characters are not well-developed.<br /><br />That said, I completely respect and admire Ms. Palacio for doing something so ambitious. It may have not been the best it could be, but Wonder has absolutely raised my awareness and sympathy of people like Auggie. While this novel doesn't deserve a standing ovation, I will be waiting to see if Ms. Palacio's next novel deserves one.<br /><br />-reviewed by a teenager. (I apologize for any teenagery and/or snarky comments in this review, if they have offended you. I understand they can be very annoying, just like teenagers themselves. In any case, thanks for dealing with them and thanks for reading this review.)agers themselves. In any case, thanks for dealing with them and thanks for reading this review.)
B0013FSXT6|2.0|As a warning: the bluray is defective that I bought. It stops midway through the film.  The picture quality is awful. Don't think that just because it is a bluray, that it will hidef -it is no better than a standard dvd. Very dissappointing. Hope this helps. As for the film, well, very slow.  Not sure the point of this, long pauses in dialog.  Otherwise, interesting pornographic look at jealousy and it's effects.
B0086700CM|4.0|get this app, and then try not to play for the next hour! this is a very additive game and really is super fun and of course the price is right.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game but the touch is defenitly buggy and some times it makes you waste energy while building something because youn tapped too many times... :(
B007L3BMGA|4.0|The story follows a girl called Ana, who goes to interview this big-time entrepreneur in place of her best friend because she's ill. When Ana locks eyes with the extremely luring Christian Grey, she is immediately drawn to him. Coincidentally, he shows up in the store she works in a few days later looking to buy some supplies and she ends up setting up a photo shoot for her best friend with him. As things go on, she finds herself falling for him but he is definitely not what she expected him to be. It turns out that he is heavily into BDSM and he wants to control he in every way. Shocked and curious, Ana must decide if she is willing to do this one thing for the man is she slowly but surely falling for to make him happy.<br /><br />I literally finished this book about 5 minutes ago and I have no clue where to start.I have never read any sort of book like this before so I didn't know what I should expect. But holy, it was extremely descriptive! The author literally talked you through every single time they had sex, in excruciating detail. I'm still slightly undecided how I feel about the book right now. It was ridiculous but at the same time, addictive. There was nothing that wowed me about E.L James' writing. I have definitely seen better but I have also seen worse.<br /><br />I think what shocked me the most was how Ana was actually considering doing this stuff with him. I wouldn't mind if she actually had sex with someone else before and had a bit of knowledge of what she was getting herself into, but she didn't. At all. And Grey assumed she WAS experienced, just because the way she spoke to him in the interview. Big shock for him when she told him she was a virgin. But even after he showed her his 'Red Room of Pain' and all of the sex toys, she was STILL interested even though she barely knew this man since she only met him a few days before hand. It just doesn't make sense. For all she knew, he could of been some crazy, psychopathic rapist. Any sane person would have ran for the hills but, no. Not Ana.<br /><br />I didn't like the way she fell for him instantly. Like I said above, she barely even knows this guy, then suddenly she's madly in love with him and it will kill her to be away from him for too long. I can't stand when females are weak and helpless like that. I would have much preferred it if there was actually a full buildup to her falling for him, but it was literally just sex. He wouldn't even let her touch him for Christ's sake. We also still don't fully know why either. There was only one time in the book where I felt like they had a deep connection and that was when he brought her gliding. That was by far my favourite part of the story. I was actually smiling whist reading that chapter.<br /><br />Despite what I said above, in some weird way that I don't understand, I still liked the book. I liked the general plot line. It was new (to me anyway). Even as I'm writing this, I'm completely torn on what rating to give it. And like I said, it was extremely addicting. I finished it in no time at all, which I thought was good considering it was over 500 pages long. I enjoyed the ending too, it was a good cliff-hanger and it really makes you want to read the next book to see what happens.And with that being said, I finally settled on a rating.have ran for the hills but, no.

0345522303|2.0|Giving only two stars to a novel by Lynn Flewelling makes me unhappy, but bumping up the rating for nostalgia's sake alone doesn't seem honest. Ms. Flewelling's first three books about Seregil and Alec still rank as some of my favorite fantasy novels of all time, but the magic is definitely gone at this point. (Minor spoilers follow.)<br /><br />So if you've already read some of the other summaries of the book, you know that there are conspirators involved, and a mysterious plague. These are some of the clumsiest conspirators you're ever going to run across: they use simple ciphers that can be decoded at a glance, have zilch by way of security at their homes, and talk about treason out in the open where they can be easily overheard. They are not subtle, they do not have a single spy of their own in Rh&iacute;minee as far as I can discern. In a word, they're incompetent. (Strangely, Prince Korathan seems to suffer from this same lack of spies and competence. One gets the impression he would have no idea what's happening in his city were Seregil and Alec not there to inform him.) The plague is just meh, and comes with its own uninteresting bad guy attached.<br /><br />But the saddest thing is what's happened to the main characters here. They're not interesting, either. They are shallow, they do not develop, they have become less clever than they used to be. (Examples: Alec somehow gets surprised by a pack of bluecoats while sitting in the street pretending to be a beggar; back in the day, he would have seen them coming and made a clean exit. Seregil should have twigged to the identity of the unknown swordsman when he saw the same guy again the next night at the theater; here, he has to have the answer shoved in his face.) It feels like our heroes are just going through the motions, from one plot point to the next, with minimal emotional investment in any of it. Suspense is almost nonexistent. I had a hard time getting through the book.<br /><br />If you're a real fan of the series, I suppose you'll want to read this novel just to be thorough, but it might leave you feeling pretty let down.series, I suppose you'll want to read this novel just to be thorough, but it might leave you feeling pretty let down.
0060936223|5.0|This story stays with you long after you have finished it, and you wish that you could read it again for the first time.  I struggle with many autobiographies and biographies because although they may be well-researched and cover an interesting topic, they are terribly written.  From the first line of this book, Patti's writing captures you with beautiful and well crafted prose. Her story is engrossing from both a historical and cultural prospective, and simply on its commentary on love and friendship.  I may just have to read it again today.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I purchased the 3D Blu-Ray version of this movie and couldn't be happier.  This is a fascinating story!  Yes, there are strong \\"action elements\\", to be sure, but to call this an \\"action movie\\" would be insulting because there's so much more.  The story is clever and beautifully paced.  I liked the adventure, and the elements of discovery.  And I loved the scenery.  I even went back afterwards to study them along with the architectural features.  (It's amazing what 3D technology can do).  The alien creatures and cultures were as believable as any out of Star Wars, actually, even more so because their customs seemed more believable.<br />Overall, I think this movie is one of my all time favorites and give it my highest rating.  I am also planning to buy the \\"Art of John Carter\\" book because I found the set designs so fascinating.

B000020617|5.0|This was my first Foo Fighters album I ever bought.<br /><br />I bought it back in 1999 and was blown away by all<br />of the songs on it, esp. Aurora, Headwires, MIA, Next<br />year and Learn to Fly.<br /><br />This is one of the few albums where I actually like<br />and can listen to all of the songs on it.<br /><br />The songs are just great, well written with unique<br />riffs and, at times, solos to name a few awesome<br />thing about this album.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album for any Foo Fighters<br />fan. Plus, it has extras such as the music video of<br />Learn to Fly (quite funny to watch) and a few other<br />extra's that you can enjoy if you put this CD into<br />your computer. Plus if you buy this new, it comes<br />with a free temporary Foo Fighters tattoo :)

1936608898|5.0|I am co-owner of a Crossfit gym and we follow a Whole 9 approach to paleo.  We have had a Whole 30 challenge at our gym with many success stories.  I wish I had read this book prior to the challenge as it would have helped me to guide our clients through the experience a little better.  The book does a wonderful job explaining why we should eat this way and how to do it successfully.  Completing the Whole 30 myself has helped me to take my paleo way of eating to the next level.  I sincerely appreciate what this book has taught me and the positive changes it has made in my own life and my clients.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm still shocked by this book. The writing is so bad and the plot so plodding that I just cannot fathom its popularity. The hero likes to use a whip in the bedroom, but other than that little quirk, he's an insecure bore who really should just pay for some therapy already. The female narrator likes to say \\"holy crap\\" over and over, so that we understand that something earth-shattering is going on. She also likes to talk to her subconscious and her inner goddess. But her most annoying, and horribly frequent, habit is chewing on her lower lip. Of course, that last tick drives the hero wild with desire. Anastasia is 21 years old, has never been drunk (yet somehow drinks quite a bit in this book), has never slept with a man (has never even been interested in men), has never owned a computer (or, it seems, had an email address before this guy comes into her life), and prefers to hang out in the library reading the classics. She is so naive and dull, it is impossible to believe that any wealthy man-of-the-world would be interested in her. Yet, he's obsessed. Christian is described as fabulously wealthy and gorgeous, but he lacks any depth or personality -- other than being scarred for life by some horrible childhood experiences that he has yet to deal with. This is a very sexually stunted and insecure man and, thus, I found him completely unappealing. Maybe these two dullards are perfect for each other. But they are so uninteresting, the plot is so thin and yet agonizingly drawn out (is there ever a point?), and the writing is so clumsy and awkward, that I just cannot imagine why people are wasting their time and money on this.

B0015AARJI|5.0|..my previous outlook on this controller is at the very bottom. this is part 2,notice the difference in paint quality, lets get on with this.<br /><br />..well well... it has been a sojourn. it has been an oddessy mixed with knotted veins on the forhead and rewards nary so valuable, with this controller. at last for the past two days since the accessories arrived ive been working with this controller;charge/play cable,blue tooth dongles, and wireless keypad all together.<br />for what its worth.. despite the small wear-and-tear i can see on the wireless ps3 device, its in good working condition-ill just state to the court before going on that it would not have survived if i had owned this at age 10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/19/20/21/or 22- and everything works well.. that said.. the illusion that it or parts of it dont work, is mind boggling. for the last couple weeks as ive tested this..feww[...] i came..THIS 99%/99% close, to asking for a refund for the controller, and then subsequently asking for a refund for the wireless keypad, dongles and wire, as i was sure this had become a wasted time and money fiasco because that was the way it was.<br /><br />..but.. if you have the will, and the patience, not to reach for the steel bat nexr to you in your room you feel so very much like bringing right down on this controller with all your might-keep this in mind;<br /><br />..there is, if at all, very little being done for this kind of hardware. thats the price of an entity like sony who sold every fiber of themselves to the fiery down below for as much wealth as possible.and WHAT IS being done, is being worked on by third party people(and what a party, let me tell you) who without the massive rebobinar funds like sony unfortunatly has, work on the existing software slooooowly. motion joy.. xpadder... if you have these.. they are not bugged. they are not glitched(most of the time).. they are full of quirks. yet they are like the cells powering your body. you cant run thiscontroller without them. it is an obstacle with these programs combined with this hardware-its impossible without them. patience. if you should ever come across this difficult terrain as i have and conquered, patitience will prevent you oh buyer from flinging every part of this things hardware back at its sellers from far across every part of the world.<br /><br />the wireless ps3 controller sold here-at least the one i got- is by no means a fraud. a fake. a sham. nah(although it does seem like they get these from the used asian goodwill store, dont fret though)<br /><br />as someone who uses this controller soley for the computer, the dongles cable and wireless keypad ive purchased all work. on a pc laptop. i will be posting similar reviews in all the seperate components i bought particularly, which you can see under my name, as they all work for this wireless ps3 controller.when using this with a pc, you need motion joy and xpadder which will work.(avoid the updates. yove been warned about that now)<br />old republic here i come.<br /><br />five star rating. making the bottom review old and void.<br />end communcation.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />[..going to write another review but the following account of woe is as follows. please read this very thoroughly and carefully to understand the 1 star rating.<br />on the date of writing this review i joyously ripped open my weak and silly metal mail box to find what ive been waiting for, for days-the ps3 wireless controller. awsome, no?<br />i take it back to my house, thinking of playing alone in the dark and soon old republic with this, and oh the memories that will come.<br />i open the package, pull out the controller- and air follows after. um.. theres.. nothing to connect it to the computer. n.o.t.h.i.n.g. air. zip. nata. squat. ralvmungio.<br />so..why bother sending the ps3 controller..if you never had anything to connect it to...? a usb piece thing?... a cable perhaps..? it makes the very thought of the saying ''until tommorow'',all the more tickly, in my fist. theres..nothing but the controller in the bag. i could raise an ant farm in there and theyd never find anything but the air that comes after they open  the bottom.<br />heres how it goes. until i find that cable-usb whatever you use to connect a ps3 wireless controller to a pc or playstation 3-whatever- my rating for this product is 1%, and i suggest to not buy it. however should i find whatever you need(a..cable? its..wireless. wireless. wheres the usb part. i bought this..because its supposed to be WIRELESS!!!!!!!) to make this work.. ill raise that to a 5 star restaurant rating.<br />until then.. consider this my current evalutation until the last part of this god forsaken story comes to a close the way it was meant to be.<br />..but seriously. dont off-handedly include anything about a usb cable unless its included. jesus crist..<br />(when i get the last part whatever it may be, the second review makes this one ineffective at that point, so read this very carefully]<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I started this series I was like everyone else a little skeptical of what I was getting myself into, yes there is a lot of S & M but taking a deeper look into the book it really becomes this story that you want to know more and more about. Totally intriging. I read the whole first book in just 2 days. I didnt want to stop... now onto the second one!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This has easily become one of the best books I have ever read. You don't feel overwhelmed by huge chapters, but they're not too short either. If I could be a writer, this is the book i'd hope to write. You feel so connected with the characters, you cry when they're upset and smile when they're happy. The entire time I was reading, I could vividly imagine what everything looked like, as if I was there. Ransom Riggs is extremely imaginative and creative in his writing, as a photographer, I loved the photos in the book. They completed the whole story for me. I would recommend for everyone to read this book, I've already bought copies for friends & family members.
B00783NWB6|3.0|I watched the 3D version and the effects of explosions and the like were good. Storyline was interesting but not mindboggling. Acting was to be expected of an action movie. A good yarn for a slow night but nothing to rave too much about.  But it was enjoyable for what the Underworld franchise could offer and certainly better than number 3.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|what's visible and known:  4%<br />dark matter:  cannot be seen, its existence only a hypothetical inference:  23%<br />dark energy:  another hypothesis, helps explain the the observed acceleration of the universe's expansion:  73%<br /><br />the ratio here between what is unknown and what is known is thus 24 to 1.<br />and this ridiculously outsize ratio represents the leading edge of thought in the most mathematically precise (and perhaps paradoxically, most mathematically creative) of the sciences.<br /><br />\\"One might say that each time reason encounters something unknown, it tests it to see if it is truly the boundary of reason.  There is no natural limit to this imperialistic expansion of the scope of reason, unless reason does encounter something that is truly beyond its capacity to grasp.  Kierkegaard argues that such an encounter could be viewed as the fulfillment of reason's quest, and not simply a defeat, because 'the ultimate paradox of thought' is 'to discover something that thought itself cannot think' (Philosophical Fragments, p. 37).  It is the passionate quest to find this limit that lies behind reason's restless and relentless search.\\"  (Kierkegaard, An Introduction, p. 156)<br /><br />Not completely related of course, but to get to the point of the review, reading back through these notes I have to admit that buried beneath that awesome movie, somewhere within that unfortunately disappointing story, there was a bit of reasonable motivation for the characters of Shaw and David.<br /><br />David was by far the most compelling, however.  How can you not be fascinated with an android who (that, which, I admit confusion over the proper term here) loves Peter O'Toole as Lawrence?  Although not as overtly emotional and physical as Shaw's quest, his was quietly much more desperate.  And to brutally paraphrase Hugo, desperation in combination with intelligence is worth serious attention.  I hope his character is given greater scope in the next episode.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is extremely well done and entertaining! Gives an interesting perspective of both sides of English life (above and below the stairs).
B007J4T2G8|3.0|While this book is not within my usual genre of reading, I wanted to see what the hype was all about in regard to this book. I read the sample from Kindle and thought that it was decent writing and might be a good read.<br /><br />Overall it was a decent read. The characters appear to be overly complex, but I felt that they were still mostly predictable. And well, the sex....there really was just too much of it, but I knew that going into it. I admit that I skimmed through some of it after awhile. The sex was fun to read sometimes, but then I just wanted to finish the story. Seriously, it was too much sex for me, and I am far from a prude.<br /><br />It is, however, a very fast read. The author knows how to put words together and knows how to make the story intriguing enough that you never want to put the book down. I was nearly halfway finished with the book within a day and probably would have finished it if I didn't have other things to do.<br /><br />I'll probably read the other two in the trilogy sometime (mostly because my OCD is to finish books in a series unless they're really bad), but for now I'm going to go back to other books on my reading list.
B007PBL9KC|5.0|An awesome indie band from Iceland.<br />I had heard \\"Little Talks\\", but was surprised to find that there are so many other great songs on here.  Plus I picked it up on Amazon for $4.99.  Great debut album!
0345803485|1.0|I can't believe this book has got the attention it has. I've managed to force myself thru 1/2 of it, now it's gathering dust on my floor.

0345522478|4.0|In the first Iron Druid book, we meet said Druid, Atticus O'Sullivan. He looks to be about 21, but you can add a couple of zeroes to that, though if this is how most druids lived, it is a surprise any are left. He's likeable, a pleasant sort, as is his Irish Wolfhound, Oberon, to whom he communicates telepathically thru magic. The dog is smarter than you'd expect a dog to be, though not up to a human adult, save maybe Dan Quayle or Joe Biden. The book moves quickly, and we meet some interesting supporting characters, a werewolf pack, a vampire, an old woman widowed by The Troubles in Northern Ireland, relocated to Arizona. That said, they and the villains are a little shallow. Hearne has been compared to Butcher's Dresden Files - the hero seems to have some similarities in style, but the plots are not as deep or intricate. A lot more are personal grudges than real diabolical plots. That said, we get too many gods killed off for my taste - if they are gods, or higher beings, you'd think they'd be a little tougher, or they would not have lived since pre-Christian times. A loose end or two are left, and some open ends for characters that may return, but not every book has to be a heavy,elaborate plot, right? Some good humor (\\"So, your attorney is a bloodsucking vampire?\\"), including a nice remark about genius to open the book, some graphic violence, and the sex is alluded to, not actually written. I'd give it a 3.5, but it moved well, so I will throw Oberon a sausage and round up to a 4.

0307951529|3.0|I really loved The Art of Nonconformity and Chris Guillebeau's work in general. I got this for young adult children, as I'd like to instill them with entrepreneurial spirit rather than waiting for someone else to create work or give them a job. But even though it's well written, it was somehow lacking, and seemed more geared to people who have online businesses -- especially the lengthy \\"launch\\" part. That seemed almost completely geared to people who are launching e-books or similar electronic products. It was page after page of what other people are doing but not very much about how they started; the nitty-gritty of running with an idea in today's world. Once again, love Chris and will look forward to his next book, but if I could have given this 2 1/2 stars I would have.
B004L03B3S|3.0|Although the film was very well acted, scripted, and really a beautiful film.  It seemed as if it would never end.  Yes, the two half brothers were very close, and I guess that made the film controversial, but most of the drama came from them being apart. It did make for a good movie, but nothing near as dramatic as one might expect.
0857207113|5.0|What an inspiring book!  This lady is remarkable and so brave for choosing to share her dreadful experiences with the world.  I challenge anyone not be be totally moved and, at the same time, horrified by the recollection of her time at the hands of her captors.  I can only imagine the fear she must have felt but yet having the strength to endure the suffering and degradation for 18 years before finally being reunited with her mother and sister which must have been almost surreal.<br /><br />I have never read a book in two days but this was totally captivating and I was humbled by Jaycee's bravery and maturity in the face of despair and loneliness.<br /><br />If you have children, and even if you don't, I would urge you to read this.  It is a hard read at times because of the honesty and detail in her description of events but it will make you realise when you feel that times are hard that life can be a whole lot worse!<br /><br />My heart and admiration go out to Jaycee and her family.

0765350386|5.0|At its core, Mistborn is the story of a revolution.  A thousand years ago the Lord Ruler saved the world from the Deepness, but now he's a tyrant who's practically immortal.  Under the Lord Ruler's reign, a class known as the skaa have been subjugated and enslaved.  They are too beaten down to rise up until a charismatic man named Kelsier begins to stir up trouble, devising a risky plan to overthrow the Lord Ruler.  He's aided by Vin, a street urchin with Allomantic powers.<br /><br />One of the things that I love about Brandon Sanderson's novels is that he treats magic as a natural process that operates by certain rules.  In this book, the magic system is called Allomancy, and involves ingesting certain metals to fuel one's powers.  If you run out of metal, you run out of magic, and if it's in the middle of a fight then you're pretty much screwed.  This means that while magic is extremely powerful, it's not invincible.<br /><br />I found myself quickly getting attached to the main characters, but Sanderson even Sanderson's minor characters are fully fleshed and complex.  My favorite is Sazed, who studies and preserves knowledge of the many religions that have been suppressed by the Lord Ruler.<br /><br />I can't stop gushing about how fantastic this book is.  It is one of Sanderson's earlier novels, and his writing is a bit better in The Way of Kings, but the story here is engaging.  By engaging, I mean that there is no way to stop yourself from reading the last 200 pages in one sitting, regardless of what previous plans you may have had.  It's impossible to put down.<br /><br />Oh, and unlike most books that are part of a trilogy, this one has a definite end to it's story arc while still leaving room for the other two books.  I like that.  I get very frustrated when books don't end.  It's one of my pet peeves.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend \\"Mistborn:  The Final Empire\\" for anyone looking for a well-written and captivating fantasy novel.

I have season 1,2,3 on Netflex. Can't wait for season 5 in September. The sad thing about that is you can only watch it one episode a week.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|A 17 member crew of a starship awake just before landing on a distant planet where an unknown species seeks their demise. A boat load of excellent special effects, subtle to the eye Real 3-D and well blended audio surround track with punch are the highlights in this 2012 prequel \\"Prometheus.\\" Based on the 1979 sci-fi smash, \\"Alien,\\" this prequel falls a little short of what movie goes have come to expect from legendary/visionary/director/producer, Ridley Scott. In this action pack yet cerebral shaker, Scott attempts to bridge mankind with the God's of Mythology while at the same time trying to end \\"Prometheus\\" where critical acclaimed award winning \\"Alien\\" begins. Considering Alien was released 32 year before Prometheus, I think it possible some people just won't get it. Yet for die hard fans of \\"Alien,\\" Ridley Scott does connect the dots but we have to assemble the pieces. Scott now 74 may not be making many more films at his age, so a ticket to see \\"Prometheus\\" is worth it, just to see the brillance of Scott at work. Other great works by Scott, \\"Gladiator,\\" \\"Thelma & Lousie,\\"  \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" \\"Kingdom of Heaven,\\" \\"Robin Hood\\" (2010) and more. Prometheus stars, Noomi Rapace, (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pierce. Couch Potato Review? 5 potato 6 potato.

B0000793Z9|4.0|***Note: this review refers to the X5 CD which contains this album plus six bonus tracks: Promised You a Miracle (extended); Glittering Prize (club mix); Someone Somewhere In Summertime (extended); Soundtrack For Every Heaven; New Gold Dream (German 12\\" remix); In Every Heaven***<br /><br />Simple Minds' fifth release \\"New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84)\\" is a transition from the old to the new.  While some of the ambient, trance, and instrumental sounds stretched out into something new are here in bits and pieces they are largely subdued and suffused with a more honest and open alternative pop sound.  You frequently can pick out what instrument is creating what sound on this album and soundscapes are created for the purposes more of melody than of making musical photographs or stories.  Many fans may decry this but it is this new venture that gained them their most significant popularity and helped to propel their longevity.  The album's leadoff track \\"Somewhere Somewhere In Summertime\\" is going to be the track that sticks out the most strongly in people's minds when they think of this release; it carries an accessible sound and is a strong preview of what is to come on near future releases.  Still, at this point in their venture they are a bit awkward in their popular-leaning sounds.  The overall mood of this album by way of the music and Kerr's vocals is upbeat, positive, and lends to a sense of living and thriving.  Mostly gone are the dischordant elements previously and frequently employed on their earlier albums.  But you still find the remnants of these sounds such as on \\"Hunter and the Hunted\\" where more natural and typical musical sounds are offset by alternating synth sounds that tends to have an effect of confusing the ear; also \\"King Is White and In the Crowd\\", the album closer, is a throwback to the first three albums, especially \\"Empire and Dance\\"'s sound, and along with Jim Kerr's unusual vocal delivery (shouts and pops--sounds he's making) it ends the disc with a disorienting feeling.<br /><br />I found the highlights of this album to be the funky, fun groove of \\"Colours Fly and Catherine Wheel\\"; the playful and twisty \\"Big Sleep\\"; and the surprising, hopeful, and light \\"Glittering Prize\\".<br /><br />The additional mixes don't add a whole lot to the proceedings but certainly pad the time out.  \\"Soundtrack For Every Heaven\\" is okay as is \\"In Every Heaven\\" but nothing phenomenal.with a disorienting feeling.<br /><br />I found the highlights of this album to be the funky, fun groove of \\"Colours Fly and Catherine Wheel\\"; the playful and twisty \\"Big Sleep\\"; and the surprising, hopeful, and light \\"Glittering Prize\\".<br /><br />The additional mixes don't add a whole lot to the proceedings but certainly pad the time out.  \\"Soundtrack For Every Heaven\\" is okay as is \\"In Every Heaven\\" but nothing phenomenal.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Well, I received this package, opened it up, and everything looked official, as it should if you seemingly order something from \\"Sony\\", however, this was sold by a Third Party Seller.  Upon opening it, i notices minor marks on the controller itself, the official product sticker on the rear of the controller was so sloppily applied that I could no longer believe this was a true official PlayStation 3 accessory, then underneath the \\"official\\" sticker on the rear, I noticed a small circular sticker, that is not on official PlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 controllers. I plugged in the controller, still hoping for the best, and jumped right into game, and immediately found the buttons had a completely different feel than that of an official controller, and the down button on the directional pad barely worked, and I had to really give it a good press in order for it to work.  Then I started playing, and that's when my heart sunk.  It was clear that there was a noticeable difference in my gameplay. I had in Need For Speed Hot Pursuit, which I had been playing earlier in the day before I got this controller. I was racing fine, having no problems before, but then I used this controller, and I could barely make turns that before I had no problem making, and it is in no way possible that my gameplay can decline that much in a matter of a couple of hours.  It was such a noticeable difference that I immediately packed it up and got it ready to return the next day. It was a well made counterfeit, but that's all it was, was a counterfeit that did not work properly and was defective in comparison to an actual official controller.<br /><br />NOTE: I consider myself a serious gamer, and have been playing for many years. Noticing these differences is very easy for me, and may not be easy for inexperienced gamers. If you are looking for a cheap replacement and not too serious about gaming, this product is for you, although, I would recommend getting something such as a Mad Catz controller, since they use cheaper materials, but work like a great controller should (usually).  But be warned, this WILL affect your gameplay, and very noticeably if you are a serious gamer.<br /><br />The official PlayStation website suggests that Wal-Mart sells a brand new official controller for only $39 which is a little bit more than this controller, however, because it is sold through Wal-Mart, you can be assured that you will be buying and official controller.
B006GX3ONK|5.0|Why is Simple Minds' \\"X5\\" a five star product?  Let me break it down for you:<br /><br />For betwen $20-30 bucks you get 6 CDs with 75 songs, 8 of which were not released on the original albums.  You get Simple Minds' first five album collections, including the stellar \\"Sons and Fascination\\" and \\"Sister Feelings Call\\".  The packaging is compact with each of the discs in a cardboard sleeve with the original vinyl album artwork on it (I purchased all of their early albums on vinyl and I enjoyed this nice throwback touch).<br /><br />Every album here is not a 5 star album but for the price point and for those out there who haven't completed their collection or for those who are curious this is an absolutely great bargain and not one to pass up.
1936608898|5.0|I now have the much better book to recommend to my patients. It Starts With Food will be the first resource I recommend to all of my patients for information on health and nutrition. This is primarily because the pages have a fantastic tone. It sounds right. It is upbeat without being like a cheer leader. It has the science, but described in a way that people can understand. It includes the all important focus on mental aspects of making change, which other books conspicuously leave out. I really like the four health questions that they discuss which should be asked about each food.<br /><br />If you are looking for an all around book on nutrition, then I would buy this book first.

The real secret is closer to home.<br /><br />Technology, the daughter of science, is seen by many as the secret. It ain't! Aldous Huxley called technology, a self transcendence downwards; this means that technology will slam the door shut on the secret. The Buddha is not in the machine, you see, the Buddha is inside you and I. This is the secret that Huxley was hinting at.

I suggest we do the same! There is more purpose to your inner secret than consuming the pap from Rhonda's udders. Think yourself God Almighty instead!<br /><br />You being God Almighty and purpose go together like bread and butter. You are THAT is less easy to knock over than the other by being that, because it puts you back in the cockpit, that is, YOU are in charge of your life vehicle and so why fear? The other guy feeds off your fears and your desires, so don't (overly) desire and don't fear; observe your surroundings; the guy is not in the room with you now; you are. Your body is always present, your mind is not. Your mind is somewhere else. Take back your mind! The bank manager may have you by the balls, but he has forgotten who he is and he has no idea who you really are. This is by far the more sophisticated of the contenders to your purse and your sanity; YOU are that is especially good at breaking the dogmatism of priests and the superstition of science; the shackles of man-in-the-sky monotheism and the illusion of the rat race because, in reality, the real secret guided Erwin Schrodinger and Albert Einstein out of dead materialism and all right thinking people go for this clever idea (ignore the flag waving from the kingdom outside) and so we have the licence right there to be babbling optimists, seeking our maker from within. No wonder Erwin Schrodinger would finish his lectures by declaring that he was God Almighty\\" to that bemused Christian audience, and he was a Nobel laureate remember! So if he can say it then so can you!<br /><br />This is not a new idea; mind, it is the old doctrine of Tat-Tvam-Asi, or 'I am that'. Lunacy, maybe, but in the East, this is the cement of universe. How about it, you only live once; so shall we all declare that we are all God Almighty? If you cannot accept your spark of divinity, then tell me; is this not a better view of seeing yourself? Rhonda Byrne reckons she's the Almighty, so you better start with your own self gratitude, and fast. What other view is there, now that the God of the sky, who hung the stars like lamps in heaven, is dead?<br /><br />The Secret begins within, rather than out there. You can now start feeling better about living on this wretched planet. This Secret, I hope, will benefit the reader and reach the parts Simon Cowell and Oprah cannot reach.<br /><br />You can stop lifting your satellite dishes aloft like begging bowls to be filled by Oprah and Cowell. They only want to bleed you dry through shopping and adverts. Take back your mind!<br /><br />Anyway, this is why I am writing about the real secret, not just because it sounds good, but, as I mentioned above, most mystics came to this idea independently of each other, throughout history and they never charged a dime for it too. Not only does this secret come with less baggage, it is full of meaning, God and science have little meaning now. The word God shuts down the mind and science entangles the brain, meaning cannot do this; meaning opens the mind, to the secret.<br /><br />These ideas will make you feel better about being here; they really will. Special relativity won't do this to you and neither will Barack Obama. This is the higher happiness, not in a Prozac way, but in a concrete way. People mix up happiness with euphoria, but euphoria is canned happiness, rather than concrete happiness. Rhonda Byrne is selling euphoria. Concrete happiness is the real happiness because it lays foundations that stick like cement. You never see euphoric people happy all of the time, but this is the version of happiness pumped out of the entertainment industry. Concrete happiness is the thing the Dalai Lama has. His Holiness always has a big grin on his face. He knows the real secret.
B0086700CM|5.0|Wow, when I saw that Temple Run had hit the market for Amazon, I was immediately overjoyed to not be left out by the iPhones. It didn't download to my phone correctly, though it is an older phone, but when i played it on my Kindle Fire, it was perfect! I'm still going to rate it 5 stars even though it did not download to my android because a Kindle Fire is meant for games and an android is made to do more plus the regular cellphone stuff. For being free, I really think this is one of the best deals you will find! And if all else, you can download Bump and bunp it over to your Apple products without spending the money :)

B0079XPUOW|3.0|This had a very interesting and humorous plot, and I enjoyed the book right up until the end.  The email portion I thought was boring.  It's almost like the writer ran out of time before the release date and needed filler.  I really like this author and pre-purchased the book; it wasn't all I had hoped for.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I am so pleased with this album by Adam Lambert.  I have the 12 song album but want the deluxe version as it has a couple more songs.  His voice is amazing and I love his heartfelt ballads as much as his catchy and so danceable  grooves too.  I hope he has great success and finds happiness and satisfaction in his life for years and years to come.  Great work on a great album.
B001NZVS8E|5.0|Wow! This album brings me back to high school! I just loved this whole album, Blink-182 was the best part of my life as a teenager, even this day all grown up, I listen to their music. But this album is the greatest! I love Alien's Exist! There's just something about that song that just kills me! I love it! yaaaaaay!
B007TBCTRK|1.0|He goes from arguing with Jerry Goldsmith about the original and returns (cuz it is a prequel, b-tches) to the franchise with this horrible excuse of a composer in Mark bore me half to death Stringfield or Butterfield or whatever his name. I realized he likes using the dude but he must have a special relationship with the guy cuz he's zero on talent.<br /><br />My god, mood mood mood. no theme. Nothing to remember. The best of the score was written by someone else. Go crawl under a rock, Mark. Obviously you got intimate with someone to get your gig.<br /><br />Such a big movie and such a small soundtrack. What a waste. Thank god I was able to listen to this sh-t online and save me from buying it. Your a worthless piece of garbage, Mark, and I remember what you did in '99, you s-umbucket. You still havent been forgiven for that, weasel.<br /><br />AHHHHHHH! I hate this. No one can make a lick of music these days. I wanted to go another planet with this soundtrack. All I went to was the basement. Seriously. Its like a step above a slasher film soundtrack. Just give me those old Mancini Friday the 13th scores instead. Those had more life then this unending blight of bore.<br /><br />Snooze your way through this and you'll love it.
1936608898|5.0|Dallas and Melissa Hartwig first detail the science behind their recommendations, followed by reviewing foods and food groups based on their \\"good food standards,\\" then go into their Whole30 program and transitioning into maintaining lifelong good eating habits.  This is followed by The Meal Map: a formula-based cooking approach that provides a wide array of various tasty, nutritious recipes that can be made quickly and easily- the key to sustaining a diet that is  replete with a large amount of whole foods.<br /><br />This book is well done and the only diet book one would ever need to maintain lifelong health and vitality.  The scientific explanations are very accessible.  The criteria they developed for selecting healthy foods align with my practice of functional medicine.  They look at foods and food groups from four different aspects: psychological effects, hormonal effects, effects on the gastrointestinal system, and immune/inflammatory effects. I have used their Whole30 program for many patients in my practice with repeated good results.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

B0073PPKNM|1.0|[[ASIN:B0073PPKNM The Absence]][[ASIN:B0073PPKNM The Absence]]I absolutely loved Melody Gardot's first two albums and have been waiting so long for her next recording and I pre-ordered it as soon as it became available. The CD arrived today and I am very disappointed in it. The music itself reminds me a bit of Tom Waits of whom I am a big fan but this just does not work for me and I do so hope that Ms Gardot returns to her old formula for her next album.<br /><br />Charles Stone-Tolcher<br />Australia

B004TSXUWY|2.0|First of all, I must congratulate the author with an original and interesting piece of fiction - for a first time novelist this is no small feat, and he did an admirable job in creating a story that is interesting.  As other reviews here have noted, the story is about a British woman entering middle age with no memory.  She awakes each morning completely disoriented (there's a man in the bed next to her!) and has to be told that she is married (to said man) and proceeds to reconstruct the rudimentary knowledge to get through the day before she goes back to sleep at night where she loses her memory again.<br /><br />The plot becomes more complicated when an enterprising young doctor recommends that she start to keep a journal as a means of therapy, keeping track of what she learns, as well as hopefully triggering long repressed memories that she will be able to recall and build upon.  It is here that the reader must make a leap of faith - because as the journal entries continue day after day, the writing becomes more and more detailed and we have to believe that she finds time to not only write these accounts in stolen moments throughout the day (long hand, mind you), but is also able to find time to read the journal each morning to re-learn what she has since forgotten.  I found myself too often while reading the novel losing credibility for the story because of the length and amount of detail her journal entries become.  Yes, the story was interesting, but if you don't fundamentally believe the means of conveying the story is possible, it just wore a bit thin for me.<br /><br />Without giving away the twist at the end, I found overall the book to be a disappointment.  However, I do think the writer has talent, and wish that he is able to create another novel that doesn't stretch the reader's credulity to the point of exasperation.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love the game because it is fun and also calming.  I finished quell and was glad this game was here as well.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm having a hard time getting through it. Although I like the fact that there is sex and S&M, which makes me want to keep reading it, the writing is not capturing my attention. I haven't gotten far into it yet so maybe I should've held my review until the end. I really hope the girl grows a backbone.
B0064BWE8U|3.0|All her characters are becoming pretty much the same - except Sadie the Ghost in Twenties Girl of course - and I just didn't love this book. It's an ok book, no more than that.. and also hard to read the bloody footnotes on an iPad.  Perhaps best suited for hard cover.  Would I recommend it at full price? No.  Get it from the library.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|While a dull book could have been forgiven, the characters were flat as well. Diana certainly told the reader (and every character in the book) that she loved Matthew, but I certainly never felt it. I never understood why, I was never captivated by the romance. I didn't like Matthew and couldn't understand why Diana did. He wasn't sexy to me, he wasn't interesting, and while I actually did find the science and history explanations quite fascinating, I bought this to read a romance.I will not be reading the next book in this series.
B0050VA428|5.0|Who can complain, it's the real Shurlock Holmes.  No one can top Doyle for the best, nothing like the new movies with more action and violence and not enough deductive reasoning, which is what Holmes is famous for.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|.......that a band can stay together for 37 years (Starting from Fly By Night, their first with this line up) is amazing.<br /><br />The fact that they can still put out a decent album of new material is astounding.<br /><br />The fact that their following wants to hear NEW material rather than a greatest-hits set is beyond astounding.<br /><br />The fact that they can put out an album THIS good so late on in their careers, well that's just not fair.<br /><br />While tired old greatest-hits bands like Def Leppard, ZZ Top go top up their bank accounts with jukebox like short sets every summer, these guys are still playing vital new material in 3 hour shows.<br /><br />This is a prime example of why the ALBUM is still the best format for music listening.<br /><br />Put away your ipads, ipods and laptops. Stop texting for a few minutes, guaranteed there will be nothing urgent to respond to.<br /><br />Get the lyric sheet out. Put the CD into your music system or, preferably, put the record on your turntable and crank it.<br /><br />Read the lyrics, don't multi-task, and re-discover (or for the younger crowd, discover for the first time) what it's like to listen to an ALBUM, old-school style.

B003CIG7AE|4.0|If Gram had not overdosed and lived to join Eagles this would have been the result. Great melodies and harmonies with a minstrel quality. Competent rhythm section. Lyrics are very good, but not the poetry of early Jackson Browne or the creativity of Conor Oberst (but as good as Eagles). Excellent production match for the vintage sound they produce. Considering what passes for music in 2012, this is a refreshing dose of excellence. I hope they stick around for a long time, and avoid the pills and needles that have done damage to so many gifted artists over the years. One of the few bands these days that I would go to see in a live performance.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is, for me, the perfect film. I've read the books now but hadn't going in to see this, so I'm judging the film on its own merits.<br /><br />The atmosphere throughout is tense but exciting. Even without much of the explosive action typical of modern films there's never a dull moment, particularly because the pacing is so effective. Events for the most part move along briskly but each scene is fleshed out and the slower, softer parts of the film are given the time they need. The film as a whole is very streamlined without being rushed.<br /><br />What makes this film so memorable are the powerful but never overdone moments of real drama and emotion. The actors are fantastic in this regard; curiously, so much is conveyed without lines of dialogue but with character's expressions and looks. As well as the two leads, Liam Hemsworth in particular is worthy of recognition for this, and I look forward to seeing more of him in the sequels. James Newton Howard and T-Bone Burnett's rather low key but beautiful score (of which I've written a separate review) perfectly complements and helps to accentuate the drama and emotion in every scene.<br /><br />I love the characters themselves and it's a joy to watch their relationships develop throughout. Again, the actors do fantastically (it took a few viewings for it to sink in quite how wonderful JL's performance was) and the script/directing deserves extra credit for allowing the actors to bring the characters to life with their actions and expressions as well as their lines. And thanks go to Suzanne Collins, for providing the original source material.<br /><br />It's rarer for a film to hit perfection than for a book, especially with regards to emotion and characterisation. For the most part, only the author is involved in writing a book, whearas a film relies on the contributions of the actors, scriptwriter, director, the musical score, and so on. But The Hunger Games got it just right, and when a film does that, I don't think it can be surpassed.<br /><br />ETA: I keep seeing people reccomend that the book be read before seeing the film. I saw the film first, and I have no doubt that I enjoyed it more because of it. Not knowing what was going to happen next or how the characters would develop was so much of what I loved about this film. I'm sure some people might get more out of reading the book first, but it IS possible to see the film before reading the book without \\"missing out\\".
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an awesome app. I've seen it before on my friends iPod. This was the second game I got

B007N85ZXY|3.0|As cover album go, this is all right. Its nice that Young hasn't done a Johnny Cash, by re-imaging contempary songs, but taking on old American Folk songs, which is interesting, considering he's Canadian.<br />Highlights would be \\"High Flyin' Birds\\" & \\"Wayfarin stranger\\".  Lowlights,  \\"God Save the Queen\\", I think Hendrix has cornered the market on national anthems!<br />Production wise, it has a \\"Chrome Dreams 2\\"  although I feel the studio banter between the songs sounds a little contrived.<br />So I think this would be classed one of his\\"experimental\\"\\" Albums, Which is why we love Neil young so much.<br />As for the score, if it was out of 10, I would give 7/10, but it's only five so I can only give 3/5 (its not worth 4/5)<br /> Oh, if your into Covers Albums, you may be interested in \\"Meet Glenn Campbell\\"
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|After reading an article mentioning that Tom Cruise was set to take on the character of Jack Reacher, and commentary ensued discussing whether or not he was suited for the role, I wanted to see what the fuss was about. Killing Floor was my first look at Jack Reacher, and I was hooked. It took me a few pages to get used to the short, choppy language used by Lee Child, but once I did, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Reacher is a bad ass. He's flawed, which makes him all the more interesting. While traveling around the country, he stopped at a small-town diner, and was arrested for murder, before paying for his meal. That sets off a series of events, and non-stop action and violence ensues which appeals to the male reader. There's a bit of romance and touching incidents that appeal to the females, as well. It's an all-around entertaining, and suspenseful read. After reading this, I checked out the Second Son to see what the character was like as a kid. Goes without saying, Jack Reacher was born a bad ass. Not sure Tom Cruise matches the description as depicted in the books, but we'll see.

B008AG3PK8|4.0|I've truly missed Betty's character throughout this season. She has been a crucial part of the MadMen series and going an entire season with only a tiny glimpse into her life isn't fair.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|These are impressions I typed up after seeing it last weekend.<br /><br />- Overall Rating:  8.5/10<br /><br />5 of us went, and we went to a restaurant after and talked about it for an hour.  After we did I asked for ratings out of 4.<br /><br />Me - 3.5/4 (I upped my review above to 8.5/10 which is close to 3.5/4.<br />Wife - 3.5/4<br />Brother - Initially said 4/4, then backed off to 3.5/4<br />Male friend - 3.5/4<br />Female friend - 3.5/4.  This one blew me away, because I thought she would HATE this movie.  It's not up her alley AT ALL.  She said she liked it because it was tense and adult, not like Avatar.  Those were her words.  I asked her about the xenosnake going down the guys throat (she was squirming like crazy during that part) and she said she loved it.  Go figure.<br /><br />- Awesome FX, great 3D, amazing design, amazing filming/cinematography.  No debate there.<br />- The main story is pretty simplistic, it parallels Alien (and unfortunately AVP).  The difference is the whole spiritual subplot...and I think that needed some more work.<br />- Needed more engineer action IMO.  They were under utilized.  The surviving engineer is barely in the movie.  The engineers were in the first and last shot of the movie but kind of ignored as the central antagonist of the movie.  Really disappointed in this aspect of the movie.<br />The xeno scene at the end was both necessary and completely unnecessary at the same time.  I really wouldn't have cared one bit if they'd never tied this to Alien at all.  I was perfectly willing to keep this completely separate.<br />- I still maintain that the central story is about Weyland even though he's barely in it.  Everything David does is because of Weyland.  David has no agenda or motivation beyond that.  Everything Vickers does is to defy her father.<br />- The motives of Holloway and Shaw are secondary (yet more interesting, and left mostly unexplored and fleshed out).  I'm hoping the sequel will explore this side of itmore since Shaw seemed damned determined to find out.  I wished they had focused on either Weyland's quest for immortality OR Shaw's quest for the mysteries of life/creation.  Mixing them together led to both being muted.<br />- I found the acting to be pretty solid (Fassbender stands out as everyone has said).  There are bad lines, but that's not the fault of the acting.<br />- I find movies that create questions to be just as satisfying as those that spoon feed us the answers.  The Fountain is like this.  A million questions but I still liked it.  Prometheus is in the vein.<br />- Fox marketing really screwed the pooch on the trailers.  They DID show way too much.  The viral aspects have been brilliant though.<br />- I think this movie was cut in the hope of a PG-13 rating, and they barely missed it.  I assumed there was way more gore and horror than was shown in the trailers.  But there isn't.  Which begs the question...why can we see almost all the gore and horror in the trailers yet it gets an R rating?  I think a lot of good bits are sitting on hard drives somewhere.<br />- Wanted:  Extended director's cut.<br /><br />- Lastly...I will never spoil myself as bad as I have on this movie...ever...again.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I don't think I will ever understand how people can take these stories seriously and then actually worship the jealous, hate-filled, lazy god described in them. You really want to give someone credit, how about humanity! I don't see how those kids who teased a bald man really deserved to be eaten by bears nor do I understand how god could get mad because HE allowed his other creations to mate with mans daughters and then kill all of humanity save for one family.....then insist that that family is to inbreed to populate the earth again. if that seriously happened why are we different races? Cane's decendents are dead now because of the flood....wtf! Anyone who takes this junk seriously needs their head examined!

B001NLKT60|4.0|This sequel to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is amazing.  I found it easy to get into the book and didn't want to put it down until I was finished.  It is a little graphic as was the first one, but I definitely recommend it.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is a great app for work and personal use. You can view the notes you make as post it's all over your screen or as lists. I have created check lists for meetings, reminders as well as taken notes during meetings. Either way, you can easily email the note you create to yourself or anyone else. I was also able to security block some notes if needbe. Great app for keeping you organized. The ability to change the notes colors or organize yourself by the color of the notes you create is an awesome feature as well. I use it almost dailey. There does seem to be a limit on the length of the notes, although a page plus should be sufficient for some. Just hit the back arrow on the bottom of your kindle fire and this saves the note. Can not copy and paste notes or lists into other documents, but if you email the note to yourself, you can copy and paste into other documents that way.
B007NKLUV8|5.0|What more can I say, other than this is a \\"must buy\\" if you are a fan of melodic progressive music.  Steve and Chris have created great modern progressive music that builds upon their classic roots.  Though it doesn't have very long suites or epic pieces, it has great songs that pull you in and leave you wanting for another listen.  The title track is especially moving with soaring harmonies, a great melody and great musicianship.  So check this release out.  Top shelf musicianship, great songs which can bring joy to your soul!
B00005614M|1.0|Poor recording. I played it on my vacuum tubes system and it sounds flat while \\"kind of blue\\" and \\"best of Miles Davis and John Coltrane\\" fills the living room and it sounds like an orchestra hall.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Simply written, not much depth to characters.  'Love' scenes -I almost put the book down and couldn't read anymore.  But then I picked it up again so it must have captured my curiousity and interest.  Reading #2 now,  it has much more 'story' and not as much S & N.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Another book by Nicholas Sparks that grabs one's interest at the very beginning.<br />While it isn't my very favorite of Spark's previous books, it is a good read.<br /><br />One of my areas of interest in reading a book like this is that it contains no violence and a book to enjoy that doesn't create tension or great drama which makes me read for relaxation! I read other books which are full of good informative information, however,Spark's books are a wonderful \\"fill in\\" when my mind needs a plain ole diversion.<br /><br />I would definitely reccomend any of Nicholas Sparks books to those with the need to just read for entertainment. The Lucky One is just that!
B005LAIH5O|1.0|Never mind that this movie takes mythology and twists it around until it is unrecognizable, the CGI effects and the noisy soundtrack seem tailor-made for adolescent boys who just want to see things blow up.  When the characters hit each other it sounds like a car hitting a wall.  Childish, stupid and embarassing. And the acting? Don't ask.
B0002KQNL8|4.0|Remember this zombie movie is a comedy and not extreme gore. I love this series to death. I read the reviews from people and they really cut down this classic zombie movie. It's like 1 and 3, really hilarious. I like the 2nd one the best, had me laughing so hard it hurt. But I really suggest not reading reviews and judge movies for yourself. I used to not watch horror movies that people gave bad reviews and put done what they said were the worst parts of the movie. I found out by eventually watching the movies that they were actually great movies and my favorite scenes were the scenes that people seemed to hate the most. I hope people are not this critical about my novels.

B0084YBLUC|4.0|This was a visceral season. There are several scenes I winced and I'm no shrinking violet. The duplicity and social expectations equate to a group of together yet divided assemblage of characters. Subtle symbolism, brilliant costume design and steady revelatory character development remain unchanged from previous seasons. Story continuity arcs but remains consistent.<br /><br />Paul Kinsey goes Hare Krishna, while Harry gets one in the kisser after giving it from behind over his desk. 'Alas, whining, unlikeable Harry is a true friend to insecure, whinier Paul.<br /><br />Lane crosses the line out of pride and desperation, aided by a drunken banker. Cooper foreshadows Lane's bitter future in this episode.<br /><br />The costumes are quietly telling. Don's lapels grow narrower, with black, blue and silver striped ties. Pete moves from bold blue suits to drab, conservative black suits. He and Don swap more than attire, they switch lives. Pete riding the train to the suburbs to his hum-drum family life and eerily familiar house interior. Don enjoys life in a swank apartment in the city with his lovely new wife. Although Don's tenuous acceptance of his role as the Man In the Gray Flannel Suit is challenged by Megan's youthful opposition to consumerism, seeking actualization in acting not advertising.

B001NLL93W|5.0|i really enjoyed this book!. it really made me think about it after i was done with it. i felt that cassandra clare really knows how to write a great series also a great city. i really enjoyed knowing more about Idris and picture the city.<br /><br />the plot really made me think about the book and the characters. i felt that it went in the right direction with the build up of the clave and the insquistor trying to blame the lightwoods. also learning what Valentine was up to.<br /><br />i really grown to love clary and enjoy her character development in all ways. she is really growing up and learning more about the world, she never knew. Jace really mad me made in this book with his action and what he said to clary, but he did it for the right reason, which shows he is amazing character and really cares about clary, his family and his friends. I loved simon in this book, he really grown up for being the whining, teenager, he is learning to trust jace, but he also really tryed to protect clary in this book and others. I hated the Inquistor. i loved the others characters. i felt they really made the book

B00846REIS|2.0|This book is such a blatant rip off of Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James, that it's hard to know where to begin. \\"Author\\" Sylvia Day has basically taken Fifty Shades, changed some of the names (barely), tried to follow the same plot (unsuccessfully), and called it her own. If you are reading this thinking it's going to be as compelling and engrossing as Fifty Shades of Grey, you're going to be extremely disappointed. This book is just straightforward generic erotica and there's no real substance to it. I didn't care about these people, why are they suddenly together? Pretty blonde attracted to rich handsome mogel and they spend most of the book boinking away. That is all.

0307951529|5.0|I bought this ittle book, The $100.00 Start Up because I have actuall set up a little Art Studio and even though I have read books and have actually started my studio. I still feel there are things I could still learn and actually need to learn about running a working art studio!!! There really is not a whole lot out there about running an art studio.  So when I saw the title of the book The $100.00 Start UP.that caught my eye right away! I started my art studio on basically nothing and a credit card, which by the way, I no longer use!!! Credit cards are evil, but that at another time. I am part way thru this book and I have to say GO OUT AND GET THIS LITTLE BOOK!!!! You can't go wrong!!! It has good advice and tells you to get off your butt and start your dream, whatever it may be !!! That's the best part of this book, telling the reader to just get off your butt and get started!!! Stop whining, stop talking yourself out of whatever it is you want to do, JUST GO DO IT!!!  Even if it is on a small basis, go do it, at least try!!!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|One of my favorite games! This app is perfect. I've never had any problems with it. Simple and easy to use.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|When I first saw the ratings I was suspicous about all of the 5 star ratings, since it's very unusual to see any reviews that don't have some lower ratings counterbalancing the high ones. However, I tried the sample and by the time I came to the sample's end I immediately purchased the (Kindle) book. It's the kind of story that quickly pulls you in so you can't wait to see what happens next. I found the main characters interesting and people I could care about.  I liked the fact that the story was told from one perspective, that of the main character, instead of jumping around to different pov as is so common in current stories.  Also, like in real life, so often things are not exactly what the main character thinks they are.<br /><br />The first volume \\"Raven's Shadow\\" of the series for the most part relives the main character's life as a child and into adulthood and the forces that shape him into the man he is.  He is a warrior, a soldier, raised from early childhood to fight and follow orders.  But he is also a moral man and a decent man who must live with the lives he has taken, and struggle to hold fast his morals when he is being asked to commit actions that are directly opposed to his beliefs.<br /><br />The one disatisfaction I had was after a grand build up to a duel at the end of the story, it ends almost the minute it begins, and so was very anticlimatic.  Almost as though at this point the author had accomplished what he meant to in the story and just ended it. While the book ends in a manner to invite the next story it doesn't end on a cliffhanger so it's pretty satisfying if the second book doesn't come out for a while.<br /><br />There are a few misspelled words that sometimes are a little detracting from the smooth flow of the story, but overall the story is involving enough that the word mistakes are quickly passed by.<br /><br />For the low price of the book you're not risking much to give the book a try.  I think you'll be happy you did.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|As others have said, I'd gladly pay much more for this author's works. This is truly one of the best Fantasy novels I have read in a long time. It's a highly polished work, especially for the price, the characters are well developed, the pace is great, and the action and novel are fabulous.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this book, you won't regret it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Let me start by saying, I am extremely liberal. Whatever floats your boat sexually is fine. I believe we as women should celebrate our sexuality however we want to.<br /><br />However, there was nothing celebratory about the sex in Fifty Shades of Grey. The outright abuse in this trilogy is disturbing, especially considering how well it is selling.<br /><br />Christian Grey is everything I never want for my daughter. Yet, he is all the things women are taught to look for, even at the expense of maintaining a dysfunctional relationship. Wealthy and good-looking seem to overpower sadistic, controlling and abusive.<br /><br /> Before you plop down $30 for the trilogy, let me give you some quotes so you can decide for yourself if this is really something you want to absorb into your being. Amazon wouldn't even allow me to post most of the direct quotes I had because they are explicit, so I will stick to a few of the behavioral issues.<br /><br /> \\"This is not a man I want to cross...ever.\\" (139)<br /><br /> \\"The Dominant reserves the right to dismiss the Submissive from his service at any time and for any reason. The Submissive may request hr release at any time, such request to be granted at the discretion of the Dominant...\\" (167)<br /><br /> \\"Is he worthy of me? That's an interesting concept. I always wonder whether I am worthy of him.\\" (279)<br /><br />\\"I like the control it gives me, Anastasia. I want you to behave in a particular way, and if you don't, I shall punish you, and you will learn to behave the way I desire. I enjoy punishing you...I need to control you.\\" (287)<br /><br /> \\"I don't want to lose him. In spite of all his demands, his need to control, his scary vices, I have never felt as alive as I do now. It's a thrill to be sitting here beside him. He's so unpredictable, sexy, smart, and funny. But his moods...oh--and he wants to hurt me.\\" (355)<br /><br /> \\"This is so...I want to think wrong, but somehow it's not. It's right for Christian. It's what he wants--and after the last few days...after all he's done, I have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants, whatever he thinks he needs.\\" (484)<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey ends with the word grief. These \\"sexy\\" stories may be tantalizing, but they don't fit anywhere into a healthy sexuality.<br /><br />Don't support abuse. Don't propagate the victimization of young women with your money. Send your $30 to a women's shelter. If Fifty Shades continues sell well, they will soon need the money desperately.wants--and after the last few days...after all he's done, I have to man up and take whatever he decides he wants, whatever he thinks he needs.\\" (484)<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey ends with the word grief.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I am one of the many who read this story when it was on Twilighted.net and FanFiction.net so while being a little redundant, as very little was changed, I still enjoyed reading this again. Those of you who are enjoying it now, imagine having to wait week after week for new chapters! OMG what drama!<br /><br />I think it's great that Ms. James is having so much success. I would suggest, anyone bothering to read this review, to check out other fanfiction stories. Everybody is inspired by a good story with compelling characters. There are many talented writers out there that share - for free! - their expressions and imaginations.<br /><br />Great, sexy, fun read. I recommend this to anyone wanting a good escape from \\"vanilla\\" and \\"everyday\\" sex. It is about a bit more than that though. Read all if you read one.

B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Anytime I'm in another app and want to email something to my Evernote account, it just force closes with a message that the app stopped working!!! Look, the app was not \\"all that\\" anyway!!! Poor text editing included!! Just try to create a document, using bold, italic, numbered lists, bulleted lists, and checkboxes. After you do it, try to use the highlight feature that works on all other apps, and you see it does not work!!! You see the blue circle but it only highlights a text paragraph but not the bulleted or checklists!!! It just like stops like the indented stuff is some kind of picture it ignores and will not highlight it!!!<br /><br />The permissions are over the top too! Now I can not trust it to save my notes with so many instances of them disappearing!!! And they want 50 bucks a year for what, more of the same?? You can not even export the data from Evernote so you are stuck for life paying for the service if you can not import it off in a heartbeat!!  Total overrated ripoff!!!!<br /><br />I will try that Springboard app others recommended and see if it is any better. Colornote is okay but I had instances of trying to export a text list from another app to Colornote and it truncated the list, like it would only accept a certain length, but it was only a list of something that was 300 words!!! Then I tried again and it copied the list. I do not want to have to check this stuff all the time to see if it has a limited or copied correctly every time I want to save or email something.<br /><br />No matter which note app I try next, this Evernote has GOT TO GO!!!!!!!!

B00005JN0T|4.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"I, Robot\\" staring Will Smith. It was an interesting DVD. The movie was a futuristic tale, but only going ahead to the year 2035 so a lot of Chicago (the movie site) and it's people looked very much like today. A really big difference was the appearance and abundance of human-like robots who performed many, if not most, of the ordinary tasks of day to day life. This was a clever part of the movie, and the robots were very well done. These things looked like humans, talked like humans and moved like humans, but they were clearly not humans dressed up in costumes (as in Star Trek, let's say) for the purpose of the movie. What were they? Well, I don't know, but they were fascinating and they were present in great abundance. It's probably some clever computer animation trick, but the trick is very well done and a lot of credit is due.<br /><br />The story itself was not as fresh and new. It introduced the idea of life with robots where Will Smith was a human police detective and was one of the few who had a negative view of robots and their place in human culture. It seems that the robots were programed not to harm humans in any way nor could they be controlled to harm humans. Well, you know this isn't going to last or you wouldn't have much of a movie. Sure enough, a programming change was brought about and the robots began behaving more like humans in the negative sense. Thus began a long drawn out battle between Smith and his human colleagues opposing the human-like robots and their controllers. It involved a lot of action and destruction of anything and everything. The high action level will probably keep you watching carefully. All in all, I found the story to not have a particularly interesting plot and I'd rate it as a three-star movie in that sense. However, the sets and animations and high action are so well done, that I'd give it five stars for that part of the production. Okay, we'll average it out to a four star rating. My hope would be that the clever people who put this thing together will be back with a better plot.<br /><br />Gary Petersonhope would be that the clever people who put this thing together will be back with a better plot.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B004JN1D2I|4.0|The first three books were gripping, fascinating and very entertaining. The fourth book, however, was rather disappointing as the author filled it with lots of padding about historical context through contrived conversations between various characters. He also abandoned the characters who were the very essence of the first three books and substituted them with some real yawns.<br /><br />It almost felt like the author had run out of ideas or lost his investment in the original plot lines. I'm hoping book five picks up the pieces from the end of book three, as there is a wealth of material to play with. The first three books earn an unreserved five stars but I would be struggling to give the fourth book three stars.
B0086700CM|4.0|Ok don't get me wrong this game is amazing and super addicting and fun. But on the Kindle Fire, It freezes as u go on, and if u try to jump or duck, sometimes it wont let u and u die. Plz fix this!!! Overall, though, its great :)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had read the first book and was hooked once I got into the storyline. Yes, it is erotica! Who doesn't need a little erotica once in a while in their lives. So when I finished book one, I immediately purchased this one and was not disappointed. Please read the trilogy, because I feel Christian's and Ana's story really does end up to be a love story.
0553386794|5.0|So I've seen the tv show, both seasons, and I was curious about reading it. I thought that maybe the book wouldn't be as good compared to the tv show, or the fact that I know what would be coming would ruin it.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Every nuance is great, and being able to see where the foreshadowing is going is great as well. There are often parts of the show that you'll have missed, or entire parts described in the book that the show completely overlooked or changed.<br /><br />If you really want to immerse yourself in this world, read the book. Read all the books. You won't regret it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this series was my favorite i especially liked this one i recommend reading this seriesthe bad thing about the first book is that it keeps talking about training and living while i wait for the hunger games to happen.
020161622X|5.0|I've read this book after a few years of experience as a programmer. It is well written and succeeds in giving useful insights and tips for building good software and improving one skills and performance as a programmer.<br />I think it is a must-read for people who want to become professional programmers, no matter what language/discipline they end up using.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|One of the best self-published books I've ever bought. Nicely done coming of age fantasy work with well thought through, believable  magic and likable realistic characters. Yes, there are some minor gaps in the story line, some mundane details are not perfected, and the protagonist is a little bit too much of a knight in a shining armor, but the whole book is a solid, enjoyable read. I'm really looking forward to the sequel.
1936608898|5.0|I loved the book and recommend it to all our athletes because it's all about ACTION.  Yes, it's important to know why you should eat good food, but implementing clean food choices into everyday lifestyles can be a huge obstacle for lots of people.  Dallas and Melissa take their years of implementing clean eating habits across all types of people and packed the book full of practical advice.<br /><br />Not only do they deal with the day to day challenges of eating clean, but also the psychological aspects of breaking our dependance on food. This gives you the freedom to use food as it is meant to be used - as FUEL.<br /><br />You are only as good as your last meal.  You can pick up this book and start feeling better right away.<br /><br />Thank you guys for writing this.  It's a game changer.
0439023491|5.0|While there are plenty of good sequels out there, the majority of them don't seem to live up to the original.  \\"Catching Fire\\", on the other hand,definetly lived up to \\"The Hunger Games.\\"  This was a brilliant follow-up to the original.  \\"Catching Fire\\" does a great job expanding on the world of the series.  While \\"The Hunger Games\\" only introduced the reader to District 12, the Capital, and the arena where the games were held, but \\"Catching Fire\\" has the characters visting other districts.  The characters from the original book are kept in-character, and the new characters are very well-written.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" was really good, and I think fans of the original book will like it just as much.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This review from a die-hard Rush fan since '75: Clockwork Angels is possibly the best album they've ever made! Musically, the band moves forward by looking back. A concept album with a very strong set of songs and incredible instrumentation, especially Alex Lifeson's guitar work. If this album doesn't sell a zillion copies, earn them a Grammy for \\"The Garden\\" and put them in the RnRHoF, there is something very wrong with the system. Groups around almost 40 years rarely come up with new songs this great!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyd the second book in the series. Quick read and takes the reader into another time which for me makes it enjoyable. No deep thought reqired to reolax with thbis book.

B003O86FMW|3.0|It's a good book.  Worth reading and an easy read, but not the best book ever.  I would recommend reading the series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I only read this book because of all the hype about it.  I had some idea of what it was about but wanted to check it out for myself.  I was not disappointed.  In spite of some really steamy scenes I enjoyed the book and found myself looking forward to the second book in the series.  I don't want to give anything away so I'll just say that at the heart of it, this is still very much a book about romance (though it does go the long way around to get to it).  You won't be disappointed if you read it.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|A very strong album from Sara - good song writing, perfomances, lyrics. This type of music is a bit out of my normal genre (I listen to mostly 50's and 60's Jazz and heavier guitar rock)but I was intrigued after hearing a few songs. I then found out that Sara actually writes and performs the music; not just a \\"created\\" artist that is put in front of someone else's music as an \\"entertainer\\". Sara is a real artist, and the quality of the music is excellent. I highly recommend this album!

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|Prometheus, a quasi-prequel to Alien, looks pretty, but makes no sense whatsoever.  Hazarding a guess, I would imagine it began with a stupid script, and then Ridley Scott hired LOST alumnus Damon Lindelof to shroud everything in mystery so you could not tell how stupid it all was.  If you choose to have faith that, in the end, it will somehow all hold together, then you will be invited to buy the DVD or BluRay in the hopes that 20-30 minutes of extended footage will throw some small light on a thousand unanswered questions.  If you are still in the dark (as you surely will be), then you will be invited to further deepen your confusion by viewing the next episode of this unfinished story, due to be released a year or two from now.<br /><br />The setup:  Peter Weyland (aged billionaire) buys into Von-Daniken-style theories that life on Earth was created and nurtured by alien \\"gods\\", so he sends the starship PROMETHEUS to find them.  The crew of 17 includes Janek (captain), Chance and Ravel (pilots), Shaw (idiot archaeologist partially to blame for Weyland's dumb theories), Holloway (Shaw's idiot boyfriend), Vickers (inscrutable ice princess), Millburn (idiot biologist), Fifield (idiot geologist), Ford (woman with Scottish accent) and about 8 nameless, faceless nobodies.  Also on board is \\"David\\" (inscrutable android).<br /><br />After 2 years in hypersleep and a 35+ light-year journey in the general direction indicated by ancient cave art, these assorted idiots arrive in a distant star system, choose a convenient moon of a convenient gas giant, and, after flying over the surface for a minute or two, land in an almost-random location after noticing some straight lines in the earth.  By luck, it turns out they have landed right next a giant alien pyramid.  They start exploring, and, as you would expect in an Alien prequel, soon start dying horribly.  Despite some assorted mayhem, this film does not work as horror, mainly because the viewer does not give a rat's whisker about any of the people getting killed.  Most victims are completely unlikeable and/or seem to lack any instincts for self-preservation.  If they don't care whether they live or die, then why should we?  Meanwhile, suspension of disbelief is constantly being shattered by the general idiocy of the script.<br /><br />Don't expect to know what is going on.  While the visuals, events and atmosphere are vaguely similar to the sort you would expect from an Alien movie, the creatures we encounter are not the same, and their precise connection to the creatures we know will remain obscure - adding to the dozens of unanswered questions you will be left with at the film's end.  The failure to tie in directly with ALIEN would be fine if it managed to tell its own story, but it doesn't.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the film-makers try to impress you by asking \\"big questions\\" about God, creation, what is the essential difference, if any, between a robot and a human being, whether creating \\"life\\" makes you a \\"god\\", etc., etc.  If you have any sense, you will notice that it takes no intelligence to merely ASK such questions, and that the film fails to offer any answers or even meaningful insights concerning them.about any of the people getting killed.

B0088RQ4X4|4.0|As usual, the group-think of professional critics (an endangered species, given their lack of value at newspapers) was wrong about this one.  I'm sorry I missed it at the theater, but thoroughly enjoyed the BluRay version.  About the only thing annoying about the movie was the princess's unnaturally blue eyes - rather like the Fremen in Dune.  I'm a big fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and thought it was ironic that a few critics complained that this movie was a ripoff of Avatar.  I suspect many critics only read their own reviews.<br /><br />It's a shame that Disney took a financial dunking - which means we won't see a sequel.  Fortunately we still have the books.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I definitely recommend the movie for any fantasy/sci-fi fans.

055338466X|5.0|This book is great and I applaud Hawking for his strength to speak his mind and not let religion zealots control his freedom of speech. Hawking simply proves what science has been able to prove from the beginning. That a god does not exist. A god that cannot even show himself is no god at all. This is self explanatory. It is human nature to fear death and those that cannot handle that thought flock together to believe there is a life after death. And no matter what the evidence, you can never prove them wrong because they just won't hear it. You cannot change these people, you can only change yourself to follow science for the answers - not religion.
B004RKXNDU|2.0|I had hoped for a more interesting and entertaining offering, but except for the relationship between Jim and the  boy, didn't much care for any of the other characters.  Lots of innuendo and unintersting exchanges between just too many charactersl. Hard to keep track of who was doing what to whom. But I did figure out who the bad guy was halfway throuogh.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I read many of the reviews on Amazon before buying the Wool Omnibus. I'm always wary of reviews that say \\"destined to be a classic,\\" or some such hyperbole. Such determinations can only be made after some real time has passed. That said, the Wool series is a really good sci-fi story. It starts off with the original \\"Wool\\" short story, which in some ways reads like a mystery with some sci-fi elements. Howey crafts a compelling, surprising story. The second installment delves into character more while advancing the overall plot. Wool 3-5 gets to the meat of the story. It's a well-written, well-concieved sci-fi story.<br /><br />Without getting into heavy spoiler territory, the underlying technological basis of this story (explored and explained in more detail in \\"First Shift: Legacy\\") was dealt with in Michael Crichton's \\"Prey.\\" That was a compelling read, but the Wool series handles the material with much greater depth. Howey crafts much deeper characters and deals with the issues (moral and practical) on a much grander scale. I hesitate to even mention Michael Crichton, because I wouldn't want my readers to think Wool is a cheap airport thriller. It isn't. It is just as compelling as those thrillers (their strong suit) but is deeper, written better and ultimately more interesting. I look forward to more installments and more of Howey's work.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Really enjoyed the self retrospective.  Always doing that in my day to day...  I found Streep's performance outstanding what we've come to expect of her.  Jim Broadbent was also exceptional.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|The game was fun and long enough to get you money's worth at $1.49.  However, the major drawback is that you cannot pinch and zoom on this game so you need good vision.  The other thing I wasn't crazy about is that rather than searching for a list of named items, they were always outline of the items you were seeking.  There were some nice &quot;find the difference&quot; and other puzzles to break up the object searches, however.  Overall, a pretty good buy.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is my favorite game. After you play for awhile some of the words get repeated but it's a light fun way to play a game at your leisure with people you know.
B007SGM084|5.0|I am still reading the books but so far I do love them. I had heard quite a few people on T.V. talking about them and they sounded very intriguing. The author certainly seems to \\"know\\" her material, almost as if some of it is based on personal experiences. I have read other erotic books and even books on the subject of submissives and domminants but what I am enjoying about these books is that it is also a love story and there is a good storyline behind it as well. I can certainly understand why so many people are talking about this trilogy.
B000FZETKC|5.0|It's an awesome movie, I had to get it. They rarely make movies like this anymore. I love those 80's movies
B007O3QC8K|4.0|I looked on the Amazon reviews for this new Bruckner/Rattle offering in hopes that someone might help me clarify what I felt upon my first listen.  Not being a trained musician, I don't always have a ready vocabulary to articulate what I feel.  However, I found quite a lot of unstinting praise and that didn't do it for me.  Perhaps I can be forgiven for posting a review from elsewhere, for it just about sums up perfectly what I felt.<br /><br />\\"There are many myths concerning Bruckner's finales, not the least of which is that they are somehow \\"problematic\\". Not true. After the Fourth Symphony, each is perfectly appropriate in its own way to the work in question, and the lesson we learn from the Eighth Symphony is that any issues concerning the length and structure of the finale are no less applicable to the work's other movements as well. The finale of the Ninth in this version lasts 653 bars, of which 96 are completely conjectural, having been filled in by the editorial team of Samale, Phillips, Cohrs, and Mazzuca. Bruckner left 440 bars in score, and 117 bars in sketch. This is a lot of authentic Bruckner, but the numbers remain deceptive.<br /><br />\\"The fact is that anyone can write fake Bruckner. When a composer has a distinctive sound, as Bruckner certainly does, pastiche composing is a simple thing. It is the strokes of genius, the leaps into the unknown, those moments where the idiom moves into new terrain, that can't be anticipated or copied. It therefore follows that the problems with this finale are just as likely to arise out of original material that Bruckner wrote down but was not able to bang into final shape because he had not yet grasped its full implications, as from those less important bits of his usual stuff that he never committed to paper at all.<br /><br />\\"There are moments that sound unquestionably idiomatic: you can hear one from about 14 minutes in if you sample the sound clip below. Others, equally \\"idiomatic\\" technically speaking, aresimply unconvincing, such as the return of the opening movement's unison theme at the very end. This is a cheap tactic, and while Bruckner does it all the time, and may well have thought about doing it again, making this tune the \\"bad guy\\" whose rather too easy defeat precedes the final victorious apotheosis comes off as a mere cliché. Then there is the terribly fragmented, stop-and-start character of the second subject material after the (inevitable) unison theme near the movement's opening. Again, this may be all Bruckner, but it comes very close to self-parody, and it may be one of those things that he would have adjusted on reflection. Or maybe not. We can't know.<br /><br />\\"What about the performance? I purchased (please note) this disc full of trepidation, because although there's no question that the Berlin Philharmonic remains one of the world's great orchestras, Simon Rattle has so consistently failed to live up to his much vaunted reputation that it was difficult to work up much enthusiasm for this release. However, while not perfect, it's good to be able to report that both Rattle and the ensemble do some excellent work, certainly some of their best so far. The basic sonority actually comes close to what Karajan used to offer: a spectacularly rich cushion of strings that promises much and delivers in full in the Adagio, but that tends to obscure some rhythmic detail in the tuttis. Thus, the dotted-rhythm brass exchanges in the horns and trombones in the first movement's coda become undifferentiated blobs of harmony, and the loud outbursts in the scherzo lack timbral differentiation. At lower volume levels, though, the playing is gorgeous in all departments.<br /><br />\\"As for Rattle's approach, he deserves credit for having conceived the interpretation so as to project the work as a genuine, four-movement symphony. The tendency over the years has been to balance the piece with the adagio in mind as the finale, which means a long, slow first movement asa counterbalance. Rattle takes the opening movement and finale at similar speeds. Both last about 23 minutes, the Adagio a bit longer, making it the natural focal point of the work. The result makes perfect sense structurally, and the result is very intelligent and wholly convincing. Whether or not you find the finale completely satisfying, Rattle's view of how it fits into the symphony's larger scheme is surely the right one. Ultimately, then, this is a release that no Bruckner fan can afford to miss, and we should take a moment to give due credit to the team of Samale, Phillips, Cohrs, and Mazzuca for their sensitive work on Bruckner's score, as well as to Rattle and Berlin for displaying the results in such a positive light.\\"<br /><br />-- David Hurwitz, ClassicsToday.com

0345803485|1.0|If you want to read a trashy novel, I would recommend reading anything by Danielle Steele (gee...wonder if this is where Anastasia's name comes from). At least Danielle tells a good story, with proper character development and interesting plot line. 50 Shades has none of theses qualities. It is perhaps the worst book I have ever read! The story is completely contrived and it is not as hot as everyone says it is. It is Boring! I only read this book because of all the hype and frankly, it insulted my intelligence. There are so many things wrong with this book, I can't possibly list them all. Spend your money on something more worthwhile.

0765316978|5.0|This is essentially the same story as told in `The Last Colony' but from a different point of view. So why would I give it five stars? Simply because it is done so well. It caught my interest, made me smile, jerked my emotions, and reintroduced me to people and places that I became well acquainted with in Scalzi's other `An Old Man's War' books.<br />Technically, this should probably be considered a Young Adult novel because of the teenage protagonist. There is nothing wrong with this. Other authors (myself included) have written YA spinoffs set in the same world and with overlapping characters from their adult novels. This, however, is not a spinoff. This is the same story related in `The Last Colony' but from the perspective of John's and Jane's adopted daughter, Zoe. She was a great minor character in previous books and an exceptional protagonist in this one, which is told in first person, giving us insights into how she deals with being an orphan, the adopted daughter of the colony leaders of the planet Roanoke, and something like a goddess to the alien species known as the Obin.<br />The aspect of the book that feels a bit unnatural is some of the dialogue between Zoe and her friends. They are almost too witty, and Zoe and her friend Gretchen have more self-confidence than seems likely for two teenage girls. Of course, they are not normal teenagers. After all, who wants to read about hormonally powered, angst driven, girls whose major concern is how to attract a boyfriend? ... Oh, right. Those. Do yourself a favor and read this instead. Zoe has angst, she has hormones, she even has a boyfriend, but she also has intelligence, common sense, and wisdom beyond her years.<br />Scalzi has become one of my favorite authors, and I would love to see more stories set in this universe he has created. How does Roanoke fare? How does the Colonial Union deal with the Conclave? Do they join them? Do they oppose them? Is the C.U. overthrown? And what about Earth? It's an interesting world and there are many more story possibilities here. If he does continue with this thread, though, it will leave him with less time for his other writing, which would be a shame. Perhaps he could be cloned...esting world and there are many more story possibilities here.

1936608898|5.0|The Hartwigs have outdone themselves with \\"Its Starts With Food.\\" The book offers the macro and micro-veiw of nutrition for both those that are into and not into the \\"science-y\\" stuff.  Dallas and Melissa offer a four category standard for classifying food as either \\"good\\" or \\"bad.\\" A food is \\"good\\" if it promotes positive psychological, hormonal. gut, and anti-inflammatory responses. There are really no surprises on what types of foods fail this test. Grains, legumes, and sugar are out. The strength of this book is equipping your with the \\"why\\" and \\"how\\" simultaneously. My favorite section is the \\"hormone\\" section because it explains how powerful these \\"signals\\" are in regulating metabolic functions. The book is easy to read and will keep you going until the end. Its a great starting place for those interested in a paleo/low carb lifestyle, but also a great resource for those who want to know more.

I would highly recommend!!

1936608898|5.0|So this past weekend I finally got down to digging into this gem and WOW! It is probably the most well-written and relevant book on Paleo Nutrition and Health since Robb Wolf's The Paleo Solution. I hate to actually use the term Paleo when reviewing this book because one of the big messages that Dallas and Melissa try to make is that it's not about \\"Paleo\\". It's about food choices and lifestyle choices, period. It's about what makes you a healthier, more vibrant human being and what doesn't. Like the title says, it all starts with the food you put on your plates and in your body.<br /><br />So I'm kind of a closet nerd...ok maybe I'm just a nerd. Who am I kidding? People know me. :) Anyway, I was really psyched and impressed with how much science Dallas and Melissa were able to cram into this book without making me feel like I'd just sat though a mind-numbing freshman biology class. The science was easy to understand and made so much sense. Now I know that having a background in Nursing and working as a Paleo Nutritionist gives me a little leg up with regards to the \\"science-y\\" stuff but I promise, anyone can understand and apply the principals put forth in It Starts With Food. And there are definitely some analogies that I will be applying in my own practice. I absolutely love the break down of the four Good Food Standards and the explanation as why certain food groups do or don't fit into the Good Food Standards.<br /><br />As far as real-life food management, It Starts With Food scored a home run. Their Mealsimple Template and comprehensive chapters on proteins, veggies, and carbs make it easy to create healthy, well-rounded meals. No weighing or measuring necessary because, let's be honest, we're not going to carry around food scales everywhere we go AND we don't have to! And of course this book wouldn't be complete without an extensive introduction to the Whole 30. I have completed 3 Whole 30's myself and I think the first one would have been a lot easier had Ihad It Starts With Food at my disposal.<br /><br />Overall, It Starts With Food is a must to add to your ever-growing nutrition/health/paleo library.

B004FEFS5E|4.0|This book will help the semi-skilled photographer learn to use aperture, shutter speed, ISO, flash and other easy to remember methods to improve their photographs using artistically creative exposures and not just technically correct exposures.<br />I would consider myself a middling, technically competent photographer. Much of the book refreshed my technical understanding of exposure. However, there have been a lot of changes in photographic technology, and this book discusses many of the features available on the current crop of digital cameras and explained how to use that technology to get the information needed to use the manual functions to move beyond point-and-shoot-trial-and-error photography to become a better photographic artist.<br />I recommend the book for anyone who wants to discover the satisfaction of graduating from the security blanket of automatic controls to enjoy a creative photographic experience.<br />Get the book. Read the book. Learn the techniques. Take creative pictures.

B001EBWITA|4.0|Despite the poor critic reviews, I found that I still enjoyed this movie. Keanu Reeves fit the role of Constantine nicely, but I will admit to a bit of bias in liking most every movie he has starred in. Tilda Swinton played a great angel, Gabriel - at least within the confines of Gabriel's plotted role which I believed to be a bit farcical. That was my only real complaint about the movie plot - that it was premised upon Gabriel betraying God and allying with Lucifer's son to bring hell to Earth. But then to be fair, The Prophecy trilogy are among my favorite movies and they are premised upon Gabriel leading a rebellion against Heaven and attempting to wipe out humanity.<br /><br />The story kept a quick pace, perhaps too quick at points in that they didn't really explain much of Constantine's history nor really give much of anything to add any real depth to his character. They seemed to make everything shallow and thus simple. That he is an uncaring prick that is self destructive with booze and cigarettes. It is also asserted by Gabriel that he is trying to \\"buy\\" his way into heaven by banishing demons to hell to atone because he committed suicide (though was resuscitated) as a teen, an act deemed a mortal sin destining him for eternal damnation. He was shown briefly as a boy being tormented by the sights of demons and parents who put him through hell by putting him in institutions and allowing electric shock therapy while he was fully awake and without pain relief prior to his suicide and resuscitation. That is all we are shown about his character. There is nothing about his allies, who they were and how he met/came to work with them. They were simply throw aways rather than being used to tell us more about Constantine and his history.<br /><br />I can only assume that they did this because there was an expectation/assumption that the audience be familiar with the comic series. There was certainly little here to really familiarize the character of Constantine to the audience and thus it didn't really create much emotional attachment to his character by the audience. This perhaps more than anything is what damned this movie to poor reviews and poor box office showing.<br /><br />In any case, despite its poor showing in box office revenues, I do hope to see a sequel some day and preferably with Keanu Reeves as Constantine again. Hopefully though with a better defined character that can connect with the audience.e audience and thus it didn't really create much emotional attachment to his character by the audience.

B002V9PEUE|5.0|Forget about discussion of the plot and acting abilities.  You folk already know the story line, so let's discuss the most important part of buying a blu ray disc....the quality of the video and audio transfer.  Wish more people would review these aspects than telling me the story lines and their interpretations of such.<br /><br />Many times older movies receive poor transfers to blu ray and often the excuse it is that \\"They are older movies\\"  Cliffhanger on Blu ray proves that that excuse is bunk.<br />The transfer of the video on blu ray is exceptionally good.  The colors pop and are vivid with no grain, noise or any other video distraction.  It shows to me that some real effort went into transferring the original master to blu ray markedly improving it over the Standard DVD release which I also have.<br />The DTS HD audio is also a welcome addition and this is one disc where re editing for discreet channels, front and rears, is nicely used through out.  The sub is there when needed and if you have a hi end theater system, the Blu ray version makes it well worth your while.<br /><br />The extras contain the regular documentary discussions and a couple of deleted scenes with excellent explanations by the director why they were not used.<br /><br />If you are going to upgrade from a standard DVD or are just thinking about buying this on  Blu Ray, this disc will not disappoint.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

B0044XUZ9K|5.0|I watched the SyFy channel's miniseries of Treasure Island, and it had some things that I didn't remember reading when I was a kid.  So I got the upgraded Kindle version from Amazon with pictures and a working table of contents.  What great fun to read again!  How nice to be able highlight a word like \\"deadlights\\" and have the dictionary give me a definition, which I then tried to fit into pirate slang. The map of the island helped to understand the movements of the various parties.  It turns out SyFy HAD changed things to include left-wing life lessons into what had been a rollicking fun adventure.  I like the original much better.  No throwing the treasure overboard to avoid its corrupting influence for me!

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I fell in love at first site with this case. The negative reviews however, scared me into almost not getting it. I am so glad I ordered it though! It is a gorgeous case and fits my kindle fire like a glove. I don't know why so many said it didn't fit, if anything it accentuates the fire perfectly, and looks good doing it. I can put it in and take it out with ease, but it is also nice and snug, ensuring the safety of my kindle. The straps do partially cover the very corner of the speakers, but you cannot tell the difference whatsoever. A brilliant case in an amazing design, it is a must have.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|I got this cd and immediately downloaded to my iPod to preserve the disc. The album works on so many levels it is astounding. To just listen to the songs one is struck by the musicianship that is obvious on this masterpiece. Neil has been pounding those drums live for years but this is the first time I truly can feel like they have somehow captured his playing on a studio disc. If you compare any of the other discs to his live renditions of the same songs you can tell that he adds so much more energy live and he has always said that capturing the real drums sound on disc has been difficult. I feel that this is not the case this time. Peart's drum work throughout is nothing less of astonishing. The man does not let up at all. Geddy's voice has never sounded so rich and warm and inviting as he does on this disc. He is truly telling a story and the tonal colors he paints with are gorgeous and lilting. I can feel his anger in the Anarchist, his bewilderment in Carnies and his despair in Halo Effect. Alex Lifeson has reinvented for me what a guitar master can be, it is not just shredding which Alex has proven time and time again, it is using your guitar like a one man orchestra. Lifeson gives me so much to chew on with this disc that it is difficult to swallow on even just one listen. I pre ordered this from over the pond through classic rock magazine and I have been listening to nothing but this disc since Saturday and I believe this is one of those cd's that will still be revealing its secrets two or three years from now, yes, there is that much music. Now that is just one facet of this recording the recording itself is pristine and crisp. How I wish Nick would re produce Vapor Trails for us! Another facet and not one to be overlooked or outdone is the story of this cd. It literally took me two hours to sit down with the disc and read the lyrics and the short snippets Neil gives us of the complete story which will soon be revealed when the novel comes out by Kevin Anderson. The story is at times wonderful, scary, glorious and sad. Hmm...just like life! Thank you Rush for the greatest cd of your career and I for one cannot wait to see what you do with this in the live show. I vote for an evening with Rush with Clockwork Angels in its entirety followed by Signals anniversary in its entirety and end the night with 2112. If I never hear Tom Sawyer or Closer to the Heart live in concert again it is okay with me. I met you guys in Syracuse on the Time Machine tour with my wife and my brother (RIP) and it is a night that will stay with me and closer to my heart now that my brother is gone. I love you guys for doing that for your fans.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Prometheus is an amazing SciFi epic with the best visuals I've seen in film to date. Simply put, Ridley Scott shot a breathtakingly beautiful film; the Real3D is amazing and isn't poorly done like in some converted films. Every frame in this film is beautiful and, although limited, the computer-generated images are stunning. Also, the soundtrack matches the film, at least in my opinion. I thought it sounded epic as the crew made their discovery. The music from the trailers and the teasers isn't actually heard, or at least I don't remember hearing it.<br /><br />The acting was great from the whole cast; I didn't see any notable flaws in the acting. The actions of some characters were questionable though. Why would you move toward a snake-like species when you've seen so many unexplained dead bodies already? Aside from a couple of silly, or stupid, character choices, the actual story is amazing. The story is the search for the engineers that may have engineered us; the search for our creators. It builds a very creepy yet fascinating atmosphere filled with the mystery of life. There are many unanswered questions, but I think it was done purposely. It leaves the door open for the very-likely sequel. Regardless, I actually enjoyed the mystery.<br /><br />This is the best film I've seen all year and possibly last year as well. I don't recommend going into this film expecting a direct prequel to Alien, since it really isn't. It can really standalone. But there is a cool treat for Alien fans at the end that I actually enjoyed. I highly recommend it.

014241493X|5.0|This is my very first book by John Green. It was gifted to me from Carmen, a young (mid twenties) friend, on my Kindle. When I began reading it I wondered if I was just too old to understand teenagers (I am 67) but I persevered. I thought that if Carmen liked it enough to give it to me that it must be worth my reading time as she is very smart, well read and intellectually curious. Once I got \\"into\\" the book, I could not put it down. II especially loved the car adventure at the end of the book. The book reminded me that young folks can be just as committed, honorable and loyal as old folks and that they are good and kind too even if they like to act kooky once in a while. Now I look forward to reading more books by John Green. I also will recommend Paper Towns to my own book club. We frequently like to read books which are out of our normal genre (I know we were the very first in Miami to read the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series as two of our members brought some books home from England before they were published in the USA). We loved the series and I think our members will like \\"Q\\" and Margo too.

B00881VLCE|4.0|The Magic Puzzles app, by XIMAD INC, has been running on my Kindle Fire for several weeks now.  In that time, the members of  my family have all had their time with it, downloading several of the free galleries into it's memory. This has made available dozens of free photos to piece together in just a few pieces for small children to over 200 pieces for advanced players. You also have the option to shuffle AND rotate the tiles as well.<br /><br />I myself prefer to use the edge button to filter out all but the border tiles and finish the frame first, but you can choose your own preferences, including the option to download extra galleries available for a small payment if you exhaust the many free galleries.<br /><br />Puzzle fanatics will enjoy the stable platform as they work their way through the large collections of free and low cost galleries.
0439023513|1.0|The book is terrible and such a let down from the previous two.  And to be clear, it is not just the ending I hate, but almost all of the book.  In my opinion, the first two books were always leading to the strong and deadly heroine emerging as a leader, to someday become a leader of rebellion  who trys to save the broken world she lives in as best she can.  Whether she would win and at what cost seemed to be the only question.<br /><br />But what do we get in Mockingjay?  Katniss is instead a teary, adled, crying, crazy and over all depressed character throughout the story and worse  lead around as a puppet.  It opens with her in this depressed condition, which is annoying,  and worse she keeps falling back into that state due to schocking things that keep happening (at the end of chapters).  And guess what.  She becomes that person in the end.  The author also does the same to Peeta, who spends much of the book crazy and deranged. Not exactly what people are hoping to read on their two favorite characters.  Gale the anti authoritarian hunter?  Oh, he wants to become a soldier now and follow regime and protocols.  As the book progresses, most chapters end with a shock most often more contrived than the one before.  It got so bad that as I hit the page where I could see the end of the chapter was near I would think \\"what bad is going to happen now\\".  That is not good writing.<br /><br />All this leads to the end which is incredibly rushed and unsatisfying and the overall book really has no flow.  Extremely important characters die with hardly any fanfare or drama, including one which is utterly contrived in its nature: SPOILER:<br /><br />No way would a 13 year old Prim have been on the frontlines in the Capitol as a medic.  What utter sillyness.  The book focuses on killing more children near the end for in my opinion, cheap shock value.  Not sure if the author was hoping to score points on commenting on the misery of war or looking to score points for shock value,or if she was just in a hurry, but this was such a bad conclusion it basically ruined the series for me.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is the perfect title for this book. I've read some of the snarkier reviews and feel sorry for anyone that would actually read this book and look at it as a how to guide in relationships. The characters are completely crazy and over the top but I think it makes for an interesting, page turning, I have to read this again, kind of story. Abby and Travis are so passionate and dark in their own ways based on their past and how they were hurt. I think this book accurately depicts that people don't live through traumatic events and become well adjusted individuals who know how to make the right decisions or give in to their happiness. You will laugh and cringe, you will get mad at the characters and love them at the same time, sweat from the fights and the other steamy scenes, and then read it all over again! I really hope this is made into a movie it would be cool to see.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Yes I loved it that much I had to say it 3 times! This is Colleen Hoover's debut novel and she has left me practically speechless. I have never laughed or cried so hard reading a book in my entire life. I love any piece of art, whether a book, movie, poem, or song that can invoke so much emotion. I connected with all of the characters on such a deep level and that doesn't happen for me very often..and I read ALOT.<br /><br />I have read some reviews where people think that Will and Lake's feelings develop too quickly and it isn't believable, but I think that is a bs critique. It does happen that way for some people and I found it to be very real. The relationships in this book, whether between Lake and Kel, Lake and Eddie, Lake and her mother, or Will and Caulder is so very real. That is what makes me absolutely love this story.<br /><br />I have also never heard of Slam poetry before or the Avett Brothers...now I am a huge fan of both!!<br /><br />If you are looking for an book that will make you laugh, cry, and remember how it feels to fall in love, then this is the book for you.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Well I have mixed feelings about this read.  At first it appears to be nothing but explicit sex scenes borderline porn.  Then I decided that it really is a modern day love story.  I enjoyed the brief story line but the sex really did get boring. Book 1 does leave the reader hanging so Book II is a must read, but Book III is no big deal and not really necessary.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know I am in the minority, but I found the book boring and predictable.  Everything that was written could have been written in one book, not three, but once you read the first, you wanted to know the details so you you were forced to by all 3 and then, as the facts unfolded, they were anticlimactic to say the least. Plot was predicable, boy finds girl, girl pisses boy off, boy gets mad and then boy and girl make up.  Every other page consisted of  their sexual exploits which is why everyone is buying the book-and even they became boring after the first 30 pages.  I would never have started the book if I knew I would end up spending $30 for the same basic storyline repeated over and over again.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Let me just say that I had no expectations what so ever so I was shockingly happy with the album.<br />Rush has been my favorite band for over 20 years and hearing this album makes me happy to be involved in such a band and proud to be a fan.<br /><br />We all have heard Caravan, BU2B, Headlong flight. They gave us a glimpse of what is coming and here it came.<br /><br />Clockwork angels song starts off slowly then kicks off with a strong heavy riff and a great solo performance.<br />Anarchist is a song you'd never expect to hear in the 2012 year, it is strong and the drums and the bass guitar makes heavy combination after each Riff. My First favorite.<br /><br />I can tell you all about the album but truly you have to hear it for yourself. It's one of the best albums I have heard so far and every listen it grows even more.<br /><br />I want to add that \\"The Garden\\" is an inspiring song that was made to last and to be a Rush classic. Geddy's vocals remind me of days of Fly by Night's Rivendel.

B007MAETA8|4.0|My favorite track is the title song, \\"Born And Raised,\\" which features angelic harmonies by David Crosby and Graham Nash (of course!), and finds the tabloid-riddled artist applying balm to his \\"quarter life crisis\\" with a dose of thirty-something maturity. In revealing intimate details of his own life (i.e., his parents' recent divorce, his stupid mouth, his numerous cringe-inducing tweets, etc.) Mayer is giving voice to a generation of emerging adults navigating the coming-of-age process in the era of social media and public meltdowns. Andy Warhol's notorious 15 minutes of fame prediction brought to life. From this perspective, Mayer's album is nothing short of a public service. Teenagers, take notes!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|For the last few years, there have been a number of Marvel comics characters adapted to the big screen. Some of them have had their film rights taken up by other studios, so despite the fondest wishes of some comics fanboys, there will never be massive crossovers. Since 2008, however, there has been a concerted effort to create a shared cinematic universe among several characters. Two Iron Man films, The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America: The First Avenger have shared common links, characters, and references, which have all led to this summer's blockbuster event The Avengers. It's been awhile, but Marvel Studios chose the right directors for the earlier projects, and carefully brought all of these together under just the right director to bring the team to life for the first time on the big screen. And it's paid off beautifully.<br /><br />The film starts with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), director of SHIELD, an intelligence and special ops agency with a near unlimited budget, coming to a secure facility where trouble is brewing. Fury and his right hand agents, Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg, returning again to the films) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders, making her debut in the franchise) learn that the Tesseract, a cubed energy source last seen in The First Avenger, is behaving erratically. The scientist in charge, Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard, reprising his role from Thor) barely has time to brief Fury when the Tesseract opens a wormhole, and out comes the treacherous Loki (Tom Hiddleston, who was last seen falling into the void in Thor).<br /><br />Loki uses mind control on Selvig and SHIELD agent Clint Barton, aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner, who did a cameo as the character in last year's Thor), escaping from the facility with the Tesseract. Fury, whose plans to start a team of superhumans have stalled, must assemble the group. Captain America (Chris Evans) is only just starting to get used to life in the current day after being in stasis for decades. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is opening up a new Stark Tower in New York City and spending time with his assistant turned partner turned girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow, making a cameo this time out). The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) is called in from an interrogation overseas to bring in another potential team member. She tracks down Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo, taking over the role from Edward Norton and thus becoming the third Banner in three films- the Ang Lee film doesn't count as canon in this franchise by the way- and the most suitable for the role) in India. Banner, aside from being a genius who's the definitive expert in gamma radiation, also happens to turn into a rampaging green sledgehammer of sheer power called the Hulk when he gets mad.<br /><br />Loki's brother Thor (Chris Hemsworth) arrives from Asgard, clashing briefly with Iron Man and Captain America before joining in with the group. He also brings the news that Loki seeks to bring an alien army to Earth for a full invasion, to subjugate humanity once and for all. As Loki works to make that happen, the team must bridge the differences between them, get past their dysfunction, and work together to save the world.<br /><br />The movie succeeds on the basis of several elements. First, the dynamics between the characters is just right, fitting both the comic and cinematic versions of each team member. Their personalities and histories are conveyed well through the screenplay and the performances, both in the way they butt heads and work together. I liked the way Tony and Bruce- two intellectual geniuses- sparred with each other in the lab and bickered, for example, and Steve Rogers, as a man completely out of his own time, feels once again true to form. Each of these characters are strong, alpha personalities who have to find a way to work cohesively. At first, they're at odds (in fact, through the film, pretty much every member of the team gets into a fight with at least someone else on the team). After a pivotal moment, they become united in a common cause.<br /><br />The casting is essential as well. With the exception of Ruffalo, all of the leads have appeared in the earlier films, and have fit their characters very well. Evans, the soldier out of time, becomes the natural leader again, decisive and courageous despite the odds. Downey, playing Stark for the third time now, once again gets some of the great lines (not all of them!) with his funny, acerbic take on the character, pretty much irritating everyone else in the cast to some degree. Johansson, as the Widow, gives us a character whose backstory is fleshed out, who can use truth and subterfuge in the very same moment, and who-despite being a mere human- is credible as the most dangerous woman alive. Renner spends the first part of the movie as a bit of a ghost until he gets freed from Loki's control, but afterwards becomes the solid marksman, absolutely cool under pressure, with history with the Widow. I liked their interaction.<br /><br />Hemsworth's return as Thor is more than welcome; he was perfectly cast as the character in last year's film, and he seems as if he never stepped out of the role. I liked that there are moments in the film where he's the voice of reason, both with the Hulk and with his brother Loki. Hiddleston, as Loki, once again is a compelling villain, and making him the reason the Avengers come together is a good nod to the comics history as well. A broken and utterly desolate soul since his exile, it's not that much of a leap for such a man to end up becoming capable of terrible acts. Hiddleston conveys that quality very well indeed.<br /><br />Ruffalo, as the newcomer to the franchise, fits the role of Banner perfectly. The character has been played before by Eric Bana (too whiny in the Ang Lee film, but the blame for that debacle can be laid at the director's feet) and Edward Norton, who just seemed off in the role. Ruffalo gives us a brilliant, troubled man who's all too aware of the danger his other side presents- his revelation that he's tried to commit suicide is perfectly suited to who he is- and yet he's a very sympathetic character, both as himself and as the big green walking temper tantrum.<br /><br />The production values of the film help things along. Alan Silvestri, who scored The First Avenger, returns to compose the music for this film, and he gives us powerful, commanding music that perfectly suits the themes of the film. The CGI, makeup, set design, and costuming involved is very well done, and it really shows. The Avengers quinjet and the SHIELD helicarrier are rendered well, just as I'd imagine them to be. The invading army (largely cannon fodder, and never before used in the comics version) mostly use gliders as their invasion kicks off the final act of the film, and look decidedly ugly. Their flight scenes have a frantic, chaotic feel that looks real, and their leviathans- giant armoured flying creatures- look gigantic and terrifying, and very much in the scene, as opposed to completely fake. The battle between the Avengers and these invaders feels very much immediate and real, and that's a credit to the live action and how seamlessly it blends with the CGI elements.<br /><br />The CGI is probably best expressed in the look of the Hulk. In the Ang Lee film, the CGI for the character was inconsistent at best, and the Hulk often seemed over or undersized, not in the picture with other characters, and just generally muddled. That improved greatly in The Incredible Hulk, and is certainly well done here. The Hulk has consistency whenever he appears on the screen, and feels very much like he's sharing space with the rest of the cast. Much attention to detail has been paid to getting him right, and it paid off.<br /><br />It's director Joss Whedon who brings it all together, and he was the ideal choice for helming the project. Whedon knows the source material very well indeed, and his background suits the demands of the film. This is the creative force behind Firefly, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Angel, after all (one of his cast members from the latter two series in fact has a cameo in the film, though Alexis Denisof is completely unrecognizable from his days as an erstwhile British Watcher). Whedon gets group dynamics, how to mold together the complex relationships and personalities into a unified whole. He also has a good sense of humor, and that plays itself out well throughout the film. He gets the best out of his cast and crew, and in the end, the film is a grand slam out of the ballpark. As the proverbial coach of the team, Whedon can take a well deserved bow.<br /><br />In closing, the film succeeds wildly in bringing these characters together. The Marvel universe has always had much more interesting characters then their DC counterparts, after all (sorry, Superman, but you'll always be a boring Boy Scout). The film tells a story of coming together in a common cause, to fight back against impossible odds, to stand as one. There are some extraordinary jaw dropping moments throughout the film, but I think the best moments of the film are the ways that the characters interact with each other. Sometimes that's through dialogue. Other times it's just a look. Or the way a god of mischief winds up getting six heroes really, really mad at him.f the danger his other side presents- his revelation that he's tried to commit suicide is perfectly suited to who he is- and yet he's a very sympathetic character, both as himself and as the big green walking temper tantrum.<br /><br />The production values of the film help things along.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Another classic cartoon from the Disney studios with luscious colors and engaging music. The characters wind their way into your heart. Belle seeks a grander, less provincial life. The Beast arises unexpectedly to threaten her well-being, yet he also opens a doorway to that other life. Heroines and heroes rise to the occasion. A romantic melody plays out the hope of living happily ever after. I guess I am a romantic sort of soul.

The fact that it wastes bandwidth, batteries, and tracks privacy is bad enough, but I can at least live with that tradeoff in this age of Facebook. The fact that it installs a file onto your device without your permission and you cannot erase it after you uninstall should be illegal, in my opinion. Even using a File Manager to manually delete folders doesn't get rid of it completely.

B00008BXJ6|5.0|Well this is when we first found out who AC/DC were, course i wasn't born at the time but nevertheless it's a great cd. I always considered Jailbreak to be the first cd but this is their official International first cd. The line up was Angus Young-Lead, Malcolm Young-Rhythm, Bon Scott-Vocals, Mark Evans- Bass, Phil Rudd-Drums. This cd has alot of favorites on it, and here is the song list.<br /><br />It's A Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock n Roll)- 5/5 What else can you ask for ....it's a great AC/DC song that pretty much everyone knows, great guitar/bagpipe solo.<br /><br />Rock n Roll Singer - 4/5 One of many Bon Scott songs depicting his rock n roll lifestyle. Great<br /><br />The Jack 4/5- One of their only slower songs that comes close to a power ballad, the song of course is about a man getting STDs from a woman, but in the clever form of a card game.<br /><br />Live Wire - 4/5 Another great song, love the intro.<br /><br />TNT - 5/5 a classic AC/DC song that everyone knows, I love the riff and can listen to this over and over.<br /><br />Can I Sit Next to You Girl? - 4/5 this was actually AC/DC's first single. Pretty great song, it sounds a little different from the AC/DC sound though.<br /><br />Little Lover - 4/5 Another slower song about ....well sex.<br /><br />She's Got Balls - 4/5 Funny song, great riff.<br /><br />High Voltage - 5/5 Another hit of theirs, great riff, fantastic song.<br /><br />All in all a really great start to a terrific band. AC/DC forever
B007U1FEJE|5.0|It's amazing how good this record is, I think it's beautiful and if you love music you will too. 100 stars / 5
B006LSZECO|3.0|If I had written this review as soon as I finished  the book I would have given it only one star.  After thinking more about the book I realized if you like a slower moving book and don't mind strange endings then I would say this is a good book.  I did like the authors writing style and would try another book.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book has a great story, easy to read. Finished the trilogy in only 2 weeks.. you cannot stop, very exciting. Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is dispicable.  IT demoralizes and demeans women by romanticizing violent, deviant sadism and masochistic sexual behavior and sugar-coats with its creation of the two main characters:  Anastasia, a sweet, innocent 21 year old virgin who is so infatuated with the drop-dead gorgeous billionaire Christian Gray, that she will let him do anything...yes anything, no matter how sick and sordid, just to hold on to him.  There is nothing socially redeeming about this book, unless you want to learn how to be a submissive and battered woman.  IT is the sickest thing I have ever read, and if the woman was a down-and-out hooker, and the man was a seedy, pock-marked-faced slime-bucket, everyone would be turned off by this filth.<br />  I can see how it would appeal to those who have to live vicariously through characters in romance novels, but anyone with even half a brain will see it for what it is: exploitation of women.  For Anastasia,  The lure of money, airplanes, fancy cars, expensive gifts and being wanted by a severely emotionally-damaged, but handsome man has made her a whore.  Nothing about this book is appealing and it saddens me to think that the young girls who read this will think it's ok to allow themselves to be sex slaves.  This book is an embarrassment.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I started this on a rainy day.  It was the perfect backdrop for my little raindrops.  Could not put it down.  Interesting puzzles and soothing music along with lovely graphics.  A+
0684865130|5.0|I've read Catch 22 4 times over the last forty years and had the same reaction each time.  The first half I found very funny.  Eventually the humor become tiresome.  But this is not a fault of the novel; this is the novel's greatest achievement.  After ahwile I couldn't laugh.  I just very angry at the absurdity and cruelty of the war.
1936608898|5.0|If you've met Dallas and Melissa Hartwig of the Whole9, or followed their blog ([...]), then I'm sure you are aware of how comically entertaining and informative a book they've authored could be.  And that is exactly what you'll find in It Starts with Food.  So, stop reading and go pre-order.  If you are unfamiliar with them, read on!  It Starts with Food is one of the newest nutrition books that will guide you on a path to a healthy diet AND a healthy relationship with food.  It's just science-y enough to properly explain the reasons behind their opinions, and logical enough that you don't need to understand the science.  It's all about whether what you are putting into your mouth will make you more or less healthy... it truly is as simple as that.  They outline their \\"Good Food Standards\\" which food should conform to in order to optimize your health.  These break down into 4 easy criteria.  Food should:  * Promote a healthy psychological response.  * Promote a healthy hormonal response.  * Support a healthy gut.  * Support immune function and minimize inflammation.  The book covers a full 86 pages breaking down the science and reasoning behind these criteria before even beginning to extrapolate to what should or shouldn't be part of a healthy diet.  Everything is individualized back to YOU, and they outline a 30 day challenge to get your eating dialed in, enabling YOU to know exactly how the food you eat is affecting the way your body functions.  From there, you will find chapters providing strategies to lifelong success, and chapters covering specialty dietary requirements.  The appendix is packed with references to peer-reviewed journal articles, in case you are a science geek who wants to read up on the studies supporting these decisions.  Did I forget to mention the COLOR photos of amazing-looking meals with recipes included, created by Melissa Joulwan (author of Well-fed)?  That alone will up your kitchen inspiration.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is stupid.<br />I apologize for being for blunt, but thats the only way I can put it.<br />It saddens me to see that the world has come to think that this kind of crap is ideal to be a \\"bestseller\\".

B004LROUNG|4.0|The Litigators is a typical John Grisham novel, in that it involves several interesting characters who are lawyers or work with lawyers(many with very little \\"character\\" at all).  The book starts out introducing us to four major characters, all of which are troubled in their own special ways.  A small \\"kitchen sink\\" law office houses three of the characters, and they are always in some sort of disagreement.  The fourth character, David, comes from an upper class law firm, but he's had enough of his non-person status.  In the beginning of the book, he literally flees that huge firm and spends an entire day in a bar getting drunk.  Eventually, David finds the kitchen sink office and insists that they hire him immediately.<br /><br />David finds himself totally in love with his new job, as it offers real challenges within the world of the law, and he doesn't have to sell his soul to feel like he's useful there.<br /><br />Wally, one of the kitchen sink partners, is David's mentor, and he teaches David about this side of the law.  Though David is shocked at many things, he really begins to feel fulfilled there.<br /><br />I'm about halfway into the book, and it's beginning to become hard to put down now.  I really look forward to seeing what is to happen next.  John Grisham doesn't disappoint.
B002RI9ZPY|3.0|It was the conclusion of the trilogy. Lisbeth's character was defined more and learned more about her back ground and why she acted the way she did. To appreciate Lisbeth and her story, you have to read the three books to appreciate and understand the story. All in all, it was a good read and will hold your interest to the end. I would recommend this trilogy.
B000K4WLXA|1.0|This was the worst thing I've ever bought. What I got wasn't even close to what you showed it was. This was just a double pack feature. Nothing like the pictures, packaging, cards of the characters. It was truly disappointing and made me really angry
B005NGKMOU|5.0|This movie has great combination of story, visuals and action. Tha characteres are very interesting to watch with great actors and the story moves in a unique speed combined with unique visuals and photography.
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet. Joe Bonamassa's soulful guitar wizardry seems to tame Beth Hart's rough vocal edges. While Hart's haunting soulful voice elevates Bonamassa's artistry to sheer perfection. A combo that works, hope they put out another album.
030758836X|1.0|After reading rave reviews, I bought this book.  Found the characters thoroughly unlikeable and crude.  What's the point of dropping the F-bomb in every other sentence, except to reveal offensive characters?  I can't relate to any of the favorable reviews.  After reading 70 pages I skipped to the end just to see what happened.  The ending, too, is disappointing, dark and depressing.  I'll never buy another book by this author.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book is without doubt the most graphic book I've read in a long time.  So far the sexual content overpowers the story.  Don't know if I would buy it again.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|First of all, this film is intelligent but still asks the viewer to suspend disbelief for stretches of the film. Hopefully, you would be invested in the film by that time and won't mind any of these stretches.<br />The premise of the film centers around a man trying to find a cure for alzheimer's. So he works on viruses that would fight against that disease and even repair damage and increase brain power. So, of course, they test it on monkeys and look for side effects.<br />I don't think I'm spoiling any secrets by saying the drug does indeed make the apes smarter and significantly and quickly. There are a series of logical events that lead to the eventual 'rise' of the apes.<br />The culmination of this occurs on Golden Gate Bridge, which serves as a literal gateway for the apes to their intended new home and from their human oppressors. So they duke it out.<br /><br />There are lapses in logic here and there once we accept the virus and its effects. Are they worth even mentioning? Only if you are a nitpicker with every film. I'm not. I enjoyed this film much more than I expected.<br /><br />The CGI apes are incredibly well done. As are the rest of the visuals. It's a stunning film to watch. The interplay between the apes and the progression of the film was very impressive. It was smart. The filmmakers obviously did a lot of homework. It was simultaneously fascinating, spooky and sad at times to watch this film because the emotions of the apes, particularly Caesar, were so convincing.<br /><br />The cast? Very good. I do think that Pinto was underused and I would hope in the sequel she would be more than just the cute girlfriend. Or maybe she isn't really that good an actress and just needs to be pretty? I don't know. This is the only film of hers I've seen.<br /><br />The film feels like part I of a trilogy. I can see it now and won't say why because it involves spoilers but the ending of this film feels like it is moving towards the central part of a certain obvious story arc.<br /><br />It is not quite as brilliant or shocking as the original Planet of the Apes. It is, however, second only to that fine film of all the 'apes' films. Especially the clunky and silly Tim Burton film. But this is a much smarter film and doesn't go for cheap gimmicks. The makers of this film clearly respected the story and wanted to make more than just another blockbuster. This is a film that will provide you with food for thought.
B003O86FMW|5.0|good plot, good bad guy, i like the characters and root for them. looking forward to the last book.<br /><br />only negative is since this is wrtitten from katniss's point of view i grow weary of her inner dialouge; (trying to be vague here) especially when what she's thinking is so obviously different from what it actually taking place.<br /><br />i often find myself wishing peeta was the main character of the story instead of her. and i also think they cheapen him a little bit by not really letting us know anyting about him other than he paints, bakes, and loves katniss.
B0086700CM|5.0|it awesome it the best game on earth. it so fun to I cant wait till they make a new game if they will

B005HSG3VK|4.0|The case is lightweight, the kindle snaps in and stays put it was very easy to put the kindle in the case.<br />The case is easy to manipulate from open to closed and the soft inside of the front cover ensures the screen will not be scratched. Its has an pleasing feel in the hands and enough texture that it will not easily slip from your grasp.<br />The elastic securing strap is tight enough to secure the cover with enough play to open and close the cover. The only negative is the stand is not the most secure. The stand is flexible and you need to make sure it stays in the grove or it will fall flat with the weight of the kindle.<br />I recomend this product and give it a 4 out of 5 star rating.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I didn't have any problems with this game and its design is really cool.  you star out with a few colors and you can buy more and more colors as you get more money. I don't really have to use the bombs that often but you can also buy more of those if you want. they have a variety of colors and it is really fun to play with friends.although I haven't found out how to quit games, the simple but interesting game never gets boring.
B0086700CM|3.0|Love this fast paced game!  But I'm getting bored with it...  We need an update.  Also,  why do all of the characters play the same?  They should have different strengths &amp; weaknesses to change the game up a bit.  We were really disappointed after working so hard to unlock those only to find out they ALL play the same... BORING!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really fun fut it gets kinds boring. I recemend getting it though once u start playing it again its not boring anymore
0439023521|5.0|While reading this book i found myself on a emotional joyride. The auther f this book gave the reader so much detail that i could literally draw the picture in my head. The was she introduced characters, the sentence fluency, and most of all the setting really completed this book. There are some authers who like to rush the story but ive found that Suzanne Collins knows exactly how to write a book. This book/trilogy is one of my favorites. I will show these books to the children i will have. This story is simply a masterpiece

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Besides being horribly written, this book should not be included in the public library book list. A more appropriate place for it would be the adult book store.
0345803507|2.0|I read the trilogy with the hope it would inspire. The storyline drugged a bit and the adult entertainment these books are known for seriously left a lot to be desired.
B000069KE0|5.0|Steven Wilson finally fixed it after a 47 year wait!!  Arguably the finest performance of Chicago's career, although many might argue that C.T.A. or Chicago V is their own favorite.  This album has been legendary ever since 1970 as being one of the flattest and dullest sounding albums in the history of rock.  Something awful happened in 1970 during the mixing stage from the 16 track recording masters down to the two-track stereo master.   Well, fret no longer.........   Steven Wilson was asked by the surviving members of the band Chicago to take possession the original 16 track recording session tapes and work his mix-down magic on them.  Wilson has succeed.  If you've been waiting since 1970 to hear what Chicago II was REALLY supposed to originally sound like, buy this CD.  Fabulous job, Steven!!
B0088TG252|5.0|Good movie. In the same genre as Bourne Identity with the smooth acting that Denzel brings to a bad guy character with a few morals to keep it interesting. Ryan is good also.<br /><br />Definately worth the watch. Not top 10 material but you will not be disappointed if you like international, CIA, fights and mild twists
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King once again comes through with a winner.  It's a beautifully written page-turner that will keep you involved until the very end.
0857520652|5.0|The thing I like the most about this book was its distinct British-ness.  Harold Fry, the quintessential English gentleman, is defined by his manners and his unobtrusiveness.  But when he receives a letter from his dying former colleague Queenie, something inside him shifts, and he is motivated to walk the length of England to see her.  Queenie herself is a bit of an enigma, but throughout the narrative, she is a beacon.  As Harold walks, he ruminates over his life, his estranged marriage, his absentee son, and the parents who never wanted him.  His journey is also an evolution, as he learns to engage strangers despite their strangeness and to rely on nature and the kindness of others. His progress is marked as Harold's confidence surges and falters. At one point he picks up media attention and entourage (much like Forrest Gump), and these misguided pilgrims force another change in Harold's determination.<br /><br />It isn't until he is about to give up sixteen miles from his goal that the profound revelations that have driven the entire plot are disclosed.  The way Harold sheds the weight of guilt and the shame of how he has lived his life is significant and moving.  It was so worth taking the journey with him for the eloquent finality of the conclusion.  The writing is beautiful (and did I mention oh-so-British?) and fraught with emotion, but satisfying in its simplicity and directness.  I really enjoyed getting to know Harold and his wife and the many intricacies of their situation.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher.

B006RUJST6|5.0|What a great read! Great flow to the story, lots of ups and downs for the main characters Lake and Will... grab a kleenix cause your going to need it for the 2nd book. Looking forward to reading more books by this author. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I was a little taken aback by the vision of the martian cites. Having read the books as a child and adult you have a certain look in your minds eye!But the film had some issues but none that would have let the movie be rated as low as it was by critics. I would like them to make a sequel, and flesh out Mars and many main characters better. These books are wonderful and need to be made into films.

1781161097|4.0|This is a gorgeous, lavishly illustrated, 187-page hardcover book that takes viewers behind the scenes into the artistic creation of \\"Prometheus.\\" Pre-production artwork, CGI mock-ups and on-set photographs mix with text from author Mark Salisbury that dives into Ridley Scott's creative process, with the director offering some thoughts as to how what he originally conceived as an \\"Alien\\" prequel evolved into something quite different than what some anticipated. The layout and design of the book is satisfying indeed, marked by crisply detailed images including evocative shots of \\"The Deacon\\" that weren't utilized in the final film. While not a thorough production history (as the title states, this is primarily an \\"art book\\"), fans should be captivated by the lavish presentation here, and considering that the book already in its third printing, there's a chance this could become a collector's item down the line. Either way, at under $25 currently on Amazon, \\"The Art of Prometheus\\" comes strongly recommended for fans.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This was a great movie that was interestingly sophisticated and fun to watch the whole way through.<br /><br />Today's movies can definitely take hint, but probably won't.<br /><br />Movies like this go underrated/overlooked/ignored/neglected and movies like avengers and avatar gross $2 billion, which is complete nonsense.<br /><br />Being under 25 I can kind of understand why no one knew anything about this movie my age but it's easy to notice how today's generation lacks enthusiasm.<br /><br />If you're someone who never likes watching romance movies, give this movie a chance and keep an open mind. A lot great people in history are mentioned like Ernest Hemmingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso and many many more.<br />I thought at some point Shakespeare might pop up, as Owen Wilson keeps going further and further in to the past.<br />Sadly Shakespeare didn't show up.<br /><br />Adrian Broody has a small role as Salvador Dali whom I don't know much about but is just too funny to ignore.<br /><br />I know all the other reviews say basically the same thing I just said but I just wanted to add more fuel to the fire.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had a hard time getting into this book at first, but as the plot starts opening up, I simply couldn't put it down.  This is not a book you want someone looking over your shoulder reading because it can get quite graphic and steamy at times.  The character of Anastasia needs to be a little stronger and more defined, but then she is supposed to be very young and quite innocent which is very unusual in this day and age.  And, of course, Christian's character is very undefined as he should be, thus the name.....Fifty Shades of 'Grey' a pun on Christian's name as well as the plot. I immediately downloaded the second book as soon as I finished the first, mainly 'cause it leaves you hanging as all good starters to a series should. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes a new spin on romance, if that's what you can call Anastasia's and Christian's relationship.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I thought this series went down hill after the first, excellent Hunger Games. It gets darker and darker (the Hunger Games was dark enough but had a redeeming \\"catharsis\\"). By the end of the final book, I felt no redemption; no way of feeling anything but depressed. The author's vision of human nature in this final work is dismal Well, to be fair, it is pretty dismal all the way through, it is just that I found no way to feel as if I had learned something or was in any way enlighten by the end. I find this is  very difficult, in fact, impossible, to recommend this book though I recommend the Hunger Games very positively (but with a caution).
034580404X|5.0|These books were so well written. I fell in love with the characters and the dominance with submissive, the rich lifestyle. I couldn't put these books down and for that reason I give them 5 stars. I also love the way the last book ended, going back to the beginning and showing us what Christian Grey was really like on the inside that we didn't see in the first book. I hated it when I was finished and had no more to read. Now I can't wait for the movie, I can see myself reading these books again.
B005FVFWOI|1.0|The album itself, of course, warrants a 5 star rating.  It is a classic in the annals of rock music.  This \\"remix,\\" however, is poorly done.  Quite frankly, I cannot understand why otherwise intelligent people continue to let Steven Wilson get his inept hands on their perfectly good recordings.  Understand that my complaint is not as a purist; that is to say, the fact that it was remixed at all is not what bothers me (although, incidentally, I am left to wonder why anyone would bother to remix an already well-mixed album).  It is the fact that it is remixed so poorly.<br /><br />The whole idea of mixing, the reason it is called mixing, is that the different elements in the music are mixed differently, to create the overall effect desired.  Some instruments will be higher in the mix, and others lower.  That is because you have the main elements of the song, and you have those that are there for flavour.  Someone needs to tell Mr. Wilson that mixing means just that: mixing.  Unfortunately, what he has done here is to bring everything to the front.  So now, every part, no matter how incidental, is up front in the mix.  If this were Mixing 101, he would have flunked.  I'll give you a few specific song examples of what I'm talking about:<br /><br />Aqualung:  The main riff is of course an important part of the two \\"bookend\\" pieces of this song.  Everybody knows that riff.  The main riff is played on one guitar, and there is a second guitar harmonizing it.  It is called the main riff because it is the primary guitar part we are meant to hear.  But on this mix, the harmonizing guitar is so loud that the ear is lead to focus on it as much as, if not more so (since it is a higher pitch) than the main riff.  This is, thankfully, not during the intro part of the riff, which everyone immediately thinks of when they think of this song, but during the parts of the riff that Ian Anderson sings over.<br /><br />Mother Goose:  Perhaps the worst offender here.  This is essentially anacoustic song, with occasional electric guitar added for a bit of flavour.  Hence its inclusion in the compilation \\"Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull.\\"  The electric guitar only shows up briefly here and there.  In the original mix, this blended in well, and was part of the overall soundscape.  Here, however, the electric is up so loud in the mix it is jarring, because it starts and stops so suddenly and is so to the fore.  It is like an intrusion on the song, rather than part of the backdrop.<br />One more thing in this song that irritated me, and I imaging this was the source of an earlier reviewer's comment about \\"vocal noises\\" or something like that, that they hadn't noticed in the original mix.  There's a part after Ian sings the line, \\"and his sister's weird, she drives a lorry,\\" where he then makes a sort of \\"hm\\" noise, as if in reaction to what he just said.  In the original, this was mixed in relation to the rest of the vocals, so was somewhat softer than the singing, and made a non-intrusive, humorous sort of addition, that always got a smile out of me.  In this mix, the vocals are suddenly turned way up for that moment, so that Ian practically shouted \\"hm\\" into my ear, which is very unnatural and jarring, since you cannot actually shout a noise like that.<br /><br />(There were many other specific examples from each song that I wanted to include here, but for the sake of space I am focusing on the worst, and most immediately apparent offenders.)<br /><br />It is as if Steven Wilson was so enamored of this album, that he felt it his duty to ensure that every listener, no matter how casual, hear every part that there is to hear, on first listen.  It is a fan boy's mix, not a professional's.  Again, the whole point of mixing, is that you give priority to certain parts, and keep some in the backdrop, to create a rich tapestry of sound.  Also, this has always been part of the joy of Jethro Tull music: there are so many little things going on in the music, that youcan still be discovering things after your 30th listen to the album.  The \\"mix\\" on this CD, unfortunately, destroys that element, as well as the basic purpose of mixing in the first place.  There is absolutely nothing in this mix that is not in the original, it is simply that everything has been pushed up.  If you listened to the older editions closely, you will hear everything, in its proper proportion.  This is, quite simply, a bad mix.  Let's just hope they never let Steven Wilson near an album like Sgt. Pepper!  Imagine the cacophony that would ensue!<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to have checked this out from my local library, and so was saved from wasting money on it.  I am also fortunate enough to own the DCC gold disc, which is the original mix in what is possibly the best remaster of this that we'll ever get.  I wish I could recommend that one to you all but it is, sadly, out of print.  However, another reviewer has stated that the British import version is equivalent to that remaster.  I do not have said import, so cannot verify this, but if true I urge you all to go for that edition, and skip this sad excuse for a remix.  If you are absolutely dying to hear the bonus tracks provided here, download the MP3s for a buck apiece, or better yet, get this from your library and have a listen before you spend any money on it.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|This was great. Clear clean picture, it run great. NO problems opening & running this app. Can'wait to get the next season
B007MU85D0|5.0|I can't rate the album down for Amazon's silliness, but I truly hate the fact that Amazon is selling two versions of this, one that includes a digital booklet, for the same price.  I bought the non-booklet version, but I would have loved to see the booklet with more information and perhaps lyrics--I have no idea what's in it.  But to get it, I'd now have to buy the album over again. . . be careful!  Find the version with the booklet if you're interested in buying this--and you should be, because it's a wonderful album.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I enjoy puzzle and logic games, but I have spent many hours playing this game now, and I am only half way through the puzzles.  Also, they keep adding new ones in the updates.  Definitely enjoy this.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|This was such a great movie, I loved how it shined a light at how difficult it is for trans people to live in a world that is obsessed with gender rules. At the end of the day gender is irrelevant to the kind of person one is and how great a parent/role model they can be. Felicity Huffman was amazing, so believable, she did a fantastic job with everything from her voice to the way she was always fidgety.<br /><br />*Spoilerish*<br /><br />I also really appreciated Toby's character in the fact that it wasn't the typical judgmental hate turned love and the issue was more that he felt betrayed by the Church story.
B005QUQRE2|4.0|As most people have mentioned, the sci-fi aspects support the narrative in this film and propel the characters forward as opposed to the converse where the actors fall prey to becoming mere props facilitating the action sequences and sci-fi twists. In other words, the underlying theme of \\"things not being what they are supposed to be\\" is prominent but serves as the backdrop setting for the emotional journey the characters are undertaking. This concept may seem boring, and sadly it isn't box office material. However, this isn't to say the film doesn't have its proper place in cinema; I would simply have a hard time categorizing it as pure entertainment. Like 2001 - A Space Odyssey, this film has the capacity of reaching out to all individuals because of the universal subject matter it speaks of, in this film specifically shame, guilt and atoning for one's trespasses, whether they are deliberate or not.<br /><br />The empowerment of Another Earth comes from its ability to make the audience feel present effectively blurring the line between audience and screen. This magic originates from a good screenplay, decent acting, great cinematography and brilliant story-telling instead of relying on the substantial use of computer graphics or 3-d effects. Some may see this as the problem of the film while the majority (from the reviews I've read) will appreciate the unembellished surface and distinct soundness the filmmakers have created.<br /><br />I won't kid you, like other viewers I also questioned the validity of the premise - a planet like ours popping out of nowhere? Come on, get real. And then, once I had accepted the possibility of a planet emerging, I started asking myself how it could even be possible for a second planet to exist so closely to the original Earth without interfering with our gravitational pull. I'd like to believe that the filmmakers chose not to address the questions rather than ignoring them completely; if so, I can only theorize they did so in an effort at maintaining the integrity of the story they were telling against turning the film into an episode of NOVA.<br /><br />Bottom line: The premise is simple yet compelling and lends itself to an experience you either regard as thoughtful or insipid, with strong dramatic tension leading the charge as the story is set in motion. However, I would pass this film up if you feel unanswered questions will annoy/disturb you; accepting the questions as accommodating in the same manner explosions are specifically audible in all Star Wars films (sound in space?) will allow you to adjust your viewing stance and recognize the insight of Another Earth.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a pretty good game. it helps pass time up. but some of the games are just really hard.but its pretty good
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book was actually boring and the characters were unreal.  I cannot relate to sadism and permissive behavior.  The sexual encounters were unbelievable  I can't imagine a woman who allows her self to be in that situation.  At a certain point I stopped reading because I could see this was going to be repetitions of sexual encounters.  I dont'agree with the ratings<br />to buy this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so happy when temple run finally came to kindle fire.  tons of fun great for calming me down i love it
B000OIBY4Y|4.0|In this 128 page book we glimpse into the world of the absurd. Not absurd because of far-out fantasy but absurd because the story depicts the lack of meaning of life from an existential perspective. The picture of existence is brought forth as individual data bits of life. Nothing seems connected; there is no thread of meaning. The protagonist Meursault fits in with this ridiculous picture as he simply reacts to the stimulus of existence without adding anything of value. He reacts like a brute animal. Meursault attempts to come to peace with this thought while facing his death. For the reader, there is no peace.<br /><br />I am reading this book from a Christian perspective. In this story I see a picture of the natural world without God. Camus has the courage to take this worldview to it's logical and meaningless conclusion which most are not willing to do. For this reason I would recommend reading this book.  However if God is, then we are not doomed to nihilism but to the meaningful. We are not a vapor but we are connected to an eternity of significance. We are not trapped within the absurd but live united to the Logos
0345803485|2.0|I frankly got bored with this book---didn't have to wonder what the ending would be---it wasn't hard to figure out and did not care enough about the  story to continue reading the second and third book...The fact of somebody getting spanked with a leather belt,etc. did nothing for me.
0345803493|1.0|Well, all I can say is if you love book one then you will love this one also. Smirking, flushing, frowning ( a lot of it) and butt plugs. Who cares about the dialogue if you have crazy sex and butt plugs.

1469984202|5.0|I just finished the omnibus Wool and I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend the evening of my 45th birthday than with a quart of butter pecan ice cream and a fantastic tale on my new kindle.  I am very happy to find another great storyteller.  To anyone who is thinking of reading Wool, stop thinking and start reading!  The last time I was this excited discovering an author was finding I, robot in elementary school.  I am looking forward to reading Wool 6 and browsing any other titles Mr. Howey has and will produce.  The depth of character from page one is stunning.  I turned every page seeing a complete person with none of the akwardness so many authors stumble through in the early stages of their stories.  The crisp detail of the welds, the vividness of desolation, the poignancy of despair and the \\"choking gall and preserving sweet\\" of love all conspired to while away my hours timelessly.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Love the movie and the price was right. Glad to find it so easily. Bought the movie on my phone while I was hunting.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had heard alot about these books and they were highly recommended but I did not like the premise and thought I would not like reading them.  However, once you start you can not put them down.  It is a fairly fast read and the subject matter is handled well.  I am now looking forward to seeing the first movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First, let me say, I am a Twihard. However, I knew nothing about this book until all the hype started and I read this based only on the hype. I wish I hadn't. The writing was horrible. There was no story and I can't stand either characters. Christian's controlling and punishing ways and the way Ana kept going back to him made me sick. I have nothing against erotica, heck I've wrote some but this just disgusted me. Example, he leaves hickie's all over her body just so she'll stay covered from neck down as punishment. She gets mad but is immediately ready to jump in bed with him again. He likes inflicting pain upon her, it makes him feel in control... it's wrong. I don't understand why people continue reading it. I regret reading this trilogy. At least I did not spend money on them. There are better books out there, I advise reading those instead.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I know the premise behind the book is a little \\"different,\\" but it has a good story line. I'm on the second book now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have been traveling a lot recently and couldn't find a game to keep me busy...hen I found this one and its been great to kill time! :)

B000XGDO04|3.0|I live in South Korea and only just became aware of this singer named Adele. Since I'm not often seen without my headphones on, a friend suggested that I check out this young, acclaimed singer's work. Here were my impressions.<br /><br />ADELE'S VOICE: Is there any contention on this point? The woman has a liquid, caramel voice. She truly is a beautiful singer. There are times in the songs when she feels like maybe she's pushing her abilities. Apparently the album title is based on her age when she recorded it, and there are a few points where she seems to try embellishments that sound a little forced. Perhaps age and experience will help her both stretch her range and give her more of an artist's sense when the curlicues of sound are a boon and when they detract. Overall, however, I can't fault her for trying, and the rest of her work is really gorgeous.<br /><br />THE PRODUCTION: It's been said before, and I'll mention it here: this album sounds both under- and over-produced. Some songs seem to have a gritty, unfinished quality, as if they were engineered by someone equally as young and inexperienced as Adele. Other songs have an excessive amount of instrumentation or strange electronic additions that feel ill-advised. It doesn't take too much away from Adele's skill, but it does diminish the record's appeal.<br /><br />THE SONGS: No offense, but a lot of these songs sound exactly the same to me. I think this is probably because every single song, except for the last one, is about how confusing, frustrating, or incomplete Adele's love life is. If you're not one to listen to lyrics, then ignore this part. If, like me, you can't help but listen to the words, then you might find yourself rolling your eyes at Adele's constant (and lyrically immature) yen for love, as well as her pretty trite descriptions of the tingles and melting that accompany being \\"in love\\" with someone. I'm not saying 19 year-olds don't know anything about love, but I am saying that I can't remember the last time one of them ever said or wrote anything about love that was new, incisive, or just plain poetic. The worst example of this is \\"Right as Rain,\\" where Adele opines that nobody wants to be happy because that makes it harder to deal when you end up sad again. This is the kind of ironic faux-profundity that sounds deep when you're thinking it, but which crumbles under examination.<br /><br />The music itself has some interesting variations. I couldn't get into the album's biggest hit -- Chasing Pavement; it sounds like something that would play in the background at a mall to me. However, some of the later tracks had enough new energy to detract from the abysmal lyrics. \\"My Same\\" is probably my favorite from the album -- a peppy blues-ish number. Many of the other songs, however, sound crafted around the same sliding scale as Adele's voice. While her voice is amazing, this makes for some redundant melodies.<br /><br />A gorgeous voice is not enough for me if it is tied to poor production and poor writing, just as an amazing story can be ruined by someone screaming it into your ear through a megaphone. I've heard her next album completely blows this one out of the water, so I'm on board for it, but if you're in anyway nit-picky about your music or unsure if this record is for you, I'd recommend avoiding it.ber the last time one of them ever said or wrote anything about love that was new, incisive, or just plain poetic.

B00846TRHY|5.0|Have you ever been somewhere, so far away from home that it is hard to imagine the life you will return to after your travels? And on those travels, have you ever witnessed something so horrible that it is hard to imagine anything like that happening back home? Whether you have or haven't, this film illustrates how it feels, and evokes the emotions one would be filled with when confronted by atrocities like those that many africans face on a daily basis, in places like Yuganda & Sudan.<br /><br />If you can handle realizing that so many people, need so much help, while you are sitting there watching a movie, then watch this one. It will inspire you, it did me; to make whatever differences back home that you can. And someday make differences elsewhere as well. Peace.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book reminds me so much of Fifty Shades of Grey but I find this more erotic and sexy. Both characters are a mess but together they are able to work their relationship out, creating intense physical and emotional connection and great, explosive sex! The love story is beautiful despite its complications. It is a kind of love that everyone should have or at least should at least experience once in a lifetime.
1936608898|5.0|I've had this book for only five days now, and love it. The authors have a simple & humorous way of explaining what's important, food. It's everywhere, we can't get away from it, nor we want to get away from it. I've learned how food can be a help to my body and how it can slowly damage my body; I've learned how a simple choice can build a lifetime of health and vitality. And I've only ready three chapters! This is one book I will ready over and over. I've already started making some of the recipes, DELICIOUS!!!

B007MAETA8|5.0|For all the people here saying that he should go back to his \\"early days,\\" there's plenty of Berkelee grads that would LOVE your attention. Born And Raised is simple, mellow and excellent. No crazy jazz licks or extended solos, just pure honest music with a country feel. He isn't singing about pick up trucks and days on the farm but its a great departure from his chart-busting hits. More artists need to step away from the programming and pick up an acoustic. Great work John!

B006UG90RM|4.0|Music was great. Lots of energy and hooks, great guitar playing. Much better than I thought it would be.<br /><br />Reservations:<br /><br />1. A bit too much filler. This would have been a great 11 song album.<br /><br />2. DLR - Vocals and lyrics are, for the most part, bloody awful. Even by his standards.<br /><br />3. No Michael Anthony. Just on principle he should be there.<br /><br />Three and a half stars if I could.

Basada en la historia real de la Compañía Easy desde el entrenamiento en Carolina del Norte hasta que toman el Nido del Águila en los Alpes.<br />Además de la historia en sí y de cómo está representada hasta en el más mínimo detalle, es una buena clase de lo que fue la II Guerra Mundial; sobretodo en lo humano.<br />Esta versión cuenta con buenos subtítulos al español, además de material extra que ayuda a seguir la serie, como glosario de vocabulario militar, detalle de la cadena de mando del ejército de EE.UU., un mapa para seguir el transcurso de la Compañía Easy y biografías resumidas de los soldados de la compañía.<br />Recomendación: no ver el documental hasta no haber visto toda la serie.<br />Saludos!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have no idea how this book (actually the set of 5 books in one) happened to pop up in my Amazon recommendations but I am so glad that it did.  I just finished the first series of 5 (the Omnibus edition) and I must say that this is one of the best stories I've read in many years.  An original, gripping tale that builds and builds and once you hit book 4 and 5, you won't be able to stop reading until you reach the end.  I sincerely hope that Hugh Howey continues the series.  I'll be starting the \\"prequel\\" next and look forward to more stories in the future.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Also, this series, if properly done, would make an EPIC movie.  Hopefully we'll see that happen some day.
B003O85W3A|5.0|I honestly cannot handle how much I love Arcade Fire. If you were a fan of their last two albums, or a fan of contemporary alternative music in general, this will NOT disappoint. With so many mediocre bands out there, I am thankful for the quality music Arcade Fire continues to create. Definitely one of my all time favorite bands.

B0073PPKNM|2.0|Gardot's new album title, The Absence\\"  is fitting because her voice is absent.  On most tracks she merges into the music and her subdued, whispery words fade into the background.  A great talent made a great mistake with this album.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I was looking forward to all the different games.  Some games work while others do not fit the screen properly.  The answers are completely blocked.  I can not even tell how many points I have. Could have been so much more fun.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|The main issue with a lot of the negative reviews seem to be that people wanted this movie to be something different. If you check that expectation at the door and watch it with a fresh mind you'll have a great experience. The visuals were stunning, the only other time 3D was this amazing was Avatar. The story is engaging and enough was left for the imagination to make you exited for potential sequels.<br /><br />It's not a five star movie for a few reasons (may contain spoilers):<br /><br />- the movie felt too short, it seems like certain things should have been explained better such as the motivation of the engineers in the very beginning potentially creating humanity and in their desire to later destroy it. Maybe this is left to the imagination or for sequels, but a little more background would have been nice.<br /><br />- there was a crew of 17 but most of them had little no screen time or simply disappeared, this should have been fleshed out better, again this may have needed more time or was cut out<br /><br />- many pointed this out but crew behaviour was reckless, the biologist getting cute with the snake, people putting their fingers in all sorts of questionable things and messing with stuff better left alone and in general no respect for the environment<br /><br />- David's motivation for infecting the other guy was not clear to me. It seems like these androids are a lot of trouble to have around because every other mission they go bad.<br /><br />All in all a great ride, having my hopes up for the extended edition to maybe make this a 5 star movie...
0061692042|4.0|While the title suggests a book about the country, and there is a great deal of natural description, the focus of this novel is quite different.  This is a book that takes the reader beyond plot and story into some new emotional and moral terrain.  It's about a boy crossing borders, physical and metaphorical, and coming to hard choices about how to lead life as a decent human being.  15-year-old Dell, along with his twin sister, are left on their own when their parents are imprisoned for bank robbery.  While the sister leaves Montana for San Francisco, Dell is taken to Canada where he falls under the influence of a violent man.  He must ultimately decide whether and how to live a decent life, be a decent man.  While there might be issues of plausibility and repetition along the way, this is overall a pretty good read that provides some insight into life and its possibilities.  That, it seems to me, is one of the best possible achievements of realistic fiction.
0345803485|2.0|I happened to be reading Catherine Coulter's \\"Sherbrooke Bride\\" at the same time and could not believe the similaties with 50 Shades. Same plot, characters, sex, and poor writing style. I gave two stars for the two best characters Her inner goddess and her conscious.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I love Rush....I have loved them since 1977, after hearing the album Fly By Night. That Christmas, I got A Farewell To Kings and thought it was one of the greatest albums I have ever heard (and over 34 years later, I still do!). I want to love all of their albums as much as the two albums I just mentioned, but I don't think that will be happening with Clockwork Angels. It certainly is a challenging and sometimes baffling listen. I got the fanpack edition of this 5 days ago and I am still trying to fully comprehend and appreciate this album. I have listened to it on my home computer, at work, in my kitchen while washing dishes. I want to love this album. I want to give it five stars and say that it's their greatest album ever. But I can't..at least not yet...<br /><br />Problems? First...and foremost...is Geddy's vocals. Like the last two of three albums before, there is just too much singing on Clockwork Angels...at least too much singing for me. And it does not help in the least that Geddy's vocal melodies (for the most part) are aimless and all over the place. And I'm not sure I am loving his voice anymore, especially his upper register. I mean, it is nice that he still has so much of his upper register this late in his career, it would just be nice if he used it and/or controlled it better. Some melodic vocal lines do pop up here and there, like in the line \\"I can't stop thinking big\\" from the song Caravan and for the refrain for 'The Wreckers', but I don't think they pop up enough, especially for how much singing there is!<br /><br />Second problem is the song structures themselves, which are too complex and jarring and chaotic at times. It's like Rush had a million ideas and wanted to play them all at once in the same song and at the same time! Shame, too, for there are a number of great heavy and catchy guitar riffs, like on 'Carnies', 'Headlong Flight', 'Caravan\\" and 'Seven Cities Of Gold'. The band is still playing extremely well and there are plenty of instrumental sections here, though are no instrumentals on the album (and it is an album that could desperately use one..or two...).<br /><br />Rush aren't afraid to acknowledge their musical past on this....one of the riffs for the title track is lifted from 'Double Agent' and one of the guitar riffs for 'The Anarchist' sounds similar to a guitar riff from 'Beneath, Between, Behind'. I believe it may be my favorite guitar riff on the whole album. As for my favorite song (and I am writing this part 4 or 5 days after I originally published my review), I would say it would have to be \\"Headlong Flight\\". I think it is the most exciting song on the album and the one that reminds me the most of early Rush. This is the one song I find myself going back to the most. I also think \\"The Garden\\" is quite lovely, though even here I wish Geddy would not sing so much and let the music do more of the talking.<br /><br />There is some good music here, to be sure and I like the fact that Rush are being ambitious and still pushing themselves as musicians and doing a concept album (which seem to be in fashion again). The fact that I'm not sure what the exact concept is (or..sadly... don't really care!) doesn't figure into my overall opinion of the album. I like the piano on the album's closing track 'The Garden'. I like the heaviness of the album and that Rush aren't afraid to get a bit more mellow near the end of the album. I like that there are (for the first time since Moving Pictures) a few songs that exceed the seven minute mark (in this case, two) But...I was hoping for something more...or perhaps something more immediate and instantly likable. And stronger songs...and more melodic and catchy vocal lines...and less singing....and more popcorn and cookies. I like this album, and I keep listening to it again and again in the hopes that I will grow to love it (which is not the best reason to keep listening to an album!). I do find myself humming some of guitar riffs and one or two of the vocal melodies over and over again, which is not surprising, given how much I have been listening to it. So, I can't hate it that much, eh? I am giving Clockwork Angels a respectable three stars. I like this album and I am recommending it by the way (hence my three star rating), but I think they have done much better.e vocal melodies over and over again, which is not surprising, given how much I have been listening to it.

B005LAIGPA|5.0|My husband brought this movie home, and while the premise sounded intriguing, I was a bit disappointed to hear that Chronicle might be one of those manically videotaped Blair Witch Project type of film.<br /><br />Yes, the movie does have handheld camera elements, but after the first twenty minutes, the camera not only becomes integral to the storytelling...but also the theme (observing and analyzing life rather than truly living it).<br /><br />Anyway, we just got done watching Chronicle and to call it \\"gripping\\" almost seems like a cliche...but it's an apt description.<br /><br />I won't go over plot details because others have done so. What surprised and thrilled me about this movie (that has now bumped [[ASIN:B0002WT4OE Joy Ride]] out of my \\"favorite movie\\" spot) is:<br /><br />1. The acting. Totally believable high school dudes with distinct personalities. And Andrew's background sets the stage for what happens when a marginalized, bullied and abused kid finally gets the power to fight back.<br /><br />2. Special effects. For me, special effects have to SUPPORT a story for me to like it...not just be there to try to wow the crowd. I have no idea how they filmed the amazing flying stuff, but it was just...CRAZY. Crazy good. There were times--I kid you not--when I became aware that my mouth was hanging open.<br /><br />3. Intense plot that escalates. Just when you think it can't get worse...it does. I reached out for my husband's hand more than once...and squeezed the living daylights out of it. My heart still feels like it's trying to calm down from the experience (and it's been about 20 minutes since it was over!)<br /><br />4. The ending. It rocked. Totally satisfying.<br /><br />Like Joyride, there's some funny parts...at first (especially when they're in the toy store messing around with their new-found \\"gifts\\"). There's some emotional roller-coaster stuff going on as well, with Andrew's home life. So combining the emotional range of this film with the special effects, acting and satisfying ending...<br /><br />Wait. Are you still here? For crying out loud, you should be watching Chronicle already! ;o)<br /><br />-- Janet Boyer, author of lots of stuffal effects, acting and satisfying ending...<br /><br />Wait. Are you still here?

B007U1FEJE|4.0|first of all thanks to the beach boys for making an album with real music. so rare these days. my advice is to put on the headphones and settle in. i read a few reviews just to make sure i was not crazy but i too heard some auto pitch in the background harmonies. but hey, let's see michael jordan hit three pointers with out some sort of bracing when he is 70. again thanks to the beach boys and i'm back to my headphones to let it wash over me. quit expecting pet sounds or sunflower and you may be happy with this. peace out.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is super addicting!!! I just can't stop playing it.  Both of my daughters also love playing this game!!
B007H9B6KA|4.0|I've read some reviews here that seem to have there own ideas about this band. I collect them, listened to them from the beginning and this one is worth the wait. There are also 2 other versions available of this one to boot with bonus tracks. Anyway, look, if your seeking out as one reviewer said the \\"Garbage\\" of old well, move on, no band stays the same, always change in sound, production etc. The album is solid from top to bottom. All the bonus tracks are great as well. This is a album from a band that wanted it to sound this way, over production, compression, etc it appears is the way they wanted it. Anyway, if your a fan or collector like myself, then you'll enjoy it. Others will not like some reviews here, all in ones way of perceiving it. I really liked it, my opinion but, check out NME, they were not fans of it. Oh well, give it a listen and you be the judge.<br />Drop by my Website sometime for a visit @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\".
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I'm starting to think it was a waste of $3 to buy the game when it first came out when we always get the updates last. Everyone else has had the utopia update for almost 3 weeks GET WITH IT AMAZON!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|We seriously needed another story about a pretty, innocent, incompetent, unthreatening, passive young virgin woman and a rich, powerful man?<br /><br />Grow the f*** up.<br /><br />This book relies on paper-thin characters that are pure stereotypes. BDSM? Pleeeeease. There are ACTUAL good books that explore this lightly, or deeply. This is not one of them.
B0084P9202|3.0|I've been a huge Sigur Ros fan ever since Agaetis Byrjun completely blew my mind. Every album since has seen the band evolving their sound and have all been amazing in their own right as well. Pretty much every one has had to grow on me and take hold slowly as every listen brings new discoveries (like only the best albums tend to). I've been listening to this album for the past week though, and while it's certainly not bad, it just doesn't seem to be up to par with their other albums and is basically just mood music.<br /><br />I love when bands evolve and go off in new directions which Sigur Ros is prone to do, but in this case it just didn't work. This doesn't feel like the work of a full band so much as just a one man experiment. Maybe with time it will grow on me like the rest, but it pains me to say that so far I'm unimpressed with this effort.
0345803485|5.0|This book series was probably one of the best book series that I have read.  I love the story line.  The book is a little racy but overall GREAT!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is an ex-military hero for the South during the civil war. The Indians don't like him, the union forces want him to fight the Indians or else and he is being forced into another conflict that he wants to avoid at all cost. Forced to save a union colonel from the Indians and hide in a cave, he finds the gold mine that he has been looking for. Suddenly he is attacked from behind by a strange looking man with an advanced weapon and he is forced to fight. He kills the man and picks up a glowing medallion and is instantaneously transferred to Mars....<br /><br />This is a Disney Sci-Fi movie and I thought it was excellent. The storyline is well done and the special effects are outstanding. Aliens, monsters and a war on Mars bring John Carter into the battle of his life whether he wants to get involved or not. The real reason he gets involved is the beautiful Princess of Mars (Lynn Collins) that he is attracted to.<br /><br />I did not know what to expect when this DVD came out because of all the bad reviews from the professional critics. Don't believe them and get this movie and judge it for yourself. My wife and I loved it and thought that it was a great movie. Based on the Edgar Rice Burroughs books the script has been changed somewhat but it is still a masterpiece. Disney does its usual fantastic job with the filming and special effects. The movie is nonstop action and adventure and you will lose yourself in the story and characters.<br /><br />Watch this movie and you will enjoy it. It is rated PG 13 but your kids will like it a lot. It is top notch entertainment!
B0086700CM|4.0|well first lets start with the cost. its free! you cant beat that. next it has ok controls that are sometimes bad but most of the time they are good. also the graphics are good, there are many power ups and characters, and many objectives to meet. the only thing I didn't like was it takes too many coins to get characters and sometimes there are places where its impossible to jump across. overall it is a good game and works well on kindle fire
B005LAIGPA|4.0|Andrew Detmet (Dane DeHaan) is the geek everyone picks on, Matt Garetty (Alex Russell) is his cousin and sometimes friend and Steve Montgomery (Michael B. Jordan) is the popular high school jock and politician. How does this unlikely group become best friends and hang out almost every day together. It's simple; they accidently discover a subterranean object that makes then develop the power of gods...<br /><br />What follows is a good movie depicting the life and troubles of three teenagers who slowly become omnipotent. The special effects are well done and the story line is also good. I enjoyed the movie and the acting was not bad at all.<br /><br />I was not so crazy about the found-footage concept that this movie is based on but at least the director had the sense not to film the movie in the violent and eye jerking camera motions of many of the other found-footage movies released in the last few years. There is a little of that but it only happens on occasion and it is not the continuous and nauseating headache style of jerky camera that have seen in the past. This story and plot line was actually good enough that it might have made a better movie if filmed in the normal movie mode.<br /><br />Overall I was surprised at how good this movie was and it was set up to possibly be a sequel. It gives you a look into the life and issues many young people face today and their struggle to handle a gift they didn't ask for.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to you!
B007I2BZIE|3.0|but like most Rush albums since their lyrical/artistic peak in the early 80's, there's multiple extremely forgettable tracks.  The title track is a wonderful production, Headlong Flight is certainly a fun song with multiple Rush \\"throwback\\" sequences throughout.  Other tracks such as The Garden offer up nuggets as well.  However, there are protracted periods of what I would term the Rush drone; the (now) expected series of snoozers that seems to haunt most of Rush's albums over the last decade or so.<br /><br />Teaming with Nick Raskulinecz (Richard Chycki) has certainly moved things in a positive direction after the production disaster that was Vapor Trails about a decade ago (really, what were those guys thinking?), but they're just trying to hard at times at this juncture.  Hardcore Rushites will eat this album up and declare it the greatest Rush album since the last greatest Rush album Snakes and Arrows.  Clockwork Angels will certainly be one the most interesting overall productions in (fringe) mainstream music in 2012, and that will likely garner the album multiple accolades in the critical world where Rush is suddenly \\"cool\\" (and not again, for the first time).
B007K3JCAE|4.0|I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan. I read the abridged adaptation of \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" as a kid and was immediately addicted. I was then introduced to Basil Rathbone's movie version of the sleuth. Over the years, I've read a few of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories and loved them all. Unlike many Sherlockians, I had no problem with Robert Downey Jr. playing the character. I thoroughly enjoyed his unique, physically fit, and active exploits in Guy Ritchie's first \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" film.<br /><br />Upon a second viewing, this is still a great movie. That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws.The only real issue is the beginning of the film, where it feels like Ritchie is trying to frontload it a bit too much. The rest of the movie moves along at a good pace and keeps viewers riveted. Don't try watching this in a noisy room or while doing something else because it's way too complex and you won't be able to keep up.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts and movie fans will be happy with the \\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows\\" Blu-ray / DVD Combo Pack. There's some entertaining extras and a great film with a pristine high definition transfer to make it worth everyone's hard-earned cash. Consumers will no doubt feel they get their money's worth when purchasing.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is a fun game. my 4 year old loves it too! It is really addictive once you get started. I would recommend it to everyone.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|Previously went from original black bumper by apple, to a blue one I purchased on Amazon: [[ASIN:B004E2Z85M Bumper Case for Apple iPhone4 - Bumper with buttons for volume and power - Blue]] and now I'm ready for a new case for my iPhone 4.<br /><br />I'm pro-Amazon, so I thought this would be a great option in the ~$10 range. Quick verdict is that I'm not really a fan. I rated 3 star because it is still a good case for those looking for a simple case.<br /><br />Feel: A bit rubbery. Not as slick as a glossy plastic finish, but less grip than a pencil eraser. I'd say the best way to describe the feel and grip is like the rubber on the moving handrail of an escalator.<br /><br />Protection: No different than that of which others have stated. Very durable and although I never dropped my phone while using this case, I have no doubt that my phone would be safe from any reasonable height. nothing covering the buttons, so water/dust can creep into the buttons.<br /><br />Why I did not like the case:<br /> - Thickness. With the bumper, I was used to the feel of just the phone and a small protective layer around the side. The Amazon case added a significant heft to the back of the phone, making the overall phone a lot larger than I was used to.<br /><br /> - Front border surrounding the screen: Although I liked that the front border raised over the top of the screen, so that the screen would not touch the table if I laid it face-down...I found it to be a bit too thick. The inside border of the front lip encroached too much into the screen. I found it difficult to type the letter \\"q\\" because the case was covering too much of the side of the screen. Never a problem with the bumper, so don't think I can blame it on fat fingers.<br /><br />- Buttons harder to reach: Maybe this is attributed to the thickness of the case, or maybe I'm too used to the old bumper case, but I it hard to click on the volume buttons and the lock button on top. Perhaps I was more used to the augmented buttons that raised over the side of the bumper.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is still a great basic case made by Amazon, but if you're at all concerned for the increased size of your iphone, this is probably not the case for you. Since I'm looking for a different look from the bumper, I'm going to give this low profile type case a test-drive: [[ASIN:B0079VP5JY elago S4 Slim Fit 2 Case for iPhone 4/4S (Soft Feeling Jean Indigo)- ECO PACK]]
0385344228|5.0|This book is great.  It has a surprise ending.  The person I bought it from gives great srvice.  Hope to buy another book from him again.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|...which is saying something, because I really enjoy all of Scalzi's work. There's no question that it's written for Trek fans; if you don't understand/appreciate the redshirt meme to begin with, it may fall a little flat for you. I suppose that calling it fan fiction is actually technically correct but unfair due to the (justifiably) bad rap most fan-fic gets. Just remember that this is fan fiction written by SCALZI.<br /><br />For those who do love the source material, with all of its foibles, it's just tremendous fun. And I mean FUN. I always enjoy and appreciate good science fiction, but it's not that often that I genuinely have FUN reading a book. I don't know any other author that could have pulled this off without having it come to pieces. It's doing the same thing that Galaxy Quest did, only better, in my opinion. Slapping around all of the Trek tropes with glee, but also with a clear love for all of them.<br /><br />Oh, and although the codas are in a different style altogether, they really worked for me. They're like the Scouring of the Shire, a necessary rounding up and tying off to bring things back down to earth.<br /><br />Try it. You won't be sorry.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|A return to form, AND a refreshing new direction...how is that possible?  Every song on \\"Clockwork\\" has some ancestor in an earlier Rush work, but these are more musically robust and fully realized versions of those earlier efforts.  I hate to use the term \\"magnum opus\\" because I assume most Rush fans assume, as I did, that their most glorious work was behind them, but if this is the career capper, it is a brilliant note to end on.<br /><br />I had already listened to Caravan and BU2B ad nauseum before the full album came out today, and had heard Headlong Flight many times in the past few weeks as well, so 'nuff said on those songs.  The rock gems on \\"Clockwork\\" include the complex and accomplished \\"The Anarchist,\\" with exquisite bass work, and \\"The Garden,\\" which is not only musically a masterwork, but contains some of the most deft and intelligent lyrics on the album, including these excellent closing lines:<br /><br />The future disappears into memory<br />With only a moment between<br />Forever dwells in that moment<br />Hope is what remains to be seen<br /><br />While hope might indeed be that which remains to be seen, I can barely hope for anything better from Rush.  I have a ticket to see them in the fall (yes, A ticket--you try getting your girlfriend to go to a Rush concert), and was initially hoping they didn't play too much off of \\"Clockwork\\" to the exclusion of past favorites.  But I've reversed that opinion.  Now I hope they play as much from \\"Clockwork\\" as they want.<br /><br />Final note...I'm a big fan of these lyrics from BU2B2:<br /><br />I was brought up to believe<br />Belief has failed me now<br />The bright glow of optimism<br />Abandoned me somehow<br /><br />Belief has failed me now<br />Life goes from bad to worse<br />No philosophy to console me<br />In a clockwork universe<br /><br />I don't think I should quote more and risk a breach of \\"fair use,\\" but the lyrics go on from there also to end on a hopeful note.  That is the charm of \\"Clockwork Angel,\\" beyond the brilliant muscial artistry: dramatically, it contains a tale of a modest victory of \\"spirit\\" over conditions.  This is a Rush mainstay, and has never been better expressed.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I entered this book with an open mind. Honestly. I was never a twilight fan, but I saw that this was a New York Times Bestseller and thought I would check it out. But the more I read, the more I just couldn't take anymore. I just can't get past how awful the writing is. The main character is just unbelievable and so incredibly flat. Like I just can't believe that a character that says \\"holy Guacamole\\" would ooze understated sex appeal. It's just so cheesy. And unrealistic. Like the way they  talk about sex? It sounds like some strange fan fiction written by a twelve year old that has never experienced sex. I couldn't even finish the book. I think the idea is really great, but the writing is just terrible.

B005LAIHQS|5.0|After the apocalypse of Independence Day and the epics of Star Wars and Star Trek, the sci-fi field was ripe for a spoof. Men in Black was the DEFINITIVE spoof of the sci-fi genre when it came out, an entertaining balance of light-hearted drama, action, and wacky comedy. The sequel...wasn't quite on the same level of film-making, lacking a smart script, and showing just what happens when Sonnenfeld gets carried away with drenching his stars in colored goo. And now act three rolls out and we have...<br /><br />\\"I promised the secrets of the universe, nothing more.\\"<br /><br />After the insanity of the previous two Men in Black movies, everything moves in a different direction this time around...fourth dimensionally. When I heard that this movie would be all about time travel, and when I heard that the script was generated in a huge rush so that they could get the movie out on time, I expected the worst. I was VERY pleasantly surprised this time around. The basic plot revolves around an evil alien who sets out for vengeance on K using time travel to erase him, so that he simultaneously kills his nemesis and sets in motion the destruction of Earth in the present. A simple premise, but the execution of said premise SHINES.<br /><br />\\"Here, take this, and all you have to do is jump.\\"<br /><br />From the get-go this movie has fun with all the old and new sci-fi tropes. J has to time jump by literally jumping off a building (Girl Who Leapt Through Time anyone?) in a great super-cartoony CGI sequence that I'm SURE would have been awesome to see in 3D. When he actually gets to 1969 there's everything from a GIANT neutralizer that doesn't quite look safe, to new gadgets that result in some awesome action sequences (unicycle speeders and rocket packs). And naturally all the typical 1960's stereotypes are toyed and joked with, but in most cases this is very well done, while at the same time giving us subtle clues into the nature of K and his relationships through a new perspective.<br /><br />\\"I am getting too old for this. I can only imagine how YOU feel.\\"<br /><br />It cannot be overstated how PERFECT Josh Brolin is as young K. He manages to be super-serious in that Jack Webb style while simultaneous displaying the same chemistry with Will Smith's agent K. He delivers his lines with perfect comic timing, and gives his character a lot of heart. Will Smith might be sleep-walking through the role, but he's got some GREAT lines this time around, and it's obvious he's having a great time with the role. The rest of the cast likewise does a great job with their roles, and keeps things light-hearted and fun (with only a few dead gags here and there).<br /><br />\\"Do you know what is the most destructive power in the universe?\\" \\"Sugar?\\"<br /><br />This movie is big, bright, and beautiful. It was clearly designed to be viewed in IMAX 3D and it shows. Everything is just so vivid and well-framed, and crystal clear. It really makes a nice change from the very darkly lit and darkly framed films that have been popular the past few years. And as my wife commented to me right after the movie finished, most movies are SUPPOSED to be fun, light, and leave you feeling good when you exit the theater. They are supposed to ENTERTAIN you (at least that's the lesson I got from Sullivan's Travels, your mileage may vary). There's room for every kind of movie, but this kind does what movies were meant to do in the first place. MIBIII is FUN, and it has a lot of heart. The end of the movie really and truly surprised me. The climax of the time travel plot results in a plot revelation that was not only NOT stupid, but actually was heart-warming (giving you a HUGE character development twist on K that I never saw coming). That's just plain good film making. Not to mention awesome little surprises that are purely the result of good writing (an accidental time jump turning the tables on a one-sided fight) and excellent direction.<br /><br />\\"You got some city miles on you.\\"<br /><br />Some people might start watching this movie feeling like I did, that the franchise was really looking like it was running out of gas. I was thrilled to find that MIBIII is now my favorite film the series. It's a great comedy with wonderful comic timing, a great adventure with lots of great action sequences, and its got more character, charm, and heart than anything else in the series yet. I will definitely buy it when it comes out on Blu-Ray and would recommend any fans of the series do the same.ou.\\"<br /><br />Some people might start watching this movie feeling like I did, that the franchise was really looking like it was running out of gas.

B007MDB71O|5.0|A Familiar Story<br /><br />100 years after it was first published Edgar Rice Burroughs' sci-fi epic FINALLY is done justice on the big screen. Under-hyped, over-budget, and helmed by a first-time live-action director most famous for directing CGI animated films for a general audience, John Carter is a sci-fi fantasy adventure triumph, and not only the best film of the summer so far, but the best movie I've seen all year.<br /><br />Anyone who has read the books knows the basic story, and many do even if they haven't. A cavalryman at the end of the American Civil War gets magically transported to Mars where his already formidable fighting skills become super-human thanks to the low gravity of Mars. He gets caught up in a war, rescues a Princess, and saves the day. Anyone who faults the movie for repeating tropes of the past should take a moment to consider something Isaac Asimov once said:\\"There is no such thing as an original idea.\\" Does John Carter feature gladiator arena fights, a princess in distress, all the usual adventure movie themes? Yes it does. Do Star Wars and Avatar and dozens of other movies feature the same themes and tropes? Yes they do. The books written by Edgar Rice Burroughs did it a hundred years ago, but that's not the point. The point is that the movie does it again, but it does it WELL.<br /><br />That Old Saturday Matinee<br /><br />People don't seem to care for movies that cater to the love of the old serials like they used to. When Star Wars came out it ushered in a whole era of fan-boy love for old-school adventure. When Indiana Jones came out it got the same level of excitement boiling in the blood of genre fans. Then Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow came out and everyone seemed to forget what movies were all about as it crashed and burned at the box office. The new Star Wars movies came out and people were so demanding in their expectations that they ceased to enjoy good old-fashioned sci-fi cheese for it's own sake (it's supposed to be fun!). And now here we are with John Carter and the same people are making the same mistakes all over again. John Carter is not a throw-away film. It's the best example of it's genre in a LONG time. It's better than the Star Wars Prequels. It's better than the fourth Indiana Jones (which is under-rated in my opinion). And it's a WHOLE lot better than Marvel's The Avengers.<br /><br />A Tour-De-Force of Wildly Entertaining Cinema<br /><br />This film really does have everything you could possibly want in a summer blockbuster. After I saw it I just couldn't believe it didn't get a July 4th opening, because it deserved to be THE movie of the summer. The film is well-directed, with excellent pacing, timing, and framing. It keeps you watching closely every second, and wastes no time. The photography is beautiful, showing us alien vistas and armies reminiscent of monster films and sword and sandal classics. The fighting is never off-screen, cut-away, or out-of-frame (unlike the horribly directed close-up hand-to-hand fights in the Avengers).<br /><br />The jokes are genuinely and universally funny, viewing after viewing. The writing is sharp and neither overly sparse nor overly wordy. The editing of this film is excellent, yielding a compact, compelling picture that never drags. The CGI is excellent, and even characters that are completely CGI are believable and very human in their emotions and actions (take that JarJar!). There is a bit of a cartoonishness to the CGI, but it simply blends with the world of the movie so well (like Avatar) that I don't mind it at all. The sound effects could win an academy award, and the music DEFINITELY should. John Carter has the most recognizable theme I've heard in a very long time, and the score is dynamic, taking us through all the emotions of joy, sorrow, romantic longing, and heroic triumph.<br /><br />Most importantly, this film has HEART. There is character development, actual PLOT (scheming forces manipulating rulers and others to bring destruction, an internal struggle to let go of the past and fight to create a future). The action sequences are spectacular, but none is so memorable as when our hero has a series of flashbacks to painful past events while fighting endless hordes of green-skinned Martians all alone. I cried during that sequence. That's movie magic.<br /><br />What a Summer Movie Should Be<br /><br />Some people go to movies to see something shocking. Some go to see something dark and edgy. I go to get away from my problems and be reminded that anything is possible. I go to experience a sense of wonder, and most of all, to be entertained. John Carter is a masterpiece of these elements. If you have the right mindset it will make you feel like a kid again. It will let you forget about the world and be magically transported to a far away world. And you will be VERY entertained.<br /><br />John Carter is unapologetic escapist fantasy. Most good things in life are. The only flaw that I can think of is that the film SHOULD have been called John Carter of Mars (as it is on the End Title). Maybe then more people would have seen it. I saw it twice in the theater and only wish I could have seen it a few more times. Don't rent this movie. Buy it. On Blu-ray.

B004JMSIRC|5.0|Bought the movie for my 5 year old grandson he was so excited. He watches it so much and each time he watches it you would think it was his first time
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book began to gain a lot of steam, and curiosity got the best of me, and I am a fan of good erotica, so I thought I might really enjoy this!<br /><br />Yeah, that didn't happen.<br /><br />What I didn't know and wish I had known before I picked up this book: That it was based off of Twilight. And trust me the realization that this was meant to be Twilight fanfiction was EASY to spot in this book. The only thing that was really changed was jobs, careers, names, places. Ana = Bella and Christian = Edward<br /><br />First off my biggest complaint with this book is the fact that it read just like a fifteen-year-old girl writing fanfiction. It really was the worst thing I have ever read. Not a huge fan of Stephenie Meyer's writing style either, this made Stephenie's style look like a masterpiece. I'm kinda a stickler for finishing things I do buy so I plowed through this book quite slowly and with a lot effort.<br /><br />But next to the bad writing there was ZERO PLOT. The plot was pretty much over before the book ever really got started. Then we got sex, sex, and more sex. I personally can't even imagine what happens in the other two books, nor do I want to find out!<br /><br />Again, I like Erotica, but nothing about this book was likeable, and the erotica was just uncomfortable. It was just too badly written.<br /><br />I know I'm one of the few negative reviews of this book and so be it. I'm glad if people do enjoy it, but it really wasn't for me.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Everything works fluently except the glu coins. I keep earning them but it still displays 0? Other than that it is a cult favorite anyone can play enjoy and hopefully find humor in.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a pretty fun app to play. some games are pretty challenging and some are very easy as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and have been looking for an app on my favorite appstore, amazon appstore for android. I LOVE  IT!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are a wide range of games that are easy to understand,  fun to play.  I am very pleased with this download.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game and I was so happy that it was finally on the kindle but the more u play it the more choppy it gets. I would recemend this game but don't over play it
B0063IH60K|1.0|i love solitaire. i was happy to find it. the kittens are cute pictures for the card backs. i also like that you could use your own photos too.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love it woo much I have it on my ipad. iphone ipod etc.  I libebit it is so addicting
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game. It gets frustrating when it asks for money. If it is free you should get it.
B001TH8UUA|4.0|These work fine for TV-DVD and Monitor-PC use.  I don't use 3D, nor am I a true Audiophile, but they seem more than adequate for general use.  The length is good.  The only downside is that the plastic around the connections are fairly large, making it hard to work with in tight spaces.
B0042X9L6A|3.0|This flash does not adequately meet my shooting style.i shoot for media and i have no more that 6 persons in a photo and the light emitts from this flash  doesnt cover my 17-70 or 10-24mm.<br />i have tried using the selector switch for single,double or group and the light is very weak.<br />I find the SB 600 more powerful or the SB 800,if you can find one.SB700 is a nice entry level flash for similar type of cameras
B00555X8OA|4.0|Good book, especially if you like the psychology/economics genre that seems to be popular lately (tipping point, freakonomics...).  There are some very interesting studies inside that are both interesting and kinda shocking.
B001BTG3OQ|4.0|Having purchase this flash now couple months now,i must say i'm quite please with it but not happy.It has great illumination and takes care of your everyday shooting.A little hot to lighter skin persons when using automatic. better results  when you use the manual mode and make  your setting.Even when you bounce from roof or turn flash upwards it can be problematic for lighter skin person  when your close to 3ft-5ft. Go get it,but watch for the overheating problem.Thermal shut down
B005LAII0I|1.0|Not funny. Not a good plot. Julia Roberts is an amazing actress but does not make a good witch. Prince Charming or whoever he is in the movie gets on a person's nerves acting like a dog and stuff. Just overall, a bad twist on Snow White.
B007N31ZBU|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2012 UK BLU RAY 'COLLECTOR'S SERIES' BOOK PACK VERSION ***<br /><br />In April 2012 Universal Studios was 100 years old - and to celebrate that movie-making centenary - they've had 13 of their most-celebrated films fully restored for BLU RAY. But it doesn't stop there. As many as 80 other titles will be given US re-launches across the year each featuring distinctive \\"100th Anniversary\\" gatefold card-wrap packaging - and in some cases a host of new features. 1973's \\"The Sting\\" is one of the thirteen singled out for full restoration (see list below) - and like the other BLU RAYS in this series so far - is very tastefully done.<br /><br />Released 5 June 2012 (11 June 2012 in the UK) - \\"The Sting Collector's Series\\" comes in a gorgeous limited edition 40-page 'Book Pack' (Barcode 5050582893151). The outer hardback holder has an awkward card wrapped around it which is attached at the front with a flimsy circular sticker - not the most eloquent of objects it has to be said and it contains info that isn't on the back sleeve of the book pack - so you don't want to lose it. It's hard to keep in place without damage - so I put the whole shebang in a plastic sleeve for protection. It's also worth noting that most of the AMERICAN issues are 'two-disc' sets containing the BLU RAY, the DVD and also means to obtain a Digital Copy via download. It appears that the UK issues will contain ONLY the BLU RAY in the Book Pack. However, if you want say \\"Out Of Africa\\" or \\"Buck Privates\\" (which have yet to be given UK releases) - then the US issues will do because their non-region coding will allow them play in all machines.<br /><br />PICTURE QUALIUTY:<br />Digitally remastered and Fully Restored from Original Film Elements - Universal are reputed to have stumped-up over $300,000 for the restoration - and the results are wonderful for about to 90 to 95% of the time. The opening four minutes will worry fans because the definition is slightly hazy - but once past that - there is a steady stream of moments that are truly breathtaking throughout the duration. Filmed largely on sets on the Universal lot - the quality lighting is consistent throughout even in those difficult and darkly lit night sequences. There is (it has to be said) slight blocking and grain at some points - but mostly you're enjoying the overall sparkle of the print too much to notice.<br /><br />And because it's uber clean - it accentuates so much. We finally get to see the immaculate costumes and suits of the legendary EDITH HEAD (ties, shirts, hats, overcoats). Then there's the awesome sparkle of Paul Newman's famous blue eyes and Robert Redford looking so handsome in every shot that you just want to hit him! The clarity continues right through the plot cards to the closing credits - which are so clean it could have been done yesterday. The transfer is not all perfect by any means - but at times - this is as beautiful and as filmic as I've ever seen. The audio is crisp and clear too.<br /><br />FILM ITSELF:<br />You also forget why it received 10 Oscar nominations and won seven - including Best Picture. Everything about \\"The Sting\\" works - the charisma of the three principal leads - Paul Newman as Henry Gondorff the master of the 'big con', Robert Redford as the reckless and wild small-time hustler Johnny Hooker and Robert Shaw as the vicious and egotistical Chicago mobster Doyle Lonnegan. Then there's the fantastic ensemble cast - Charles Durning as the corrupt Lt. Snyder, Eileen Brennan as the madam Billie who runs a bordello over an amusement arcade and Harold Gould as the dapper Kid Twist who hires the crew that will bring down Lonnegan on a racetrack scam (he wants the crew to be \\"The Quill...\\" which is Grifter-speak for the best). Aiding Gondorff in this endeavour is Jack Kehoe as Eric The Kid - a small-time Grifter who wants revenge for a friend's death at the hands of the mobster Donegan, Ray Walston as J.J. Singleton who helps in the poker game scam and reads out the wire in the bogus betting parlour, John Heffernan who quits his dreary bank job in a heartbeat to join Gondorff's crew as a teller and Dana Elcar as the supposed FBI agent. You may even recognize the dulcet tones of Robert Earl Jones as Harvey the Grifter at the beginning of the movie who gets killed - his son is James Earl Jones - the voice of Darth Vader in Star Wars. The other big ingredient of course is the superlative and evocative film score by Marvin Hamlisch that brilliantly reintroduced Scott Joplin's ragtime music to the world.<br /><br />BOOKLET:<br />The 40-page booklet is pure eye candy as you can imagine. It opens with a 2-page appreciation by film-critic and historian Leonard Maltin, a pictorial actor/character \\"The Players\\" list, 2-page spreads on Newman, Redford, Shaw and George Roy Hill, reproductions of the script, Edith Head's design drawings, Advert campaigns, a piece on the composer Marvin Hamlisch and the music, Oscar nominations, telegrams of congratulations etc. Lovely to look at...<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br />Having directed Redford and Newman in \\"Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid\\" - GEORGE ROY HILL was the Director of choice for \\"The Sting\\". His almost army-like style is discussed in the pleasingly long and detailed principal extra \\"The Art Of The Sting\\" which is divided into 3-parts. He was clearly admired by the actors who trusted his vision (he won the Oscar for Best Director) - it's just such a shame there's no interview with him to illuminate the proceedings. It's also clear that both Redford and Newman who mention each other in the present tense were filmed just prior to Newman's sad passing in 2008. Charles Durning and newcomer Dimitra Arliss give telling and superb recollections of the shoot (how Shaw got his limp) - and both speak highly of the three principals - and the sheer 'fun' it was making the film. They also quite rightly keep referring to David Ward's almost 'perfect' script - which he'd worked on for a whole year.<br /><br />To sum up - I've loved re-watching this timeless caper movie in such top-notch quality. And it's heartening to see Universal Studios finally throw some proper money at the preservation of their movie legacy - and be proud about doing so too. I'm collecting the whole series - and live in hope that other studios respect their past in the same glorious way.<br /><br />In 2013 \\"The Sting\\" will be 40 years old and has (not surprisingly) stood the test of time.<br />This 2012 BLU RAY is a lovely reissue of it - and for fans of this glorious Americana piece - a must buy.<br /><br />BLU RAY Specifications:<br />EXTRAS:<br />1.

B000WC4A8O|5.0|What an awesome purchase this was.  Everything down to the packaging was top notch.  The albums themselves sound unbelievable.  If you're a Led Zeppelin fan, and own a turntable, this is a must own.  If you don't own a turntable, get one, and make this your first album purchase.  I love vinyl, and love Led Zeppelin, so I'm ecstatic about this purchase.  Thanks amazon for making it so quick and easy to get.
B006RUJST6|1.0|I won't spoil this book for those of you that may like to read this book.  I can just say, I enjoyed reading it until I got close to the end.  One part in this book made me think this authors mind is warped and depraved.  For that reason one book in this series was enough for me, I don't care about reading the others.
B007JRTSVE|1.0|Bad and boring.  It was torture to watch it as an adult, but even the kids (who loved the original Happy Feet) couldn't stay with the movie.  Not funny, bad script, overdone - and the music was even worse.<br /><br />save yourself!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|nice fun game i like to play mahjong and this game is good on small or large phones very nice
B004MC8CA2|5.0|wonderful! I love the text to voice feature. great way to fall asleep at night! thanks for creating this beautiful app!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Very easy to use. Complete information presented in a concise and readable format. Have found the information to be up to date and accurate.
B0001RVTXO|4.0|A lot of the great tracks are on here. But too many are not great, so I only gave it 4 stars.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This is their absolute best album since 'Moving Pictures'. I honestly did not think Rush still had it in them to produce a nearly flawless album.
0345803485|5.0|The idea of a naive college graduate who's a virgin meeting up with a controlling, charismatic, perverted Dominate leaves the story wide open for a multitude of directions.I like the direction it's going by the end as she's gaining courage and knows her limits while Mr Grey seems to be loostening up those bonds as he becomes possessed with this unexperienced and very bright young lady.
B0086700CM|5.0|When I downloaded this game,  I thought it was something else. But since I have downloaded it, I have not been able to stop.  Stayed up most of the night. Love it. now only if I can figure out where the wallpaper went.
B007ZRZF8I|4.0|its fun and very fast paced. you can really get lost playing this game. the challenge is definitely there. always getting harder. I recommend this game.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|i am not a reader and this book kept me intriqued and wanting to read. i am trying to figure out what book i want to read next.  suggestions are welcomed.
030758836X|1.0|Purchased this book based on the great reviews.  I read half of this book and it was boring. I tried...
B0086700CM|5.0|the game is awesome. its a great game because if your bored you can just play.very challenging. calms your boredom.
B007L5KT76|5.0|Sherlock Holmes the first movie was really good, kept me guessing and trying to figure everything out while still making me laugh. Now in the second movie, it's so much better. You never expect things that happen and the humor is better than every. Plus, Robert Downey Jr. is super hot!!! SWOON! But yeah, good movie, and you'll enjoy all the surprises and jumps and laughter. You'll never see it coming(:
B00785P2QC|4.0|Game is entertaining and a good way to spend any time that you are bored. I'd recommend it to a friend. /

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game gives kids a chance to share with the less fourtunate then them. It is a great game and everyone should have it.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is so much fun running from crazy monkey things! I love the choices of the people. Honestly the japenese girl is my favorite!
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|After hearing some negative things about this movie I finally decided to check it out for myslef. I was more than pleasantly surprised. First of all, Liam Neeson was absolutely brilliant. All of the acting in this movie was superb. The score was perfect. The cinematography was gorgeous as well.<br /><br />This is not an action movie about wolves. This is a story about choosing how you die and how that reflects the way you chose to live. This is a story about love and brotherhood and fear and survival. Perhaps, it's even about violating nature and the karmic consequences of our abuses. If you're expecting something cliche then you might be disappointed, but if you're open minded you just might love it. We're all going to die one day. How will you live now? How will you face death when it comes for you?<br /><br />Enjoy
B0074VTHKM|2.0|The story is fairly weak and not all that well done.  The promo blurbs all suggest it is a follow on to the murder in the first Boone book, but references to the original murder add almost nothing other than a few pages to the book's fairly short length.  Every element of the story is telegraphed well in advance so there is very little suspense.  A very weak effort by Grisham.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|You will not regret reading or buying this book! It has aspects that are relatable to everyone as well as things to learn. You feel as though Charlie is writing to you and his character and story will touch your heart. I really enjoyed this book- new favorite. :)
1936608898|5.0|Dallas and Melissa Hartwig, creators of Whole 9 and friends of CrossFit Albuquerque, have written and just released a new gem of a book.  It Starts With Food, is a witty, informational, instructional, fun, and pointed book.  IT WILL ALSO CHANGE YOUR LIFE.  If you haven't stepped up to trying the Whole 30, this is the book that will make you take the plunge.  They do an excellent job of explaining why you should change your eating habits...and change them now.  The science and explanations are credible, yet easily digestible for everyone.  They don't beat around the bush, yet acknowledge what we all know and think: this is HARD, but doable.  Yet, the book is written such that you put it down wanting to change your food and your life immediately.  The change part is in the book, in plain English for your taking.  It Starts With Food includes the Whole 30 program which is your road map for the first 30 days of the rest of your life.  Then and most importantly it leads past those first 30 days to life long healthy eating habits.  This is NOT a diet book.  This is a fun, tasty, yet healthy way to live all packaged into a book that is hard to put down.  Of all the nutrition books on my shelf, this is the book that I would recommend first.
0439023521|5.0|I would have skiped over this book if a friend didn't recommend it to me. I was under the impression it was another kids book like Twilight but I was thoroughly surprised it had me hooked and I couldn't stop reading. If you saw the movie and didn't like it the book is a lot better the movie didn't do justice to how harsh it was to survive and glossed over a lot but that's how most movies are seeing how they needed it to be pg-13 for its target demographic. over all a great book.
B001NLL93W|4.0|i really enjoyed reading the mortal instruments series. i recommend it for anyone who enjoys comedy adventure and romance. though i think young adults would enjoy these books the most.:)
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|This movie just left me in awe.  Beautiful and heaartbreaking and powerful.  This is something that everyone should see, but it is too upsetting to watch this often so I gave it 4 stars.  Really powerful, worth seeing and not at all a waste of time.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I don't like it it wont open my angry birds when I go to click open I uninstalled it but instead of saying install it says open
B0086700CM|5.0|Oh my gosh i love temple run!!! I am SOOOOOOOOOO happy that you can get it on kindle fire now!!! I've played it on friend's  ipods, and i got it for my kindle the second i saw it!!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I like it. Good concept and graphics. It's just the controls lag. Maybe it's my phone. I have the htc hero. Overall,  I give it a good rating.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|good game lots of fun puzzles were interesting and fun. would buy it again. was not sure if i would enjoy tbe game as an adult, but it was very good.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I like to try the new \\"independent\\" authors.  Every once in awhile you find something exceptional.  Not only was the story engaging, but the book was well written and polished.  Take a chance.  You'll be glad.
B0086700CM|5.0|aside from the large screen being a little awkward this game is perfect. the game starts easy but gets slightly more challenging as you move on
B000FCKGPC|2.0|This was certainly my least favorite book. Martin obviously doesn't know how to edit himself. He seems to feel the need to fully develop every thought or idea that comes into his head. He is an incredible writer but certainly has a problem with resolve. This book is soley focused on what i think are the less interesting characters. I would either skip this book or skim through it as much as possible. The fifth book is so much better! I can not wait for the next book. Martin better hold true to his word and finish this series in seven books.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded this game for my daughter but I play it more than she does. its a great way to kill time
0345803485|5.0|this book is awesome!could not put it down and cannot wait to read the other two! well written and fun!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I watch this movie over and over again it's just a very cute heart warming movie.  Great actors and actresses who portray the animated characters.  Would recommend this movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|I swear I have heart palpatations when the apes scream. I LOVE IT. When I think it's a boring evening...I play this game!
B0063IH60K|4.0|this app doesn't have much for bells and whistles but its an easy play.  simple format and standard moves make it easy to operate. random deals ensure you don't have a winning hand every single time. sadly its a bit boring at times but such is the game.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I like this game it actes alot like the real thing. Having several different layouts to plya is a great fecture.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I encourage everyone to get this app its very relaxing. This is one game I can honestly say.. when wiretap gets to nagging it comes a live lol.. but really get this app its worth your time.. It does great on my kindle fire..
B0088RQ4X4|2.0|I rented this movie based on all the good reviews here on Amazon.com. I am so sorry I wasted my money!<br /><br />Not only was the acting laughable, but the director and editor of this piece of junk should be banned from Hollywood for the rest of eternity. The script had lots of potential - handsome, rebel Earthling falls for the beautiful and smart Princess whose father wants her to marry the baddest, meanest warrior on Mars. Throw in some wise and friendly desert creatures who take in the Earthling and band with him to overthrow the warrior and you've got the makings of a decent film. Or so you should. Not so with John Carter. Somehow Disney managed to ruin what should have been a hit.<br /><br />How did it get to be a dull and amateurish (and did I say too long) movie? The director or editor had no idea how to smoothly transition from a comedic scene to a suspenseful one. And while the movie had good actors in it, the lines were horribly flat and there was no chemistry between Taylor Kitsch (John Carter) and Lynn Collins (Princess Thoris). And the native \\"monsters\\" in the film were hokey.<br /><br />I love sci-fi and fantasy movies but this was barely worth 2 stars. Don't waste your time or money.
0385751532|2.0|The concept for this book is fascinating, but the author doesn't use language in a particularly interesting way.  The writing is filled with clumsy exposition and tedious description.  It's nice that the central charcter is naive, but that's taken way over the top to the point of implausible.  I also found it annoying that the little pieces of wordplay the author must have thought were very clever because he repeats them ad nauseum don't make any sense given that the characters in the book spoke German as a first language.  (Really?  A German nine-year old child living in the early 1940's doesn't know the word \\"fuhrer\\"?  Come on.)
B005L38QK2|4.0|I purchased this gaming mouse with my new gaming laptop and its decent.  I like the design and the pulsing effect but as everyone else noted, the price is a little bit high for a mouse.  Overall however, I do like it better then my Logitech mouse on my main PC.<br /><br />update 4/29/13.  the mouse just stopped working.  moving the mouse around makes the pointer jiggle but thats about it.  checked the laser and it seems clean.  will try their support and update review.  purchased the mouse on 5/25/12.
0345803485|5.0|I loved the book....it's underlying story is a love story and I'm a romantic.  I was a little disappointed in the ending until I realized it was a trilogy.  I have the other two books on order now.  I really liked this book a lot...I was reading it anywhere and everytime I could...including stop lights.  I highly recommend it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book gave an uncensored look into the lives of plantation slave. It kept me up at night reading for hours on end. It moved me in ways I hope to never forget!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|no issues with editing docs. like fave docs path saving. would like to see Skydrive added to cloud storage options.
B0086700CM|5.0|its fun. I like it alot. I'm just trying to reach the end before Im 40. it will keep your attention
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so cute!! I love this game, by far the neatest little city building, farming on mobile I have played. I highly recommend it to those of you who enjoy this genre. Very addictive :)
0345803485|3.0|Okay so I bought this book because the media was always talking about how raunchy and erotic it was... So naturally I had to buy it.  I liked the book and I read all three of them but I've read better.<br />It starts off slow but I figured that she was just character building making you connect with Ana and Christian since you have 2 more books to go. And so when they finally get to the good stuff I was a little disappointed.<br />First things first this author had me questioning if I knew my geography, I'm a 24 year old  american woman and I dont talk like her characters actually no one I know talks the way they do (and I graduated college and met people from all walks of life). I think this would be more believable if the characters were older and lived in England ... Secondly if the writer is going to write erotica you would think she wouldnt be embarrassed to say vagina or all words that related to it. Thirdly this book is based on Christian's BDMS life style and they mention all this equipment but they only use like 4 of them and I'm including the tie in that number  :-(  Everything else that bothered me were small things like Ana wearing the same dress 3 times in a week and the book should have stretched the days out more this book from the time she meets Christian until the book ends is over the course of 2 1/2 weeks and the second book is about the same time you would think that people with there kind of issues would move slower but what ever floats your boat.<br />I think it depends on what you like and your level erotica
B001I45UFC|4.0|This book is great for kids to read from about Grade 3 and above.  It can also be read to younger children.  After reading the book watching one of the Narnia movies and comparing the two is a great comprehension activity.  It can also be used as a vocabulary comparison between the British English and the American English.
1433502410|5.0|I have heard about the ESV, but was reluctant to leave my safe NIV, which I still love.  The ESV Study Bible is fantastic!  I LOVE it!  The introductions to the books are fantastic!  I love the literal translation.  It is far more 'readable' than the NAASB (which I also enjoy)<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Colors and graphics are nice. Hopefully it's longer than some other Alawar games. But then again, I guess 99 cents is a steal.
B005LAIGPU|1.0|Terrible, poorly made movie. I absolutely hated every character except the black guy. It's a shallow teen movie. I'm really shocked that these sorts of films haven't been banned. So in order to be a successful teenager, you need to drink and have sex at parties? Nice message. I was hoping the film would explore subjects like how people with superpowers would deal with it, but that was wishful thinking. The story needed to be much deeper than this. Where is the US government? Other governments? One of the characters does turn evil, but the way it's done is quite poor. He was bullied, gets a mean scowl on his face and starts destroying buildings. That's it?<br /><br />This is not a movie for people who have been in the working world for a few years. It's great for teenagers, but it's a ridiculous movie that gets really pretentious and silly at the very end. It's a movie written from the perspective of a person that grew up in a well-off area, living a shallow party lifestyle, and it's fairly obvious. While there are some great special effects, it's the kind of movie that most people imagine they could do a far better job with if they were in charge.
B00881VLCE|4.0|nice interface. easy to use. nice to have a number of difficulty levels. needs more puzzle options to start. the basic ones are uber cutesy
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Remember now, in the United States of America, Alaska, if your plane crashes, no one will try to look for it! How far away was the nearest search and rescue unit? It couldn't have been far. Given that this is 2012, and not 1837, I'm pretty sure the wreck would have been found quickly and helicopters would have been searching for survivors. I've heard that the wolf attacks were unrealistic. No one even bothered to carry weapons around! Really? Everyone just died one after the other, right on cue. Very depressing movie. It didn't even make any sense why Liam Neeson's character was so suicidal.<br /><br />I had to love the glaring errors in this film. Liam has a rifle but has shotgun shells? Really? Who doesn't know rifles don't use shotgun shells? Then the morons are drinking alcohol in the freezing weather, which is a great way to die in a situation like that. Who wrote this movie?<br /><br />If these sorts of movies are appealing to you, watch The Descent. It handled this subject matter more believably. The Grey is terrible. Skip it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games from easy to fairly hard. my 4 year old loves it asnmuch as I do! give it a try you will be pleasently surprised as I was
B004V5QWU2|5.0|really relaxing and helps me fall asleep! I have to sleep with noise on, and music distracts me sometimes and makes it harder to fall asleep. but this app is really nice and relaxing and soothing. not distracting at all. love it! C:
B0086700CM|5.0|I find it challenging so its a great game to play, yet it gets frustrating,  it makes you want to continue playing and having fun...  ;)
B00846REIS|5.0|I had been putting this one off for a while and I am glad I finally got too it!  What is it with an emotionally screwed a man that is rich and powerful that makes you just love him all the more?  Well I can't wait for the next book I am hooked!!!!
0671027344|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I just had to read it again before the movie comes out in September. I received the book in perfect condition.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|This Snow white movie is so full of violence, blood and gore that it should be rated R, instead of PG-13, I was shocked when I saw the movie and realized that it was rated PG-13. this movie is also filled with a lot of flaws and is even a lot more worse than Wrath Of The Titans.<br />The actors and actresses are very bad, Snow white's skin isn't even white, her lips are not red, and she's not pretty. So whenever the mirror on the wall say's \\"Snow white is the fairest of them all\\" it is lying...<br />I don't like the evil queen, she is very scary, because there were scenes of her eating a dead bird's heart (very graphical blood), and she kills people constantly (which drove me insane). And they also show a scene where the queen has sex with the king! Now that's where the whole movie was ruined, now I am not against sex but small children may not understand sex because they are still innocent..<br />The only normal human being in the movie was Chris hemsworth the huntsman.<br />The special effects were very beautiful, but the ugly and disgusting little white fairy scene was very disturbing, because they came out of a birds belly, and they looked like aliens rather than fairies. (I am 11 years old and I was scared, when I saw the trailer of the movie I had no idea that it was going to be like a horror film).<br />The movie was also depressing, the scenes of the movie went like there was peace in 2 minutes, and then 10 minutes of killing and witchcraft, and on and on it goes till you get confused and not knowing what's going on.<br />The dwarf's were cute, one of them named Gus, dances with snow white and hugs her which made me smile, and then he's killed (this was so sad I almost cried, and children will be very sad and depressed by this scene).<br />There are lot's of horror-movie like scenes.<br />That's all of my opinions, there are more but I don't want to talk about this nightmare-satanism movie anymore..<br />And if you ask me this movie is a disaster, I am glad we only spent 5$ on the garbage.<br />I don't recommend this movie to children, you'd have to be 17 to be able to enjoy this junk.we only spent 5$ on the garbage.<br />I don't recommend this movie to children, you'd have to be 17 to be able to enjoy this junk.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is a very entertaining game. love it. so so so so much!!!!  it will be a good game.  a little hard when first starting.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|What a  movie.  It was great! All action. Truly opens up your eyes to what our Seals do everyday to make sure we are safe as Americans. They sacrifice so much. To all the troops Thank you for your service. My father served, and there is no greater honor than serving ones country.
0061743526|3.0|I expected this book to be of good quality considering it's a special edition. Honestly, I think I was sold a defective reject. The pages appear tattered because they were not trimmed to an even depth. I collect books; this one will not make it into my collection.  To Kill A Mockingbird, however, is a fabulous classic.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this is a very fun game and at first you hate it but than you get addicted to it so give it some time
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have to say I'm am definitely not a big fan of solitaire but after playing that I realized how cool it was. its a great game :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|a nice n calm game. fun if you just need some time to think over things. yep i love it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not only is this book, and its sequels, poorly written, they are entirely vanilla portrayals of bdsm.  It is obvious the writer has never truly experienced any of what she writes about as she is unable to convey the experience with any sense of realism whatsoever.  The reason this series is popular is because it \\"vanilla's down\\" bdsm so that it will appeal to the mass market, i.e. readers can be titillated by something they think is very risque despite that it is in no way representative.  This is nothing more than a poorly written romance novel!
B004UXUUDA|5.0|This is very good movie. The little French actress plays little Sarah is fabulous! Of course, Kristin Scott Thomas is always good. It is worth to buy the dvd and watch it once awhile.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome its highly addictive and supper fun i recomend this game to anyone looking for a blast and has nothing to do.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Although I read many of the Tarzan books and found them exciting and far superior to the movies I have never read a John Carter book even though I'm a dedicated science-fiction fan. I've referred to this as a fantasy movie rather than a science fiction movie as simply a personal call based upon my impressions of the movie.<br /><br />I did not see it in theaters nor did I see any of the trailers referenced in other reviews so I essentially watched it for the first time free of any prejudice. The first time I watched the 2-D version as my wife is uncomfortable with the glasses. On that viewing I thought it was an impressive action movie and provided a fine evening's entertainment. The video and sound is impressive and the dialogue is usually understandable.<br /><br />The second time I watched it in 3-D and had a really good time with the movie. The 3-D effect is good and I discovered that familiarity with the movie enabled me to enjoy it more and I just had more fun with the story, the video quality, the sound and the special effects. This was a gratifying experience and I'm glad I've got the 3-D version.<br /><br />True to the Disney standard it is free of bad language and sexual overtones and is suitable for most audiences. I found it a very enjoyable movie experience and recommend it highly.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think telmpol run is fun on the kinddle fire because it is a lot bigger and more ditaled so u should get it
B0086700CM|5.0|This is my most favorite game :) AND its free!!! I would recommend this app to ANYONE!!!! Defiantly just get it because you could always delete it if you just hated it. But I highly doubt you would!  :)
B005LAIHY0|1.0|I wish I was on the drugs that the people who loved this movie and said it answered all their questions were on.<br /><br />This movie really answered nothing. Though I'm not sure it was supposed to. Having said that, anyone that tries to say that \\"this is not a prequel\\" or \\"this has NOTHING to do with the original Alien movie\\" are dumber than a box of rocks.<br /><br />But that's not even my problem. The writing was aimless and awful. The \\"big scenes\\" were discarded like a used tissue. Like the C-section scene and the betrayal that led to that scene were all but forgotten with a \\"sorry about that\\". The only thing that reminded you that happened was that Shaw kept having a tummy ache, but somehow survived.<br /><br />The stupidity of the crew seeing a missing team member show up with a new monster, hairy face and \\"sitting\\" outside in an awesome, alien yoga pose was unbelievable. They just stood there looking dumbfounded before they were, justifiably, killed. What was the point of that scene anyway?<br /><br />David's directive was hinted at but then discarded, even though Fassbender was great in the role. Vickers (Theron) was the biggest waste in this movie. Her anger, fear and motivation are never, ever explored. She is completely useless in this movie. She just screwed the ship's captain so... that's... good.<br /><br />The more I think about it, the more I hate the movie. Just total garbage.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found Mockingjay, the final book of the hunger games to be less interesting than the others.  Firstly, almost all the main characters go crazy. There's also an unsatisfying ending that concludes abruptly. I would have preferred to know how the government worked after the revolution and what happens to the different characters.  The first two books were written well and had original ideas. The last book was written well but it doesn't catch the readers attention as much. All in all, Mockingjay did not live up to my expectations and did not live up to the first two books but is still worth reading.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|pretty fun game. keeps me entertained when I have nothing better to do. Reminds me of super Mario brothers but I'm pretty sure that's the point.
0979660742|1.0|It is so short book and It is not valuable. I advice other people to look over it before buying it.
0345803485|5.0|This book is amazing!  I finished it in one weekend and am exciting to read the other two books.  I definitely recommend this for the summer for good beach reading!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I heard a lot of people commenting about how it is kind of a continuation of the Twilight trilogy and a lot of the people that like Twilight would also like this book and not be able to put this book down.  I have forced myself to read half of the book and this is the first book I have ever started to read and can't even force myself to finish it.  I don't know how the author can even get away with using so many of the ideas that went into writing the Twilight trilogy.  She is just making money off of someone elses idea and changing some things around (none of them good).  I have never written a review before but I just needed to vent.  A clumsy girl with and old car that her boyfriend doesn't approve of, a younger friend (boy) that wants to be more than friends and is also her mechanic, a mother that just got remarried and can't come to her graduation because her new husband got injured, is just too much similarities to Twilight.  If this woman wants to be a writer, she really needs to come up with her own ideas and not copy from others.
B003IDMUVI|4.0|Usual John Grisham story - young lawyer takes on big business, case goes to court, pyrrhic victory. Unusual twist in that a love interest is introduced, however doesn't seem that the author quite knows where this is going.<br />Having said that, as with most Grisham books, don't start reading this late at night - you won't be able to put it down!
B007ADIRDM|4.0|My granddaughter really wanted this Monster High playset with a doll, and she was thrilled to get it.  I do feel, however, it was overpriced, and I wished I had researched the product more before my purchase.  Overall, she is happy so I guess that is all that matters.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|This album is amazing and more like Begin to Hope versus Far, which I had hardly any use fore.<br />It has the pop edge of her usual songs.  None of the songs are bad on the album.  Favorite because of the neat lyrics is All the Rowboats.<br />It is a definite buy/ download.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Can't send files or save any files uploaded from goggle docs. Pointless app if I can only save it on the Kindle. One file keeps giving me an error message and to click report. I click report and it States that there is nowhere to report it. Asking for a refund on this one if they don't respond to my customer support request by tomorrow.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down. A twist on the fairytale. I read the complete trilogy in less than a week.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|IMO, the books are horrendous: poorly written, sophomoric, and terribly redundant! Complete waste of time and money, and way over-hyped by the media! A 13-year-old junior high school student could have done a better job writing about their \\"sex-capades\\" in their diary! This author should NEVER be allowed to publish again; she probably can't even write a decent grocery list!
B0086700CM|5.0|game provides joy to all ive played this game all day and until ky kindle died this game is simply amazing
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I don't know why this keeps saying it's only compatible for my Droid X and NOT for my Samsung Galaxy Tab which runs on an Android system. I was so excited getting my Galaxy tab because I thought it meant that I could now read my graphic novel from one of my favorite horror series: Walking Dead but the comic and the \\"Kindle for Android\\" is only compatible with my Droid X phone. I cannot read a comic on this as it is really small text and hard to read. Although I've already got Kindle installed on my tablet as well, I don't get any option for downloading the comic to it.<br /><br />UPDATE to my review above. Kindle is AWESOME on my Samsung Galaxy Tablet now. With all the latest updates, I have been very happily reading my Walking Dead comic books and graphic novels purchased and downloaded through kindle to my tablet. update to 4 stars from 1...4 because there's always room for improvement but they listened and made a MASSIVE IMPROVEMENT on the app from months ago.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is sooo super awesome and addictive! i love it! get it its amazing \(&bull;_&bull;\) to the window (/&bull;_&bull;)/ to the wall!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|My 6 year old daughter absolutely loves this game. The controls are easy to figure out and she plays it over and over again on her kindle fire. I also have it downloaded on my phone and I get addicted playing it too. Just like Mario from the good old days!
B00005QCYD|5.0|We've all seen it. We all loved it. The entire Jurassic Park trilogy is great!  I ordered all 3 for not only myself but for my three children. It's not easy finding movies that aren't animated and are still suitable and entertaining.  Well this is a winner. My kids love them all.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|This is a mediocre shooter to play if you're got a Galaxian itch to scratch, but that is about all the good I have to say.<br /><br />Unfortunately this game suffers from poor design that create unwinnable situations for the player. Progress through the game is more reliant on luck than actual player skill.<br /><br />Notable examples of this are:<br /><br />Asteroid fields that can pin a player down with asteroids that far exceed your ships ability to destroy.<br /><br />Enemies attack patterns that hug the lower sixth of the play field while shooting, bypassing any shields you may have, and forcing the player to largely avoid those areas. It wouldn't be so bad if they all didn't stay at that low altitude.<br /><br />And finally bosses that can literally shoot sideways, with no way for the player to counter.<br /><br />Ultimately, the game is pretty to look at, but not much else.
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|I remember the words well from a friend who had seen the Hannabel Lector movies: \\"Interesting...but I'm not sure you want this in your head.\\" Don't get me wrong - Cheryl is a good writer, but her subjects are disturbing. This is not so much a book about hiking the PCT as it is her own catharsis: her father brutalizing her and her family, the death of her mother, her herion addition, and the final straw for me: the graphic murder of a beloved horse (it made me ill). And the hiking of the trail? She's lucky to be alive. Don't take notes. She's ill prepared, and with the aid of strangers, who provide rides, showers and food, she \\"makes it\\". I was not inspired. Just saddened.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Considering that this release is better than all Rush albums from Hold Your Fire through and including Test For Echo and illustrates the band's desire to maintain their return to form (illustrated in Vapor Trails and Snakes and Arrows), I cannot but help feel extremely disappointed after listening to Clockwork Angels. Yes, Rush's musicianship, integrity, dedication, and energy are all here in this release: a full blown concept album (first time ironically) with an homage to 2112 evident on the cover (military time is 21:12) and thematically (tyranny vs. freedom) throughout this steampunk/alchemic opus; there are killer bass lines reminiscent of very early Lee style playing, Lifeson's guitar is inventive and Peart, as always, has some memorable playing. In addition, some of his best lyrics are here. Despite the unbelievable drive that has overtaken the band since Vapor Trails and clearly heard in Clockwork Angels, I find that something is missing. What's missing? Resonance and cohesiveness in many of the songs themselves are simply not there despite the musical bravado. While half of the songs are solid through and through: Caravan, BU2B, Halo Effect, The Wreckers, Headlong Flight, and The Garden, the other half are disappointing mainly because, for these tracks, only sections of the songs keep me captivated. Some of these tracks grab me immediately and then the chorus comes and the energy falls of. For example, Wish Them Well is a bit trite and the chorus lackluster. Some of the tracks don't grab me immediately but then gain momentum in only certain places unfortunately (Seven Cities of Gold). The Title Track and the two songs that follow are the weakest part of the project: each of these songs doesn't seem to go anywhere (musically speaking; they are crucial to the tale though). Nothing is meant to be filler here; it is just that half the songs don't enthrall me that much; or better said: half of the songs don't enthrall me from start to finish. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart have their hearts in the right place but they often squander many opportunities/moments to be brilliant and blow the listener away giving us instead something mediocre or un-arriving. Since half the tracks here are disappointing, one might say I would give Clockwork Angels 2.5 stars but I won't. There is way too much effort, ambition, and craft here despite its flaws not to mention that, in many ways, this album, like Snakes and Arrows, though sounding nothing like it really, is much more of a culmination of the band's entire body of work (poetically/thematically) considering great songs like: The Fountain of Lamneth, 2112, A Farewell to Kings, Closer to the Heart, The Trees, The Sphere, Open Secrets, Available Light, The Larger Bowl, Faithless, Freewill, and Ghost of a Chance. When you get to the last song The Garden, you will see (HEAR) what I mean. I rate each song accordingly (in order on a scale of 1 to 10): 9, 9, 7.5, 6, 6, 8, 7, 8, 12, 6, 6, and 9. After much consideration, I give this release 3 stars. Overall, 50% of the songs are amazing. I could argue, all things considering, that there aren't too many artists these days that can put out a work where half of the songs are fantastic. Yet I am very disappointed because I expected more. I think that the band should have stayed in the studio while creating Caravan and BU2B instead of going on tour. I think that time off on the road for so long disrupted the inspiration and creative roll that they were on. You do want to buy this though. It is worth having. It's just not their best.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Magnificent! True to form, Rush have released a masterwork that ranks with the best of their albums, and a concept album to boot! You can hear the time, care and love that was poured into this work by the band.
B000001FY7|5.0|I was walking through a shopping center when I heard the title cut from this Bob Marley album blasting over the outdoor speakers. It sounded great, brought back many fond memories, and reminded me that Bob Marley transcended the Reggae genre. He was a Rock Star, and he transcended the Rock genre. Other Rock Stars were in awe of him. He was to Reggae Music what Hank Williams was to Country. He led a big band with the authority of a James Brown or a Fela Kuti.<br /><br />This album is one of his best, with high production values, and a big sound from a big band, with background singers, horn section, percussion, Marley's skanking guitar, keyboards, and of course, the awesome bass and drums. It sounds like it was a well rehearsed band that nailed every song on the first take, recorded all at the same time, no over dubs, like they used to do at Motown. I don't know if it actually was done like that, but that is the impression I get.<br /><br />\\"Easy Skanking\\" starts with a slow dance groove. \\"Skanking\\" is apparently a slow dance, and NOT what it sounds like: the lowering of standards to rock bottom that occurs 15 minutes before last call. The dance is designed so that you can do it all night while in the high tropical temperatures of Jamaica, or even during a Bakersfield summer. \\"Skanking\\" is kind of along the same lines as the classic \\"Jamming\\" groove-wise. I love it when the back up singers answer Marley's call for \\"Easy Skanking\\" with \\"skanking it easy\\" and then when he repeats the title they go \\"skanking it slow\\" with a dip on the \\"slow\\" that is so slow and sensual it makes you want to swoon.<br /><br />\\"Kaya\\" is the song I heard in the shopping mall that triggered the urge to write this review. I don't know what Kaya is, but I want some? Why? Because the rain is falling--and it's June. This song is thematically similar to \\"Rainy Day, Dream Away\\" by Jimi Hendrix. It starts with an organ riff that is answered by the back up singers soto voce.<br /><br />The next cut asks the musical question: \\"Is This Love?\\" It begins with a snappy little intro before digging into the hook with lush support from the back up singers. I think we know the answer to this question. Yes, it most definitely is. This song is the hit single of an album of hits. Marley gets so much mileage out of such simple words, like sunshine, rain, and love. This song posits Marley together with his beloved \\"with the roof right over our head.\\" Then he sings, \\"We'll share the shelter of my single bed.\\" In other words, just the basics of shelter: A roof over our heads and a bed, albeit a shared single bed.<br /><br />\\"Sun Is Shining\\" is in a minor key, which is kind of cool. Only a few songs ago it was raining, yet there was an exuberant mood, the opposite of what you'd expect. In \\"Shining\\" the rhythm guitar shines cool and spooky, with a little echo to enhance the shimmer. The bass drops in and out dramatically, in true Dub fashion. Here we have a chromatic line rising and falling over minor chords, like the song Sinatra sang called \\"In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\\" or Irving Berlin's \\"Blue Skies.\\"  Now that I think of it, both \\"Shining\\" and \\"Blue Skies\\" juxtapose sunny weather and blue skies with a chromatic line over a minor  sound that you would not expect.<br /><br />\\"Satisfy My Soul\\" is Marley's version of \\"Satisfaction\\" but it is miles apart in its cynicism to sincerity ratio. Marley is asking for satisfaction of his soul, doncha know, not his body. It starts with a little cliche that might have come from the Disco hit \\"Rock My Boat\\" when Marley asks that his boat not be rocked \\"because I don't want my boat to be rocked.\\" You would almost think that you would want your boat to be rocked, but I guess not. It continues with lines such as \\"when I meet you around the corner you make me feel like a sweepstakes winner.\\"<br /><br />\\"She's Gone\\" is a little lamentation that bemoans the lose of his lover, who felt imprisoned.<br /><br />\\"Misty Morning\\" blasts off with an excellent intro from the horn section, which I might mention is a fantastic horn section. Far better than the usual. Another weather report from Marley, who missed his calling it seems. He is also a frustrated news anchor here, as there is some news and analysis of the political situation. This train of thought continues in the next song.<br /><br />\\"Crisis\\" seems to be a serious song but I am not really sure what he is saying, as his Jamaican mannerisms and accent make it difficult to discern. When I first heard Bob Marley, his voice sounded strange, but of course I grew to love the sound of it. Here, though, it makes it a little hard to hear what the words are. I can clearly hear him say \\"No matter what the crisis is. No matter what the crisis is.\\" but then what comes after is hard to say. Does he say \\"doing it, doing it, doing it, doing it\\"? And if so, doing what?<br /><br />\\"Running Away\\" is back in the minor mode, with Marley preaching with Moral Authority against those who \\"can't run away from themselves.\\" He gets into an intimate stage whispered rap section, with trombone obligatto. The trombone is featured in this song, which is great to hear, though of course it doesn't surpass the trombone solo in Frank Sinatra's version of Cole Porter's \\"I've Got You Under My Skin.\\" But really, what in life does?<br /><br />\\"Time Will Tell\\" ends the set on a more soothing--but still on his preacher's soapbox--Gospel Reggae note. What will time tell? \\"You think you're in heaven but you're living in hell.\\"<br /><br />The bottom line is that Kaya is an excellent album, with Bob Marley at the height of his powers as a vocalist, song writer, and band leader. The production values are through the roof, with song after song another potential hit single, absolutely no filler. Though I might prefer the raw excitement of some of his earlier work, and have Marley favorites that were from prior days, this is all in all a great Bob Marley album. His untimely death is such a tragedy, but at least he was able to leave a body of work that left a huge impact on the world, and still sounds fresh and alive even now.ith an excellent intro from the horn section, which I might mention is a fantastic horn section.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|In typical Rush form, the songs are well structured and rhythmical, and it is clear that all members take advantage of rocking out with their instruments. The arrangements are great as are the songs. Nick R brings out some cool things, but I think a lot of fans have become accustomed to the mode Terry Brown operated in, and what he brought out of Rush. As Geddy himself said, Rush is about moving forward and exploring new heights and new ways.<br /><br />Rush is one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Period!
B006ON41FC|5.0|its fun and if your rate I bad. or lower than 4 stars u are a hater I love itttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
B007UWBGVS|5.0|Great balance of funky pop songs that make you want to dance and emotional ballads for a more serious mood.  \\"Shady\\" is my favorite with funky guitar riffs by the legendary Nile Rodgers.  Love the hints of throwbacks to older sounds without feeling retro.  And Adam Lambert's voice is amazing!<br />With the current promo price you can add individual downloads of the three bonus songs and still get a great deal.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|all I have to say is this app rocks. I used it on my kindle fire and its great. no adds, and the graphics are amazing. I give this a definite 5 star.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|I recommend this motion-capture animated adventure to families who don't want their movies to be spoiled by foul language or other cultural toxins.  It's an action movie (Indiana Jones for Kids, some other reviewer said) that is an enjoyable ride, if somewhat over-the-top frenetic at times.  Especially the chase scene when they are rushing out of Morocco, is frenetic to the point of ridiculousness.  But, the motion-capture animation is incredibly realistic and makes you think sometimes that you're seeing a real film.  The characters of Tintin, Captain Haddock, Snowy and the evil Sakharine (descendent of Red Rackham) are very enjoyable to watch!  The plot line is fun, albeit unrealistic, but this is Tintin, after all!<br /><br />Flaws in my opinion:  (1) over-the-top frenetic action by Spielberg is geared towards the limited attention span of today's video-playing youth; (2) there actually is a lot of violence (shooting mostly, and fist fighting), but in a cartoonish sort of way.  Being like an Indiana Jones flick you'd expect that, but for young kids, parents beware that lots of \\"bad guys\\" get killed.<br /><br />Drinking: You know, you call it a \\"kid's movie\\" but the subject of drinking and sobriety is handled in a pretty adult way (in a good sense) in Tintin.  Captain Haddock is a funny drunk at first but then he gets sober and he becomes a much more admirable character.  I like this responsible attitude re drinking, or getting high in general, which many other sophomoric Hollywood films could use.<br /><br />Overall though, it's enjoyable adventure and even intelligent at times! Which is more than I can say, for example, about the 2011 Three Musketeers.  In the words of Captain Haddock's worst oath, \\"Blistering Blue Barnacles!\\"
B007JMW46U|5.0|I have always been a fan and this book was easy to read and the storylines were typical of Sherlock Holmes. Only thing is that each story was too short! Great!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and to really appreciate book one I think you need to read the entire trilogy. Of course the idea behind the trilogy is a bit far fetched but that is what makes it so fun and exciting to read. This is the type of book to really get lost in and enjoy. I am surprised by the negative reviews, I think many of them are too critical of the writer and the ideas in the book. All in all it was a great beginning to a wonderful trilogy! I can't wait for more from the author!
0307891372|5.0|This is an extremely helpful guide!! It has information on every species, weapon, jewelry, clothing, food, potions, spells, quest, dungeon, location, and anything else I forgot in the game.<br /><br />How to combine what ingredients to make what potion.<br /><br />How to smith weapons and armor.<br /><br />How to enchant weapons, armor, and items.<br /><br />Step by step instructions on how to complete EVERY main, side, and miscellaneous quest in the game.<br /><br />What character you should be to better suit your playing style.<br /><br />What damage, weight, and cost of every weapon, food, jewelry, and clothing/armor in the game.<br /><br />Anything you can think of that would make a great game guide is in here, and totally worth the money. BUT......with that all said, you can basically find all of this same information online at Wikipedia.<br /><br />IMO, I would save your money, and just check Wikipedia out instead. I find myself using both, but I can still find anything I want online. Just a thought. You can't go wrong in buying this guide, so don't let that stop you, but you can find darn near everything in the guide online. I do have this guide, and it is very awesome though!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice Age Village is your typical 'create your village' game but with a major difference: Gameloft is extremely generous with the currency (acorns &amp; coins). Folks, that means it's easy to earn really cool stuff and without paying! You aren't a second class citizen for not buying faux currency!<br />I love these types of games, but this one is far superior to all the rest. It's so fun and looks really good too.<br />TeamLava should take notes; their games are like having an unrewarding job with bad pay!<br />Ice Age Village is great fun with lots of rewards.
0345479092|4.0|I've read all of the 1-star critiques of this book after having read the actual book cover-to-cover several times. I started using it when my baby was 2 months old and I breastfeed.<br /><br />After some \\"accidental parenting\\" (based on popular techniques like sharing a bed, etc) that lead to my baby wanting to be carried at all times, only being able to sleep on a human chest, which lead to many sleepless nights and postpartum health problems for mom, I realized that my baby care was unsustainable and that I will not make it as a mom with my sanity intact.<br /><br />It would be useful to have more details and troubleshooting on some of the techniques Hogg & Blau propose, but other than that, they advocate a STRUCTURED YET FLEXIBLE routine, NOT a schedule. They specifically discourage schedules and watching the clock (though it helps to keep general time so you know how long it's been since last feed, how much sleep baby is getting, etc). This is extremely useful, as it takes much of the guesswork out of what your baby's needs are at the moment. All sources seem to agree that babies run on 2 and half to 3 hour feeding cycles except during growth spurts when they may want to eat more frequently, so why not build a routine of naps, diapering and play time around these feeding cycles?<br /><br />They do not advocate ignoring your baby's cries in deference to routine; they specifically say \\"never leave a crying baby,\\" and advocate soothing her. They discuss how to interpret baby's various cries. The part where they discuss breaking bad habits that you've unwittingly taught your baby is very useful for correcting behaviors that you realize you can no longer sustain and that you never meant to continue for months (like baby sleeping on your chest all night!). One example involved helping a baby sleep in his own crib, one who was traumatized by the cry-it-out method after his parents got fed up with sharing their bed. He needed serious help and trust-building to even getnear his crib, which he associated with crying to the point of vomiting! (Shared-bedders should beware of how things may be months down the road...)<br /><br />Cluster feeding, dream feeding and one-sided feeding I have found so far to be very successful with helping baby get enough calories to sleep through the night. My baby sleeps about 8 hours starting at 3 months old.<br /><br />Because I found the book's techniques useful for my 2 month+ baby and the 1-star critics to be severely misinformed about much of what the book says, I had to write this review.<br /><br />I recommend this book for parents who want what has worked out for me to be a healthy and sustainable routine for baby. But you need to read it carefully, take notes and draw your own thoughtful plans for how you want to implement the techniques, particularly if you are trying to break an unsustainable habit.

B007BZM30M|3.0|Superfluous, silly, synthetic, sugar-coated, sappy, superficial... just a few adjectives that describe the pop songs that bookmark the passing of our lives. This one is no exception. It will easily serve its purpose and link us to that particular time and those connected memories. It will remind us of things we did when that song was choking the airwaves, when music producers & bad singers desperately relied on Auto-Tune to make a buck. Here today, gone tomorrow- just like us.
030746363X|5.0|I have struggled with my weight most of my adult life. The only time in my life when weight was not an issue was when I was training hard 4-6 days a week kickboxing or doing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. A large part of my problem is I grew up with the old food pyramid that told me most of my calories should come from carbs. The 4 hour body taught me how wrong this was. I have lost 14 pounds on the slow carb diet.
B00782O7NE|5.0|The people who financed THE ARTIST must have been crazy.<br /><br />After all, what audience in 2011 would embrace a black-and-white, essentially silent, movie with a predictable plot that borrowed elements from many classic American films (e.g. A STAR IS BORN, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN and even CITIZEN KANE)?<br /><br />In this instance, insanity paid off.  THE ARTIST is truly a joyful motion picture, filled with humor and emotions that evoke memories of timeless masterpieces like Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS.<br /><br />Written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, the ingenious film walked away with virtually every major award in the 2011 season, climaxing its astounding success with five Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor (Jean Dujardin) and Best Picture.<br /><br />Set in Hollywood during the late 1920s when the movies were on the verge of talking, the story tells of a romantic leading man (Dujardin) in the Douglas Fairbanks tradition, who is tossed aside with the introduction of sound by his studio, the public and his wife.  Conversely, on the way up the ladder to stardom is a young actress (Berenice Bejo), sort of a Ruby Keeler type, who the actor had helped when she was still struggling.  There is a definite connection between these two, and when Ms. Bejo becomes the biggest star in the movies, she secretly tries to help the now penniless, proud and alcoholic former superstar of the silents.<br /><br />One doesn't have to be a genius to anticipate virtually every plot turn in THE ARTIST, but that's okay because the charm of this story is the engaging way that the director has chosen to tell it.  He has even filmed his picture in Los Angeles on locations where, eighty or so years ago, scenes like these might actually have taken place.<br /><br />My only complaint, definitely a minor one, is that the picture could have lost perhaps ten minutes in its second half.  Dujardin's fall from grace and his scenes of self-pity do go on a bit too long.<br /><br />THE ARTIST boasts a marvelous supporting cast that includes James Cromwell, John Goodman, Penelope Ann Miller, Malcolm McDowell,  Ed Lauter and, of course, \\"Uggie,\\" the Jack Russell terrier that steals every scene that he's in.<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is filled with extras, including a blooper reel, a Q&A with filmmakers and cast, and several \\"making of\\" featurettes,  one of which looks at the various filming locations today and as they were back in the time when this movie is set.<br /><br />© Michael B.

Now, I want to read more about Grey's transition in becoming a healed soul.  And I hope he does.  I hope that Anastasia does not get pulled into his world.

B007MXB9XK|3.0|This book has pictures of projects that are not contained in the edition, such as the cover photo, among many others, that the schemes are not in the application, although it explains the principles used to make them. Beginners will want clear and precise guidelines about the most challenging applications. In this book lacked that. The schematic level is good, and the explanation of the contents are fairly simple, so that anyone can follow the process. Good impression. Unfortunately my book, despite being new, arrived in poor condition, with spotted leaves and bent.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|This CD is a little over an hour but does not seem that long at all.  The CD player effortlessly spun out 5, 6, and 7 minute songs that pay homage to their past compositions without dwelling on them.<br /><br />You will hear moments from some classic songs and find new ones to appreciate throughout this album.  During interviews, the members of Rush have said they are playing at their best and from this album,  I would be hard pressed to disagree.<br /><br />Yeah, it is a concept album and as such does hang together as a suite of songs.  But somehow it is done in such a way that the songs are also able to hang apart.  This is something that the album side long compositions of their early career were unable to achieve.<br /><br />There is a range of emotions on this CD from the wide-eyed optomisim and youthful energy in \\"Caravan\\" through the resigned wisdom of \\"Wish Them Well\\" and everything in between.  Listening to it is just a great experience.<br /><br />I would offer one word of advice, buy this on the CD and listen to it on some sort of home or car sound system.  I have read some reviews complaining about muddiness or a lack of sonic clarity on the album.  MP3's are just inferior to CD's and this album with it's deep bass notes and glistening highs will reveal that inferiority.<br /><br />Buy the CD, play it on a CD player and enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The main character -Anastasia- say Jeez a lot. It gets annoying and it's unnecessary.<br />Christian is way over the top. Too perfect and unreal in every aspect.<br />Anastasia is no heroin and does not impress me. She annoys throughout the story.<br />The sex and conversations between the main characters is dragged on in every chapter. It gets old early.<br /><br />It is definitely a book that fans of Twilight will enjoy because it is Twilight in the intensity of a relationship between an impossibly perfect, handsome and rich young male and a self-consious, plain and simple female. Coincidentally, the un-likelyhood of such relationship in real life but the desire of some readers that it could be possible, might be the reason why both books gather a large following.

I've seen every great British mystery television series I can get my hands on... everything from \\"Wire in the Blood\\" to \\"Inspector Morse\\" and Sherlock ranks up there with the best of them.  I was shocked by the brilliant acting, the character development is excellent and I'm crushed that I'll have to wait over a year for another season of this top notch series.  If you haven't seen any of this Sherlock series, I'm jealous... and my advise would be to start with the first show of the first season so you can see how this fascinating group of people came together.  Sherlock is the highest quality television show I've seen in years and if this is your first look at British mystery television, lucky you!!!<br /><br />S.M. Kyle
0345803485|2.0|I like to read books that many probably wouldn't. Twilight (yes), hunger games etc.  Yes I am a grown woman and my boyfriend laughs at my 'teen' choice in reading material but I love those kind of books.  My point is that I am by no means a literary snob but I have to say that this is absolutely, without exception, the worst thing I have read.<br /><br />I'd heard all about this franchise and it kept winking at me from the shelf of the bookstore so I went ahead and bought all three.  I would suggest you don't bother.<br /><br />Whoever said this was good or whoever decided to publish it should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. The sex scenes are repetitive and dull and at some points just plain hilarious. The writing is really quite terrible and when you get to Ana 'flushing crimson' for the 89th time, it becomes quite wearing.<br /><br />I probably should have given up but I bought all three and I will read them, however, now I'm on the 3rd book (skipping all sex scenes now) its getting to the point where this feels like I'm punishing myself for some unkown reason.  Maybe for buying them in the first place without reading a review.<br /><br />I hear its being made into a film.......<br />To give you an idea of the standard of content, I would say that all 3 books could be made into one film. There's not a lot going on. Unless they include every single orgasm experienced by our 'heroine'.  He walks into a room and she immediately orgasms. Of course. He cooks and egg, she slithers to the ground in a 'mindblowing, all consuming orgasm' *yawn*<br /><br />If you HAVE to see for yourself, just read a few pages of someone elses. Don't waste your money.
0439023521|5.0|Book was amazing! The author has to have a pretty sick mind to come up with the plot of teens killing each other for entertainment, but the book was so well written. I got sooooo hooked and couldn't stop reading. It's one of the absolute best books I've ever read. I'm not old enough to drive yet, so I'm going to bike to a bookstore so I can buy the second book & start reading right now! So amazing. It's a love and survival story all in one.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Age recommendation: 20+<br />Sexual content<br />Violent content<br />Language<br /><br />I know there are many reviews about the violent behavior of Travis (the lead male character); if you have had violence in your life and do not what to read about it then I suggest staying away from this book.<br />Now the rest of this review will be from a person who has never experienced a violent relationship so keep that in mind.<br /><br />I really loved this book.  I thought it was well written. This book had me thinking all day and night.  After I read it I discussed it in detail with my husband about the characters and how they behaved.  While most romance novels only skim the surface of a persons psyche, this book made me think about what made up the characters.<br />I felt that while Travis was a violent man he was not an abuser, co-dependent yes, abuser no. He didn't mentally or physically abuse Abby.  I felt that he had never developed another means of expressing himself other than sex or fighting.  Unfortunately when Abby came along he found himself in new waters and he didn't know how to handle his feelings.  Not everyone in the world is a well adjusted person, I personally believe Travis needed Abby to be a better person.<br /><br />I agree this novel is in no way appropriate for a young reader that does not understand more about what a healthy/unhealthy relationship looks like.  The characters in this book made bad decisions left and right and by no means sets a good example for young readers. As an adult in my 30's I could be more empathetic to the characters than I would have been able to as a teen. I think Abby and Travis started with a very unhealthy relationship but grew and ended with something to build on. This journey took some dips and dives I cried and I laughed.  I highly recommend this book to read just remember it really is a Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />Technology Review:<br /> I did have some issues of sentences disappearing using the kindle app on my iPhone.

Did I find it to be literary genius? No but it was awfully fun to fantasize and really fun getting to know my husband again! For me it was reminisitant to first love and fantasies. The dreams that ignite passion! When all is said and done it not the greatest written book but it sure was FUN to let go!!!!

B007R9MFPU|3.0|I was very excited to hear that the fab four lineup were to make a new release. After their Return To Eden release I was enthusiastic that they would try to recapture some of their past glory in a new CD. Well, they kinda did.<br /><br />Well, this release is mild at best and sounds disjointed. Most songs are so lacking energy and require Midge to whisper or strain his vocals to sound \\"soft\\". I would say it is on par with their relative ages: rock music made by 60-somethings.<br /><br />Many of the songs are mediocre to me and sound like just about anything Ure has put out since the 80's. There is plenty of bass lines, synth solos, violas, and standard Cann drumming to make it sound like a post-Lament release. In this regard I am pleased, but the arrangements just seem so 2-D. There are a few songs I like, but many just cannot captivate me enough to want to listen to it repeatedly. I listen and then put Rage In Eden on repeat to scrub my ears.<br /><br />Live is excellent. Rise is better than average, but the bridge sucks and sounds phoned in (literally and figuratively). Satellite has that RIE sound that I resonate with.<br /><br />The title track may as well be muzak. It does nothing for me.<br /><br />While I wasn't overly impressed with this release I am happy to say that I will listen to it over U-VOX any day. I hope this isn't the last we hear these four make music together, but for a come-back album I would say it is not offensive nor is it an amazing compilation of songs. It is just OK.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I am eternally grateful that I always read through the reviews before I download any apps for my Kindle Fire, even the free ones. I have wanted an Office app, mostly for small word processing stuff when I need to get thoughts down and don't have my laptop with me, but I will just say a big NO to this one and keep looking!  No apps need that kind of access to my personal stuff.

Claire Dane wow! So looking forward to seeing Season 2.  Only keeping Showtime to watch Homeland.

0887431453|4.0|I do like this book, and have found some things in it that will be valuable to my 4 year old son.  However, most of those pages are helpful because they are coloring, which he needs practice with.  He has known all of his letters and numbers since he was 2, so most of these skills were not helpful to him.  So if your child is already comfortable with recognizing letters and numbers, I think I would try to find something more challenging.  Most of the pages in this book are connect the dots or coloring.  It is helpful with letter writing skills, and with teaching him to follow directions.  I do wish it was more challenging, though.

0375507256|1.0|I started reading this book because it was categorized under \\"dystopian\\" in some reading list and the reviews seemed to be generous. But I can't, for the life of me, figure out what the point to the book is. The stories seen to barely intermingle, and the stories themselves seem to have vague plots to them that I can't get interested in. I trudged my way through the first story, hoping it would get better as some have said, and forced my way through the second, hoping still. I got through the third story, but just barely and skipped the fourth because I'm so sick of the change in writing styles. The 6th story was interesting enough once I figured out the new language but as I'm reading the center story, I'm trying to figure out why I'm even bothering. As far as I can tell, this book is just short stories that kind of intermingle. I don't even really like short stories that much.
B007RP4D5Y|5.0|Pat Metheny is incredibly multi-faceted and prolific. In the recent past he has created Orchestrion, What It's All About and now this project which has shades of Michael Brecker and Pat's 80/81 album. I am in the middle of my first listen and it is quite good -- actually really, really good -- and I would recommend it for any die hard or even a tepid Metheny fan. Most of the tracks are excellent, perhaps one 'experimental' track; listening to track 9 right now -- Breakdealer -- it is energetic and engrossing.

1455844217|5.0|I just finished the audio-book version of Wonder, and the book is indeed a Wonder! When I was in high school, there was a classmate who was blind due to an illness he suffered as a baby. He wasn't born blind, but became blind at such an early age he has no memories of seeing the world we all take for granted. His condition made his face different than his classmates, but he never complained that he was blind, or that he had facial malformations that made some of his peers avoid him. There were classes where assigned seating placed him behind me, and daily I'd say hello and ask him how he was doing. He was quiet, but always very polite to me, and that was the extent of our relationship. I always wondered every day how life must be for him, if he heard some of the things that other kids said about him, and if so was he used to them? Did he care? Did he cry at home? I know as a younger boy he probably endured harsher words from his peers, but by high school when I met him (I moved there from another city) he was just a kid that most of my peers had grown up with, and I never saw any outright meanness directed at him. I sometimes wished I'd said more to him, but I was a bit of a shy kid to begin with, and I honestly wasn't sure if he wanted to be bugged.<br /><br />Wonder instantly made me think of those days, sitting next to the kid that looked like no kid I'd ever seen, and haven't seen the like of since. I know that by the time I met him most of the nastiness associated with school bullies was over, but I can picture his younger childhood being similar to August, the main character in this book. Reading this book makes me wish I could go back and talk to him more than I did, and if I bugged him by talking to him as much as I did with my best school friends, well darnit he would just have to tell me to shut up!<br /><br />I hope there is a sequel to Wonder. For one, I just loved the characters, each one with their own distinct voice, but mainly I just want to know what happens next! I see a bright future for such a brave character as the one R.J. Palacio has created, and would pay to read about every second of it. I am going to encourage my children to read this book, as it is such a great example of bravery, friendship, loyalty, and kindness.<br /><br />The book itself is fantastic, but I also want to add that the readers of this audio-book (there are multiple, for multiple character viewpoints) really brought these characters to life, and while listening you just know, you've just heard those characters speaking to you directly.t happens next!

B005LAIH54|4.0|\\"The time of the Gods is ending but the son of Zeus cannot hide from his destiny forever.\\" Perseus (Worthington) is doing is best to forget his old life and make it without the help of any of the Gods. Perseus is not the only one trying to make it alone and the Gods are beginning to lose control of the Titans. When Zeus' (Neeson) other son Ares teams with Hades to take control and kidnaps Zeus and imprisons him in Hell there is only one who can rescue him. I have to start by saying I have never been a fan of movies like this. I couldn't get into \\"Clash Of The Titans\\", \\"Immortals\\", or even \\"300\\". I say that so I can say that this was very entertaining and I really enjoyed this one a lot. Not only was this action packed with great effects the story was actually entertaining as well. There is enough mythology for purists, but not too much to scare off people like me. Another amazing thing about this one is that it is a rare sequel that is better then the first one. While this is not really a movie you have to pay attention to the entire time or you are lost it is still a very entertaining movie and it is fun and relaxing to watch something like this every once in a while. Overall, a very entertaining popcorn movie that is better then the original. I give it a B+

B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Salem Witch Trials...<br /><br />Because of a mistake, innocent lives were lost.  This haunting tale brings back the past into the present with the wonderful retelling of Past lives never really ending.<br /><br />Sophia hears voices, she thinks them a curse.  They in fact are not.  It's a gift that helps her and her friends.  Her past comes back because of a doomed love that has spanned four generations in Sophia's life...and yet they are all Sophia.<br /><br />Because of Ivory's inaction; Sophia's real story is told and retold all through memories.<br /><br />I love this fact because it is memories of life, or in fact history that tends to repeat itself especially when something hasn't been answered or finished the way the Universe deems it should.<br /><br />Rebecca weaves the 5 Elements into different species of Supernatural with the Spirit Element being that of the human realm.  Yes Vampires, shifters, fire elementals and the like keep the balance but it's the Witches that help them all.  The diatribe of corruption and power is shown through the different races of Supernaturals and it's because of Sophia's past, that she is one of the few \\"myths\\" come to life.  The Forever Girl is a reincarnation of the original spirit with a quest left unsaid or something in her life left undone.  Even in the end of this first novel, the premise of what Sophia needs to do is there and yet so much was left unsaid.<br /><br />The Dual-Natured being wiped out in genocide because they abominations...and yet the Queen of the Cruor is dual-natured herself.  Half Cruor...half unknown.  Her own personal vendetta against half breeds because she is one.  The ultimate ending where that will lead; only we can speculate but the seeds have been sown.<br /><br />This is one series that I will definitely read over and over again as the history within the fiction is what brings the mind to wonder...What If.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|There can be too many \\"boo!\\" moments in a film, I realized as I watched \\"The Woman In Black.\\" A \\"boo!\\" moment, of course, is when the camera pans across a room and, just for a second, we see a demon watching our hero (in this case, Daniel Radcliffe), or, the camera lingers upon an object (a window, say) while our hero looks outside, and then...a face appears in the window next to him! Noooo!<br /><br />Save for these moments (and there are a lot of them), \\"The Woman In Black\\" is a quiet, effective ghost story set in Victorian England. A woman with a secret past dies, and leaves a mansion behind that must have been built by architects related to H. R. Giger. Needless to say, the mansion is haunted, and poor Daniel Radcliffe, besot by financial problems, must try his darndest to sell it so that he can make a life for his son, even as the local villagers give him the evil eye for daring to step foot in the mansion. Why one of these villagers never simply runs up to him and says, \\"There's a crazy ghost-witch in that house and she does awful things to people when you go into her house!\\" I'll never know, but instead they hang back and scowl at Radcliffe's character as he just tries to go about his day.<br /><br />If it all sounds rather generic, well, it is. But the movie, crafted by a reboot of the old Hammer Films Studio, is technically well-done and written competently enough to create a decent experience out of an overdone genre. There are too many \\"boo!\\" moments, yes, but the overall mood of the film is rather somber and creepy. The set design is great, and the clattering little tinker toys that fill up the mansion shelves are among the most horrid toys I've ever seen in my life. The plot moves smoothly and never gets bogged down in unnecessary exposition or bloated pretension. The movie knows what it wants to be. It is a haunted house movie, through and through, and while that lack of ambition makes it somewhat mundane, it also ensures that the movie never overstaysits welcome. There's a horrible mansion, a cruel ghost, and an awful secret, and that is as far as the narrative extends. Radcliffe is likable, the ghost is appropriately furious, and the ending, while obvious, doesn't cheat.<br /><br />All in all, a competent piece of genre fiction that will entertain you and then quickly fade from your memory. You could do much worse.

1781161097|5.0|Prometheus The Art of the Film is an incredible companion piece to Ridley Scott's return to science fiction.  The essay by Scott on the film's evolution is incredibly incitefull and refreshing to find a director who is willing to grow with their ideas.  In a day and age of CGI everything, the production stills of the sets construction was refreshing.  I truly believe it is best when an actor/actress can see what they are supposed to be reacting to.  The early concept paintings are near photograph quality and contain the original end sequence which I really thing would have been very cool.  The detail of the sets when you stop and examine them adds a sense of awe not only to the designers but the people who so fully realized this new world.    Click below for more  [...]

B007MAETA8|2.0|I own all of John Mayer's previous albums and I can see this album being a departure from his past albums and experimenting with something different.  This album borders on Country music for me and I don't know if he's taking that approach to win more listeners from that demographic or not but this album is something I'd use to help me fall asleep if I wanted to listen to something soft.  I see his album has many good reviews so maybe people are hearing things I cannot I'm wondering if the album may grow on me but my initial thoughts are probably not.  I'd like to hear something more progressive from John Mayer when he heads back to the studio to record his next album.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|When this was on sale, I checked out some of the reviews, and they were so good, I jumped at getting an upgrade from the Quadrilogy.  The first drawback was a notice on the screen basically saying my Samsung Blu-ray player doesn't have enough memory to take advantage of the skip-the-garbage-at-the-beginning feature or the MU-TH-R program.  That's not the disk's fault of course (Samsung has proven to be a MAJOR disappointment to me), but it means I'm not getting everything out of the set that I should.  But it's all about the movies, right?  I can live with the FBI warning.  So I started watching the films.  The transfers are everything the other reviewers say they are, except....  I saved Aliens for last and just got finished watching it--sort of.  Good as it is, the picture kept stuttering and jiggling and the scene index would periodically pop up for no reason at all.  Amazon's going to send me a replacement, but much as I love the franchise, I'm not looking forward to watching all four movies again quite so soon.  I guess I should feel special, since nobody else seems to have had this problem, but this kind of special I don't need.
030758836X|1.0|For one who loves to read good fiction this book is NOT the answer.  Trite, predictible, boring. Never moves, just keeps poking along.  First person narratives seldom achieve the goal of good writing and this is no exception.  The end is totally predictible from the first two chapters.  Plot never THICKENS but just runs on and on and on.  Ending is flat and leaves the reader wondering why the author spent all this time writing --- and --- leaves the reader feeling like a fool for wasting their time reading it all the way to the end.
1936608898|5.0|ISWF is the book that I have highly anticipated, having followed Dallas and Melissa's blog and their Whole30 program for a while, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />Whether the reader is familiar with their methods or is brand new to whole9 philosophy there is much to learn here. It's more than just a compilation of scientific information and personal anecdotes. The Hartwigs have obviously done tons of research but they have a rare knack of being able to deliver it in style, with humour and in a language my grandmother would understand. And I can vouch for the science: to my knowledge, they are on the money.<br /><br />The other aspect that I really liked is that ISWF manages to entirely avoid the typical preachy condescending tone of most nutrition books however doesn't just take responsibility off your shoulders.<br /><br />Best of all is that the authors bring it all together. While it is still very much a nutrition book you can't help but start thinking of your lifestyle as a whole: how you eat, sleep, exercise, interact with your environment.<br /><br />ISWF is definitely a fantastic resource for my future private medical practice. And I will be borrowing quite a few of their clever analogies to explain the science to my patients as well as family and friends.
0451191153|5.0|Truly a brilliantly written story that was years ahead of its time. A page turner that I couldn't put down if ever there was one. Ayn Rand saw where the world was headed with socialism long before the masses. I felt as if I was reading stories in todays papers. The world needs more Howard Roark's, especially in public office at the national level. Sadly Washington DC and the world is filled with Toohey's. Personal responsibility and achievent is penalized and so-called victims of capitalism and other parasites of society are lauded and branded as undeserved heroes. Half of American households are receiving tax payer funds in some form. This can never be sustained. Europe is already too far gone, but maybe the U.S. can be rescued from the evils of collectivism if we wake up immediately and realize individual freedom and the capitalist spirit ordained by our brilliant founders is what made us the greatest country in the history of the world. Pitty Ayn Rand's wonderful novels couldn't have been read more widely and the common-sense ideals propagated applied much sooner.
0345803485|4.0|I really enjoyed this book it's a great read! I wish that I had ordered all three 50 shades at the same time because it ends as a chapter .. I can't wait to receive the next two and pick up where I left off.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I often have trouble sleeping, especially at dialysis. Sleepy Time is the perfect solution! All the sounds are realistic(though some are a tad puzzling or even downright annoying, such as the red and brown noises). I like that you have so many sounds to choose from, and that you can mix up to three--individual volumes and all-- for the perfect sleep mix. And you can save your faces.<br /><br />At home I used to listen to the nature channel or to Seasalt Radio on iTunes Radio, but sometimes those would turn off after a few hours. And on my Kindle, mobile radio stations might cost extra money per month. Sleepy Time is perfect, simply turn it on and add a good, quality pair of headphones with noise cancel and good bass. Instant sleep success for as long as you need it. Highly recommended for any insomniacs.

B005LAIGF0|5.0|This was a movie that makes you simply say WOW by the end of the film. It is powerful and spellbinding and the depths to which the characters fall is simply something that you would not imagine. Early in the film the tragedy mentioned above is definitely something that most would not be able to survive without psychological intervention (in my opinion) and the movie gets stronger from there. There were definitely points in the film that emotionally you might want to turn away, but with strong writing and an amazing cast, this movie just works!
0345803485|1.0|I never write reviews,but after reading all 3 fifty shades book,I had to say something. It is basically twlight with sex. And the sex....every time these two look t each other they have sex and climax after 2 seconds on command. How many times can this writer repeat the same lines? What the hell,\\"the apex of my thighs\\"? \\"Stop biting your lip\\" \\"Mrs Grey,Mr Grey\\". Ugh! He posesses Ana like a toy,stalks her,takes over her boring life,and she goes along with it because \\"he's fifty shades of f*&%ed up\\". She looks up through her lashes at him,he grins o broods,andjust like Twlight he buys her a car,her birthday is in september,he buys her a charm bracelet,she lives in Washington,I mean,I could go on and on. But basically this book was boring,annoying and pretty laughable. I had to force myself through the last book,praying it would hurry up and end! And is it just me or did anyone ele picture Christian as being british?
B006P0FIGU|1.0|This movie was so incredibly Unrealistic I thought,momentarily, a large speckled unicorn had invaded my home, eaten all good sense and left me with feelings of angst and no chap stick. I honestly have no idea if that was supposed to be a comedy or was just made by immensely idiotic midgets with no fashion sense. Throughout the entire movie the main character D'Artagnan's hair was plastered to his metaphorical and literal huge head. I really hated this movie. Don't Buy it.

B00005AXEL|5.0|I first purchased `Trouble in Shangri-La' when it was released in May 2001; I remember the month because the day I bought it I went to enjoy a day in the sun at a friend's house.  We pumped this album through the house's stereo system as we enjoyed the outside.  After that day I listened to this album non-stop for about six months.  I'm pretty sure my friends were planning an intervention.  In truth I do this whenever I love any new CD, by any artist I love.  I've been a diehard Stevie Nicks/Fleetwood Mac fan for as long as I can remember, and `Trouble in Shangri-La' restored my faith that Stevie could still write a brilliant album.<br /><br />Since I've never written a review for this album, I decided to go back and listen to it from beginning to end today after listening to last year's `In Your Dreams' from start to finish.  `In Your Dreams' has been playing on my iPod and home stereo with high frequency for the past year.  I wanted to see how well `Trouble in Shangri-La' held up after eleven years.  All of Stevie's work holds a special place in my heart, and I don't think I could say I dislike any of it (even `Street Angel,' which let's face it, was not a great album).  However, `Trouble in Shangri-La' sounds as fresh today as `In Your Dreams.'  Both albums could be played back-to-back, or some of the songs could be interchanged and you would not know they had been produced a decade apart.<br /><br />Like `In Your Dreams' I can listen to `Trouble in Shangri-La' from start to finish.  The album opens with the slow-building title track.  You think you're in for a mid-tempo song but you can feel the thunder building in Stevie's voice and the song sort of explodes around you.  \\"Candlebright\\" follows; a slow-paced ballad, it took me a few listens to warm to thing song.  \\"Sorcerer\\" is a song that Stevie has been singing since the BuckinghamNicks days.  In fact there are several old demos for the song.  Finally updated and sung with Sheryl Crow, this song was Stevie's third single from the album.  The fourth track was the first single.  \\"Planets of the Universe\\" is a thunderous track reminiscent of \\"Edge of Seventeen.\\"  The song is dark, moody, and full of rage.  There's a great demo for the song on the 2004 reissue of Fleetwood Mac's `Rumours,' for which the song was originally penned.  The 2001 update has additional lyrics; if you're lucky you can still find the CD-single which has full six-and-a-half minute full version that was edited for the album.  \\"Every Day,\\" the second single, was not penned by Stevie, but fits the spirit of her voice and album.  It's a nice mid-temp sing-a-long.  Natalie Maines joins Stevie on \\"Too Far From Texas.\\"  I always wondered why this was not released a single for country radio, since the Dixie Chicks had a number one hit covering Stevie's \\"Landslide.\\"  \\"That Made Me Stronger\\" is my least-favorite song on the album, but its inclusion is important simply because of its significance.  Stevie had asked long-time friend Tom Petty to help her write a song in 1995.  Tom refused, saying Stevie knew how to write her own songs.  That was the kick in the pants that became this album.  The Sheryl Crow-penned \\"It's Only Love\\" is a quiet beauty.  Stevie's voice is fragile and uncertain on this track, a nice contrast to some of the angrier tracks.  Sheryl herself sang this song on her 2002 album, `C'mon, C'mon,' but recorded it as an up-tempo ballad and it just didn't work.  \\"Love Changes\\" is very pop-sounding musically but it works because of the mature lyrics.  The song reflects a conversation that all of us, at some point in our lives, have had.  Macy Gray contributed harmonies on the island vibe-infused \\"Bombay Sapphires.\\"  My only problem with this track is with the production.  Stevie and Macy both have powerful, unique voices; Macy's vocals should have been more pronounced.  The next song is a peaceful track called \\"I Miss You,\\" which has musical elements from \\"Love Changes\\" and \\"Bombay Sapphires,\\" butalso features acoustic guitar from Lindsey Buckingham.  \\"Fall From Grace\\" is as Stevie herself has put it, the meanest song she's ever written.  The music is full-on rock; her vocals are strong, steady, and fast.  Sheryl Crow's backing vocals are drowned out by the angry storm that is Stevie's voice.  `Trouble in Shangri-La' closes with the tender \\"Love Is,\\" which features background vocals from Sarah McLachlan and percussion from Ash Sood.  I saw Stevie last year when she began touring in support of `In Your Dreams,' and she closed the show with this song (with additional lyrics).<br /><br />If you love `In Your Dreams,' you should give `Trouble in Shangri-La' a spin.
0525478817|5.0|The story is told through the point of view of a sixteen year old girl with cancer by the named of Hazel Grace.  Guarded with cynicism and witt, she reminded me a lot of Juno MacGuff; that same angsty, slightly know-it-all moodiness that comes with being a teenager.  As the story goes on, her \\"layers\\" are slowly peeled back a love interest, Augustus Waters, who she meets at a support group for cancer patients.  Waters is this slightly cocky, self-assured, tender and persistent guy that seems to represent the hope that people need when living with the hard realities of life, like cancer.  There is depth to his character and his pursuit of Hazel makes for a great story line.<br /><br />Cancer seems to be this thief that is sneaking into families and marriages without an invitation, threatening to steal the peace and joy of living.  It brings fear, uncertainty, support groups, more sickness, covered dishes, and tons of medical bills.  It is a delicate subject, but John Green's treatment of it brings a lighter side to the heaviness of it's reality.<br /><br />I laughed out loud several times.  I enjoyed that the characters responded to the realities of cancer as teenagers, and not teenagers trying to be adults.  I appreciated the awkwardness of the character's raw honest at times.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and would recommend it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is like the Besttttt! I was hoping it come out for Kindle Fire, and now I have it and I can't stop! :) the only bad thing about is that it sometimes freezes, I mean it just gets kind of slow.. but rather than that it's an amazing game and addictive.... :D love it! and it's free.. :) :) I recommend it to everyonee!!!! :D
B005LAIIS0|1.0|Waste of time for the most part.  The scene where they climb down the trees and the wolves are already there at the bottom waiting?  Stupid, it should have given them several hours distance between the wolves.  He ends up at their den, which must have been at least 20 miles from the plane.  Makes no sense.  And the ending.  What a joke.  I hate movies that leave it up to the viewer.  It's cheap and over used.  So there is no ending to the film which means you're wasting your time.  I'm glad I just rented it on Netflix.  Not Neeson's best performance either.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|what can i say? it's the single most outlandish, questionable notion ever to ultimately pay off!!<br />we Sherlockians tend hear much about what's supposedly essential. we're told, for instance, that it's utterly vital that it take place on the proverbial \\"foggy night in Old London Town\\"...even though the only major fog Conan Doyle wrote, in THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES, was way out in the country! we're told how he absolutely must wear that Inverness-and-deerstalker ensemble...even though Doyle had nothing to do with that; it was illustrator Sidney Paget's contribution. (and the focus of a priceless inside-joke, by the way.) we're told how absolutely imperative it is for something somewhere to be \\"elementary my dear Watson\\"...despite the fact that that little catchphrase, on top of being rather onerous, technically sprang from Hollywood. well, looks like the Victorian England setting wasn't exactly mandatory, either.<br />i don't expect SHERLOCK to put any of that persnicketty snobbishness to rest, but it should more than convince the open mind of the dangers of such snobbery. the truly preposterous notion of updating the Great Consulting Detective works because creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss knew which elements were indeed indispensible. (by the way, i'm sure i'll be accused of being biased toward the series by those who recognize Moffat as the current leader of my all-time favorite tv series, DOCTOR WHO. well, maybe, but i was just as much biased by the fact that Sherlock is my all-time favorite literary character.)<br />ironically, Benedict Cumberbatch is not only a thoroughly faithfull portrayal of Our Hero, he may be the single most faithfull in years. one of Moffat's goals way to sidestep the cliche' of Sherlock and Dr. Watson being in their 40s or 50s and depict them as Doyle wrote them, young men when they met. this makes room for completely Canonical ideas and nuances that would be cancelled out if they were played by the usual middle-aged actors. we get to see the charactes develop, rather than act on the assumption that they were born into the characters we recognize and remember. THE HOUNDS OF BASKERVILLE, for instance, features a poignant subplot in which Sherlock deals with his very first bout of doubt, confronts (ostensibly for the first time) the possibility that he is fallible. yu won't get that sort of thing from Rathbone and Bruce or Downey and Law. or even Brett and Burke/Hardwicke, really.<br />the three stories as well are a bit outlandish...and quite compelling largely for that very reason. i'm not sure if it takes more imagination or gumption to turn Irene Adler into a dominatrix, or convert THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES from a haunted house story to a tale of an army base shrouded not in fog but conspiracy theroies. as for No. 3, which i was particulrly looking forward to because it's based on one of my very favorite adventures, \\"The Final Problem,\\" it's embellishments actually managed to add a degree of dimension (not least of which via Moriarty's convoluted schem to discredit Our Hero). i must admit that i wasn't sure about actor Andrew Scott and his exaggerated \\"homo\\" take on the Napoleon Of Crime...but i have to admit that he ultimately creeps me out and then some.<br />(as it happens, the DVD of SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS finally turned up just before i wrote this. check out Jared Harris' more conventional Moriarty as well as Scott's hammed-up version, and tell me if you'd like to meet either down the proverbial dark alley on the proverbial dark night.)<br />one of my favorite lines from a Sherlock movie is, ironically, from the parody WITHOUT A CLUE. the plot concerns a Watson who is himself a crime-solving wizard, but who, for fear of how it might reflect on his professional standing, created a fictional cipher to take the credit. the ploy backfired, and public interest in this Sherlock Holmes ultimately led him to hire a drunken, out-of-work actor to portray his creation. early in the film, after a spat and subsequent separation, \\"Holmes\\" chides Watson: \\"you might've created me, but now Sherlock Holmes belongs to the world.\\" that could well be the single most succinct description for art in general that i've ever heard. (well, successful art, anyway.)<br />SHERLOCK neatly exeplifies what the world can do with the art it owns, provided it's handled by owners who understand it, appreciate it, LOVE it. and so does WITHOUT A CLUE, for that matter.y in the film, after a spat and subsequent separation, \\"Holmes\\" chides Watson: \\"you might've created me, but now Sherlock Holmes belongs to the world.\\" that could well be the single most succinct description for art in general that i've ever heard.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have this game on my phone and it's. so much more fun playing on a larger screen. it's a great game to play when you have a few free minutes.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I remember when the film first came out in theaters, and I was a bit skeptical of how effective this movie was going to be. Our Navy unit had a few SEALs around and they were not talking about it much. As it turns out, it is because almost no one even knew about the movie! Seems like it was an indy-sleeper with very little marketing. After the opening weekend, everyone on base was talking about it!<br /><br />First, the movie presents real people doing their real jobs. Nothing ruins a movie for me than watching some pretty-boy actor, shooting his M4 from the hip and 'capping' bad-guys at 200m. No thanks. I'll take real people any day!<br /><br />OK, so here are the negatives:<br />1)The acting is a trifle 'stiff'. It does remind you that these guys are sailors first and actors second. I am fine with that, but you notice it from time to time. That being said, the only time it is 'stiff' is in the scenes that are non-job related. When the action goes on screen, the flow is very natural. I wish they would have put in some real military banter. Listening to these guys in real life cutting each other up is hilarious! They should have let the SEALs improv some lines here and there!<br /><br />2)There are some holes in the plot,especially if you are expecting a \\"Tom Clancy\\" experience.<br /><br />Outside of that, the movie rocks!.<br /><br /> But, you have to first appreciate what you are watching. You are seeing a modestly exaggerated expose' of the SEALs capabilities. (as compared to the silly-stupid hollywood exaggerations....yes, I mean you, charlie sheen in the 1980's SEAL movie!) Most of what they are doing in Act of Valor is a glimpse into this Spec-war world.<br />The movie is unique in feel and style, and worth a view, even if you are not a military buff. My wife was engrossed in this movie despite the fact that she doesn't \\"get\\" why we watch all this military \\"stuff\\".<br />The action is fast and hard. Even the sentimental parts are well done in the context of themovie.<br /><br />I also should mention that this movie is the only pro-military movie out there right now. It means a lot to the military community to be seen as good-guys doing a hard job. Whenever Matt Damon comes out with another of his movies where he preaches (and distorts) about the military, he is not looking for sailors and soldiers to watch it.<br />Now, how about Act of Valor 2???
B0086700CM|5.0|Truly great game! it was challenging at first but then once you got the hang of it... It is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
B0086QS7N2|4.0|It has been said in many other reviews but it is great to hear Rush take a different direction on some of the songs.  Notable favorites include Clockwork Angles, Headlong Flight, and The Garden.  Honorable mention is Wish them Well which was a great surprise from the norm and also I cannot get the tune out of my head.
B00846REIS|5.0|Be prepared, this book is not a light read. Alot of people compare it to Fifty Shades of Grey, um no.......This book is soooooo much better. The characters may be similar but that's all. Some authors can make characters real and some make them just words on a page. Ms. Day makes the characters so real, I cried for them, laughed for them and felt outraged for them. I can't wait for the next book, and I really hope things work out for Gideon and Eva.
B0086700CM|5.0|best app ever people play all of the time in school. it is so addicting. my sister is horrible at it.
0143121006|5.0|A division of the BBC has contracted with Midnight in Peking author French for a television mini-series based on this book, and rightly so. French brings his two decades of China experience, and his exceptional understanding of the country's history, to the work, which weaves together the end-times environment of Beijing in 1937, the intensely personal and tragic experience of the father of the murdered and disemboweled teenager Pamela Werner, and the other Beijing residents of the time.<br /><br />A compelling murder mystery, a remarkable evocation of Beijing in the late 1930s, outstandingly told. Buy, and read, and recommend Midnight in Peking w/out fail.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I caught a couple of episodes last season and was hooked.  I purchased season 1and I've been doing marathons but after this I'll be caught up.  The plots are always interesting, you learn facts about real serial killers, and the character development has been great.  If you're a new viewer you would get probably 90% of the show.<br /><br />The one negative about this set is that there are few extras.  You might see one deleted scene per 4-episode disc.  There's almost nothing from the writers or directors.<br /><br />Despite this I recommend adding this series to your collection.  It's only available on Netflix on disc and it's twice the price on Hulu, so buy it here.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|Utter crap, I am sure he is laughing all the way to the bank that people paid for this product . I thought litte fuzzies was a bit light weight but at least some thought appeared to have gone into it.  This book  is has the smell of  \\"I owe the publisher another book, how can I provide one with the least amount of effort\\". Very disappointing.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome game very additive graphics are outstanding just wish it did not speed up as quickly as it dose but fun none the less and really like having other characters and the power ups are fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is very good.has additing games and fun ones.the only bad thing about this app is that it doesn't give u better directions on how to play the games.
1594745692|5.0|Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said :)<br />This deck is a tarot deck first and foremost.  It does not stray too far from the RWS imagery, but obviously it comes with a zombie twist.  So yes, it is a themed deck but I do not see this as being a novelty deck by any means.  Those who want to stay true to tarot will get a reading from it without being taken out of their comfort zone.  Those who want to bring a sense of fun to their readings, will perhaps see this is a deck that can certainly open the gates to many a tongue in cheek reading.<br /><br />I did a reading today and the recipient was open for a tongue in cheek zombie style.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to plant the tongue in the cheek and type away. Yet when I read back over my ramblings there was still a recognisable serious message underpinning the humour.  I think this deck will be a stayer and will be used when it is appropriate to be a little light hearted.<br /><br />As for the quality of the product, you just cannot beat it.  I mean come on, under $12 for this?  It is worth that and more.  The box is sturdy and is very well made to go with the deck.  Read the small print on the side of the lid to get an idea of what awaits.  Then when you peel off the lid, you see the ammo casings around the side.  It really does resemble a box of ammo.  The small book does only have a small amount of text per card, but it uses 50 words when only 50 are needed if that makes sense.  Besides which, it then allows the reader to expand in their own style without spoonfeeding, or dulling their own intuition.  I loved the wee adverts at the back of the book which of course - are zombie related and again not to be taken seriously.<br /><br />As for the deck, I have heard many people complain about standard of cardstock of modern day decks. They are either too flimsy, too slippery, too small, too big.  The list goes on.  This seems about right to me.  I can hand over hand shuffle, and they arefairly thick so will stand up to the rigours of regular use.  The borders are small, thus leading to good sized card images.  It has a sepia / 1950's feel to it throughout.<br /><br />Would I recommend this?  Yes, to those who are already familiar with the RWS tarot.  You can fall straight into using it out of the box and trust me - you will be itching to do your own zombie style readings :)<br />Those who are new to tarot may find the images are a little too off centre to read straight off the bat so to speak, but it wouldn't take much to get a lot from this deck as a newbie.  The book really does help no end.<br />Even though we are only 6 months into 2012, this may end up being voted as my deck purchase of the year on a certain tarot forum.  It is refreshing, different and does not take itself seriously.
0765316994|5.0|This is probably the funniest book I have ever read.  Scalzi is normally quite funny, but this is by far better than Android's Dream.  Short read because you can't put it down.  Dialog in the book is extraordinary. I cried laughing through most of the book, and actually cried at the end not laughing...he nailed it with this one.
B007IX383I|5.0|My first review, I have not felt such emotions since the Lamb, something so mature and universal, it touches every feeling i have had for the last year.<br />Hats off to Anathema, if it was-sent for customers who bout this, would also like this, i would have never discovered my new GENESIS.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|this game is not addictive at all it is only ghl fun if u play it fir 5 to ten minutes and thenit gets lame I don't no what half the people here r talking about
B0080YGZ20|5.0|Oh my gosh!  What a refreshing change.  I normally do not listen to female singers (mainly because of the overrated scream-singing Beyonce or the no -talent, why are we famous Lady Gaga / Nicki Minaj duo) so it was a joy to listen to someone that is not only a songwriter, but a singer.  The things she can do with her voice.  Reminded me of The Manhattan Transfer on certain songs...Kimbra gave me goosebumps!  (I love Settle Down)<br /><br />Kudos Kimbra...do your thang girl!
B0086700CM|5.0|i would definitely get this app it is awesome, this is one of my favorite game on my kindle, it is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005QPGHQU|2.0|This is by far the weakest and most generic of Evanescence's efforts. There is no variety in vocals or content. The songs feel hollow and without passion and all of them are completely interchangeable. I wasn't the biggest fan of The Open Door, but at least on that album you could actually tell the songs apart. Evanescence's original lineup was what gave this band its true power; this time around, Amy's pretty voice is simply not enough to save this utter trainwreck, and her lyrics are becoming a weakness as they repeat the same old stuff from Fallen and The Open Door. The music no longer feels real, and the band feels to be deader than dead. I'm glad this album is self-titled, because it might as well have been called \\"Your Average Female-Fronted Rock Album.\\" The only truly good song in the entire album is End of the Dream. All other songs range from passable to mediocre. I hope these guys can do better next time.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is an addictive game so be warned u may never put it down.  temple run is the best.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Hello, It is with great sadness that I am sharing this. I have used the Kindle for Android for a couple of years now. I simply loved having all my books at my finger tips where ever I happened to be. The Kindle app has given me the ability to enjoy good books when I am waiting for different thing like my son's sports practice to end. It has been the most used app on my LG Ally phone. However, this latest upgrade will not work on my LG Ally. When ever the Kindle app loads it takes forever and then I continue to get errors, cannot connect to server xyz@amazon. My data usage went through the roof. Easily 3 times my normal months usage in one weekend. One of the 2 times that the app did open and connect the pages took a very long time to advance and then the phone rang which then locked up and I could not answer my call or continue to use the Kindle app. Both times I had to force my phone to turn off. I finally, sadly uninstalled the Kindle app. My provider was gracious and gave me a credit for going over my data plan, thanks Verizon. When my contract allows I will most likely upgrade to a larger capacity phone so that I can once again have my Kindle app. I sure miss it!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is the best game ever. Everyone should play it and learn how to take over large landmasses. I really want to start getting the expansion packs.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great conclusion to the trilogy but at points I found it difficult to keep reading. This is not to say anything bad about the book, just that it was too sad and depressing. Overall, I still give it 5 stars.
B007I2BZIE|2.0|I hear drums, guitar, bass, vocals, but where're the melodies?<br /><br />As a huge Rush fan, I really WANTED to like this album. But after a *lot* of listening, I have to conclude that I don't like it.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me - I don't want to keep listening to the Rush of old. I don't want them to reinvent the 70s or 80s or not explore different styles. Growth and change are all good, but great music is still great music, yes? I mean, it's supposed to transcend time and musical style and all that? Take these great Rush albums - 2112, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, GUP, and Counterparts - they explore different styles from classic rock to prog-rock to synth-rock to grunge, but I love them all. The common thread is that the music is melodious with strong hooks. It does not (and should not) take hundreds of hours of 'careful listening' to appreciate a Rush album.<br /><br />Individually, the guys are still rocking their respective instruments, but what they've created sounds discordant. No amount of incredible technical musicianship can fix that. I think Geddy's voice in the lower registers has really improved in the last decade, but he has not made enough use of it here. He sounds tired and like he's wailing when he tries those high notes. Most of the time, his singing is not sharp enough and sounds aimless.<br /><br />Another point is that I've always liked Peart's lyrics, but unfortunately for Neil, they're meant to work with the music. When the music is this forgettable, I really can't care about the lyrics (or that this is a concept album.)<br /><br />Besides The Garden and maybe Clockwork Angels, the other songs are really weak. This is the first Rush album where the ratio of good songs to filler is this low. There are a couple of other songs that could've been very good (The Wreckers, BU2B) but were spoiled due to an incoherent and rambling midsection (to make them longer, perhaps?)<br /><br />Overall, I am sadly disappointed. Since when is it required to try this hard to like an album, especially a Rush album? I hope their next one (and I do hope they continue to create new music) will be way better.
0061997811|5.0|This book is amazing bought it for my boyfriend for his birthday i had to open it! if you're really into Harry Potter this is a must buy!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case first of all arrived at my house one day early. (I choose two day shipping) And when I opened the package and put it on my kindle I found out that the case would be even more protective than I thought. The case stand also works great! I not only tested it on a flat surface but also my bed various types of pillows and my couch. The stand worked on all of them. And on most I could tap the screen without falling over. So overall this case is fairly protective and a great working stand! I would recommend this case to my friends and family.
B0087YZBMS|5.0|Glad to see Amy kick it out of the ballpark again.  I loved \\"This is the Life\\" and though there were 3 songs I liked on her second Album, it just did not compare to her first.  While I've only listened to this once, I love it.  I can tell that over the next few weeks I will fall in love with many of these songs and will be playing them endlessly.  Amy's a true artist.  I love the electric guitar undertones throughout this album.  Reminds me of some of her live performances.  Thanks Amy for not dishing out a bunch of trash as many other \\"one hit wonders\\" have.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is so much fun!!!!! a lot different from the original Oregon trail but its still fun good twist on an original
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked up this book as a quick read, not thinking much of it. But after getting through the initial short story, I found this to be one of the most entertaining pieces of literature I've ever read. The story is so unique in its perspective, and I found it very difficult to put down. An amazing read for anyone looking for good suspense in a masterfully crafted world
B007L5KT76|1.0|I'm one of those fans who like Sherlock Holmes for the mystery, and the fun of trying to figure the mystery out.  This move had action, violence, and something like a plot.  It felt more like a video game than a Sherlock Holmes story.  This is not a bad thing if you like that kind of movie.  But if you prefer a real challenge of the Holmes sort, I would recommend the BBC series \\"Sherlock\\" for you.  I'm just glad I rented rather than bought.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three of these books were spellbinding!  Once you start reading it's impossible to put down; believe me other things won't get down because you will not be abke to stop reading.  After I read the first, I thought, \\"how could the second and third be any better!\\"  I was wrong; one out did the other.  The story was so well written and the last book wrapped up the sory so well, I especially liked Christen's view of their first meeting at the end of the book.  I am disappointed to read anything else now:)
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I usually resist getting involved in watching series because your life revolves around being home to watch them. With DVD recording systems and DVRs, it is much easier to watch shows on demand. AMC had a marathon on Thanksgiving weekend (2011) and ran all of The Walking Dead ending with the mid-season finale.  I was hooked!  I ordered the complete first season that week.  Love the show!  The conflicts between characters (both living and dead) makes this show great.  Both fortunately and unfortunately, I bought the ultimate edition (with bicycle girl on the cover) while I was visiting my family in Fort Worth, thinking that I would get a better, more expanded experience with the \\"dead.\\"  It was great.  There is more bonus materials that added more \\"meat\\" to the show (the good part).  The bad part was the quirk I found on my copy when I tried to watch all episodes in order. The scene with the \\"guts\\" was deleted! When I watched it again episode by episode, the scene miraclously appeared. Creation of super-expanded versions of the same shows or movies are a common complaint many people have with the company Anchor Bay (distributors of these DVDs). Only ice cream cones should be double dipped (hint: Anchor Bay). Lazy people like me don't like having to hit the play button more than once (LOL).  The \\"walker autopy\\" was a crucial segment to that story line and Anchor Bay was to blame for \\"butchering\\" that episode. A real let down for die-hard fans of the genre. Another thing I found strange was the commentary track with Robert Kirkman and Emma Bell on episode 104 (Vatos).  Kirkman mentioned a conflict with T-Dog actor Irone Singleton.  I'm not sure if the altercation was verbal or physical but judging by how little screen time T-Dog got in Season Two, I got the impression that the conflict wasn't truly resolved.  Many people on the Twitter buzz who have watched Season Two have complained on AMC's website that T-Dog's character has had little if no screen time with one maybetwo lines every other episode.  Some have relagated him to \\"token status.\\"  I wonder if it had anything to do with the conflict.  The character (with beefy actor Irone Singleton) could be written as more of asset to the Grimes Gang.  A real missed opportunity.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Just received my copy of their new CD and it is good, very good.  It is great that they have retained the same feel for harmonies, phrasing and fun that marked their best songs of the '60s.  With the dirth of music that is enjoyable today, this new offering is a welcome find.  It is nice to see them enjoying the acclaimation they deserve.
B0028NSE3M|4.0|This recording brings back great memories.  My uncle in Houston turned my siblings and I on to Issac Hayes album back in 1972. When I saw the 40th anniversary edition, I bought it right away.  I thought it was odd that the original album only had four tracks on it.  I loved the mellow and soulful sound of Hayes' music.  I call it my \\"sitting in the hot tub under the stars with a glass of wine\\" music.  His redition of \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\" is a beautiful word picture of a man hopelessly in love with a woman not worthy of that love. If you love soul music and have a hot tub, I recommend this music.
B001QXCYZY|4.0|I bought the Behringer Studio Condenser C-1U microphone to improve the quality of my home music recording efforts without going to the expense and complication of adding a pre-amp box. The selling point for me was the USB connection which is powered by phantom power directly from the computer.<br /><br />This is a very solid and good-looking piece of gear, heavy and substantial in feel and offering the kind of convenience and low-cost solution I was looking for. It came with an adapter (you'll need to buy a mic stand) and a software CD (mostly obsolete): Juice software for podcasting, Kristal and Audacity for recording and editing (these last two are free software; you can get the latest version of Audacity from the Sourceforge web site.)<br /><br />When I first got the mic (about two years ago), it took me a longish time to achieve acceptable results, the main problem being that the mic is on the quiet side. To produce the flat, quality sound I was hoping for requires all relevant computer settings to be turned up to the maximum. In the course of doing so, I ran into problems with my Realtek Audio Manager but that was quite possibly due to some limitation with my set-up.  What finally worked for me was to separate the input jacks in the Control Panel, Audio Manager (I'm running Windows Vista Home Premium), turn the microphone (input) volume to the maximum in Audacity (having given Audacity control of the mic), and position the mic 5-6 inch from the source (guitar or singer). I then apply amplification and/or normalization to the resulting recorded sound wave. My research indicates that the problem of the low sound is common to other condenser mics of the USB variety, and I have seen suggestions that Vista is not very user-friendly in that respect.<br /><br />Also, when I contacted Behringer, they suggested using Asio4all which is an independent universal audio driver for Windows systems.  For me it made all the difference and I am now very happy with the recording sound quality I get.  Asio4all is free software which (as I understand it) basically improves the way most computer sound cards work.  With my current set-up, I am happy with the sound I am getting, there is no hiss and I love the ease of the USB connection.sound quality I get.

1591391105|1.0|I have taken many online professional developmental classes and read many professional developmental books.  This one is what you call your typical corporate, dry and boring books.  I had a hard time staying interested and focused.  Like some of the other reviews stated, I also felt that this was pretty much more of a change management theory (taking on a different management position within your company, how to prepare and position yourself in a management position working for a different company, leadership management and strategies).<br /><br />The reason why I finished the book is because it was a developmental class required; otherwise I would have not wasted my time finishing the book.<br /><br />I would highly recommend any of the books by Patrick Lencioni.  He has several books out (I have already read 2 and am starting on book #3).  Patrick's books are enjoyable, fast reading and actually engage you with the characters/scenarios as his books are written in a story style to capture your interest/keep your attention.  I really got a lot of ideas and information out of the books that I have read by Patrick Lencioni.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had to see what the hype was about.....and it didn't live up to expectations.  Not sure if this book deserves 2 or 3 stars because there is NO story line other than sex.  It was entertaining enough, but I couldn't see how there could be 2 more books behind this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|E.L. James has written a wonderful story. Please don't let the subject matter deter you or frighten you from reading this book. It is a true love story. You will laugh, cry, and yes it will arouse your innerself, but above all you will fall in love with this couple. The characters are well developed, and the story is so well written. It leaves you wanting more...so much more!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|At least this one had a story line other than sex.  It was entertaining, I read through the sex (that are the same scenes over and over and over) fairly quickly, but was excited that there was more to it.  Wouldn't read it again or necessarily recommend it, but at least it surpassed book one.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|I had heard good things about this movie and read good reviews, so I bought the DVD without having seen the movie prior.  It turns out the reviews were spot on and it was a very enjoyable film.  I was inspired by the design and visuals in ways similar to when I first saw Alien or 2001, and I kinda wish I had gotten the BluRay just so the visuals would be even more stunning.  Regardless, it's not necessarily my favorite movie ever, but definitely good sci-fi and worth picking up.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I have been a Rush fan my whole life. All 22 years of it (and I'm a girl so how is that for being an abnormal fan?). I am so happy to be able to say another great Rush album has come out in my lifetime. Like so many others I have been waiting for this album for a long time and I have already listened to it at least five times today. It gets better with each listen! While it is not another Moving Pictures or 2112 I think that Clockwork Angels is another fine piece of work. I love that Rush continues to hold onto what they are yet still manage to grow as a band at the same time. Their career has spanned over decades and they can still produce quality music. What other bands can truly say that? This album has officially made it into my Rush favorites list. Way to go guys!

B004TIKXCE|5.0|The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote his 'Thoughts' between 170 and 180. Other titles assigned to the same book are: 'Personal Notes', 'Meditations', 'The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius' et al. It is one of the few complete works of a late Stoic philosopher that still exists today. He wrote his 'Thoughts' as personal notes for himself. He writes about solidarity, physical adversity, good and evil, inner freedom and more. 'Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius' is a book full of wisdom that brings comfort and contemplation; it is moving and inspiring. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />This edition was translated by George Long in 1862. The book does contain a biography of Marcus Aurelius. The 'Thoughs' of Marcus Aurelius are grouped in 12 'books' (chapters). The first book is clearly different from the other eleven; it is a 'thank you' to people who have had a good influence on him. For example: 'From my grandfather Verus (I learned) good morals and the government of my temper.' (I.1). The other eleven books contain his notes. His Stoic philosophy emphasizes ethics, especially everyday problems.<br /><br />Some quotations from this book:<br />Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. (II.11)<br />Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor the tranquillity which others give. A man then must stand erect, not be kept erect by others. (III.5)<br />Always run to the short way; and the short way is the natural: accordingly say and do everything in conformity with the soundest reason. For such a purpose frees a man from trouble, and warfare, and all artifice and ostentatious display. (IV.51)
B006MHWXMS|2.0|Got this as the FAOTD and just recently tried to put it to use.  I don't do too many reviews but I just think this one has a lot of potential but its got a few problems. Another reviewer mentioned these but I thought they were worth repeating.  1.  Every time you open the app it asks you if you want to sync.  Why is this necessary EVERY TIME?  2.  Every time you open this app the 2nd thing it does is inform you how to use it.  This really isn't necessary because its just not that complicated.  3.  The third frustrating thing it does is every time you open your lists, it has duplicated all of your lists.  Even after you delete the extra lists the next time you open they will be back.  I finally gave up and uninstalled.  It does seem like the calendar issues have been fixed.  If the other issues were fixed this would IMO be a 5 star app!  (Droid Charge)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved all 3 books.  But for me, it wasn't just about the SEX.  I wanted to learn more about the complexities of the man.  What made him tick, what led him to be who he is.<br /><br />His control over everyone and everything, came from a deep part of him.  I liked seeing him turn his life around some, and accept that there is more to love and life than what he has known.<br /><br />I read the books back to back, just to see when the story would take them.

B007NESBK2|5.0|I pre-ordered this and received it on a Monday, which was one day before it was to be released in the stores. Great job, Amazon! As for the concert, well I went to her LA show and was blown away. Sade is a one-of-a-kind class act. One of my top 2 concerts ever (Jamiroquai is the other). From start to finish, this concert captivated me and the entire audience. I just saw the blu-ray disc last night with a fellow Sade fan. I waited because my surround sound was not hooked up and I wanted to blast the concert, so we watched it at my friend's house. I was not disappointed, and neither was my friend (who did not get to see the live show). This concert DVD was true to the live concert I attended in LA. Sade's voice sounds as great as ever, she's as beautiful as ever, and her performance comes from within. No crazy stage shows with acrobatics, 50 dancers jumping about, pyrotechnics, and the dreaded lip-syncing and autotune. Just Sade and her amazing band. What more do you need or expect? There is some behind-the-scenes footage of the tour, where she gives thanks to all her supporting crew. There's also a nice dance remix of Love Is Found at the end of the DVD. Buy this DVD. You won't be disappointed.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|The long awaited new Rush album is finally here as promised on June 12, a date that became indelible in the hearts of all Rush fans. \\"Clockwork Angles\\" was a title that teased Rushaholics for a long time since the release of the first single, `Caravan'. The picture sleeve of the single depicted the intricate decorative clock and I had thought this would be the cover of the album, however the cover design was released, and I could not help but feel a twinge of disappointment that it was such a simple design, having been used to some more dynamic art on previous album covers over the years. I have since grown used to seeing that iconic red cover with the medieval clock in the swirling turbulent clouds. The simplistic design is memorable and indeed all the artwork in the booklet is incredibly provocative, capturing a steampunk future with dreamy scapes and structures, illustrated by Hugh Syme. There are some breathtaking designs including a spacey look at a blue world with clouds and that giant clock ticking ominously above. Some of the art reminds me of the future fantasy worlds of Myst, such as the beige colour painting of art deco sailing ships in the air over an enormous clock face and there are details of steam emanating from the wheels and cogs of progress. It is a place of dreams and fantasies with characters wandering around such as the peddler in a darkened forest, there is a shipwreck graveyard in stormy seas, two hands reaching for a mystical clock object, sun dials, mysterious enchanted worlds and the everpresent watchmaker icons.  Beautifully realised, the art captures the feel of the album and transports us into the world of the protagonist's journey.<br />The musicianship is brilliant on this album; Peart has stated in interviews that he intended it \\"to be my highest achievement lyrically and drumming wise\\" ([...]). He further went on to say that he took a new approach to writing and recording; \\"I played through each song just a few times on my own, checking out patterns and fills that might work\\" then he called on Nick who became his conductor, \\"and I was his orchestra\\". Peart would attack the drums in order to respond \\"to his enthusiasm, and his suggestions between takes, and together we would hammer out the basic architecture of the part (with) half-time bridges, and double-time outros\\" therefore there was no need for counting, or endless repetition.<br /><br />The concept is strong and takes some comprehensive power to interpret it but the liner notes clearly outline a very intricate and compelling tale that is also told within Peart's thoughtful lyrics. The concept is based on the work of Peart's friend, science fiction novelist extraordinaire Kevin J Anderson, who announced that he would write the \\"Clockwork Angels\\" novel and he related many of the concepts of the novel, involving the forces of order and chaos that inflict themselves upon a young traveller, who dreams of travelling to a steampunk alchemist world of hidden cities. It is a world of piracy, carnivalesque settings and colourful characters such as The Watchmaker, who imposes precision on the lives of the inhabitants, and  the evil Anarchist who desires that precision to be turned to chaos.<br /><br />The tale that has made its way onto this album is concentric around a farm boy who had an idyllic lifestyle with peace and stability but it became too much to take, and ultimately stifled his dreams of exploring what the world offers. It is set in the village of Barrel Arbor, where steamliners descend onto the rails on their way to the Winding Pinion River to Crown City. As the farmer watched these massive machines he longs to escape to live out his dreams.<br /><br />This is where `Caravan' comes in, and after hearing it out of context for so long as the first single unleashed upon the world, it is so refreshing to hear it finally as the opener on the album.  From the first time I heard it I was very taken with the song as it is a heavier Rush than that of recent years, and it sounded vibrant and dynamic with very thought provoking lyrics and excellent musicianship. It begins with atmospheric clanging bells and the sound of machines moving across the hemispheres. The familiar guitar sound of Alex Lifeson cranks up with that powerdriving riff. Then Neil Peart races around his drum kit, then maintains a steady rhythmic figure until a bassline begins, followed by the golden tones of Geddy Lee; this is Rush! The production and mixing of Nick Raskulinecz is exceptional capturing a crystalline sound with all musicians audible including the orchestrations.  The melody of the song is certainly infectious, especially the way the chorus builds to the mantra of the album, \\"I can't stop thinking big.\\" The interlude is grinding guitar and some accomplished fret work. A low key synth drone is heard in the background. The choppy time sig is repeated until a lead break with some incredible string bends to lift up the sound and then back to the chorus. The structure is effective and it is a great way to open proceedings. It is easy to be accustomed to the standard of excellence that Rush maintain from album to album, but occasionally an album simply stands out as being above the rest simply due to strong songwriting and powerful melodies that jam themselves into the brain. \\"Clockwork Angels\\" certainly qualifies in this regard.<br /><br />A transition is heard leading into `BU2B', another song not unknown as it was the B side of the single, but the new intro was a nice touch with reverb vocals and mystical undertones. It was never a song I was immediately taken with as a B side, but on the album it makes more sense, and tells the story admirably that introduces The Watchmaker, who is integral to the concept. This figure ruled from Crown City through the Regulators, and the alchemist-priests had provided coldfire in order for the power and light of this world to be possible.<br /><br />`BU2B' (brought up to believe) concerns the whole concept of belief as a human condition; \\"the universe as a plan, We are only human, It's not ours to understand.\\" The protagonist is expressing that the world in which he exists always has told the occupants to \\"Believe in what we're told, Until our final breath, While our loving Watchmaker, Loves us all to death.\\"<br /><br />`Clockwork Angels' is where the album becomes more than just great, as this is one of the most progressive songs from Rush for years. It is little wonder that Lifeson referred to it as an \\"epic song\\", \\"very dynamic\\" and a \\"multi-parted piece\\" (roadrunnerrecords.com).<br /><br />It begins with a Gregorian Monk chant, setting the scene and then a hovering synth and loud crashing guitars explode. The percussion builds up and it breaks to a pleasant clean guitar phrase and Lee's vocals. He sounds excellent and at times uses multi tracking on his vocals to enhance the tones. The bassline is pulsating along the metrical patterns of Peart. The lyrics follow the deepening storyline, that moves to the bustling city of Chronos Square, where the farmboy finds himself gazing in wonder at the huge formations of the Cathedral of the Timekeepers, massive  sky towers, and the radiant Angels of Land, Sea, Sky  and Light, with the iridescent  floating globes. It is a surreal scene that is captured brilliantly in the artwork. The song is compelling with some dynamic time sig changes and mood shifts. It builds with many variations on the main themes, until the outbreak of the instrumental that is a hammering riff.<br /><br />The \\"synchronised and graceful\\" Clockwork Angels are the creatures that \\"promise every treasure, to the foolish and the wise, Goddesses of mystery, spirits in disguise, Every pleasure, we bow and close our eyes, Clockwork angels, promise every prize.\\"  There is a Biblical pretext based on Proverbs 3:5 \\"Lean not upon your own understanding\\". The people of this fantastical land worship  and adore the Angels and celestial spiritual machinery. The song ends with a quiet whisper and it has been quite a journey with some complex structures with Rush at the top of their game.<br /><br />`The Anarchist' follows with a terrific guitar riff and heavy rhythms. Lee's vocals are more forced and are full of conviction, with some moments that sound processed like a robotic announcer on a PA system. His register is high on verses such as, \\"In all your science of the mind, seeking blind through flesh and bone, Find the blood inside this stone, What I know, I've never shown; what I feel, I've always known, I plan my vengeance on my own, and I was always alone.\\" Again it is a heavy song with a ton of distortion and loud musical soundscape. The interlude is a wonderful lead break with phase effects on guitar that soars heavenly. It is as good as anything I have heard on the best tracks of recent Rush albums. It definitely has a modern sound unlike the 70s years. The lyrics are from the point of view of The Anarchist who shuns the optimistic cry of the Pedlar, \\"What do you like\\" to which he replies, \\"Vengeance!\\"<br /><br />The plot thickens and the next song `The Carnies' augments the atmospheres with a strange intro of carnival sounds and distant voices. The amazing riff locks in and opens one of the metal tracks of the album. It feels heavier with the metal distortion and then the next section breaks into an electronic spacey soundscape. It is certainly one of the highlights of the album, but none of the songs thus far have been less than excellent respectively. It may be one of the strongest first halves of a Rush album since \\"Moving Pictures\\" and \\"Counterparts\\". The lead solo is again absolutely virtuoso as only Lifeson can be, with a different sound but an appropriate feeling to the steampunk theme. This song really grew on me and I love the melody and the overall chord structure, and especially the heavy riffing throughout.<br /><br />The concept was inspired by Peart who was reading about circus settings in Robertson Davies' novels. The story continues that the farmer finds work at a carnival beneath the ever watching angels, where \\"Bodies spin in a clockwork dance, The smell of flint and steel, A wheel of fate, a game of chance.\\"  He sees the Anarchist holding a clockwork detonator, and he hurls it but the farmboy catches it just in time saving all the onlookers at the carnival. However, the \\"ticking box, in the hand of the innocent,\\" causes the angry crowd to move \\"toward him with bad intent.\\"<br /><br />`Halo Effect' is the first time the band are able to settle into a serene tranquil atmosphere. An angelic howl, and wind blowing lead to acoustics and gentle vocals that whisper on the wind. Lee sounds flawless and emotional on this ballad that has really grown on me finally. It builds like a power ballad but this is not `Closer to the Heart; the sound is modernist and has a heartfelt feeling. The sound reflects the story that involves the protagonist falling in love with a carnival performer, acrobat dancer. He pursues her, and then after a fling she rejects and holds contempt towards him. It is an illusionary lover, \\"A goddess, with wings on her heels\\", but the real girl was not \\"the ideal, that I wanted to see.\\" The song is very thoughtful and has a lovely melodic style. The dreaminess of the song works well to break up the intensity of previous heavier tracks. I look forward to hearing this song now on every listen.<br /><br />`Seven Cities of Gold' is another masterful track opening with powerful bassline and dark lead guitar string bends that echo and slice with serrations on a knife edge. The `Working Man' style riff soon cranks up that drives this powerhouse track. The riff reminds me of vintage 70s Rush which is a sheer delight. It has a sensational chorus that builds with innovative chord changes. The time sig even has a progressive feel that skips a beat here and there. The lead solo is more of the guitar serrations and high pitched string bends, that add to an ominous atmosphere. It has an infectious melody and again is one that is bound to grow on the listener.<br /><br />Peart explains, \\"I'd read a lot of history from the south-western part of the US and that figured into the story of the explorer Coronado, who kept going out into the desert to find the fabled cities of gold\\" (Classic Rock). The plot of the album gets into the historical legendary story that fascinates the protagonist. The Legend is that there was a land hiding the seven cities of gold and the only way to them was on the steamliners across the Western Sea. The protagonist bravely crossed to Poseidon, a port city, to work on the steamliners serving the alchemy mines, and onto Redrock Desert with its stone monuments. The traveller eventually set out on a quest to find the infamous city of gold, Cibola. These legends were part of the man's dreams as the lyrics tell; \\"Glowing in my dreams, like hallucinations, Glitter in the sun like a revelation, Distant as a comet or a constellation.\\"<br />The lyrics of this song are superb with mystical imagery such as the desolate landscapes of the fantasy world; \\"Canyons and cactus, Endless and trackless, Searching through grim eternity, Sculptured by prehistoric sea.\\" Overall, a wonderful track with esoteric imagery conjuring up the Rushian scapes and mystique of \\"2112\\", where any minute one might expect to see the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx turn up on the scene. Dare I say that this is one of the most brilliant tracks of Rush for decades.<br /><br />`The Wreckers' was once one of the weaker efforts of the album, though I always thought still had a nice rocking energy. It was not initially as captivating as the other songs thus far so it was one of the more pedestrian songs for me even after many listens. However, this too grew on me eventually and after my 9th listen I finally succumbed to its wonderful chorus melodies and sweeping orchestrations. The storyline is more compelling though concerning a narrow escape from the frozen dessert with the protagonist making his way half dead to Poseidon aboard a ship. A storm breaks out but a beacon of light helps navigate them from danger; \\"a ghostly light, Appears through the driving rain, Salvation in human chain.\\" Unfortunately, the signal is false to lure seafarers to crash on the rocks. Once the wreck occurred the crew would be plundered of their cargo; these were The Wreckers. Peart explains his inspiration; \\"The Wreckers was actually from Daphne Du Maurier, that's been in my mind for 30 years. I guess it's an episode in Jamaica Inn. So all of that coalesced into the character and the history of the story, the whole concept.\\"<br /><br />The lyrics state the warning in a cryptic manner; \\"All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, Of a miracle too good to be true, All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary, Everything in life you thought you knew.\\" Of course if you were unaware of the concept story you could interpret these words as part of coping with the trials of life, something that Peart is very familiar with having lost his wife and daughter in recent times in the same year.<br /><br />The next track is an instant masterpiece, one that I have heard many times prior to this release being the second and far more superior single of the album. `Headlong Flight' has a glorious riff and melodic line. Lee's wandering bassline is outstanding and the percussion is Peart at his most frenetic as he chases his cymbals and skins around like a maniac. The main riff is lifted from the glory of `Bastille Day' and that has caused some controversy among fans, but for me there is nothing wrong with returning to the vintage sound if it works and is reinvented to provide something very special. Peart has actually stated that he hopes that song will be in their setlist for live performances indefinitely; \\"What was it that Oscar Wilde said: self-plagiarism is style?\\" He believes that \\"We certainly do a few tongue-in-cheek nodsto Bastille Day in `Headlong Flight' - that's deliberate,\\" so when we fans recognise it, that is a compliment to the band who want us to do precisely that.<br /><br />The speed of the track is quite breathtaking and Lee sounds absolutely full of passion and drive; \\"All the journeys of this great adventure, It didn't always feel that way, I wouldn't trade them because I made them, The best I could, and that's enough to say.\\" The song builds to the chorus that changes time sig into a beautiful melodic moderate feel. As soon as I heard the melody of the chorus and the lyrics I was mesmirised; as chills went down the spine, when Lee sings; \\"I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels, Steered the airship right across the stars, I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel, Oh I wish that I could live it all again.\\" Amidst that fantastic melody hides a story of airships, turning cogs and wheels and machinery that now makes perfect sense amidst the rest of the conceptual material. The song has even more power on the album and comes in at the perfect moment when things were beginning to become too easy on the ears. The frenetic pace and intensity of this track makes this stand out as a magical moment of the album. The way the song changes seamlessly from a fast tempo to the half time feel is a master touch. This is Rush at their most adventurous and heaviest after a long hiatus and 20 albums. The lyrics are poetic beauty put to music that resonate so powerfully in my spirit.<br />Lee's high register vocals are everpresent and he has not sounded this good for years. In the half time section there is an instrumental that has some fast Peart drum fills and deliciously delirious axework from Lifeson. The band are in full flight and one can tell they are enjoying their golden years rocking as hard as ever; you have to be inspired by their energy and commitment to excel. Lifeson incorporates wah-wah pedals, with hyper fast picking and is like a tiger loosed from its cage; a far cry from his lead work on the past few albums.<br /><br />The words could be taken in any way you want outside of the actual storyline; \\"Some days were dark, I wish that I could live it all again, Some nights were bright, I wish that I could live it all again.\\" The highs and lows of life are captured perfectly here. In context of the album, the protagonist is thinking over all the great adventures and quotes the great alchemist, Friedrich Gruber, \\"I wish I could do it all again.\\" He has steered the great airships across the stars and travelled to cities of gold, so he fondly remembers the adventures without regrets; one of the most optimistic moments of the album.<br /><br />The pedlar returns and asks \\"what do you lack\\" again and the protagonist considers how he was \\"brought up to believe\\", and \\"no philosophy consoles me in a clockwork universe\\". The tone turns to a pessimism with the man pondering over the pedlar's words, so he loses faith in higher powers, remembers the pain, dwells on the illusion of love. He holds onto the belief that love conquers over all the rejection of the past because that is the way he was brought up; to believe. This song is a melancholy short passage of orchestral music, consisting of symphonic strings, conducted by David Campbell. The strings have also appeared on `Halo Effect', `The Anarchist', and `The Wreckers', but on `BU2B2' they are prominent and quite daring. The lyrics are downbeat and gloomy; \\"Belief has failed me now, the bright glow of optimism has failed me somehow, life goes from bad to worse.\\" This may not appeal to many, it is easily the worst track of the album, but as a diversion for the album as a whole it works, and I count it as more of a transition into the next masterful track. If taken out of context this track is a morbid downbeat filler, but I still love the way it transforms the atmosphere after the bright vibrant uptempo rock of previous tracks. It is the diversity that makes the impact rather than taken on its own. This is a veritable fish out of water but the album would not be complete without these oddball moments and transitions.<br /><br />`Wish Them Well' is another outstanding track that grabbed me the first time I heard it. The loud guitar and pounding drum is augmented by very melodic vocals that are back to a more hopeful resonance; \\"All that you can do is wish them well.\\" The hook is catchy and it leads to some wonderful verses. I especially love the multi tracked harmonies on the section; \\"Thank your stars you're not that way, Turn your back and walk away, Don't even pause and ask them why, Turn around and say goodbye.\\" I grew to love this song over a few listens, it just jumps out at me and prepares for the epic to end the album. The lead break is stellar playing with emotive bending, speed picking and arpeggios. There is a strong harmony in the refrain too, and the words impact my spirit; \\"The ones who've done you wrong, The ones who pretended to be so strong, The grudges you've held for so long, It's not worth singing that same sad song.\\" This is about dealing with our demons that is essential to our wellbeing, and Rush have a lot to say about how we must learn to move on even when we are going through trials, \\"just wish them well.\\"<br />In context of the storyline, the protagonist has come to terms with his life, even after feeling victimised and defeated. He reasons that it is not worth holding grudges as it is just burning him up like coals on his heart. The best response is to avoid the ones that hurt him and simply wish them well. Now I can relate to this in my own personal journey. Peart has really hit the nail on the head here and it is spiritually uplifting to hear this song with these thoughts in mind. I have seen how people have become scarred over the words of others and hurtful actions and it is all because they hold onto grudges and refuse to let go. It is only when we choose to let go that we can truly be free from condemnation and the curse of rejection. It is a choice and if we remember that we can choose to not allow the defamation of others to scar our character. Thank you, Rush for reminding us of these valuable important lessons.<br /><br />The lessons continue and culminate in the next wonderful epic song `The Garden'. It begins with tranquil beautiful acoustics and a violin, and ends with a sweeping majestic orchestral soundscape and soaring melodies that are soothing to the soul. The music includes a gorgeous piano interlude by Jason Sniderman. The lyrics are some of Rush's most powerful and uplifting to the spirit.  The protagonist muses on his life and finds that ray of hope he had been searching for; \\"The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect, So hard to earn, so easily burned, In the fullness of time, A garden to nurture and protect\\". The hopeful lyrics are reflected in the way that the music builds to a crescendo and it really feels like the ending of an epic journey. There is a sadness in the atmosphere but it is a relaxing beautiful mood generated. There is a hint of remorse that the journey is over but the protagonist, who has experienced a bildungsroman quest, has learnt all the valuable lessons of life and nothing more needs to be said; his life is complete having learned that the measure of love and respect is integral. \\"The arrow flies while you breathe, the hours tick away, the cells tick away, The Watchmaker has time up his sleeve,\\" continues the lyrics, stating the case for all of us who only have so much time in which to make life count so we must make the most of it before time runs out. These are simplistic ideas but they are conveyed with poetic resonance and it all ends on this ray of hope; \\"The future disappears into memory, With only a moment between, Forever dwells in that moment, Hope is what remains to be seen.\\" The album concludes on this hope with sweeping symphonic soundscapes that pour out of the speakers, embedding the album upon ourconscious.<br /><br />This is an unforgettable album that took some time to grow on me but once it became engrained in my spirit I was totally captivated under its powerful hold. It could easily pass by without fanfare on a casual listen by the average music listener disinterested in understanding the concept or the lyrics. Furthermore, if one does not relate to the lyrics and interprets them as just some fantasy world out of reach, it is possible that this could become rather incomprehensible. The lyrics are deep, perhaps as deep as anything Peart has written, but he has a lot to say about the emotional rollercoaster of existence, faith, love, respect, freedom, resilience, defeat and the purpose of our lives. None of this comes off as convoluted or pretentious in any way; there is a definite conviction in this work and it is trying to say something important to us that we can take with us into our own circumstances. The music itself is a mesmirising virtuoso augmentation and this is embellished with symphony orchestra strings and ethereal atmospherics. It transports us directly into the fantasy worlds and becomes a full sensory experience; aurally with the music and visually tangible thanks to the artwork, liner notes with story lines, and of course the lyrics.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is Rush back to their absolute best after some rather forgettable albums and straight forward rock releases. \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is almost the perfect concept album, where everything works to become a coherent whole with masterful song structures and music literally dripping with innovation. It has been a long time since I have heard a masterpiece album from Rush; I would have to go back to 1981's \\"Moving Pictures\\" to find a 5 star album in my opinion. However folks, finally Rush have produced a masterpiece with their new inimitable mature sound. It is far superior to anything from the catalogue of albums from 1985 - 1991. It is marginally better than \\"Counterparts\\", that had a weaker second half after a brilliant first half. The difference with \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is that the whole album is consistent in terms of strong musicianship and infectious melodies with powerhouse lyrical content, and that is not something I can say for the rather patchy material of \\"Test For Echo\\" or Vapor Trails\\". And again it is better than \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" that had some ordinary tracks marring an otherwise excellent album. To state that this new album measures up to the glory days of \\"A Farewell to Kings\\", \\"Hemispheres\\", \\"Permanent Waves\\" or \\"Moving Pictures\\" is perhaps stretching the credibility too far. However, this is still the best Rush album for decades and deserves accolades and high recommendation, therefore ultimately a masterpiece status for all the reasons stated. I did not expect it to stand up to my rather high expectations, we Rush fans are rather demanding, but I am absolutely delighted to announce that this album is a tour de force that lives up to the hype, and is an exceptional treasure from start to end. So far, I hail it as album of the year!cape from the frozen dessert with the protagonist making his way half dead to Poseidon aboard a ship. A storm breaks out but a beacon of light helps navigate them from danger; \\"a ghostly light, Appears through the driving rain, Salvation in human chain.\\" Unfortunately, the signal is false to lure seafarers to crash on the rocks. Once the wreck occurred the crew would be plundered of their cargo; these were The Wreckers. Peart explains his inspiration; \\"The Wreckers was actually from Daphne Du Maurier, that's been in my mind for 30 years. I guess it's an episode in Jamaica Inn. So all of that coalesced into the character and the history of the story, the whole concept.\\"<br /><br />The lyrics state the warning in a cryptic manner; \\"All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary, Of a miracle too good to be true, All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary, Everything in life you thought you knew.\\" Of course if you were unaware of the concept story you could interpret these words as part of coping with the trials of life, something that Peart is very familiar with having lost his wife and daughter in recent times in the same year.<br /><br />The next track is an instant masterpiece, one that I have heard many times prior to this release being the second and far more superior single of the album. `Headlong Flight' has a glorious riff and melodic line. Lee's wandering bassline is outstanding and the percussion is Peart at his most frenetic as he chases his cymbals and skins around like a maniac. The main riff is lifted from the glory of `Bastille Day' and that has caused some controversy among fans, but for me there is nothing wrong with returning to the vintage sound if it works and is reinvented to provide something very special. Peart has actually stated that he hopes that song will be in their setlist for live performances indefinitely; \\"What was it that Oscar Wilde said: self-plagiarism is style?\\" He believes that \\"We certainly do a few tongue-in-cheek nodsto Bastille Day in `Headlong Flight' - that's deliberate,\\" so when we fans recognise it, that is a compliment to the band who want us to do precisely that.<br /><br />The speed of the track is quite breathtaking and Lee sounds absolutely full of passion and drive; \\"All the journeys of this great adventure, It didn't always feel that way, I wouldn't trade them because I made them, The best I could, and that's enough to say.\\" The song builds to the chorus that changes time sig into a beautiful melodic moderate feel. As soon as I heard the melody of the chorus and the lyrics I was mesmirised; as chills went down the spine, when Lee sings; \\"I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels, Steered the airship right across the stars, I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel, Oh I wish that I could live it all again.\\" Amidst that fantastic melody hides a story of airships, turning cogs and wheels and machinery that now makes perfect sense amidst the rest of the conceptual material. The song has even more power on the album and comes in at the perfect moment when things were beginning to become too easy on the ears. The frenetic pace and intensity of this track makes this stand out as a magical moment of the album. The way the song changes seamlessly from a fast tempo to the half time feel is a master touch. This is Rush at their most adventurous and heaviest after a long hiatus and 20 albums. The lyrics are poetic beauty put to music that resonate so powerfully in my spirit.<br />Lee's high register vocals are everpresent and he has not sounded this good for years. In the half time section there is an instrumental that has some fast Peart drum fills and deliciously delirious axework from Lifeson. The band are in full flight and one can tell they are enjoying their golden years rocking as hard as ever; you have to be inspired by their energy and commitment to excel. Lifeson incorporates wah-wah pedals, with hyper fast picking and is like a tiger loosed fromits cage; a far cry from his lead work on the past few albums.<br /><br />The words could be taken in any way you want outside of the actual storyline; \\"Some days were dark, I wish that I could live it all again, Some nights were bright, I wish that I could live it all again.\\" The highs and lows of life are captured perfectly here. In context of the album, the protagonist is thinking over all the great adventures and quotes the great alchemist, Friedrich Gruber, \\"I wish I could do it all again.\\" He has steered the great airships across the stars and travelled to cities of gold, so he fondly remembers the adventures without regrets; one of the most optimistic moments of the album.<br /><br />The pedlar returns and asks \\"what do you lack\\" again and the protagonist considers how he was \\"brought up to believe\\", and \\"no philosophy consoles me in a clockwork universe\\". The tone turns to a pessimism with the man pondering over the pedlar's words, so he loses faith in higher powers, remembers the pain, dwells on the illusion of love. He holds onto the belief that love conquers over all the rejection of the past because that is the way he was brought up; to believe. This song is a melancholy short passage of orchestral music, consisting of symphonic strings, conducted by David Campbell. The strings have also appeared on `Halo Effect', `The Anarchist', and `The Wreckers', but on `BU2B2' they are prominent and quite daring. The lyrics are downbeat and gloomy; \\"Belief has failed me now, the bright glow of optimism has failed me somehow, life goes from bad to worse.\\" This may not appeal to many, it is easily the worst track of the album, but as a diversion for the album as a whole it works, and I count it as more of a transition into the next masterful track. If taken out of context this track is a morbid downbeat filler, but I still love the way it transforms the atmosphere after the bright vibrant uptempo rock of previous tracks. It is the diversity that makes the impact rather than taken on its own. This is a veritable fish out of water but the album would not be complete without these oddball moments and transitions.<br /><br />`Wish Them Well' is another outstanding track that grabbed me the first time I heard it. The loud guitar and pounding drum is augmented by very melodic vocals that are back to a more hopeful resonance; \\"All that you can do is wish them well.\\" The hook is catchy and it leads to some wonderful verses. I especially love the multi tracked harmonies on the section; \\"Thank your stars you're not that way, Turn your back and walk away, Don't even pause and ask them why, Turn around and say goodbye.\\" I grew to love this song over a few listens, it just jumps out at me and prepares for the epic to end the album. The lead break is stellar playing with emotive bending, speed picking and arpeggios. There is a strong harmony in the refrain too, and the words impact my spirit; \\"The ones who've done you wrong, The ones who pretended to be so strong, The grudges you've held for so long, It's not worth singing that same sad song.\\" This is about dealing with our demons that is essential to our wellbeing, and Rush have a lot to say about how we must learn to move on even when we are going through trials, \\"just wish them well.\\"<br />In context of the storyline, the protagonist has come to terms with his life, even after feeling victimised and defeated. He reasons that it is not worth holding grudges as it is just burning him up like coals on his heart. The best response is to avoid the ones that hurt him and simply wish them well. Now I can relate to this in my own personal journey. Peart has really hit the nail on the head here and it is spiritually uplifting to hear this song with these thoughts in mind. I have seen how people have become scarred over the words of others and hurtful actions and it is all because they hold onto grudges and refuse to let go.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|My journey with the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy continues with this installment Fifty Shades Darker. There really is no subtext is there-- the main character says \\"Fifty shades\\" about every 10 pages. It could become a drinking game.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Darker by E. L. James picks up where the first one left off. Ana has decided after the climax (no pun intended) of the last book, that Christian is too dark, twisted and obsessed for her, and so she decides to leave him. I only wonder why it took her so long. Likely the strongest part of this book is that we finally get introduced to several new characters, all who are way more interesting than Christian and Ana. There's the enigmatic Mrs. Robinson, and an ex-sub Leila, and the delightful and much sexier Ethan, brother of best friend Kate.<br /><br />I'll admit, I was so tired of the sex scenes from the first one, I felt that I had seen enough to skip over the ones in this book. I have no problem with sex scenes, but it was almost as if James used the cut and paste feature of Word. Ana has become a much whinier character (and to be fair, so does the Twilight's Bella) and there is an attempt to make Christian less despicable as a character. The ploy is to introduce another character even worse than Christian. I almost laughed because this move was so transparent.<br /><br />You may ask, why did this book earn three stars in that case. Like I said above, the new characters were interesting, and I want to know where James is going with them. Sadly, I'm pretty sure that since we didn't see Ethan until more than halfway through this book, there is no chance for an Ana/Ethan pairing. That said, the likely girl that will end up with Ethan is much more stable and honestly, much better than Ana. And the one other thing that elevated this book from 2 star status was the deliciously satisfying and inevitable confrontation between Mrs. Robinson and Ana. The ending was trite and easily deduced from previous hints.<br /><br />This all said, I'll be reading the third book anyway, because regardless of all of its flaws, it is some of the most addictive fanfic I've seen. But I'll return it as soon as it's done.<br /><br />Ensconced in YA blog: cahreviews.blogspot.com/This all said, I'll be reading the third book anyway, because regardless of all of its flaws, it is some of the most addictive fanfic I've seen.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book just isn't as good as the first one but still captivating. Keeps you wanting to read more. Plus if you don't read this book and you go to read the third in the series you'll most likely be lost.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I am freed. Yes, pun fully intended. This Fifty Shades journey is finally over, and I am greatly relieved.<br /><br />This is by far the worst book of the three. Ana and Christian get married, I think, in the beginning of the book, but it is so poorly written and shifts in time between past and present so quickly that it's hard to tell. Whether it's dream or real initially, I barely cared.<br /><br />Do these characters ever work? Supposedly Ana is good at her job, but she's never there because she's having sex with Christian all the time or emailing him about the sex they are going to have. Do they have anything in common, actually? This was never clear. We know that Ana is into fixing broken people, so I guess that's why they are together. But I wonder how long she's going to put up with his nonsense and overbearing attitude.<br /><br />The spark of interest I had from the development of supporting characters in the second book has vanished in the start of the third, since unfortunately, the first half is fully focused on the two most boring characters-- Christian and Ana. My skimming reached an all time high. The one high point, for me, was the moment with Leila. Then we are back the Ana/Christian fest. Too bad.<br /><br />Did anyone else notice that this was likely one long fan fic and split into three books to garner more money? James is undoubtedly rich at this point from the sheer number of ratings/reviews by people. There are short, sloppy chapters pasted on the beginning and end of second book and again in the third. I would have preferred these to be left off to at least pretend to build some suspense. But after the one page ending of the second book, I knew who the bad guy was. Big disappointment.<br /><br />And what about the continued repetitive phrasing? If I hear \\"Fifty,\\" \\"Holy *^&%,\\" \\"Oh\\" in italics, \\"Oh my,\\" in italics, you catch my drift, I.Am.Going.To.Lose.It. (Yes, I'm tired of the staccato phrasing as well).<br /><br />The ending was cheesy and a little disturbing (SPOILER ALERT: was anyone else really disturbed when Ana and Christian lick the Popsicle off of their son's hands in the same way they've done countless times to each other??). But it's done, and I got through it all.<br /><br />Now, I can gleefully talk about how awful it is in gory detail with all of my friends. Yes, that is why I gave the first review the bonus star.<br /><br />Ensconced in YA blog: cahreviews.blogspot.coma little disturbing (SPOILER ALERT: was anyone else really disturbed when Ana and Christian lick the Popsicle off of their son's hands in the same way they've done countless times to each other??).
