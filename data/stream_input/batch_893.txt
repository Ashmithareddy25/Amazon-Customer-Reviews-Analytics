B001FB4W0W|5.0|My friend introduced me to the books and I've read them all thus far. She was raving about the TV series so I caved and watched the first episode with her and then I got hooked. I love the series just as much as the books; I'm glad that they gave the secondary characters (Sam, Tara, etc.) their own storyline in the TV series.
1594201927|5.0|Refreshing, insightful, humorous perspective coming from a European rather than the typically isolated view of most Americans (The Giant Island Province). It turns out that the economic boom and bust phenomenon has been going on for centuries (John Law, France!) and the basic idea of leverage, credit, bonds, paper money, stock, is, to a large extent, integral with the development of the American colonies. The current \\"crisis\\" caused by the sub prime mortgage mess + the securitization of debt, leveraged insurance vehicles, derivatives, are nothing new . . . we all need to read more history. We were suckers, ask Allan Greenspan (taken in by Ayan Rand \\"Objectivism\\")! Hook, line and sinker. Gulp!
0805208720|4.0|[[ASIN:B0012GUI08 THE CASTLE by Franz Kafka (Hardcover Definitive Edition)]]<br />The Castle<br /><br />I found it interesting to read the customer reviews of Kafka's \\"The Castle.\\" It is obvious that there are no clear answers to what the book \\"means.\\" Is it an analogy to modern, impersonal society; a condemnation of bureaucracy; a search for salvation; a quest for enlightenment over ignorance? The protagonist, \\"K\\", is a land-surveyor, purportedly retained by The Authorities to do some work.  But what he is supposed to do is never made clear.  He needs to meet with The Director, but somehow can never make contact with him.  Along the way, he meets a number of characters --- The Mayor, The Barmaid, various assistants - all of whom present their view of reality. I can see The Castle as an existentialist play, perhaps by Pirandello or Brecht, or even Beckett.  There is virtually no plot, and very little in the way of character development.  The work ends in mid- sentence, suspended in time and space.  The Castle itself is both a literal stone-and-mortar structure and a metaphor for impersonal authority...perhaps even a Dante-esque representation of hell.<br />It is probably helpful to consider \\"The Castle\\" in its historical and social context: the decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and end of the Hapsburg Dynasty, and the threshold of World War. So \\"K\\" is Modern Man: alienated, alone, disaffected, consumed with angst and ennui.
B001PR0Y5S|4.0|I am not a big Ryan Reynolds fan.  Prior to THE PROPOSAL, I  had never seen anything he'd done before that left any kind of impression on me.  My wife was the same way...\\"have we seen him in anything before?\\"  Bland (even wooden), usually in dreadful films like WAITING, or in utterly forgettable roles such as in WOLVERINE.      Sandra Bullock is a past-master of the romantic comedy.  She can give \\"smart*ss\\" and she can do \\"sweet\\" in the same movie.  She doesn't really create believable people as much as delightful screen personas.  Lately, though, she's clearly been fighting her age...trying to pull off roles that were too \\"young\\" for her.  I don't know if it's her or her plastic surgery, but she has tended to mostly look vaguely angry...and her makeup is usually VERY harsh these days.    So I was primed not to care very much for THE PROPOSAL.  And as a whole, it is a very predictable, by-the-numbers romantic comedy of the \\"they hate each other right up until the last second\\" ilk.  But there were just a few scenes that popped with excellent timing, set-up and execution that had me laughing hard...so despite my better inclinations, I'm actually giving this movie a fairly solid recommendation.  For what it attempts and accomplishes.    If you haven't seen the trailer:  Bullock plays a tough-as-nails book editor who has no life beyond work.  She is feared by everyone in the office, because she is ruthless and apparently very good.  She also bullies her assistant (Reynolds), making him work nights & weekends, and forcing him to run all kinds of errands that are certainly beneath his title.  One day, this Canadian finds that she has been ignoring her immigration attorney for too long, and she is about to be deported.  She will lose her position (for a year) to a man she just fired.  Just as she is absorbing this news, in walks Reynolds.  And Bullock hits upon the brilliant idea to announce to her bosses that she and Reynolds are about to be married, thus securing her place in the US.    INS is understandably skeptical, so for reasons that  really don't make a lot of sense, Bullock & Reynolds feel they must immediately fly to Alaska to meet Reynolds' family and old friends.  It's the typical \\"fish out of water\\" scenario, with Bullock trying to walk in stiletto heels through a tiny Alaskan fishing town.  Or trying to cope with her fear of boats.  Or trying to get along with the family dog when she hates dogs.  NO surprises.  The plot chugs along predictably to an ending that doesn't surprise at all.    Yet, as I said, this film has its wonderful comic moments.  In fact, what may be the best scene comes fairly early.  When Bullock announces her intent to marry Reynolds, he has had no time to prepare.  It hits him by surprise.  And his reaction shots are perfect.  He knows that everyone is in on something, and that he must cover as best he can.  Yet he also has a glimmer of the ridiculous notion Bullock has just tossed on him...that they are in love and engaged.  He's mortified, but wants to be professional.  He wants to deny it, but instinct tells him not to thwart his terrifying boss.  I can't adequately describe it...somehow, Reynolds had a moment  heretofore unachieved by him as a performer.  It's enough to make you like his character from that point on.    Other moments nearly as good pop up from time to time.  When the two  have an unwanted \\"nude collision.\\"  A silly incident with Bullock, the dog, an eagle and a cell phone!      The movie has the required \\"serious\\" moments too, such as when we discover why Bullock is so uptight and unfriendly.  These scenes only work because the two stars have earned our goodwill in the comedic scenes...otherwise the somber moments would be unbearable.    The supporting cast is mostly window-dressing.  Poor Mary Steenburgen, who is a great actress, is relegated yet again to an unfunny role as \\"mother.\\"  Craig T. Nelson looks like a coach  gone to seed, and isn't very happy about it, as \\"father.\\"Malin Ackerman (WATCHMEN) has a thankless role as a former girlfriend.  Oscar Nunez (TV's \\"The Office\\") shows up in a crazy role (I won't spoil what it is) that gets some laughs, but in tone, belongs to another film. But the remarkable Betty White is there to shake things up as Reynolds' grandmother.   She's playing a character too over-the-top to be convincing...but she does it with such comic verve that you can't help but like her.  She's 87 years old (doesn't look it at all) and has not lost one moment of her comic timing.   Whoever had the idea to cast her should get 25% of the profits of this film! (On the other end of the spectrum is Denis O'Hare, usually a reliable character actor in both dramas and comedies, who shows up as the suspicious INS agent...and brings a tin ear to his dialogue that makes virtually every utterance supremely unfunny.  He's trying to make a part that doesn't actually have any laughs into something it is not.)    It was amusing that the movie takes place mostly in Alaska.  It was certainly a beautiful location, but you have to think that the driving decision behind that somehow relates to the attention Sarah Palin brought to the state.  Can't you just see a bunch of \\"suits\\" patting themselves on the back for their timeliness?    In the end, THE PROPOSAL is a predictable romantic comedy.  I enjoyed myself, and I can even envision watching the film again some day on DVD with my daughter and her friends, perhaps.  It doesn't make me put Reynolds on my list of favorites...but he sure scored a lot of points with me.  Bullock gets a reprieve.  Betty White gets an MVP award.  And I got to laugh a lot more than I would have expected.  I think for the cliché heavy genre that it's in...I must actually give the film 4 stars!!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I am so glad that the books have been carried over to tv, especially HBO. This was literally just book one with a lot of additional subplots involving the brother and his sexcapades. Interesting but sometimes too much! Still loved the first season and can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD.
0316017922|5.0|I loved reading Gladwell's Outliers. It's been a while since I have enjoyed a book so much from start to end. I had liked The Tipping Point, but Outliers was much more entertaining. In this book, Gladwell does not discredit ability, and certainly credits the importance of hard work, but he writes this book to show how good luck is also an important ingredient to success at the top level. Outliers provides great food for thought and discussion, even if you don't agree with every conclusion. I think that the author did a great job at weaving together facts to arrive at his conclusions. Each of the stories is well told, making this non-fiction at its most engaging. My wife does not have to read this, though, because I couldn't help but tell her nearly every story. Outliers is pure fun for the thinking person.

B00204AA0O|5.0|This is a fantistic album. I am a great fan of Regina's. I have every one of her albums and i am proud to say that she is one of the best voices and talents i have heard in a VERY long time, probably ever. She is so imaginative and poetic. This album was definitely not a disappointment. All of the songs have her very gently and enjoyable voice with very, extremely good lyricism. Heck. They are poems that she sings. Her flavor from her old anti-folk and raw roots are still there. The contradiction of her music is still there, which i love. There are no more jazz influences in this album, or her later ones, but they are still different, and good.    Some of my favorites on this album are Eet, Folding Chair, Dance Theme of the 80's, The Calculation, and Blue Lips. All of them are very good. But those are my personal favorites. If you are a long time lover of Regina's music then GET THIS ALBUM NOW! You are missing out. And to the people that are fans of Begin To Hope. GET THIS ALBUM NOW! Everyone. GET THIS ALBUM NOW!
B000VWYJ86|4.0|In an attempt to unify the Bourne enterprise despite changes in directors, and inevitable seismic changes in production personnel and location, the sense of chronological time is manipulated and we are deliberately, artfully confused.  That in itself is part of the entertainment or diversion within the film; that is, we the audience are challenged to attempt to ascertain our actual place in time and space within this super-fast, super-complex movie.    The strategy of using directorial style to hype suspense works.  Creative Personnel change does not distract any more than scenhe location does.  By the time Bourne's fractured mind re-knits, we not only understand that unprincipled villains of his nation's secret police stripped his humanity from him by means of torture -- water torture and electro-shock torture -- we experience it and glimpse it too, as he re-experiences it through memory's renaissance.    What gives ULTIMATUM it's particular appeal is the fact that the \\"chase\\" takes place in a kind of parallel reality that could only exist within the matrix of international electronic surveillance and multi-national secrecy.  That lethal Secrecy -- an entity made up of thousands of arbitrary, invisible parts -- stalks human beings through the undergrowth of actual or analog reality much as the non-earthly Predator (from the film of the same name) hunted men, while cloaked in electronic camouflage that confused it's victims.    This anti-fantastic film is so good on so many levels it challenges one on all of them and in different ways too.  We come to dread and to loathe Langley much as we came to despise the dungeons of Richelieu.  In making the BOURNE series, the producer or producers have met the challenges posed by the successful completion of previous episodes by fashioning even more compelling stories.  What an amazing piece of work, overall.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|Hate is a strong word. I just haven't ever liked any of his films. Something about the script is always too overdrawn and difficult for me to follow and believe. I've seen Snatch, Lock Stock and a few more. They all sucked I thought. RocknRolla on the other hand kept me awake 2 hours when I was supposed to sleep. It has some great performances and over a dozen characters. Nothing ground-breaking here but just a very entertaining guy flick. Well worth your time. I thought about giving five stars but then I I'm not a liar. Do watch this film. It's the best I've seen from the director.
B00278U1WA|4.0|For those who've gotten to know Regina's music over the past few years, \\"Far\\" will not disappoint.  Some songs offer thoughtful lyrics; others, a catchy chorus with trademark Regina vocals.  It's true, this album definitely has a clean-cut studio sound, which is a sharp contrast to \\"Soviet Kitsch.\\"  But the music at its core is just as remarkable.<br /><br />The special edition of this album comes with two bonus tracks: \\"Time Is All Around\\" is an upbeat track with some not-so-upbeat lyrics, and \\"The Sword & The Pen\\" is a somber song that seems to conjure up classical Russian composition. One note of interest is that ten minutes of silence has been tagged on to the end of \\"Man of a Thousand Faces\\" before the start of the bonus tracks.  I suppose the idea was to keep the bonuses as a separate entity.  However, if you rip this album to your computer to transfer to an mp3 player, you may want to trim that time off.<br /><br />This edition also comes with a DVD featuring music videos for \\"Laughing With,\\" \\"Eet,\\" \\"Dance Anthem of the 80's\\" and \\"Man of a Thousand Faces.\\"  I'm not a huge fan of music videos in general, but these are worth a few viewings.<br /><br />It's worth noting that this edition comes with full lyrics for all songs, including the bonuses.  I believe the regular print DOES NOT.  So if you like knowing all the words, this would be the edition to get.
0385341008|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and potato Peel Pie Society was an impressive story of German occupation of the Channel Islands in World War II.  As a history review, it presented a good picture of what life was like during the occupation and the trials suffered by the people who lived there.  It was a good picture of the positive attributes that some people possess even in unrewarding jobs they sometimes have to do.  The Channel Islands people were very resilient and creative.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Outlander is a very fun film.  There is a but much in gore, but not as bad as many other movies.  What was good was the plot, the character development, and he cinematography.  It has great and realistic sets, and the mountain scenes are great.      An action, adventure, scifi movie well worth watching.
B0026J8LHM|5.0|Dream Theater are back and at the top of their game with their newest and tenth album release \\"Black Clouds and Silver Linings\\".  I wasn't overly crazy at first of their last release Systematic Chaos but it grew on me.  But from the first listen of the opening track \\"A Nightmare to Remember\\" I instantly loved this new disc and knew it was something special.  The remaining five tracks did not dissapoint.  I highly disagree with the one star review.  The great musicianship and songwriting that we've grown accustomed with Dream Theater is still there.  LaBrie's vocals are in top form along with the exceptional and jaw-dropping playing of Petrucci, Portnoy, Myung and Ruddess.  These guys are the best progressive rock band out there, hands down and they prove it time and time again and especially on their newest disc.  This will be in my cd player for a long time to come.
B001D2AYCI|3.0|Is the 'quadraphonic' disc DVD-Audio or just DVD?    I say this as you need a specific DVD-audio player to hear it properly, as  DVD-audio uses discreet PCM streams.    DVD uses a digital stream, so the sound quality is different. If you play  a DVD-audio mastered disc on DVD equipment no doubt it'll sound muffled and crap as they are different signals.    Since DVD-audio is a dead format, like Quadraphonic, you would think the record company geniuses would release it as a standard DVD disc with a Dolby digital 5.1 or DTS mix like they did with the Nick Cave and Talking Heads remasters.    Regardless there is a bootleg Quad DVD of 'Paranoid' in DTS format on the net, you wonder why the stupid record industry complains about bootlegging and going broke when their idiot staff can't even get formats and product right for the market. But i may be wrong, if this post get responses to confirm otherwise.
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|I don't know what happened here but my copy of the blu-ray version of The Terminator looks just like regular old dvd quality to me.  It is not terrible but not nearly as sharp as every other blu-ray disc I've watched with my system, the picture is just soft, not quite as good as a good regular dvd transfer watched with a first rate standard dvd player.  Somebody was either asleep at the switch or trying to  pull a fast one to make a few bucks, although I fail to see how it makes any sense.
0385341008|5.0|It is 1946 and Juliet Ashton is looking for an idea for her next book. She found wonderful success during World War II writing humor pieces to distract fellow British citizens from the horrors of war, but now she wants to write something different. A letter from someone she doesn't even know might give her the inspiration she need. As Juliet and Dawsey Adams, a resident of the island of Guernsey, which was occupied by the Nazis during the war, correspond, Juliet discovers a group of brave people whose love for reading and each other helped them survive the horrors they faced. But when she travels to Guernsey, she'll discover far more than that.<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society is one of those unexpected reads that will completely capture the attention of readers and transport them completely into the story. The novel is told in a long series of letters, which may be a turn off for some, but the sharp and sometimes subtle humor in them will capture readers' hearts by page five. The characters are all very colorful and diverse, and each one shines through their own words and passions. The citizens of Guernsey and how each of them discovers a love of reading is wonderful to read, and their pain of the loss of property, family, and friends through the occupation of their home is heartrending. Full of wisdom and courage and love and heartbreak, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society will teach you something about history, about literature, and about human nature. This is a definite must-read.

B001TH16DI|4.0|Guys,    I am somebody who almost bought Star Trek - Original series 3 times, one time on DVD (for $90 a season), one time on HD-DVD and one time on BluRAY. I am tired of them milking this.    That being said, I don't believe this set deserves a star only because of the Paramount milking it and most important without seeing it.  I have seen 5 of the 6 movies and they look great. Everybody makes a big thing from the fact that they restored only the Wrath of Khan. Let me tell you this, from the 4 movies I've seen, the Wrath of Khan looks the worst. No joke... Maybe they restored it because it was crappy before... Just look close at the scenes from the container (at the beginning of the movie) with Khan, Checkov and the captain. The transfer is really bad with a lot of optic/lens distortions.    I think this set is good and the only complain is that they did not pack all the Star Trek movies together, including also the ones with Picard.    Guys, we know you mean well but please stop writing bad or good stuff about things you never saw...
B0027WNRIG|5.0|Not only is pyromania my 2nd favorite album of all time, it has been remastered to fit my music needs when it comes to my favorite band of all time (DEF LEPPARD).  It's got an awesome live disc, from 1983, same year this came out.  Back in the day in fact, this album hit number to, ONLY to Michael Jackson's thriller, and sold 10 million in the U.S.  This band is incredible, and so is the album!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU BUY!
B000PHOY0A|5.0|This is an extremly well writtn book. It is fun and easy to read! Unlike other history books that are all fact this book creats a perfect blend of fact and opinion. If you want to know the fates of human socitties based on guns, germs, and steel read this book!
1439157383|2.0|To me this book was boring the way it was written and a little bit confusing, until it got closer to the end.   I actually began enjoying it about half way through the book.  What I really enjoyed was the ending.  It definetely had an ending in the book that you would not expect.  Looking forward to seeing the movie.  I would give it 3 stars instead of my orginal 2.
B0000029AL|5.0|There is no album in the history of the world with as much attitude as Aerosmith's debut LP.  Second in-line is 'Appetite For Destruction', but guess what?, if U listen carefully U will realize it has a mix reminiscent of Aerosmith's debut.    Although future Aerosmith releases were more polished and featured their signature sound, this release is distilled power, based on feel and attitude.  The band plays where no particular member stands out or is highlighted ( Tyler & Perry ), but instead gel into a solid heavy rock-blues whole.      Of all Aerosmith albums, it is one U will continue to go back to time and time again.  I have been for 30 years.      The Songs:  Make It - odd riff, and a great start to the album.  Steven's belting his vocal over the strong rhythm section...just superb!    Somebody - chills...oh man...just a great rock blues song.    Dream On - what is there to say besides maybe one of the 10 best rock ballads in the world.  Ever.    One Way Street - Super sweet riffs, strong back beat and vocals.    Mama Kin - Good straightforward rock song.    Write Me - Blues Rock with spirit and moments of sophistication & melancholia    Movin' Out - Stank!  Feel like a rooster in a hen house when this song plays...it is just so strong.    Walkin' The Dog - Better than Rufus Thomas version and the one which all 80's bands lifted but could never match.    Seriously, this is the sound of a band hungry, honest and proud.  There is so much integrity to this album, you can feel it.
B0026J8LHM|5.0|This is another great album by Dream Theater!  I love how some reviewers are telling them to quit showing off.  What do you them to do play average like almost everyone else out there?  What a moronic statement!  \\"Quit showing off?\\"  Come on!  Please keep showing off, thank you very much.
1881273156|5.0|This is a very easy-reading book. The five love languages mentioned in this book will not only work well on the communication in romantic relationship but also in friendship. The two tests for husband and wife at the end of this book will help you find out your partner's and your own love languages. Try to communicate with your partner in her/his love language and see the improvement of your relationship. I strongly recommend this book!
0140277447|5.0|The late Iris Chang's book \\"The Rape of Nanking\\" is an important history of one of the darkest chapters in World War II.  Chang takes a journalist's approach to the subject as she details the events that unfolded in Nanking, China when the Japanese Army overran the city in late 1937 and early 1938.  The orgy of blood and violence perpetrated upon the Chinese people by the Imperial Japanese Army equals in brutality the worst excesses of the Nazi regime in Europe.  In an ironic historical twist, it was a Nazi minister in the city who spearheaded the efforts among foreign nationals in Nanking to save Chinese lives.  Chang's chronicle of this event and its unlikely heroes makes for fascinating reading.  Chang also writes of the historical controversy that has surrounded the episode as few Japanese people are willing to acknowledge the event even today.  While Germany as a nation has been ever engaged in examining its role in the Holocaust, the Japanese are ever reluctant to discuss the crimes of the Imperial government in WWII.  Chang's work has already done much to inform the world of this horrid event and hopefully it will continue to generate a dialogue.
0440237688|5.0|I should probably preface this review by saying that I first read this amazing novel in the 7th grade (age 13).  I say this because of the many 1-star reviews warning parents of the \\"dangers\\" of children reading this book.  I have to agree with this on some levels, but probably not on the level as most of the reviewers.  More on this later.    The Giver is a very complex and enthralling novel about what life would be like if our society strived to exist as a \\"perfect\\" utopia-like community.  Jonas, along with all his friends, have their careers chosen for them, the less intelligent children being forced into laborers or \\"birthmothers\\".  Jonas is decided by the elders to be a very special child, and is sent to study with an old man who can transfer memories of a distant life to him.  Jonas must now carry the burden of these memories alone.      The overall tone of the novel I found to be quite sorrowful.  From The Giver's own loss to the society's way of dealing with overpopulation, I found myself tearing up on occasion.  The idea that no one, except perhaps for Jonas and the Giver, can experience \\"love\\" is just beyond horrible.  However, there were many parts of the novel I found to be uplifting and just plain fun to read, such as the interaction between Jonas and his sister, Lilly.      Bringing in my original statements about children reading this, I do feel that the novel's true meaning might be a little out of reach for younger children.  That would be my one reservation when recommending it.  HOWEVER, I don't think denying this book to children simply because of the \\"violent\\" sections (it was what, one paragraph?) is doing anyone any good.  If a child has the intellectual capacity to understand the book's point, let them read it.  I read it at the young age of 13 and have read it many, many times since.  While I found the goings-on of the society quite shocking, I did not have nightmares and to be quite honest, I found myself remembering other parts of the bookmore than the parts that seem to be so controversial on here.      My point is, this book is a classic.  Every now and then, I find myself picking it up and reading it in the span of a few hours.  Each and every time, I gain a new perspective on the characters and story.  It's one that should not be missed.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet:    The tracks on this album are like hands that wrap around your soul, squeeze and tear it out and then shove it back in through your ears.    Not for the faint of heart, but highly recommended.
0760748683|5.0|Love the story, and this little book with gold edges is the perfect copy to keep and enjoy again and again.  In our disposable society they just don't make books like this one anymore.  Great gift for the Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen, lover in your life, or better yet for yourself.

B000G7PNAE|5.0|This album was the defined turning point for Journey. This album spawned off two tours of the album, a live album from the tour later released in 2006, and even their own video game on the Atari 2600.<br /><br />This album got Journey a number one spot on the Billboard's Pop Albums and with 10 tracks on the album, 4 singles came from this album which were, \\"Who's Crying Now\\", \\"Still They Ride\\", \\"Open Arms\\", and the band's most recognizable song, \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\". All of them broke the Billboard's top 20 with 3 in the top 10, and 2 in the top 5. Several non-single tracks like Stone in Love, Mother Father, and Escape had their own popularity and most have found their way on Journey's compilation albums like Time3, Greatest Hits Live, and The Essential Journey. Even the other 3 \\"Dead or Alive\\", \\"Lay it Down\\", and \\"Keep on Runnin'\\" all have a special place in the heart of the album and the fans.<br /><br />Escape as you can tell from several other reviews of mine including this one, is my favorite album because it has most of the Journey classics being \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\", \\"Stone in Love\\", \\"Who's Crying Now\\", \\"Still the Ride\\", \\"Escape\\", and my favorite rock ballad of all time \\"Open Arms\\". The Album also just never gets old for me as I've listened to it dozens of times.<br /><br />The reissue features another classic hit from Time3, \\"La Raza Del Sol\\" which has a more Latin feel to it like Santana which is a rare occasion but definately worth a listen. Closing the reissue is the 3 big singles from Escape from the Live in Houston album which are \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\", \\"Open Arms\\", and \\"Who's Crying Now\\".<br /><br />Like with other classic rock albums, Escape ages well and whether if your a fan of Journey or arena rock, you should welcome this album to your CD collection with \\"Open Arms\\".
B0026OE2NY|5.0|French photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand makes an incredible directorial debut and narrator Glenn Close is outstanding in this 118-minute aerial exploration of Earth's grand treasures.<br /><br />Cameras capture a very unique perspective of 54 countries in the documentary that carries an array of environmental warnings. The message stressed throughout is the stewardship of the finite resources has become as urgent as ever, with the natural beauty oftentimes concealing the growing degradation.<br /><br />There are no DVD \\"extras,\\" but this is one time where the main feature says it all....in sweeping and triumphant grandeur.
B0015AARJI|5.0|My controller was brand new and arrived in 2 days.  I was skeptical when I ordered from them because i needed to receive it with 4 days and refused to pay extra to upgrade the shipping.  Boy was Amazon great they actually got it to me in 2 days and I didn't have to pay anything extra.  I know I can always depend on Amazon which is why I order everything through them.
B000W07EKW|1.0|The picture shown(which is the limited edition that I wanted) is NOT what I got - I got the regular 'dark box' version - a total let down; and because it came from a third party dealer(instead of directly from Amazon) it was a too much extra work to get the order returned, refilled & reordered, mind you w/ NO guarantee I would actually get the right product the second time around. I ended up finding the CORRECT item elsewhere, and trading the wrong one for a couple of copies of CATS(B-day presents for chicks)...SO, IF You're going to buy this, try getting a hold of the dealer directly & make sure they sent the right thing...if they even actually have it - they might be lying all together...
B001684L0A|1.0|The acting, dialogue, and pacing are all superb--credit the director and the actors for that. Where the movie falls down is in the camera work, which comes close to ruining the entire series. Apparently, no tripod was used for the camera work in this film. Instead, the point of view  is always moving--up,down,side to side. Imagine yourself in a movie theater, trying to enjoy the story unfolding on the screen before you, but the person next to you keeps bumping your shoulder, jarring the image in front of you, causing you to lose your concentration. That is the practical result of the camera shenanigans used in this movie. As a result, the viewer is never quite able to lose himself in the film. And that is a shame, for it is a compelling story. Instead, we are continually being \\"bumped\\" by an intruding Director of Photography. The camera work should never draw attention to itself, at least not to the exaggerated extent that it does in JA.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I was quite a bit skeptical about this movie in spite of all the positive reviews I had read and heard.  After, there are more suspense/thriller movies that make a good trailer and that is about all.  However, I must say I thorougly enjoyed the movie and thought Liam Neeson was great.<br /><br />Of course, you have to be willing to let a few unbelievable coincidences and plot liberties slide, but by and large this made for some very entertaining and captivating time.  I will say, it was also difficult to watch from the standpoint that there are plenty of depressing and sick reports to confirm the growth of a worldwide sex slave trade run by crime syndicates.  I give the movie credit for tackling a tough and important issue without being gratuitous or also downplaying the reality of the problem.  Lastly, I thought the movie hit the right time limit to keep it from becoming absurd or repetitive.  Many films like \\"Taken\\" often go 15-30 minutes too long, trying to squeeze out more drama and achieve nothing but diminishing returns.<br /><br />Overall, this is a worthwile 80 minutes and the movie looks great on Blu-Ray.
B00204AA0O|4.0|For someone so associated with the New York anti-folk scene, Russian-American singer-songwriter Regina Spektor sure knows her way around a pop tune or thirteen. After 2006's commercial smash (well, by indie standards) Begin To Hope, it should come as no surprise that this latest, the eagerly awaited Far, pulls no punches. From the opening staccato chords and syncopated hi-hat of opener \\"Calculation,\\" Spektor sets up a piano shop in one's head and relentlessly pounds the ivories to pop perfection. Indeed, the first half of the album poses a question many longtime Spektor fans are wondering after this album first began streaming: has their beloved, endlessly quirky Regina sold out after all?<br /><br />One would expect Spektor to be able to produce such hook-filled tunes effortlessly after hearing \\"Fidelity\\" everywhere a few years ago, but evidently she isn't taking any chances, enlisting a total of four producers to mastermind her third release. Four producers, of course, who you might have heard of: Mike Elizondo, Jacknife Lee, David Kahne, and ELO's Jeff Lynne. Between them they've produced such artists as Kelly Clarkson, U2, Eminem, and that other piano vixen, Fiona Apple, and it's not exactly hard to see what direction Spektor is going in from the get-go. The fairly nonsensical but no less accessible \\"Eet\\" gets by on its addictive chorus, while the gorgeous \\"Blue Lips\\" features Spanish-flavored production underscoring Spektor's typically expressive vocals (\\"blue, the color of our planet from far, far away / blue, the most human color\\").<br /><br />Note-perfect, exquisitely-produced, and with the kind of tongue-in-cheek lyrics Spektor has so excelled at (\\"I've got a perfect body, but sometimes I forget / I've got a perfect body, `cause my eyelashes catch my sweat\\"), \\"Folding Chair\\" is, for all its catchiness, sometimes unbearably cute. It's a problem Spektor struggles with throughout the album, a division between her desire to appeal to everyone and the necessary separation with the old Spektor that that entails. And on a song like the clattering, over-produced \\"Machine,\\" which features some choice lyrics about a dystopian future yet also is burdened with the most grating chorus on record, Spektor seems to be trying too hard to sound radically different, as if overcompensating for the major harmony radiance of \\"Folding Chair.\\"<br /><br />Then again, Spektor makes a fine pop song, no matter who's behind the boards. And after the cloying, no-atheist-in-a-foxhole message of first single \\"Laughing With,\\" which falls flat on its contrived spiritualism, the album really starts to piece together the best parts of Spektor's talented lyricism and penchant for hooks. The majestic, nearly hymnal \\"Human of the Year\\" is the clear centerpiece here, starting as a tepid piano ballad before ascending into a ringing chorus and a bridge where Spektor's voice soars more grandly than ever.<br /><br />While a song like \\"Two Birds\\" might be knocked for being too lyrically simple, or a generational satire like \\"Dance Anthem of the 80s\\" considered too silly, both marry the best of Spektor's skills: her tenacious pursuit of a good melody and even more dogged affinity for irreverent humor and insightful observations. Just check out the \\"solo!\\" breakdown in the latter and try not to smile.<br /><br />The album ends on perhaps its best streak, beginning with the understated \\"Wallet,\\" continuing through the uplifting \\"One More Time with Feeling,\\" and ending on the rather anti-climactic \\"Man of a Thousand Faces.\\" Only Spektor could make a song about finding a stranger's lost wallet and returning it into a two-minute-long heartbreaker, or turn a song about hospitals into the anthem of the album.<br /><br />But it's \\"Man of a Thousand Faces\\" that takes the cake, a smoky, understated ballad that slow burns its way through the tale of a man alone in the world but never explodes into the climax it promises. Instead, it realizes the true potential of Spektor'stalents, most notably her ability to make a song beautiful no matter what production surrounds her. When Spektor raises above the tinkling piano and echoing percussion to proclaim \\"good is better than perfect / scrub till your fingers are bleeding\\" before falling back to intone \\"and I'm crying for things / I tell others to do without crying,\\" everything comes together without a hitch.<br /><br />For all of Spektor's trademark peculiar vocal affectations and oft-ridiculous lyrics, there's her distinctive piano style, her versatile voice, and, of course, her knowledge of how to make a song that sticks. Far is not a perfect album, and it will no doubt leave many fans disgruntled, but it can't be said that Regina is not a songstress of the highest order. Even when surrounded by big names that threaten to overwhelm her voice more than they embrace it, her ability to distinguish herself cements her as one of her generation's most prominent artists.ong beautiful no matter what production surrounds her.

B0008KLVG4|5.0|Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition) (1975) was a great five star film that little more needs to be said about.  It was an early example of Spielberg's great work and even greater work to come.  I remember seeing this film in the summer of 1975 with my wife and a group of friends who all felt we had watched something very special at the time.<br /><br />This was one of the first films to take advantage of full size \\"robotic\\" animals, but it was good film technique and editing that made the movie work as the mechanical shark was very difficult to operate.  Something I did not know was that the shark was designed by the same technician that developed Disney's Giant Squid for 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. That early mechanical monster was also very difficult to work with but Disney stuck with it until it looked credible on film. A good documentary was included with this package.
0307266303|5.0|Running is the most natural of human endevours. This is the story of a man who a man on a mission. The Mission was to learn to run the natural way (for VERY long distances). This story is very well told and full of incredible characters and exotic places. You can read it as a running book, a travel book, a history book, or a science book - it is all that and more. Mr. McDougall is a great storyteller and a gifted writer. This a great book!!
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I have read The Fountainhead and saw the movie many years ago.  I loved it then and so enjoyed seeing it again,  i wanted to keep the movie as a \\"classic\\" in my library. It is a great movie and sends a powerful message. And one cannot go wrong when Gary Cooper, Pat Neal, and Raymond Masssey are in the cast.
0307341569|2.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.It was well written but the characters are so unlikable.There are such a lot of disgusting scenarios-killing animals, drugs etc. that it's hard to appreciate the story which was cleverly written although a bit longer than it needed to be to tell the story.  So it was really a rather depressing read.
0439023483|5.0|Won't make this too long, but just want to say I would DEFINITELY recommend this book. I couldn't put it down from the moment I started it, and I had to finish it that very day. It reminds me of a mixture between \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" and \\"The Lottery\\" (both short stories). Very unique story line. It's brutal, but fantastic. You won't regret buying this one!!
B000006TRV|5.0|A must have even if you have the original cd because it's probably overplayed anyways.  Got this for my husband and he loves it, so do my kids.  Awesome.
B001IXSU8M|5.0|Lady GaGa has a musical talent that is AMAZING!  It isn't contrived like many artists in her genre are.  The creative talent in this one is VERY strong.   Her live performances are great as well and she is very much like a Drag Queen performing.  Which is a good thing.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Sweet, perceptive, sharp and near-perfect, Juno is a memorable film that will still be great viewing decades after its release. Right from the beginning when Juno is chugging away on Sunny D, we want to see watch she will say and do next. It's disarmingly fresh, frank and funny, this story about young love, being knocked up, and the unexpected direction the unplanned pregnancy takes. Coupled with the witty script, Page's terrific performance, and a quirkily fun soundtrack, Reitman would really have to try hard to mess things up. Thankfully he doesn't, and the result is an enjoyable, highly entertaining, and even occasionally touching
0380820498|4.0|I'm working my way through this series very happily.  Almost all of them have been top shelf in my estimation.  Oddly enough some of the more recent ones are the hardest to find new, even on Amazon.  I still haven't Kindled partially because of this series.  For older paperback books there really should be some type of discount.  I can get the same book in paper brand new or I can pay the same and just get the Kindle version. I do a lot of \\"author discovery\\" reading, I'd rather have to be to give away if it comes down to it...  Anyway, this series is probably one of my favorite finds of the last couple of years.  If you haven't read him, start from the beginning.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|Plenty of thrills, just enough bedroom action, and a smattering of witty retorts to keep things crackling. Better than the average action movie and I'm still looking forward to future installments. But it falls well short of Casino Royale's greatness. Director Marc Forster has made a first rate action thriller -- Next time, however, we'd like to be reminded that the hero of the movie is called Bond...James Bond.
B00005JKJA|5.0|From the outset I must confess that this review is not so much a conventional movie review per se but rather a deeper character and   plot examination/analysis, which I hope will unveil and perhaps shed   some new light on the meanings behind David Lynch's supreme film noir mind bender - Mullholland Drive.     So if you want to experience the thrill of unravelling and 'investigating' the myriad jiggsaw puzzle-like aspects of this movie  for yourself then proceed no further. For those of you familiar or even  well acquainted with the Mullholland Drive universe you may be intrigued   by the theories I present here - so here goes.    First of all, I have not found on any Mullholland Drive internet forums or  chat groups discussion about how crucially important a part the 'Cowboy' character plays in the story and in solving/unlocking the various plot threads of the puzzle. How understanding who he is and more importantly who he represents and or symbolizes in Dianes' dream and waking life/reality allows all the pieces of the puzzle to fall into place.    The 'Cowboy' has to be one of the most bizarre, chilling and creepiest of creeps in the history of cinema and one that only could have been spawned from the mind of David Lynch ( it's my belief that Lynch has created some of cinema's most diabolically perverse and just plain nasty bad guys or creeps - think Frank Booth in Blue Velvet or Bobby Peru - Wild At Heart - truly sinister).    So lets look more closely at the 'Cowboy' character . It is revealed to us the viewer that the 'Cowboy' holds ultimate control and power over    all the movie's characters and most likely Hollywood. He is the one who is controlling everything - from his underling mob henchmen - The Casiglieri brothers to Camilla Rhodes' bodyguards to the midget Mr Roake.    He is the head honcho, the one calling all the shots from up high in the  Hollywood hills from his 'Corrale'. He has the power to close down the   production of a feature film and hehas the power to recast a starring actress (Camilla) in his movie - and it is his movie.    Lynch makes it very clear to us that this is the case. The Cowboy basically uses extortion and threats to strongarm the Adam Kesher character into agreeing to his terms - 'You can ride along with me'.    Now if you accept my theory that he is the ultimate antagonist in the   film and therefore in Diane's dream - pulling all the strings as it were, then we must examine and analyze this character even further.       You will need to watch the film perhaps a few more times to pick up these  details however I will point out some here:    a) Pay special attention to what the 'Cowboy' says and how he says it.       You will notice that he speaks with a 'Southern' accent (possibly Texan) - this is important.     b) Also, look closely at his outfit. No mistaking he's a cowboy alright     with his 10 gallon hat and all. Is it much of a stretch for us to imagine he could also be wearing a Sheriff's badge? Could it be that the   'Cowboy' is also some kind of 'Old Western' stlye Sheriff or U.S Marshall   maybe even a Texas Ranger?    He certainly weilds his power, authority and clout as if he were some  type of high ranking law enforcer - that is clearly evident.     Lynch uses all manner of clever cinematic devices to weave his intricate tapestry. His use of symbolism, metaphor, omens, dream interpretation, psycho-analysis, American History, fable, myth, allegory, cautionary tale, alter ego, dual character, reference/homage to 'Old' Hollywood -  particularly The Wizard of Oz, magic and many more is all here and laced throughout Mullholland Drive.    So if we accept that the 'Cowboy' is not a minor character and is more significant in the context of the plot than what he appears to be at face value, then literally a whole other Pandora's box opens up, with truly new meanings and earth shattering implications unfolding.    I will briefly outline some here.    I believe that the 'Cowboy' is represented not just as the 'Cowboy' but as  2 other characters in the dream section of the movie. They are, can you guess? Gene the Pool Man played by well known country music popstar Billy Ray Cyrus - no less. Making the connection now? And the other manifestation of the 'Cowboy' is the creepy man Betty (Diane) performs  the audition scene with - Wally I think his name is.     Again, if you watch Wally carefully in this scene you will see that he speaks and acts very much like a 'B' grade 'Western' actor from the 1950's and 60's. In the scene they are rehearsing in front of the small group of Director, Producer, Casting Agent etc etc, and in the script Wally plays the part of the girl's incestuous uncle - now this is a key clue. If we apply the logic that the 'Cowboy' is actually being represented or embodied as 3 characters-Cowboy, Gene (Poolman)and Wally then we can begin to see how Lynch is carefully laying the groundwork for us to pick up the true identity of the 'Cowboy' and his real relationship to Diane.      After careful deduction we can see that the 'Cowboy' is a symbolic dream representation of Diane's real-life evil and incestuous Uncle who was the corrupt town Sheriff with Mob connections and who sexually abused her as a young girl.      I believe Lynch does this with all the other main characters in the movie. In Diane's scrambled dream-logic section of the film (first Three Quaters)characters merge, blur and morph and swap around as they do in actual dreams. However, the fundamental attributes of any particular character remains consistant despite them alternating and changing shape and form. In other words every character depicted in the dream section of  the movie can be directly tranlated as someone from Diane's real life and or past.    By applying this logic I believe Lynch has quite clearly layed out how the puzzle of Mullholland Drive can be solved - everthing is symbolic of  something or someone who is important to the logic of the story.I don't   think Lynch has left any aspect of the film to chance. Nothing has been left unanswered under his masterly direction.      I've run out of time and space here but I would like to continue this   essay and reveal more findings, such as how I believe Adam Kesher is a symbol or metaphor for Diane's father. Details about Diane's sad past-  including how she is actually from the South not the North. I believe   Deep River is really a reference to the South's great Missisippi River.    The true meaning of the Blue Box and many more.    So bye for now   Bruce (24.6.09)
B001ECQ75A|4.0|I purchased this movie for the charity organization Childs play, so I am not in possession of the movie. However I have seen the movie and it is so cute. This movie has the important message not to give up and to believe in yourself. I hope which ever child received the movie will take the message to heart.

B00204AA0O|4.0|This is the best birthday present I've gotten all year.     Regina Spektor's third proper album, Far, is like that cynical older cousin who you love to sit next to at family functions. Totally funny, mostly good-natured, and both angry and delicious -- angrilicious? -- like the kind of person who says all the things you want to say but don't.    And -- uh -- says them all in cute, random metaphors and rhyming couplets and sweet, sweet melodies.    After the meandering intro of \\"The Calculation\\" -- a good, mid-tempo, semi-funked-out song about relationships, technology, and emotional indifference -- we get a virtual onslaught of Regina with the instant hookiness, smileyness, and spine-tingling anticipation of the piano chords that lead into \\"Eet.\\"     The song might be named for its homonym, or it might be the way Spektor writes down her own whimsical non-word singing on paper. Then, when the drums come in -- \\"You spend half of your life/trying to fall behind/using your headphones to drown out your mind\\" -- the song becomes simultaneously triumphant and snarky. And it's especially victorious when you consider it's a song about hipster kids who are so preoccupied with looking cool that they forget how to dance. (That's what I think it's about, anyway.) Really, it's a self-defeating argument -- by the time you're done analyzing, you're hopping up and down in your desk chair, anyway.    A few weeks ago, I posted <a href=\\"[...]\\">Regina Spektor's new video</a>, \\"Laughing With.\\" It's been seized upon and passed around a fair bit among the bloggy folks, but I don't think any of us have really given as much credence to the lyrics as they deserve.    No one laughs at God  When the doctor calls after some routine tests  No one's laughing at God  When it's gotten real late  And their kid's not back from the party yet    So freakin' true. And yet, if this wasn't being sung within the context of an MTV video with cool effects and a Harry Potter-like Cloak of Invisibility, we'd probably freak out and call the writer a zealot or a fundamentalist.    But Spektor always likes to close her songs abruptly, which drove me crazy when \\"Better\\" was on the radio, or when I listened to her songs out of sequence on my iPod's Party Shuffle (which, btw, I love saying, because I never actually use shuffle at parties, but I always feel like being at a party when I'm walking down the street and I select that option) -- but which, taken on its own, is both wise and satisfying. The closing line of \\"Laughing With,\\" which fades out together with the song -- \\"No one's laughing at God/We're all laughing with God\\" -- is kind of the perfect paradigm of this. It's winking at the listener and pulling the rug out from under our feet at the same time.     \\"Two Birds\\" is the natural offset to \\"Laughing With,\\" a parable about two birds that don't trust each other. The chorus, \\"I'll believe it all/There's nothing I won't understand/I'll believe it all/I won't let go of your hand,\\" speaks to our natural tendency to distrust each other, to get cold and clam up and retreat into our own little worlds.    To one extent or another, artists are all recluses. We hate other people. We distrust them and fear them and don't want to trust our ideas with them, preferring instead to remain in our own little universes that we draw and write around ourselves. Again, witness the \\"Laughing With\\" video...or just try to talk to me while I'm writing in my notebook. And then, on the other side of the spectrum, we're trying more than anything to understand the way people work, and get inside their heads, and to create a song or a story that's bigger than ourselves.     I think what I love most about Regina Spektor is that she really gets both of these things. And both of them, she does so well.
B0002A2WDQ|3.0|Eugene (Ralph Macchio), is a young white kid obsessed with the blues. He's read every book imaginable and wonders what ever became of the last song recorded by Robert Johnson. He thinks the answer is being kept secret by an old blues harmonica player named Willie Brown (Joe Seneca). Willie is having health problems and residing against his will at a nursing home. When the youngster pays him a visit the old man dismisses him. Since the kid persists he agrees to give him the lost song if he'll help him bust out of the nursing home. This dangerous offer spooks Eugene but proves too irresistible. It doesn't take long for these two to start hoboing across the South. Willie wants to get back home and promises Eugene that once there the song is his. The two run out of funds quickly and are forced to hitchhike. A sexy, young runaway named Frances (Jami Gertz) joins the pair for one leg of their journey and romances Eugene. The film is fun and full of awesome music. That end duel is amazing. I don't know who Steve Vai is but dude can play. Seneca is the life of the movie. He's hilarious and as quick with a quip as he is on harmonica. Macchio and him riff off each other beautifully. Speaking of beautiful, Jami Gertz is good in her half hour of screen time. Things really pick up when Willie commandeers an old juke joint he used to play at and jams with his young protege. The great Joe Morton appears as the Devil's assistant. An interesting and fun film from director Walter Hill.
B00204AA0O|4.0|I have to hand it to Regina Spektor -- she actually has managed to refine and further her unique anti-folk/pop sound, but also keep the unique qualities of her older style. Her third studio album \\"Far\\" is all about this -- lots of multifaceted, fluid expanses of piano, weird little songs about computers made of macaroni, and a quirky little voice. It's a more polished piece of work, but still has the twists and edges to keep it interesting.<br /><br />\\"We sat there looking at the faces/Of these stranges in the pages/'Til we knew 'em mathematically,\\" Spektor says over a powerful, bouncing piano melody. She sings of creating pasta computers that \\"counted up our feelings/And divided them up even/And it called that calculation perfect love\\" and cutting out their own little pebble-hearts that they \\"struck 'em so hard/So hard/Until they sparked.\\"<br /><br />Well, it's nice to see that she isn't writing your average MTV goopy love-ballad about kissing.<br /><br />It's followed up by a wistful little ballad with a title like a hiccup (\\"Eeeee-eeeeee-eeeeet!\\") , a horn-and-synth-riddled pop melody that bounces and swirls alternately, a stompy piano-rockers, mellow slower songs, soaring ballads about the ultimate prize (\\"Human, human of the year, you are\\"), a dance song or two, sprightly sunny pop melodies, a pair of rambling anti-folky songs.<br /><br />It's nice to see that greater exposure hasn't taken away the weird from Regina Spektor's work. Rather than your usual silly love songs and personal laments, she tackles the loss of familiar things, God's sense of humor, a society full of chipper automatons (\\"They started out beneath the knowledge tree/Then they chopped it down to make white picket fences\\") and a 1984-esque story about being \\"hooked into machine.\\" When it's not bizarre, she inserts little quirks and strange images that stick in your mind (\\"Blue lips, blue veins/The color of our planet from far away\\").<br /><br />She also has become more polished musically, with everything a bit smoother and nimbler than before. Her piano is still the centerpiece -- it jabs, flows, bounces, ripples and elegantly twists -- and it's accompanied by the occasional swirl of synth, some horns, and plenty of subtle drumming. Listen carefully and you can hear a bit of violin in songs like \\"Laughing With,\\" and some tambourine in \\"Blue Lips,\\" just enough to flavor their sounds.<br /><br />The song that doesn't fit in is \\"Dance Anthem of the 80s,\\" which tries to fuse anti-pop and dance. The jabby jangling \\"Machine\\" (with its eerie synth and jingling chains) doesn't entirely fit either, but taken alone it's a gorgeously, brutally memorable song.<br /><br />Well, enough of that. Spektor's slightly creaky vocals weave easily between clear high sweetness and quirky murmurs, and she's got a special knack for evoking a slightly magical, bittersweet worldview -- genies, a genial deity, love games, balloons, a lake that turns \\"thick as butter,\\" and rainy streets. Lots of delightfully odd phrases (\\"and the pride inside their eyes/is synchronised to a love you'll never know\\") and images (sparks flying from a pair of pebble-hearts).<br /><br />Despite a couple of songs that don't quite mesh (one awkward and one awesome), Regina Spektor's \\"Far\\" is a solid follow-up to her anti-folk and anti-pop tunes of the past.ler than before.

B001PPLIEG|3.0|This movie was okay but not what you expect from James Bond. It was more like Jason Bourne. I don't think I really cared for a revenge minded Bond. Plus you never find out what happened or what was said when he finally found the guy he was looking for during the whole film. All in all, kind of disappointing.

B0027WNRJ0|5.0|Def Leppard's 1992 Follow-Up To The Over Amazing, Extraordinary \\"HYSTERIA\\" was no simple task to complete, Def Leppard has faced another major setback, the death of there fellow guitar player and a major contributor to the music of Def Leppard: \\"Steve Clark\\". Steve, Had already written/recorded a lot of the songs featured on \\"Adrenalize\\", so with that already said, after his passing, Def Leppard had to either stop or go and they decided to go, Phil Collen had the job of picking up where Steve left off and re-recording everything Steve had almost finished. Adrenalize is a great, rocking album and although not \\"HYSTERIA\\", is still a great sequel.    Now, on to this Remaster. It's Great, The Remaster Does It Justice and Yea, It Makes The Total Difference Compared To The Original Disc Released in 1992. The Volumes Have Been Put Up On All The Cylinders, The Guitars Are Much Clearer and Cleaner...Overall This Remaster Rocks!    Disc-2, Contains A Lot Of Live Tracks From The Adrenalize Tour and You'll Find The Rare-Gem Of The Demo Version Of \\"Tonight\\" which Is Awesome!    I Highly Recommend This Deluxe Edition, The Sleek Package and The Music That Awaits You On The Inside Will Blow You Away!
0374139563|1.0|This review was first posted on Oxfam's From Poverty to Power blog on [...]    The Dambisa Moyo phenomenon shows no signs of abating, with a front page story in the FT and an elevation this month to Time Magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people. The publicity is also selling a lot of books - she's currently 3rd in Amazon US sales rankings for books on `policy and current events' (no sour grapes there, honest....).    So with heavy heart, it's time to add my tuppence. Every time I say anything unkind about her book, Dead Aid, I get a volley of abuse about being a white imperialist male unwilling to surrender the intoxicating power conferred by being a paid up member of the `aid industry' (n.b. I'm being sarcastic, OK?). So just in case you're naïve enough to think the continent speaks with one (Moyoesque) voice, here is a review by Chikondi Mpokosa, from Malawi, about her disappointment with the book. Chikondi is Oxfam's Global Education Adviser, so cynics might argue that she is not neutral but a) Moyo's main objection is to official government to government aid, not the NGO type, b) Chikondi sees lots of problems with traditional aid and c) Moyo previously worked for Goldman Sachs and the World Bank, which also seems to have shaped her views somewhat (see below). For a more academic review by a fellow Zambian economist, see here, and Sudanese-born telecoms magnate and philanthropist Mo Ibrahim has also weighed in in the Financial Times - an entire FT online debate on `Is Aid Working' can be found here.    As for the book, Moyo's critique of `old aid' rings the occasional bell with me (e.g. its potential to undermine domestic politics and the state-citizen social contract), but overall, it has been taken to task by Kevin Watkins and Owen Barder among others for highly selective use of the evidence (even by NGO standards...) and dodgy attribution of causality (she argues that since poor countries receive lots of aid, aid must be to blame for theirplight, but as Kevin points out, `using her logic, you could argue that fire engines cause fires because you find them near burning houses' - see cartoon.) The BBC Hardtalk programme also had a good televised head to head with Alison Evans, the new director of the Overseas Development Institute.    But it is Dead Aid's purported alternatives to aid that seem particularly feeble: African governments should issue lots of bonds (not too many takers at the moment - bad luck on the timing there); trust in China (and thus get stuck in commodity dependence, let alone the human rights issues); rich countries should remove barriers to trade (fine, but it won't make much difference except in a few particular products like cotton) and invest in infrastructure (does anyone disagree with that?) and access to microfinance needs to be increased (sure, but it's not even close to a magic bullet).    What is most noticeable is what's missing - the book claims to be about finding better ways to finance development, but she barely mentions taxation or redistribution. Maybe it's that Goldman Sachs/Zambian elite thing coming through again.    Overall, I was intrigued by Moyo's politics/ideology. She manages to combine an entirely understandable resentment to the patronizing ways of aid donors and their crass portrayal of her continent (in Tony Blair's awful soundbite) as `a scar on the conscience of the world', an uncritical celebration of the rise of Chinese and Indian influence in Africa, and a highly conventional international financier's assumption that free capital markets will solve every problem. A kind of third worldist neoliberalism, or right wing version of the old `aid as imperialism' line.    But if the book itself is so flawed, that makes its phenomenal success all the more intriguing. It's clearly hit some kind of chord with leaders like Rwanda's Paul Kagame and other Africans who are sick of being lectured to by western aid donors and rock stars; aid sceptics like Bill Easterly can't believe their luck (see increasingly acrimonious spat between him and Jeff Sachs), and of course any decent journalist relishes a good `man bites dog` story. But the danger is that it will provide useful cover to cash-strapped rich country governments seeking to backtrack on their aid promises, who can now say 'see, Africans say that aid doesn't work, so let's cut the budget'. As for those who disagree with her analysis, (and who in my opinion have rather more evidence on their side) it's almost impossible to avoid sounding either defensive or self interested (this post is probably no exception). What to do to get the debate onto more sensible ground - the very pressing issue of what kinds of aid work, and what don't, and how to reform it? The danger is, Moyo's work will actually squeeze out that discussion. Any suggestions? (I may regret this...)

B001FB4W0W|2.0|I knew about the Sookie Stackhouse books thanks to the buzz about this HBO series. Since I don't have the channel, I decided to buy it on DVD and I bought the books to read them first and I can tell that was a wise decision. I became a big fan of the books, I read them all in 2 weeks and then I watched the series on DVD and one thing I can tell for sure...I'll be buying and reading the future books but I won't be following the other seasons of the series because I'm very disappointed at the many changes they made to the original story.<br />I understand that when you translate a book to a movie or a TV series some things need to be changed, but in this case the changes where so significant that by the final chapters it was a whole different story, an inconsistent one.  A lot of time is spent in some unattractive secondary characters (AKA Jason) and some nice characters of the books (AKA Bubba) are left out entirely and the main story of Bill and Sookie is so short and awkward that I did not feel for a moment the intensity it is supposed to have.<br />I don't want to write a long review about how the book is so different and better, but I do want to say that even if you forget the book and follow the story as it is portrayed in the TV series you find a lot of inconsistencies and flaws. I don't understand why Sookie complains about Bill leaving for the vampire politics when she knows he left to a trial for killing Long Shadow and save her life...she should be concerned about his fate..about the punishment he would face for doing that...since in the book Eric is the one that kills the vampire and faces the punishment without Sookie knowing and Bill in fact left to attend the Vampire elections in New Orleans...it will be understandable that she would be mad and she isn't.  Vampires are proud creatures, at a point in the books Bill confesses that at the beginning he thought it was degrading to have a relationship with a human...vampires and weres don't get along very well either, so the last thing a proud vampire like Bill will do is to ask Sam to protect Sookie...in the book he hires Bubba to protect her (another vampire) and never asks Sam a favor like in the TV series.<br />I don't like the actress that interprets Sookie...physically she doesn't look like Sookie and also I feel like she's overdoing it all the time..at some point I figured if her head would fall to the ground for the way she moves it all the time. I don't see the emotions in her eyes...Sookie is sharp, strong and she constantly talks about how Bill helps her to control the telepathy and how she gets better at that. Sookie looks confused all the time in the series...she looks like someone that doesn't get it.<br />I can keep going on and on....I recommend the books.... read them if you can, they are very good...but if like me you don't have HBO and want to see the series anyway, rent it, don't waste your money buying the DVD that you probably won't want to see twice, so the last thing a proud vampire like Bill will do is to ask Sam to protect Sookie...in the book he hires Bubba to protect her (another vampire) and never asks Sam a favor like in the TV series.  I don't like the actress that interprets Sookie...physically she doesn't look like Sookie and also I feel like she's overdoing it all the time..at some point I figured if her head would fall to the ground for the way she moves it all the time. I don't see the emotions in her eyes...Sookie is sharp, strong and she constantly talks about how Bill helps her to control the telepathy and how she gets better at that. Sookie looks confused all the time in the series...she looks like someone that doesn't get it.  I can keep going on and on....I recommend the books.... read them if you can, they are very good...but if like me you don't have HBO and want to see the series anyway, rent it, don't waste your money buying the DVD that you probably won't want to see twice

0061231401|5.0|The deadly attack of an agriculture site in Africa makes no sense to Sigma Force director Painter Crowe.  He and others high up want to know why even more than who.  Part of the reason most of the political establishment is involved is because one of the dead at the experiential station was a son of a senator.<br /><br />He sends his top unit to Africa.  Commander Grayson Pierce along with Monk Kokkalis and Joe Kowalsk are expected to uncover the truth as the attack was way beyond even that of a terrorist cell as the whole area was flattened even after everyone inside was dead.  The team quickly learns about something called the Doomsday Key removed from Egypt ages ago and brought to England.  This substance allegedly contains a potent unheard of medicine, but in the wrong hands for instance their rivals the Guild could mean the beginning of the end for mankind.<br /><br />The latest Sigma Force thriller (see THE JUDAS STRAIN, MAP OF BONES and THE LAST ORACLE) is action-packed as Pierce and his teammates run all over Europe trying to prevent further catastrophes while their potent rivals want to use THE DOOMSDAY KEY for their gain.  The story line starts off at the speed of light and never decelerates as James Rollins hooks his audience with a wonderful thriller that is based on the concept of how the past impacts the present including the science of today that in turn becomes part of the past impacting the today's of the future.  Complex yet filled with fun, the Sigma Force saga is at its best with this winner.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|We rented this movie this week and the sound was so quiet, we couldn't even watch it! We turned up the TV as loud as it could go (far too loud for anything else we were watching) and still missed a lot of dialogue. The checkout attendant at Blockbuster had the same problem. So did our friend from Texas who came to visit.    You can make it work if you have your TV hooked up to a sound system that can crank up the volume, but if you are watching it on just a TV set, you won't be able to hear much.    If you get this movie, buy a stereo system to go with it.
B0028SVXR6|4.0|Do you hear that? Its the collective crying that occurs after the release of yet another Mars Volta album. You would figure that at this point fans would understand what the Mars Volta are all about. Do they really not yet understand that the band will never give fans what they want but instead will follow their own creative instincts? You never hear a Bjork fan complain when she goes off and does something really strange like on Medulla or Volta and yet the Mars Volta, a band that is clearly hell bent on being abstract and artistic, gets a lip full every time they go in a different direction. Get over it and get used to it.       I guess its customary to bring up the bands past records when speaking of the most current release and the easiest comparison is that this record is 99% ballads. If \\"Asilos Magdalena\\", \\"Miranda that ghost\\", and \\"Televators\\" were some of your favorite songs than you should be right at home with this album.    My number one complaint (and there were very few of them) about The Bedlam in Goliath is that the band never took a moment to relax on that album. With every song being fast paced and loud I longed for those moments on a Volta record where I could take a breather before the next relentless thirteen minute prog rock latin jazz head bopping track would begin. Octahedron is the Ying to that albums Yang. I for one welcome a much slower album that builds to a more meaningful and impactful conclusion.     Cedric's lyrics are more heartfelt and the emphasis he's allowed to give every line really helps a lot. Where this record will truly shine is when they mix these beautiful songs with their other material in their live show. Otherwise its a more mellow but also a more meaningful experience when listened to from beginning to end. To complain is to not \\"get\\" what this band is all about. If you are listening to them you should be more than happy to be surprised on every album. They challenge their fans and it just seems like some fans don't want to be challenged. For them their are plenty of other bland offerings out there. I for one am glad that sometimes it takes a couple of spins to enjoy a track or two.
0762434279|1.0|I LOVE Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but this particular version of the book is a mistake. The book is about 2 inches by 2 inches. You could tie a ribbon on it and call it a Christmas tree ornament. It's too small to really read the book comfortably. So, unless you're a literal rat, trying to get out of the race--go get a REAL unabridged LARGE version of the book.

0385006896|4.0|Sherlock Holmes is captivating. So far, I haven't found the statement \\"Elementary, my dear Watson.\\"  I have heard of some people who have the same characteristics as the character Sherlock Holmes.  Those people thankfully, don't work as detectives.  Most of them are scientists.  The book is brilliant and well done.  Sir Arthur is a genius for his time.  Jules Verne was also of the same caliber.  As for the realism in the book, Jeremy Brett was superb in his role as the Detective and both David Burke and Edward Hardwicke were also superb and distinctive in their roles as Dr. Watson.  There are some distinct and noticable differences in the productions and the book.  For instance, \\"the Mazarin Stone,\\" and \\"the Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax.\\" There is only one story--the Mazarin Stone---Sir Arthur writes as the narrator.  Sir Arthur also writes as Sherlock Holmes in \\"the Blanched Soldier\\" and \\"the Lion's Mane\\".  Of course the first novel---A Study in Scarlet--has a real humour to it.  Since I am from Utah and Sir Arthur assumed so much of the Mormons in early but very poor literature, he really could have used a better education.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Can't go wrong with this collection. Every Beatles fan will enjoy this in their collection.
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|Whether it's your first introduction to the Mozart piano concertos or you've been listening to them for years, this box-set collection by Uchida and the English Chamber Orchestra is a must. I have been listening to Alfred Brendel's collection also recorded under the Philips label for almost twenty years, and whilst Brendel is a brilliant interpreter of Mozart, Uchida definitely brings something new and fresh to these beautiful concertos. Every note, every passge is played in a thoughtful and heart-felt manner, the tempi are appropriate - nothing too fast or slow or idiosyncratic - and the quality of the recordings themselves are brilliant. A couple of the concertos - nos 16 and 19 - are contained over two discs, which was a little disappointing, and the double and triple concertos are not on there, but apart from this, this box set is very well priced and is likely to keep you in good company for a very long time.
B000002UB3|5.0|Has always been one of my favorite albums. Thirty years later it still is great to listen to and sing along with.I love it.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|I've been meaning to come check out the reviews here since this album came out, as I immediately regarded it as one of the best, if not THE best, LoG efforts to date. A lot of long time fans seem disappointed by this album, and when I think about it I guess I can relate. The vocal stylings are pretty different from the old stuff (see \\"In Your Words\\") and for the most part the crushing, heavy wall of sound that characterized their first few records is absent here, in exchange for a raw, dare-I-say more melodic sound. It's difficult to get grasp on. It's noticeable to any novice fan, though, and as a fan since \\"Palaces\\" I can say it's for the better. Sure, they could have just kept churning out the same record, but bands like this typically like to change it up and try the more \\"radio-friendly\\" approach. Make no mistake, though, this album is in NO way radio friendly. Not even close. Fans of the band's previous works need not be alarmed, though, these bands always return to their roots at one point or another. Cradle of Filth is a prime example: they release a record that was more hard rock than metal, and then they go back into the studio and write a record that will melt your face off. Here's an early prediction for the next LoG record: it will sound more like \\"Sacrament\\" and less like the (IMO) superior \\"Wrath.\\"<br /><br />Standout Tracks? The first five are all personal favorites from the band. Of course, \\"The Passing\\" is more of an intro and doesn't really count.
B000053VBL|5.0|This movie is excellent.  As a Truffaud fan this is marvelous with the various methods that she devises to get revenge on those who killed her husband within minutes of getting married.    The only question is how did she find out the names of the five men.      This movie is in the same class as Keeping Mum, with the methods of madness as murders \\"happen\\" and take place quietly.
B000ETQR3Q|1.0|This toy has two components. The front detaches and can be used a compact launcher.<br /><br />The pistol stock has to be attached to the front component. On the toy we received the stock could not be properly inserted. It was clocked by a protruding mold. In a partly inserted state it could not engage the firing mechanism.<br /><br />I had to cut away parts of the rear protruding \\"wings\\" with a sharp knife and a dremel. After removing parts of the plastic pieces I was able, with some force, to snap the pistol grip firmly in place. It is now locked in place and works as designed.<br /><br />This looks like a error in the mold or design, not a change manufacturing slip-up.<br /><br />Once fully assembled it's a fun toy, but I do not recommend purchasing this until you know Hasbro has eliminated this problem.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|If only the God's be merciful. Arrival of BLU-Ray is great, but please, can we have more than two seasons?

I can only guess what's in store on the high def release....
B00297FEUI|5.0|I am a huge fan of the score from the first Transformers. As much as I love that music, I was a bit worried that ROTF might be a rehashing of the original music because it was so popular. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to hear the old themes, but I also wanted the score to progress. IT DID!!!! It's an incredible piece of work. I heard the score before I saw the movie, and it made me want to see the movie even more than I already did. Here are some highlights for me:    1. Prime - Very powerful new theme. Perfect opening to the album.  2. Einstein's Wrong - Really cool intricate track. Kind of surprising at first, but I like it more every time I listen. I love the choir and the rhythms.  3. NEST - I love how Jablonsky used Linkin Park in this track. I'm a LP fan as well, best of both worlds.  5. The Fallen - One of my favorites, a terrific new theme for the bad guy. This one is creepy and very effective.  6. Infinite White - Probably my favorite track. Jablonsky really nails the emotional moments, this track is another example of that. Beautiful singing as well.  9. Tomb of the Primes - Lots of emotion in this track, and it's a terrific moment in the movie (no spoilers!)  10. Forest Battle - Great action cue. The Optimus Prime part at the end is AWESOME! I loved that part in the movie!!  12. Matrix of Leadership - Another very moving track from Jablonsky, I love the use of voice, orchestra and choir. Beautiful, same voice from Infinite White I think.  13. I Claim Your Sun - Heart-pounding action music, probably my favorite action piece on the CD.      COMPLAINT: Why is this CD so short?? I saw the movie, and enjoyed it (too long though!!). I don't know why score CD's are always so short. There were other great moments, like the first time we see Optimus. I wish some of those things were on the CD. Maybe they'll release an expanded score later on???!?!? I hope so.    So far this is my favorite score of the summer. I was really looking forward to this and Giacchino's Star Trek. I liked Star Trek, but was also a bit disappointed that it didn't quite live up to my expectation. So I was worried that Jablonsky would disappoint me as well. He did NOT! Thank you for another terrific score.

B001KVZ6F2|3.0|This is an enjoyable movie, but you must be willing to suspend logic in many places, starting with the premise of the movie - that a local gang is so determined to get this kid to join them that they will do anything. Sure, he is the cousin of one of them, but he is also a wussy young kid. Why on earth would they want him hanging around? Heck, even if wanted to get in the car, it was already full. Whose lap did they want him to sit on?    Then no matter what Walt/Eastwood does to the local thugs, from mouthing off to pulling guns on them to beating them up, the thugs never come after HIM.    And when Walt gets to the porch with his gun in time to witness the drive-by shooting, he not only does not shoot at the bad guys, but he does not identify them to the police. Likewise, the girl who gets beat up does not identify them. Yes, it's been established that Walt doesn't believe in letting the cops handle trouble for him, but then ultimately, [SPOILER:] he leaves the fate of the gang in the hands of the police and the legal system instead of taking care of them himself. With any kind of lawyer, the thugs will not spend a day in jail. Walt was on their property, making threats, and as all the witnesses (who are suddenly willing to talk to the police) will testify, he made a fast motion as if going for a gun. If Walt was willing to die, a more Eastwood-esque ending of going in guns blazing would have made a LOT more sense.    On the plus side, the casting was perfect. Sadly, the self-absorbed, greedy relatives were spot-on. However, a final directing flaw was the WAY too-long pause to build \\"suspense\\" during the reading of the will (\\"and the car goes to...................\\") while the camera focused on the grinning, greedy granddaughter.     If illogical scripts don't bother you, buy it; otherwise, rent it.

B0026J8LHM|3.0|I've been a Dream Theater fan for only about 2 and a half years now (I did start listening to them in 2006 but I didn't FULLY get into them until 2007) but I own a lot of their material. My personal favorite of theirs is Awake, it's their most focused album.<br /><br />I was massively let down with Chaos- It had a few good songs but for the most part, I didn't enjoy it. And Forsaken? Who wrote that song, Nickelback?????????<br /><br />I listened to the leaked version of this and I loved it on the first listen. However I listened to it more and more and then realized how weak it was in comparison to other albums. So having just listened to it again, I'm going to break down the pros and cons of this album:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-The artwork is AWESOME- very dark, very moody, very eerie. It almost reminds me of Octavarium almost. Gone is the simplistic look of Systematic Chaos that sorta irked me.<br /><br />-The songs are dark, fast and heavy- The Shattered Fortress, A Night to Remember and The Count of Tuscany are good examples. If anything, The Shattered Fortress is the best track on the album. It showcases DT's true ability to just shred it and give it all they've got.<br /><br />-Finally, Petrucci and Rudess have stopped making songs that are just them battling against each other. This really Irked me on SC.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-This album's lyrics are TERRIBLE. Enough said. Can Dream Theater stop writing depressing gloom and doom lyrics and just get back to their old lyrical style, in which the songs could be interpreted many ways? Their lyrics have become so depressing I just wanna grab a razor and slash my wrists. Also, THE BEST OF TIMES???? WTH WAS THAT????????? stupid lyrics could have been in a Nickelback song. Seriously, someone needs writers block. EDIT- it's a good thing I have the three disc edition since it has only the instrumental version of that song.<br /><br />-STOP LETTING PORTNOY SING. There was a time when LaBrie would double layer his vocals and on some songs make it sound like there's 2 of him singing, go back to that. Portnoy can't even sing. In fact, yes I do have sort of a grudge against Portnoy- I think he's hella talented, but is a real jerk as a person- as one person said, he really thinks it's cool to drop the f-bomb every 5 seconds. I couldn't even watch Chaos in Motion when a few of my relatives were here since he swears so much.<br /><br />-LaBrie is clearly losing his voice. He needs to hang it up, he's starting to sound bad.<br /><br />In short, this album is not bad, but yeah, they've been going downhill for some time. It's time to hang it up. Hopefully they'll realize when it's right to call it quits.m singing, go back to that. Portnoy can't even sing.

B000Y7U98C|5.0|i was initially drawn to it for three great film reasons - danny boyle, michelle yeoh, and cillian murphy (which goes without saying; he is amazing).  cliff curtis, hiroyuki sanada, and rose byrne were also wonderful - there is not one bad cast member in this ensemble.<br /><br />while the initial story seemed extremely far-fetched to me, since our sun is not the type of star that would 'go out', i decided to suspend disbelief and simply watch the film.  the use of light and sound - both by boyle and the actors, particularly murphy and curtis - is what i found absolutely fascinating and is what kicks this movie past good into great for me.  the portrayal and use of the sun, over and over, draws you in until you cannot wait to see how the film ends.  boyle truly knew how to aim this movie to draw the viewer in by using the sun.  you start to feel empathy with the astronauts/scientists and you want them to win; by the time they need to ensure the jumpstart bomb is deployed, you feel as if you are part of the experience.<br /><br />i was able to let go of facts and enjoy the film - and short of the premise on why they were attempting to jumpstart the sun (ala 'the core' - i saw some vague parallels on the base concept), a lot of the science fiction elements held true to me for our potential 50 years in the future.<br /><br />i was particularly impressed with how boyle used visual techniques for the captain of icarus I to enhance how seven years of solitude, closer to the sun than any human has ever been, slowly drove him away from his primary mission (which is why it failed) and focused that captain's energies towards more metaphysical issues - which not only drives the plot to the end, but boyle manages to keep the film from becoming too violently graphic, which impressed me.  in that resepct, this movie is a very different experience from '28 days later', which i also liked, and proved to me that boyle knows what the script calls for.<br /><br />i also highly recommend buying the DVD to watch it with the commentary on by dr. brian cox - he's great at explaining physics ideas simply without talking down to the listener, gave me a theoretical reason to believe the plot, and points out little touches that i didn't catch at first, but did after watching it again without the commentary.<br /><br />you should buy this just for dr. cox's commentary - it made the film mean much more to me.with the commentary on by dr. brian cox - he's great at explaining physics ideas simply without talking down to the listener, gave me a theoretical reason to believe the plot, and points out little touches that i didn't catch at first, but did after watching it again without the commentary.    you should buy this just for dr. cox's commentary - it made the film mean much more to me.
B001AACEP8|5.0|When 'One of the Boys' was released last year the general consensus among professional music critics was that it was formulaic, and although they weren't wrong, they did not understand that in order to fully embrace it you need to accept that as part of its charm. Katy Perry's career bears a lot of resemblance to Madonna's in her early years. From her modest, religious upbringing to the kitschy, semi-retro fashion sense, the connection between the two is undeniable. \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" made a global impact akin to \\"Like a Virgin,\\" \\"If You Can Afford Me\\" is a cheeky \\"Material Girl' update, and \\"Thinking of You\\" is a poignant teenage ballad anthem not unlike \\"Crazy for You.\\" Perhaps if more critics had made this Madonna-Katy connection, they could have appreciated the genius of 'One of the Boys.' As Madonna has proven time and time again, an artist's humble beginnings do not necessarily define their potential and Katy Perry is certainly a force to be reckoned with.    For anyone hesitating to buy this album, I can assure you there is no bad song out of the bunch and even though a lot of it is contrived, at least Katy draws inspiration from all the right places. The title track brings the attitude and new-wavey bounce of 'Tragic Kingdom'-era No Doubt while \\"Hot N Cold\\" and \\"Mannequin\\" keep the fun-loving spirit of the Bangles and Cyndi Lauper alive. \\"...Afford Me\\" even features a jangly-pop guitar breakdown à la The Cure. And so what if it's been done before? Every generation needs their icons and Katy has the good sense to not fix what isn't broken but instead modernize it and give it her own touch. 'One of the Boys' serves as a reminder that the art of melody isn't dead in the new millennium; the generational fist-pumping anthem \\"Fingerprints,\\" the wide-eyed ballad \\"Lost,\\" and smoldering sadness of \\"I'm Still Breathing\\" are proof of that. \\"Waking Up In Vegas\\" is perhaps the catchiest song of the entire set, building from spoken verses into a loud and explosive crescendo of guitars and percussion in a matter of only three minutes. This is the kind of album that only comes along once in a blue moon and it has so much to offer. Even the leftover recording sessions that have shown up in the form of bonus tracks are worth owning. While this doesn't exactly \\"break the mold\\" or \\"break the stereotype,\\" it certainly shows a lot of promise and it is a good sign that there is still hope out there for pop music aficionados.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I saw this film alone in the theatre, as my wife is Asian, and having seen the reviews, I figured that the dialog and language would be somewhat sensitive and racially charged. I was definitely correct in that conclusion. My father turns 80 this year and easily could have played the role of Walt, a man who has never quite understood the concept of political correctness, or the need to welcome people who his own generation has seen war against.     I can also attest to the spot-on accuracy of the portrayal of the Hmong family. The neighbor matriarch, the family party and the changing roles between the older and younger generations are all shown with absolute clarity. I have been to the exact types of gatherings that Walt was invited to, and the film portrays it superlatively.     I can also appreciate that Eastwood can go beyond the role of Dirty Harry. I am one who believes that Clint is at his best in his deeper, more reflective roles. Think \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" rather than \\"Sudden Impact\\". It is good to see that in the twilight of his career, Eastwood can still show his range.     The ending will not be for everyone, but I think no great movie will be. I think this is a film that will best be appreciated by anyone who has asked the hard questions of life relating to \\"What's next?\\"...the questions that have no clear answer, other than the seeking of redemption and atonement, and the desire to do for others that which they cannot do for themselves. Not a bad way to wrap things in life up, in my opinion.
0060853972|5.0|In my collection of several hundred books of fiction -- many of them science fiction -- this rates in the top ten. I've reread Good Omens once every other year since it first came out. This is so clever and fun and surreal on so many levels that I'm under the impression that the writers are not from this planet. Sort of reminds me of the Douglas Adams books, but certainly this is its own creation.
B00204AA0O|5.0|Great album. One of the best qualities about Regina is that her music evolves. No, Far isn't Begin to Hope. I already have Begin to Hope if I want to listen to it. Far is a masterpiece that stands on its own - and is not a carbon copy of her previous albums. Bravo, Miss Spektor, bravo!

B0013N3DSE|2.0|I own an HDTV set and a copy of the two disk edition of Robin Hood. It was such a well done project that when I saw a Blu Ray version was available I decided to buy it also to see if the image quality improved even more. I was greatly disappointed.    While the feature was a bit sharper many of the extras on the disk are not in 1080 format resulting in picture quality that is less than what you get with the 2 disk special edition. Also the disk is set to start the film on loading bypassing the menu system so you don't have the opportunity to choose to view just the feature or Warner's wonderful NIght at the Movies program.     Using the menu buttons on my remote I found the main menu and discovered it was a terrible mess. Instead of bringing over the well designed menus from the 2 disk edition, there is one huge screen full of words presented. You have to look closely to see the cursor pointing to the choices.     But perhaps the worst thing about the blu ray version is the gallery material. On the 2 disk edition these archival artworks, posters, and photographs almost fill my 50 inch screen. On the blu ray copy the screen is screaming yellow with the artwork appearing as a tiny, almost thumbnail picture in the center of the screen. Result - tiny images that are hard to see against the brilliant yellow background.    It is hard to believe that Warner Bros created this blu ray and the 2 disk edition. Blu Ray is supposed to be the superior format but Warner's Blu Ray release diminishes the wonderful work they did in the restoration of this classic film.    It would be great if Warner redid the packaging of their Blu Ray edition so that it was a better showcase for this film  That's not likely to happen so my advice to anyone who wants to own a copy of this classic film is to ignore the blu ray edition and buy the 2 disk special edition instead.
B000068PQ0|4.0|With the exception of a few meandering segments in its latter half, Yoshimi remains the pinnacle of Lip's art-vs-commerce dichotomy. All the organic electronica steering these proceedings seemed more forced initially than what the years have kindly bestowed- providing incisively produced, and of course heartfelt written, melodies that stick.
0002254433|5.0|Great service with very fast delivery. The book was in excellent condition and priced very inexpensively. The email I received detailing the time frame for delivery (from UK to US) was personable and made me feel like I was the \\"only\\" customer they had. Nice touch! With delivery originating in the UK I fully expected delivery to take a few weeks, but, it came within days. Great experience all around!
B0017PCX20|5.0|Where to start, I first was introduced to The Pineapple Thief with their album 12 Stories Down and was blown away.  I quickly acquired a couple other albums and was equally as pleased with what I heard.  Now after hearing \\"Tightly Unwound,\\" it's clear to me that this group has hit their stride.    Tightly Unwound will certainly be received well by current Thief fans, but more importantly, it will surely attract new fans with its increased accessibility.  The sound is markedly less \\"spacey\\" than their previous releases and eminates that familiar in your face rock n' roll attitude, shown in particular with songs like \\"Shoot First\\" and the epic \\"Too Much to Lose.\\"  But do not fear, this album still has the familiar ambience of previous Thief albums; their scarcity just makes them more beautiful when they do arise!    I do agree that their music shows a clear nod to Radiohead, but (for me at least) they definitely have their own sound that differs from Radiohead in that it is obviously a lot heavier sounding.  Radiohead just can't rock like The Pineapple Thief!    Anyway, BUY THE ALBUM and tell all your friends about it!  This is one of music's best kept secrets and it pains me that the Hannah Montana's of the world are thriving while The Pineapple Thief is stuck in the underground!
0061478784|5.0|Diana Wynne Jones is my all-time favorite author- I was lucky enough to come across Charmed Life in a used bookstore when I was just a kid and I've been enchanted with her ever since.<br /><br />Howl's Moving Castle has every element that makes Diana Wynne Jones the superb author that she is: quirky humor, wonderful characters, an engaging plot, and witty observations are just a few. This book is probably my favorite out of all the ones that she has written, and I can also recommend it as a starting point to those who are new to her. Books in the \\"Strangia\\" world should be read in this order: Howl's Moving Castle, Castle in the Air, and House of Many Ways.
B000006TRV|2.0|First of all there's no dispute that this is a great album. I would give it 4 stars,but this review is not about album content but the remastering of it. I had a cassette version and wanted to buy the remastered version from the year 2000. I received the CD that was remastered in 1994. I know there is a difference because when I set my car CD player dial at 11 o\\"clock I get the maximum sound but when it's not remastered I do not get sufficient sound at that level. I ask the question: Are there two different remastered copies (1994 & 2000) or is The Wall just a victim of bad remastering?

0439023483|5.0|Collins has created a gripping epic of a story, which is an arguably darker combination of the already dark stories 1984, Lord of the Flies, and the short story The Lottery. I certainly couldn't put the book down from beginning to end, however I found myself thinking the text was very dark and not suitable for younger readers. In fact, I was reminded of stories like The Bluest Eye, which is a text involving children as the main characters, but is often banned from various school reading lists and regarded as a book not suitable for kids.<br /><br />That disclaimer aside, this is one of the better books that I've read in a while, and it certainly deserved all the press and awards that it's received. I'm sure that several production studios will consider it for a film, which is bitter sweet in my opinion. This would make a great movie, but it would be incredibly dark.<br /><br />On the literary front, this is a perfect example of a dystopian society, which is the best kind of science fiction. Also, what makes any good science fiction novel really good is the subtle or not so subtle hint that all of the terrible things going on in the story are palpable at some level. It seems a little farfetched that our society could turn into this, but it's not far from where Rome was just before its fall and the degradation of art and culture had reached its limit with rampant incest and duels to the death in the Coliseum. Even now, reality TV is not a far cry from the gladiator games. How long will it be before we want to be entertained by watching people compete by killing each other?<br /><br />However, what makes this book amazing, in my opinion is that Collins has taken a relatively original idea (possibly pulling from sources like the Japanese film Battle Royale) and really flushed it out in a phenomenal way. The great travesty with science fiction and fantasy books is that many of the authors have great concepts, but are terrible writers, leading them to flood the market with books that have great elevator pitches, but are, in reality, not that great. Contrary to popular belief, I don't think that Collins has given us a truly original story, but what made Chaucer and Shakespearre so great, among other things, is that they took well-known stories and rewrote them with their literary genius.<br /><br />The way that Collins writes the story through the eyes of Katniss creates empathy for the reader, and makes the dark world tangible and the characters she's interacting with three-dimensional. Katniss is always believable in every action and decision, making her a reliable narrator, and therefore, making the other characters reliable as well. In doing so, the story's underlying messages are communicated clearly and effectively, showing our own society a mirror of itself and what it can become if we don't start moving in a different direction. I recommend this book to all readers 14+.<br /><br />The other books in this series so far are Catching Fire (book 2).<br /><br />-Lindsey Miller, lindseyslibrary.comelevator pitches, but are, in reality, not that great.

B0026J8LHM|2.0|My English Teacher once advised me on how to write essays - \\" Start Well and End well, and the rest will follow..\\" This has been Dream theaters trend for the past two albums - producing around 40 min of excellent music and a whole bunch of in between I would tell myself wasn't there .     Dream Theater was once a band that wrote great songs (of course) that cohesively came together to form great albums. They were one of those bands that could keep me engaged for 60+ min. However after the release of Six Degrees, they've stopped writing good albums. Don't get me wrong, they've written some of their best music since, just not good albums - And the concept of delivering an all encompassing musical passage that may as well have been one giant song was lost. Soon I found my self skipping through large chunks of the albums to get to what I really wanted to hear .    With this album - I'm not really sure what I'm skipping to. The songs seem uninspired and badly written. Nothing here to match the complexity and beauty of the songs Octavarium or Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. The opening track is decent. A Rite of Passage was written solely for the purpose of being a single. Whither is something you'd expect from one of those contemporary alt rock bands you see on TV all the time - which I don't mind - but don't expect from a band like Dream Theater. Shattered Fortress is at best a shabby mashup, with vocal lines that don't even go over the guitar riffs at points. The Count of Tuscany is a good song. Though I wouldn't go as far as saying its their best since Change of Seasons? Which is a great song, given the context and time it was written but doesn't measure up in musical complexity and sophistication to the masterpieces they've written since.     So what am I rating/measuring this album against?  Previous Dream Theater albums - I'd say this is their weakest release.  Current Progressive Bands - Opeth and Porcupine Tree are currently ahead of Dream Theater in many respects. Opeths last release Watershed, and Porcupine Trees FOABP and Nil Recurring are far better than this release for me.     Current Music in general - This album  is still better than any release this year and is better than anything you hear on radio or see on VH1 :).    Specific criticisms - Other than the song writing itself, the production for me is very poor. The mix is overall very muddy- Cant hear all the instruments distinctively. The drums are really badly eq'd. The base drum has been over compressed (especially in Nightmare to Remember). Dont want to draw comparisons again but Opeth and Porcupine Tree are lightyears ahead in this department.   The singing is very bad. I'm generally a fan of Labries style but in this album he disappoints. Has Portnoy ever heard himself on the record? He sounds like a 14 year trying to sound cool and hip.   The lyrics are questionable. I understand the intention of \\"free verse\\" lyrics , but that doesn't mean you string sentences together paying no attention to the meter the content or the message!     Overall from a fan who was expecting something of the kind of musical complexity and sophistication Dream Theater have shown in the past, I am disappointed. I hope they just make music the way they did with albums like Awake and Six Degrees and not worry about what a million people would think of their music like they have with this one.     Opeth:Francis Bacon ::   Porcupine Tree: Salvador Dali ::   Dream Theater: ?   :)
006135323X|3.0|Daniel Ariely is a professor of behavioral economics at MIT.  This book is a lively recounting of many of his experiments.  While varied, the experiments center on the common theme that humans frequently and consistently behave in an irrational manner.  The book adds to what appears to be a popular genre these days, next to The Psychology of Influence, Freakonomics (Dubner/Levitt), Irrational Exuberance (Shiller),     Some of Ariely's most interesting observations are as follows:    Relativity: We make comparisons on a relative basis, and the most relevant comparisons are the items most similar to the item being evaluated.  When pricing a product, set it up against a similar product that is more expensive to make it look cheap.  When going on a date, go with someone similar to you, but less attractive.  The ratcheting up of CEO pay in recent years is one feature of our tendency to make comparisons - it really took off when enhanced disclosure of pay packages was required.    Anchoring:  We are influenced by an arbitrary starting point (price).  Arbitrary coherence is adherence to an anchor, even though arbitrary.  As a result, first decisions are crucial.    Freebies:  Free is a powerful concept.  In fact, it is more powerful than a mere discount or ultra-cheap price.    Social norms:  We live in two worlds - one of market norms and one of social norms.  We will help a friend move without charge, but expect to be paid for moving people as a job.  Companies sometimes exploit social norms in advertising or in employment practices.    Arousal:  Aroused states cloud our judgment even more than we think they will.     Self-control:  We repeatedly fail at self-control.  If we make pre-commitments, though, we usually do better than if we don't.  Also, simplifying our ability to take necessary actions (i.e. cutting through red tape) makes compliance more likely.    Overvaluation:  We overvalue what we own.    Optionality: We overvalue optionality.  \\"We have an irrational compulsion to keep doors open.\\"  Another version of the problem is that we can find a choice between two similar options very difficult (Buridan's donkey).    Expectations:  Expectations frequently influence our opinions.  We believe referees rule against our team.  Stereotypes are a form of expectation which simplify our lives with useful, but frequently incorrect, shortcuts.    Placebos:  People can be made to believe something works even when nothing was done.    Dishonesty:  We tend to cheat when we can, but typically only a modest amount.  However, we don't cheat as much when we take oaths, when we are reminded of ethical standards, or when cash is involved instead of other assets.    Standard economics assumes rational, informed beings motivated by an accurate concept of the utility of goods and services.  Behavioral economics rests on the fact that people are susceptible to irrelevant influences from their environment, emotions, shortsightedness, and other forms of irrationality.  This book does a fine job of summarizing many of the most common forms of irrationality.
B0026J8LHM|3.0|Let me start off by saying, I am a die hard Dream Theater fan.  I will continue to buy every one of their studio albums, live discs, bootlegs, DVDs, etc.  I've been a fan ever since Images and Words was released back in 92.  However, with each release after Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, I find myself having been slightly let down every time.      Musically, I think that Petrucci and Myung continue to evolve with each album as they are both in prime form. LaBrie is solid as well. But with Portnoy and Ruddess, it is more of the same.  More over the top drum fills, more pompous key solos with that annoying 'dive bomb' thing at the end, and more TERRIBLE Portnoy vocals. While I can ignore these things for the most part (Portnoy's vocals on SDoIT's 'Glass Prison' actually were cool and I could deal with them on occasion) the one thing that really detracts from this album (and every album from ToT on) are the lyrics. It's a shame really because Petrucci/Portnoy have proven in the past that they can write some amazing lyrics (A Change of Seasons, Voices, etc).  But they seem uninspired these days.     The lyrics are particulary terrible this time around. For all its' epicness, The Count of Tuscany just comes off really cheesy.  It is based on real life events that Petrucci encountered a few years ago.  Maybe if I were to hear his story in person, I might get a better sense of why he was so frightened, but the lyrics just come off sounding so overly dramatic.  I mean seriously, you listen to the song and think, \\"really John? So they took you to a castle, told you some ghost stories to give you the heebie jeebies and you really thought you were gonna die????\\"   Gone are the days of I&W, Awake and ACOS.  I attribute this to the fact that Portnoy/Petrucci have discouraged Myung from writing lyrics.  I have always found his lyrics to be the most thought provoking and the fact that he wrote them prior to writing music really challenged the band to push their limitations.  They've gotten lazy and as a result they try to fit lame lyrics/melodies into the music and it just comes off sounding cheesy.      I honestly think that in order to give DT the change it so desperately needs, they really need to have a producer guiding them instead of MP/JP co-producing and just stroking their already over-inflated egos.      It's a shame, this could have been one of their best CDs yet had it not been for such poor lyrics.
1400063736|2.0|This book has got many many good reviews.  I really really tried to get into this book.  I just could not get into McCann's writing style.  I loved the concept of this book, but just did not and could not get passed the prose it was written in.

0694003611|1.0|I got this book because of the rave reviews. When I read this to my 1st child and I think he was about 18 months old at the time, he was scared looking at the pictures. The sleepy 'rabbit' looked so small in the huge room and there where shadows everywhere.    My child could be very sensitive because he was scared when I read 'Cat in the Hat' because the story is about a stranger in the house with the kids! I think at that time, he was between 1 to 2 years old.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I am one of the rare \\"Smallville\\" fans that greatly prefer the darker seasons of late to the light-hearted, freak-of-the-week seasons that the show started with. Season 8 introduced the marvelous Tess Mercer (as excellently portrayed by Cassidy Freeman) who filled the shoes of an MIA Lex Luthor with more charisma and grace than, dare I say it, the great Michael Rosenbaum in the past couple seasons. Also among the characters this year is Davis \\"Doomsday\\" Bloome, who is taken to the next level by Sam Witwer, who plays the role in such a way that the viewers can actually sympathize for the tortured, lonely murderer that Davis has unfortunately become.    There are only two problems that I have with season 8. The first is that around episodes 8.03-8.05, the show lagged. A lot. The episodes, I thought, were quite boring and just not the best work that the \\"Smallville\\" writers have put forth. Specifically 8.03 \\"Toxic,\\" which could've been a fantastic exploration of Justin Hartley's Oliver \\"Green Arrow\\" Queen character but ended up being a bland, practical snorefest.    The second problem is the Lana-arc in episodes 8.10-8.14. While 8.10 \\"Bride,\\" 8.11 \\"Legion,\\" and 8.12 \\"Bulletproof\\" were all outstanding and Kristin Kreuk delivered on every front in her reprisal as Lana Lang, the storyline of giving Lana super powers was extremely unwelcome to most fans (myself included) and, if anything, ruined what could've been a perfect end to the lengthy Clark/Lana storyline that has haunted \\"Smallville\\" since the first episode. 8.14 \\"Requiem\\" is a good episode, mind you, but the poorly done super!Lana storyline brings it and 8.13 \\"Power\\" down as the worst episodes of the season.    Now, there are definitely some blockbuster episodes that were perfect, in my eyes. The entire slew of episodes from 8.15 to 8.21 were brilliant - specifically 8.15 \\"Infamous,\\" 8.16 \\"Turbulence\\" (a brilliant and emotionally raw exploration of the characters - specifically Jimmy Olsen), 8.18 \\"Eternal,\\" and 8.21 \\"Injustice.\\" Watching this season, I was in awe at how much the actors and actresses - and their characters - have grown since they were first introduced to us and I have yet to be disappointed by the work turned in by the fantastic Tom Welling, the outstanding Allison Mack, and the stunning Erica Durance.    Overall, I highly recommend that new viewers catch this season when its on sale and all \\"Smallville\\" fans should purchase this boxset as soon as it's released. As we enter season 9, which may very well be our last \\"Smallville\\" season, I have high hopes that the show will kick it into high gear and go out with a bang.
B00164KYV4|5.0|What I liked most about this movie was that it was just, simply, a good movie. It kept me engaged and the intersted. The characters weren't trite, as they can sometimes be in comedies, especially romantic comdedies. I thought that the actors did a good job and it was an overall good production. I'd recommend it, along with [[ASIN:B001REZM6K Marley and Me (Single-Disc Edition)]].

B001C3KCSY|5.0|I haven't been so enthusiastic about a band since high school (about half a life time ago). This is truly one of the best \\"albums\\" to come out in a long, long, time. Don't you remember the days before singles when the flow of an album told a story or gave you a feeling?, that's what you get in listening to KOL \\"only by the night\\". I can't recall the last time I bought a disc and listened to it exclusively for days. Did I mention that I like it? The lyrics are well thought out and intelligent. A must have for any real music enthusiast.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I received this product promptly and it was inexpensive.  I love the 20 minute workout that fits into my schedule very nicely.  A great product!
B00004RETD|5.0|A must for any Who fan.  Great clips from various tv shows the Who appeared on, starting with The Smother Brothers Show.  Keith Moon is brilliant on this DVD, a MUST OWN for all Who fans!
B002BPQ0Y2|1.0|This is complete plagarized garbage.  \\"I Gotta Feeling\\" is the excat same song as David Guetta's \\"Love is Gone\\" just with different lyrics!!!!! I understand that BEP wants to expand themselves musically, but they cant get away from coping the works of REAL ARTISTS!!!
B000GYI32M|5.0|Wonderful. The item came in better condition than i even expected. (it still had the plastic on it!) Wonderful!
B00192IV0O|1.0|If you consider the new Black Eyed Peas CD a pop/dancefloor album, some of the songs may be pretty catchy. If you consider this a hip hop album, Nas' 2006 release [[ASIN:B000JVSZIY Hip Hop Is Dead]] comes to mind. The ironic thing is that Will.I.Am produced the correspondent track on Nas' CD...
B001LRJH0U|3.0|Ed Harris delivers his second movie with a cast of impressive group that includes Jeremy Irons, Viggo Mortensen and Renee Zellweger.  Set in the wild west, small town of Appaloosa hires two professional gunhandlers to protect town from a group of thugs.  Town can be prosperous since they have train delivering goods, but local business people need order to be brought in.<br /><br />As usual markation of territory begins, we learn that two gun handlers, newly declaired town sheriffs are long standing devoted friends to each other.  They take care of each other and look each other's back.  But as pretty widow comes into town, is their friendship going to sustain itself?  Widow is making a fast moves on one of them and one keeps wondering what is the rush and what are her motives?<br /><br />It is a nice adventure cowboy film, but seems to loose focus on too many occasions.
B001TI4QWA|5.0|This is a fantastic book. Even kids who don't like to read will have trouble putting this book down. In the opening scene, Alex Rider finds out that the uncle who raised him is dead. Then he learns that his uncle was a spy. From that point on, he  narrowly escapes a series of attempts on his life as he tries to finish his uncle's mission.
B000066NW0|5.0|i love avril lavigne so because of that i love her music...plus c'mon they're catchy
B00204AA0O|4.0|Fans get disappointed when their favorite obscure artists do one of two things: 1. Get popular with mainstream music fans (or) 2. Change their sound or style to something deemed inferior to previous work. This is the crime some of Ms. Spektor's long time fans are accusing her of. I say \\"NOT GUILTY!\\" \\"Far\\" is NOT that far removed from her previous efforts. Ethereal, quirky voice, check. Wonderful, mood-altering piano playing, check. Memorable pop/folk (anti-folk?) melodies, check. Beauty and imagination unique to this Soviet born, east village talent: double check. Her albums and songs vary slighty because she doesn't want to repeat herself. In my book, that's a good thing. Check your reservations at the door and check out the new album by Regina Spektor. \\"Laughing With\\" is the catchy yet poignant new single. It (like most of the songs on the CD) will cause you to smile, think and hit repeat...
B001SGEUNI|5.0|This group is hot !!!  In this day and age with so many different kinds of music this group  is ROCK solid.GO Lzzy !!!
0316776963|5.0|The item came in the exact description as was given to me at time of sale.  The book wasn't as funny as the author's other published works but that is okay.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This was the best price for a genuine PS3 controller that I could find. The only thing was I wish it came with another USB cable to charge it with. It's not a big deal though since many digital cameras have the mini USB cable that it requires so you can just use that.
0060012358|5.0|This is one of my favorite Pratchett books.  It is not part of the bigger series, more of a stand alone book, but the story is all Pratchett.  Who else could write social commentary seen through the eyes of a cat and educated rodents?  Kids will enjoy this book, but adults will enjoy it more. Most cleverly and entertainingly written, it leaves you wanting more.  You will laugh, be provoked and of course be left wanting more.  Highly recommended for all.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|The Adventures of Robin Hood is my all time favourite movie, having first seen it about 1950, when I was just a kid. I already had the DVD, which was an excellent transfer. The Blu-ray version is therefore only marginally superior, but has loads of worthwhile extras. For the price it's a bargain - I paid more for the DVD!
B000O76VBG|4.0|I bought this and the Baby Einstein activity keys with the button-activated light at the same time for my 8-month old, and she definitely prefers this one.  The \\"keys\\" are more fun for her to handle and chomp, and the 3 buttons are easily activated, so that she's quickly figured out from accidental presses what they do.  The Einstein button is too hard for her to press, so she still hasn't figured out how to turn the light on.  The three sound effects, each followed by a little tune, are not too loud or annoying for me, and baby likes them.
0596009208|5.0|[[ASIN:0596009208 Head First Java, 2nd Edition]]<br /><br />I wanted to learn Java because of its use in emerging mobile platforms. My previous experience with the Java language was looking at a few applets in 1998. My background is as a procedural programmer, assembly language, Visual Basic and some C#.<br /><br />I understood the concepts of object oriented programming - could even recite the words - but the ability to use the concepts escaped me, until this book. I am now capable of using OO concepts to the extent I know when I could do better. Why interfaces are important was explained very clearly.<br /><br />The other great thing about Java development systems are that they are free. I used Eclipse to work through the programming exercises.<br /><br />The exercises are fun and do cement things into the grey matter.<br /><br />Lastly, how could you not like a book that uses \\"WTF\\"?
0312330871|5.0|I had never read this classic, so my girlfriend bought me a copy to read for our vacation on a small island.  I basically read through it in one sitting and now I understand why Agatha Christie was one of the all-time greats.  The story is a real nail-biter, and the ending is stunning; and everything in between is just about perfect.  The only thing I'd say, in comparing this to other books I've been reading, is that Christie introduces A LOT of characters in the first few chapters, almost too many to keep track of.  I've noticed that more modern books don't do that.  I wonder if people had longer attention spans back in Christie's day.
0596101996|5.0|[[ASIN:0596101996 JavaScript: The Definitive Guide]]<br /><br />I needed a reference guide to JavaScript. I am by no means an expert, I just wanted point solutions that were rather more \\"in depth\\" than the \\"geek boards\\".<br /><br />My success criteria here are: 1. Did it make sense of JavaScript? and 2. More importantly, if I wanted a point solution - was it there?<br /><br />Yes on both counts.<br /><br />I am still new to JavaScript - so I will update this review later.
B0000024JA|4.0|Method Man is one of my favorites from the Wu-Tang Clan, he is one of the most consistant from the clan as well as one of the more humorous members. His syle of rapping is more about drugs as a metaphor for rapping, his name alone should give him a dead give-a-way. This album was the very first solo album to be released after the breakthrough debut \\"Enter The Wu-Tang Clan: 36 Chambers\\" and this was one of 5 albums to be entirely produced by the RZA \\"Tical, Return to the 36 Chambers, Ironman, Liquid Swords & Only Built 4 Cuban Linx\\"...This was The Wu-Tangs prime period but I have to say Tical is my least favorite from the 5 albums. Liquid Swords and Only Built 4 Cuban Linx were classics, Ironman was (in my opinion) Ghostface Killah's best album of his career, and ODB's Return to the 36 Chambers was fun throughout the entire album. But Tical felt a bit outta place, from those other 4 albums.<br /><br />Method Man is probably the most Mainstream artist out of the clan, so its very easy to listen to him. The beats in this album are dark and gritty which is very similar to the sounds you've heard from the 36 Chambers before. Which is why I think its a downfall, its a (I've been here before) type of feeling when you hear all the songs. Still, Method Man's lyrics and delivery are still cool as can be, he is still very funny from time to time, and he is extremely raw in delivery. But I have to give this album 4 stars because its nothing comepletely new but is still considered a classic in my eyes regardless of what score I give this album.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I was a late-comer in the series, but I have been so blown away by the action, special effects, acting, and subplots that I can't get enough of the Winchester brothers.  The first season has set up a lot of episodes that I initially enjoyed, but now see the reasoning or running jokes in the stories.  I now have the first three seasons and look forward to the fourth when it is released.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band Of Brothers.  Item was just as described and fast shipping even with super saver.
B001GCUO1Q|1.0|Wow, i hope the next film is better. This one boasted cheesy effects, typical action movie set ups (come on - throwing a lit cigar on to a gasoline line and walking away in slow motion as the explosion happens behind you - really? Is it time to bring that one back already?) and basic 80's action movie level writing. ('I said 'bub', not 'blob'? - hmmm.)<br /><br />It's like they wrote an origin story of the 'movie version' Wolverine with hints of the 'comic book version' thrown in. Logan found by an old couple on a farm? What is this Superman? In the comic, he breaks loose, kills a bunch of cyber guards and then confronts a grisley bear all the time wearing a cool metallic visor. Dope! In this movie we get to see him cut a bathroom sink and then there's that slow motion bit with the gas line.<br /><br />[...] I mean, the movie takes place in the 1970's after it gets going. Gambit would have been a little kid. And that whole thing with Ryan Reynolds was a disaster for his character and him as a comedic input. Wasted talent!<br /><br />The whole film feels rushed and like it was written by a bunch of 65yr old men who don't read comics, but like Steven Seagal movies. (no offense Stevie) Dis-muthaluvin-Saster!<br /><br />Please make the next one better...Pretty please! Try harder! Hugh, don't settle for Hollywood garbage! Find that unique balance between material that will please the general audiences and the fan boys. Star Trek '09 did.<br />And that could have been a huge misfire.
1593078684|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2ZBO7YIO67AWI]]Dawn: The Worlds of Final Fantasy contains the development sketches of the first four Final Fantasy games, I to IV. All the characters in this book are foreign to me since my first acquaintance with the game was Final Fantasy VII. All with the exception of the monsters and summons which are also used in later series. An index of titles is provided to identify the characters.<br /><br />This is a character design book. Right at the start are a few foldout pages that unfold into larger illustrations. Most of the illustrations are done in pencil and watercolour. The designs are filled with detail although they are really sketches with furry pencil lines. A few black and white designs towards the end of the book.<br /><br />If you're played the games before, you'll see familiar characters like Cecil Harvey, Rosa Farrell and Cid, just to name a few. There are of course lots of creatures -- high level ones -- like dragons, Leviathan, Ifrit, Odin, Bahamut, Chocobo, etc. It's interesting to see how the designs of these traditional legendary creatures have evolved since the first game, which was released in dot matrix. I'm really glad to see that Chocobo is now cuter in the later versions (original Chocobo in the pictures below).<br /><br />There are no game screenshots or highly polished splash pages in this book. All are concept art by Yoshitaka Amano.<br /><br />This book is recommended to character designers and game artists with reservations. Whether you like the book will depend on how much you like the style of Yoshitaka Amano.<br /><br />There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.
1433502402|5.0|It is great, just what I was looking for. I'll use this a long time!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Oh wow! This is an awesome workout. 20 minutes of pure hell (but in a good way). Once you start doing it regularly, it gets easier and boy was I proud of myself when I could manage the first workout without stopping. (ok! maybe just for 5 secs. or so compared to 30 secs initially - lol). Also, its easier to get through with a workout buddy.   I feel fabulous afterwords. I do change this routine with other workout videos, just to keep me interested.Haven't given it 5 starts because the 2nd. workout (that's what I have progressed to) is hard on my 'bad' knee. So I modify it a little, which she does suggest. I still get a good workout though.
0439023483|5.0|Daniella, 8th grader: North America. When you hear those two words, what are the first things that enter your mind? Technology? Hollywood? Fast food? Well, for Katniss Everdeen, a 16 - year - old girl who survives on the animals she hunts, those two words won't bring up anything. She lives in the future, which changed North America into Panem. Panem is separated into 12 districts and it's Capitol. In Katniss' district, which is District 12, the space is barren. District 12 specializes in coal mining, so it's not exactly the cleanest place on earth. District 12 got the worst end of it all since some districts above it live a life that is more luxurious.      Though, in the Capitol, the technology is phenomenal. They've conjured up any type of medication for any type of disease. They had it all. So why would they leave some districts as they are if they had enough money to make it as shiny and spotless as the Capitol? The districts had to produce. And with each district, there's always something different.     Katniss is one tough girl. She knows how to handle things with intelligence and grace. Since her father died in an explosion, her mother has been an emotional wreck. She won't cook for her family and she won't provide for them. So it was Katniss' job to bring food home and onto the table and to take care of her little sister, Prim.      The title of the book says it all. To keep the people of Panem entertained, the Capitol issues a boy and a girl from each district to participate in the Hunger Games, a televised \\" game \\" where the \\" tributes \\" have to compete for the prize - their lives. They are put in a wasteland where you have to fight for all the essential needs: food, water, medicine and weapons. If you can't fight, then you're a goner.      Suzanne Collins really captured true love through Peeta Mellark's eyes. Peeta is the boy drawn for the Hunger Games from District 12. He's had a crush on Katniss since forever. What's ironic is him feeling lucky being picked to participate in the Hunger Games. But only because he would be with Katniss. During the course of the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta strive to keep each other alive, and this shows all the feelings he has for her.      Katniss wasn't actually picked to be in the Hunger Games. Prim was. Katniss couldn't bear to send her little sister there, though. She knew it would be painful for her and her mother to see another one of their family members die, so Katniss stepped up to the plate and offered to replace Prim to keep her safe.      To me, the start of the book isn't that interesting compared to the body and the end. I like reading about romance more than adventure and action, so when Peeta and Katniss were reunited in the Hunger Games arena, it got me biting my nails more than ever to find out if their crushes would blossom into something more. I have to say: I think I have a crush on Peeta Mellark than on Edward Cullen. But they're both different individuals and both have different attractive qualities to them. Peeta would be the sweet boy who's real and Edward would be mysterious mythical creature.      Katniss and I are pretty different. I don't know how to hunt, or how to fend for myself let alone my whole family. She's got a lot of guts to do that. Katniss would conceal her true feelings, whereas I would let mine spill and show. And when it comes to survival in the forest, I wouldn't stop and think twice about eating berries because I'd be too hungry to.      If it weren't for the romance factor mixed in with thrilling adventure sequences, my rating wouldn't be a 4.5. The Hunger Games really captured my attention, but at first I thought it wouldn't be something I would like to read. This book wouldn't really be good for anyone younger than 10 for they wouldn't understand the story as much and there are too much big words for them to know. I, for one, love it and hope after you've read this review would find it thoroughly exhilarating and love it, too.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I got this movie from Netflix. I am die hard Austen fan. I thought the movie was going to be cheesie and it kindda started off that way, but it really suprised  me. I just had to get it.  Really great twists.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|This is a sad, pointless movie.  Perhaps well executed, but why anyone would go to the trouble of producing a story like this for the big screen is beyond me.  I guess it's sort of a politically driven critique of business, religion and the darker elements of human nature but it really offers no profound insights into its subject matter.<br /><br />Very nihilistic, so I guess if that's your bag you might \\"enjoy\\" it, just make sure you are lying on a bed of nails while watching to get the full effect.<br /><br />Basically it's a Scrooge story with the Ebenezer characters (you get two for the price of one, the oilman and the preacher) portrayed in a much more exaggerated fashion and zero redemption.  What a hoot.  If one of the points of the story was supposed to be single-minded ambition can be costly, it fails to show any sort of counterpoint that can be achieved by striking a more reasonable balance in your life.  There is no Fezziwig character in this gloomfest.<br /><br />So overall the story is so outrageously negative I found it hard to believe.  By so intensely focusing only on the darkest moments of the human experience the movie comes across as artificial and inconsequential.  More balance between good and evil would have made for a much better and effective story.<br /><br />I think in reality someone as unbalanced as the Plainview character would not have the opportunity to bludgeon his opponents to death the way the movie portrays.  Even the most desperate acquaintances would stay well away...  which is what I would advise you to do with this pathetic film!<br /><br />The even sadder part is the attention to detail and expense that went into the sets, acting and portrayal of the early oil production process all go to waste.  Come to think of it, the movie itself suffers from an even worse self-centered vanity than its main characters.  The unrelenting, narrow focus and dumbfounding myopia of the story make Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday seem like sympathetic renaissance men by comparison.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|This DVD was purchased as a gift, and the 10-year-old boy loved sharing it with his cousins at their lake cottage, especially being able to use the 3D glasses that were included in the packaging!
B000YABIQ6|3.0|After the 5th episode, I was beginning to think that I needed a drink.  Maybe if I was drunk I'd give this series 5 stars.  No wonder these people drank and smoked their brains out...their lives were so dull.    \\"Madmen\\" is not an exciting piece of work but a nice showcase of the 60s advertising industry and how it influenced and shaped American culture and consumerism. The script, art direction, and acting are intelligently well crafted and depict the facade of the era well. Unfortunately, most of the characters are still forgettable although the character development is obvious throughout. Plus, each episode drags and the delivery couldn't get any less climactic.  It took 10 episodes for me to finally get \\"hooked\\".  The story material is very dense and dry at times.  This series can't be easily watched in one sitting like others.  There are very subtle details that I think the average viewer would have a hard time noticing, let alone appreciating.  \\"Madmen\\" isn't for the average viewer of course.  For me, it was like watching a college sociology thesis put on film.  I found it fascinating and educational but mildly entertaining.  There's enough wit in the dialog that kept me interested.  Episode 9 is by far my favorite.  Worth a look to feed a itching curiosity of the 60s or for those who are looking for a show that is unique and insightful.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Like most pople I enjoyed the first three Indie films. However, I was extremly disapointed with this film. Mostly because I belive The Last Crusade was kind of supposed to be the last of the series. Though they didn't Try to make Ford look younger, which was good, I really don't think that they needed to make a new Indie movie.

B001FB4VZS|2.0|Hello smallville fans I wanted to give my review on season 8. I'm along with the general consenus among Smallville fans that this has probably been the worst season so far. The stories were all over the place, the special effects are pretty much non existent, and the show overall is just nothing like the show I have enjoyed for the past seven seasons.I have never watched a show for this long and now I feel like I want to see how it all ends but it is getting excruciating to watch. The moment I knew this show jumped the shark was when they had a stand in for Lex Luthor and all you could see was a bald head and one eye. Stand ins for actors that have left a show is definitely a sign of maybe it's time to end the show. I have to say if this show can't get better it should end.The most hard to swallow part is how far and fast the quality of the show has fallen in one season. I dont know why a show that is based on a character with 70 years of history behind it cant last for more than 7 seasons without falling into mediocrity. Seriously a character does not become an American icon without depth. This season has more filler episodes than episodes with some purpose to the season's overall story arc. It's like they had more episodes than ideas for episodes,how the hell does that happen with a 70 year old character.  In conclusion I will watch next season and buy this season's DVD to have the complete series so far but I cannot recommend this season to anyone other than for the same reason I am buying it.
1416914285|5.0|This book had all of my favorite elements. It was fast paced, snappy dialogue and characters that are well rounded. Also, it was not overly descriptive, which for a book of almost 500 pages, is just amazing. This is a great summer read for anyone who likes urban fantasy and wants to escape to an alternate world. This book just flew by and I had to go back to the library to get the second one, City of Ashes.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|This is a wonderful, beautifully written story of two loyal, polar opposite friends.  Lennie a tall, strong, slow, gentle giant, is looked after by his friend George, a short, clever little man.  They make their way together all over the country searching for jobs and trying to achieve their dream of owning their own piece of land.  Lennie does some \\"bad things\\" and keeps losing both of them their jobs.  George sticks by Lennie and looks after him nonetheless.  They finally end up at a ranch where they meet some interesting characters.  There is the taunting, head-strong Curley, his harlequin wife, the tall authoritative Slim, the lonely Crooks, and the tired out Candy, all excellently portrayed by Steinbeck.  The power of friendship, the woes and dreams of all men, and the outside forces that combat with all of us are present in this epic novel. Beautifully written with a surprising yet appropriate ending, a must read for all.
1439157383|5.0|Having just graduated college and finding time to finally read for pleasure, I went to Wal-Mart and grabbed whatever the read of the month was.  My Sister's Keeper happened to be it.  This novel was very well written.  When you read from one character's point of view and wonder how the circumstances make the other characters in the story feel and react, you are not let down by this book.  Every major character is the narrator at some point or another. Very moving, touching story that is not too predictable.  Couldn't put it down until I was finished.  I recommend this book to everyone!
B00204AA0O|4.0|Regina Spektor's new album, Far, is both brilliant and disappointing. And the 7th track of the album, \\"Human of the Year\\" is representative of this. The beginning of the song is Regina at her worst - she tries too hard with the vocals, forcing certain notes for far too long to the point where its no longer quirky, but annoying and harsh on the ears.     But the 2nd half of the song is one of the most wonderful pieces of music I've ever heard, and exemplifies Regina at her absolute best. Mysterious lyrics, a slight off-beat, and a unique singing style all come together and complement each other in a truly fantastic fashion.    Thus, I feel that the entire album reflects this nature. Some songs are good - Two Birds, One More Time with Feeling, Eet, Blue Lips - and really reflect a great mesh of mainstream production with Regina's style. Others are just plain bad - Laughing With, Folding Chair, Wallet - as Regina shoves down your throat certain notes and lyrics.    I think its an album that will grow on me, and I do recommend you buy it; after all, I was wary of Begin to Hope, but think that it is a fantastic album now. But Far is too inconsistent, and I feel like it could have been better.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Without getting technical, this is a great collection of the first six Star Trek films. Impressed with the quality of each, the movies have never looked better. Plus incredible amount of bonus features and the seventh disc is very interesting and well done. For the price, can't beat the amount of quality entertainment in this collection. Paramount did a good job, it's not a cheaply produced set. I for one appreciate having the original theatrical version of the films, most not available until now. Directors editions would be nice, but later down the road is fine with me.
068987474X|2.0|Greg is suggesting that all good relationships begin with love at first sight - the two are completely smitten with each other from the get go and that if this does not happen then then nothing will ever happen...    Look at all the relationships around you and ask yourself how often this is the case?  I believe that love can grow over time as people get to know each other.  I'm not saying that if you're into a guy you should keep calling/stalking him when he's not getting in touch with you - I'm just saying that it's not always as clear cut as Greg suggests.    He's also forgetting about shy guys who are totally into you but would rather live a loney life then risk the embarrassment of being rejected.  And there are many of them.    Quite entertaining, light, magazine like reading though which is why I give it the second star.
B000N6TYLW|1.0|I have been such a fan of this show - the quirky characters and town are the best part of the show, the writing and fast-paced dialogue are better than most other shows on tv. That said, I am only half-way into this season and can already see what's coming. It is SO disappointing.    Stars Hollow and its characters are absent from most of the content - and the show has lost its soul.     There is something wrong with either the set or the filming; it doesn't feel like the same place and the seasons don't work. If it is winter on the east coast, why do the trees have leaves? Why is the grass still green?     The breakup between Luke & Lorelai was sad but believable in the last season. Luke's struggle for custody is a believable plot point. I was happy when Chris reentered the picture, thinking maybe this shows some maturity and self-reflection on Lorelai's part, in terms of relationships. It would have been nice to see the relationships of mother/father/daughter/grandparents come full circle from the beginning of the series. But no, these people never learn from their mistakes. I liked Lorelai in the beginning but she has always seemed much too self-absorbed to have a successful relationship. I found myself getting more and more annoyed with her as the series progressed. Now she destroys her relationship with the father of her child - in spite of all previous seasons when they said they had each others' backs.  As much as I like Luke/Lorelai dynamics, I find it hard to believe that he could fit into her world and be happy.     In the end, as off-putting as the grandparents could be, they seem to be the ones who have solidity and strength of character.    Already, I wish this season could be eliminated and re-done with the original writers.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|With the plot of \\"Jumper\\" recapped several times throughout this Amazon review section, let's just \\"jump\\" right into my thoughts on this little bugger. Blink-and-it's-over movie, blink-and-it's-over review... appropriate no?  Anyway, away we go...<br /><br />This fast-paced (but not ridiculously fast-paced as the trailer seemed to indicate) \\"X-Men\\" style adventure is worth a look for its solid premise, edgy characters, and exciting confrontations.  I especially liked the occasional nods in the direction of character complexity: Hayden Christensen's \\"Jumper\\" character maybe isn't the basically nice guy he initially seems to be and Sam Jackson's relentlessly hunting \\"Paladin\\" character maybe isn't really as bad as HE initially seems.  In other words, maybe Jackson's character is right and all past jumpers HAVE become rotten eggs- dangerous rotten eggs- after a while, and need to be put down.  Clearly much was left open for exploration in a sequel.<br /><br />Strangely, some of that exploration could have been done in this very movie, as it's only an hour and twenty-nine minutes long.  Could it have killed 'em to give us ten more minutes of character material and background info to supplement the generous (and, admittedly, very well done) action sequences?  At an hour and 40 or 45 minutes, this movie would still have been lean and mean, but also a little richer.  Still, \\"Jumper\\" is worth a look for fans of super-powered characters and gritty adventure.<br /><br />The DVD features a full screen print on one side of the disc and a widescreen print on the other.  A variety of engaging special features pepper both sides of the DVD.<br /><br />Review over.  Quick, huh?  Time for me to jump outta here...
0060730552|5.0|In every genre, there are books that set the bar.  Touching the Void sets the bar for survival tales at a dizzying height.  I chow down on outdoor adventure stories regularly, both historical and contemporary.  From Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air to Apsley Cherry-Gerard's The Worst Journey in the World, I've stared goggle-eyed at the pages that illustrate the human capacity for endurance, and document the raw will to survive some men/women radiate.  Touching the Void rocked me back on my heels.<br /><br />Touching the Void is more than a survival tale.  The ethical dilemma of what to do when a fellow climber's injury puts his partner's survival in jeopardy has never been discussed more eloquently. One human's choice to survive has rarely, if ever, been detailed in more harrowing and excruciating detail.  There are many tales of climbers on Everest, intent on their one shot at the tallest peak in the world, walking by injured and dying climbers without offering assistance.  Touching the Void provides a similar dilemma in a uniquely personal and horrifying way.<br /><br />My book group (six couples) couldn't shut up about this book, even though none of us are climbers.  Why?  Because author Joe Simpson powerfully casts the irresistably baited hook \\"What would YOU do if YOU were in this circumstance?\\", and the twelve people in our group bit, and bit HARD.<br /><br />If you are a reader of outdoor adventure, your reading list is simply incomplete if you haven't read this.  If you're the type that thinks outdoor excursions should be confined to mad dogs and Englishmen, read it anyway.  It will change the way you think about human capacity, and your own capabilities.  If I was all thumbs, this book would get a ten thumbs up!
0060558121|5.0|Quite possibly one of the best books I've read in a LONG time.  I'm so glad I read it, unfortunately, it has ruined me for other books.  Gaiman's imagination is incredible.  The plot is unpredictable and utterly enjoyable.  I envy anyone reading this book for the first time.  (By the way, if you enjoyed The Watchmen, this is right up your alley).  After you read this book, check out The Messenger by Zusak.  It's young adult, but it wonderfully written, too.
055357342X|5.0|I have been buying books from Amazon since the site opened and this is the first review I am writing.    This series is outstanding. It effectively explodes all the conventions of the hackneyed, formulaic and boring Sword and Sorcery genre. Where The Lorf of the Rings is black and white, ASOIAF is all grey areas and realpoltik.    Do youself a favor and buy all five books.
1439157383|1.0|When I was done with this book, I wanted to take it over to my BBQ and ignite it.  If you like to read, don't waste your time.  This book is horrible.  It felt like the author had to rush to get it to her agent.  It had a ludicrous scooby-do ending.  My wish is that someone reads this review and saves their money.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|This cd is just awsome. Riot is very catchy, but my fav. song on this one is Let It Die. VERY impressive . Good job TDG.
B001CDLATE|4.0|First, I want to note that this disc didn't work in my Sony Bluray player.  I was deeply disappointed, but I didn't want to give it up, so I set it aside in the hopes of getting it to work someday.  I eventually figured out that I could connect the player to the internet and update its firmware, and that got Baraka working.  If your player has trouble with this disc, see if any firmware update is available!    As for the movie. . .  I see that people who buy it often get 2001: A Space Odyssey too.  Good call!  With Baraka's stunning cinematography and lack of any dialog or narration, I was reminded of 2001, especially the opening \\"dawn of man\\" sequences.  Maybe this film should have been called 1993: An Earth Odyssey.    Most of the images are beautiful, some are stunning, many are thought-provoking, and the soundtrack is an excellent match for it all.  I shouldn't have to repeat the praise that many have already heaped on Baraka -- it's all true.  However, I also have to quibble with Baraka, because it has philosophical axe to grind.  The unsubtle theme is that industry destroys the Earth, modern life is dehumanizing, and we'd all be better off returning to the forest and becoming oh-so-wise-and-happy stone age hunter-gatherers.    In fact, one of the best ways to describe Baraka is by telling what it isn't.  If any of you have seen the TV series \\"Modern Marvels\\", just imagine the polar opposite of that.  MM is homely, Baraka is beautiful.  MM is prosaic, Baraka is sublime.  MM explains, Baraka shows.  MM thinks, Baraka feels.  And then there's the underlying message. . .  Modern Marvels is a paean to technology, industry and progress.  Baraka is a condemnation of those things.  My own philosophy, I have to say, is more in line with Modern Marvels.    In short:  I adored Baraka, but I also have to take it with a grain of salt.  I suggest you do the same.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|i recommend this series to anyone who love watching shows about vampires. i am also watching the second series. it is awesome
B001U6YI92|5.0|The quality of this blew me away. This is one of my all time favorite movies and now to see it in crystal clear blu-ray is FANTASTIC. It's as though it was just filmed. Hard to believe it is from the 60's. Do yourself a favor and add this to your collection!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is great.  I am shocked that some reviews said that this workout is not for beginners.  I am a smoker and 70 lbs overweight and I didn't really have a problem.  Oh, it's hard, don't get me wrong (very hard), but if I can do it, most anyone can.  I found Jillian to be quite motivating.  This is the first workout plan I've actually been able to stick to.  She is great at giving cues that allow you to estimate how much time is left in the video.  And it's only 20 minutes.  Perfect.  After the first day I did this video I didn't think I was going to be able to do it again the next day I was so sore, but I did it anyway, and it really paid off.  It has gotten way easier just in the few days that I've been doing it.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!  Especially if you have motivation issues (I know I do!).
1881273156|5.0|This book is excellent.  I had taken it out from the library and thought it so informative that I wanted my own copy, which is why I purchased it from Amazon.com.  Dr. Chapman is very insightful with his descriptions of people's love languages - words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch.  Additionally, the examples he shares for each type are easily identifiable and understood.  The book a great tool for improving both intimate and casual relationships.  Furthermore, it is a \\"good read\\" that holds one's attention.
B002DD46P2|4.0|I would like to begin by saying that I am a huge fan of film scores in general.  I thought the score for the first film was excellent and really added to the \\"soul\\" of the Transformers.  There was the required generic action queues but there were also some genuinely heart felt heroic moments as well.  In particular, tracks such as Autobots, Arrival to Earth, You're a Soldier Now and No Sacrifice, No Victory really stood out.  I have listened to this album a few times now. I have to say that although it is good, it is not quite up to the level of the first score in the sense that there are not those same soaring heroic moments.  There are a few such as the ending of the Forest Battle track that show glimpses of this heroism.  The sad thing is that the score as heard in the film is far superior to the album version in terms of the material that is offered.  There are a number of queues that are fantastic but apparently didn't make the final cut.  Perhaps this is symptomatic of the movie itself.  I liked it but it was overly long and generic in some parts and the score, in some ways, reflects that.  I rated it 4 stars because it is a great effort it just doesn't quite match the highest highs of its predecessor.
0765356147|5.0|I disliked a lot of things about Elantris (Sanderson's previous work); mostly having to do with some of the characterizations and writing techniques of the author.  But I liked enough about it to give him a second try, in hopes that his storytelling ability  would steady up and flesh out to match his amazing imagination. After reading the Mistborn trilogy, all I can say is \\"Wow!\\"  He keeps his characters true to themselves, and to his assertions of their nature.  He built a nice tight, consistent story where everything that happens makes sense.  He gives us several wondrous payoffs.
B000IOUCO2|5.0|Between the plagues and constant warfare, it's amazing that anyone in Europe survived the 14th. century.
B00003CXXR|5.0|My daughter needed a VHS of \\"Jurassic Park III\\" to complete her set.  Our entire family, adult to grandchildren, has enjoyed the exciting action in this movie.  Our thanks to zorich214 for supplying a perfect, new VHS and service that was above and beyond.
B001FB55H6|1.0|This movie was awful. It sounds like the comic series is good (from what I have heard), but the movie was absolutely awful. My wife and I could not ascertain what the plot of the movie. The gratuitous gore and sensuality seemed disjointed and thrown in at random. The special effects were done very well, but the \\"acting\\" and plot seemed haphazard at best.
0375826726|1.0|This series has no right to sit on the shelves of bookstores next to classics such as King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, what Paolini has done is destroy other authors beautifully written material for his own material gain. A fool who has sheep who no no better for fans. I beseech all of you to read the classics of the genre, books worth reading, such as Tolkien and C.S. Lewis, there books truly are the best, especially when you compare them against this prentender. Put down Brisingr, Eldest, Eragon, and pick up a classic, you might find yourself largely surprised at how much better they are.
0143114085|4.0|Alice Fancourt has a two weeks old daughter, Florence. She leaves Florence at home, goes to enroll in the expensive health club (a gift from her imposing, devilish mother-in-law, Vivienne), and when she comes back, she starts screaming. Florence has been swapped for another baby, even though David, Alice's husband, was at home. David is adamant that Florence is still Florence and not another baby, yet Alice calls the police and reports the abduction. Nobody else is sure of the baby's identity. Is Alice insane? Is the baby really missing? Things are not really what they appear...<br />When one week later Alice and the baby disappear, Detective Simon Waterhouse is desperate to solve the case...<br /><br />Sophie Hannah's debut novel is a type of book, which strongly appeals to emotions rather than provide entertainment or intellectual challenge. It is true that the mystery plot is not perfect and it is easy to guess pretty quickly who is the main villain (although there are some minor surprises). Having said that, I would like to point out its strong points, which, to me, make up for the genre imperfections. First of all, the characters are really interesting. I am in love with Simon, and expect him to reveal more of himself in the next books. Charlie, his direct superior, the Sergeant, is also interesting, although not very likeable. The Fancourts are types rather than individuals, but they feel very real and make the whole story plausible. Next, the social aspect and background are great and I think the good mystery novels should really get into society problems in a touching way (look at Mankell or Leehtolainen; generally the European mystery authors are doing a good job at that). Last, but not least, the language is great - gripping and suggestive. It probably helps that the author is a poet.<br /><br />I could not put \\"Little Face\\" down and finished it in one evening, I was very moved by the story and definitely will continue my acquaintance with Sophie Hannah's prose.
0061537969|2.0|I was tremendously excited about reading a fresh novel with such glowing words said about it.  After reading the first two pages in a bookstore, I committed it to my shortlist & got it from the library the following day.  The Art of Racing in the Rain captured my attention from the start.    Enzo is really an intriguing character.  As an old dog, he exhibits a very human intelligence with a distinctly un-human perspective... he discovers the weather channel, he learns from his master the intricacies of racing, & he describes the smell of impending cancer.  When Enzo is talking about the world from a dog's perspective, I am digesting every word with a smile.    But this novel is not all that much about the dog.  Yes, it is told from his perspective, & it comes with its share of narrative gems.  Far too frequently however (say, 80%), the book regresses into the standard family soap opera, a barrage of tragedies.  Anything unique that could be gleaned from the dog-as-narrator is lost in the melancholy plot.  Worst of all, the writing was absolutely unremarkable.  Even at its best, when Enzo is sharing his life philosophies & insights about himself & human-dog dynamics, there is no power to Garth Stein's authorship.  I was weary of the writing style by page 40.    I see a lot of unrealized potential in Enzo.  He's shrewd, smart, & enlightened... self-actualized, really.  But I could not connect with the bland story, & the writing was completely lacking in imagination for me.  It is, however, an easy read, only three hours or so, so checking it for yourself at your library would not be a huge investment.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|From the moment I heard Deloused I have loved this band.  They have put out nothing but stellar albums and this one is no different.  Live, they absolutely dominate.  Omar is a rock guitar hero and Cedric is an A rated frontman.  I don't think their music is for everyone and I can easily see how people dismiss them so easily, but thats what its like with most things in life.  With the recent release of the new John Frusciante, new Mastodon and new Isis, 2009 is looking to be quite a year!    Love them or hate them, the Mars Volta are a very creative, powerful and mystical force!
B001GMH8TM|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE \\"BLU RAY\\" VERSION OF THE FILM***<br /><br />Watching Peter Weir's 1998 film in 2009 is a weird and wonderful trip - if not a slightly disconcerting one at times.<br /><br />First - it's as masterful and brilliant as you remember it - a very clever unfolding story about a man whose life is permanent Candid Camera for the entire planet - living in an artificially created world with literally everyone around him being an actor. Then there's the stunning and believable performances of a perfectly picked cast (Carey, Linney and Harris all shine). And second - with the appalling Big Brother polluting our airwaves night after night - \\"The Truman Show\\" is not just relevant eleven years later - it seems to have actually predicted our television future...<br /><br />But back to the BLU RAY - the first thing you notice is the picture, which is a mixture of beautiful clarity one moment running alongside very steady DVD quality the next. Clarity highlights would include - - Noah Emmerich's sea of freckles as he's interviewed in the opening credits - he plays Marlon who is supposedly Truman's best friend - always turning up with a \\"Brewsky\\" whenever there's a problem (they actually cake and paste Noah's face with make up to cover up his freckles in later shots). There are the pearls on Sylvia's wrist in the library when Truman and her finally talk, the \\"How Does It All End?\\" button on her cardigan - stunning clarity. There's Truman digging the garden in his horrible orange pants as his wife stops on her bicycle for a little product-placement (played superbly by Laura Linney)...<br />\\"Look Truman! Chef's Pal! It's a Grater, Dicer and Peeler all in one!\\"<br />\\"Wow!\\"<br /><br />You also notice the actors who went on to be huge stars, Paul Giamatti as Christof's technical sidekick, Peter Krause from Six Feet Under and Dirty Sexy Money as one of the suits in Truman's office and of course the ethereal beauty of Natasha McElhone who has eyes clinically proven to be deeper than the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />Harry Shearer is in there too doing a fantastic turn as the appeasing interviewer Mike Michaelson. There's the crass reintroduction of Truman's dead father, which is being choreographed live by manipulative experts in the overhanging control room (quote above). But the trump card is the last minute cast appointment of Ed Harris as the show's all-powerful creator - the aptly named Christof. Harris is simply magnificent (nominated for an Oscar) all serene and quietly spoken one moment - but dictatorial the next when his little money-making baby and power trip start to get challenged by an unexpectedly spunky Truman - a man Christof's personally trained to be scared of certain things so he won't ever leave Seahaven...<br /><br />The two extras are the same as the Special Edition DVD - so a little disappointing there. But that's minor compared to how good the whole film looks on BLU RAY and especially how amazingly well it still stands up - a modern day masterpiece. And the scenes where Truman stops the bus in defiance and where he battles the storm on his boat trying to break free brought tears to my eyes - fabulous stuff.<br /><br />\\"You can't get any away further away before you start coming back...\\" Truman says to Marlon about Fiji where his longed-for love Sylvia is.<br /><br />It's slightly disconcerting to find a movie character spouting such wisdom, because in 2009, our entire world feels like one big screwed up reality show that can only end badly...<br /><br />What a film! And a triumph on Blu Ray - Recommended.n.     Harry Shearer is in there too doing a fantastic turn as the appeasing interviewer Mike Michaelson.

0316017922|5.0|Since I am a college student, I have been trying to read bestsellers' books. This one is one of top five books that I recommand.
B0024RID6U|5.0|With the old Virgin 1994 remaster and this new 2009 Polydor version 'both' clocking in at exactly 44:26 minutes, I immediately had my suspicions about this latest rehash masquerading as something new for soppy Stones fans like me and a million others. But this 2009 Polydor CD is a FANTASTIC IMPROVEMENT in sound over its 1994 predecessor - it really is...<br /><br />If I were to nail down what's different - it would be the BASS and DRUMS. They're suddenly so clear now - and in some cases like \\"Worried About You\\" - it's truly startling how good they sound. In fact if feels like every single track has been uplifted out of its former rhythm section muddiness. The clarity and punch is great on everything really. STEPHEN MARCUSSEN and STEWART WHITMORE at Marcussen Mastering in Hollywood, California did the transfers and they're to be praised for their work...<br /><br />As you've no doubt already read, \\"Tattoo You\\" was a ragbag of outtakes from previous albums with a few new tunes thrown in - Rockers on the A with Ballads on the B. Yet it worked - I played it to death on release - loved it - especially the soulful Side 2.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new packaging is a bit of a joke. The 'furry boot' inner sleeve that came with the original LP is reproduced in a paltry gatefold inlay, but there's no lyrics (there's a European LP that has a lyric sheet insert - they could have used that). The startling Christian Piper tattooed 'Three Paintings' are reduced to a point where the credits on the green-coloured rear sleeve are barely legible. The inlay beneath the see-through CD tray is blank - wow - push the boat out boys! But much worse - and like so many Stones LPs - guest musicians who contributed incredible work at the time are now not mentioned on reissues at all. So with all that in mind, here's a detailed breakdown to get a better lay of the land...<br /><br />1. Start Me Up [begun in 1975, returned to in 1978 as a \\"Some Girls\\" possible]<br />2. Hang Fire [another \\"Some Girls\\" outtake, features IAN STEWART on Piano]<br />3. Slave [This is an Extended Version - see PS below]<br />4. Little T&A [Lead Vocals and Bass by Keith Richards, Ian Stewart on Piano - T&A is street slang for certain parts of a woman's anatomy]<br />5. Black Limousine [the only track on the album co-credited to RONNIE WOOD, it features Mick Jagger on Lead Vocals and Harmonica with Ian Stewart on Piano - backing track dated as far back as \\"Exile\\" in 1972]<br />6. Neighbours [features' both' the legendary SONNY ROLLINS and BOBBY KEYES on Saxophones]<br />7. Worried About You [features BILLY PRESTON on Piano, WAYNE PERKINS on Lead Guitar and SOLO and OLLIE BROWN on Percussion]<br />8. Tops [features MICK TAYLOR on Guitar with NICKY HOPKINS on Piano; a Mick Taylor \\"Exile\\" outtake - wasn't given a writers credit - sued and won]<br />9. Heaven [co-producer CHRIS KIMSEY plays Piano on this]<br />10. No Use In Crying [features Nicky Hopkins on Piano]<br />11. Waiting On A Friend [features Mick Taylor on Guitar, Sonny Rollins on Saxophone and JIMMY MILLER of \\"Sticky\\" fame on Percussion]<br /><br />The clarity of the guitar solo on \\"Slave\\" is awesome as is the swirling magic of \\"Heaven\\", but best of all is the beautiful axework by Wayne Perkins on the Side 2 opener \\"Worried About You\\". I think it's the best guitar solo on a Stones album anywhere and its clarity now is fabulous.<br /><br />To sum up - I know the packaging and presentation leave a lot to be desired, but as I listen to the lovely Piano tinkering of Nicky Hopkins on \\"No Use In Crying\\" and the three lads harmonising on Backing Vocals - I don't care - I love it. The sound is wonderful and a major improvement over what went before.<br /><br />The buggering truth is that once you hear these remasters, you're screwed - you'll have to have them all... Damn!<br /><br />Despite niggles, it's recommended - big time.<br /><br />PS: there's an anomaly worth noting...<br /><br />When \\"Tattoo You\\" was originally released on Vinyl and Cassette in August 1981 (Rolling Stones CUNS 39114 in the UK and COC 16052 in the USA), the 3rd track on Side 1 \\"Slave\\" clocked in at about 3:20 minutes. So when the first ever CD version of it came out on CBS in 1989 it naturally reflected that timing.<br /><br />However the May 1994 Virgin remaster put out an anomaly without telling anyone - their CD version was inexplicably extended to 6:31 minutes - that error is repeated here - and very much to the benefit of fans because the \\"Extended Version\\" of \\"Slave\\" is sensational. With the legendary Sonny Rollins playing on Saxophone and Billy Preston on Keyboards, the lengthy mix now sounds like \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" Part 2 from \\"Sticky Fingers\\". A huge chunky guitar riff throughout, great Jagger vocals, Sax wailing - it absolutely rocks (apparently there's a version with Jeff Beck on guitar in the can somewhere too).<br /><br />What should have happened here of course is that the original LP timing be used on this CD - with both the Jeff Beck mix and the Extended Version put on as bonus tracks at the end, but that's for another day and another reissue...k on Side 1 \\"Slave\\" clocked in at about 3:20 minutes.

B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I saw Blind Faith at MSG when they appeared there some 40 years ago and last year I had the opportunity to see the heart and soul of that group again! What great luck to witness these two masters at work. They sound better than ever. Steve's vocals, guitar and Hammond mastery was as wonderful as ever. Sharp and right on target! No unusual for him, but maybe he was further inspired being along side his long time friend and musical genius Eric Clapton. Eric's playing was sharp, lightning fast and as melodic as he has ever put out. And they were having fun and it shows on this recording.   VooDoo Chile is to me the show stopper but there are no weaknesses here.  'Had To Cry Today', 'Pearly Queen', 'Mr Fantasy', 'Low Down' and 'Well Alright' also score huge. Every song was well-chosen and performed to the max. They were loud that night at MSG, but the recording is very well-balanced making it almost as enjoyable as being there.   DO NOT MISS THIS ONE!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I ordered the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice along with the Firth/ BBC versions because I love this Jane Austin story and because of \\"Toomuchtimeonmyhands\\" review. I have not yet played the Firth/ BBC versions, so I will review them later. I was so disappointed when I opened the Keira Knightley DVD and found sticky goo all around the center opening on both sides of the DVD! I am trying to return it now, but so far the return links do not work. I am awaiting an email reply for resolution. Check your products carefully as soon as they arrive, since the vendors obviously do not.

All fantastic DGG recordings - Schumann, Rachmaninov, memorable recitals Haydn/Chopin/Debussy/Prokofiev/Scriabin/Bach/Schubert etc are included and this set is essential for any new Richter fanatic - here company is really offering value for money. I really appreciate first time cd combination of Prokofiev 5th concerto and Mozart 20th concerto - fantastic, imaginative combination of two great works and original disarming putto cover. There are no weak links in this box if you only could take Richter/Karajan battle of the spirits in Tchaikovsky concerto as a curiosity.

0061673730|5.0|Robert M. Pirsig's classic, \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values,\\" is an enjoyable, intriguing, and thoughtful publication.  While first published in 1974, this book is as relevant today (2009) as it was when it was first printed.<br /><br />Written as a \\"narrated novel,\\" this book delves into the differences, and commonalities, of art and science.  Using a cross-country motorcycle trip as a backdrop, Pirsig considers the essence...and limits...of science and compares the field to that of philosophy in broad terms.<br /><br />More than anything else, this book's unique value centers on the questions and perspectives it opens up.  While readers can benefit from Pirsig's view on the scientific method, for example, the real \\"learning\\" in this publication is that the seemingly disparate viewpoints of art and science can be united in a purposeful and useful manner.<br /><br />This publication enjoys an enduring following and offers much to readers with an interest in learning about philosophy in an applied...and engaging...manner.
0345472322|5.0|This book mainly analyzes two different mindsets: (1) the fixed mindset and (2) the growth mindset.  The fixed mindset views the only ingredient for success is one's natural talent which is fixed. The growth mindset views success as a result of growth, learning, and hard work.  As a result, people with the fixed mindset are afraid of challenge and whenever they do something, the purpose is to prove their intelligence.  To them, effort means one is not talented enough.  On the other end, people with the growth mindset enjoy being challenged and the learning opportunity that comes with challenge.  To them, effort is the means to achieve more.    The book then applies the above model in different areas: students in schools, leaders in corporate business, and interpersonal relationships.  The ingredients for encouraging children to grow to their full potential include: being fair, being non-judgmental, not using labels, showing goodwill, fostering trust, setting high standards, giving them ways and tools to achieve the high standards, and encouraging hard work.  The right way to praise a child is praising the effort, instead of praising his/her intelligence.    While I was reading this book, images of how I grew up appeared in my mind.  My culture always emphasizes hard work as the way of going through our education.  However, hard work was not necessarily the means for learning and understanding the material when I grew up. It was more the means for memorizing the material only.  Memorization does have its place in the whole course of education.  I wish my educational culture had also emphasized the appreciation, application, and true internalization of knowledge.     After I have read the book, I understand why some people have to prove themselves and compare themselves against others in whatever they do.  I could sense that they are very insecure inside. This book tells me that, they have to find every chance to prove themselves because they have the fixed mindset.They do not believe that their potential can be extended through effort and learning.  The true danger of having the fixed mindset is that, the world is ever-changing and new challenges never stop coming.  After a brief victory, it is very hard for a person with the fixed mindset to overcome setbacks.  On the other hand, a person with the growth mindset sees setbacks as the opportunities for learning and advancing.    This book is very useful in helping me understand how people succeed: through learning and effort.  It is an in-depth analysis of why people say, \\"Setbacks are merely signals that I need to keep learning.\\"
B00008BXJG|5.0|\\"Highway to Hell\\" is the final album AC/DC recorded with singer Bon Scott, it's the best record they made before his death . The opening title track is one of the group's signature hits, known for Young's brash guitars and Bon Scott's abrasive scream. It's a song of pure defiance and rebellion. Other noteworthy tracks are the fast-paced \\"Walk Over You,\\" the catchy \\"Touch Too Much\\" and \\"Shot Down in Flames.\\" This is the remastered and repackaged version, and as with virtually all of the Sony AC/DC reissues, there are no bonus tracks. However, there's a booklet containing some interesting color photos of the band, and it comes in a nice Digipak case. Diehard fans who already have prior versions of \\"Highway to Hell\\" should debate on their own whether to get the same album twice, but if you're new to AC/DC, this edition is the sure way to go.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I do like the workouts, I do like the trainer, but some of these moves are hard on the knees! The next day after working out, I had pain and stiffness in both knees, and I know Jillian is a big fan of \\"push yourself\\" so I didn't wimp out during the workout. I paid for it the next day. My knees have been bothering me ever since, about two weeks now. I have still been doing the workouts, but am careful during the portions where I feel my knees may be stressed too much. So take a warning if you have bad knees...this isn't for the weak kneed!!
B000F5GNX8|1.0|What can I say but everything you know is wrong.  How many paid shills are on this board raving about this boxoffice flop?  The reason Kiss Kiss Bang Bang flopped is because the movie stinks with a captiol S.  This is a movie that tries to be too snarky for its own good. Do yourself a big favor and don't buy this movie.  Do something better with you time like go help blind kids.  Anything is better than sitting through this unfunny film noir wannabe piece of drek.
B00164GDD2|1.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. But the Blu-Ray transfer is so shamefully bad I couldn't bear to watch more than a few minutes. It looks like they transferred an old theatrical print that sat for 20 years in a moldy apartment. The grain is HUGE and the image actually flickers from time to time. The original DVD transfer may be more compressed, but it's far more watchable than the Blu-Ray.  It's a pity SONY didn't try a little harder to release a quality product.
1603580557|5.0|\\"Thinking in Systems: A Primer\\" is a well-written and informative book on systems thinking.  Donella Meadows, the author, offers readers insight into specific ways of both viewing the world in a general sense, as well as viewing how the world's many systems work together...and against...each other.  This is a fantastic book.<br /><br />Donella Meadows clearly articulates *what* systems thinking \\"is\\" through her clear and eloquent writing style and judicious use of compelling real-world examples.  Moreover, Meadows makes a strong case, again through the use of real-world examples, of *why* systems thinking is important.<br /><br />The majority of this publication covers the *how* of systems thinking...put another way, it addresses the question of \\"how does one think in a 'systems thinking' manner?\\".  Meadows makes  good use of simple examples and easy-to-follow diagrams and charts to illustrate her points.<br /><br />This is an excellent book.  It lays out straightforward and compelling arguments for the benefits, and techniques, of systems thinking.  I highly recommend this publication.
B0028SVXR6|3.0|Octahedron may prove to be The Mars Volta's defining album.  Their punk latin-jazz electronica sound has been twisted and shaped into another new form, this time seeming to turn against the roaring, seething tide that built to a head with Amputechture and Bedlam In Goliath.  Where do you go when speed and chaos peak?  Octahedron is a focused, contemplative effort of reduction.    Generally I agree with the criticism that The Mars Volta tends to be musically self-indulgent, which can be seen as both positive and negative.  After the hype surrounding Bedlam in Goliath was finally over (the mind-numbing cliche of promotional bonus singles and collector's editions) and the album was available, I was disappointed by over an hour of jarring clashing instruments and high-pitched Mickey Mouse style vocals.  It was difficult enough to stand behind Amputechture, which took several weeks of listening before the chords, patterns and non-patterns could finally sink in.  On the other hand, this artistic self-gratification is an asset once you consider how unique and creative this band is during these dark times of American Idol winners, Katy Perry and Coldplay.    Where does Octahedron fit into all of this?  If The Mars Volta was headed down a wrong path with Goliath, will the switch to Warner records be a complete sell-out?  It isn't obvious yet, which is why I believe that this is a defining album: it seems apparent that the label is letting Omar and Cedric keep some creative control, but it also seems that they are also making an effort to reign in some of the chaos and over-indulgences.  Can The Mars Volta be more palatable to the mainstream, but still maintain their creative edge?  There is nothing inherently bad about slow, contemplative songs - who decided that The Mars Volta has to play fast?  There are enough interesting parts that prevent these from being rubber-stamped ballads, but the effects that are so enjoyable in Francis the Mute and Amputechture are hammered flathere.  The songs are very polished and listenable, but there are no real surprises either.  The latin-jazz sound that influences their earlier works is diluted.  \\"Teflon\\" is a catchy song, but it doesn't change very much and seems fitting for a video.  A steel guitar sound permeates the album in a way that reminds me of Pink Floyd's Meddle, especially on \\"With Twilight As My Guide\\" (which also sounds like a variation of \\"The Widow\\").  The Pink Floyd sound is also strong on \\"Luciforms\\" starting out with a slow-drip bass, very similar to Floyd's \\"Goodbye Cruel World,\\" then builds to a mature sounding jam: not the wild, all-out fusion of Amputechture and Bedlam in Goliath.  Also \\"Copernicus\\" finishes very nicely with stellar piano runs blending with guitar harmonics and bends on a milky synthesizer backdrop.     For me, this is The Mars Volta's first \\"commercial\\" album.  While this can be a musically dangerous spot for them in the long term especially with their fan-base, I like the change in direction from Bedlam.  They are standing at the crossroads, as many of The Greats have before them.

B000FBFMFW|4.0|if but a bit flawed with the main character in particular, Fitz or Fitzchivalry as he's called by a lot of folks throughout the story.  He's the illegitimate son of the late king Chivalry.  Which means he has a chance at becoming the next king in waiting.  But instead he's in the employ of the king-Shrewd.  Of course killing is a part of that along with getting critical info and other missions.  All of this while he's trying to win the heart of Molly.  Whom he befriended when a young child living with Burrich.<br /><br />She likes and he likes her but then she doesn't because of what he does and i'm sure other reasons.  But that's not really explained aside from the she doesn't want to be with him anymore.  There's other things going on as well with King in Waiting, Verity.  His evil and deceitful brother, Regal.  Whom hates Fitz or as he calls him the bastard and lets him know at every turn.<br /><br />Without giving away the whole storyline, the characters i've listed and others play a big part in this.  As their's deceit, betrayal, death, power struggles and all that.  It makes for a good second book in the series.  I would've liked to see Fitz be a bit more aggressive and forthright with things.  Instead of the inner turmoil and angst.  It tends to wear thin by the time this book is over.<br /><br />I enjoyed it for the most part even though i preferred the first book myself.  Royal Assassin is still a very solid read though.
B0026J8LHM|2.0|Before you judge me and my opinion, take into account the fact that I have bought every DT album and am a diehard fan, but let the unbiased truth be told...    Totally void of anything remotely memorable or creative, Dream Theater delivers their newest album like a morning log. Not even 2 full years after their previous release, Black Clouds and Silver Linings may be more rightfully titled, \\"Gotta put my kids through college, man\\".     The new album features 6 unneccessarily long songs that flow together seamlessly, but not in the way one might hope. Track after track will pass you by, making one wonder what song they are currently listening to, when the last one stopped... and more importantly, when will it end.     Dream Theater must be their own greatest fans as of late, as one song is merely random snippets of other songs on other albums. They are in essence, a cover band of themselves. It was cute and original the previous 16 times, but now they recycle their own **** like Waterworld. On a disc consisting of 10 or more songs, this may go over well, but DT really gives a big smack to face of all of their Trekky fans who adore them.    The lyrical content is typical of that of any random high school kid who aspires to be in a band but doesn't want to put the effort into actually learning an instrument;writing words on a notepad during studyhall. The vocal melodies are useless and ineffective.    The guitar is well played but still, something is missing. Petrucci and Co meander through the disc with no peaks or valleys on the record. Myung is nowhere to be heard, and Jordan's parts are limited and lifeless.     Dream Theater needs to allow the music to come to them in time, without time constraints and deadlines. They must find the drive that possessed them to become musicians in the first place, and not record another album until the spark ignites again. Holding the heavyweight title in the Progressive music genre, they must pass the torch on to inspired youngerartists who are currently making great records with little or no record label support.    F    This makes Octavarium seem like Pink Floyd's The Wall.
0375826726|5.0|I am sure that by now I am well known as the foremost reviewer of the Inheritance Cycle books (well, actually person is well known as that but they won't allow him to post reviews anymore so I am posting them for him). And, though I spoke exceptionally highly of Mr. Paolini's first two novels, I feel that this novel binds the other two together in a way which I had not expected and find extremely profound. Such is the fine craftsmanship and hard work that went into this novel that I believe it should be used as a reference point for all trilogies to come. This novel, embodying the true spirit of adventure and greatness, sports a gold dragon. But not just a gold dragon, a strikingly beautiful gold dragon with funny glossy eyes and a beard that's kind of twisty. But the truly remarkable thing about this novel is not merely the cover art but the way in which the cover art works harmoniously with the other two books. The first book had a blue dragon, the second had a red dragon, and now, the third, Brisinger, has a gold dragon! The colors of the dragons are exactly the same as the colors of the different shirts worn in Star Trek! Blue for science, Red for engineering, and gold for command! The subtlety and impact of this unity within the series is brilliant and astonishing! Mr. Paolini has boldly gone where no man has gone before in his intentional effort to make his books reflect the colors of Star Trek. And he has pulled it off with flying colors (pun not intended).<br /><br />This trilogy will undoubtedly stand as the most unified and well crafted trilogy ever written and will be the benchmark on which all other trilogies are judged. Mr. Paolini, you have earned your crown in heaven, and William Shatner will greet thee with open arms.
B00204AA0O|2.0|terrible follow up to a great album.  Begin to Hope is one of my favorite albums, it has an upbeat, uplifting beat and lyrics.  It is fun, intelligent and innovative in its creativity.  Far is not Begin to Hope. It is Far from Begin to Hope.  It is a depressing, melancholy  album that seems written in a hurry, which is strange since it has been so long since Begin to Hope. I had high hopes and was looking forward to this album, but I was severely let down.  I think Regina spector is a very talented artist, but this was a complete disappointment.  She can and has done better.  Her style is not depressing songs without hope.  I hope she quickly goes back to what she does best and gives us a treat like before.  Until then, I can not recommend this album, it was sad and not in a musically enjoyable way.
0740748475|5.0|I rate \\"Calvin and Hobbes\\" among the best comic strips ever written.  Having the complete collection in hardback format is a must for a real comic fan.  The printing is good both for black and white and colour strips.  Every strip has its publication date.  In the long term, the books can present some problems, because the pages are glued to the back, but a careful use of them can prevent long-term wear and tear.
B000001EL3|5.0|Always considered to be their best.while i always liked ROCK AND ROLL OVER best,this is their most sucsessful to date.Opening with Detroit Rock City (generally regarded as the band's best ever tune) it sets the tone with its banrstorming stlye before leading into King of the Nightime World and God of Thunder. Then it takes a turn with the bizarre Great Expectations (cruelly ignored by the band for almost 20 years on stage) and Flamin' Youth. Sweet Pain is also a decent song but it is over the last three songs that the album picks up again. Shout it out Loud is classic arena rock. The heart pounding, adrenlin flowing, meat and potatoes anthemic metal was to become a KISS classics on stage for the next two decades. Then another twist with the softer ballard Beth. This was the song that got KISS noticed and although many fans never forgave the band for losing the rock edge, it stands out as a must listen of their extensive and impressive catalogue. The album then fades into Do you Love Me, superbly produced and sung although often over played down the years it is none the less a fitting way to end the album.
7885880737|5.0|thank you for being able to supply me with movies that i never thought would possible to find.
B00005JLWN|3.0|This movie will remind you of a lot of movies but only in part and that's the problem with this movie.  It tries to do too much while not giving us enough of a background to understand or care about what is happening.  The main character is a 'cleric' but that's never truly explained.  The whole society seems to produce nothing so how does it survive?      In any society, if you continually gave drugs to people to suppress their emotions, it would destroy the ability to produce REM sleep.  Such suppression has been show to be a precursor to sleep deprivation and the inability to sleep (i.e. insomnia).  REM sleep is when we dream and it is thought to be necessary for consolidating memory and releasing tension.  The loss of REM could lead to a society of insomniacs.  Since no drug is perfect a number of people would become immune to it while others would have allergic reactions that could lead to death.    The 'shooting' scenes are right out of the MATRIX trilogy, the burning of the pictures,books,etc. are right out of Fahrenheit 451, and so many other scenes are out of 1984 (especially the man speaking from a screen to people in rooms and on the street).  The movie just seems to telegraph what's going to happen in the next section over and over.  The man at the top (who is supposed to report to 'Father') seems to be emotionally unstable which makes us wonder if he take his drugs.      To formulaic and to much taken from other movies that did it better.    Zeb Kantrowitz
B001GCUO16|1.0|Love the movie and blu-ray is fun but but it sucks when it says it includes a digital copy that is iTunes and Mac compatible but it won't play in my iTunes on my iMac. So far I've had that with all 3 of the other X-Men series but all other (non rights managed) movies seem to play fine. They load in fine after the code key but then play 2 hours worth of grey screen with no sound. It's too bad, makes paying for a digital copy pointless. If you have iTunes and want a digital copy - you're better off with piracy! At least then, you're sure they'll play!! No way I'm buying anything else with a \\"digital copy\\" included until they get this fixed (yes, I've tried both contacting Apple (who tried to figure it out at least) and the studios (who just don't care as it doesn't affect everyone, yet).

B0013FXWU6|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis is very impressive in this film...and, for the most part, very handsome...even with oil on his face.  So, for my money, it's worth watching....once.  The script is based on a story by Upton Sinclair which was relevant and important at the time Sinclair wrote it.  Now...not so much.  I think the film could have been better if the main character, Daniel Plainview, had been given more to do than cheat and rob people.  True, the interaction with his son is interesting and that saves the film.  Also, the little bit with the blond girl, Mary, was interesting and, at that point, he seemed to be a caring man who was protecting the girl from beatings by her father.     What I didn't understand from the film was how deeply he degenerated after he the son returned to him.  It seemed that things were going well for him--he had the family that he had always longed for and certainly the material success.  So why, in the last segment, in his huge mansion, was he so severely embittered?  There was nothing to explain the schism between him and his son. The final scene bordered on the bizarre...did Sinclair write that?     While I'm complaining, I'll add that I've about had enough of the character of the charlatan minister.  Perhaps they abounded at the time of Sinclair, but I think this stereotype has been exploited enough.  I've met many wonderful men who were ministers, even of the holy roller type, and I personally find it offensive that they are so often portrayed in this way. This fellow, Eli, was alternately wimpy, cruel, craven and hysterical, not to mention that he was bad looking and had a terrible haircut. I never did understand what happened to Paul. (Only Robert DuVall, in The Apostle, showed the positive side of these men.)      Visually the film gives you plenty to look at.  The oil well fire is spectacular.  Even though it's long, it did hold my interest, mostly because of Lewis' performance.  He is such a spectacular looking man and has such a greatvoice that he engages our sympathy way beyond what was realistic for such a character.    I was heartened to read so many negative reviews...am happy to see that not everyone is impressed by the hype this film got.  I give it three stars for the overall spectacle and the Lewis' performance.
0783228007|5.0|After all of the negative reviews, I wasn't expecting much so I was very surprised how much I liked this movie.  I found this far more interesting and compelling than most of Eastwood's westerns.  Robert Duvall played a great villain and the story and scenery were top notch.
B0026NWBY2|2.0|Clear as crystal is George Harrison's problem - the Beatles split up; stranding him in that undesirable limbo cruelly but accidentally moulded for musicians who for many years fall between two stools - high acclaim and undreamt of wealth off the back of two far more prominent artists, and personal creative frustration for the same reasons.<br /><br />Harrison got the scraps from Lennon and McCartney's table - and it has to be said - understandably.<br />They'd throw him a bone occasionally, pat him on the head, and allow him a cameo; the results of which - more often than not - were dire. I'm thinking in particular of that awful Velvet Underground-with-sitars drear fest: 'Within You, Without You' - for John and Paul it was welcome respite from the hating.<br /><br />So it's not really surprising that his solo work exhibit's the same failings magnified. The VU name-check is appropriate: take away Reed and Cale and what would you have?<br />Likewise, Harrison was too full of his own beans, caught up in his own (in his eyes) underestimated part of that hysterical Fab Four myth; straining to be let loose but ultimately not having the sand or natural born to back it up.<br /><br />Admittedly, 'Let it Roll' could've been better selected, but the arbitrary, obliging quality of what is presented, quietly but firmly defines the concept of solo Harrison as the mediocrity it really is.<br />It's the most irritating kind of music: neither toe-curlingly awful (except for the dreadful 'Got My Mind Set On You') nor momentous and up-lifting.<br /><br />It's a music that offers little, but expects plenty in return. It's so middle-aged, passive and harmless - and therefore far, far away from the real spirit of rock 'n' roll - that you hardly remember listening to it. It kind of floats away on a breeze of timidity, helplessly envious of storms elsewhere.<br />A couple of songs pass: 'My Sweet Lord' is just about ok, 'Give Me Love' is worth a foot-tap but genuine moments here are few and far between.<br /><br />I still think he's better than McCartney, who I loathe with a savagery that frightens me, and he's never getting near Lennon; but surely even the most blinkered, buy-everything Beatles devotee won't be hoodwinked by 'Let It Roll' and will sensibly treat it to the wide-berth it deserves.than McCartney, who I loathe with a savagery that frightens me, and he's never getting near Lennon; but surely even the most blinkered, buy-everything Beatles devotee won't be hoodwinked by 'Let It Roll' and will sensibly treat it to the wide-berth it deserves.

0385737424|5.0|As Miranda and her friends navigated the Upper West Side, I kept expecting them to run into characters from Judy Blume's \\"Fudge\\" series. The landscape -- New York in the 1970s -- is the same, and Miranda's issues with friends and family are much like those you'd encounter in a Judy Blume book. What's different is that Miranda starts getting mysterious notes -- notes that predict her future in a way that should be impossible. Cue the \\"Twilight Zone\\" music here.<br /><br />This is a great read -- I sat down with it the afternoon it arrived and pretty much didn't get up until I finished it. Rebecca Stead is, IMO, a much more graceful writer than Judy Blume. In addition to friends and family issues, \\"When You Reach Me\\" addresses class and race in a thoughtful, subtle way. Plus, messages that might be from the future. As my spouse sometimes says, what could be bad? I really loved this book.

Man, it seems that some people don't like DT's most recent albums only because they aren't as good as Images And Words... Wake up, it's IMPOSSIBLE to make an album better than Images And Words! Anyway, enough whinning... In The Presence Of Enemies alone makes the album deserve 5 stars! It's easily one of their best songs! It's very epic, it's full of amazing melodies, it's full of great riffs and it has many very catchy parts! The other songs are nowhere near as good, but none of them is weak. Forsaken is a good accessible catchy song, Constant Motion has many great riffs, The Dark Eternal Night has some very heavy riffs and a pretty damn catchy chorus, Repentant and The Ministry Of Lost Souls are nice ballads and Prophets Of War is very catchy and I love the keyboard in it! All in all, this album really doesn't deserve all of the hate that it gets. It seems that some DT fans are never satisfied. Everything is never enough.    4.5/5 because I have to admit that Forsaken, Constant Motion and The Dark Eternal Night are pretty average for Dream Theater songs. They're very good. The problem is that they're nowhere near as good as the rest.
B000VYXJBM|5.0|I read the Narnia books for the first time when I was about 12/13 yrs old.  I loved them!  Couldn't put them down.  After the first Narnia movie came out, I decided to buy them all hardbound to re-read and keep for the kids.  They still read great.  Even if you aren't a Christian, I wasn't when I read them the first time, the stories are a wonderful picture of fantasy intermingled with a light morality play.  If you are a Christian, you'll also love the symbolism behind Aslan (Jesus) and the White Witch (Satan).  If you are 10 or 110, you'll love these books and could read them over and over and over again.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|I love, love, LOVE the MUSIC on this CD.  ***The problem with THE NEW MUSIC INDUSTRY is that in order to compete VOLUME WISE, it is necessary(?) to use audio compression to be as loud as all the other tracks on the airwaves or you no longer fit in.  NO MORE SUBTLETIES.....This is the first Pumpkins album I have heard like this......Lots of complaints about the new METALLICA as well.  @@  It gives the music a midrange canned tone but ....IT'S LOUD!!    BUT, CAN'T WE JUST TURN UP OUR STEREOS?  This process compresses the LOWS or quiet sounds all the way up to withing 80-90% of the loud ones so any DYNAMICS that were involved in the original recording are GONE.  Hopefully in the future they will begin to offer compressed or uncompressed.  Todd the Sound Engineer.

When I first purchased the movie, I was hoping that my expectations would be met about this movie since the first Hulk was trash, but I watched it, and it was hot. I'm really glad that I  bought it.

0061537969|5.0|There are so many reviews on this book, it almost seems I don't need to write one, but I loved it so much, I wanted to write my own review anyway.  I am a cat person and I hate car racing, but my sister introduced me to this book, showing me all the consistent high reviews, so I had to check it out. I am so glad I did. It is such an amazing book, when I found myself crying in the first chapter, I knew I was in for a good read!  The dog, telling the story, is more of a human then many people I have met, and I love that the author chose to tell a story through his eyes. It is a book that is one I will read over again. After racing through it the first time, wanting to see where life was leading this family, I feel like I should read it again, and savor the wonderful writing by Mr. Stein. Great book, great story, beautiful words.
1595478728|5.0|This book, which Chesterton, an English journalist, novelist and all around early twentieth century public intellectual, is described by him as a \\"slovenly autobiography.\\" While he engages much with competing views of the world prominent in Western culture of his time (and still ours), he is not writing apologetics per se though he is arguing for the truth of Christianity. Religion, like politics, is something deeply personal and intuitive. I enjoy rational argument, but I also enjoy his deeply personal touch which keeps it real.<br /><br />Chesterton is more of a mystic than a rationalist. He observes that insanity is often induced from seeing too much causality in everything. A determinist, who sees only material causation has a worldview that doesn't really encompass our world. It can give the impression of explaining everything, but on second thought it also seems to miss everything. A man who thinks that only material causes exist is like the man who believes that everyone is conspiring against him. The facts gathered from the senses are interpreted to support this narrow conclusion. Every one who glances at him is secretly plotting his demise, everyone who accidentally touches him are planting tracking devices, etc. While both the determinist and this insane man both have explanations that coherently explain everything around them, both also leave out so much. Such minds need to see more possibilities, to have the windows and fans in their minds opened and turned on. They need fresh air.<br /><br />After this rejection of materialism/determinism, Chesterton moves to the reasons why he gravitated towards Christianity. He states that he made these observations before he even considered Christian theology. It is fascinating that he connects Christianity with democracy and practical politics so extensively. The Christian's respect for tradition is very democratic at heart because it extends the principle that we should listen to all people no matter where they are in life by accident of birth, to the notion that we should listen to all people despite the accident of death. \\"It is the democracy of the dead,\\" Chesterton said. The unpopular doctrine of original is also democratic at heart. Evil is not caused primarily by men's environment, nor is it an illusion or hopelessly triumphant. Evil is in the heart of humanity, something that is in each one of us. The one who sees a good God in heaven is philosophically free to turn and see a bad president in Washington. In contrast, most other philosophies are either unconsciously or explicitly complacent in the fact of oppression. It is difficult to justify a rebellion if you are a monist Hindu living out the life of an `untouchable' due to sins you've committed in previous lives. The giant monuments to the ancient states of Egypt and Babylon show us that when these various deeply pessimistic philosophies and religions are dominant, state power over the individual becomes absolute.<br /><br />Another flaw of materialism is that it rests on a false assumption. If the universe was really personal wouldn't we see more variation in terms of biological laws and physical laws? Isn't that more theistic? Reminding me of Hume, Chesterton notes that really these observations are probabilistic, there is nothing really law-like about them. Three and two must always make five but it is not the same with the color of grass or the rising of the sun. We know that monotony is something that only the young can truly enjoy. The child often says: \\"Do it again,\\" to the adult. Maybe because we have sinned and grown old, our Father is younger than we are. Maybe he says to the sun: \\"Do it again,\\" every morning. Chesterton is wise to point out all of this and more.<br /><br />This book is a gold mine of wisdom and insight that hits home much more than any apologetic text ever has for me. Like Chesterton, I believe in Christianity on the basis of evidence, though I also agree with him that all of life can bementioned as evidence. As C.S. Lewis said, \\"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.\\" Christianity is an answer to a riddle. Like every answer though, one has to first discover what the riddle is. Just as in our day, far too many have forgotten the riddle. In short, this riddle is, how are we to live in a sinful world?<br /><br />Chesterton's answer to this won't convince everyone but to those who see the same things in the world as he does and wants the same things in his heart, will agree with him or at least empathize with him. To give a full description and defense of his answer would take too long and be a complete rehashing of this entire book which is beyond the scope of this review. In closing, I will affirm though that Chesterton's answer is also my answer.Lewis said, \\"I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.\\" Christianity is an answer to a riddle.

0307266303|5.0|Born to Run was an incredibly enjoyable read.  You felt the passion and joy McDougall and the rest of the characters have for running and for life in general.  He did a great job telling the story of the Tarahumara, as well as describing the characters of the American runners from the race.  The story was also helped by intertwining a few things: Ultra History 101, barefoot running, and the evolution of humans as distance runners.    Great story for the narrative, very informative as a history, and a read as fast as the Tarahumara themselves.

B000RZIGUY|4.0|This NOT the greatest Joh woo film that he has ever made; at least as a director for an American production film/Company.  There are some fun action scenes and cool explosive shoot-outs, but the plot lacks slightly.  The idea of J. Travolta being changed to a \\"mad-man\\" (aka. Nicholas Cage), but that is the most interesting portion of the whole movie.  The rest of the movie is only good during the action scenes, NOT during the dialogue of the other scenes.  If you really want to watch a GREAT John Woo movie watch: BROKEN ARROW  -or-  PAYCHECK  -or-  his hong kong flicks, with Chow-Yun Fat.

B000066744|5.0|Since most of what needs to be said about this fine movie has already been said, I'll just give one example of why some professional critics who panned it just don't get it, not only in their dismissals of it as treacle in general (hey, we're too fashionably jaded for this!), but in the details.    From Stephen Holden's review in the NY Times--    \\"In the film's dramatic climax, Jelly Roll Morton (Clarence Williams 3d), who has heard rumors of Nineteen Hundred's genius, books a passage on the Virginian specifically to challenge him to a piano duel. But the piece (composed by Ennio Morricone) with which Nineteen Hundred defeats Morton is a whirling, twirling, fussy, ''Flight of the Bumblebee''-like finger-flying exhibition that has velocity but little coherence. It is no match artistically for Morton's propulsive meat-and-potatoes jazz.\\"     Yep, Jelly Roll Morton was one of the greatest pianists of all time (and by all accounts just as much of a colossal jerk as portrayed in the film), though I doubt he would've been pleased by Holden's description of his music as \\"meat-and-potatoes jazz.\\"     But Holden has no clue about what audiences expect, even demand, in such musical competitions-- head cutting contests, in jazz and blues jargon. They want exactly what 1900 gives them, a display of technique for the sake of technique. Artistry? Give me a break.    Ennio Morricone gets this. 1900 gets it. And you can bet Jelly Roll Morton himself, the real one, got it. Stephen Holden doesn't. He's the kind of guy who is overawed by the glories of REAL JAZZ.    You want to win a head cutting contest? How many notes can you play in one minute? How cleanly can you play them? Audiences eat this stuff up. 1900 understands this. He doesn't want to cut heads with Morton at all, and tries to avoid it until Morton ups the ante beyond recall.     \\"And eff jazz, too!\\"

B001E75QGG|4.0|\\"KCS\\" was not anywhere nearly as bad as I'd been lead to believe. But I understand why so many fans were disappointed.<br /><br />As others have said, it's not fair to condemn Indy's \\"refrigerator escape\\" without also criticizing all the other silly gags in the films (they are, after all, supposed to be tongue-in-cheek homages/parodies), most notably the \\"life-raft escape\\" in #2. Indy, Willie, and Short Round /should/ have been killed (or at least had their hips rammed into their jaws), * but it /looked/ plausible. Sort of. The \\"refrigerator escape\\" so obviously crossed the line of plausibility that audiences rejected it. (I have no problems with CGI prairie dogs, however.)<br /><br />\\"KCS\\"'s main problem is that, unlike the other films, there is no specific item -- the Ark, the stones, the Grail -- to drive and motivate the plot. Instead, he and the others are headed someone to find something that might be of interest. We've already seen the powers of the Crystal Skull, so why should we remain interested? And we're told so much about what to expect that the climax isn't much of a payoff. (And it isn't very exciting, either.) The result is an adventure film lacking the tension such films need. The whole thing has a set-piece \\"concocted\\" quality.<br /><br />The Blu-ray Disk comes in a nice little hard-back book with production photos. It's not a big deal, but it's nice to see this sort of deluxe packaging, which other companies seem to be adopting. (Maybe they're trying to maintain the price of BDs.)<br /><br />Now, how about the first three disks in good BD editions?<br /><br />* I recently met a retired Army man whose chute failed to open -- and whose legs were so badly injured he's now 3\\" shorter than he used to be.

I bought the two pack one and two movie set with the book included and enjoyed every minute of this 1984 classic sci-fi-comedy film. Dan akroyd and Bill Murray could not be topped. The former SNL legends made this movie with their slap stick and perfect timing. The CGI ghouls were awesome the second time arounjd. This flick stood the test of time and gave me a great time....<br />The two movie pack w/ movie book is a nice addition to my collection.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|Loved this goofy take on a Jane Austen hit. The more you love Austen, the more you will like this movie.     The main character, Amanda's behavior was shocking and awkward in a Regency England setting (like wearing the wrong clothes, swearing outloud, and predicting the future), but the staple Pride and Prejudice characters react right in character. They actually behave more like themselves than the original characters, if that's possible. At first Amanda's outbursts were startling, but after a while I enjoyed them. She said what any modern reader would say outloud as she read her favorite book.     Because I am an Austen fan, the twisting of the Pride and Prejudice love stories made me queasy and worried for the final outcome of my favorite characters. Would Darcy and Elizabeth still be able to fall in love? I kept wanting Amanda to go back to modern life and leave my characters alone, but yet, I couldn't stop watching. The plot got more and more windy and confused and I worried there would be no possible way to end it without a \\"and then she woke up and it was all a dream.\\" And then the plot twisted some more and some more before it finally worked out. I couldn't believe some of the risks the author took, but they worked!
B000UG78NG|5.0|One of the only reasons I read this book is because I had just finished reading Robin Hobb's (love her!!!) books and she had favorably reviewed this book.     One reason I love reading fantasy novels is because the writers have to be so much more aware of their art in order to really pull the reader in. Patrick did a phenomenal job of gripping the readers attention from the first page by rendering a simple concept into complexity. This is a common theme throughout the book.    His magic is very believable, and interesting. I found the storyline, his writing style, and the plot very fresh. It did take me a few chapters to really get invested, but by the time I was--I didn't stop until I had finished.     I highly recommend this book.
B00006G8HX|5.0|Everyone should watch Star Trek II and then immediately put this in. It becomes very satisfying. I felt very content with the script and the believability of the story, though some may knock it. To me, this is the best of the films. I felt like watching it, I was being sucked into the character's world and paying attention to their needs. I guess that is what a great film does. I think people don't give Nimoy the credit he deserved for this movie. I mean seriously, looking back on it who else could have done it? I used to think that II was better film, but now that I am older I really appreciate this movie. I personally think it carries all of the momentum from the The Wrath of Khan over. People who give this movie a bad review, should watch II and then immediately watch this.

B0026J8LHM|5.0|\\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\" is the latest offering from Dream Theater, and it is a bit darker than it's predecessor \\"Systematic Chaos\\".  That's because it's somewhat of an autobiographic album, about some hard times that the band members have endured.  \\"A Nightmare to Remember\\" is about a car accident that John Petruci went through.  If you listen to it with that in mind, the song really has much more drama, you realize that this is a personal account of a dark moment in his life.  Also, \\"The Best of Times\\" is Mike Portnoy's loving tribute to his father, who recently passed away.  Death of a loved one is always very difficult for those who have to carry on.      Dream Theater has always been a positive band though, the outlook on the world that the members have is a good one.  Just listen to \\"The Shattered Fortress\\"....\\"I am responsible, when anyone, anywhere reaches out for help, I want my hand to be there\\"    The best track on the album by far is \\"The Count of Tuscany\\", very progressive, with a solo from Petrucci that really is awesome.    One thing to note as well, the album starts off to the sound of a thunderstorm, ie. the storms of life, and ends with the sound of birds singing, evoking a scene of peace.  After all, the album is titled \\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\".    It took a couple of days to feel this album out, but I'm glad I took my time with this one. It's a solid album from Dream Theater and definitely worthy of your time and money.  5 stars.
1576754227|2.0|Short book on how to succeed by learning to prioritize, plan, and execute. Good advice in the beginning, but lots of contradictory pieces later on destroy book's credibility. A bit repetitive, no great motivational writing though. A list price of US $15.95 is steep for a book this short - 21 chapters of a thousand words (or so) each.<br /><br />Some of the content is repetitive, worded differently, yet trying to drive the same point. This is not the definitive book to read on procrastination, and while there is good advice, especially in the first half of the book, the latter half contains some egregious contradictions that are very difficult to ignore and seriously undermine the credibility of the entire book. If at the end of the book you get the feeling that this book is only a pitch for author's personal coaching programs, you are not alone.<br /><br />Then there are aphorisms that you may find difficult to accept at face value. Like \\"leap and the net will appear\\". Yes, you know that the author really means to say that you should have faith and confidence, and then take the action, but if your mind starts thinking, \\"yeah right! That could be one short leap into oblivion\\" or something similar it sort of destroys the aura of hope and motivation that the book is hoping to create.<br /><br />Or \\"listen to audio programs in your car\\". Why?? Isn't that going to distract you from the task at hand - driving? Driver distraction is perhaps the leading cause of road accidents, and here the author is telling the reader to add one more distraction to their driving routine?!! Listening to an audio recording of a course is also a very passive exercise - the efficacy of such audio programs in actually teaching anything of lasting value is doubtful. Of course, such audio programs have worked very well for the makers of such programs, thank you, but learning has to be interactive to be effective - not unidirectional, passive, and requiring no more than a vegetative state of mind at best.<br /><br />Some of the advice is contradictory - and while the reasonable person will realize that the advice is contextual, and one of many strategies for getting useful work done, it is still disconcerting to read in one chapter (Ch 18, \\"Slice and Dice The Task\\"):<br /><br />_____Another technique you can use to get yourself going is called the \\"Swiss cheese\\" method of working. You use this technique to get yourself into gear by resolving to punch a hole in the task, like a hole in a block of Swiss cheese.<br />_____This may be as little as five or ten minutes, after which you will stop and do something else. You will just take one bite of your frog and then rest or do something else.<br /><br />and in the very next chapter (\\"Create Large Chunks of Time\\") the author states:<br /><br />_____Most of the really important work you do requires large chunks of unbroken time to complete. Your ability to carve out and use these blocks of high-value, highly productive time is central to your ability to make a significant contribution to your work and to your life.<br />_____Set aside thirty-, sixty- and ninety-minute time segments that you use to work on and complete important tasks.<br /><br />and further on in the book (Ch 21 - \\"Single Handle Every Task\\"):<br /><br />_____It has been estimated that the tendency to start and stop a task--to pick it up, put it down, and come back to it--can increase the time necessary to complete the task by as much as 500 percent.<br /><br />Sir, Mr Tracy, dude - just what exactly do you want the now totally confused reader to do??? Swiss cheese, large chunks, single-handle - what???<br /><br />The book cites Learned [[ASIN:1400078393 Learned Optimism: How to Change Your Mind and Your Life]] - that seems to be interesting enough and well reviewed that it may be a good idea to go read **that** book instead.<br /><br />Other excerpts from the book:<br />-----------------------------<br />_____\\"Just find out what other successful people do and do the same things until you get the same results.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie; it may have even topped the 1989 Batman movie in my mind. I liked the pacing of the movie, especially in the second half. The action then just won't let up. There are some overly talky moments, but even that is important for plot exposition. This one doesn't end with Batman the hero, on top of the world. Batman is a hunted fugitive, which is how I think it really should be. No police force in the world would accept a vigilante the way Gotham PD does in the beginning of the movie.<br />Heath Ledger did a great job here, and I don't feel he stole the show like Jack Nicholson did. The scene with him in the hospital with Two-Face was so funny, and also afterward when he blows up the hospital. How ironic that they let the Joker live to the end of this movie, then the actor that played him passed away.<br />I did kind of miss the gothic Tim Burton sets that we have grown used to seeing, but it was interesting seeing Batman operate in a modern skyscraper jungle. As for his gadgets, the tumbler/cycle thing was cool, but his cell phone seeing-through-walls vision thing that Fox (Morgan Freeman) quit over was \\"give me a break\\" in my opinion. So, at the end of this movie, Batman has lost all his toys, his most trusted associate, and is wanted (for real) by the cops. I think it sets up many very interesting possibilities if they ever do another sequel. And he still has to finish rebuilding Stately Wayne Manor!

B001YV504U|4.0|This is a wonderful story and a great movie. I own one of the first versions of the DVD. I was always hoping there would be a version with a better surround soundtrack. The Field of Dreams Blu-ray edition's audio is actually better, but only marginally so. The video is really good, too. Some of the darker scenes on DVD had some noticeable artifacts. In the Blu-ray edition, they seem to be gone. There are plenty of extras, but I don't have a lot of time to enjoy them so I won't review them here.<br /><br />I'd recommend this Blu-ray edition only to this movie's enthusiasts or folks who have a Blu-ray play and not the DVD edition of this movie.
B001TODCII|3.0|This movie seems to follow a pattern of action movies in recent years...dark, gloomy, serious. What happened to movies like the James Bond movies with Roger Moore? They were ENTERTAINING. The Bourne movies...another example. They're great action flicks, but kind of one-dimensional. Everybody's serious, dark...ready to either kill somebody else or their own self at any moment. \\"Taken\\" is like that.    OK, I can understand the constant seriousness if the movie is portrayed to be generally realistic. After all, there is nothing humorous or entertaining about a teenage daughter being kidnapped. However, this movie is definitely NOT realistic, almost to the point of being laughable. I wish I had a dollar for every bullet that missed Mills (Neeson's character) that was pointed straight at him. And I'm trying to decide which was more unrealistic...Mills' ability to dodge bullets or the stupidity of his ex-wife and his daughter's friend. Total airheads! (Well, on second thought I guess there are people that stupid out there.) The movie, while definitely action-packed and exciting in many places, just seemed to move too fast (not surprisingly, it's only 90 minutes).    Anyway, this flick is great for a QUICK action movie, but just not \\"well rounded\\" enough for me.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|Paul Newman really knew what to do in almost every film that he was in. In \\"Cool Hand Luke,\\" he is almost flawless as Luke. Here, Luke becomes a part of the Chain Gang, but he is not your typical member. He refuses to be a part of this whole establishment that would force him to submit and surrender. Not only is Newman spectacular here, but the rest of the cast pull it off nicely. George Kennedy gives an unforgettable performance as Dragline, who slowly supports Luke during the film. Strother Martin is compelling, even humorous, as the Captain. He is the one who says \\"What we have here is . . . failure to communicate.\\" That quote has become one of the most memorable of all time, and has been referenced and parodied in many films and TV shows. Jo Van Fleet as Luke's mother is something to look forward to: she sees what her son has become, but still knows that she has done the best for him. And finally, a young Dennis Hopper as Babalugats is minor, but it's a treat for those who admire the actor.<br /><br />Grade: A

I can easily figure out the obvious C# --> Java \\"translation\\" on my own! But I was really looking for a book that was written at a level that would teach me useful differences quickly. This book is worth gold!
B000GRUS22|5.0|I'm going to tell you up front -- I'm a big fan of Enigma.  Have been since \\"MXMXC a.D.\\" and have all their albums.  To me, even repetitive Enigma -- like \\"Goodbye Milky Way\\" -- is better than most other musicians' work.  I especially like \\"Dreaming of Andromeda\\" on this disk.  And, as usual, their mix and song sequence is impeccable.<br /><br />My one complaint is their albums are too short.  I could easily live with them being twice as long...but then again, that might defeat the beauty of them.<br /><br />But like I said -- I'm already a huge fan.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Now that I have seen the whole of this mini serie, I'm still more impressed that the first time I wrote an opinion for this dvd.      I bought this product on Amazon.com, because when I learned the existence of this mini-serie by watching the Emmy Awards on a French channel, the subject seemed interesting for me, but there was no way at this time to see it in France : John Adams is an American President fully unknown in our country, and it wouldn't be commercial to air it or to release such a dvd in stores. Now in March 2011, we begin to see it on small cable channels TV and two or three copies in retail stores.      As for foreigners, it doen't present problem : the serie is subtitled (at least in French) and so is the first extra (but not the making of). Each episode is very long to see ; the average length is more than 1 hour, and you have to see it twice to read the English subtitles giving the historical context of what is narrated.    According to my opinion, the performance of Paul Giamatti and other actors is quite remarkable. The box set is very beautiful with its golden yellow.    I spoke about this serie with a French friend of mine working in the US who saw it on American TV : he was astonished that during this second US Administration, there was a war between France and the US. Almost nobody in France knows something about this war. I told him that according my poor knowledge, two wars confronted France and the US : the one of 1797-1798, and one on the 8th of November 1942 in Casablanca, Morocco. On both cases, the French army was defeated by the US. I told him also that it was during John Adam's administration, and because of this war, that the US Navy and the Marine Corps were created and are still existing today.     My friend concluded that he had to read an history of the United States to have a better knowledge of the country where he is working now !    For the same reasons, I encourage more French people to buy this miniserie DVD. Obviously youhave to be interested in history. But first it's an enthusiastic performance,specially the one of Paul Giamatti and also of the actress performing the character of Abigail, and second they will learn historical facts not taught in French schools.   Frankly speaking, we don't see much of the first US-French war, but on the opposite we can see Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Adams in Versailles. and if this mini serie was composed only of this part, it would be enough to say that it's far superior to Sofia Copplola's movie about Marie-Antoinette, queen of France.    But apart of this, I learnt a lot of interesting items such as the way the Declaration of Independance was signed, how they treated smallpox or breast cancer in the 18th century. And more surprising than anything else, how a Chief Executive of the USA could walk alone in infamous parts of Philadelphia to meet his son.    Who could imagine such things for a US President today ?    Conclusion : buy it and you will have enriched your knowledge for quite a reasonable price !
B0000263JN|5.0|Dynamic cultural scenes stimulate brilliant, serious playfulness--Dada and surrealism in '20s Europe, American jazz (Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Fats Waller) in the '20s and '30s, Bob Dylan in the American '60s...and, in the British late '60s, the Incredible String Band. OK, maybe they're not quite playing in those folks' league, but the keen pleasures of their inventiveness and, yes, whimsy keep this music fresh. This and \\"The 10000 Layers of the Onion\\" are wonderful records.

B0013LL2Z2|2.0|The world of dystopian sci-fi movies contains several peaks and valleys.  Some peaks: \\"Planet of the Apes\\" (the version with Charlton Heston, not the remake), \\"The Time Machine\\" (the George Pal version, not the remake), \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Brazil,\\" and perhaps a few others (I have a nostalgic fondness for \\"Silent Running,\\" for instance).  The valleys are far too numerous to mention, but one of the classic examples is \\"Logan's Run.\\"  Watching it in the theater, at the age of 11, I remember thinking: \\"What a dopey movie!\\"  It hasn't aged well in the interim.  The most compelling dystopian sci-fi is that which bears at least a little possibility of becoming a reality someday (\\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" for example, is probably already a reality); \\"Logan's Run\\" is so far \\"out there\\" that it's impossible to take seriously.  As an expression of baby-boomer paranoia, it ranks right up there with Viagra commercials.  Still dopey after all these years...

But you do not have 3 versions (On mine anyway) Subtitle is in Spanish only. No French etc...  I love that DVD but it's not the ultimate edition. I do not know where to find the ultimate edition and I do not know if it has a metal sleeve.  If somebody knows, please let me know how can I recignize the ultimate and where to find it  Guy

B000VLOKQI|5.0|Unique fascinating look at the creative process and aesthetic of all four members of the band, albeit two now deceased.  Townsend and Daltry remain giants of rock music...and have a special story to tell about the singer-songwriter partnership and their \\"amazing journey\\" as musicians and artists.  Like others of the century, Dylan, Paul Simon, Springsteen, Paul McCartney, etc., and the Energiser Bunny, they keep going, and going, and going.  Check out the more recent Real Good Looking Boy...just a fabulous song...rivals anything from the 70s.  The acoustic version is just as good as the group recording.  If you're a Who fan, it's a mesmerizing DVD...watched it three times, and saw something new each time.  [Not intended to be a complete musical compilation of 40 years.]
B00204AA0O|4.0|You would think if you went into the studio with as diverse producers as Jeff Lynne (ELO), David Kahne (Tony Bennett), Jacknife Lee (Snow Patrol), and Mike Elizondo (Eminem) you would come out with an eclectic groups of tracks. Yet for the third album by Regina Spektor with those for four producers all contributing, Far still sounds like classic Spektor with only those with the highest musical I.Q. would even come close to matching songs with the producer without peeking at the liner notes.     Far continues Spektor's trend of quirky female piano pop that many people try but fail to get her recognition (it is no surprise that she recently recorded with her male counterpoint Ben Folds). Really, Spektor is the only person that could wax poetic about a DJ forgetting to take November Rain off of repeat and turn it into a kids sing a long for a video or turn heart and fall into fifteen syllable words. And that continues on the new album whether she is making dolphin sounds on Folding Chair, a chorus that just repeats the word Eet, lines about making computers out of macaroni (The Calculation) or creating a whole song about thumping through a stranger's Wallet.     But the strangest of them all may be Dance Anthems of the 80's which despite the title still has Spektor's signature piano instead of the decade's familiar synthesizer. And the oddness of the song is only outdone by the video for Dance Anthems of the 80's. Spektor gets plenty existential on the album like on Blue Lips where the Adam and Eve verses work much better than the simplistic chorus. Or Laughing With where she takes a look at some of the more depressing creations God have given us like poverty, hospitals and natural disasters. While Machine is one of her more brooding song thanks to some heavy percussion and lyrics that deal with humans become one with them.

0307454541|3.0|I found this book interesting while reading the beginning and in the middle but the ending didn't do anything for me.

Very different from others experiences with the book.
B001W63DXC|5.0|Having listened to the entire set for the third time, I just can't get enough of this amazing collection of metal classics.  First of all, the setlist is unreal. For those of us who are old enough to have seen the original tour in 1984 - 1985, this brings back memories of a time when all things were great in the world of metal and hard rock!<br /><br />Up until now, Life After Death was THE bible on that era...but no more.  These perfromances are just too good to ignore.  Bruce is singing like he is in his teens but with a maturity that reflects one of the eras greatest vocalists.<br /><br />The three headed monster of Gears, Smith and Murray didn't make sense to me at first and the studio recordings with the three of them had not convinced me. But here they shine like never before!  The triple leads on \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" give me chills!  INCREDIBLE!!<br /><br />Steve Harris is so solid you could set your watch by his powerful playing!<br /><br />But the real hero is Mr. McBrain. This is his greatest moment with Iron Maiden! The tempos are perfect, his playing is frantic and controlled at the same time. A feat not easily done.  The power, the speed and the control are amazing to watch and listen to.  He is 1000% better then on Live After Death and the band is better for it.<br /><br />Now I can't leave out Kevin Shirley's massive recording.  Each player is easily heard in the mix but together create a wall of sound almost never re-created before.  I love the background keys on the chorus of \\"Powerslave\\" it makes the whole song.<br /><br />This now ranks up there with KISS Alive, Live and Dangerous, Made in Japan and other all time classic hard/heavy live recordings of all time!<br /><br />UP THE IRONS...Maiden is once again the biggest metal act in the world...BAR NONE!!<br /><br />peace

1439130833|5.0|I've been into the Law of Attraction for a few years now. But clearly it is one thing to understand its principles and another thing to actually live it.After so many years of thinking one way, it does take time to change the way you think.I 'know it'but to'do it' is another story. The key for me is to have a continuous reminder to keep me on track. First, I found [[ASIN:B001IW9OJ2 Living The Secret Everyday: My Secret Meditation]]<br />a CD which I try to listen to at least 15 minutes a day (both am and pm when I have time)...a great refresher to keep me focused on positive thoughts.Motivating, it reminds me to really live the Law of Attraction. This calendar does a similar thing; I take a page out daily as a reminder.If you are serious about changing your life these are must-have tools.
B00000IQW3|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow!  I just got my 30 Day Shred DVD in the mail today and I was so excited to try it out!  I just got done, and what a kick in the butt that was!  I consider myself in decent shape but this was quite the work out!  I was doing aerobic exercises (elliptical for about 25 min) 5 days/week for about 3 months, but then I started lagging when summer started.  I heard a lot of good things about this DVD, so when I wanted something to get me back into the habit, I thought this one would be good!  I think I'm at a good weight for me (about 130 and 5'7\\"), so I'm not worried so much about losing pounds, but losing inches and toning up my softer areas like my stomach/abs.    I definitely like that the various exercises only come in short 30 second-1 minute bursts, which helps keep me going. While the actual time it took seemed very short (really, it's only 20 minutes!), the work out was definitely intense, which made it feel worth it!  The hardest parts were some of the strength exercises.  I was debating on which size weights to get to use with this DVD.  I bought 5 lb weights thinking that the 3 lb ones wouldn't be enough.  I sure wished I had the 3 lb weights for a couple of the strength exercises!  If in doubt, go with the lower weights and get the higher ones as you improve.  5 lbs was definitely too much on a couple.    Another thing, be prepared to sweat!!  I was in my basement with the air conditioning on when I did this work out. It's the coldest area of the house and usually I'm chilled just sitting down there.  After this work out, even in short shorts and a sports bra, I was sweating up a storm!  I'll try to remember to keep this updated and let people know how it goes... definitely looking forward to my stamina improving as I continue with this!
0452270073|5.0|Regeneration is the first in the Pat Barker (born in Yorkshire in 1943 and the winner of the Booker Prize) novels on World War I from the English point of view.<br />  This initial volume takes place at a military hospital in Scotland. It is a hospital specializing in shell shock and soldiers experiencing psychological traumas following conflict in the hellhole of the French trenches. Several of the patients and their cases are presented.<br />  The main character is Dr. William Rivers a psychologist who is a compassionate man. Rivers family knew the author Lewis Carroll and he comes from a economically comfortable social milieu. Rivers stutters and has disturbing dreams about the war. He admires the moral stand taken by Sassoon but knows he has been ordered to regenerate him for active duty back in the Dantean hell of the French front.<br />  The novel begins with a letter of protest written by Lt. Siegrfried Sassoon who expresses his outrage for the senseless slaughter on the Western Front. He is a brave officer who has been decorated for his heroism but is sent home to recuperate in Scotland. After several months he will be returned to active duty. Sassoon has several famous pacifists for friends including philosopher Bertrand Russell; novelist H.G. Wells and his fellow British officer Robert Graves who would later write \\"I Claudius\\" and his own war memoir.<br />  Rivers tells us of the friendship which developed between Sassoon and the young poet Wilfred Owen who admired Sassoon's published poetry. These two men and Rivers are historical figures. Sassoon survived the war dying in 1967 while Owen was killed in France during the last days of the war in 1918.<br />  A fictional character Billy Prior is initially mute when he comes to the hospital but regains his voice. Billy falls in love with a munition factory worker who comes from a lower class than he. Barker discusses their sex scenes in explicit terms. Barker also uses slang and profanity as she invents words for the characters to speak.<br />  This is a wonderful anti-war novel showing the stupidity, brutality and the high cost of war on the lives of all who are involved in its madness.<br />Barker's prose is spare reminding this reviewer of a Hemingwayesque style.<br />The novel is one of the best by a British author in the 1990s.

B0000VCZKM|1.0|I was so excited about getting this movie at such a good deal on the price, because I love musicals. When we watched the movie, I was shocked to find that they used the Lords name in vein in this movie. I bought this movie for my nine year old child and when I received the movie I did not want to watch it much less let my nine year old. People selling these movies need to be more specific about the ratings...this movie is not a G rated movie in my opinion. I would buy more movies if they would leave the bad language out or edit them somehow.

0792844793|5.0|Those familiar with Francis Ford Coppola's surreal psychedelic Vietnam War epic \\"Apocalypse Now\\" will probably remember Dennis Hopper as sidekick and foil to Kurtz, a character who represented the savage desires and hidden thoughts buried deep within the shadows of all men's hearts. In \\"Blue Velvet,\\" Dennis Hopper has graduated from the sidekick to that character, and is now its very embodiment. Change the setting from wartime Vietnam to small town America, put Kyle MacLahan in the role of Captain Marlow, and you may have just described \\"Blue Velvet.\\"   In David Lynch's \\"Blue Velvet,\\" Dennis Hopper is Frank Booth, a psychotic criminal whose hobbies include drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon, dealing drugs, committing murder, inhaling vast amounts of Amyl Nitrate, and (in oh so many words) having sex with anything that moves. Among Frank's most recent crimes is blackmailing a young woman named Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rosselini) into having extremely twisted sex with him by holding her family hostage.   Meanwhile, a student named Jeffrey Beaument (Kyle MacLahan) returns from school to his small town home to visit his injured father. While there, he discovers a severed ear in a field that eventually leads him to stalk Dorothy and earn the jealousy and hatred of Frank.   As Jeffrey confronts Frank, more and more clues come into play that Jeffrey's struggle is not against Frank, but against himself: \\"You're like me,\\" Frank hisses to Jeffrey, following a spine-chilling rendition of Roy Orbison's \\"In Dreams,\\" throwing Jeffrey's own morality into question.   From the very beginning, Blue Velvet plays out like a Blakean fever-dream about the struggle between good and evil and the contrast between innocence and experience. Those who watch this film should expect a journey through the hidden reaches of their own psyche, and to find their own most wicked and monstrous dreams reflected within.

I have purchased all the books available in the Song of Fire and Ice series and CAN NOT put them down. The characters are deep, the story line unpredictable, and the writing could not be improved.<br /><br />I have read this genre my whole life, and love Martin simply because he lets you fill in the details. He doesn't feel the need to describe EVERY battle, and EVERY day of the life of EVERY character (ie Robert Jordan). This makes it a compelling read. You will have your favorite characters!

B001SGEUNI|5.0|I saw Halestorm in concert last night here in Charleston.  All I can say is that this band is even better live than on CD, and the CD rocks.  Fantastic CD filled with some of the catchiest hard rock tunes I've heard in quite a while.  They are also an amazing live band, so check them out if they come to your town.  I've got a feeling the next time I see them it will be in a much larger venue.

B001V9LRV0|3.0|I have the original Woodstock album 3 record set that I have loved for years. The music of the time was nothing but fantastic. I was hoping with this 40th Anniversary set that it would all be in order as it should be so you can feel the true experience. Most of the songs I have loved for years are on the new DVD but instead of placing them in order of bands and events the DVD jumps back and forth from one day to another. Ten Years After cuts into the middle of the great performance of Crosby, Still, Nash and Young. Their entire performance together is fantastic especially since it is the first time these 4 are ever seen live. I love Ten Years After doing \\"Going Home\\", but I know the stage didn't stop to switch these guys around. After all these year lets put this entire experience as it happened not how someone is worried that we might be bored by seeing one band play too long. Trust me we are adults and I for one know I could handle seeing it as it happened.<br /><br />Author Paul Maddams<br />\\"Happy Birthday Mr. Sidney\\"

The movie moves along at a steady pace and keeps you cheering him on. About the only thing I couldn't handle in the film, are the scenes when his daughter is running in the house...she looked as though she had a handicap. But as a father myself, the movie made me think how far I would go to save my kids if they were abducted. Great movie!!!
1439102813|3.0|Although this is beautifully written, Still Alice by Lisa Genova is truly unpleasant to read.  And the warm, fuzzy, family reconciliation ending-- is sugar-coated, stopping well before the final horrendous stage of the disease.
B000AYEL6U|3.0|It was a \\"nice\\" story - certainly not a great one.  If I had missed an installment, well - se la vie.    I knew who were the good guys and who were the not so good, as well as knowing how it would end long before the characters knew.  However, I still don't understand why the emphasis on the title was as it was. It really wasn't that important.  It was a family that had moved from one part of England to another - as simple as that.    As I said before, it was a nice story, but not much more.
B001KVZ6F2|3.0|Okay ,Clint Eastwood is brilliant from all sides of the camera.   He also looks great for being almost 80.   The film has a great storyline.Its about an angry old man named walt who just lost his wife and no one cares that he lost his wife, The grandkids make a mockery of his wife's funeral and his son's just shrug it off and kind of think its puzzling that he is so mad at them.  He has every right to be angry,he has lung cancer and hates what is happening to his neighbourhood. a gang of thugs so vicious even the police are afraid of them  have taken over and rape,steal kill and destroy whenever they feel like it. The only who cares beside Walt is a pudgy, young priest who has no idea what he is doing.  So Walt starts taken care of things on his own,he also helps a wimpy kid get it together so he can make it in the world.  I had a problem with movie,Walt is a giant racist. Seriously, every other sentence out of his mouth is some derogatory word for Jews, Blacks,Koreans, Italians, and irish people.I can't put examples of what he says,because my review would taken off of here.I get that he is a racist, but you don't beat me over the head with how much of a racist he is,It really takes away from the movie.

B00204AA0O|4.0|***I would rate this on the high end between 4 & 5 stars***<br /><br />I am NOT a fan of &#34;popular&#34; music, though this may be classified as &#34;folk&#34; (or &#34;anti-folk&#34; as Regina Spektor seems to have been labeled), I would still think of it basically as &#34;pop.&#34;  Few modern musicians impress me and I tend more toward Classic Rock, MoTown and Classical; feel that it is fair to share that before writing this review.<br /><br />To say that Regina Spektor is impressive is an understatement.  I had not heard of this wonderful artist until a week before the release of this album.  I now intend to buy her entire catalogue; she is a shining example of individuality in the bleak, cloned, irksome and depressing current musical landscape.<br />Her music is excellent, her use of atonality quite catchy.  Her vocals are quirky, she has what I could only call an unconventional singing voice but she sings well with the pipes that God gave her.  The music is great, a spin on the piano centered bands of late but enough of a twist to make it an enjoyable, unique listen.  Many of the piano solos are almost epic in their ability to encompass the mood of the song; much like Classical piano concerto solos or cadenzas, in my humble opinion, but this shouldn't surprise as Spektor is Classically trained.<br /><br />A quick rundown of my impression of each of the songs:<br />5 Stars - 'The Calculation' - THE album standout, in my humble opinion; the only way I can describe it is jazz/blues/reggae/quasi-country fusion.<br />5 Stars - 'Laughing With' and 'Blue Lips' - both have amazing depth & simplicity in what remains astounding as a finished product.<br />5 Stars - 'Eet', 'Folding Chair', 'Machine', 'Human of the Year', 'Two Birds' and 'Genius Next Door' - with creative, strikingly idiosyncratic sound, vocals & lyrics on each these all stand somehow apart from any easily identifiable genre.<br />4 Stars - 'Dance Anthem of the 80's', and 'Man of a Thousand Faces' - both are entertaining but have slightly less sheen overall; still above average.<br />3 Stars - 'Wallet' and 'One More Time with Feeling' - these just didn't hit me as hard as the other offerings but are still worth a listen and register on the high end of the 3 star rating.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album, this artist, and I think that Regina Spektor's star is on the rise.  This should be a Grammy nominee at the least, but honestly I think a Grammy win is deserved.<br /><br />Enjoy!; still above average. 3 Stars - 'Wallet' and 'One More Time with Feeling' - these just didn't hit me as hard as the other offerings but are still worth a listen and register on the high end of the 3 star rating.  I highly recommend this album, this artist, and I think that Regina Spektor's star is on the rise.  This should be a Grammy nominee at the least, but honestly I think a Grammy win is deserved.

B001U0HBPG|5.0|Not since \\"Meet Joe Black\\" have I been so moved by a Brad Pitt film or performance. This movie had such heart. My husband and I sat riveted for two nights (we split it up to watch on weeknights).     The love between Daisy and Benjamin was beautiful and touching.  Benjamin's life was quiet, yet very interesting. I was moved by his generosity of spirit toward his biological father. Daisy & Benjamin's relationship plays out and makes your heart soar to the sky. While it was a tearjerker to watch at times, especially at the end, and I had a lump in my throat, we did not find the movie depressing or a downer. There is the natural cycle to any love.     Blanchett and Pitt are wonderful together. They have great chemistry.
1934030198|2.0|I bought this book in hopes of getting basic triathlon information to augment my beginner triathlon class this summer.  It has some good information but in my opinion, is geared more for people who do triathlons to get on the podium ... not necessarily to challenge themselves in 3 sports or (gasp!) to have fun.  The training programs suggested are far too time consuming and intense for people who have a life outside of training.  I ended up finding training info online for free :(
B00192IV0O|1.0|I got this CD at Target with a bonus CD, and the reviews were correct, this CD SUCKED!!! I could only listen to the first 50 seconds of a song before going to the next song, and the only one i really liked was the most popular one on the radio boom boom pow or whatever it is called. What a waste of money.
0743496736|4.0|Warning Spoilers!    I am a relatively new Jodi Picoult fan, having only read My Sister's Keeper a little while ago.  Having heard that this was better than that book, I was very anxious to read Nineteen Minutes.  I thought that it was incredibly well written and thought provoking. I found myself both hating and empathizing with all of the chararacters in the book during various parts of the story, which was something I had never expected to be able to do.  The complete humiliation that Peter suffered at the hands of the popular boys (ie Matt and Drew) was gut wrenching and after reading about the scene when they humiliate him in the cafeteria, a part of me actually understood why he went on his rampage.     I was also really drawn to the character of Josie.  I thought that Picoult wrote about her in such a way that I couldn't help connecting with her.  Especially in regards to her very complex relationship with her boyfriend Matt.  That being said, I absolutely HATED HATED the very end of the book.  Having become such a big fan of Josie and being able to understand how she could still love Matt even though he was abusive, I felt that her actions at the end of the book were unrealistic and not at all what the character I had come to know would do.      I have been told that Picoult loves to end her books with a twist that you don't see coming.  Unfortunately in this instance, it ruined the book for me.  Even ruined, I still have had difficulty thinking of little else since I finished reading it.
0684833395|5.0|The book was in better shape than expected. Decently fast shipping. It was obscenely cheap.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I'm not gonna rehash the basic premise and stars of this series; you probably know that already. I'll just say that TV shows as intelligent, literate, and adult (not to mention well-acted) as this one are few and far between, and I intend to enjoy it for however long it lasts. I didn't think Gabriel Byrne was ever gonna find a better part than \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" but he fits into this role like Kingsley into Gandhi or George C. Scott into Patton. And Alison Pill was robbed by not receiving an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of the grad student with cancer. I bought season 1 on DVD, and I'll be all over season 2. HIGHLY recommended.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred is AMAZING! I have never stuck with an excersice dvd the way that I do with her, it's like she is right there with me, pushing me  harder and celebrating my accomplishments. I have never before had the definition I am starting to see in my abs after only 15 days !! There are some moves that are hard on the knees, but don't let that discourage you - she always offers modifications to help out. By level 2 I had sweat dripping into my eyes, for a 20 min workout you could not ask for more then this, my husband says I look so skinny, but the truth is I have only lost 6 lbs however, what he is seeing is fat melting, I am becoming leaner and stronger, the lbs loss is just a bonus to how great you will look, it' s not about the scale, it's about being SHREDDED!!
B00001U0DP|5.0|\\"Fairy Tales can come true,it can happen to you, when you're \\"Young at Heart\\".  The horror of this Holocaust story is balanced by the overcoming  love and care  of a father for his child's view of life.When I think  of the unspeakable depravity and inhumanity of man toward  his fellow man I also remember this father improvising  circumstances  to lead his child to that table prepared for him in the \\"presence of his   enemies\\" hopefully to deliver him \\"from evil\\".  \\"Greater love has no man  than that he lay down his life for a friend\\" (in this case a beloved child) has   never been expressed better than in this film..                To movie buffs,critics and intellectuals, this maybe just another, albeit  Oscar winning, \\"Holocaust\\" movie like Schindler's List or The Boy in the Striped   Pajamas but, like the latter, it raises (and answers in the affirmative) the question  of the ultimate immeasurable value of life and man's ability to chose (he can)  life in the face of ultimate Evil.
B001HN697M|2.0|The story line was slow developing and I had trouble identifying with the character groups as they intermingled throughout the story line.    I would not pay to see this film at a movie house but for a quick down and dirty rentql it kills time.
0316154687|5.0|I have enjoyed Sedaris' stories for years, in books, on NPR, and on long road trips when I favor his books on tape over all others.  I find him ridiculous (in a hilarious way) and poignant as an author.  This book is my very favorite yet.<br /><br />I have to say that not every story in this book made me crack up laughing aloud.  Many did, of course, but not every one.  There was a great depth of emotion in this particular collection, and I found my heart aching for some characters and the author himself at various points in the book, then doubling up laughing again in no time.  All my favorite humorists convey serious messages as well, and all of the best comedians can make you laugh at something terribly tragic without losing the importance of it.<br /><br />My only regret about this book is that I read it so very quickly -- devoured it, really.  I wish that I had savored it and extended my enjoyment as long as physically possible!

B001FB4VZS|4.0|Season 8 of Smallville isn't the best, but it isn't the worst in my opinion. What made me enjoy this season so much was that they're finally putting more clois scenes. The past seasons of Clark being with Lana was just plain boring and annoying. Lana use to be so sweet and kind, but as the seasons went her character was becoming so annoying that i stopped watching this show until season 8. Clark's pining over Lana was also becoming very annoying. Clark and Lois was what made me continue watching Smallville. Tom Welling and Erica Durance's chemistry was just pure bliss this season. Their scenes together are the greatest and always put a smile on my face. The first 10 episodes were good, but the Clana arc was when the show screwed up. What disappointed me was that the writers could have made Clark realize his feelings for Lois and break things off with Lana. But, no we got Clark still having feelings for Lana and kissing and having sex with her. I was so disgusted and angry that i almost broke the remote. After that the show kept making bad episode after the other. There were episodes that were pretty good and others that disappointed me like Doomsday. Doomsday was a pretty bad season finale and got my hopes way too up. Well hopefully next season won't mess around and bring back Lana. Blame the writers, blame the budget, but don't blame the actors and actresses because I think they did a wonderful job.

1591841216|5.0|It took me about an hour of slow reading to devour the book. It'll probably take me some time to master the principles.<br /><br />In that sense, it is like Tao Te Ching.<br /><br />So here is a review in accord with the spirit of the book:<br /><br />Instead of spending your time reading books from Malcolm Gladwell, read what Paul Arden has to say about life, business, success and failure.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I have seen both versions of this film several times, and I will say that the Director's Cut is far superior to the Theatrical Cut. Typically I don't feel this way about films (Apocalypse Now, for example) but the DC version vastly improves the character development, plot, and historical questions that the TC failed to offer. I have never considered this film to be anti-Muslim or even anti-Christian: as far as Hollywood is capable, I felt that this was fair to both sides of the debate, without offering what I might consider serious revisionist problems. It correctly established that Jerusalem was brutalized by both sides, Christians when they first re-took the city and by the Muslims as they attempted to re-take it. For a complete discussion of the differences between the film and history, you would need to consult a website or book on the subject; but I felt that Ridley Scott achieved rare distinction with this film, far more so than with Gladiator, perhaps on par with Black Hawk Down.     The sets are well-crafted, the cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, and the plot well-established. I personally felt that Orlando Bloom did quite well in this film, even if his character does not \\"pop\\" as one might expect from the main character of an epic film; but his quiet intelligence is equal to the real Balian, even if the other details of his biography are not accurate. I feel that this film will provide one with a new take on the Middle East and the fluid, often subtle struggles that occur between the three religions in Jerusalem. Whether this new take offers anything valid to the discussion is not the point; I see the history of the Middle East differently because of the film, and I see the city itself differently. This film also encouraged a resurge of my interest in the Crusades, which is a worthy result of such a well-formed and well-acted film.     If you choose to see this film, this is the version you should see. I do not believe that you will be disappointed.

B00006K0BE|5.0|I'm not sure if the previous reviewer was listening to the same album, because this is one of the best sounding records I own. It is a double LP set, so the quality is amazing. Highly recommended.

B00009MGGI|5.0|This was a terrific political thriller with a lot going on.  Easy enough to follow though.  Ian Richardson did an incredible job!  It involves Ian Richardson playing the part of the Chief Whip in Parliment as he manipulates people and events to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming Prime Minister.  All three parts should be seen.  House of Cards, To Play the King and The Final Cut.
0735619670|4.0|This is an excellent book. It covers topics that every programmer should be intimately familiar with. While some of the sections feel like they might be stating the obvious, they are still worth the read. Steve is an extremely talented writer, and can make even the most mundane of topics fun to read. If you are a new programmer, then I think this book is especially important for you, since it will guide you into the right habits from the very beginning. It is much harder to break bad habits, so if you're new to programming, don't just focus on learning how to program, read this book too and learn how to be a professional programmer.
0439023483|5.0|This very well written novel keeps you in suspense right up to the very end and leaves you wishing the sequel was already out! I do not typically read this type of fiction and would never have picked it up if it had not been recommended to me. I grudgingly began reading and I was captured almost instantly. There is no noticeable formula writing here. The author takes you on a journey into the future and each character forms a place in your heart as you are gripped by the suspense. While it can be somewhat gruesome it is not scary and it leaves you with a lot to think about. I recommend this book from pre-teen through adult and I can't wait to see the sequel.
0307346617|5.0|Every night that I read this book, I had nightmares of the zombie-pocalypse. This was a great read, full of terrifying images of a fantastic history that has never happened.  I was scared, and moved to tears at times. I even started to evaluate whether my house was zombie proofed. I highly recommend this book.
0060254920|5.0|I've been in love with this book ever since I was a little kid, and still have my old, worn copy!  (Maybe I should get a new one?)  I always identified with Max, since I was a mischievous and imaginative child as well.  The best pages are the ones where he goes on a wild rumpus with all the Wild Things, which are some of the most lovely and amazing creatures I've ever seen!  I'll be interested to see whether the movie can possibly live up to the warm fuzzies I get any time I even think of this book.
0439023483|5.0|I was almost immediately taken by the tone of this novel. It had this wonderfully soft and basic tone to it.  The author did a wonderful job keeping things basic, not being overly descriptive or dragging things out, and always keeping things very interesting. And the story mixed very well with this pace and freedom.  I enjoyed this book thoroughly. I loved the world that Suzanne Collins has created from the dust and disaster of her imagination.   This book has the feel of a flower growing up magestically centered in an ugly urban landscape. It's bleak but filled with hope, and most of all this book is thoroughly enjoyable probably for all ages.     This book is often compared or contrasted with Twilight, or the Twilight Series.  I see no connection there other then the protaganists are female teens.  This story is on a whole seperate level then Twilight, so much better that I am baffled by comparisons.        I'm definitely looking forward to Book 2, Catching Fire, in September of this year to see if she can continue this wonderful story and way of storytelling.

B001P9KR8U|2.0|This is a silly film that does not deserve the plaudits it has been given. It plays to the current western ideology that the glorification of the self is the paramount aim in life, and money and celebrity are the great goals to pursue. The end is seamed predictably into the first scene, and the movie simply unraps its layers towards the inevitable conclusion. The tension built into the narrative is Disney schmaltz - that is, we are happy to follow the characters through their mistakes and hardships because we know all will come out right in the end.<br /><br />This is not how life, let alone life in slum communities in India works. If such a film was made about American society it would be pilloried as a piece of Hollywood feelgood pap, profiting out of the naive chimera of the American Dream, as experienced by the poor. Set in India, it offers only a few colourful set pieces that show the hardships of slum life, rather than doing much to intelligently challenge and educate our perceptions of such societies.
B00005QW5X|5.0|I watched this film originally for a class, but needless to say I was breathless and in near tears at the end!  The story isn't in the movie, it is in the music; the lyrics tell the story of Hedgewig and express her loss, her anger, everything about her.  The end is kind of abrupt, but if the viewer sits and thinks for a minute it is deep and touching.  I can't wait to recieve my copy.    I don't dicredit those who saw the movie as bizaar, it could be seen as a little OTT, but it all fits Hedgewig and her life...and if you look at the artists Hedgewig styles her music after, the visuals fit into the picture very well...glam-punk it's all there.  I challenge anyone who didn't like it from the first showing to sit down and look at it again, thinking about the different elements of the film and the story and how they all tie together to make this piece of art.  This is not a movie to take at just face value, it runs so much deeper than that.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I'm learning to use and the quality of my indoors photos have improved a lot. I recommend it even if you are not a professional.
B001FB4VZS|3.0|Season 8: I like the beginning more than the end.  I loved where things were going with Lois.  After all, she, NOT Lana, was the love of Superman's life. Lana was never more than Clark's high school girlfriend.  I agree with krypton kid's review, where he said the writers could have used the 5 episodes with Kristen Kreuk to allow Clark to see that he was really in love with Lois.  Instead, they completely cooled down a hot relationship with his head back into Lana, as if it wasn't for the krypton keeping them apart, he would have stayed with her.  Humbug!  This would have been a great way to have brought Erica Durance back in. Instead, there was no way you could believe Clark was in love with her after the 5 episodes with Lana. Made her seem like seconds. Of course, the fact that she was off the show for over a month after the terrific Bride episode was a big mistake, IMHO.<br /><br />So... I think the show didn't go where it could have gone. I was hoping to see Clark finally fly, Lois step up in their relationship (I loved the episode \\"Committed\\" where she has to admit to Clark that she loved him), and I would have liked to see them bring in Perry White. After 8 years, they can advance Clark's age a bit (they do not have to stick to a High School year per season mentality) and get him into the meat of being a hero. In the comic books, Clark was never so unsure of himself as Tom Welling is made to play him. I was more than fed up of seeing him so needy and insecure all the time. I was ready to see him become a force to be reckoned with.
B00068TJM6|4.0|I purchased this last year and have been wearing it occasionally since. This watch is an absolute beauty. It looks a lot better in real. Very classy. The belt is two-tone and feels solid. The center portion is a lot shinier than shown in pictures... almost like a mirror... looks very pretty. The dial is busy but easy to read. I have tiny wrists (7 inches) and this watch doesn't appear too big. I had to take off a few links of the bracelet though. I don't use the chronograph functions at all so no comments there. I have two complaints with this watch. The first is that the date function is not automatic, for months having less than 31 days - you'll have to manually correct the date. At this price, I think it wouldn't be totally unjustified to expect this watch to do my laundry and it doesn't even have automatic date! My second complaint is about the design of the three crowns on the right. They have sharp grooves and they look very cool but make it slightly uncomfortable to wear (as I wear it on my left arm - no issue if you wear it on your right arm). In the end, I'd like to mention how absolutely gorgeous this watch is. I forget about all it's shortcomings every time I gawk at it (and that happens multiple times per day).<br /><br />11/12/2009 EDIT: After wearing this watch for quite some time, I have now gotten used to the sharp crowns and it does not bother me any more. My complaint about the manual date function still holds though.
1600243916|4.0|I have been reading Gladwell systematically in past. He is certainly author of great talent to tell interesting stories with serious message attached to it.     The Blink book has been a large disapointment for me. Great start and than the steam of the story went off till the end. Therefore I was a bit sceptical about the Outliers.     However, luckily enough, Gladwell did not fall in the same trap again this time. Book is logically narrated and offers interesting alternative view on (often already) known facts and life stories. What I consider to be author's strength is meticulous detail to support the argument with real facts and quotes.     The very peek of the story is a bit personal from Gladwell, what makes the book a bit more special !!! My highest regards. Mr. Gladwell, you have won back my trust to your skills to serve reader/listener with thought-provoking bits that bite.
B00005QBER|5.0|5 stars = Masterpeice<br /><br />Absolute top flight album!<br /><br />\\"Lovedrive\\" ranks right up there with \\"In Trance\\" for a tie of my favorite Scrops album. Killer stuff here & not a bad cut to be found! Melodic, but heavy, \\"Lovedrive,\\" (album) is all over the board sonically. \\"Another Piece of Meat,\\" just rips & roars at full throttle! \\"Holiday,\\" on the other end of the spectrum, may be the Scrops best ballad. It really takes you away! Everything else in between is just lean mean tasty meat for this sonic sub sandwich for your muse to devour!<br /><br />Klaus Meine really is on top of his game here, adding his potent pipes for what may be his best vocal performance. Micheal Schenker reunites with his brother Rudolf, & Matthais Jabs proves he can take the reigns for lead guitar on latter albums. They make for a towering trio of shiny metallic leads, bent on a mission to pierce your brain through your ears!<br /><br />If you could only have two Scorpion albums, \\"Lovedrive,\\" & \\"In Trance\\" are the ones to have. Enough good music here to take you on a well deserved holiday!
B00065MDSQ|5.0|Me, I have an obsession with this band. I actually love all their albums (yes including the fantastic, yet hated, Islands and ConstruKction of Light). In this album, they became a three-piece band.... with past players still present..... whatever. Now just what type of music will you find in this album? Their heaviest rock of that era. The album hits you hard with RED, an instrumental track doing everything it can to be loud, but satisfying. In the middle is my favourite part of the song, a cello solo with the guitar making simple noise with a swirl effect in your speakers. FALLEN ANGEL features beautiful vocal work by Wetton and nice instrumental work by the band. ONE MORE RED NIGHTMARE features a slight remixed section of RED popping up in a few spots, but it is definitely it's own song. It has the band doing a well written jam session. PROVIDENCE is a lengthy improvised instrumental. The only problem I have with the song, and it's only a minuscule gripe, is that it has some really quiet sections that are difficult to hear sometimes. Which, sadly, happens a bit in their earlier discography. Anyway, back to the song. It's weird, it's spooky, and it's crazy fun as Wetton and Fripp completely blow your mind with wonderful noise. Great violin work by David Cross, who is the reason this sounds spooky. And finally, the really epic song STARLESS It start out with a smooth jazz feel accompanied by great vocals. It then transitions to a very hypnotic movement with Fripp playing only a few notes repeatedly. Along with sound effects, and other instruments popping in eventually, the music slowly reaches intensity until it switches to a heavy jazz section. Followed by more heavy hypnotic guitar, and then an intense, but beautiful reprise of the opening section. It's a busy song, yes, but it a great song to lose yourself into, as you feel hypnotized and nervous.    To sum it up... A VERY good record to blast on your stereo and just listen. I still get shivers from this album.
B001KS4GQ0|5.0|I received this product in less than a week after placing the order. It was exactly as described on the website. Thank you very much!
B000F4LGDQ|4.0|This single-disc compilation is as near-perfect as you can get to capturing the very essence of Cream. Those who are already fortunate enough to possess all four Cream albums already would still do well to pick up this compilation, as it contains two rare singles, \\"Wrapping Paper\\" and \\"Anyone for Tennis,\\" the latter being a catchy little Eric Clapton/Martin Sharp song.     While this represents one of the greatest supergroups of all time, it fails to represent a vital anchor to the band's sound: drummer Ginger Baker. Two tracks of the 20-track compilation are songs in which Ginger Baker co-wrote (\\"Sweet Wine\\" and \\"Those Were The Days\\") and while these songs are excellent, one cannot ignore the sad fact that \\"Toad,\\" \\"Blue Condition,\\" and \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\" were virtually ignored here. Granted, these weren't exactly smash hits for the group, but it leaves out a significant part of this amazing group.
B0026J8LHM|3.0|Dream Theater's 10th studio release finds the band in top form musically. Most of the amazon reviews are correct - this is possibly the best DT album since Scenes from a Memory. It is engaging without being overwhelming (as Scenes is often accused of), fresh without being forced (as Train of Thought is often accused of), and diverse without suffering from incoherency (as was certainly the case with both Octavarium and Systematic Chaos). The arrangements generally avoid the \\"dueling keyboard and guitar\\" pitfall that has plagued the last few releases. LaBrie is the only member who doesn't quite live up to earlier glories here, probably due to the inevitable loss of range that we've witnessed with other stratospheric singers like Walsh, Geddy Lee, etc. No matter, his lower range lends itself well to the band's typically darker sound of late. In some places he sounds downright sinister (as on A Rite of Passage) but it's much better tempered than many of the aggressive tracks on Train of Thought. In other words, this is a band that is aging well, still growing and experimenting, while retaining the sound that made them unique in a sea of prog-metal and neo-classical metal bands. They still have that spark that always seems to be lacking in other bands such as Symphony X or Iced Earth. And they've certainly aged better than many of their influences like Metallica, Megadeth, Yes, or Iron Maiden.<br /><br />So why only three stars? On repeated listens, the lyrics are just terrible. Other's have said it in their reviews and I'll repeat it here - the lyrics are cringe inducing in places. Objectively they may stand up to their contemporaries or label mates like Slipknot or Trivium, but those bands have insipid lyrics on every possible level. One of the primary things that made DT stand out from the crowd in the early days was the fact that, like most bands of this style, they weren't singing about dragons and mystical spaceships. The themes were mysterious and even \\"new-agey\\" (thanks to original key player Kevin Moore), then went on to deal poetically and intelligently with every imaginable subject from addiction to family conflict, death, the afterlife, re-incarnation, and social issues. It was \\"thinking man's metal\\" not just because of the technical skill of the band, but because they were writing lyrics that were relevant, empathetic, and smart.<br /><br />Something changed with Systematic Chaos and continues here, due mostly to John Petrucci's lyrics. SC was an interesting diversion into Dark Masters, prophecy, vampires, undead pharaoh zombies, ghosts, and other stereotypical prog/death metal fodder. Most of it was good (Dark Eternal Night, Forsaken, etc.). I think most fans took it for what it was, breathed a sigh of relief that it was over, and moved on. If BCASL had more of the same, I wouldn't be as critical. Unfortunately, most of the lyrics on this album have taken on subject matter that is less interesting, more mundane, and much less smart that what DT fans have come to expect from such excellent lyricists. Again, the bulk of the blame falls to Pettruci (and possibly Portnoy and LaBrie for not sending him back to the closet with a fresh piece of paper). Car wrecks, free-masons, writer's block, a count who 'scared' him on a trip to Florence? What's so painful is that the music behind these lyrics is absolutely phenomenal - I fear I'll be listening to the instrumental versions more than the normal one, just to avoid the embarrassment of the lyrics. Portnoy's tribute to his father aside (The Best of Times), it's very painful to compare most of the themes and lyrics to past gems, or even to Systematic Chaos, which was already the weakest album lyrically thus far. Even the conclusion to the Recovery Suite (The Shattered Fortress) feels tacked on, thrown together, and retreads too much familiar ground, even for a finale (there's simply no comparison to \\"One Last Time\\" from SFAM, or the finale of SDOIT). I'm not sure what's happening here, but it is disappointing at best, frustrating at worst.<br /><br />I wish DT was a band I could listen to for the music only and ignore the rest. Fortunately, these guys are usually \\"the whole package\\" - music, lyrics, images, artwork, live shows, attention to detail, great concepts, etc. When another band falls short in one of these areas, I tend to give them a pass. Maybe DT deserves one after 10 albums and 20 years, but it's difficult to let them off the hook two albums in a row for the same crime when we know how much more they are capable of.<br /><br />My recommendation - get the 3 disc set. If you can tolerate the lyrics, good for you. If not, there's always the instrumental version to tide you over until the next LTE release. Regardless, DT deserves all the respect and awe given them by their fans, and it would take much more than bad lyrics to put me off buying anything they did.

I'm just trying to be fair in my review, and hopefully my love and admiration for the guys shines through the criticism (can you tell it pains me to criticize them at all?).
B002CNV52A|5.0|Having everything they have ever released, I would rate this very highly in their catalog. It mixes all styles they have produced, and displays their trademark musicianship. The key here is that the songs are absolutely strong and keep the listener engaged. Everyone in the band is in top form. Great job guys!
0790729377|5.0|This line, from the pen of Tennessee Williams is so true, especially for we people of tender psyches.  I had not seen this in years and it was a delight to watch--especially with the uncensored director's cut that contained scenes and gestures blocked by the censors at the time.  A streetcar of any other name would not have smelled as sweet.  This movie, its rich and sometimes hazy black and white tones, won three Oscars for acting alone.  It is not hard to understand why when you see the young Marlon Brando portraying Stanley Kowalski, bad boy, and Kim Hunter playing Stella! Stella! Stella! his pregnant wife with abused spouse syndrome.  Vivien Leigh, the Brit who has nailed Southern womanhood famously and truly almost steals the show.  Karl Malden is excellent as Blanche Dubois' confused and emotionally drained suitor.  We feel he truly loves her in spite of what she is, but any chances they had were interfered with by Stanley who is vindictive because Louisiana's Napoleonic Code will bear no fruit for him in the wake of the demise of the Belle Rive, Dubois family estate.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I rented WALL*E because it looked like a fun bit of comedy and with well done animation--and it's all that as well--but ended up absolutely amazed at how meaningful and significant the story is.<br /><br />No spoilers here, but at first I thought it was about a robot that, because he is a complex system and had been left running indefinitely, had developed human-like intelligence and personality, but as the movie progressed I found this increadibly deep story to be more on the level of social satire or philosophy.<br /><br />Though I'm tempted to say more about the 'life' of the robots versus the humans at this point, as promised, I will not spoil it since I enjoyed the unfolding of the details while watching it for the first time.<br /><br />I'm not saying this because I'm an overeducated geek who looks for deep meaning where there is none; in fact I rented this film just for good old fashion dumb entertainment; but I wouldn't be writing one of my few-and-far-between movie reviews if I didn't think the film was brilliant.<br /><br />There's just enough actual dialogue to keep it from becoming some kind of esoteric film, and yet kids and girlfriends alike will love it because the story is romantic and cute.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Both graphically and in terms of story line, WALL*E is elegant without having gone off the deep end so that you no longer feel like you're watching an animated comedy feature but being schooled instead.  This is neither a graphic masterpiece or something that will be up for a Nobel Prize, but if you want to expose both yourself and your children to something both entertaining and thought provoking, this is an excellent choice.<br /><br />Again, I was absolutely shocked at how great and deeply meaningful this film turned out to be, and I'll be purchasing it for my collection so I can watch it over and over again.
0575056975|5.0|If you are a fan of Terry Pratchett, you'll like this adaptation of 'Mort'. If you haven't heard of him & want to get into the Discworld series, this is a good place to start for the most part.<br /><br />The comic faithfully reproduces Pratchett's tale of Death & Love in nicely colored pictures. The story follows the titular character of Mort as he tries to find an apprenticeship, only to be apprenticed by Death himself. From there the story takes a comic turn as Mort has to deal with Death's unruly daughter as well as the nasty side of Death- that people actually have to die.<br /><br />I actually had to special order this one from the UK as it isn't available in the US yet & found it well worth the money paid for it. The humor in the book is rather dry at points, but that's the type of humor that Pratchett is well loved for. At the risk of sounding like a Pratchett purist, I had no real complaints with this comic. The only bit of caution I'd give to potential buyers is that if you live in the US you may want to shop around first before plunking down a great deal of money on this comic (the price right now is $80). It's a good comic, but it's not that good. I'd also recommend that if you aren't really that big of a fan of Pratchett that you may want to give this a skip. It was fun to read but I enjoyed the book far more.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I saw a [Duffy] appearance she made on a TV morning show. I stopped in my tracks to listen to her, since then had wanted to hear more. I searched everywhere for her CD and finally found it on Amazon.com. Now I only had heard one song \\"MERCY\\", so I was taking a chance on this CD. WOW!!!!  Duffy \\"Rockferry\\" CD is a must have for everyones music library. From the Rockferry to the last number Distant Dreamer, what a great CD!.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|This is Alanis at her best.  The song 'Not As We' is heartbreaking, vulnerable and beautiful.  I thought she would never again do anything as fabulous as her first album \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" and I personally thought maybe she never would, but this proved me wrong.  Her heart on her sleeve, her vulnerable words, and the plaintive tone in her voice is enough to move even the most heartless!  She has moved in maturity from anger to pain to vulnerability and now has some real wisdom to impart from her journey through life and love.  You won't be disappointed.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|It's hard to be objective when a band means so much to one in an emotional sense. Their last four albums have kept me breathing over these increasingly hopeless times and I am pleased to note that they have met and exceeded my expectations with this album. Highlights include:<br />1. The psychadelic funk-rock opus \\"Teflon\\" with subtle Latin-esque crooning from my favourite Hispanic Diva Cedric Bixler Zavala,<br />2. The subversively evil melancholica that sends pseudo-sexual waves through every waking cell on \\"With Twighlight As My Guide\\", and<br />3. The sneaky warped electronica veiled in chillout that graces the middle passages of \\"Copernicus\\".<br /> So sit back, plug in a pair of Sennheisers and let the eight armed melodic entity that is Octahedron wrap you in its embrace.
B001VGFMBY|5.0|I never expected to like this album all that much (don't really like most of the bands that they are compared to), but figured I would pick it up since it was on sale for $5 anyway.  Turns out to be my favorite album of the year so far.  I cant stop listening to it.  Love it.

0307346617|3.0|Humanity has survived the zombie apocalypse, and in its aftermath one reporter compiles interviews that span the globe and the war's timeline, tracking progress of the war around the globe, from the first infected through the aftermath of all-out war. Exploring classic, slow zombies from an unusual, extensive, world-wide view, World War Z is an impressive effort. Initially it's fascinating, but as it continues it becomes increasingly unbelievable and, as a result, less intriguing and frightening. It remains an absorbing, unusual novel and I recommend it on that basis--but it doesn't fulfill its promise or potential.<br /><br />World War Z explores unoriginal zombies in an original way. The zombies here are in classic form: slow, unintelligent, and hungry for human flesh. It's been done before, but perhaps not so extensively: from the first victims to full-on war, from rural China to Windsor Castle to urban America, from isolated civilian survivors to techno-provisioned military forces, World War Z investigates the worldwide events and impact of a zombie apocalypse from beginning nearly to the end. It's an impressive effort which elevates otherwise-unremarkable zombies to a worldwide terror which is well worth the reader's attention. The interview format introduces personal stories and a human element which makes the effects of the zombies all the more terrifying. It must have taken an impressive amount of research: topics range from apocalyptic survival to submarine warfare, and there's a hefty dose of international politics.<br /><br />And yet--no matter the scope, research, or detail--World War Z is unconvincing. The zombies are the worst of it: Brooks skates around scientific explanations by stating that no one has them, yet; this works the first few times, but as the zombies continue to evade science and common sense they become both less believable and frightening. Meanwhile, some plot points (in particular the American government's early response to the outbreaks) strike me as comically improbable, and the \\"human element\\" is compromised by attempts to make each interview too remarkable, resulting in bombastic and maudlin storytelling, or cover too much emotional or factual territory, making interviews artificially concise and turning interviewees into caricatures. One after another, these little gaffes chip away at an otherwise unusual, fascinating novel. Zombies can be good Halloween fun, but World War Z sets out to make them a believable and immediate terror--and fails, just because the zombies and their war don't feel real. It's a good attempt, and an engrossing quick read, but I hoped for better. Moderately recommended.s comically improbable, and the \\"human element\\" is compromised by attempts to make each interview too remarkable, resulting in bombastic and maudlin storytelling, or cover too much emotional or factual territory, making interviews artificially concise and turning interviewees into caricatures.

B0015DYIH2|4.0|I LOVE this series and this book did not disappoint but I was a little upset over the situation with Jacob. Perhaps, it was because I wanted Jacob with Bella but this made it disturbing. I suppose I understand why S. Meyer's did it but It doesn't mean I have to like it.     I think the only good that can come of this is if Meyer's comes back in a few years and writes a series about Jacob and Renesmee. She will be old enough for an actual love story to occur and we will get to keep all of our favorite characters. Unlikely but possible!    I did enjoy the rest of the book and hopefully the movie will intensify the fight scene.

It is also fair to say, that after reading \\"Presentation Zen\\", i realized I was doing many things right.  However, the most important reason to buy the book, is for all of the things I learned I was doing wrong!  Garr, says many of the same things others have said in their books, but I believe his is the one I'd suggest for a person who doesnt have a lot of time, and wants to create a memorable presentation.  Its an easy ready, quick and informative.  Buy it, you wont be dissappointed!
0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key is one of the best Holocaust books I have ever read.     There are two intertwining stories. One is of American expat journalist Julia Jarmond, living in Paris with her husband and daughter, assigned by her editor to do a story on the Vel De Hiv, the roundup of French Jews in July 1942.     The other story is Sarah, a young girl who was taken with her family from their home to during the roundup of Jews in Paris in July of 1942. In the chaos of their immediate departure, Sarah's younger brother is sent to their secret hiding place.    I could not put this book down, it was not as dry as other Holocaust books. It was thoroughly engrossing and as the mystery of Sarah and her connection to Julia's current life was revealed, I was amazed.  I would definitly reccomend this novell.

1416595546|5.0|What British historian could ever tell me, the former USSR citizen, about Russia and its history, especially Soviet history?<br /><br />This is what I thought before opening the book. I do not quite like historical novels in the first place. And after reading all range of Russian authors from Tolstoy to Shalamov I thought to have a right to be skeptical.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Montefiore's book sucked me in like a giant black hole. Frankly, I have never read any \\"foreign\\" book about Russia that is so true in events, details, characters and language.<br />When I read the first chapter I was almost shocked by incredible style of Simon's writing. I could not believe I was reading an *English* text. I do not understand the magic, I do not know how it is done, but if you want to get an impression how original Tolstoy's text would *feel* in Russian - just read the first chapter of Sashenka.<br /><br />Interestingly, Simon keep changing the writing style as story progress in time eventually making it more and more \\"soviet\\", but original chapter's style is unbeatable.<br /><br />Another moment I want to mention - Simon mixes real and fictional heroes in this novel. Some heroes are 100% real and under their real names, some others (like Sashenka herself) are mix of several people, many of which are easily recognizable if you know this historical period and finally some characters are completely fictional. I ended up Googling some of fictional characters to make sure they were fictional, because Simon made them so incredibly realistic.<br /><br />And, of course not only characters are alive, the every page of the book is. Simon managed to take tons of dusty yellow pages from almost (and up to date) inaccessible KGB archives and resurrected them to tell us their stories. Well, this is all merged into one story, the story that is just not possible to characterize in a short review. Just read the book, it's brilliant.

B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City (2005) After reading several Amazon reviews I saw there was no need to write another except to sign up as an additional uniquely satisfied customer. In the past I have been critical of films with too much explicit violence.  Not so in the case of Sin City which expressed its screen violence filtered through wonderful comic book images which were both realistic and surrealistic at the same time.  Very entertaining and interesting and I rate it at five stars.

0810994739|4.0|Jeff Kinney, Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (Anthem, 2008)<br /><br />Kinney's second installment in the insanely popular Diary of a Wimpy Kid series takes us through Greg Heffley's eighth-grade year, but there's a good deal more focus on Greg's family here, as Kinney examines Greg's relationship with his brother Rodrick more closely. Oh, sure, there's a lot of Rowley (and Greg wondering why the seemingly borderline-slow Rowley seems to get all the girls), and some funny scenes at school, but we get to know the Heffleys a lot better in this volume. As fun and readable as ever. *** ½
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful CD & DVD combination. It's amazing how they creators went around the world and recorded a number of muscians playing a song and melded it into one production as if they were all playing the music together. Both the video and music are phenonmenal. You'll want to watch and listen to the music over & over. It's absolutely cativating. I've watched the DVD countless times & listen to the CD in my car & at home frequently. Once you watch the DVD you are hooked. I've bought six of these DVD/CD's already for friends & family as gifts. I have two copies for myself. It's a great value for the price as well.
B00005K3O4|4.0|Killer Klowns from Outer Space (Stephen Chiodo, 1988)<br /><br />It's now been over twenty years since the initial release of Stephen Chiodo's Killer Klowns from Outer Space, and you know what? It's still just as wild a ride now as it was back in the day. I grant you, while I can't imagine anyone finding it not funny, the film has an extra edge for me because I absolutely loathe clowns. You may not get the scare factor if clowns don't do anything for you, but if you believe they're evil and must be destroyed, you must check this one out. Big time.<br /><br />Do you need a plot summary? I mean, pretty much everything you need to know is in the title of this movie. There are Killer Klowns. They come from Outer Space. You can probably infer from the fact that the movie is longer than two minutes that they don't crash land or show up in the middle of the Gobi Desert. So there are a bunch of humans around for the Klowns to prey on, and some of them band together to stop the Klowns. In other words, your typical Killer Klown movie. Cotton candy guns? Check. Klown Kar? Check. Spaceship? Check. What more do you need?<br /><br />This is a silly movie, and if you go into it expecting the next incarnation of Citizen Kane, you're bound to be disappointed. I mean, come on, it's a movie called Killer Klowns from Outer Space. If you don't see the cheese factor writ large, you're going to hate this. But oh, if you are fond of the promise contained in the name, you will find many things to enjoy here. There's some half-decent acting (and a wonderful turn from John Vernon, probably best remembered these days for Animal House), cheap-but-effective special effects, and most importantly, a good number of laughs. If you have somehow missed this one over the years, check it out posthaste. *** ½
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Even though Michael Jackson's personal life was rocked with scandal and I didn't always approve of his antics but I cannot ignore the cultural impact this gifted performer had on me as a child. I was in born in 1982, I remember hearing him on the radio and thought wow what a voice! The song was Dirty Diana from his Bad album. It wasn't until 1991 when his Dangerous album was released that I became a fan of Jackson, Black or White was a stellar video and the cd was just pure pop candy, I ate it up! After the scandal broke in 1993, I lost interest in Jackson but now that he is no longer with us - I hope will be remembered for his music and dancing ability - he was one-of-a-kind. This collection of greatest hits is spectacular! There are couple of Jackson 5 classics and of course the best tracks of his career like Thriller, Billie Jean, Human Nature, The Man in the Mirror, In the Closet, Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), She's Out of My Life, Will You Be There?, and Don't Stop Til You Get Enough. He changed the sound and look of pop music forever, RIP Michael!
B001P9KR8U|3.0|Slumdog Millionaire (Danny Boyle, 2008)<br /><br />It's taken me quite a while since I saw this movie to get around to reviewing it, mostly because I really have no idea how I felt about it. Yes, I was uplifted, blah blah blah, but while I was watching the movie, I realized I was being manipulated, which bothered me. I'm used to needing to suspend disbelief when watching movies, but this one tosses belief right out the window from the first moment and never comes back to it. For all that I know that, however, it's an enjoyable enough movie.<br /><br />In case anyone actually managed to miss the plot of the 2008 Oscar winner for Best Picture, it involves a young man, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), who ends up on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.  As the host asks him questions, we see flashbacks to pieces of his life (amazingly, in chronological order!) that give him the answers. Boyle uses this to take us on a tour of Mumbai slum life, the state of gang warfare in India, a romantic subplot, and much much more.<br /><br />As long as you don't mind being herded into the pen like cattle, or don't notice, this is just about the perfect movie; it took home eight Oscars, and as I write this is sitting at #64 on IMDB's Top 250. Heady stuff indeed, but I still find myself unimpressed with the complete lack of subtlety to be found in the script. Granted, everyone involved did a bang-up job of bringing that script to life, but the script itself left a lot to be desired. It's shameless in everything it tries to do, but it garnered a whole lot of true believers, both behind and in front of the cameras. It had to, for the final product to be as technically fine as it is.<br /><br />Technically, a stunning achievement. Plotwise, not so much. See for yourself and judge. ***
0061124265|5.0|Great book! I thoroughly enjoyed it! The concept of insanity and 'normality' has always been one to intrigue me over the years & I've never read a book that peeled back the layers and exposed the argument with such intellectual finesse and raw idealism and simply and poetically written, such as this! It leaves the reader with much food for thought as Coelho is famous for. The ideas of pleasure, custom, love and life... amazing!!!

B000WCBPOG|5.0|The Beatles are my favorite band of all times. The movie was wonderful and one of rear musicals that is not just singing and dancing. Some of the singers are even better than John, Paul, George or Ringo and the remakes of some songs better than originals.

B001K3JF7K|3.0|I pre-ordered this because I like Diana Krall's husky smooth jazz style and the fact that the playlist fesatured a lot of bossa nova classics from the 60's that have been neglected except for \\"The Girl from Ipanema.\\"  The arrangements all sound alike, the tempos all sound alike and the only way I can stand to listen to this disc is one cut at a time.  Diana used to sizzle and pop - not here.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I watched about 40 minutes and couldn't finish the movie. The premise of the movie sounded really interesting and refreshingly new from all the Jane Austen book remakes, so I borrowed this from a friend. I'm really glad now I didn't buy or rent it!  The thing I found most disappointing (and revolting) is this idea that movie-makers seem to have that they must introduce sexual vulgarity in order to make a historical movie interesting. This movie reminded me a lot of the \\"Mansfield Park\\" movie (1999), which introduced slavery and rape--that's NOT in the book! In \\"Lost in Austen\\" I was disgusted when learning about Mr. Collins' habits. And when Jane starts to show partiality to him, I turned off the movie.  The other thing that was disappointing was the blind credulity of the Bennett family and others of Amanda's modern language, manners and clothing. Her modern clothes are \\"otter-hunting\\" garb?!?   Part of the appeal of the book, for me, was Elizabeth's ability to overcome the social blunders of her family and help Mr. Darcy to see her as she truly was. Amanda's crudeness should have had her shunned from good society of the Austen era.
B000VZVT5Y|2.0|This isn't the real deal.  Looking at the price, in retrospect, I should have realized before I ordered it that, as we've heard before, \\"If it sounds too good to be true...\\"    In the book's introduction it says: \\"...chord shapes have been simplified whenever possible...\\" \\"...The Beatles made frequent use of barre chords...easier shapes have sometimes been substituted\\".  This band had three phenomenally talented and creative guitarists, and their voicings have been completely ignored in favor of first-position \\"cowboy chords\\".     If that's what you want, go for it.  Most of the changes are correct, and a really advanced guitarist with a good ear could figure out the inversions, extensions and voicings pretty well for him/herself.  If you know a little bit about Beatle tunes and the guitar, this book might reinforce what you already know, but if you're past that stage, give this book a pass.    I guess this is one place where a visit to a brick and mortar bookstore or music store might have been advisable, to actually look inside the book at the chord charts.    Certainly someone has transcribed the chord voicings more closely to the originals.  I'm going to keep looking.

B001F0RA4S|4.0|This is the ultimate homage one writer can give to another. It is the story of three women united across time and space by one powerful novel: Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf. The characters, who are all profoundly touched in some way by the novel, are rendered in such exquisite, loving detail that the reader's life in turn becomes entwined with theirs.<br /><br />Woolf herself is one of the main characters, just beginning to write Mrs. D while dealing with the repercussions of what today would probably be diagnosed as bipolar disorder. Mrs. Brown is reading the novel in post-World War II Los Angeles, a where where she feels completely out of place, unfulfilled and trapped. And in the present day, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\"-as she is nicknamed by her oldest friend-bustles through the day preparing for a party she is giving in her dying friend's honor (another author).<br /><br />Following the same structure as Mrs. D, the novel spans only one pivotal day in the life of each woman, a day that seems like a microcosm of their entire lives. And as their stories unfold, we gradually learn that all three women are more closely linked than it seemed at first--indeed, their lives are inextricable entwined with one another's.

B00005JNJV|5.0|That's a typical prequel. After a certain number of films about and with Batman and his adventures, the saga felt the need to have an origin, a beginning, and a prequel came out of the box. This prequel really has all the necessary qualities to make it interesting, plus a few extra kicks. Of course the childhood of the dear Bruce. He fell into a well, which was not a well but it looked like one and he frightened thousands of bats who attacked him on their way to some escape. That's his fear. Then he is the witness of the double assassination, or murder, of his father and his mother, and then we jump to his young age when he runs around the world and ends up in some Tibetan ninja-monk-hostel where he meets with some crazy guru who wants to make the world right by killing everyone in Gotham as an example to the world. Our Bruce refuses and comes back to Gotham and tries to set things right, to set crime right, to bring criminals to court and to have them severely convicted and sentenced. It's when the guru comes back and tries to put his plan in action. Batman will stop him of course, and at the same time he will settle his family business right by re-buying the shares of it and taking the control of it directly. Plus a crazy doctor, or mad doctor if you prefer, plus his girl friend from far away, Rachel, and a little bit of sentimental honey. You have it right. It must work if you create fear and panic. As for that the film is superb and the special effects are so special they nearly look natural though abnormal. Of course the formula is not new. I could quote films and books with the same elements, maybe not all at the same time in one book or one film, but all in Stephen King, Anne Rice and many others. The lessons that are behind that story is that you cannot make people happy if they don't want to be; that you cannot trust any unregulated free market economy because there are also some human beings who will negotiate all obstacles to make a bigger profit, and embezzling and corruption will bring the system down; that there is no justice if there is not a court, a trial, a conviction, a sentence, and the possibility of parole; that people need a dream, a symbol, a vision to be set on the right road and to stay on it. And a few other goodies, if you read between the lines and behind the punctuation. Quite great fun all together and if you don't like the philosophy, you can always get detached and fly to some kind of nirvana, even if it is artificial.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDezzling and corruption will bring the system down; that there is no justice if there is not a court, a trial, a conviction, a sentence, and the possibility of parole; that people need a dream, a symbol, a vision to be set on the right road and to stay on it.

0439882826|1.0|I am baffled there are this many positive reviews for this product.  Either you are allowing your passion for Star Wars blind you or you have placed your book in a special quiet place and look at it from afar.  I am only comforted by the fact my mother bought this book for my son, or I would be demanding my money back.<br /><br />My mother saw this online will searching for another Star Wars product and my son and I were both excited when it came.  Although he is only four, he loves Star Wars and we use it as a way to learn about other things.  This book fell apart the first time we used it.  The middle designs in particular are hard to compact, making the book impossible to put away or even get to other pages.  The lightsabers go on and off when they want to...or maybe when you use the force.<br /><br />Listen, I'm an educated man with a calm mind and a passion for Lucas products.  I have actually thrown this book away because I was so tired of trying to make something poorly designed cherished just because it is a Star Wars Product.  I find it hard to believe of the hundreds of reviews there are no other complaints.<br /><br />Save your money and buy other products with the same information.
B0028NSE3M|5.0|After several years as a staff arranger, producer, writer and instrumentalist for Stax Records, Hayes cut his 1967 solo debut, [[ASIN:B000000ZMF Presenting Isaac Hayes]], sketching an album template that was rendered in ink on this 1969 follow-up. Where the debut riffed on tunes by Willie Dixon and Count Basie, this sophomore effort offers full-length dissertations. With only four tracks, but a running time of over 45-minutes, Hayes stretched covers of Bacharach and David's \\"Walk On By\\" and Jimmy Webb's \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\\" to epic length. The single versions, added here as bonus tracks, still clock in at 4:33 and 6:57, respectively, even when edited to their radio essentials.<br /><br />Hayes didn't just lengthen these songs by adding musical jams and verbal recitations; he refashioned them completely into soul music, with thumping drum beats, deep bass, and wailing psychedelic guitars. His deeply pained vocal on \\"Walk On By\\" is as much sung as it is begged, and an 8-minute rap blossoms brilliantly into an emotional reading of \\"By the Time I Get to Phoenix.\\" These covers didn't just separate themselves from earlier versions, they separated themselves from everything else then being recorded in soul music.<br /><br />The album's new pieces include the heavy soul \\"Hyperbolicsyllablecseseuedalymistic,\\" featuring a terrifically funky piano solo, and a standard ballad arrangement of Charles Chalmers' \\"One Woman.\\" Interestingly, Hot Buttered Soul, wasn't recorded in the famed Stax studio, but at the nearby Ardent complex that regularly hosted overflow Stax work and was the home turf of Big Star. Clearly there was magic in those rooms. This latest reissue includes 24-bit remastering by Bob Fisher and a 12-panel booklet with introductory notes by Jim James, liners by Bill Dahl and a couple of great photos.

B0013D6LEM|5.0|This album is pure genius.  I listen to Human Nature every day.  I remember blasting it out of my friend's Bose speakers while driving around in college.  Oh, how I'm going to miss him.  I was so looking forward to his tour and his new music.
0593054253|5.0|excellant book with beautiful photos and drawings. Makes you want to see the art in person.
B001DHXT1G|1.0|Let me keep this simple.  I watched this film because my  friends LOVE this movie.  Come to think of it, if you give my friends a 'box of staples' and  a six pack of cheap beer, they'll stay amused for hours.  Need I say more?
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  A true story that's a must see movie.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|Another entertaining movie by Clint Eastwood. He was great as the  opinionated, grumpy old man with old school ideas that didn't put up with other people's bull. While his own children and grandchildren were ready to send him to a retirement home and wait for their inheritance,the family next door found value in him other than just monetary and as a result an unexpected friendship. Entertaining from start to finish.
B001ED7C58|5.0|The first time through, I thought the soundtrack was a little loud, but by the third time through, I was in love with every song!  Rob's song is AWESOME (and definitely not loud)! And so many of the songs have words that are perfect for the movie.  I highly recommend this soundtrack for all 'Twilight' fans!
B0026NWBY2|5.0|George Harrison is one of the most underrated musicians of all time. This is the first guy who really mixed East and West and made extremely popular music out of it. This is the source of the Beatles' Indian influence. Without George I bet yoga wouldn't even be as popular today in the West. The were other people who wanted to bring Eastern culture to the West, but none of them were anywhere near as big or influential as George and The Beatles.    Whereas Paul gets plenty of airtime, John a decent amount (though less than he deserves - playing \\"Imagine\\" over and over is an insult to him and all the other great songs he did after The Beatles), George gets stuck under the radar. This was a guy who talked plenty and was extremely witty and funny and yet was called \\"stern George\\" and \\"the quiet one\\" simply because he didn't smile all the time like Ringo or Paul, and didn't invite controversy like John. Some would say he was the best looking Beatle (hard to argue that looking at the CD cover), but Paul still got all the attention on that front because George never liked to hog the spotlight and wasn't big on the idea of celebrity. He was the leader of the best supergroup of all time, The Traveling Wilburys - but how many people remember that? When they think George Harrison they think \\"lead guitarist of the Beatles\\" - he was so much more than that...    I think with CD's like this and the upcoming Scorcese documentary, more people will realize what they've been overlooking. Paul and John both had outstanding solo careers, but George's was right there with them - often he even surpassed them. Hell, he even surpassed him at one point when they were still a band. Abbey Road was, in my opinion, the best Beatles album, and George had, in my opinion, the two best songs on that album (\\"Something\\" - Sinatra's favorite song, and \\"Here Comes The Sun\\"). Like John who sadly didn't have much time to accumulate his great solo work, George also had many other interests and spent years and years away from music. The relatively little that he did record was some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard.     I like some of the song choices here - \\"Let It Roll\\" is one of my favorite songs from All Things Must Pass and I doubt very many people have heard or remember that song. I listen to it all the time and it makes my mind wander, it's such a rich yet simple song. \\"I Don't Want To Do It\\" is a choice only someone who really knows George's work would pick, I bet even most George fans have never heard of it. However, \\"Marwa Blues\\" is just an instrumental - one that is a great example of why George was the best slide guitar player of all time - but \\"Cheer Down\\" is also an example of that, so instead of an instrumental why not get a song on there like \\"Fish On The Sand\\" or \\"Don't Let Me Wait Too Long\\" or \\"You\\" or \\"I Live For You\\" or \\"Life Itself\\" or...?     There are so many great George songs, they should have just done a box set of CD's. Hopefully this CD will sell well and stay where it is at the top of the Amazon charts, and they will be encouraged to release more.

1595141715|5.0|Ok so i am a 14yr old girl and let me tell u im not the type to read. i found this book out by one of my friends and she said i just HAD to read it. so being the good friend i am i gave this book a shot. it was so amazing!i couldnt help but to find tears streaming down my eyes even though it was my 3rd time reading it. its a touching, beautiful, funny, unforgetable teen book. READ IT!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I wasn't sure about a musical, but with Joss Whedon, Nathan Fillion and Neil Patrick Harris, I had to give it a try.  I'm glad I did! I loved the characters, the music was fun and the story was great.  I love the attempt to engage a new business model in delivering movie entertainment without the traditional studio model.  My only criticism (and it's mild) was the ending.  While I like that Joss didn't go with the obvious \\"boy gets the girl\\", the brief sadness of the ending seemed a little out of tune with the rest of the film.
B002BNKQDK|5.0|Watchmen is great movie, dark, stronger, original, is not seems to heros movies like  x men, daredevil, hulk... is a bad guy movie with violence and sexe.  znyder make an epic movie with an apocalyptic vision
0307266303|5.0|I gave up running five years ago.  I'm back at it thanks to Born to Run, a real shot in the arm.  I hope more Americans start to understand how important it is for health and get out and get in the groove.  No excuses, it's fun.  It's made me a better hiker.  I've passed it on to my nieces and nephews.
0810979772|5.0|My 6 yr. old (almost 7) is reading and writing on his own with this book.  I bought this as a more creative activity book for a long car trip.  He had a pen in hand writing answers to the questions 5 minutes after opening the book.  I love it. I'm sure he will be drawing pictures as well. Thank you Jeff Kinney. My child is engaged with a smile while keeping his skills up over the summer!
B001ED7C58|4.0|I've not heard of many (almost all) of these bands before and was pleasantly surprised to find that I like every song on this CD.  Some more than others.
B000Y179KO|5.0|The Eagles are the greatest band ever for my money. Lyrics, music ...all superb. This album is as good, or better, than anything they have released before...incredible allusions, provocotive and poignant, witty, sad and joyous..this album has it all plus soaring evocotive instrumentation... And it all sounds even BETTER live....awesome!    I can't wait for the follow up
B0024DF9MU|5.0|I fell in love with this movie from the start my favorite couple is Gigi and Alex they made the movie what it was and i thought they were really adorable together.<br /><br />Overall I loved this movie and it is now on my list as one of my favorite movies of all time.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Boogie Street and Alexandra Leaving are especially haunting, but I love the whole album. You might think to skip it because it is not a solo album, it's a collaboration with Sharon Robinson. Don't skip it. It's great.
B001HBX91S|3.0|This BD delivers excellent images and excellent sound. Some chapters are among the bests of the operas/ballets from which they are picked: the Gypsy Chorus from Trovatore, Habanera from Carmen. Others are just OK. But, for the cost, I would have given it 4 stars... if all the chapters played well!    But they did not! The first 4 chapters played fine, the last 3 played fine, but on the mid 6 chapters my player tried and tried and barely managed to produce some disjoint pictures (good quality stills - but just stills!) and no sound.    Clearly the disk was defective - as my player is a two-months-old Samsung BD-P1600 that has been working fine with several BDs since it arrived, not rejecting a single one. Defective disk, in spite of not showing any sign of scratch on its surface.    Surely you would say \\"return the disk for a refund and buy another one\\". Easier said than done... as I live in Brazil and the cost of shipping to here equals the cost of the disk. So I'd rather keep it as is, instead of discussing with Amazon for a refund of the price paid and of the shipping costs to here and back to the US.    If you live outside the US, think twice before ordering this BD, as you may be unlucky as I was. Or consider if just playing, let's say, 50% of it, it would still be worthy for you...
B000JMK6LC|4.0|This is an awesome movie. I recommend it. This movie is made even better if seen in high definition. I gotta say I love the HD revolution. It's almost as good as being in a theater.
0385341008|5.0|I had neard good things about this book and ordered it, was surprised to find it in the form of letters and started it with some misgivings - I was immediately drawn into the charm of the story.  The characters were all very human, believable and likeable.  My knowledge of WW2 had taught me about the occupation of the Channel Islands but not what they had endured, this brought it all very much down to earth.  The story progresses in a comfortable way, and the outcome is expected - in an unexpected way.<br />A great story about good people.
B00278U1WA|4.0|I have to hand it to Regina Spektor -- she actually has managed to refine and further her unique anti-folk/pop sound, but also keep the unique qualities of her older style. Her third studio album \\"Far\\" is all about this -- lots of multifaceted, fluid expanses of piano, weird little songs about computers made of macaroni, and a quirky little voice. It's a more polished piece of work, but still has the twists and edges to keep it interesting.<br /><br />\\"We sat there looking at the faces/Of these stranges in the pages/'Til we knew 'em mathematically,\\" Spektor says over a powerful, bouncing piano melody. She sings of creating pasta computers that \\"counted up our feelings/And divided them up even/And it called that calculation perfect love\\" and cutting out their own little pebble-hearts that they \\"struck 'em so hard/So hard/Until they sparked.\\"<br /><br />Well, it's nice to see that she isn't writing your average MTV goopy love-ballad about kissing.<br /><br />It's followed up by a wistful little ballad with a title like a hiccup (\\"Eeeee-eeeeee-eeeeet!\\") , a horn-and-synth-riddled pop melody that bounces and swirls alternately, a stompy piano-rockers, mellow slower songs, soaring ballads about the ultimate prize (\\"Human, human of the year, you are\\"), a dance song or two, sprightly sunny pop melodies, a pair of rambling anti-folky songs.<br /><br />It's nice to see that greater exposure hasn't taken away the weird from Regina Spektor's work. Rather than your usual silly love songs and personal laments, she tackles the loss of familiar things, God's sense of humor, a society full of chipper automatons (\\"They started out beneath the knowledge tree/Then they chopped it down to make white picket fences\\") and a 1984-esque story about being \\"hooked into machine.\\" When it's not bizarre, she inserts little quirks and strange images that stick in your mind (\\"Blue lips, blue veins/The color of our planet from far away\\").<br /><br />She also has become more polished musically, with everything a bit smoother and nimbler than before. Her piano is still the centerpiece -- it jabs, flows, bounces, ripples and elegantly twists -- and it's accompanied by the occasional swirl of synth, some horns, and plenty of subtle drumming. Listen carefully and you can hear a bit of violin in songs like \\"Laughing With,\\" and some tambourine in \\"Blue Lips,\\" just enough to flavor their sounds.<br /><br />The song that doesn't fit in is \\"Dance Anthem of the 80s,\\" which sounds like a token dance song, which tries to fuse anti-pop and dance. It doesn't quite work. The jabby jangling \\"Machine\\" (with its eerie synth and jingling chains) doesn't entirely fit either, but taken alone it's a brutally memorable song.<br /><br />Well, enough of that. Spektor's slightly creaky vocals weave easily between clear high sweetness and quirky murmurs, and she's got a special knack for evoking a slightly magical, bittersweet worldview -- genies, a genial deity, love games, balloons, a lake that turns \\"thick as butter,\\" and rainy streets. Lots of delightfully odd phrases (\\"and the pride inside their eyes/is synchronised to a love you'll never know\\") and images (sparks flying from a pair of pebble-hearts).<br /><br />The special edition comes with a DVD with some extra music videos -- the surreal Escheresque \\"Laughing With,\\" a frolic on a suburban frontyard in \\"Dance Anthem of the 80s,\\" a soft-focused and elegant \\"Eet,\\" and the black-and-white images of her face shot through a giant lens, surrounded by strange mirrors, snowglobes and contorted shapes.

0312360266|1.0|This series is stupid and pointless. Half the time I forgot about the kids being vampires. It seemed the ONLY reason they were vampires was to introduce sex or sexuality into the scene. The detail of vampires seemed more like hair color than anything else.    I have big problems with the world in this book. I am sorry, but history has proven that a superior race or tribe or group of people will rule another. I can't see these supposed strong vampires being ringed in and harassed. Co-existance seems utterly out of question.    I have big problems with the characters. The brainy Dameon (or whatever) speaks like an idiot. His big words are only \\"big\\" if you've all the smarts of a first grader. All the conversation is stilted and doesn't work.    Zoey, I have the biggest problem with. These authors consistantly break their own rules. You can have a powerful character and still FOLLOW your rules. If YOU SAY no fledgling can be marked thus, then FOLLOW your own RULES! She's perfect in every way. The most power, the most beautiful, the most everything! She's good and wise and picked on by everything and one! She's SO cookie cutter Mary Sue it isn't funny. ==;    The pace of the book is unrealistic. To go from no training/ freshly marked to most powerful priestess in all time in two months? Ah, that just bespeaks of those late night infomercials promising the world for 15 low-low-low payments of $19.95.    I can't understand how an english teacher could write such crap. Does she not read the books she teaches? Does nothing break through?
B000003TSP|4.0|Consider my rating 3 1/2 stars.    Maybe they got a little to latched onto this style.  This is often a problem with bands whose style is very unique.  While the first disc pops with originality, the inability to really push beyond that style in subsequent releases will cause many fans to move on and be happy with the first release.  Often the only way for bands with such a unique style, like Portishead, to have long term success is to have long periods between releases so that a new generation discovers their sound and sounds fresh to old fans.  If you have the first Portishead you can probably skip this one or download a few of your favorites.
B0020MMB9E|4.0|If you are a foodie and love to read cook books you will enjoy this one. I like the fact that Jamie belives that cooking is not an exact science and that there is lots of room in his recipes for personal interpretation and food likes and dislikes. Go out there and have some fun and cook for the ones you love.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I purchased this Star Trek Collection of movies, and I love it, Blu-ray makes it even better! If your a trek fan then you'll love this.  I thought it was a great price (I had a 25 dollar gift certificate at the time so I got it for under $45 with shipping and handling,yay!), It didn't take too long with shipping either, overall I'm just glad I've added this to my movie collections, can't wait for the new Star Trek movie to come out to complete the set!
B0000025RI|5.0|In wake of his death and living in the middle of nowhere the only way many of us can honor Michael is to buy his albums. I was born in 1982 and grew up listening to Michael Jackson. It was the some of the first music that had rang through my ears and I am thankful for that. Without him the music industry would not be the same as it is today. He revolutionized modern dance and influenced most of today's music artists. There will never be another artist like him. Truly a legend among all of those who came after him. There is a reason why this album is the most sold all over the world. It's is a must have.

0765348276|3.0|I'd have to give this one 3 stars.  It's a very fast-paced page turner, and not overly long (possibly even too short given the scope of it).  It's an entertaining book but there were certain things about it that made me wonder about all the 4- and 5-star reviews.  I haven't read much Heinlein or Haldeman, so maybe part of the problem is that I don't have any warm and fuzzy memories of the types of books that this one is clearly an ode to.  I just couldn't quite get into the tone of it- it's too serious for satire, but too over-the-top and comical (sometimes intentionally, sometimes not) to take seriously.  Still, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for light and fun beach reading.    *** Spoilers ***    The inch-high aliens were the point where it really went too far for me.  I mean, it's science fiction and all, but if I'm not reading pure fantasy or pure comedy then I have to be able to maintain SOME suspension of disbelief.  This was so clearly not rooted in anything resembling reality that it just took the whole book down a notch for me.    The universe in general isn't believable at all, particularly the aliens.  The different alien races almost seemed like the sorts of things a 5-year-old would make up.  The political situation wasn't very credible either- all of these different races, at roughly the same level of technology, in a mad scramble to colonize as much of the galaxy as possible.  I just can't buy it.  Also, the idea that people living on Earth are kept in a self-imposed quarantine (while still being subject to the Colonial government) just doesn't make sense.    The jokey dialogue was mostly corny (sometimes to the point of being really irritating when it went on too long).  It's actually refreshing to have characters that don't wallow in self-pity and are good at sucking it up and soldiering on when bad things happen, but it would be lot more entertaining (and less annoying) if they had a much better sense of humor.  Jokey dialogue works better whenit's funny.    Also, it was weird that he seemed to be drawn towards Jane, whereas I think most people in the same situation would be creeped out and disturbed by the experience of meeting their dead wife's clone (or whatever), with none of the memories or personality.  It wasn't even something he had mixed feelings about.    Maybe I just had the wrong expectations going into it, or didn't have enough familiarity with the other books that inspired it, but I just can't see giving this one more than 3 stars and really don't get the 5-star ratings and awards.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This is an excelent series and i can not wait for the next one and if they keep close to the books it will be a brilliant set.
1402210086|3.0|This book is set in the early 19th century England, specifically London. The main character, Kitty Charling is put in a predicament by her adoptive father. She is to inherit his fortune, but only if she marries one of his nephews of her choosing. Her choice seems to be Jack, for she has had feelings for him, but he has not offered for her. In order to get to London her and another nephew, Freddy say they are engaged, but she has another plan in works.<br /><br />This is my first experience with this type of novel. The writing is witty, quick, and mostly dialogue. I liked the quick pace and the charming story. It's a very light-hearted and easy read, and it will definitely make you feel good.<br /><br />The problems I had with it were some of the dialogues and how they were written; they just weren't in the style that I liked. I felt some of the characters spoke in odd ways and some parts of the novel were boring.<br /><br />But I recognize this would be a great and fun read for people who like this type of novel. In this case I do recommend it. But if you're like me, and like more traditional or regular style of book, then you might not enjoy the story enough to overlook the style.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I enjoyed the series, just wish I had HBO to catch the new shows. Still liked Moonlight better though. Mick and Beth had better chemistry but True Blood has some interesting characters as well. Sam is one. It was worth buying. I'll probably get the second season when it comes out.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Once again, with the new blu-ray version of Advent Children, Square Enix has out-done themselves again.  The animation is absolutely beautiful, and the special features are just as amazing.    For any FF fans, with a blu-ray player or ps3, this is a must buy.    5 stars.
0060555661|5.0|the book is quite old and as such some of the information is dated.  Furthermore, the book is outrageously conservative.  That being said, it provides sound investment principes and points out erroneous investment strategies.  The book should be read by all serious investors for it is the best book on conservative investing that I am aware of.  And thus should be read even if one opts for a less conservative path.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|Before this album I was only a mild fan of Slipknot. A friend of mine bought me this and said I had to listen to all of it. I was amazed! I was so impressed I went to my first Slipknot Concert this past May and was blown away even more. These guys are amazing and even better live. After the concert I had to buy all the other albums. Let me say that I love all of their albums so I recommend to just buy them all if you haven't already. This one stood out though. Yes a good few of these songs are slower and not as heavy as one would expect but they show off Cory Taylor's range with his voice and after listening two or three times. I find myself enjoying those slower songs as much as Psychosocail. It might be a new direction for the band and I hope they keep the heavy thrash that they have always had, but I still enjoyed this album. To every slipknot fan, I say buy it and give it at least 2 listens before you reserve judgment. and for those like I was who only liked one or two songs before. This is worth the purchase, and if it doesn't make you a fan check your pulse.    However, just to make you aware before you buy, the DVD is nothing special. It is about a half hour of just random behind the scenes stuff that looks like it was shot by different band members, but I always have to buy the special edition. So if you can live without it, I would just buy the album.
1416914307|4.0|I absolutely loved this series!! It was definetely something else!! I refused to believe that Jace & Clary were siblings from the very beginning!! It was so heartbreaking when they loved each other so much & were forced apart because of a lie... just powerful. MORE powerful than when they actually got together... YET at the end of the book.. It drove me crazy!! when Clary remembers what the witch had told Jace... that he would fall in love with the wrong person. It was like WHY did she say it. She was a crazy evil witch but... why??  It was probably that the fairy queen wanted her to doubt.. but still driving me crazy.     I do agree with some reviewers that actually knowing who Clary-is is hard to decipher. I never felt close to Clary; it was all about Jace's pain that he couldn't be with her. I felt Jace's emotions and who he was through Clary but never actually who Clary was.  Strange.  Besides that it's AWESOME! I do recommend it!
B0024F08RO|5.0|I have watched this show from the beginning with great interest and pleasure and I will treasure all four PB seasons for the rest of my life. Prison Break boasts of an extremely unusual and clever story line and the plot unravels with great suspense. I really enjoyed this TV show, and I am at a loss as to why it has come to a closure so quickly. Nothing compares to this great show and I hope the producer and the cast (especially the two brothers) will go on to make more new shows.
B00275EGWO|4.0|A war film unlike any other, The Hurt Locker examines a group of Army bomb squad soldiers in Iraq and the extreme toll the horrors of war and the debilitating awareness of imminent death takes on their lives. Incredibly suspenseful from the start, the pressure and paranoia to get the job done never lets up, and though the balance between realism and personalized fiction seems to shift more towards the latter further into the turmoil, few films can boast war scenes of such a gloriously intense magnitude.<br /><br />After the leader of an Army bomb squad unit in Iraq is tragically killed, brash-but-experienced bomb technician William James (Jeremy Renner) is brought in to replace his command. His new squad includes Sergeant JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty); the trio must learn to trust each other through their various, always perilous missions, constantly coping with the daily reminders of the fragility of human life and the infinite dangers surrounding their every move.<br /><br />\\"War is a drug\\" states the opening quote by author Chris Hedges. That idea isn't fully revisited until the conclusion when The Hurt Locker resorts to being a mouthpiece for soldier's mentalities, the regimentation of their lives and their inability to reinsert themselves back into the world they knew before. It seems an unnecessary effort, considering the incredible amount of raw suspense and nail-biting action that drives the majority of the film. It's a small dose of political agenda, leaving the rest to be solidly entertaining, proving once again that director Kathryn Bigelow can handle action movies like the best of them.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is partly a biopic of a fictionalized EOD specialist, and part pseudo-documentary about a tension-wrought Bravo Company 40 day rotation. Instead of focusing on a story arc that separates specific villains and related events, the film chronicles several unrelated bomb missions and the tolls they have on fellow soldiers, Iraqi citizens and James' beliefs and methodology. Without catching those responsible or even hunting specific terrorists, The Hurt Locker relies on tremendously powerful imagery, adrenaline-fix recklessness, mental stresses and an obsession with death, heart-stopping explosions, camaraderie, Full Metal Jacket-influenced commanding officer execution thoughts, and enough suspenseful intensity to level a movie theater. It's borderline humorous the way Bigelow toys with the audience, setting up extreme anticipation for the next detonation or ambush, pouncing on the viewer's senses like a horror film.<br /><br />Being a bomb squad technician is like a roll of the dice, a high-pressure, high-stakes risk that demands a sound mind and a dizzyingly calm intelligence. There is no room for error, and actor Jeremy Renner provides a believable hero - one who demonstrates a daredevil disregard for protocol and safety that might just be a mask for a man whose perfectly-honed skills are the mark of an uncompromising professional. The supporting cast is superb, as are the sound effects and numbingly immersive camerawork. Witnessing a different side of the Iraqi war zone, a modern battlefield, coupled with real-life sacrifice and heroism is powerful, alluring, and eye-opening entertainment.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinscitizens and James' beliefs and methodology.

Calmly and steadily, the right words describing the important aspects of life and career of one of the few astronauts who went twice to the Moon. In the description of the EVA on Gemini 9 mission, we are almost out of breath while reading about the problems Cernan had.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Love him or hate him, every American should see this movie. I loved Roger & Me back in the day, so I have seen every Michael Moore movie at one time or another. He usually goes a little overboard but his movies always open my eyes to new perspectives. With health care reform on the horizon, every American citizen owes it to themselves to be well informed, no matter which side of the debate you are on, and this movie brings critical information from the perspective of people living in the health care systems of many different countries, including the US. Somewhat entertaining, very imformative.

B00005QGAT|5.0|Michael will continue being a great artist, many grew up listening to his music, the influence of many artists and many people in several ways, idol of many generations, victim of its own and the media too, my respects to one of the most talented and amazing artists of all time, R.I.P, is so sad but someone also decided, God maybe, well GOODBYE MICHAEL, you always be one of the greatest.<br />In this simple and humble personal tribute to Michael, I want to express my deepest feelings.<br />My favorite Michael Jackson's album is and always will be \\"OFF THE WALL\\", an impeccable production by Quincy Jones, wonderful musical arrangements, full of energy and emotion, This album opened the door to Michael Jackson in his solo career, the construction of this album is incredible, musically speaking, Horns, strings, electric guitar, and real drums are among the various instruments forming the sonic template for nearly the entire album, As good as the music is, it's Michael's performance that truly elevates the pop here from good to excellent. There's an irresistible charm that Jackson exudes almost every second that he's singing, and a bare minimum of one great hook to be found in each song.<br /><br />1.Don't Stop Till You Get Enough... dance until you fall to the floor<br /><br />2.Rock With You... always will be my preferred song of Michael, many beautiful memories come to my mind with this song<br /><br />3.Working Day And Night... excellent keep dancing<br /><br />4.Get On The Floor...

Most American women take our rights for granted.  It is very eye opening to realize how far women's rights in America have come.  We are proud of the women in our own history who opened the door to vote, to work, to become doctors, lawyers, etc, yet there are still parts of the world where women are no more than \\"pets\\", not even allowed to show their face.  We have soooo much to be thankful for!    I absolutely loved the characters and the book.  I can't wait for Khaled Hosseini's next book!!!!
B000W91RUG|5.0|Focusing on the lives of physicists, and geeky ones at that, does make for an atypical television series, but a great cast, original characters, and high quality writing, combine to produce a modern comedic gem.  Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, it understandably took a little while for the creative team to develop the personalities of the characters.  But once the basic parameters were set, The Big Bang Theory began to boldly go where no comedy has gone before.<br /><br />With characters that always seem to be evolving, the series explores some unusual topics, and frequently heads into uncharted territory, usually making it impossible to predict what may happen.  This is one of the main reasons why this unique, goofy, show is so hilarious and captivating.  The creative team taps into facets of pop culture that may be associated with geeks and nerds (and teenage boys in general), and find ways to weave them into their stories, often in an exaggerated way.  Science fiction, comic books, superheroes, video games, television, action figures, paint ball fights, Star Wars, and the Star Trek universe, are just a few of the subjects that are featured.<br /><br />The cast is marvelous, with Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hofstadter, the shy guy enchanted by his new neighbor.  Jim Parsons is Sheldon Cooper.  If you look up the word neurotic, Sheldon's photo just might be there.  Simon Helberg is Howard Wolowitz, the delusional sleaze, who does still have his good points.  Kunal Nayyar is Rajesh Koothrappali, who can't speak to a beautiful woman unless he is under the influence of alcohol.  Kaley Cuoco is Penny, the girl from Omaha who moved next door, works at the Cheesecake Factory . . . . and changed their universe.<br /><br />Since Sheldon is off the scale when it comes to weirdness (what Penny would later come to describe as `whackadoodle'), and Wolowitz and Raj are arguably more `abnormal', Leonard seems the most sensible of the bunch.  Sheldon is totally unique, so bizarre in his beliefs, behavior and speech, that he seems at times to be from another planet.  Jim Parsons is a amazing comic talent, with a bright, bright future.<br /><br />Penny has a multi-faceted role.  One is as the primary female character, another is that she usually represents as close to a 'normal' persons' point of view as we will get.  As a link to reality, she is often the reference that shows just how wacked out the guys really are.  The times when she joins them in their world (such as when she fragged Sheldon on Halo night), are often some of the program's funniest moments.  By the end of the season, everything about the show is clearly peaking.  In `The Pancake Batter Anomaly', Sheldon gets sick, and Penny gets stuck taking care of him, rubbing Vaporub on his chest, and singing `Soft Kitty'.  In `The Bat Jar Conjecture', it's Sheldon's team versus the rest of the gang and Leslie Winkle (Sara Gilbert), in the Physics Bowl.  Sheldon's knockout of a twin sister arrives and makes waves, in `The Pork Chop Indeterminacy'.  Sheldon gets a look in the mirror, in `The Jerusalem Duality' when a young genius arrives on campus.  In `The Nerduana Annihilation', when Leonard buys the time machine used in the classic 60's film `The Time Machine' on eBay, Penny's  astute description is that `It looks like something that Elton John would drive through the Everglades'.  In the season finale, there's a glimmer of hope for romance for Leonard, in `The Tangerine Factor' when Penny agrees to go out with him.<br /><br />The Big Bang Theory is simply one of the most engaging comedies to come along in years.  Each episode seems to fly by, and leave you wanting more.  Some commentary tracks would have been cool, but the only bonus is the `Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory' a look at the creators, cast, and genesis of the show.  There are only seventeen episodes in the First Season due to the writers' strike.<br /><br />Things only get better in the second season, as the show's creative team continue to develop the characters, and introduce new elements to the mix, keeping things fresh and extremely funny.  As Sheldon Cooper might say, it is a foregone conclusion that the third season will be characterized by the same outstanding writing, and brilliantly quirky humor found in the first two seasons, continuing to keep The Big Bang Theory, at the cutting edge of contemporary comedy.ue to develop the characters, and introduce new elements to the mix, keeping things fresh and extremely funny.

1416550534|5.0|This book shows you a time and place that is no longer available to our generation. This author's description whether it be describing the house, the furniture or the characters - she makes everything so vivid. The twists and turns in it made me stay up till the wee hours reading it. It's been a while since I've come across a book that was almost impossible to put down. I've got Ms. Morton's second novel and I hope it's as good as this one. This is a book like \\"Gone With The Wind\\" or any of Jane Austen's. I will be rereading it. It will be staying in my personal library. Please be sure to read this book, you will not regret it.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|Everything that is old will be made new again.<br /><br />In the age of making the quick buck with inferior bands and even more inferior music, the Godfathers of Heavy Metal have announced their return to the metal realm.<br /><br />2007's \\"Angel of Retribution\\" marked the return of lead vocalist Rob Halford back to the JP fold.  His break from the band stemming from musical differences which forced the band to amicably part ways.<br /><br />Halford would go on to a series of successful groups, (Fight, Halford) and his fan base continued to grow as he kept to his metal roots while the Priest struggled.  After hiring a spot on mimic to take Halford's place, Judas Priest continued on to a dwindling fan base but the soul of the music was gone (as was the songwriting).<br /><br />Fast forward five years since his return and Judas Priest is once again at the forefront of not only heavy metal but the Music Industry.  \\"Nostradamus\\" is epic out taking and one that was years in the making.  \\"Our rich history with metal has covered many of the elements and messages that are both the backbone of his (Nostradamus) life and what we compose; overcoming difficulties; standing up against those that misunderstand what we believe in and many other virtues that attest to what we do with our music,\\" claims the inside cover of the Double CD.  \\"Five hundred years after his passing, Judas Priest undertake what is considered to be our most ambitious musical adventure to date.\\"<br /><br />Ambitious just scratches the surface.  When the first notes rang out from \\"Dawn Of Prophecy\\" I knew I was in store for something special.  Not since \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\" have I heard the classic JP piano that, thank the rock gods, abounds throughout the album as does the fantastic twin guitar work of Downing and Tipton.  With Scott Travis and Ian Hill laying down a solid backbone, Halford's screech \\"I am the darkness...\\" begins an epic journey into the life and death of the future prophit and seer to Kings.<br /><br />The band sounds as tight as it ever has, reaching back to \\"Sad Wings\\" and further for sounds that revolutionized music and metal in general.  The purveyors of the \\"double-lead\\" guitar attack (aka Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing) blaze throughout the album and show even more depth through their use of synthesized guitars.  Young Metal and Hard Rock bands should take note of the feast the Godfathers of Metal  have wrought.<br /><br />In short, if you are or ever have been a Judas Priest fan, it is your  duty to the Metal Gods to go out and purchase this album.  Be prepared for over 90 minutes of metal mayhem and take part in the next evolution of Judas Priest.it ever has, reaching back to \\"Sad Wings\\" and further for sounds that revolutionized music and metal in general.

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I'll keep this short and simple.<br /><br />Regardless of how you feel about MJ as person, no one can deny his influence on pop music. Catchy lyrics, tight beats, stage presence, etc.. He didn't \\"invent\\" these concepts, he just mastered them, and to this day all pop artist owe a little bit of their craft to MJ.<br /><br />That being said, this is a classic album. This was one of the first albums I ever owned. You owe it to yourself to own it too. It's been a while since I spun this CD, but it put a big smile on my face today.

B0014DCT06|3.0|Justin Timberlake's Futuresex/Loveshow was one of the biggest concert events of 2007. HBO Entertainment filmed the concert at Madison Square Garden for broadcast. This DVD capture that broadcast.    If one thing can be said about Timberlake it is that he is willing to take musical chances. He effectively turns the Garden into an intimate club by performing in the round. He also has both dancers and muscians in sync for the almost two hour performance. Something is constantly in motion on stage. As far as the music performed Timberlake gives his audience healthy amounts of his solo material with some older songs thrown into the mix.     The Blu ray DVD presents flawless picture and sound quality. The 90 minute standard definition bonus disc is perhaps just as interesting as the concert DVD. It features backstage footage, an extended interview with Timberlake and the band, and an interesting 1 on 1 segment in which Timberlake explains his song choices and track order for the entire show.

1400096936|5.0|This one's a stunner.<br /><br />The story chronicles America's War on Drugs from every angle: cartels, cops, politicos, priests, prostitutes, mafiosos, triggermen, the works. Spanning more than thirty years, it's incredibly ambitious, thoroughly researched, and completely believable. It's also about as hypnotically entertaining as anything you'll find.<br /><br />But it's more than just a crime story; it's also an exploration of the nature of greed and power, of how the \\"right\\" thing, for a man or a nation, can be almost impossible to understand -- let alone enact.  Highly recommended.

B00110K62U|5.0|Wonderful dvd. The show is a pleasure to watch on TV. I wish they release a blue-ray
B001NESPHC|5.0|I just finished listening to \\"My One and Only Thrill\\", when my cd player eased nicely into the next CD,(probably the most famous jazz album of all time), \\"Kind of Blue\\" by Miles Davis. I wasn't aware of the order, but what a pleasure listening to these two albums on a stifling hot summer's day, with the lights low, and a nice breeze going.     I'd only discovered Melody Gardot a couple of weeks ago, and on the strength of one song, \\"Baby I'm a Fool\\", I ordered this CD. Now, my \\"one and only\\" regret is that I didn't order tickets for her performance at the Toronto Jazz Festival, (in a couple of days), where she'll be performing on the great \\"Harbourfront\\" stage, right beside the cool waters of Lake Ontario, damn it!     Anyway, \\"Baby I'm a Fool\\" kind of reminded me of what Bjork might sound like if she considered doing something in a jazz vein, which ain't a bad prospect! I have to admit that I wasn't crazy about \\"If the Stars were Mine\\", (a tad to easy going), that is, until I heard the \\"orchestrated\\" version at the end of the CD! Those two songs, plus the beautiful title track, and equally beautiful and stirring \\"Our Love is Easy\\" sound gorgeous, embellished with lush strings, as are some of the others. Yet, having said that, I was surprised to hear bluesy, soulful lower register vocals on some of the other blues-type songs, and a great, slow, New Orleans-type funeral march-style piece called \\"Your Heart is as Black as Night\\". Even Melody's laugh, (at the end of \\"Who Will Comfort Me\\"), is delightful and honest- no wonder they left it in! And, if all that weren't enough, let's not forget that she wrote everything except a great, unique version of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\", something that a lot of famous singers don't do. Finally, one more nice touch.... The trombone solo in the (once again, here's that word) \\"beautiful\\" piece, \\"Lover Undercover\\", is one of the most interesting, and original I've ever heard. Consisting of a few very long notes bending gracefully here and there, the player (Andy Martin) sounds as if he's capturing the physical emotions of a human voice, so much so, in fact, that upon first hearing the high part in the middle, I thought it was Melody's voice!       Overall, a great album, excellent production. Continued success Melody!

B0027WNRJ0|4.0|\\"Adrenalize\\",released in 1992, is considered the weak link of the Def Leppard trilogy of Pyromania and Hysteria,because it sounds so much like those previous albums but missing the freshness or novelty.That said,\\"Adrenalize\\" a fine,underrated collection that acts like a bridge between Def Leppard's 80's pop-metal and modern-pop-rock eras.The much-maligned hits \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" and \\"Make Love Like A Man\\" may be heavy on the cheese in the lyrics department,but you can't deny that they're catchy,well-crafted funk-metal numbers.Even better is the dark antidrug epic \\"White Lighting\\",the melodic power ballads \\"Tonight\\",\\"Stand Up(Kick Love Into Motion)\\" and \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\",and the fast-paced rockin closer \\"Tear It Down\\".The second disc contains two numbers with the Irish band Hothouse Flowers(both classic-rock oldies),a great number from the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert \\"Now I'm Here\\" featuring both Queen's Brian May guesting on guitar and Vivian Campbell live debut with Def Leppard,more live numbers of classics(\\"Hysteria\\",\\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\",\\"Photograph\\",\\"Too Late For Love\\"),two versions of \\"Tonight\\"(demo and the Sun Studios cut)and \\"Two Steps Behind\\"(sans strings).The remastered \\"Adrenalize\\"(done by Bob Ludwig)sounds amazing,increasing the midrange and bass making it more special than it was the first time out.If you a Def Leppard fan,you must pick this up.You're gonna love this!

B002AS463W|5.0|I loved this movie, despite all its flaws.I wasn't so much into the content of it, (although that was ok, too) but Mickey Rourke was BREATHTAKING, gorgeous, you can't take your eyes off him when he is on screen. I mean he never looked better, before or since.  Actually, he could just recite the phone book and I would have bought the movie, so as far as a critical analysis, I can only say, its a reasonably good flick to watch at home, big bowl of popcorn, very sexy and romantic in a weird way, some good scenes, well done, especially if you have an '80's nostalgia ( I do )  but you get the feeling that a lot of it had been cut out.  Its worth the trip, just for Mickey!  Oh, and Kim Bassinger was decent, too!
0930289234|4.0|I'm not a comic book person. In fact, this was the first comic book (or is the term 'graphic novel' now?). I had some trouble getting into it, but it was all worth it. The text is scribbly and very difficult to read, random words were bolded for no apparent reason, and the page numbers made no sense. The story itself was hard to get into because I was concentrating on these things, but once it got started, it really got started. I think I got hooked right around the part where Dr. Manhattan's character gets more to do (basically, when it started being slightly more character-centric). The majority of the book is action-centered, but there are some fantastic moments of character development (whole story arcs for several of the characters, giving them psychologically deep stories behind the actions that become crucial to the plot). The two most intriguing characters to me were by far Rorschach and Dr. Manhattan. One with too much to feel, the other with nothing. The minor details the characters were given, such as distinct speech patterns, made all the difference. The end fell apart. Once all the character development was done, it was all action, action, action, and the big reveal at the end made no sense to me. Fantastic set-up with really well-rounded characters, and it all falls flat on its face near the end. The ending could have been handled much better, but it was still an amazing experience, and well-worth the time to get to know all these interesting characters.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5/5
0451217403|5.0|Dare I say it's almost 'fun' to read this incredible piece of material.  Completely familiar with the movie, and having never read this novel before, it was very interesting in comparing the two.  For whatever reason, I do not associate the movie actors with the book characters like I always seem to do with other made-into-movie books, and I'm not too sure why.  In the end, however, it becomes another one of those books that one wishes they had read first before seeing the movie (even as excellent as the movie was).
0307266303|5.0|\\"Born to Run\\"  Book Review    This is a remarkable book if its claims are correct, limited web searches of several names quoted support the claims.  Based on his experiences with the Tarahumara, also known as the running people who live in the Copper Canyon in Mexico, and ultra marathoners, he claims that podiatrists and running shoe manufacturers are guilty of causing harm to runners.  In particular the cushioning of feet in sneakers increases the impact load on the runners skeleton resulting in damage.  For example he claims that 8 out of 10 runners are hurt every year form running.  However the Tarahumara use cut up old car tires and successful ultra marathoners use unpadded shoes, he even claims that bare foot running is good for one.  The evidence is spread over his account of some exciting ultra marathon races which makes the book fascinating and an easy read as he gets his central message out. I would like to hear the expected refutations by the medical establishment.
B000002KDO|4.0|Exploring Black Sabbath in order to answer the question \\"When did heavy metal begin?\\", I think that maybe this album could provide the answer...but the distinctions between heavy metal/hard rock and heavy rock do tend to muddy the waters a bit. Their previous album, \\"Paranoid\\", which is in my opinion their crowning glory, did have songs which definitely were hard (or heavy)rock. Maybe this album crystallises the modern heavy metal sound. If modern heavy metal seems a bridge to far for some, then Black Sabbath definitely pioneered a swampy rock/metal sound here.       In some ways, this album seems to me to try and counter-balance their association with the occult and Satanic themes. The themes dealt in this album are The Big Issues. And this album is the proto-type for their following albums, up until \\"Sabotage\\", which in my opinion is their second best album after \\"Paranoid\\". \\"Master of reality\\" is arguably their third best album, but there's not much in it. The album is prototypical in mixing their brand of metal type rock with quirky and experimental tracks. Perhaps Paranoid's trippy delight in \\"Planet caravan\\" can be seen as having this design too, but I think that Master Of Reality took it a step further, and, besides, Paranoid is atypical in having so many songs ripe for commercial fodder.     Not being a hardcore fan of heavy metal, the songs which I liked best on this album are:    Embryo: one of the shortest tracks in music, probably, at some 28 seconds long. An instrumental featuring the cello. A jaw dropping kind of track to have by a band called \\"Black Sabbath\\"!    Orchid: another instrumental, running at 1:31 seconds. Features what sounds to me like a classical guitar and a double bass, perhaps. With undoubted heavy metal bands like Metallica, you usually hear how they were influenced by bands like Motorhead etc. Not having heard those commonly cited influences on them, it tends to be the Black Sabbath songs where I hear their influences. For example, the intro to this track reminds me of the introduction to Metallica's \\"Fight fire with fire\\" off of their \\"Ride the lightning\\" cd (another song from that album, \\"For whom the bell tolls\\", I think, also sounded to me like it sampled the same bell recording that Black Sabbath used for their debut album's title track).    Lord of this world: has a chunky sounding bass and thumping drums. Also features a driving rhythm...Australian hard rock act Wolfmother's song \\"Woman\\" is reminiscent of this Black Sabbath song, in some ways).    Solitude: a mellow song. Doesn't feature Ozzy Osbourne on vocals, I don't think. Seems to reference, lyrically, Bob Dylan's song \\"With God on our side\\". The guitar sounds lucid on this song and the bass sounds nice. Bells and a horn, I think, are used.    Into the void: a chunky sounding bass again, with an interesting vocal delivery by Ozzy. Has a very heavy rhythm and there is some speed drumming. Along with Sweet Leaf and Children Of The Grave, these songs could be considered heavy metal, I think.     These are the tracks that seemed the best to me, but on second listen, Sweet Leaf's riff was getting planted in my brain. That faded, but perhaps that song could get stuck in your with repeated listens. It features a coughing man at the start (again, Metallica use this device in a song on their under-appreciated classic hard rock album \\"Reload\\", in the song \\"Bad seed\\"). It's basically a love song to the band's drug of choice, marijuana, the subject of the song's title. Features the interesting lyric \\"You introduced me to my mind\\", so the drug is obviously playing the part of Ozzy's muse in this song. The song has a very heavy riff, which sounds sort of synthesisery, and is very insistent. Some bass is noticeable on the song too.    Children of the grave: features bass and a driving rhythm, which may be by a synthesiser. Ozzy tries to be a voice for hope in his lyrics, but, again, some apocalyptic themes emerge, as they have in previous albums...to do with mushroom clouds - an ever present fear at that time (I mean the threat of total human extinction due to a nuclear war between the US and the USSR). A heavy metal type song.    The final song which I haven't covered yet is \\"After forever\\". It's this song which makes me feel that the band are backtracking from their association with the occult. Lyrically, the song seems pro-Christian...maybe you could describe it as the first Christian rock song! The lyrics are sort of a Socratic monologue on theology. Musically, a synthesiser is featured and there is a good, boogie riff, which may be by the synthesiser too. Oddly, parts of this song reminded me of the theme to the tv show \\"Friends\\"! Perhaps this song can be grouped with their song \\"Under the sun\\" from their next album, which would demonstrate, I think, that the band wore theological masks and had as many positions on the existence or otherwise of God as there were band members. In other words, I don't really get the impression that the band could be described as \\"committed\\" to any philosophical position when it came to religion.    Recommendations for this band:    I think that the first three albums pretty much show the band in all its phases. Their debut was sort of folk rock...not a favourite of mine, but I do know that in their home country it is highly regarded. Their second album, Paranoid, is my idea of a greatest hits type album. They never reached those hooky heights again, I don't think.  However, if you want to explore the archetypal Black Sabbath album, Master Of Reality is it. Like their following albums, it is more album orientated rock than hit singles type rock. And if you listen to this album, and the next ones up until Sabotage, I think that you will gain new respect for this band's audacity and courage. Led Zeppelin were never this experimental, but they seem to the band that gets all the kudos. In my opinion, Black Sabbath were the superior and more important band.

B000025192|4.0|This isn't an album I would have come across myself without any help. Talking music on online forums I might have heard one person recommend this album as being great. And some months back I saw it mentioned in a rock magazine. Those two things together made me want to check this album out.        Musically, I find the sound harder than some other albums of the time that I've been exploring, mainly with reference to the origins of heavy metal. So, I'd say that I find the music in this harder than Cream, Jimi Hendrix and the debut albums of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Often the music is what you'd call 'heavy/hard rock'.  If you are familiar with AC/DC's no hits album \\"Powerage\\", it's not a million miles away from that...sort of MC5 doing AC/DC before AC/DC. It's not as catchy as AC/DC's ultimate Australian pub rock album \\"Let there be rock\\", but it's in that kind of territory, or some of Alice Cooper's harder sounding songs. The following year, Australian band The Masters Apprentices released perhaps the heaviest rock song up to that point in time, \\"Turn up your radio\\", which was a killer track.        To the album...it seems to be an entirely live performance, and it does have some strong swear words, occasionally. Some of the pre-song banter by the lead singer makes you think that the band is of African American origin, but looking at the cover art, they seem pretty white to me! Not sure, but maybe the band is playing to a black audience, and showing solidarity with them or something.        Generally consistent in quality, the songs which I liked the best were:    I want you right now: my pick as the best song on this album. It's very heavy rock (perhaps the heaviest sound in music to that point in time...certainly heavier than Black Sabbath's debut album). There is some good multi-vocals happening, and I like the slower tempo part of the song. The song's riff is ball park similar to The Trogg's classic \\"Wild thing\\".     Best of the rest-    Rocket reducer: Reminded me of Australian hard rock band of the 70s-80s The Angels, and their song \\"She keeps no secrets\\", with regard to the guitar sound. The vocals also reminded me of Australian band Gangagang's classic \\"Gimme some lovin'\\". The song has lots of lead guitar histrionics.    Starship: An epic song which runs to 8:15 minutes. It's very heavy rock with a strong riff. It later gets a bit more performance arty, in a trippy kind of way. Lyrically, it's poetic in a The Doors kind of way. Experimental.     The rest -     Ramblin' Rose: has an introduction with evangelical zeal. Becomes heavy rock'n'roll, with fuzzy rhythm guitar and a squealing lead guitar.    Kick out the jams: rock'n'roll song with spanking drums. The song which features a strong swear word, even by today's standards. Chorus is sort of catchy.    Come together: Noise rock. Sort of equivalent to those AC/DC records I mentioned before....Let There Be Rock, and Powerage, with regard to the guitar sound.     Borderline: Has grating guitars, some good rhythm guitar and multi-vocals.    Motor City is burning: Bluesy rock'n'roll with a bassy boogie shuffle and B.B.King type vocals.    If you like the rawness of this record, try AC/DC's Powerage album. If you like the hooks in the songs here, you might enjoy AC/DC's \\"Let there be rock\\" record.
B001W63DXC|4.0|OMG, I am reviewing a Maiden record.<br />This is a great live album. For a band that is cranking out live albums with every world tour, they are not losing a bit of energy. The twist with this album is that it is all classic catalog, and every song was filmed in a different venue. The production is stellar, and the packaging is what I would expect from Iron Maiden Holdings LLP with the exception that Eddie does not grace the cover of this album.<br />Iron Maiden remain one of the greatest metal bands in the history of heavy metal.
B000002J03|4.0|An entirely listenable album which is catchy at times as well, Led Zeppelin provides an album with a song which is still fodder for commercial Australian FM radio stations...    Whole lotta love: a bona fide Led Zeppelin classic. It's features their first classic riff and Robert Plant presents the voice which defines him in this song. This song is perhaps the ultimate '[...] rock' song. Even though I concede that this song is a classic, I'm not sure I entirely enjoy Plant's vocal antics...listening to him, you get the impression that he is rubbing himself against his microphone stand as he sings! Anyway, there is a very good schizophrenic turn to the sound of this song midway.    Whilst no other songs reach the album opener's high standards, I think the following couple of songs are not bad:    Thankyou: has an introduction which reminds me of Boston's \\"More than a feeling\\", so perhaps Boston were inspired, in part, by this song? Features a churchy sounding organ and steel string accoustic guitar. The lyrics are self-consciously romantic, perhaps in a tongue in cheek kind of way. Plant occasionally has a very nice vocal melody in this song.     Bring it on home: book-ended with a nice, genteel bluesy sound, and a T-Rexy boogie shuffle on guitar, Plant pretends to be a black American or something of the sort! Also featuring the harmonica, the song veers into more rock territory in the middle, with jarring electric guitars and the quality of sound seems to be the signature sound that the band would later develop. Haven't looked into how that odd sounding guitar sound was achieved, but it sounds like a synthesiser riff.     The rest:    What is and what should never be: has a nice, jazzy, laid back part, as well as a rock part.    The lemon song: groovy bass, some screaming lead vocals and galloping drums, and features the lyrics \\"Squeeze me baby, 'til the juice runs down my leg\\". As a long time AC/DC fan, it galls me to have Led Zeppelin revered as rock gods, but if AC/DC wrote a lyric like that, they'd be condemned as juvenile! Double standards, I think!    Heartbreaker: nice rhythm, some fancy fretwork by Page on guitar, and a long guitar solo to boot. It's bluesy hard rock. Features the lyric \\"The man is back in town\\"...a line which also features in the AC/DC classic song \\"T.N.T\\". The bass guitar is very muscular in this song.    Living loving maid: Sort of catchy song-the chorus especially-in a 60s pop style. Features the lyric \\"So you better lay your money down\\", which sounded familiar to me...not sure if the Australian band Skyhooks used the same line in one of their songs too.    Ramble on: might be the first ever song to reference J.R.R.Tolkien's novel \\"Lord of the rings\\"! Kudos to Bonham for mixing up his drum sounds...it sounds like his tapping on a clip-board or something! The song has nice genteel parts as well as more bassy and rock parts.     Moby Dick: the first example in modern pop/rock music that I am aware of for extended drum solo instrumentals is Cream's \\"Toad\\". Around the same time as Led Zeppelin recorded this instrumental, Black Sabbath recorded an instrumental featuring a drum solo of their own, \\"Rat salad\\", from their masterpiece album \\"Paranoid\\". Led Zeppelin's track, like the others mentioned here, is topped and tailed by a band jam session. The middle of the track is an extended drum solo. The solo is interesting and relaxing to listen to at times. There are versions of this track which are interminable, live, or so I've heard. Can't say that I like this drum solo as much as Cozy Powell's classic \\"Dance with the devil\\", which seems to me to have been quite influential, insofaras others have 'borrowed' the drum pattern, to my ears at least (e.g. Boney M's \\"Rasputin\\", from memory). Cozy Powell's drumming hero, Cozy Cole also has a very good drum solo track from a decade ago, in \\"Topsy part 2).    Even though Led Zeppelin were very successful with their debut album around the world, even in Australia, it is with this album that they produced a song, in \\"Whole lotta love\\" which would provide fodder for commercial FM radio stations over here. You will never here anything from their debut album played on those stations here, I don't think. And whole lotta love is the only song from this album which gets played over here. It might be their most commonly played song here in Australia. Their follow up album also contained one song which still gets airplay today, over here, but it isn't until IV that Led Zeppelin created an album with more than one song which commercial stations raided and still use today.    My initial impression was that this album was worth around 70/100, but on second listen, it might be worth up to 75/100. Superior to their debut album, in my opinion, which was quite rootsy.
B000001EIA|4.0|Kiss translates well into an acoustic set. This is just as good as any studio recorded album.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Great addition to anyone's collection.  It's a remastered classic that the kids will love.
B000025APX|3.0|The cool thing about Amon Amarth is that they can continue the same sound without sounding old or like they are regurgitating a previous album. This album follows up \\"Once Sent From the Golden Hall\\" and delivers a platter of metal that leaves you wanting more. The production here is a bit raw, at least compared to more modern recordings. Though probably not necessary, I would like for it to get remastered like its predecessor.
B00005JKDR|5.0|The movie is very entertaining and funny.  Well put together and the DVD extras on the collector's addition are amazing.
B001JFZ118|3.0|This is a cult classic. I have always loved this movie. My only complaint is that here and there the audio drops out, causing one \\"quiet\\" line to be heard, and the next to be difficult to hear, even when the volume is turned up very high.

Can't wait for the next installment of the Kingkiller Chronicles, The Wise Man's Fear, to be released.
B000PTZ7RC|3.0|This is a great album by all original members of Kiss. Granted, some of the songs are wanting, \\"You Wanted the Best,\\" but others deliver the goods, \\"I Pledge Allegiance to the State of Rock & Roll\\" and the title cut for instance.
B0012GMZMW|5.0|The greatest Rock Record Ever Made!!!! Steve Augeri definitely shines on his first record with Journey.

B001UE276A|5.0|Full of wonderful material, Depeche Mode's [[ASIN:B001UE276A Sounds of the Universe Deluxe Box Set (3 CDs/DVD/2 Books)]] is a must-have for DM fans.  The large, sturdy box contains three CDs, a DVD containing music in 5.1 surround sound, two books, art cards with different artists' takes on the album cover, a poster, some pins, and a certificate of authenticity.<br /><br />First of all, the music is great.  I've been listening to DM and collecting DM material since Some Great Reward (and later picked up all their previous releases) and I think all the experimentations in style have finally culminated into a final epic collection of music.  From the minimalist suggestions of Exciter to the growling gospel of SOFAD, you can hear it all on Sounds of the Universe.  But I think the most interesting part is how all the styles of the past 28 years are now accompanied by analog synths, some of which were probably used on early material.  By nature of the way these synths produce sound the results are full and warm, and envelope you with an experience that must be heard in the 5.1 surround sound provided by the included DVD.<br /><br />My favorite songs are \\"In Chains\\", \\"Corrupt\\", and \\"Perfect\\".  I love the way \\"In Chains\\" builds throughout the entire song, slowly adding instruments as it goes with small breaks in between.  It's nearly hypnotizing in the way it moves.  Dave contributes three tunes, and they are very good.  The evolution occurring in his songwriting skills are apparent here.  For those of you following the YouTube releases during production, there was a release of \\"Hole to Feed\\" that I actually like better than the version included on the CD.  They are two very different takes on the same song, and both of them are quite enjoyable.<br /><br />The bonus songs are also very good, \\"Ghost\\" being my favorite and \\"Oh Well\\" taking second place.  For true DM fans, the album isn't complete without this additional material.  The demos are very interesting - the musicians in the fan base will love these but they can also serve as quite pleasant background music.<br /><br />The books were surprisingly impressive.  I wasn't expecting the high-quality, attractive packaging and such sturdy hard-cover volumes - and even the photography is impressive.  The layout is very professional, and helps tell a story.  For DM fans, some of the photos will flood you with memories of everything this band has gone through to finally achieve the peace they now enjoy when working in the studio.  It's great to see them all well and working great together.

B000Q66Q06|5.0|The 1992 Berlin Philharmonic concert for New Year's Eve is an outstanding event on DVD.  In particular, the empathy shown between Martha Argerich -- the phenomenal pianist, Claudio Abbaddo -- the consummate conductor, and the unnamed tympanist--in perhaps the biggest orchestral role for the instrument (apart from the Berlioz \\"Symphonie Fantastique\\"), makes richard Strauss' \\"Burleske\\" more than a humorous display piece -- the close interplay between the three makes for one of the most electric concert performances I've ever witnessed. BRAVISSIMO!

0439023483|5.0|In a society where reality programming reigns supreme readers should feel somewhat comfortable with the main premise of this novel. The Tributes are but twenty-four tiny fish swimming in a barbarically dark bowl where morality is pitted against the basic instinct for survival. Readers are simply one of the outsiders looking in completely enthralled by the complexity of character and plot.<br /><br />This book was spectacular in a myriad of ways not the least of which was the vivid imagery. Collins writes so eloquently that the reader is transported directly into The Seam where the District 12 lower class lives. We could smell the rancid air, feel the dirty grime on our skin, and hear the rumbling stomachs as if we were standing in the center of town ourselves.<br /><br />The scenery was so clearly painted that physical locations became characters of the story as much as were Katniss, Peeta and the many people they encountered. District 12's darkness in contrast to the shiny brightness of The Capitol was so profound readers couldn't help but be struck by how misleading their characterizations really were. You see, while the citizens of District 12 were certainly suffering they were still inherently happy because they were together. On the other hand even though it appeared that The Capitol's populace was happy, that is all it was the appearance of happiness to maintain a State sponsored image.<br /><br />Even so, the most compelling character of the novel is Katniss. A young woman of such an impressionable age she's faced with more than the usual pre-teen questions of what boy she should date, what fashions she should wear, and whether she should skip class or not. Here she was the breadwinner, doting sister, best-friend, coveted love and figurehead all at such a tender age. She's hot tempered, outspoken, strong-willed and, despite the vulgar circumstances she's thrown into, resoundingly tender and caring. Readers root for her from start to finish.<br /><br />Surprisingly it is all of these traits that turn the readers eyes towards a focus on love. Among all this gore and savagery a great many people love Katniss. It is the love of her family that sustains and motivates her. The love of her best friend Gale that helps her fight to get back to District 12 to see if things aren't strictly platonic. The adoration and respect of new colleagues when Cinna and his team of publicists help transform Katniss into the image of whom she'll portray in The Games. Then most significantly the real and abiding love of a boy interested in her for more than friendship.<br /><br />The beginnings of this love story are strung through a heavy and dark story. The trip readers take is not an easy journey but one that is well worth the effort. In forewarning readers need to be prepared to handle heavy themes. It questions morality and focuses on aggression as a way to not only punish but to entertain as well. Specifically, the actual Hunger Games pit children against children in a violent and brutal challenge for survival. Death is seen closely and described in detail on several occasions throughout.<br /><br />In the end the reader will find that while themes are dark and sometimes violent the beautiful prose and characterization from which they are derived makes the ride edge of your seat exciting.that turn the readers eyes towards a focus on love.

Barry comps behind Lee and Joe Henderson's tenor sax like you wouldn't believe.  And Billy Higgins on drums with a bluesy plucked bass of Bob Cranshaw.  A quintet who produce some very, very tasty sounds.  You gotta, just gotta, listen to this savory, riff-rich jazz.

B0009A1AS2|5.0|I've tried to convert several of my friends to Dream Theater. I mean, come on... DT has something for just about everyone who appreciates good music. Octavarium to me is DT's crossover into more \\"mainstream\\" music but still has it's feet firmly planted in the ground. The title track is an amazing achievement on it's own. Several tracks remind me of the better \\"hair bands\\" from the day. I love this album. All the songs are good. I can't just pick them apart. They are all good...
B001MV49HG|4.0|Yeah, it's self-conscious, yeah, it takes itself seriously to the point of pretention, and yes, I arrived at it prepared to recognize another overhyped mesh of faux-messianic Nineties whine-rock--but when younger brother Liam Gallagher coughs, \\"I think I've got a feeling I've lost inside,\\" he sounds sincere.  And while \\"Cast No Shadow\\" fit with my expectations for the album, the rest broke free: they're shiny (embarrassingly Beatles-ish candypop \\"She's Electric\\"), they're sweet (bitterly so: rock with the hulking \\"Morning Glory\\"), they're catchy (\\"Roll with It\\"), and most of the time they're sincere.  Just to throw in my few pennies about the Contest of the Singles, I'd trust a \\"Wonderwall\\" supporter over a \\"Champagne Supernova\\" fan most days of the week.  And I'd trust anyone who recognizes the futile misdirection of the album as its greatest strength much more than I'd trust any of the thousands of airheaded \\"Q\\" subscribers who voted this charmingly-flawed delight the 2nd best album in British history.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|One thought: I don't know why this movie isn't more popular.<br /><br />The story is entertaining, with an intricate plot, a variety of likeable characters, and a healthy dose of humor amid London's tough criminal underbelly.<br /><br />The cast is amazing, ranging from Tom Wilkinson as the seemingly all-powerful Lenny Cole, Thandie Newton as the dangerous and sexy accountant Stella (an almost oxymoronic combination that RocknRolla somehow pulls off), Gerard Butler as the almost innocent small time hustler One Two, and a host of other talent including Mark Strong, Jeremy Piven, and Chris (Ludacris) Bridges.<br /><br />The scenes manage to be both intense and humorous, with two of the best robberies in cinema history leading the charge.<br /><br />RocknRolla has it all.
B001U5V03U|3.0|For some reason, this performance is cold. Keenlyside is a fine artist, but no matter how much he strips down, he is not convincing, and lacks charisma. Leporello is also a fake plebeian. The Donna Anna is weak. Joyce Di Donato is an excellent singer, but she is miscast here. Ramon Vargas is the best of the men, as good as anybody ever, and so is Miah Perrson, who does have plenty of charm and plenty of voice.The production itself is boring.I don't recall any other Don Giovanni that has left me with no desire to look at it again.
B000QXDED6|4.0|I didn't see 300 when it appeared in theaters. Like many, I had briefly studied the history of the battle of Thermopylae, and found the story intriguing. However, I expected 300 to be nothing but a series of fight scenes with little else to contribute. I also shied away from its popularity, as I strive to avoid most fads.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />300 presents a deep retelling of an historic battle, leaving the audience pondering the virtues of honor, duty, and glory.<br /><br />It is relatively short for this sort of historical movie, which lends to its ability to be watched over and over again. The cinematography is absolutely amazing, and the stunt fighting is so well choreographed and executed that you really leave the story with a renewed understanding of the dominance of the Spartan military.<br /><br />Although not technically historically accurate in places (though it's hard to be sure of history that occurred more than 2000 years ago), 300 does do a good job of communicating the ideals of Spartan culture. Also, some of the dialogue is actually historically attributed to the characters who spoke them (such as Queen Gorgo's quip that only Spartan women give birth to real men), and Spartans leaving for battle were indeed reminded to \\"come back with your shield, or on it\\" (as the shield was used to protect not only the individual but other Spartan warriors, if the shield was lost it was assumed that it was abandoned in an attempt to flee, which constituted a high crime).<br /><br />Gerard Butler, with his intense and moving screen presence, was the perfect choice for King Leonidas (and also, amazingly, had the strength and fortitude to perform all of his own stunt fighting). Also notable were Dominic West in his portrayal of devious and sleazy Theron, Michael Fassbender as the Spartan warrior Stelios (who is not a major character, but whose valor and fighting skills are surpassed only by Leonidas, in my opinion), and David Wenham portraying Delios, the narrator and Spartan warrior with a penchant for words.<br /><br />Lastly, it deserves mentioning that the actors playing the Spartan warriors represent the pinnacle of physical fitness; man or woman could easily lose themselves staring into the chiseled abdominals, the surging back muscles, or the powerful thighs.<br /><br />300 is recommended for anyone intrigued by Greek history, anyone seeking a good action movie, anyone seeking to be uplifted by a story of free men fighting to maintain their independence against a tyrant, and anyone who has any appreciation for beautiful cinematography. In short, 300 is recommended for anyone.a penchant for words.    Lastly, it deserves mentioning that the actors playing the Spartan warriors represent the pinnacle of physical fitness; man or woman could easily lose themselves staring into the chiseled abdominals, the surging back muscles, or the powerful thighs.    300 is recommended for anyone intrigued by Greek history, anyone seeking a good action movie, anyone seeking to be uplifted by a story of free men fighting to maintain their independence against a tyrant, and anyone who has any appreciation for beautiful cinematography.

1600242197|4.0|Book brings a real insight into what it takes to become a US Navy Seal.  The true story shows the dedication these guys possessed and their willingness to give their lives for our great country.  It also made a point that President George W. Bush was our fighters president and they would die for him and our cause.  This cannot be said about other U S presidents, past or present.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is a great book - well written, fascinating with characters that I felt compelled to research they were so larger than life. Loved it.
B00000IQW5|4.0|This movie is great. It has some action, love & comedy. My dad helped build the plane that Richard flies for the movie. It's a must see flick.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|This remastered version in HD is excellent.  This show was WAAAAAY ahead of its time, and is still very enjoyable to watch.  The remastering was done very well and even tho some of the external space scenes and the ship have been digitized they look very good.  Worth buying if ever a Trek fan and you have a Toshiba or other HDDVD player.
B000056TKC|5.0|Very simply, Fricsay's Beethoven Opus 125 captures the joy of Beethoven's final symphony in a way that few others do.  It evolves in the most natural and logical and life-affirming way.  Each movement, in turn, adopts a dedicated rhythm and mood that instantly establishes its purpose and maintains it as the movement progresses, thereby allowing each to play its proper role as a part of the whole.  Movement I immediately roars into that sense of barely-controlled turmoil that frustrates humankind but never completely excoriates the hope that lies within its heart.  Movement II laughs along crisply and sardonically as it should, and Fricsay's Movement III, the blessed Adagio, flows unerringly like a soothing river through a veritable valley of peace.  It is a true meditation of the spirit, gentle but never sluggish, preparing the soul finally for the eruption of happiness that is to follow.      Fricsay's finale is not the most Heaven-storming on disc - meaning it does not artificially inflate the dynamics of the music into a caricature - but it is possibly the most humane and intrisically joyful account out there, and isn't this what the piece is all about?  The first five minutes, in which each previous theme is replayed and rejected in favor of the simple but so-perfect final, earthy song of joy, encapsulates the travail that has gone before and utterly dispels it.  The final 20 minutes is the musical representation of fondest hopes fully realized, bettered by no version that I know and hardly equalled anywhere.  Alongside Fricsay, only a few, like Mackerras and Blomstedt, manage to bring the finale to full fruition, and many others - Karajan, Solti, etc. - eschew the wonder and joyful abandon in exchange for power or assertiveness, which in this reviewer's opinion is not what this music is ultimately about.  In sort, Fricsay \\"gets it\\" where few others do.    There is one small drawback, and that is that the finale was recorded at a different session, and the sonics - the microphone placement and levels - were slightly different.  This manifests itself mostly as a small reduction in volume.  Be prepared to turn it up a tad for this last movement.    The Egmont Overture that comes with it is simply as good as any, full of verve and good enough to make the listener stand and cheer at the end.  An excellent coupling in every way.    If I could choose only one Beethoven Opus 125, it would be this one.  No other version leaves this soul feeling exhilarated and ready to face another day as this one does.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Many people say this is how the PS3 controller should have been originally designed and I can't agree more.  They snap on pretty permanently, I attempted to remove mine to see how hard it would be to pull them off and stopped before I broke something.  I don't see how you can pop them off unless you're trying to break them or simply acting like a moron.  They do give kind of the same rounded trigger feel similar to a Xbox 360 controller and I like it.  I've had three of my other PS3 owning friends give my two controllers with the realtriggers a try and all three ended up ordering them on their next Amazon purchase.    You can't beat them for the price and if you're ordering a game or another accessory go ahead and take advantage of the free super saver shipping and add them to you order.  No matter what style games you're into you won't be disappointed.
B00005MJ13|5.0|Fricsay was a genius, an individualist when he needed to be and formal classicist when he needed to be - and he had an almost unerring sense about when and where to be one or the other.  Here, in the highly romantic and volatile music of Eastern European composers, he instinctively knew to adopt a free form and let his passions guide his baton.  The approach works beautifully, whether in the alternating moods of Dvorak's most famous symphony, the ebb and flow of Smetana's beloved river, or the stormy life and transcendence of Liszt's life metaphor.  The Symphony in particular is different, but at the end one feels that the interpretation is spot-on and fully validated.  This is why I love Fricsay - he gets it right, even when he does it differently.<br /><br />As stated before, the sound on the Symphony is slightly coarse, and it takes a few moments for the ear to adjust.  Don't let this stop you - this is a performance of great stature, and well worth hearing repeatedly.  The other two pieces sound fine, without any distortion, and the Moldau in particular is almost as good as a real whitewater rafting trip.  For perfromances of all three pieces, this disc is front and center, great and stimulating music making.
B000TGCR38|1.0|I just bought this movie for my Dad for Father's Day. He's Dutch, Mom is American, and I thought they both could enjoy watching the movie together.    It turns out that the subtitles ran off the bottom of the screen, so my Dad had to interpret the whole movie.    What a shame. I thought I hit a home run with this present, but I struck out!
B0000025RI|5.0|Thriller is greatest selling album of all time because it is really a fantastic record. There's nothing more to say about the music that hasn't already been said. He was a flawed human being, like we all are, but a cultural icon who did more for race relations via his art form than most who devote their lives to the political pursuit of race relations. A great entertainer. That's all he needed to be for me. Rest in peace, MJ.

0452295548|4.0|My Stroke of Insight is Jill Taylor's remarkable tale about her recovery from a terrible brain hemorrhage.  Before her stroke, she was an accomplished Neuroanatomist.  She taught medical students about the brain, and even worked at the Brain Bank, an organization that would accept brain donations in order to further the understanding of the human brain.  Her entire life changed, however, when she had a stroke.  She completely lost touch with the left hemisphere of her brain.  Not only did she have to re-learn how to do everything, from walking to writing, but she had to do it with half of a functional brain.    Taylor took a very interesting approach to writing her book.  The way it is written, it is as if the she is actually speaking to me.  This was very effective in keeping my attention.  It also helped Taylor convey her message better.  The first chapter really just seemed dedicated to bragging about how smart the author is.  Given, she uses it to show us the difference between her pre- and post-stroke life, but it comes off a little shy of modest nonetheless.    Although the first chapter served a purpose, the next two were fairly dull and seemed out of place with the entire story.  It was like an intermission in a long play.  Though the facts presented in the chapters may be interesting to a select few, Taylor effectively details what she can and cannot do throughout the book and specifically mentions what part of the brain is responsible for it.  Therefore, re-reading chapters two and three, I found them to be very redundant.  Luckily, in chapter four, the book finally starts to become interesting, albeit Taylor still tries to impress her readers with her vast knowledge of the brain.    The fifth chapter was the most exciting out of the entire book.  It really delivered that sense of urgency that she must have felt at the time.  It was almost as if I were reading an action novel.  I found myself reading faster and faster as she desperately tried to make a phone call.  Even when she was able to dial, I felt a stab of despair when she could no longer communicate her situation to her would-be rescuer.  I remember a wave of relief washing over me when her co-worker arrived at the door to take her to the hospital.    I was still very shaken up by the helplessness that Taylor experienced.  Being helpless and completely dependent on others is one of my biggest fears.  I am not sure how well I could have handled the situation, nor am I interested in finding out.  The most amazing part was that with all of her vast knowledge, she was unable to recognize what was wrong until the stroke really hit her.  It seemed like she did suspect something was wrong, but she was in denial at first.  When the right side of her brain was forced to take over, she fell under its peaceful seduction and allowed the hemorrhage to get much worse.    After beginning the next chapter, I noticed an inconsistency in Taylor's writing.  Each chapter was as if it were from a different book.  It started like a biography on the author's life, turned into a textbook about the human brain, than became a fast-paced action story, and the next couple of chapters were like a hazy dream.  With any other book it would be a nuisance, but in My Stroke of Insight it does an excellent job of showing how everything is in constant disarray when the brain suffers from a stroke.  I'm not sure if that is what Taylor was aiming for when she wrote her book, but I found it to be very poetic.  She did an excellent job in writing the book, and I am very pleased that I had the opportunity to read it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This is one of the better Maiden albums I have heard. It gets better every time I listen to it. Not as good as Piece of Mind, but what is? Unexpected from a classic metal band in their 50's in the mid 2000's, but I just can't stop listening to it. My favorite songs: Montsegur(great), Paschendale, title song. Highly recommended.

B000WS4QJG|5.0|The album of the last century, and will last for many more. A true pop classic, even after 25 years sounding as fresh as ever.<br /><br />In the long run, this is what Michael will be remembered for.<br /><br />Rest in Peace, and thank you for your gift of music, Michael.
B001H1OUW0|3.0|This is one of Miles' best records. When I got back into vinyl, I absolutely had to get it in this format. I couldn't wait for it to arrive and when it did I was truly disappointed. The surface noise was the loudest I've ever heard. In a record like this which is full of soft passages and silences this can be very annoying.  Right now I'm waiting for a replacement, but I think there won't be much difference.

I will agree to the plea bargain when you give in to the tranquilizer. Go ahead and work it out for yourself. I will be waiting in the oak tree in the park.

B000K7UBTI|1.0|The only cool thing about this movie was the dvd cover-which lies.In the movie his armor isn't red/gold or looks cool.<br /><br />Do your yourself a favor and forget this Piece OF CRAP even existed.
B00005QGAX|5.0|The Good:  A well mastered special edition CD. Good sound quality for a 1987 recording. Sony has managed to get the sound quality right with MJ's CDs but failed to get the same impact with his DVDs. I ordered this CD from Amazon in Dec 2008.  I was barely 10 when I first heard this album - 'Bad', back in 1988. The music instantly grabbed my attention. I was spell bound, the music really stood out from all the other kinds of slow & dull music that was popular at that time. To my young ears it was amazing. I did not get hold of this album until May 1992. I borrowed it from my neighbor & recorded it. I played the recorded cassette tape on a Bush 2-in-1 system, (Remember those boom box days? Lol.) almost everyday, till the tape actually wore out.  In 1993, we shifted to another state, I had the opportunity to explore MJ's other albums & videos. Made some great friends with common interest in MJ's music. Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever records one of the best shows ever recorded. It's the one in which MJ first moonwalked on stage while singing Billie Jean. A pioneer in catchy dance, songs & videos. Always in the news & at times for doing weird stuff. MTV & MJ had a very symbiotic relationship they pushed each other to great heights that is unlikely to happen again. He was the greatest entertainer of our time. Period. Today marks a great loss in the history of music.  I think, I would not have gotten so far into audiophilia, as a hobby, if it was not for this gem of an album. Truly a turning point. I like 'Bad' better than MJ's other albums.  If Google is the most powerful information tool of the 21st century & if we were to use it to gauge popularity, then the statistics goes like this: MJ has 80 million articles, Jesus Christ has 40 million articles & The Beatles has 35 million articles. Pls check this for yourself in Google. Alright, I'm not getting into the late 1960s - 'The Beatles vs Jesus Christ' popularity controversy here. Please forgive me if I have offended anyone reading this. I was only presenting facts from Google the way they are. Peace.  The Bad:  I don't want to hear Quincy Jones' commentary / interview in between the last few songs of the CD. That's what this limited edition MJ's 'Bad' CD does & it's very annoying.  Update: 25Jun 2010:  It's been an year since I wrote the above review. Today there are 127 million articles in Google for MJ. That makes him the most popular personality on the planet.
0312857063|5.0|Terry Goodkind is a fantastic writer. Once you start reading it is hard to put the book down. You are riveted to the adventures of Richard and Kahlan as they fight off the demons and evil people one by one. He has you on edge the whole time and feeling deeply for these characters. I am looking forward to the next book to see what other phenominal adventures Richard and Kahlan will have on their journey to right the world.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I had not listened to this record in awhile, and as the news broke, I put it on.    There is a reason why it is the best selling record of all time.  Billie Jean, Beat It, Thriller.      From his work in the Jackson 5 to this, he always broke new ground and changed pop music.  This record, rightfully so, is one of the highlights of his solo career.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I saw Halestorm last night in Charleston and did they rock hard. Amazingly talented band, the drum solo they did in the middle was awesome. The live version of Familiar Taste Of Poison was incredible.<br /><br />I've seen mentions of comparisons to Pat Benatar & Heart but the band / performer that came to my mind most listening to and seeing them is Joan Jett. Lzzy has the growl and attitude, the guitarist was tight, her brother has the drums on lockdown and he and the bassist are in the pocket, holding it all together. The production is a bit slick but they are able to recreate almost all the production live so I won't fault them that.<br /><br />Buy the album and you will not regret it. As someone else said, next time they come round I do believe they won't be playing a small club but a larger venue.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I absolutely loved the stage production and was so excited about the movie. I had my doubts that Meryl Streep was cast right... I would have thought someone like Diane Lane would have looked better in the part, but I was bowled over! Meryl Streep did a great job- as usual ... as did everyone else. You can't really go wrong with such a stellar cast- Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth and so many other familiar faces! This is such a feel good movie ... I could get a dose of this every day! If you like ABBA and want to feel up-lifted, then this is the movie for you!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I had the pleasure of sitting in on the Thriller sessions at Westlake Recording Studio. My father, Bruce Swedien, recorded all of Michael Jackson's albums since 1978. The reason \\"Thriller\\" is the best selling album of all time is not just because of the great music, it's because of the awesome talent of Michael Jackson. It is also the because of the awesome talent of Quincy Jones, Rod Temperton, and my father. Three of the best singles ever recorded are on \\"Thriller\\". Michael never sat still in the studio, he was always moving and dancing. He danced when he sang the vocals, he danced in the control room and he danced up and down the hallways like a little kid. But beyond his Peter pan persona, Michael was a very kind and gracious person. He was also painfully shy and I remember seeing him in a meeting with his manager in the kitchen at Westlake Studio, sitting in the dark. He did it with Quincy, too. Michael was so eccentric. But a great talent is allowed great indulgences. I got goosebumps when I heard that he died. He was so talented. Godspeed, Michael. We'll all miss you. Thanks for Christmas at your house.

0060555661|3.0|Let me first say that I am a big fan of Jason Zweig. When Zweig tells us where to put our money we should all listen. I enjoy his columns and advice in Money magazine, and I think he speaks with the reader's interests at heart and he does so with common sense.     But let's be clear that there are two schools of common sense:    1) Value investing aims to exploit the common-sense notion that you can buy a dollar for 75 cents.     2)Index investing, on the other hand, proposes that an individual investor is not equipped to accomplish the task of above-market investing (when I say not equipped I mean equipped by either intelligence, financial resources, time constraints, emotional immaturity, etc.).    Both have their merits. But Zweig uses the Graham text, from school #1, as a springboard to convince the reader of the virtues of school #2. The result is a sloppy commentary at best, and, at times, incoherent and inconsistent.     Zweig, if you want to sell people on index investing, you chose the wrong book to support your thesis!    This is the main reason why I give this edition three stars versus the five Graham deserves: THE ZWEIG COMMENTARY IS DETRIMENTAL TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF GRAHAM. The arguments linking the Malkiel/Bogle Index Investor school to the Graham/Buffett school of thought aren't very well supported. Both are common sense but each has its own reasoning. This makes the task of understanding the text on its own merits more difficult, not less! That's not commentary! That's an agenda of using the text for your own purposes.     This book is a classic. On those grounds alone you should pick it up. Moreoever, as a means of transmitting the core principles of value investing it still remains, as Buffett notes, near the top. You should go straight to the hardcover and hear these words as they were intended to be heard.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had heard that Firefly was really good and read the multitude of reviews here on Amazon (most of them 5 stars). And now that I've watched the entire series (including Serentity, the movie) I agree 100%!! In my opinion, Firefly is very nearly the perfect TV series. It's only real flaw is that it ends after 14 episodes. The show is a wonderful blend of dialog, action, humor, mystery, setting, character, science, soundtrack, and visual appeal. Put all together, it's a show to watch again and again. For me, that fact uniquely makes the purchase of this collection the best bargain of all.

1563890119|5.0|This Graphic Novel is Breath Taking. I like Neil Gaimen's work but this would be my favorite. Preludes & Nocturnes is instantly one of my favorite graphic novels. It has an original plot and characters that you just find interesting at the moment that they are introduced. The writing style is wonderful. I can't wait until I get the next Sandman.
0439023483|5.0|Once I started this book I could not put it down! I found all the character's really easy to relate to, and the plot held my interest quite easily. I found the similarities between the games and reality TV scary in a good way. I would recomend this book to anyone! However, if you have a hard time dealing with brutal death, don't read it. The deaths complete the story and are necessary, but are not for the faint of heart. This book is one of my all time favorites!

B00297FEUI|3.0|Probably the most anticipated blockbuster score of the summer right up there with Giacchino's Star Trek and Hooper's upcoming Harry Potter score. Well, I waited to write a review until after I saw the film since this release is only a pathetic 44 minute sampling of a 121 minute score.<br /><br />What we have on the CD is all of the new stuff Jablonsky did for the film, and originally I thought all of the great themes he established in the first score would appear in the film. Sadly they only pop in once in awhile. We do have some good stuff here. The \\"new\\" theme can be heard right off the bat in \\"Prime\\". That theme is echoed in tracks like \\"Infinite White\\" with vocals by the lovely Lisbeth Scott. Then there's the standard action staple of the heavy male chorus that defines the Decepticons, which Hans made famous with his 90's action scores.<br /><br />Overall there are some great tracks here in full Jablonsky style, but it's lacking that structure that I loved from the first film and the first score CD. After watching the film and listening to the CD it was pretty much anticlimactic. I was waiting for it to go rise and rise, go full throttle then bring us back down like the final battle in Mission City from the first film. We don't get that here, and not even in the movie. I loved the first movie but thought this one was pretty bad. The score never rose to the occasion and level as the first film and was lost amidst the poor structure, pacing and story of the film. It's honestly a better standalone listen than in the film. The tracks with Lisbeth Scott are amazing.<br /><br />Another thing that really hurt this score was Linkin Park's involvement. I don't know whose idea was it to toss them in the scoring process, but it's really rediculous. Fine, they wrote a song for the end credits but let's keep it that way. I don't need the heavy rock to emerge every few scenes as the \\"NEST\\" theme. So, we have some good stuff but it's not at all what I was hoping for. I enjoyed the score, but not the movie. There is so much left to be desired here and I hope a more complete release is coming down the line, but for now I guess this release will have to do.movie.

B001V7YWTQ|5.0|Wow - I love the jam music of the sixties - seventies...Hendrix, Townshend and of course Clapton. This CD is an amazing display of one of the greatest living rock guitarist we have.    I keep comparing tracks of Voodoo Chile from Hendrix Live and Clapton's version here....and as much as I love Jimi...I think Clapton's live version here...dare I say...may be a bit better, if only for the clarity of the recording. But Clapton has not slowed and his technique is unspeakable.     I love this CD...oh and Winwood's pretty good too....:)
006135323X|2.0|My disclaimer is that I am a layman.  I have no ties to the medical/scientific community.  I'm an optimist; my cognitive bias favored purchasing this book.      The author provides an example of Pepsi and Coca Cola, where both companies claimed that their product won in taste tests.  He goes on to state the reason both companies claimed favoritism towards their product was due to the manner in which the taste tests were conducted.  This is exactly what Ariely does throughout this book.  I'm quite certain that scientists would scoff at the manner in which these 'experiements' were conducted.  Ariely got the result he wanted - everytime.  What type of cognitive bias is that?  As a previous reviewer commented, the results of the experiments were highly predictable.    The reason that I purchase this and other books is that I want to know why I make the mistakes I make.  I want to know why I act irrationally at times, and set out to read books on this topic. I have read books on intuition, critical thinking, etc., in an attempt to improve my decision-making.    I found the book amuzing - sometimes, but it did not offer much in the way of helping me with my personal goals. My expectation was only reading a book as part of the puzzle, based on the favorable reviews.    This book was like a sunken souffle: it may have looked beautifully golden and risen in the oven, but the end result...

B000053VJI|5.0|Very happy to have gotten this cd.  I had it originally but someone borrowed it for a party and returned to me the empty case.  I thought it was inside until I went to play the cd and found the case empty.  It was almost 8 years ago and I was afraid I was not going to be able to replace it without going all the way back to Panama, my country of origin where I bought it originally.  I was glad to find it in Amazon.com!

032147404X|3.0|I do not regret buying this book because it contains many useful hints.  It also contains many hints of little use.  It contains absolutely no information to allow the reader to get a better understanding of the underlying principles of photography.  To be fair to the author he made this quite clear early in the book.  This book is a very light read or maybe even a browse rather than a read.

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I remember when this album came out I was just 2 or 3 but I still knew who Michael Jackson was because everyone knew who he was. He was a great talent in music and \\"Thriller\\" is the perfect title for his defining masterpiece because that's what it is. Every single song is magical and moving because Michael who was also a consummate professional gave such a stand alone performance that to this day has never been topped. My very favorite song is \\"Billie Jean\\". It's a creative track that mixes dance, pop, hip hop and R&B. I also especially enjoy the title track and \\"Beat It\\" because these are both pure '80s staples. Like millions and millions of people I am heartbroken today. I have been watching his videos on BET since last night and the one thing that resonates through all of his music, ever changing styles and dance moves was Michael's professionalism and perfection. Such an immense and unique talent has left this world. I am not sure of many things in this world and I don't know where Michael Jackson is right now or where he is going. But I am certain that wherever he is there is lots of happiness and beautiful music. Thank you Micahel for all of the years of entertainment and may you rest in peace.
0792839749|5.0|Ever since I was a child, musicals have always caught my attention.  Not the animated Disney kinds, although those are excellent in their own manner, but ones with real people bursting into song and dancing their hearts out.  My first musical was 'Mary Poppins,' which also starred Dick Van Dyke, and I have been hooked since.    Set in England, Van Dyke plays the loving father to twins, a boy and girl, as well as being a somewhat bumbling inventor.  His portrayal and connection with the children is heart-warming, charming, and all-around winning--he can sing and dance exceptionally well!  Sally Howles, his radiant co-star, portrays Truly Scrumptious, who suits her rather unusual name perfectly--like Van Dyke, she is charming with a tongue-in-cheek kind of humor and primness that is all too endearing.    The story takes place before Van Dyke's character pleases his children in purchasing their 'toy' car (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang)--including the means he goes to get the money--and the imaginative story he tells that takes up most of the movie where an evil baron will go to any means of getting the car.    If you have children or simply want to watch a dazzlingly beautiful, heart-warming story, I highly recommend this!  The delivery was faster than I had imagined and the price perfect!
B001RQ0SJO|5.0|The first knowledge that I have about this project with this gorgeous girl and her stunning voice was given to me by Mr Thom Yorke (Radiohead) who said that this girl had tons of talent and a wonderful album on her hands. Well, i decided to give it a shot and I bought \\"Two suns\\" this morning. My personal reaction? Couldn't be more pleased! Natasha Khan has a stunning voice and she makes music in what it seems to be without any doubt: a remarkable singer for a near future. Her voice makes me remember Dolores O'Riordan (Ex Cranberries) by moments but, not even Mrs. O'Riordan sounded so pure and beautiful as Natashe here.<br /><br />The first track \\"Glass\\" is stunning whith some tunes that go beyond simple pop... no way! this girl pushes her boundaries of what she is able to do. Then \\"Sleep alone\\" and \\"Moon and Moon\\" are simply organic... total extasis while you listen to some acoustic guitar and some piano fading away and coming back with intelligent pop textures through both tracks. \\"Daniel\\" on the other hand would be the techno tune that Nataha decided to carry on in the record. \\"Pearl's dream\\" is just another beautiful song made to haunt us down through the valleys of happiness, sadness and joy as well.<br /><br />It's seems that Bat for lashes is a project that tries to sound to a friendlier version of Bjork and eventhough it doesn't get that far, it's still a piece of art that anyone who really wants to discover awesome new singers or bands in the Indie scene should try. I only hope that Natasha Khan keeps on making this kind of music with passion and artistical integrity for many years to come and I really hope that she avoids being swallowed by the all mighty music industry that tries to make music nowadays more commercial and hence, really, really boring. If Thom Yorke told you how great your music was Natasha, you MUST be proud of yourself. Stunning, beautiful album!!!

B00003CXWV|5.0|This was one of the best performances I have seen by Johnny Depp. It showed the in depth view of the cocaine industry and just how powerful the King of Coke really was (Escobar). I'm really surprised that George Jung didn't get sent to prison more often. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone that wanted to know more about not only the cocaine industry but the life and wild times of George Jung.
B002BNKQDK|5.0|Even if you could manage to get the name of the movie you're trying to berate correctly, you would still sound like a raving moron. However, I must say you have quite the knack for play-on words. \\"Watch me.\\" \\"Watchmen.\\" I see it! How clever.  ...  I'm also unclear as to how a movie could be \\"overrated\\" and yet only manage to have a small group of folks enjoy it.     Bizarre is the key word to me in your comment. You use it as if it's a bad thing. Of course Watchmen is bizarre, and I don't think you understand how well you're fitting yourself into the unprepared audiences that Salmon listed in his above comment. Watchmen is bizarre, original, thought-provoking, and monumental. And I'll list some supporting facts unlike you.    1. To date, no superhero movies have touched on the adult themes that would most likely plague the people-behind-the-masks' lives. It created accurate and complex psychological profiles for each character, giving us an in-depth insight. The art and color styling stayed true to the book, and made for a very original and artful look (not to mention that it took several several panels straight from the comic and used them as storyboard.) The entire feel, sound, and content of the movie was quite original.    2. The subject matter was very thought-provoking. It touches heavily on adult roles, the driving force behind the universe, moral ambiguity, and much more. In the end, you decide where you stand with Adrien's plot. There's no implied right or wrong.    3. Just like the book, the movie brought to light all that Watchmen did for comic books back in the day for movies NOW. I cannot recommend the book highly enough, and although the theatrical cut serves as a somewhat incomplete and amended summary, it is the most loyal-to-source-material movie I have ever seen.    Watchmen is a triumph. \\"People must be told.\\" The world will discover eventually... hopefully.    Addressing the actual item, it looks awesome. I'm a collector, and this model looks very impressive. I can't wait for my pre-order to ship, so that this beauty can sit atop my movie shelf and... \\"watch\\" (eh? eh?) over my collection. :) Awesome.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you love old Toshiro Mifune Samurai films, Westerns, and the original Star Trek series, you'll be glad you purchased this series. And you'll be outraged that Fox cancelled it!      Surprising plots lines, wonderful scripting, really good acting, deadpan humor, and romanic tensions makes it impossible to limit myself to viewing just one episode. Reserve a day, or all night for seeing all the episodes, & Serenity. If you order Firefly you MUST buy Serenity, the movie. Money well spent!!!
0064430227|5.0|This book is unsettling.  What is the relation between Harold and other people?  Where did the crayon come from anyway?  If Harold is home only when he draws it, then where was home beforehand?  How could he know to look for it as he grew tired?  But the unsettling questions are productive and, I imagine, part of the child's enjoyment of the story.  After all, drawing one's own dragons to guard one's own trees is part of the fun.     I say that this is one very deserving porcupine of a book, and it bristles with unformulated questions that toddlers might think to ask.  Purple...why that exactly?  And why can't more children's books be about girls?  Ah, the sweet mysteries of life that remain to be thought through after the pages have been finished.
0061191981|1.0|I liked Gordon, believed I understood his passion.  What a relief to know he is just another whiner, I can save my admiration for those more worthy.  He can and does excuse everything, every fault, every failing, it's his father's fault, his brother's, his business partner's, his friend's, he is responsible for nothing that could be called a personal, or business failure.      He shagged his boss's wife, well, why didn't the boss stay home?  He was young.  He didn't have a contract, he was inexperienced, his best friend died and he made inappropriate comments, blame it on his youth, his passion, his ambition.      Stay out of his way, not many survive with a good reputation.

0307655105|5.0|I wrote this for the Unabridged edition, but I thought it would be useful to post it here as well:<br /><br />A few notes on the differences between the unabridged \\"1400 Objects\\" edition of Richard Scarry's Best Word Book Ever, published 1963-1979 vs. the later 1980- \\"Revised\\" version. (Note not all post 1980 printings include the word revised on the cover, but they are all the revised edition.)<br /><br />Golden books asked for a the late edit, which consists of three basic changes:<br />1. Political correctness, more animals are made \\"female\\" by attaching bows to their illustrations in the later edition.<br />2. 20 pages were removed, and lighter weight paper was used, to reduce printing costs.<br />3. Complexity of the vocabulary was reduced.<br /><br />Someone noted the price difference, demand for the longer and more complex original exceeds supply, as it is out of print, and not likely to reappear.<br /><br />While both versions are fine books, and an asset to any child's library, those seeking a cheaper book may seek the edited 70 page Abridged edition (anything 1980 or later,) but parents with the budget to cover it would probably want to consider the original, which goes more in depth.<br /><br />A brief example to illustrate the point. Both editions have a section on art, describing colors and how they mix, paints, crayons, pencils and erasers. The later edition stops here. The earlier \\"Unabridged\\" goes on to introduce artists, sketches, canvas, murals, finger painting, still lifes, models, palletes, etc.<br /><br />This wider reach of vocabulary and concepts is thematic of the 20 pages which were removed in the 1980 edit. The later edition still makes a fine starter and welcome edition to any child's library.
1400063515|4.0|this book got a lot of hype so i was ready to ignore it (itself a contrarian statement!). i am glad i didn't.    taleb questions the basis we use for prediction and planning, be it economics, government, business or personal decisions. in doing so, he quotes underappreciated sources going back to classical greece. he casts doubt on so-called experts in many spheres who have missed step-function changes (e.g. current economic meltdown).    you don't have to agree with -- or understand! (I didn't) -- everything he says. it will cause you to think differently in a good way.

0374139563|4.0|DEAD AID from Dambisa MOYO.  I have to say that reading the lady's book has been truly refreshing.    I've not been a regular book reader these last years, but this is about to change with Amazone and the likes.  The reason why I bought the book is that Dambisa Moyo has been given the opportunity to explain and defend here views and she did it brillantly in a number of TV shows. I particularly liked when she talked about the Bono trend of rock stars recycling into developpement experts. The idea that no one would expect the government of France to seek economical advises from Michael Jackson (may he rest in peace) or from Manu Dibango is obvious.  These are serious matters. And I think she did a good job of trying to remind it. As for the people criticizing here, some have said that here book would have been scrutinized harder if it wasn't for her beeing African. This is BS. She has been asked all the though questions and she answered all of them.  As for my appreciation of the book. I totaly subscribe to the impact of AID on government accountability and corruption. I consider this to be a huge \\"issue\\".  Now I don't beleave in a benevolant dictator. I find it too risky to rely on any one person for such a huge work. I'd rather start an Obama like work of empowering the people even if it may be a longer route to a better future. The second interessting point is the impact of curroption and random law enforcement on investments, especially for local investment. I think we need to stress the fact that FDI are not the only ones to need a clean, secured and fair bussiness environment. The lack of it is currently the main reason why people are leaving their own country and are not coming back.   Regarding \\"micro finance\\" as a solution for developpement, as far as I'm concerned, this can only be a transitory solution to help people survive. States needs to provide a framework for  real strong and cheap \\"credit\\" to all this creative africans. Regular banks failed to do their job because the govs failed to enforce such a basic pre-requisit. We need to take back our governments. Trying to work around the failing ones is not an option. And for me \\"micro finance\\" is one such workaround, that can  be found everywhere in the system. NGO's taking charge of poverty matters are probably the worst effect of this workaround tendancy. Even basic infrastructure are sponsored by all sort of \\"goodwill\\" initiatives. This is nonsense.  I also subcribe to  Dambisa's view on Chinese presence on the continent and again it all boils down to what kind of partner we African are willing to be? Juniors accepting gifts and signing anything submited to us or the main proposition force behind?  People are quick to point to the human and cultural diversity on the continent as a problem, my view is that maybe except for North Africa, the continent is more homogenous humanly and culturaly than most of the big economical integrated groups that I know. We need to take bold steps to undo the colonial bondaries. It's far more costly to keep them than to get rid of them. We should start working seriously toward that goal.    We need to be creative in finding other options to get rid of corrupting aid. From the book the best option we have so far is to convince donors of the sometimes nocivity of their goodwill. This is not enough, we need to design an autonomous alternative to that. We all need to understand it doesn't have to be that way. Our future belongs to us first. We will need to be even more creative in the design of strategies that will help take back our govs.    Overall this is a good reading for any proud african, but also to anyboby willing to have a different spot light on the issue of developpement.    We may have lost the opportunity to plant the trees twenty years ago, but we can still plant plenty of them now.    Cheers,
B000Y7U98C|5.0|SUNSHINE is another excellent film from director Danny Boyle, which is as exciting as it is visually arresting. Almost every shot in the film looks like it could be a beautiful painting. SUNHINE is also a very intense \\"edge of your seat\\" type of thriller. It borrows a lot of elements from the first Alien movie and Boyle's influence is very apparent if you are familiar with his previous film 28 DAYS LATER. I would highly recommend SUNSHINE to anyone who wants an intelligent and exciting cinematic experience to add to their library.

0439023483|2.0|The Hunger Games is one of those painful books, an excellent premise ruined (or almost ruined) by very flawed execution. The story sounds promising: 16-year old Katniss Everdeen (yes, really) is forced to compete in the titular Games, which involves 12 boys and 12 girls fighting to the death on live television. The world that this grisly tournament takes place in is suitably distopyian, and there are a few scenes near the beginning of the book that manage to effortlessly create a sense of tension and unease.     Unfortunately, things go downhill from there. The story is told in first-person present tense, which I'm assuming was meant to leave the reader in doubt as to Katniss's ultimate fate. If that was the case, it didn't work, and I found myself wishing I could take a break from living inside Katniss's head. She isn't the most endearing character in the world, and her frequent (and intrusive) flashbacks do little to flesh out her personality. It doesn't help that the writing can be stilted in places, particularly during the action scenes.    There are further disappointments when we get to see the Games themselves. The other Tributes, or contestants, are mostly given quite sparse characterization, which makes it difficult to care (with a few exceptions) when they start dropping like flies. The pseudo-love triangle between Katniss, her fellow Tribute Peeta and her longtime friend Gale also feels extremely forced and unnecessary, as if the author felt the need to put it in because she thought readers would expect it.    Actually, that explains another of the book's major flaws: it's status as a trilogy. It's painfully obvious throughout that certain plot points won't be explained until future volumes, but the story itself feels as if it should be self-contained. Did we really need the subplot about the Avox girl, which comes out of nowhere and just sits on the page lifelessly for the rest of the book? And what about the Capitol's 'muttations'?     All in all, The Hunger Games feels like wasted potential.
0316017922|4.0|Once again we are amazed at our lack of real understanding of the order of things. Malcolm Gladwell shows us how factors other than what we tend to believe are at work in formulating success. The result of being born in certain months, years, or eras can help to determine the outcome of one's life. Attempts to improve the results of success are usually based on our erroneous assumptions. This fascinating book causes one to reflect on the thinking of the past.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|OK, this album is going to be tough for people looking for that nostalgic feeling those of us have for albums such as De-loused or even Frances the Mute.  The last couple of albums have represented a specific groove in my opinion that has lacked some progression from a \\"feel\\" standpoint.  I personally found that I was almost tired after listening to Bedlam from the onslaught (which I adore about the album).  I mention this only to set the stage for this album.    The time signatures are a much more straight- forward as compared to previous albums.  However, this doesn't mean that there what can be known as the Mars Volta time signatures/riffs aren't here.  The album contains a great psychedelic edge that traverses the soundscape quite well.  Vocals represent a format that is more fluid, less manic, than previous albums, which may be difficult for the first-album fans to buy into.  This, coupled with more breaks in the song structure (fade out guitar riffs for guitar effects over a bass/drum/vocal combo for instance), over a slower BPM, can come as somewhat of a shock for fans.    The soundscapes Mars has provided here are fantastic.  The grooves are no less powerful as well, and in many ways it contains little more edge in its directness (referencing Cotopaxi here, and for those who got picked up the iTune pre-order with the live version have a REAL treat!).  I found the nod to Pink Floyd's \\"time\\" awesome personally.  I haven't seen reviews that picked up on the similarities between Halo and Time.  It also is a great metaphor for the feel that they are trying to incorporate into the music, as well as the influence this style of psychedeia has had on their music.    In summary, I totally disagree with the poor reviews.  This album does not sound like any other album out there, by other bands or Mars Volta themselves.  That's a very good thing, since what secures a bands longevity is whether it can progress as a band.  People tend to get stuck in a form of nostalgia,always looking for that \\"same experience,\\" yet these same people tend to be unable to break out of this old-school vs. new-school paradigm.  If this album was Mars Volta's first album, it would absolutely be recognized as a hit.  Obviously there's a disconnect between what some people expect Mars Volta to produce vs. what Mars Volta (obviously) expects themselves to produce.  This contention has been ongoing since Francis.    For those who are able to appreciate Mars Volta's earlier albums for what they were, and who are interested in hearing how Mars Volta is trying to change up the in-your-face aggressive styling that they have been producing the last couple of albums, I think you will really enjoy this album.  For those who are looking for counter-culture rock and roll will also enjoy this.  However, for those who are looking for a De-loused or Francis the Mute, you may very well find yourself disappointed again.

B00005LIN0|4.0|Although this was filmed for Television in 1993, when wide-screen TV wasn't available yet, there's no excuse for filming this Opera using a narrow (3/4) aspect ratio. Wide screen as such has been with us since the 1920s, and a production of this magnitude near the turn of the century should have had some better vision (in both meanings of the word). a 5-star masterpiece except for this rather disturbing aspect.

B0028SVXR6|4.0|it's hard to think of a band that draws more 'love 'em or hate 'em' attitude than TMV. Personally, I love them, love the noise, the quiet, the risks, the prog rock excess, etc. But I totally get why people hate them. However, in a sterile music scene, the fact that these guys have gotten away with what they've done for FIVE albums on major labels is awesome! This album is more mellow, reflective, contemplative, than previous albums, it strips aways some of the excess of the last two at least. So approach with an open mind, it'd different but i'm impressed. More power to TMV, I will follow them wherever their muse takes them...
B000HIVOI2|5.0|Most older movies on blu-ray are a slight upgrade from DVD at best. Most of the time you get a better looking menu, a few new audio options, and that's about it.

0765348276|5.0|Old Man's War by John Scalzi is an excellent book. I read it in two days, and could barely put it down. Scalzi did a masterful job keeping up the tension and my interest. The novel is written in first person and chronicles the distant future when old men and women are given the opportunity to join the Colonial army and go into space--when they reach the age of the seventy-five. There is a promise of being young again and starting over. No spoilers here. However, I will reveal that there are a lot of aliens out there, and defending the colonies is a huge priority as well as a necessity. Did I mention that it's incredibly dangerous and horrible?<br /><br />The main character, John Perry, gets a lot more than he bargained for after he joins up. I loved seeing his character evolve. It all felt so real and true. The book is written in the tradition of Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers, but is a little more modern. I loved the book, Starship Troopers, and if you liked that, you'll probably enjoy Old Man's War. The spin that Scalzi puts on things is quite fascinating. If you're into military science fiction with strong characters, this is a book for you. Also, if you like Ender's Game, this is also a book you'd probably enjoy.<br /><br />Please note the book is for older teens and adults, related to some off-screen sexual content, and would probably garner a PG-13 rating if it were a movie. I cannot emphasize enough that style of the writing is top-notch, and Scalzi seems quite deserving of all the praise he's gotten for this series, which continues with Ghost Brigades.<br /><br />Happy Reading,<br /><br />Paul Genesse<br />Author of The Dragon Hunters<br />[...]
1428144552|5.0|The product arrived on time in perfect condition. I listen to it as often as possible because the nature of the CD is very similar to pillow speaker therapy of twenty years ago. I am amazed how my life has changed for the better as \\"The Secret\\" permeates my subconscious and I catch myself in viscious cycle thought patterns which are often negative. I believe we are god manifest in flesh and do create every moment of our own lives. Learning how to create more satisfying lives is the object of \\"The Secret\\". Don't give this a cursory leap to judgement. It is very subtle and often missed by highly trained collegiate minds.
B00012QM8G|1.0|For 7/8 of this movie, I was mesmerized. The acting, story, script, cinematography, pacing, everything was absolutely top notch. Wow, I thought, Spielberg is really an amazingly talented guy, not just a sentimental entertainer of children and blockbuster audiences. I'd always had mixed feelings about Spielberg as a director. His entertainments can be very engaging (Jaws, Duel, Raiders of the Lost Ark) when they don't get drowned in sticky-sweet mush a la E.T., but I hated, hated, hated, his prior \\"serious\\" film, The Color Purple. Alice Walker's book had such a sweet, simple ending, with the heroine triumphing over her troubles in a quiet, subtle way. But Spielberg is incapable of such things. Instead of Celie rocking on her porch in her purple pants, he gives us a bunch of people marching around in a sun-drenched field singing--WE'RE HAVING A TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!!!! I HAVE TO DROP CINEMATIC ANVILS ON THE AUDIENCE'S HEAD BECAUSE THEY'RE SOOOO STUPID THEY WON'T OTHERWISE GET THAT WE'RE HAVING A TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT HERE!!!  He did the exact same thing with Schindler's List. This was an intelligent film, written and performed by talented adults for an intelligent adult audience. But does he trust us??? Heaven forbid!! Schindler gives a sappy, completely out-of-character speech at the end, and once again, we've treated to people marching around in a sun-drenched field singing, because we, the audience, are just toooo f--ing stupid to be trusted to know we're experiencing A TRIUMPH OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT!!!!! unless he beats us over the head until we're reduced to a mass of quivering pulp. Immediately my five-star rating dropped to one star because Spielberg showed me he was a brilliant filmmaker and then ruined it because he could not resist the temptation to tell me I'm a moron. I promised myself I'd never see another Spielberg movie and I'm proud to say that's a promise I've kept.     For a brilliantly made, unsentimental but profoundly moving treatment ofthe Holocaust in Poland, see Roman Polanski's \\"The Pianist\\" instead.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|True Romance has always been one of my all time favorite movies. This movie has everything suspense, drama, action, and comedy. It's an excellent transfer in Blu Ray.
B00275EGWO|5.0|I wasn't familiar with director Kathryn Bigelow's work prior to watching Hurt Locker (she directed Point Break, K-19, and others), but I am now a convert.  She directed a brilliant and visceral Iraq war movie, which unlike many of its peers, is also apolitical.  It's not overly preachy (In the Valley of Elah or Stop Loss) or pure action (The Kingdom), but manages to strike its own ground.  The scenes are gritty, shaky;  thankfully the shaky cam/documentary style footage is tastefully done here.   The movie was filmed on location in Jordan, lending to the film's authenticity and immersivity.  The viewer can almost taste the dust in the air, and feel the stares from the unwelcoming populace.  It's the first mainstream movie to highlight the work of bomb defusal technicians , and it's a thankless and extremely hazardous job.  The movie is Black Hawk Down good, albeit on a more intimate level.       The movie follows three members of Bravo Company's Explosive Ordanance Disposal (EOD) squad, as they struggle to finish the last few days of their year long tour of duty.  Everyone copes differently; Specialist Eldridge (Geraghty) is overwhelmed at times with the death that surrounds them, Staff Sergeant James (Renner) is addicted to the rush of battle, and Sergeant Sanborn (Mackie) supports James as best he can.  James is a complex, fascinating and tragic character; he's extremely competent, yet eccentric and even reckless to the point where his teammates consider fragging him in order to make it back alive.  In a thoughtful gesture, he respects the work of his adversaries and keeps all the trigger mechanisms of bombs he has defused in the past.  Every engagement the soldiers experience until their departure affects them, and we see every emotional impact.      Big Hollywood names like Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pearce, and David Morse make short, but memorable appearances.  Even LOST actress Evangelline Lily has an extended cameo as James' wife.  The bomb defusal scenes are nerve-wracklingly tense, and the audience sweats alongside the defusing technician.  The team constantly scans for snipers, or the suspicious civilian about to make a cell phone call to trigger an IED.  The movie does an excellent job of communicating the hazards of the EOD job, and one leaves with a deep appreciation of their work.      6 stars, highly recommended.   It is an action filled, yet contemplative movie.

B0017PCX20|3.0|Most of the other comments are correct when they say these guys sound like Radiohead.  I would add that they also have a sound of Porcupine Tree.  My opinion is that they are better than Radiohead but not as good as Porcupine Tree.  This particular CD is OK but there is nothing exceptional here like you would find in Porcupine Tree.  I was actually not particularly impressed with this CD after hearing some of their other music on Live365.  I would give them another chance but I am hoping that this is not an example of their best music.

B001FB55H6|5.0|When J.J. Abrams took over the Star Trek franchise, he took it in a \\"new direction\\" by alienating the original fanbase and pandering to the lowest common denominator with snooty junior versions of the original characters, gross amounts of product placement, unnecessary and anachronistic Beastie Boys tracks, and a weak attempt to make it \\"Star Wars\\".  This is the same formula that killed any chance of a Lost In Space movie franchise, the whole \\"Screw the old Trekkies, I'll show them how it's done\\" attitude.  Epic fail.<br /><br />Zach Snider, in his infinite wisdom, made a Watchmen movie for the fans that kept it alive for twenty-five years.  That's why I'll be purchasing this in July and watching it many times while the new Star Trek will never grace my media shelves.  Ever.<br /><br />Perfect?  No.  Recommended to persons not familiar with the book?  No, but only because it is excessively long. I would have chosen a different actor for Veidt and made Dr. Manhattan project his voice much more. I can even live with the slightly alternate ending which some of the genius reviewers here are doing a damned fine job of spoiling.<br /><br />Not for the Superman crowd, more for the Batman crowd.<br /><br />Finally...If Alan Moore hates all movies made from his works,  why does he keep selling the film rights to them?

0312427999|1.0|Without getting into too many details, this is made of much blabber that sums up to poor and baseless arguments.  The author consistently fails to understand the essence of the parties for which she argues, thus removing any premise or merit from her theories before even making her argument.<br />This is narrow mindedness dressed up as a broad sophisticated outlook on the organizations running our world.<br /><br />If you are a shallow person who hope to gain an effortless broad perspective and a smart suit by reading the works of a writer that is full of agendas and does poor research and understanding of facts; look no further. Otherwise, don't waste your time - Freakonomics would give you better perspective than this garbage. I kid you not.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I woke up from a nap and there were three text messages on my phone. Nobody ever texts me, so I knew it must have been big news. I thought there was a fire or something. Turned out, Michael Jackson is dead. I was startled, to say the least, because MJ never seemed like the kind of person that could, you know, die. To be honest, he never really registered in my consciousness as being a person; Michael Jackson was the androgynous sexual panic of \\"Billie Jean,\\" the breathless seduction of \\"P.Y.T.,\\" the thrilling kitsch of \\"Thriller,\\" the chattering afro-popisms of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.\\" The idea that he had a human body, one that needed food and air and sleep, never really clicked in my mind. But then again, I guess that's to be expected. I mean, how can a mere human being really be thought to be capable of creating something as monstrous, as mechanical, as all-encompassing, and as awesome as Thriller? This kid wasn't the king of pop; he was the whole damn kingdom. And we, the audience, are not his loyal subjects; we're just reading the travel brochures.<br /><br />The point is, Thriller is one of the greatest moments in the history of pure pop. Which is to say, it's plastic, mass-produced, jugular-grabbingly commercial, and completely unconcerned with originality, artistic merit, or honesty. And goshdarnit, I wouldn't have it any other way! With songs and performances as irresistible and ecstatic as the ones found here, artfulness will only get in the way. Because when you have a song as swooping, as ethereal, as hypnotic, and as unashamedly romantic as \\"Baby Be Mine,\\" there's really no need to question its validity. Just let those labyrinthine keyboards and yearning vocals carry you away to a shiny place. And when \\"Beat It\\" comes roaring out of the gates, it does so with such force and brutal eloquence that you completely forget how absurd it is for Michael Jackson to take on the role of a street-smart hoodlum. As a vision of ghetto reality, it's a nonsensical failure; but the important thing to remember is that, on a purely visceral level, it SOUNDS more convincing and more immediate than its more authentic counterparts.<br /><br />And then there's \\"Billie Jean,\\" whose lyrics are either shockingly amoral or completely uneventful, but which still manages to be one of the most magical, irresistible, and emotionally charged moments in the history of music. And if we found ourselves getting annoyed by the idea of having to root for a child-abandoning father, then we can just remind ourselves that it's only a pop album. An stunning pop album, to be precise.
B00004TR2G|5.0|One of my fav movies since I was 11 when it was released. The soundtrack comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb. The haunting opening horn section gives a premonition of bad things to come. The end title is very soothing and haunting in a melodic way. The action music in between keeps us riveted to certain scenes in the movie. I like the old mid 70's symphony music. Reminds me of alot of action movies and TV shows of that era. This is John Williams #1 masterpiece of his entire career IMO. Main title, Pier incident, Montage, Out to sea and end title are my favs.End title in particular moves me very deeply. The Jaws soundtrack is the soundtrack of summer- everytime I hear it - it reminds me of summertime on the lake.
0446691437|5.0|Knowing the enemy is half of winning any battle, military or creative.  Knowing oneself is the other half.  But  not since Pogo, has any biped also pointed out as incisively and viscerally as Pressfield in 'The War of Art,' the oft-ignored \\"third half\\"--that to meet our enemy is to meet our own dark side.    Pressfield--scriptwriter, taxi-driver, Marine grunt and author of 'The Legend of Bagger Vance'--lays out both the nature of our energy-draining enemy, 'Resistance,' and the methods to defeat this \\"Jaws-Alien-Terminator\\" combo.  But he warns that this is a battle to the death that must be renewed each and every day.     If you're a stumbling writer or struggling artist, inventor or businessman thinking of skipping this 90-minute read, ponder these words from the chapter titled 'The Authentic Self':             Do you have kids?           Then you know that not one of them popped out as tabula rasa, a blank slate.  Each came into this world with a distinct and unique personality, an identity so set that you can fling stardust and great balls of fire at it and not morph it my one micro-dot.  Each kid was who he was.  Even identical twins, constituted of the exact same genetic material, were radically different from Day One and always would be.           . . .[N]one of us are are born as passive generic blobs waiting for the world to stamp its imprint on us.  Instead we show up possessing already a highly refined and individuated soul.           Another way of thinking of it is this:  We're not born with unlimited choices.           We can't be anything we want to be.           We come into this world with a specific, personal destiny.  We have a job to do, a calling to enact, a self to become.  We are who we are from the cradle, and we're stuck with it.           Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we ought to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.           If we were born to paint, it's our job to become apainter.           If we were born to raise and nurture children, it's our job to become a mother.           If we were born to overthrow the order of ignorance and injustice of the world, it's our job to realize it and get down to business.      Sooooo, if this rings at all true to you, your gut, your soul--beg, buy, borrow a copy of this book. And if you just said, 'I don't think I need it,' steal a copy--NOW!  You'll thank yourself in the morning.

B00005QGAT|5.0|In the years before Michael became nothing more then a figure of misguided controversy it was because of his ability to create music such as THIS that he was best known.And it should have and should remain that way. Strictly musically speaking MJ was one of the most important musical figures of his day. For my own purposes in strictly artistic terms this is one of the,if not THE finest original solo album Michael Jackson ever made. Known more often in his ability to sell music it is so often forgotton amidst all that idolotry too many people often forget WHY Michael is still so revered. While this actually counts as Mike's 5'th solo album:1972's [[ASIN:B000025K44 Got to Be There]] and [[ASIN:B000025K47 Ben]],1973's [[ASIN:B000LZAIU6 Music & Me]] and 1975's [[ASIN:B00004S2DP Forever Michael]] had come out on Motown earlier this was his first for Epic. His first historic pairing with Quincy Jones proved to be a high point for both artistically. A good friend of mine baught to the surface the musically influence of Barry White (which Michael admitted freely) on one of this albums best songs  \\"Don't Stop Til You Get Enough\\".It's like a freewheeling musical festival:<br />functions as pop,disco and funk and that is a SUPER RARE achievment.In many ways \\"Rock With You\\" is a lot more...conventional,only in the sense it's much easier to classify but one still cannot deny the sense of creativity and expression of sexual tension in MJ's vocals at all.\\"Working Day And Night\\"...well for those who still don't see how MJ had much to do with funk THIS IS THE MOST OBVIOUS DIRECT ANSWER!!!Paulinho Da Costa's percussion basically makes this song of course and the vocal turns made by Mike on this tune are worthy of a whole albums worth of singing alone. Not a lot of people give \\"Get On The Floor\\" any credit at all since it was never a big \\"hit\\".But the fact is it's one of THE TOUGHEST slices of hard disco-funk of 1979:the rhythms,the BASS! and of course MJ's hot n heavy breathing at the songs breakdown is just raw sweat,energy and drive.Honestly it's one of my favorite tunes on the album.The title song is pretty catchy too.I enjoy the awkward melody but in many ways it does come off as trying too hard to be a hit compared to some of the more driving tunes around it.I can say the same for \\"Girlfriend\\";while the presense of George Duke on keyboards is a big help the Paul McCartney composition (from his and Wings' 1978 album [[ASIN:B00000721I London Town]]) is very poppy in terms of this type of album.Over the years I've warmed to \\"She's Out Of My Life\\"-it really reminds you how much good ol' fasioned,string-filled soul ballads were making a comeback in the late 70's and,infused with the innovation and ambition of the funk era there was this extra new element that baught out a real emotionalism in it. \\"I Can't Help It\\" is another one of my favorite on this album:it's a Stevie Wonder tune and has his songwriting stamp all over it however:Michael's invididuality built around his own musical influences add's his own stamp to it as well;the awkward romanticism of a classic Wonder tune meshes very well with MJ's own sensibilities.\\"It's The Falling In Love\\" is one of the songs here that seems to belong to no genre:it's a little bit jazz,a little light pop and a lot of \\"sweet funk\\".Patti Austin makes an excellent duet partner for him as well.Despite it's title \\"Burn This Disco Out\\" is another of the heavily funky songs here and one of the few songs where you can hear MJ dipping into an almost bass vocal. True MJ took as many chances and risks as possible vocally on this album but that must also be said of it's producer and all of the musicians involved.Artistically speaking if Michael Jackson is to be remembered for any one piece of music this would be an excellent candidate.athing at the songs breakdown is just raw sweat,energy and drive.Honestly it's one of my favorite tunes on the album.The title song is pretty catchy too.I enjoy the awkward melody but in many ways it does come off as trying too hard to be a hit compared to some of the more driving tunes around it.I can say the same for \\"Girlfriend\\";while the presense of George Duke on keyboards is a big help the Paul McCartney composition (from his and Wings' 1978 album [[ASIN:B00000721I London Town]]) is very poppy in terms of this type of album.Over the years I've warmed to \\"She's Out Of My Life\\"-it really reminds you how much good ol' fasioned,string-filled soul ballads were making a comeback in the late 70's and,infused with the innovation and ambition of the funk era there was this extra new element that baught out a real emotionalism in it. \\"I Can't Help It\\" is another one of my favorite on this album:it's a Stevie Wonder tune and has his songwriting stamp all over it however:Michael's invididuality built around his own musical influences add's his own stamp to it as well;the awkward romanticism of a classic Wonder tune meshes very well with MJ's own sensibilities.\\"It's The Falling In Love\\" is one of the songs here that seems to belong to no genre:it's a little bit jazz,a little light pop and a lot of \\"sweet funk\\".Patti Austin makes an excellent duet partner for him as well.Despite it's title \\"Burn This Disco Out\\" is another of the heavily funky songs here and one of the few songs where you can hear MJ dipping into an almost bass vocal.

B0026NWBY2|4.0|While this CD is nicely packaged, and the booklet is well-written, the music on this disc is yet another botched attempt by record company execs' to create a career-spaning item for George Harrison's solo music.    Firstly, why are the BEATLE tunes from the 'Concert for Bangladesh' here?  If some tunes from this disc need inclusion (and they DO)...why not a tune from Harriosn's solo collection?  His fantastic duet of \\"Beware of Darkness\\" with Leon Russell comes to mind.    Secondly, the Dylan tune \\"I Don't Want to Do It\\" does NOT belong here...its uncharacteristically poorly produced, and Harrison himself doesn't sound too enthused about singing this one.  If some Dylan material was to be included (and SHOULD be)...why not the beautifully co-written, produced and performed \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\", that opens side 1 of ATMP ?  Or...Harrison's version of Dylan's \\"If Not For You\\", from same album?    Thirdlly, if this was supposed to be a genuine attempt at a 'career spanning' coverage of GH's work...the songs should be in chronological order!  The Chinese menu \\"one from column A, one from column B\\" approach is rather tacky to say the least.    Lastly, some other solo tunes that would've been nice to include in place of the Dylan tune and the Bangladesh Beatle tunes might have been more 'career spanning in nature.  (ex:  \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\", \\"Faster\\", \\"Soft-Hearted Hanna\\", all from the GH album;  or perhaps \\"Crackerbox Palace\\" from 33&1/3, or \\"Wreck of the Hesperus\\" or \\"Just for Today\\" from Cloud Nine...or \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\" from Material World).        On the + side...all of the true Harrison solo tunes here are wonderful, just as they were on their original discs.  They're well produced (as George would hardly have had them otherwise), well written and performed; again, both characteristiclly Harrison.  And for the price, this is an okay disc if you are a casual, or new fan; but for we long-time lovers of George and his music, this one feels like another cheap and ill-conceived attempt by the record companies to bleed more cash out of our one time hero/icon.    So, if you are looking for a one-disc hodgepodge from Harrison, this one will do, I suppose.  If not, I would recommend his 1989 release of \\"Best of Dark Horse\\" for a partial collection of his solo material (then add discs such as \\"Cloud Nine\\", \\"Brainwashed\\", and the two Traveling Wilbury ones to complete the circle.  For his earlier material, buy ATMP and the Concert for Bangladesh, if you don't already have them.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|What can you say about two rock legends ? Awesome , spectacular ,great , immortal ! Simply the best ! The music is fantastic , Winwood and Clapton are without a doubt fantastic . A must have . Best album i have heard in years .
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I've just had the pleasure of listing to this 2 disc set for the first of many times to come.  Hearing Clapton and Winwood together again was suberbly nostalgic for me!  I was inspired enough to dig out my \\"Blind Faith\\" cd and re-listen to many of the tunes included here in their original package.  And while I agree with another reviewer here that the energy level on this set of discs isn't what it was on the \\"Blind Faith\\" one...just consider the difference in Clapton and Winwood's ages NOW...being in my mid 50s, I can well appreciate them not being as 'electrified' or as 'energetic' 40 years later!  That said, the signature guitar work from both, along with Winwood's touch at the keyboard come sparkling through on tune after tune.  And who could fail to appreciate the wonderful, BLUESY quality that sustains and keeps the listener's attention and respect?  They may not have quite as much 'fire' as in their salad days, but both of these guys can still deliver with plenty enough octane to satisfy most any long-time fan of either or both.  I recommend this disc set highly and without reservation to anyone who appreciates the Blues and/or the Rock genres.
B00004W5A6|2.0|I've got about 30 SACD's now to complement the other 1,500 normal CD's.  When I want really well-defined sound I often go for the SACD's.  Unfortunately, this SRV disc is not that well engineered, as are a few others I own, and it is not really worth the extra money for the SACD version.<br /><br />One would like to think that any SACD you purchase will be seat-of-the-pants better than it's normal CD counterpart, but that is not the case with this one.  Not all SACD's sound superior to their CD mates, unfortunately, so let the buyer beware.

This CD is an excellent quality release.  A George Harrison release or re-release has been long overdue and this fits the bill nicely.  Unlike the half dozen recycled \\"Best Of\\" John Lennon CDs currently on the market, I rate this Harrison release as reasonably original.  At least there is no blatant attempt to market a slapped together rehash CD.<br /><br />In summary:  Nice selection of tracks, great quality, booklet included, and you cannot beat the price.  The only missed opportunity was for an additional one or two CDs to complete the \\"anthology.\\"<br /><br />LET IT ROLL contains 19 tracks all of which have been remastered.  The selection of music is curious as is is sprinkled with tracks from ALL THINGS MUST PASS, LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, GEORGE HARRISON, SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND, CLOUD NINE, and BRAINWASHED.  Inexplicably the CD ignores music from DARK HORSE, EXTRA TEXTURE, and GONE TROPPO albums.  The CD also boasts live performances of While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Something, and Here Comes the Sun.<br /><br />I was originally hopeful that an updated version of THE BEST OF DARK HORSE 1976 - 1989 would have been released as a companion to the original BEST OF GEORGE HARRISON CD.  My old cassette version, though surviving a 1991 military deployment to Southwest Asia, has long since gone missing.  One of the greatest attributes of BEST OF DARK HORSE was that it contained 'Cheer Down,' which was the only album where that song could be found -- excepting the subsequent live album.  Never fear, LET IT ROLL includes 'Cheer Down.'<br /><br />Three tracks from Harrison's final album BRAINWASHED also appear on this CD.  BRAINWASHED was a very good album that was unfortunately stopped in its digital tracks by George's untimely passing.  As such it is very appropriate for some of these great numbers to appear again.<br /><br />As with most compilation albums/CDs there will always be people who are somewhat disappointed that their favorites did not make the final cut.  Believe me, I feel the same way.  It is likely that no two George Harrison fans will ever agree on what tracks should comprise a \\"Best Of\\" or anthology release.  So be it.  LET IT ROLL is a great start.  Hopefully there will be other releases that will eventually comprise an anthology release.s with most compilation albums/CDs there will always be people who are somewhat disappointed that their favorites did not make the final cut.

0385512058|5.0|This should be required reading for all past, present and future people interested in having a great fulfilling life.  No matter what your chosen field may be, it shows you  life should be about caring and sharing in your family, your friendships and your work environment.  If we all had these values set in our minds, every business, school, household, church, government,etc.; would be so much better. Helping each other to obtain whatever goals we have set would be possible.  Modern day version of the old \\"Do unto others\\" commandment.
B00003CWL6|1.0|The film begins with a young girl talking about her Dad. \\"Do you want me to kill him?\\" This tells you it will be a sicko movie! Then we see a street with a voice from a man with psychological problems. There are weird neighbors for this strange family. Lester has a job in advertising (professional lying?); is he expendable? There is conflict at the dinner table. \\"What happened?\\" Carolyn is in real estate sales, she has lookers not buyers. [Are her emotions embarrassing?] Jane is a cheerleader with emotional problems. Lester has a fantasy; is he pathetic? Does Angela have a problem too? Is a neighbor a voyeur? \\"Oh, gross!\\" Are the other neighbors strange? What's their business? [Does it seem like a cartoon drama?] The character of Angela is displayed as if to suggest future failure. Is their conversation real? Does Ricky look too old for high school?    The film runs on with conversations that seem weird. What kind of job does Ricky have? Why is Angela so friendly? Are their conversations real? Does the story drag on? [Did people really sit through this movie?] Why is Ricky being tested? Would a dealer trust a new customer? Is Lester slowly going crazy? Can you believe this story? Its like a life of people who will show up on \\"Jerry Springer\\" or some other freak show. Is there a cure for being stressed out? [Another unbelievable scene?] Why would anyone be scared of Ricky, the friendly neighborhood dope dealer? They show a video that is more boring than this movie. Pathetic? Does the dinner conversation seem unreal? Lester doesn't recognize the music! Spaced out? The film continues to drag on, testing the viewer's patience.    Mister Fitts bursts into his son's room for a violent confrontation. [Did it wake you up?] \\"There are rules in life.\\" Another embarrassing scene follows. Carolyn takes up a new hobby; she has that freedom. [I sense a tragedy about to happen.] Is the film going downhill? Is Lester cracking up? Are Jane and Ricky having problems? Will they plan afelony? [Does it seem real?] Can a family be that sick? [The film heads to a crisis.] The framing of scenes is suggestive. [Does it satisfy the hidden desires of the writer?] Are the actions of Jane believable? Or the speeches? Is the writer just creating his fantasies? Does Angela seem credible or a victim of sexual abuse? Is Lester credible in his act? Will a romantic triangle end in violence, like some operatic tragedy? Does the writer avoid the logical conclusion of his story? Is the ending as stupid as the preceding film?    I wonder how much of a pay-off is needed to buy great reviews for this film? [Local newspaper reviewers used to praise the films shown by its advertisers.] I did not find it moving or funny, did you? Is it designed to demoralize the viewing public? Does this movie suggest that people in advertising are sick mentally? What about the writer and producers?
B001UE276A|5.0|This is without a doubt, the most complete box set for Depeche Mode's new album! Initially, I was unsure if it would be worth the extra money, but I can tell you that if you are a Depeche Mode fan, it is definitely worth every penny. I was most impressed with the DVD because it has loads of short films. An excellent value here! The two books are excellent pieces of work too. If you enjoy Depeche Mode's \\"The Sounds Of The Universe\\" album, this deluxe box set will not disappoint you.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is a love story of a dirty diractive robot named Wall-E and a sleeker, fancier robot named Eve. Wall-E's only function is to pick up trash on a future earth that has been damaged and contaminated so badly that humans have evacuated to an outerspace utopia to wait for the Earth to be decontaminated, Wall-E has a pet cockroach for crying out loud. By his nature, Wall-E is a curious thing and is attracted instantly to Eve because of her sleek and mysterious ways. Together, they mount a quest to show the captain of the space habitat that life can now be sustained on Earth and face a number of challenges including an army of robot police enlisted by a robot population that has no desire to return home and years of built up human apathy.    Beneath the children's feel good message though, are serious adult undertones. On the ship where the Earth's residents are being housed, they have become obese pigs because everything is handed directly to them, they hardly ever have to get up to exercise or any other physical activity and have virtual entertainment activities pumped to them through simulated screens. This could be easily read as a commentary or at the very least a parallel to modern American society.

0385340575|5.0|There are plenty of reviews here to tell you what this book's plot is about so I'll leave that alone.    I've read the entire series and a case can be made that this is the best of the lot. It's taut, and just plain scary, the kind of book that can make you feel like you are in two places at once: the shadowy mountains from which came true mystery, and the streets of New York, described brilliantly. No fictional Colorado town filled with zombies. A real breathing city polluted by terrorism and the minions of government agencies (but not by the generally smarter NYPD) that raise serious questions about what our foreign meddling and post-9-11 world has truly wrought. This is also a more insightful, vulnerable and mature Reacher. And, one not devoid of quick witted humor.      So, it kept me up at night and the next morning, after a tad of coffee and breakfast I went back to bed, curled up, and spent a couple of hours knocking it off. Well sort of, I had to return to the pillow later in the day for the last chapter. First time ever. We guys who work out of the house can do that.

B001CD6FKI|5.0|Speed Racer did not get very good reviews from the critics upon it's release, but it truely is a fun movie. It is exactly like the cartoon in so many ways, and the actors and actresses truely understand the innocence that Speed Racer embodies. Almost every scene is so visually fantastic that you almost feel like you are watching a cartoon.  The differences in the film are not that apparent. The female characters, such as Mom Racer and Trixie, have much bigger parts. The cartoon was always filled with a kind of subtle misogyny that (thankfully) the Wachowski Bros. corrected by making Mom and Trixie so important to the plot and to Speed. There is a much better plot in the film than most episodes of the cartoon series. I'm not going to lie, the plot is not intellectually stimulating. The little guy v. Big Business isn't a new story and won't leave you with a lot of deep thoughts. What it will leave you with is two and a half hours worth of rooting for the little guy and screaming at the top of your lungs.    I love Speed Racer.

B001FB4W0W|1.0|This show was really terrible. If you like the books don't waste your time. I was really looking forward to seeing this (I have all of the books) and I am so glad I rented it at our Blockbuster instead of buying it. I watched several episodes to be sure it was bad because I really wanted to like it. (discs 2,3 and 5). Lots and Lots (way too much) sex and Nudity. It's basically the whole story with this t.v. show.
B00006I53S|2.0|I've owned one of these for about 5 years and through usage it doesnt seem to focus from side to side. I've chalked this up to wear so I ordered another one but when it arrived the auto focus motor was frozen so I sent it back and rented a 24 to 70 L series lens from Lens Giant for a month.  Wow, it is great but the price is 3 times the 28-135mm.  The 28-135 is a good lens at f.8 and above at short distance.  Not so good wide open with large groups such as wedding party altar shots.  I'm still debating on what to by but I think it will be an L series.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|This album is the biggest selling album of all time for a reason- it is a distillation of practically all the known musical genres and bottled into one easily digestible product. Billie Jean has to be one of the greatest songs of all time, Quincy Jones production can not be touched,the song is a work of art, an aural sculpture and Michael's performance on the Motown's 25th anniversary celebration just hit it out of the park. Unfortunately he never reached the heights again. It would be like given the key to the secret of life what else is there left to do? Michael Jackson really died a long time ago-the white apparition who passed away recently was really just a ghost of what was the King of Pop

I loved this one too![[ASIN:B00004XMTJ Cats - The Musical (Commemorative Edition)]]
B00260HH3K|1.0|This movie truly is horrible. The story was poorly translated and, the action was absolutely nothing stellar. Truly  a waste of time. This was a series created in the 1980s with exceptional stoy telling and action scenes, This is 2009 in the USA  and the movie certainly did not match up to the show's charisma, that captivated millions, at all. Which is why it was pulled  out of theaters and got the poor treatment by majority of fans and others, which it deserved. A VERY cliche and rushed storyline. Dragonball Evolution was child abuse, it felt like it was written by the director's five year with crayola crayons. Seriously the dialogu, even for a PG rated movie was PRETTY CHEESY. This movie is like the demon child of Power Rangers and High School Musical (Without the music.) You really should save your money for something truly worthwhile and has a shred of effort put into it.

B0000025RI|5.0|I'm writing this on the day of Michael Jackson's Death; 6/25/09. I figured this is the best way to leave a tribute to him. This album was one of the first real music albums when I was a kid that encouraged me to leave behind kid's Disney records and the soundtrack to Star Wars. I taped a copy of Thriller from my sister's record since my parents were too cheap to buy me my own record. I remember I listened to it about a thousand times in the back of the early 80's Chevy Caprice Classic station wagon on the way to our vacations. I remember the faster songs were wild to me, especially Beat It with the Van Halen guitar solo, while the slower songs always made me drift off to sleep. This is still a great album, and what it did for me personally was break the hold of kiddie music and encourage me to start seeing what else was out there. Before long I found Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and Twisted Sister (remember, this was the early-mid 80's!) and I have Michael Jackson to thank for providing the nudge I needed to begin on my way. That's what Michael Jackson and Thriller mean to me. I purposely don't listen to it very often these days, so that when I do, the memories are still powerful and I have not gotten bored with it.
B00006BTCA|5.0|man, i love this band! i saw them live in nashville a few years ago, they ripped the house apart. i was intorduced to them by a friend back in 2002. a re-invention of NewWave does not get any better than this. the only bands that can compete are the Killers and the Strokes.  Interpol took new york back to its roots of the late 70s & early 80s when things were all about the CBGB scene & style........  if you can dig, then dig it all, my love my Interpol.  Punk once again meets NewWave or should i dare say Neo-NewWave.    Carstereo Ratliff
4770030088|4.0|I was a little hesitant at the begining, because I did not see kanji or a lot of japanese characters, but decided to buy the book with the CD anyway. I have been following the book in partnership with a friend from Japan over the internet who has the same book, and is working very well for me. We have only about 30 minutes sessions 4 or 5 times a week and I can easily read and do the excercises on my own after the online sessions. I recommend the book for somebody who wants to get the basics. This is not an advanced training but it will give you the essentials to start communicating in japanese.
1400082773|5.0|My paperback edition has a cover quote from Marian Wright Edelman: \\"Perceptive and wise, this book will tell you something about yourself whether you are black or white.\\" How true! This is one of the best books I have ever read. This is a deep writer. His phrasing and storytelling are captivating. As a man whose father did not spend much time with him, I found a lot of my feelings in this book. I don't know if a woman would find familiar ground.    I found the chapters on Chicago most interesting in terms of watching his growth. I also was spellbound when, later, he stood in Kenya looking at his father's and grandfather's graves (side-by-side). I am in awe of this man's journey.

I am not sure I will be ordering his other music, but this will be in my summer spinning for sure!!!

B001FB55HG|2.0|It's funny how for years Terminator fans have been arguing over which of the first two films is the best.  Now they can argue over which of the last two films is the worst!    Christian Bale is the third incarnation of the character John Connor and people are pointing out that it isn't his best performance.  In my judgement he's a step above the last person who was John Connor but he's still too one dimensional for my tastes.  Ironically though, the most interesting part of Christian Bale's involvement in the character was the disturbing and strangely funny outburst he had off screen with one of the directors while they were filming a scene.  As I watched Salvation I found myself wondering which scene they were filming when Bale went ballistic.  I really want to know.    On the plot, it is frustrating how in this fourth Terminator movie John Connor is STILL trying to save his own existence.  Apparently, Skynet knows Kyle Reese is the future father of John Connor but how in the world do they know this?  They try to terminate Kyle because I guess since their attempt to kill John's mother didn't work they figured they would try to kill his father this time?  Then why didn't the T-800 from the first terminator movie also try to kill Kyle as well?  Or better yet why did Skynet even send back a terminator machine to 1984 since the threat from the machine is what gets Kyle Reese and Sarah Connor together? I'm not sure if I can wrap my head around this.  Bottom line is they're just going through the same old idea and it doesn't even make sense this time.  I would have to say that my least favorite character in the whole Terminator franchise is John Connor because his importance has been shoved down my throat too many times.  When is he going to do something useful?    The character Marcus is getting a lot of praise and, rather than repeating what has been said, I'll just say that Sam Worthington does give a worthy performance.    Besides this there are two brief cameos thatshould be mentioned.  Linda Hamilton is in the movie (sort of) as John listens to her old audio recordings that she started at the end of the first terminator movie.  But did anyone else notice that she sounds way too old?  At the time of the recordings she's supposed to be twentyish but she sounds like 50.    The best thing about the movie was the too brief confrontation between Arnold Schwartzenegger (how he looked from the first terminator movie) and John Connor as he tries to rescue his dad from being terminated.  I read that some people didn't like this CGI Arnold but I thought it looked really good.  Does it make it worth seeing in the theatre or buying it on DVD?  I doubt it.  Just find that scene on youtube and favorite it.
B001NMAFXQ|5.0|Okay, first of all, don't make fun of my incredibly cheesy review title, because IT'S FITTING! I have been listening to this band for almost a year now thanks to Pandora and I have not yet heard one song come out of this band that wasn't absolutely and ridiculously awesome :D This album's levels of amazingness shine through several angles, I mean how could it not, it was produced by Chad from NFG and the almighty Adam of Killswitch! I could honestly sit here and go on and on about how great they are, but I just want to tell you, this album is worth listening to from start to finish, and then put it all on repeat a couple times, then several more (yea, it's that good!)
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Thjere are many Michael Jackson CD's on the market. This is the one to own however since it captures all of his big hits and well represents my two favorite albums \\"Off The Wall\\" and \\"Thriller\\". His best songs are all here\\" Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Beat It, Billie Jean,The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, etc. as well as his early hits with the Jackson Five and the great later albums like \\"Bad\\" and \\"Dangerous\\". THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING representation of these hits I have ever heard. There are 37 cuts. Michael was indeed an American tragedy and a pop music icon. If you can only own one CD, this is the most logical choice. My only quibble is the omission of \\"Never Can Say Goodbye\\" which was my favorite Jackson Five song. At one time, he was selling over one million albums-CD's a day (1983-84). He changed the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics. Highly recommended!
B00003CX9E|1.0|This is supposed to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, film ever created. I found it to be incredibly boring. Kane himself is an interesting character, but the story takes too long to develop. It drags out and leaves you wanting much more, much quicker. I'm no film buff, so I'm sure I missed all kinds of symbolism etc, but this movies just didn't do it for me. If your looking for an entertaining classic, I'd try Ben Hur or Cool Hand Luke.

B000CNESU8|5.0|When Paddy Chayefsky's \\"Network\\" opened in theaters back in 1976 it created quite a stir all across America. \\"Network\\" boasted an all-star cast that included such luminaries as William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, Robert Duvall and Ned Beatty,  \\"Network\\" tells the story of the fledgling UBS network which due to insipid programming and increasingly lackluster ratings was widely considered to be an industry joke.  The ratings for \\"The UBS Evening News with Howard Beale\\" had been in freefall for quite some time and the network had quietly determined that its longtime anchor (played by Peter Finch) must be jettisoned and replaced by a younger, more vigorous individual.  It would fall upon Mr. Beale's best friend and head of the News Division Max Schumacher (William Holden) to break the news. To put it mildly, Howard Beale does not take this devastating news very well.  He promptly announces on the air that he intends to kill himself.  Furthermore, he indicates that he will do the deed on live television!  Beale is immediately taken off the air but the network ultimately allows him to return to the airwaves one last time to make a brief farewell statement.  Rather than merely saying goodbye Beale launches into an impassioned rant and declares that \\"life is bull----\\" .  Clearly this ex-anchor had done gone crazy!<br /><br />But not so fast!  UBS is bombarded with phone calls and telegrams.  Incredibly, Beale's diatribe had struck a nerve with the audience and sparked renewed interest in his newscast.  Enter the new head of UBS's entertainment division, a brash young woman named Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway).  Christensen is convinced that the only way to revive UBS is to offer counter-culture programming. She enters into a power struggle with Max Schumacher for control of the nightly news and convinces the network to give Beale another shot.  But what Diana Christensen has in mind is unlike any newscast anyone had ever seen before.  Diana soon gets her way and promptly makes drastic changes to the newscast.  The program is now called \\"The Howard Beale Show\\" and Beale is given virtually free reign to rant and rave on virtually any topic he sees fit.  One of those rants \\"I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\\" has become one of the most famous lines in motion picture history.  Other features are added to the show including a soothsayer and a pop culture segment called \\"Vox Populi\\".  Clearly the Entertainment division has gained control of the newscast much to the chagrin of Max Schumacher and his colleagues in the News Division.  Much of the remainder of this film focuses on the internal power struggle among the various factions for control of the network and on the complicated personal and professional relationship between Ms. Christensen and Max Schumacher.  Fascinating stuff!<br /><br />Now why am I urging everyone under the age of 30 to make it a point to see \\"Network\\"?  I guess it's because these folks probably never got to experience network news the way it used to be.  Back in the day network newscasts were pretty straightforward and largely unbiased.  You really had no idea what the politics of the anchor and the correspondents were.  That is the way it should be.  Keep in mind that \\"Network\\" was a fantasy.  Yet it seems clear that more than 30 years ago Paddy Chayefsky had a vision of what broadcast journalism might one day become.  I doubt that anyone who viewed \\"Network\\" over thirty years ago could have ever imagined that network news programs would one day devolve into what they have become today.<br /><br />\\"Network\\" remains one of my favorite movies of all-time.  There are many memorable performances in this film including those of Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall and most especially William Holden.  Obviously, I would be remiss if I failed to mention the courageous performance of Albert Finch in the role of Howard Beale.  Mr. Finch was quite ill at the time \\"Network\\" was filmed and would pass awaya short time later.  Very highly recommended.a short time later.  Very highly recommended.
0439813786|5.0|I've spent the past couple of weeks reading this book to my 6- and 7-year-old boys at bedtime.  What a magical story!  All three of us enjoyed it immensely.  Of special note:  My 6-year-old has never enjoyed read-aloud time much at all (though my 7-year-old has enjoyed it since birth).  This was the very first book that captivated him and had him begging me to read to him.  I was really impressed.  The book is quite long (although the majority of it is told in pictures) and I was sure he would lose interest along the way but he didn't!  I really enjoyed the bit of historical fiction included about Georges Melies and it helped me appreciate the story that much more.  I highly recommend this as a wonderful family book!
B0026NWBY2|5.0|For a man whose personal philosophy was really an open-ended journey into higher consciousness, it is sadly ironic that so many of the reviews for this excellent career-spanning collection are so remarkably contentious with recriminations flowing through song selection, sequence and an alleged oversampling from a very narrow band of his work - specifically, All Things Must Pass and The Concert for Bangladesh. It is at times like this that I am reminded of Steely Dan's perceptive take on the vagaries of radio playlists.... \\"Nothing but Blues and Elvis and somebody else's favorite song.\\"    Maybe this type of friction is unavoidable and just maybe, there is no more fitting tribute to such an introspective artist that our own personal soundtracks of what constitutes his best work are so subjective.    By its very nature a single-disc \\"best of\\" compilation is designed to present an overview of the high water marks, inviting the listener to dig deeper into individual titles if they so choose. If George's family had elected to include Wawa, Crackerbox Palace and/or Apple Scruffs it goes without saying that they would have felt right at home however, their exclusion does not compromise this fine work in any way. Personally, I would have loved to see Dark Horse or Living In The Material World... so what!    It is obvious that between the painstaking remastering and the excellent 28-page booklet that accompanies the release that this record was a labor of love for all involved - I am sure that's all George would have asked. Let It Roll - The Songs of George Harrison is absolutely essential.

B001PA0FFO|3.0|Before watching this film, I read a critic that called it Oscar bait. I wasn't quite sure what he meant. I suppose people shouting impassioned arguments at each other while holding back tears is what he meant. The thing is, there's nothing new here. There's nothing new about a priest that (possibly) had improper relations with a young altar boy. There's nothing new about the clash of the old ways and new ways in the Church. The only new thing I saw was the great (and short) performance by Viola Davis as she was willing to let quite a lot pass for the sake of her son. Meryl Streep is yet again amazing at keeping in character so that we firmly believe she is a real person and not just a stage character. The movie ends too soon. There is punishingly little understanding from the POV of the young African American child who should be the center of this entire production. The most we get out of him is a few lines and a lot of scowling and sniffling. I wanted to know more about him. How does he feel to be in a an all white school. How does he feel about the Priest, really? How does he feel about his father who beats him. The lack of a climax to the story leaves the viewer a bit underwhelmed and cheated even.   The Bronx set (I had no idea where it was. It could have been Boston for all I knew) was great reminiscent of the autumnal images evoked in the Exorcist. I wish there could have been more speculation about the cause of the raging winds in addition to the Priest's low-key speech at the last service in the film.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|The product gives you the option of using either HD or standard by simply turning the disc over.  My husband loves the quality.  It is a little difficult to navigate to the show, but not to deter from the overall enjoyment of the show.
B0014NDXGA|1.0|The Bushnell Tour V2 is easy to use and accurate......when it is working.  I bought a different brand altogether because the Bushnell ate batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Also, my batteries were hard to replace because the cover didn't screw on.  You had to use a coin to open and close.  Would not recommend.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is easily one of my favorite books in the past few years. I was given a first edition hardcover (signed!) as a wedding gift; I promptly devoured it.<br /><br />I recently encouraged my wife to read it. I loaned the hardcover to her, and decided to try out the iPhone Kindle app with this book. This way, we could read it \\"together\\", without time-sharing.<br /><br />The Kindle edition is missing punctuation left and right, and there is the occasional missing space between two words. It's quite jarring. I don't know how this slipped by the editors for this electronic version, but it's sloppy. It's a shame that such a great story is anchored down by a poor 'translation', for lack of a better term.<br /><br />It's quite easy to find an example; just pick a location randomly. Ah, here we are... from the first part of Timothy Cavendish, \\"The old stained-glass door had been replaced by something more burglarproof That reading week I'd entered Dockery ready to peel off...\\" (the second sentence continues on for a bit.) Mind you, this is but ONE of hundreds of examples.<br /><br />Thank goodness that Mr. Mitchell capitalizes the first letter of each sentence. Further, thank goodness that I could grasp where punctuation belonged with the context. Neither of these points excuse sloppy editing.<br /><br />5 stars (more if I could!) for the material. 1 star for the editing. 2 stars for this review. (I realize 5 and 1 average to 3, but I'm weighting the editing heavily.)<br /><br />Read the book; skip the Kindle.
B001R3YRFS|4.0|What can you say about this film that hasn't already been said in previous reviews?  Great film about a normal guy who snaps.<br /><br />I'm not going to waste my time talking about the movie it's a must see.  What I am here to talk about is the great Blu ray that Warner Brothers has put out.<br /><br />Lets talk about the package first, it's not a typical plastic case but a hardcover book.  It's about the same thickness as a BR case but a tad bigger.  The pages vary in content from pre to post production.  You also get some very nice full color pictures.<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc; The transfer is great.  I was really surprised when I put the movie in, very clear transfer with very little grain.<br /><br />The sound is where things get a bit disappointing, only a 2.0 track is available.  It still sounds good, but definitely could benefit from a 5.1 option.<br /><br />The extras are meek, but this time around it's quality and not quantity.  First of all you get two seperate commentaries with the director Schumacher and star Douglas.  There's a 10 minute featurette called \\"A Discussion with Michael Douglas\\" where the actor recants on his experiences with making the film.  Rounding out the disc is the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />This disc comes highly recommended.  Great step up from the previously released DVD!
1428144552|5.0|I have seen this movie, and read the book.  The audio, in my opinion, is the most powerful. Why?<br />first, the author's voice is magical.  I listen to a lot of audio tapes, and hers is 100 % pleasing and perfect.  Next, your attention is completely focused on the words..  instead of watching the video..  or ..sometimes as I'm reading a book, my attention will stray..  I like that I can repeat the sections of the audio over and over<br />I feel empowered, energized, and in fact I'm giving this immediately to a loved relative, and buying another for myself.  I feel this is a Bible.<br /><br />These are principles I have always known, and always read about in other fields such as finance etc..  But this disc series is either the most well done, or it is the most timely for me. I don't know.  (I have experienced visualizing success .. over  my life.  Good things such as good health, just about the exact car I wanted and the qualities in a tenant.. and even my house which I essentially bought without money of my own by doing things other people said were impossible.  Called all of these to myself by being totally  explicit and detailed in what I wanted. )
B00164GDD2|4.0|For this review I'm not going to really go into the movie.  Most people have seen this movie or at least have an idea about it.  It's one of the best comedies from the 80's.<br /><br />I've owned this movie on every format, VHS when I was a kid...DVD, and now the Blu Ray.<br /><br />Lets talk about the most important thing first, the transfer.  While it is a step up from the DVD, I still feel like it could have been a lot better.  The film seems way too bright in some scenes, the contrast is definitely off.  It's not horrible, it's definitely the best transfer so far albeit only a small step up from the DVD.<br /><br />Unlike the picture I'd say the audio is near perfect.  This movie hasn't sounded this great in a long time.  Everything is spot on from the ghosts to the proton packs.  I was really impressed with the sound mix.<br /><br />Now onto the special features.  First up is the commentary from Ivan Reitman and Harold Ramis, this was recorded back in 1999 but is still a great listen.<br /><br />You also get 10 deleted scenes and a handful of featurettes ranging from the making of the film to interviews with the actors.  Rounding out the disc you have a collection of various trailers.<br /><br />Up last is the exclusive HD content.  Various BD live content from chats, to trailers, to ringtones.  You get a few more featurettes, the most interesting being about the Ecto-1, and last you get a few PIP features like Slimer mode which plays interview clips during the film.<br /><br />Although the transfer isn't the greatest I'd say this is a worthy upgrade especially at the price.  Go ahead and trade in your vhs and dvds, this is the only one you'll need to own.
1558216340|3.0|This is an extremely gripping and truly amazing tale - but the fact that it may well be largely a work of fiction, rather than a true account, means I have had to give it only 3 stars. I don't agree with claiming something is true, when it isn't.    I only found out that the book might not be genuine after I finished reading it. I was disappointed; to discover something is not genuine definitely takes value away from the story.    It's still a great read - and I wish it was true - but there does seem to be a lot of evidence which suggests the much of the account is a work of fiction, not fact.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Boy, the visuals were as stunning as I had read they were; absolutely spectacular. I hate to use this cliché, but this is a \\"must\\" for Blu-Ray fans. You have to see - and hear - this film in HD because it is a great treat for your senses. The surround sounds are everywhere while the colors and artwork are something to behold! And, yes - it's still very pretty on a regular DVD, too.    The story is \\"cute,\\" but nowhere near the visuals and audio. It's okay, subtlety humorous, dramatic and romantic parts. It gets a tiny bit preachy with the usual environmental digs and a comment about how fat we humans can get by lying around too much, but otherwise just plays it for comedy and cool-looking characters. Everyone and everything in this film is pretty amazing-looking.    It's kind of a strange story, with much of it taking place on a big space ship. My favorite parts were in the beginning on Earth with the little robot WALL-E and his cockroach friend.    There is so much to see in this film, it makes multiple viewings all the more attractive but, I'll assume, you're always going to catch some things you didn't see the first few times.
0446402389|2.0|I won't give any of the plot or action away, since it is a thriller, but I will say that I was entranced with the first third of the book - from its setting, to the almost palpable sense of paranoia and claustrophobia, it was a remarkable piece of writing - especially for a first-time novelist. (Although it turns out the author did some very famous folks shepherding him, including the guy who wrote the Chinatown screenplay).   I found myself insisting my friends should read my copy as soon as I finished.    But the longer the book went on, the less impressive it became; the writing, the plotting, and the characters were increasingly more predictable ...dare I say, more Hollywood-like?  (Curse you, William Goldman, for your pernicious influence!)    So in the end, I'll say it's barely recommendable - probably would've given it 3 stars, but I'll have to dock it a star for the way the latter half of the book betrayed the promise of the first half.
B000068TPN|3.0|With the cast, and hype of this film at the time of its release, I expected something more, something akin to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".....but it wasn't to be.....although this DVD wouldn't be part of my collection if I didn't like it. Also, I hear the Blu-Ray version is excellent so that's tempting to buy.    \\"We Were Soldiers\\" had things I appreciated that are rare in today's action films: 1 - a pro-military film concerning a Viet Nam war battle; 2- fairly tame language. This is not pro-Viet Nam War.  Hollywood would never do that, but at least it shows the soldiers in a solid, valiant light. It's also refreshing to see good references to God and prayer.    It's  this film that I thought the violence was overdone, not \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  The action here doesn't start for 40 minutes, but when it does it loud, it's heavy and it's continuous over most of the next 95 minutes.Shorter periods of the violent scenes would have made this much better, maybe even an \\"excellent\\" film.    Madeline Stowe had a memorable scene delivering message of war deaths to their spouses. That was touching stuff. But, mostly, this is an action film and the battle scenes are gruesome at times, particularly near the end of the film.
1400063736|5.0|Review-Colim McCann, Let the Great World Spin  In Let the Great World Spin, Colim McCann takes the vision of a man walking on air 110 stories above the ground and recreates a moment in time in 1974.  Many seemingly unrelated characters are living their lives in New York as the tightrope walker makes his trip.  By the end of the novel, McCann has woven the threads of their lives and the times effortlessly into a loving portrait of a city.  McCann's characters, as diverse as an Irish monk, a black prostitute, a Jewish judge, his upper class wife, both destroyed by the loss of their son, Joshua in Vietnam, the nerdy computer programmers working near the Towers, the other women of the group who lost their sons in Vietnam, the tightrope walker himself, leap off the page.    The novel resonates in the reader long after the last page is turned.  Triumphant, exuberant, uplifting.  Run right out and buy it today.
B000PXUA5W|2.0|I would not recommend this watch if you want a \\"real\\" watch.  It is cheaply made and more of a toy than a watch.  It falls apart easily.  I bought this for my 5 year grandson as his first watch and probably should have gotten something that would stay together.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I thought the Dualshock was the perfect ergonomic controller design. It is, but this makes it more...well...ergonomicker.  There isn't much to say other than they do their job.  I recommend it for any game, not just racing or FPS.    Word of warning, if you're having trouble putting them on, you have to push them down pretty good until they click. I wasn't pushing down hard enough at first and started to get a little distressed.  But once you have them locked on they stay on no problem. Another word of warning - they could be awkward if you use your middle fingers for L2/R2 as mentioned in a previous review.  I think they're best designed for those who, like me, use their index fingers to switch between L1/L2 and R1/R2.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This book was even better than James Bond.  I've never read a book more exhilerating than this.  It takes you into the book from the first page and keeps you inside until the last page.  If you want a suspensful and thrilling book, this is your only choice!
0739383728|5.0|I loved listening to this CD in my car as I drove throughout Los Angeles. I didn't want it to end. This book changed my life. It invigorated my running practice, had me to question prevailing wisdom, and introduced me to real-life people, who's triumphs and tragedies moved me spiritually and physically.  Only read/listen to this book if you wish to grow as a person and as an athlete. A ga-gillion stars!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have read all of the books that the series is based off of and one can be certain that the series does NOT match the books at all.  However, I have truly loved the inventive way the series has spun off of the books and come to life.  It gives me a secondary fantasy adventure that may not follow the plotline I am familar with, but still does a damn good job in entertaining the viewer.<br /><br />If you are one of those hardcore believers that the plotline must follow the book then DO NOT WATCH this series, you will be severely disappointed.  However if you are looking to just be plain old entertained by an imaginative plotline then dive right in!<br /><br />This is not a series for those squeamish about blood, lust, drugs and things that go bump in the night, this series contains plenty of those things.  It also contains a great story about a girl who is viewed as simple showing those around her that she is actually strong and formidable.<br /><br />If you did enjoy this tv series I suggest reading the books.  They are ten times better and way more addicting than this tv series will ever be!<br /><br />~TigressSky~
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|tres hombres encapsulates the 10 - 15 years of pentatonic blues/garage rock/lsd laced musical exploration from the late 60's/early 70's into less than 40 crackling minutes. this recording is the pinnacle of the art movement and mind set defined by the 13th floor elevators, jimi hendrix, little walter horton, muddy waters, howlin' wolf, lightnin' hopkins, and of course the infinite number of acid cracked/backwoods beard strokers & homo sapiens soaking up this swamp mix around the world. listening today brings back the paradoxical appreciation of Molly's chalupas, cervezas, and 4 way hits to nirvana. i thought i'd breathed my last breath!    as Billy sez.... think about it
B0017HV05E|5.0|Amazing, powerful and very moving novel. It's comical yet educational, spiritual, and mind-challenging. It forces the reader to evaluate humanity and to question truth. The novel is a story, it's told in 2 perspectives, and without giving too much, Yann Martel lets the reader develop a conclusion after two same but different stories are told.     Love it
0385341008|5.0|I felt this was a very well-written, wonderful story, great characters, and lots of surprises.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|Serenity is ok for those who wanted more Firefly, but it really is one last hurrah.  The way the movie was written, there is almost no way they could bring back the show- which is probably a factor in why they didn't.  I introduced my wife to Firefly, and she loved it, but wouldn't talk to me for a couple hours after Serenity because now it will change how she remembers it- instead of everyone continuing to go off on missions, the absence of those characters drags you down a bit.      If they hadn't killed off a couple main characters, perhaps they could have relaunched the series once enough momentum had been gained... and delved into more back-story about the characters (including those killed) but, a few years on now, it's obvious that it isn't meant to be and Firefly will remain a cult-classic.  One of the best, and shortest lived series of all time, but without much possibility of ever being dusted off for continuation.  Disappointment at the death of those characters aside, it was a great movie, and even their deaths add a gritty \\"realism\\" where everyone is used to the episodic formula where everyone goes off on a perilous adventure and everyone (with the exception of the red-shirts) survives for a new adventure.  On dangerous missions, not everyone comes home alive (But Gorram it, why not?).  Firefly/Serenity, once you see it all, pulls you in and leaves you starved for more that will never come, but all in all, it's Shiny.
0385341008|5.0|What first drew me to the book was the story of the author and how the book came to be.  I'm sad there are to be no other books by her as I enjoyed this one very much, it's right up there with my all-time favorites - I did not want it to end. The book described a lovely slice of island life during and after the war. The characters are very vivid; I wanted to meet every one of them!
B000WS4QJG|5.0|All I can say is that Pop is now no more without the King.   Thank you Michael Jackson for upbringing a new era of music.  You will be missed by all
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|if you hate this film you ultimately hate life, people who find it boring just have short attention spans, not a single moment was it ever boring, its a sweet sentimental movie about father and son, you must be extremely cold hearted and stupid to find this movie boring and unmoving. Don't expect this to be a typical Tim Burton movie, its quite different and it just proves that he can break out of his neo-gothic style that he is famous for, I mean I love all his work, and its great to see him try new things.
1401307957|5.0|This book is sad, funny, makes you angry, upset, happy, everthing in it is definitely aimed straight to the heart! I enjoyed it. It's endearing and heartfelt. Makes you think about life being short and not so sweet sometimes. Thanks for making me count my blessings in this book.

B000OCXM68|5.0|Not much to say about Michael Buble except that he is a pleasure to listen too. Soft, great voice, cool and with a little more of ripening, succesor to Frankie. And a gresat band with him
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I was always more of a rock type when I was younger, but listened to some Motown.  Then there was the Thriller, the perfect blend of rock and pop.    And of course the song writing and musicianship was brilliant.  Michael was very smart in what he did during these times, and Eddie playing guitar was suprising and great.  He repeated this later on on Dangerous with Slash, another call which may have had some people sctratching their heads, but worked.    Later on many performers emulated what he had done, cross over performances with artist's (Walk This Way comes to mind) and his stage show and moves were blueprints for so many.    He truly was the King Of Pop.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|What I said for \\"Call me irresponsible\\" alo applies here plus, there is a great DVD with a show by Michael from LA. He is great and shuld have a brilliant future

1603090002|5.0|The intermediate outing of this series, \\"The Black Dossier\\", was a tat of disappointment after the first 2 volumes of \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\". It was good, but it was all over the map. This start of a new sequence lifts the series back to greatness of those two earlier volumes. Although the \\"Threepenny Opera\\" riffs throughout this tale may be a couple of decades early, they are very well played. They are definitely 20th Century. As much as Moore played with Martian mythology in Vol. 2, he now plays with German expressionism. I hope that future issues will explore the literature of the 20th Century with similar gusto. Personally I look forward to the 1930's Pulp Era of America if the creators wish to go that direction. I hope that there will be 10 Century issues - one for every decade. Words and images merge well to display all of the diverse characters at their best. Keep your eye out for further glimpses into this marvelous alternate literary universe. Highly Reccommended

0517123207|5.0|If you wear a Darwin t-shirt, or think about how things got to be how they are, this is a must read.  It is still a great read 150 years after it first came out.    I read this book several years ago because I heard so much about it.  I don't have a science background, but it struck home with me in a way that no other book has.  By just making the right observations, he unraveled what had been a mystery to that point in time.  The book methodically develops the theory, and uses observations to advance it along.      Ever since reading the book, I now see common things like our family cat, or other animals and plants in my yard, and know that they all have a story in how they got to be the way they are - and he came up with a way to explain that in rational terms.  The book explains much of this in a way I can (mostly) understand.     The book does have flaws that other reviewers note - so it is not perfect.  As I understand he was wrong on some things.  I am not smart enough to know what those defects are.  I do know it will continue to be controversial for those who don't accept the science.  But here is the thing, long after humans are gone from this earth, the religous beliefs and ignorance will be irrelevent.  But the basic forces of nature will continue to shape the living things of this planet, pretty much along the lines described in the book.      Amazing.
0553573411|5.0|Fitz is in a weakened condition after someone made an attempt to kill him and now he must make choose between going back to Buckkeep to live under the same roof as the man who wants him dead or striking out on his own and abandoning the oath he made to his king.  When duty prevails, arguably over good sense, Fitz makes the treacherous journey home.  Rest was in short supply then as he needed to be ready for any possible danger that may befall him back in the castle while he grew into a man and more of a weapon for his king.      Royal Assassin is book 2 of Robin Hobb's The Farseer trilogy.  What was maybe only hinted to be a complex story in the first book blossomed in the second.  The first book only scratches the surface.  The second book plunges readers into the story head first.  Fitz continues his training to kill from the shadows as a secret assassin for the king, he learns to fight in hand-to-hand combat when Prince Verity sees what he can do on the battlefield, he sails with his people to confront the Red Ship Raiders learning to row a ship and fight on board, he receives permission to court a young woman, he makes new friends, and he maybe loses another.  Love, hate, betrayal, loyalty, pain.      This book was wonderfully written and had elements of every genre I can name.  The characters' emotions ran wild across the pages and I was the string wrapped around the author's finger, unable to put the book down until I knew what happened next.  Can you recall the book that cemented the fact that you would read every book that Robin Hobb wrote?  I can - Royal Assassin.
0452295548|3.0|My Stroke of Insight is a very interesting and informative book.  The information on symptons and signs of a stroke, along with how to care for a stroke patient from the victims prospective is invaluable.  I was most interested in the things the author was aware of during her healing process, and her inner cognitive awareness was amazing. The technical information in chapters 2 and 3 were a little trying at times but is a necessary in the education of the reader.  Overall this book is a good read.
1600243916|4.0|Gladwell does a great job of \\"looking beneath the surface\\" to find the real reason that certain things happen.  That statement is too general but in a nutshell, Outliers is worth a read if you want to open up your point of view and ability to look at the world around you through a new perspective.  Most of the stories / examples are very entertaining.
031606792X|4.0|This is the most unique book of the series. I felt like there were really two stories told in the book: the conclusion of the long narrative we saw in the first three and the beginning of another.  But still a great way to end a book. I won't give away the plot.  You start the book wondering will Team Jacob ever get his chance.  Will Bella ever become a \\"cold one?\\"  You get all your questions answered and more in this, the longest of the books.
1596680296|5.0|I actually made a wearable sock using this book.  I started knitting just two months ago and realized I wasn't interested in making sweaters or afghans.  I thought, \\"SOME DAY I'll learn to knit socks\\".  Well, after finding that none of the classes at the local yarn shop suited my schedule, I picked up Ann's book from the library and just took the plunge and cast on.  And now I have a sock!  It's not perfect or anything, but I got through the entire thing using this book -- all the others went back to the library almost untouched.  I'm buying this one because, as others have said, it has adjustments based on yarn weight and stitches per inch.  I really like the way she took it section by section and made it seem easy.  And it really WAS easy the way she explained it.  Now I'm ready to knit some patterned socks, but this book will be the one I go back to when I'm stuck.....and when someone else says, 'can you show me how to do knit socks?'  :o))  ENJOY!!
B0028SVXR6|4.0|When i heard the new album was going to be a mellow I was excited.  Lets face it, a college student in their mid 20s can't be a \\"headbanger\\" forever having followed Omar and Cedric from ATDI.  It was cute in highschool, but much like their progressive style, i've progressed to a less loud and in-your-face style of music.      This album will not dissapoint the people looking forward to a new Mars Volta sound.  The tempo of Octahedron is mellow, trippy, peaceful and heartfelt.  To me the most enjoyable aspect of the album was Cedric.  When I first listened to Bedlem, I was taken back by how little expression their was in his voice.  He sounded like he had lost vocal range from his Deloused and Frances days, only to attempt to cover it up with a naselly yelling voice as heard in the first two tracks of Bedlem.  Octahedron THANKFULLY showed me that he is still completely capeable of singing like he once did.  Please see the track \\"With Twilight As My Guide\\" for further proof.    I only have one dissapointment in the new CD.  The repuation their live shows have will suffer greatly from this new album.  I saw TMV live in January of 2008 on the Bedlem club tour.  This was my first time witnessing what would be the most amazing live performances ever.  The energy and antics of the group is still unmatched by any other live performance.  The tracks on Octahedron just won't carry the same ammount of performing excitement we're used to.      All in all I give it a 4/5 for what I expected, but I give the TMV 5/5 for staying true to their progressive nature.

It seems as if this was a sign that the \\"Unpluged\\" event was Kurt's way of attending his own wake alive. If you buy the DVD you will see what I meen. This DVD has the full cut of the \\"unpluged\\" event with over 20 min that was not shown on MTV. If you are a true Nirvana fan you don't want to miss this chance to see Kurt's 'permeated funeral concert' on this amazing DVD, not only to see a moment of Nirvana history, but to get a front row seat to his funeral / wake!

Cassandra Clare penned an enthralling safari & her Mortal Instruments series exhibits<br />Clare is one exceptionally talented scribe.<br /><br />Clare's rendering of Clary as an unparalleled, three-dimensional, empowering heroine is simply a breath of fresh air (am I the only one who thinks Clary Fray is an uber chic rear kickin' fantasy version of Cassandra Clare).<br /><br />City of Bones is plush in ambiance.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|My family was addicted to the Sookie Stackhouse series and when the True Blood series arrived, we just love it.  It came quickly and was in great shape.  The whole family sits down together to watch and we get a kick out of seeing the book characters do their thing.
1400063736|5.0|This is hands down one of the best books I have ever read.   It is in some ways more than just \\"a book\\": there are many books I really liked, books that made me hold my breath and kept me up all night reading, books that live with you even when you're not reading them, but rarely have I had in my hands a book that made me cry, laugh, smile and think, that was so engaging it's hard to put down until you're done reading it, and even after you're done. And I can't quite remember any other book I found myself talking out loud to.  I'm not quite sure what particular nerves it struck, but yes, it is that good!  It's amazing how all the different characters' voices are so real, so spot on, as you read them. There are ten stories, ten characters, whose lives cross paths in minor or major ways, on the backdrop of Philippe Petit's walk between the twin towers, and that moment of beauty becomes the 11th story. I would not have been surprised to find out they were real stories, and had been written by 11 different writers, so accurate each story's narrating voice is. And each of the stories is so beautiful, so compelling, so full, and they all are woven into one another, creating a unity, a line of beauty that carries everything throughout the book.  That is, at the end, what I cherish the most about this novel: the sense that beauty, like tragedy, is inexplicable, doesn't need a reason, you can't really do anything about it. But it's there. There is beauty...

B000000WA4|5.0|Although most Smashing Pumpkins fans think that \\"Siamese Dream\\" is the pinnacle of their work, their third album truly shot the Smashing Pumpkins over the top.<br /><br />The double CD \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" is an amazingly innovative album showing off the angst and emotion of Generation X.<br /><br />It deceptively begins with a soft piano piece named after the album name. Then, with the beautiful blur of an orchestra and loud guitars, Smashing Pumpkins blast off with the beautiful single \\"Tonight, Tonight.\\" Corgan is a fleeting inspiration for teenagers when he sings \\"Believe, believe in me, believe/that life can change, that you're not stuck in vain.\\"<br /><br />It's true that the lyrical angst reaches a lame duck Bukowski level with excessively loud songs such as \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings.\\" Still, there's something undeniably edgy when Corgan yells in a whine, \\"Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage/Then someone will say what is lost can never be saved.\\" And the intensely loud growl of the guitars is extremely exciting.<br /><br />By the time the album reaches the song \\"F*** You (an ode to no one),\\" Corgan is going bonkers with the wail of his electric guitar. The album includes other more bizarre experiments in sound, such as the half-electronic, half-shoegazer-style-guitar song \\"Love,\\" the angelic harp song \\"Cupid De Locke,\\" long serene opening of \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\\" and the infamous psychedelic acoustic song \\"Thirty-Three.\\" It's a ethereal double-cd of sonic magnificence, to say the least.<br /><br />But it's incredibly catchy. \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" literally can suck anyone in with its beautiful acoustics in some songs and frighteningly loud guitars in others. Of course, I almost forgot to mention the infamously cool acoustic song \\"1979,\\" in which Corgan reflects on old memories before singing that \\"we don't know/just where our bones will rest/to dust I guess/forgotten and absorbed into the earth below.\\"<br /><br />As unusual as the album gets with weird dulcimer sounds in \\"We Only Come Out At Night,\\" it is one of the most eclectic albums of the 90s, with more spunk than even Pearl Jam would show off in \\"Vitalogy.\\" Anyone looking for a grunge album drenched in the acoustic of gorgeous fantasy world of Lewis Carroll will definitely love \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\"ts with weird dulcimer sounds in \\"We Only Come Out At Night,\\" it is one of the most eclectic albums of the 90s, with more spunk than even Pearl Jam would show off in \\"Vitalogy.\\" Anyone looking for a grunge album drenched in the acoustic of gorgeous fantasy world of Lewis Carroll will definitely love \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\"
B00065F86U|4.0|I was surprised when I received my Nikon MB-D10 that it didn't come with a chamber cover when used with the EN-EL4/EN-EL4a battery, since I have never run into any one who has the MB-D10 who wasn't using one of those battery packs (versus the AA battery tray that comes with it).      Aside from that bit of dissatisfaction, the BL-3 bettery chamber cover is a set-it-and-forget-it accessory.  It works just as you'd expect and I'd be surprised if you give it a second thought.  Both the EN-EL4/EN-EL4a battery snaps solidly into the chamber cover and with a quarter turn of the gate is securely connected to the MB-D10 grip.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I was on myspace talking to my friend.  All of a sudden, I got a message from her saying that she was sad for what happened to Michael Jackson.  I didn't know what was going on, so I turned on the tv.  It was about a quarter after three and they said that Michael Jackson was dead.  I was shocked.  I woke up my mom, and even though she was half asleep, she woke up in full after I told her the bad news.  The first thing she wanted to do was turn on the tv.  Later that day she cried for him.  MJ was the best pop star ever.  RIP
0780622650|4.0|If you go into this movie expecting sublime plots or whatever, then you're doomed to dissapointment, if you go in, just expecting a fun movie, then it can be a lot of fun. It is in no way, other than a few homages, tied to the original TV series, so don't go expecting it to be a continuation. It's not. It's a stand-alone story, and, as such, stands alone. It's typical summer scifi action movie fare, and for the day, the CGI was really good. Now it's dated, and suffers in comparison, but CGI always does that. Overall, a fun movie.  Interestingly enough, this version had a lot about french subtitles and features, so I am guessing this is the french export version, no problems, just thought I would put that out there.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|My four children, now all in their 30's, came of age with this album. This version is a great reissue of the original. Michael Jackson defined popular music for my kids' generation, as Elvis did for mine and Sinatra did for my parents.<br /><br />Where MJ transcended them is as a composer, dancer, and all-around entertainer. Elvis shook his hips; MJ danced and evoked the wondering praise of Fred Astaire. Sinatra used the technology of his time, recording, movies, the microphone to transmit his art. MJ re-created the technology with a completely new approach to videos and stage pyrotechnics that now define modern song and dance, concerts and showmanship.<br /><br />Thriller was his apogee. The tiniest handful of gifted performers attained anything approaching his genius, his talent, his out and out supremacy as an entertainer.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|This has to be one of the most pleasing, thought provoking and beautifully made science fiction films of the decade. The movie is briliantly acted out, well crafted and will leave the viewer affected by its charm and dignity.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is not a workout for sissys! You will really need to go hard for this one and will get results. I'm exhausted when the 20 min are over, and covered with sweat, but my arms look great and I really like working out more than one muscle group at a time. The rest of me will most likely need more than 30 days, though...
0525478183|4.0|I found this to be an entertaining read.   I think a little bit of Margo (a main character) can be found in anyone. Everyone has the need to find themselves.   This is a quest for a seach for herself, although it seems as though people are searching for her.  Although an entertaining read, this book is actually quite deep.   I found myself wanting them to find her, and I don't think that was the point. A bit of mystery, a bit of soul searching, a bit of action, all wound up in one. I don't want to be a spoiler, so I won't go into the storyline too much. But, overall, a great book to read over the weekend to take your mind away.
B000002C4J|3.0|This vendor is excellent.  I received the CD earlier than planned and in perfect condition.  The CD itself is a separate matter.  I've got nothing against Celine Dion's music.  It's just not my cup of pee.  I purchased this CD for a relative.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This film has it all!  The cast is phenomenal, the plot is killer and the action is out of control!  Batman Begins was a great start in revamping the series, and The Dark Knight just took it to a whole new level.  Some sequels are extremely weak compared to their predecessors, but not so with this one.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Off the Wall has nothing but excellent music by the King of Pop, Michael Jackson. I am absolutely shocked and saddened to hear of his death earlier today. I want to write this review to remember him and honor him properly as one of the best entertainers we ever had; and I hope he rests in peace. The quality of the sound on this CD is excellent and I like that artwork, too.<br /><br />There's so much good music here; there's not a single dud in the bunch. \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" has a great beat and Michael handles this extremely well; his voice is in excellent form and the percussion really enhances the arrangement, too. Great! \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\" makes a powerful beginning number for this album. \\"Rock with You\\" is catchy and great; this is classic pop that will always sound good--Michael delivers this flawlessly like the pro he always was! He sings with a great deal of passion in his voice and I'm very impressed.<br /><br />The album then takes a turn for the faster and somewhat more energetic \\"Working Day and Night.\\" \\"Working Day and Night\\" has some pretty awesome musical effects and Michael sings this as effortlessly as if it were mere breathing. Of course, we know it really wasn't all that easy--Michael's talent always carried him through. \\"Off the Wall,\\" the title track, is absolutely mesmerizing; I loved this song from the very first time I ever heard it and I always enjoy listening to this! \\"Off the Wall\\" is first-rate music and a prime example of Michael's very fine artistry.<br /><br />If you like your pop music somewhat softer, no problem--listen for \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"She's Out of My Life;\\" these two numbers have a softer flavor even when the lyrics aren't all that happy. \\"She's Out of My Life\\" works well and it's a major highlight of this album, too. \\"I Can't Help It\\" gets the royal treatment from Michael Jackson who delivers this faultlessly; Michael never lets go of a single superfluous note and that's grand.<br /><br />\\"It's the Falling in Love\\" is truly special. \\"Burn This Disco Out\\" is another excellent song; it sticks in your head long after you hear it for the first time--this music is all THAT good. In addition, it's very interesting to hear Michael's original demo recording of \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough.\\" We get the original demo recording of \\"Working Day and Night;\\" and the album ends well with an interview featuring Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton.<br /><br />This edition of this CD comes with a special booklet; and I assure you that the restoration of the main tracks is magnificent.<br /><br />Michael Jackson died today; but of course he lives on through his music. I'll need time to truly comprehend our loss; it's tough to take and very shocking.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|A few episodes shorter than other seasons due to the writer's strike but action packed and full of twists. The writers are brilliant and as usual, deliver some of the best mind blowing episodes ever. Each and every episode is a thrill ride. This season does not disappoint.    Every actor/actress gives an outstanding performance, including the new characters from the freighter.     The commentaries are fantastic, showing how much goes into making each show. The bloopers and deleted scenes are always fun.    Definitely worth the money and a must have season.
1439102813|5.0|Still Alice is an absolutely incredible book. I was hesitant, at first, to read the book, as I thought it would be horrifyingly depressing, but I was very wrong in that assumption and am so glad that I read it.  The author does an amazing job of showing the reader what it is like to be a person suffering from Alzheimer's, thus turning a read that could have been simply depressing into an interesting and educational journey. I absolutely loved this book.
0060794410|5.0|I was referred to this book by a friend and now I am thanking him. With each chapter I found myself reflecting on my own companies and seeing how I can tranform the company from Good to Great. Since finishing the book (on cd) I find myself everyday thinking about aspects of the knowledge I learned. In a couple weeks I will listen again. I enjoyed the cd read by the author as I found Jim Collins an easy listen. I will be ordering other Collins books soon.
B000002B7U|3.0|Despite some great singing and masterful guitar work, this album is no doubt Ozzy's lamest studio album in his 40 year career.  For Ozzy, the songs are just way below the standard he set for himself on his previous and following releases. Possibly due to the reported friction between Ozzy and Jake E. Lee going on at the time. This CD is really just for Ozzy die-hards only.
B00005QGAT|5.0|I use to listen to this album every night to go to sleep & I listen to Thriller upon waking. From age 12-14 that was my ritual:) We will miss you Michael. There was no one like you & there never will be.

006112429X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read all year & may be in my top 20 of all time. This is a dense, meaty read full of complex ideas & painful moments leavened by its utter believability & unexpected touches of wry wit & sardonic humor.<br /><br />Eva, the mother of a school shooter, is writing to her ex-husband about their son. It is apparent from the very beginning of the letters that something was wrong with Kevin, although his father refused to see it. Ms. Shriver dares to write about all the ways that pregnancy is deprivation & physical misery. She explores the equally taboo notion that bearing a child doesn't mean you automatically love said child & the fact that some children are born with various parts of themselves broken.<br /><br />The relationships & people in this book are believable. The pace is inexorable & grinds the reader into pulp along with the characters. It's form absolutely fits its function & where it could easily have been clunky is instead engrossing & fluid. It is powerful, beautifully written, & utterly intelligent. This is an absolute must-read.
159562015X|5.0|Had to buy the book to take the online test. After that all the information online was also in the book. I wish they had a way just to buy the test online. I guess I could look up other strengths but why. haha. They also elude to having other minor strengths besides your top 5 but no way to find that out. It is nice knowing why I react to certain things the way I do. If you searching for self realization this is one step on the journey.
0143034901|5.0|One of the best five books I've ever read in my 62 years, even surpassing \\"The English Patient\\" as my favorite novel.  It's descriptive prose and unraveling of a mystery reminds me of the \\"Patient\\" style, almost poetic.  But \\"The Shadow...\\" moves quicker through the labrynthian story that connects so many lives, and the author takes care to occasionally help you remember some of the important threads.  I am excited about the info that Zalon will write other books that somehow links them all together.

B000WS4QJG|2.0|Like millions of teenage white kids in 1983, I picked up this cassette (you young'ns may not be too familiar with that word) on the strength of a hat trick of powerful singles - \\"The Girl Is Mine\\" (a happy/sunny infectious pseudo-ballad duet w/ Paul McCartney), \\"Billie Jean\\" (it wasn't quite disco, wasn't quite funk, wasn't quite new wave, wasn't quite R&B, but somehow managed to be all those things, and you COULDN'T GET IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD), and \\"Beat It\\" (along with \\"Billie Jean\\", arguably one of the ten best singles of the 1980's, and still the closest thing to metal Michael's ever done).  I expected the remainder of it to equally blow me away, but I was sorely disappointed in that regard.  \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\"?  Sounds like a slightly more grown-up version of the playground chant, \\"na-na-na-na-boo-boo, you can't catch me\\".  \\"Human Nature\\"?  Pure adult contemporary schmaltz.  \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\"?  Me neither.  The only other track on the album that I thought rose to the heights of those first three singles was the title track, and with each single that was pumped out from this album, I kept wondering, \\"Why the heck don't they release `Thriller'?\\"  They finally did in December of '83, a year after the album came out, accompanied by what is still considered by many to be the greatest rock video ever made.  I felt vindicated when the song managed to crack the Top Five, despite being on an album that was now practically issued with new babies along with their birth certerficates and social security numbers the moment they exited the womb.  But four great songs does not make a great album, and the remaining tunes - eh, I could just do without them.  In fact, the only other tune on it I really liked was one of the two tunes that WASN'T released as a single - the generic but pleasantly swinging \\"Baby Be Mine\\".
1401307450|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, but I'm familiar with some of their more popular songs. I picked up this book mainly because one of my friends was reading it and I scanned the first couple of pages and thought it sounded interesting.<br /><br />I was engrossed throughout the entire book. Kiedis has certainly led an interesting life and my interest was peaked throughout. I enjoyed the writing style and the structure.<br /><br />Thumbs up from me.

1592402690|5.0|I'm not much of a Beatles fan, but I could not put this book down. It's a fascinating look not only at the Beatles but at the creative process at work, and the inner dynamics of a band on it's rise to the top. Along the way you get an insider's view of the creative decisions that lead to the songs and sounds we know so well. For anyone into recording, this book will inspire you to try something new and experiment more. Great book and a great read.
B000JQTWPO|5.0|I have become a recent convert to Victorian literature.  Educated as an electrical engineer, I did not appreciate literature until I reached my 70's.  This book is to the modern detective novel as Maxwell's equations are to the wireless engineer of today.  All the modern detective novels follow the basics exhibited in Moonstone, but usually fall far short because they leave out one or more of the \\"equations\\".  A thoroughly gripping and inventive novel by a master.
1401359418|1.0|Touted as a book of \\"scientific research\\" (ha-ha) this appalling book contains not one new idea. It's the same old buncombe that if you think positive, your luck will improve and success (including winning the lottery) and romance will come your way.<br /><br />This idea has been around among caucasians with a certain genetic defect for many years. Voltaire wrote a short novel, [[ASIN:1416500308 Candide]], subtitled \\"Optimism,\\" about it.<br /><br />Over a hundred years ago, French drugstore owner and self-proclaimed psychologist &Eacute;mile Cou&eacute; made a fortune with his program of self improvement based on optimistic autosuggestion. Since the mind is all powerful (this was something like Christian Science without the God business), we can effect genuine change in our lives by simply repeating \\"Day-by-day, in every way, I'm getting better and better.\\"<br /><br />Not specifically remembered by many today, Cou&eacute;'s philosophy had a lasting influence on Western culture, as exemplified by the 1959 movie \\"North By Northwest\\" in which Cary Grant's character says to his secretary \\"Take a note: 'Think thin!'.\\" In the 1980s, the late Norman Cousins claimed to have cured himself of a fatal disease by watching old slapstick movies (and also the massive doses of vitamin C that were then in vogue).<br /><br />This book also espouses the notion, common among the feeble minded, that if you get run over by a street car and survive, that's an example of good luck. How can this be? Simple! It couldda been worse! You couldda been killed!  I tend to hastily excuse myself from the company of those with such an attitude. If they're driving I'll leap out at the first stop light.<br /><br />In addition to this delirious optimism, Professor Wiseman presents a few of those old optical illusions that have fascinated children for generations.  (What? Both circles are the same size? But the one looks bigger! Amazing!)<br /><br />If you are inspired by reading such nonsense, I have an even better method of self improvement that is certain to improve your life. Keep repeating this mantra over and over.

B000WS4QJG|5.0|\\"Thriller\\" is an essential purchase and an undeniably great album full of infectious hooks, deep grooves and a glossy hi-tech sheen that has emerged unscathed from the 1980's into the 21st century (and perhaps beyond). Neither time nor the veil of nostalgia have blunted its impact -- an all-time bestseller, to be sure -- as a crucial flashpoint from which a decade was defined (along with U2's \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" Madonna's first two albums, Prince's \\"Purple Rain\\" LP and David Bowie's \\"Let's Dance\\" album).<br /><br />Putting aside the hype, the tie-in merchandise and all that came afterward for the artist (both personally and professionally), Michael Jackson rolled through the 1980's as a veritable juggernaut of talent. How many Gen. X'ers wore out their footwear trying to imitate his trademark Moonwalk? I'm fairly certain I wasn't the only one.<br /><br />Have a listen to the song samples included here by Amazon. That bass line in \\"Billie Jean?\\" Delicious! How about that five-note synth loop and Vincent Price's rap in \\"Thriller\\" itself? Admit it: you love it, I love it (and so does your Grandma)! The first cut, \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" flirts with African chants and polyrhythms, earlier used to such great effect by Talking Heads and presages the coming popularity of World Music (and Paul Simon's 1986 \\"Graceland\\" LP). To these ears, \\"Baby Be Mine\\" sounds best, coming across as an understated, sparkling, danceable standout with a funky virtuoso synth hook and soulful vocal found nowhere else on the record (\\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"P.Y.T.\\" approach it, though).<br /><br />\\"Beat It\\" simply rocks!<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B000WS4QJG Michael Jackson 25th Anniversary of Thriller]] contains all the videos (how scary was the \\"Thriller\\" short film back in the day?) and a delightful Motown TV performance that showcases everything that made Michael Jackson the King of Pop. \\"Nobody moves like Michael Jackson,\\" said one fan when interviewed back in the '80s. Indeed! The extra tracks are just superfluous honey on an already sweet treat.<br /><br />Being too young to appreciate \\"Off the Wall\\" when it came out (an interesting Disco record but nothing more) and too old by the time \\"Bad\\" came 'round (not nearly as funky; too poppy), this always felt like \\"my\\" Michael Jackson album. It seems several million others feel the same way.<br /><br />According to the liner notes, Michael Jackson was justly proud of \\"Thriller\\" as both a landmark personal achievement and a historical one. Pick this one up -- it's a classic!e just superfluous honey on an already sweet treat.<br /><br />Being too young to appreciate \\"Off the Wall\\" when it came out (an interesting Disco record but nothing more) and too old by the time \\"Bad\\" came 'round (not nearly as funky; too poppy), this always felt like \\"my\\" Michael Jackson album.

B000002KB8|5.0|This and the first zeppelin album is where it all started,every hard rock band since has followed these 2 blueprints.The most influential metal album of all time. The debut of the founding fathers. Sabbath were initially inspired by The Beatles to make music but this album began with a simple idea after Iommi came out the cinema. His idea was if people would pay too see a horror movie maybe they would pay to listen to a horror album. He was right and Metal was born..............

B000002GJH|5.0|In the ashes of MOTHER LOVE BONE(seatle's best band)., this cd was recorded as a tribute to ANDREW WOOD.get this and also get MOTHER LOVE BONE.This album came about as a result of the death of Mother Love Bone lead singer, Andrew Wood. He shared a house with Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell and this album is basically his tribute to Andrew. The first two songs that he wrote following Andrew's death were the albums opening tracks, \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" and \\"Reach Down\\". \\"Say Hello..\\" in particular is just beautiful - a sincerely and emotionally written song that is amazingly powerful in it's content and general feel.  Later songs were written when Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, Eddie Vedder and Mike McCready, who all went on the form Pearl Jam, were drafted in. Tracks such as Hunger Strike, Call Me A Dog and Four Walled World again strike an emotional chord, whilst songs like Reach Down and Pushin' Forward Back provide the rock. This is an excellently crafted, powerful album, which was a perfectly fitting tribute to a man who should have become a rock legend. If you love Pearl Jam, Soundgarden or Mother Love Bone you will find this album a very welcome addition to your collection

0765350386|5.0|Good story idea. Lots of new, original ideas. Characters are not well developed, and the dialogue seemed unusual for a fantasy book. Sort of modern, trendy ways of speaking to each other. Powerful storytelling, though. He seems to be growing into this gig. Reading the second book now, and will read the third. A fantasy series that ends, what a concept. Hopefully his art will be more fully developed by the time the 12th book of The Wheel of Time is out. I think it's written. Jordan's wife picked Sanderson to finish it.<br /><br />\\"The Name Of The Wind\\" by Patrick Rothfuss is a vastly superior book, and I recommend it to all. It is THE great new fantasy book. But this book gets 5 stars also because although it has some minor things that stood out as I read it, the fact is it's a great read, an exciting page-turner, and promises more. No way it can be downgraded.
B000001ESP|5.0|The best of the rush releases by far,even people that are not rush fans know Tom Sawyer.In 1981 Rush recorded Moving Pictures which has to be one of the best in there catalogue. Contains one of there most popular songs 'Tom Sawyer' . 'Red Barchetta being my favorite on the album. YYZ is also a class instrumental despite that i do prefer the live version where Neil Peart has a drum solo which lasts for over three minutes.
B00005K9LK|5.0|By far and away PRIEST'S best album.you got another thing comin' might be the hit,but it is also the slackest song on this album.One of the defining albums of the glory years of 80s heavy metal. capturing a band at the height of their powers and featuring the track which brought them stardom in America \\"you've got another thing coming\\". From the opening track the Hellion, through \\"Riding on the Wind\\" Bloodstone\\" and more mellower songs like \\"Chains\\" and \\"Fever\\" the band never sounded so good. With an album as consistent yet varied as this, its just about the best they've ever done that is how good it is.
0823023494|5.0|For the record, I am not a professional animator/producer by any means, strictly a hobbyist (granted, an increasingly active hobbyist, but a hobbyist none-the-less), so take my review for what it is - the perspective of somebody with no formal character design or animation training. Basically, the concepts in this book were completely new to me.    This book was referenced in an Animation writing book I was reading. I checked it out of my local library and within a few days I knew I was going to need to purchase a copy of my own.    I know each person learns differently but I prefer books that presents and steps through new material, prompts exercises for the learner to complete, then reviews the salient points of the material just presented. This book does exactly that.    The material, too, is valuable. The author walks the reader through the thought processes of how to frame the viewer's perception of the character being designed i.e., when to use characters whose basic shapes are square and what kind of characters should be constructed from more oval-shaped foundations.    There are also interviews with industry professionals (who are also completing the exercises in the book). Some are insightful, some are entertaining, but the real value is the actual material in this book.    I find myself referring to the book whenever I start a new project. If nothing else, it reinforces the principles of character design and (hopefully) makes my work better each time.
B000002GK1|5.0|While SUPERUNKNOWN probably sold more and is a great cd, this is SOUNDGARDEN at their best and heaviest.It opens with the frenetic Rusty Cage and continues with such classics as Outshined and the manic Jesus Christ Pose.

B00275EGTC|4.0|\\"Moon\\" is kind of like \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" but with a 2009 feel.  Gerty (voiced somnolently by Kevin Spacey) is the updated HAL, and Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell) is the isolated, desperate human astronaut. Except \\"Moon\\" really isn't just a Kubrick retread; it only seems that way at first.  This movie gets to the core of what it means to be human.<br /><br />Duncan Jones' directorial debut has that cold, lonely feel typical of many movies involving space exploration.  There are some long--some would say tedious--shots of Sam's rover crossing the lunar surface, in search of a communication tower that needs repair; but of course, this is really about much more than just mechanical failure.  It's about how much humans need each other.  There are other scenes which pursue the same themes, but I won't go into great detail about them.  One involves a trek across the dusty terrain we know well, only to stumble upon the massive blue and green image of the earth.  Such a simple shot, obvious on paper yet surprisingly emotional in the movie theater, conveys more yearning and desire than the climax of any date movie you'll see this year.<br /><br />The haunting musical score is excellent as well.  Suffice it to say that if you've read my review this far and are still interested, you should just see the movie already.
B000001DWG|5.0|This is BONE cd to get. it contains everything recorded by the young band before ANDREW WOOD'S untimely death.groove seatle rock.The sound is reminiscent of early Pearl Jam, mainly due to the inclusion of Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament in the line up, but with a beautifully haunting edge on tracks like Chloe/Crown of Thorns and Gentle Groove, which would probably have to go down as my favourite song of all time. The harder rock of This Is Shangri-La and Mr Danny Boy is just superb, as is every other track on this amazing album.
0634022296|5.0|This was a gift for a musician friend lead singer who loved it! She plays the guitar and has another piano/keyboard musician performing with her.

B00003IQQA|5.0|this is one of the bands that you're not supposed to admit to liking. but with 30 million sold there must be a lot of closet fans. this is by far the best of the CREED catalogue.if you only know them just by their singles you should at least listen listen to the ones you didn't hear on the radio.
0810993139|4.0|Jeff Kinney, Diary of a Wimpy Kid (Abrams, 2007)<br /><br />The Diary of a Wimpy Kid books have become the biggest teen-lit sensation since Harry Potter, so I figured I needed to see what all the fuss was about and give them a try. I was quite pleasantly surprised, though the book is based on a webcomic and sometimes feels like it.<br /><br />Greg Heffley is the wimpy kid of the title, and is also (not surprisingly) the narrator of this \\"novel in comics\\". He and his best friend Rowley are school outcasts. We go through Greg and Rowley's seventh grade year, seeing things through Greg's jaundiced eyes as he tries to climb the social ladder while not turning into a complete idiot.<br /><br />Lots of other reviews have talked about how authentic Greg's voice is, and that's a strong part of what makes this so much fun, but no one zeroes in on Greg's finely-honed sense of self-deception. What makes him amusing is his sense of humor, but what makes hi compelling is the ways in which he lies to himself in order to justify some of his decisions when everyone around him can see his real motivation. That's the sort of little quirk that turns an average book into a good one. Quite enjoyable, and I'm really looking forward to the next two. *** ½
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Will you enrich your literary treasury with this book? Absolutely not.<br />Will you remember half of the content after reading this book? probably not.<br />Will you have one hell of a good time reading this book, yes, yes yes..<br /><br />This book is simply fun to read, a true page turner. It is exciting, and so intelligently written that you'd one give lend it to a friend of your after reading it, then you won't remember who it was. I honestly suggest this book to anyone who wants to relax and have good time on the beach, or on a long flight. Some books are just for fun, and Brooks perfectly reaches his goal for writing this book; Make folks have fun.
B001O6W9QC|3.0|I did not think I would be surprised by the twists.  I was thankful for these as they covered up my disappointments in where the script really dragged on painfully slow.  It was good enough to make me laugh, and say more then once, \\"No way! They did not just do that!\\"
B001PPGAIA|4.0|This movie got very diverse reviews, I'm one that really liked it. I felt most of the problems with it were due to the editing and not the actors. Should have been more tightly edited and that would have made the story flow better. Luhrmann set out to film an epic of Australia, but fails in that he covers too much. There were several themes to the movie and following one or two of them would have tightened the movie and made it more watchable.<br />Kidman and Jackman have chemistry and both of them shine in their roles. I loved their love story. I felt there was a lot of unfair criticism about Kidman's \\"stilted\\" acting. She was acting the part of a repressed English woman and as the movie went on Lady Sarah loosened up. She was fabulous. Jackman was fabulous as the drover.<br />If you go into the movie understanding that this movie is too long due to the director's ambitious vision and focus on Jackman/Kidman's relationship, it will be much more enjoyable.

B000ZN802W|5.0|When Chris McCandless (Emile Hirsch) graduated from college, he had one goal in life - to finally break away from his unhappy family and the constraints of society in general and live off the land in Alaska.  The  film flashes back and forth between Chris' adventure in Alaska and the months leading up to it, focusing on the people who befriended him, including an aging hippie couple and a lonely, old man (well-played by the venerable Hal Holbrook).<br /><br />Based on a true story and narrated with many of Chris' journal entries, the film is an emotional roller coaster; I was torn between admiring his youthful idealism and courage and hating him for the pain he inflicted on his family.  The movie feels much like a documentary as it follows Chris hitchhiking and working his way across the country and then surviving, at first quite well, in Alaska.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch is well-cast as Chris and makes you care about him right from the start.  He did all of his demanding stunts himself and even lost 40 pounds to play the ailing Chris.  It is a very touching story.  Surrounded by the splendor of the wilderness but ultimately alone, Chris finally understood that happiness is only real when it is shared.  Highly recommended.

B00005QGAT|5.0|I rank \\"Off the Wall\\" album along with Stevie Wonder's \\"Song's in the Key of Life\\" as the best records of all time.  Upon hearing about Michaels death, I ordered it a fresh copy along with \\"Bad\\" and \\"Thiller\\" (I'm glad I did as it appears to be on backorder.) I've been looking at and listening to memorials of Michael since he died and I can't get enough. There are many who may not understand why so much press and so much interest... He affected so many peoples lifes.  I'm in my early 40's so his music was such a major part of my childhood up into adulthood. I remember watching Motown 25 when I was in High School with my girlfriends on the small TV in my kitchen.  When Michael performed, we were mezorized...especially when he did the Moonwalk. It was all anyone talked about at school the next day. I woke up this morning hoping his death was just a horrible dream...  It wasn't.  His music will live on forever.  RIP Michael.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Thriller is undoubtedly the best pop record ever made.   I don't know a single person that doesn't like at least one track from it.     My mom bought it on cassette as a teen, and used to play it for me when I was little. We eventually had to throw the tape away, because it became so warn that the sound was warped - but even so, it never got old.     'Billie Jean' is especially one of those tracks that you don't ever get sick of. It's catchy, dance worthy, and yet at the same time, has an odd - almost eerie tone, giving it such a great atmosphere.     Everyone keeps saying there will never be another Michael Jackson,  and they're right - he was truly the King of Pop - and will never be forgotten.      RIP Michael, we love you.
0920236162|5.0|I was first exposed to this book in my Elementary Teaching Language Arts Class.  We used it as a Reader's Theatre piece.  I love that this book is a definite reversal of strong characters.  The princess emerges as the strong heroine that is true to herself.  I think it is inspirational for all the \\"real\\" princesses out there.  I would love to see more books in this category that show strong women for girls.  I also would love to see more books for boys in the young adult category that can interests boys in reading!  It is refreshing to see these trends beginning to emerge!

0061854549|5.0|I have been thinking about economics seriously for nearly 30 years. Classical economics is built to no small degree on the notion that people will generally act in their own best self interest, after rationally and intelligently examining their options. This fit my world view fine in my first career as an engineer (BS and MS in Electrical Engineering).     From my 2nd Career as a Business Development person (MBA), I began to have to deal with people's tendency to not entirely think things through.     Here in this book, we have a professor who runs socioeconomic tests on his MBA students. These students are smart enough, worldly enough, experienced enough, and educated enough to approximate the standard economic assumptions and produce reasonably rational behavior.     Guess what. Even among broad experiments conducted on multiple MBA classes over time, one can predictably pre-bias the outcome of a particular run of a socioeconomic experiment by what seeds you plant in the class members' minds before the experiment. For example, in one experiment in estimating prices, the author requires his students to write the last two digits of their social security numbers on the top of the paper. Simply the act of writing a high number (e.g., 88) versus a low number (e.g., 08) produced statistically significant correlatable influences on the students' later price estimates. Those compelled to write \\"88\\" at the top of their papers would reliably estimate higher prices than those compelled to write \\"08\\" at the top of their papers, to a statistically significant degree.    Extrapolating to \\"real life.\\" Watching Fox News will tend to make you more conservative without you knowing it. Watching MSNBC news will tend to make you more liberal without you knowing it.     If you want to understand \\"real truth,\\" you are just going to have to do a little more than self-select your news feeds. You are going to have to seriously consider a diversity of viewpoints.    Moreover, if you have Social Darwinist beliefs as I once did, you may need to re-think the concept of the Poverty Trap. Early pre-conditioning really does make a difference.     Here is the way I think of it as an Engineer. Classical Economic Theory is analogous to Classical Newtonian Physics. There is nothing badly wrong with it, and it is a good approximation for most real world problems at the middle of the distribution.     However, General Relativity is indeed more correct that Classical Newtonian Physics, and the additional knowledge makes a real difference in certain special cases. And, those special cases are sometimes the really important ones. Likewise, Behavioral Economics is adding something very valuable to our knowledge of Classical Economics.     Read this only if you are brave enough to contemplate that the world might be a little more complex than we wish it were.
0307460444|4.0|My daughter and I tried the strawberry cupcakes today and they were delicious!  Recipe was easy to follow.  The Swiss Merinque Buttercream is excellent.  We will be using it from now on for cupcakes!  A little more labor intensive than a straight buttercream but well worth the effort.  We like how the sections were divided and organized within the book, also liked the pictures.    Aug 2011..have since also tried the Red Velvet which was really good and the s'mores cupcakes...which looked fantastic but were just okay taste wise.  My daughter has been baking out of this book quite a bit and finds it easy to follow and for the most part very good.

If a witness screws up and get themselves in a jam, Arnie \\"eliminates\\" the troublemakers who were trying to put away his witnesses and \\"erases\\" the witness with a new identity and location.<br /><br />The plot starts rolling when Arnie's boss tells him of a witness who is a whistleblower for the military defense company she works for.  She gets wired by the FBI and at this point you don't know who to trust.  Vanessa Williams plays the witness, Ms. Cullen, who gets herself involved in a government cover-up.  Unfortunately involved in the cover-up also includes the Undersecretary of Defense of the USA, and Arnold's boss, who is killing his own witnesses as a cover-up to get Arnold to reveal the whereabouts of Ms. Cullen.<br /><br />Interesting if convoluted plot as you sit through two hours of intrigue, unintentional comedy, interspersed with murder, lies and traitors.<br /><br />Arnold plays a tough, no-nonsense kinda guy, no one gets in his way, working through various life-threatening situations.  Vanessa's acting is a bit overdone; the former Miss America's try at stardom may be on the decline with this film.<br /><br />Mindless, non-stop action, impossible physical feats, and despite being shot, stabbed and thrown out of an airplane, Arnold wins at the end.  Whew!<br /><br />Rated R for the mature boys in your town.<br /><br />Recommended for the spy thriller it is, but a James Bond it's not.

B001EO748M|5.0|I guess I should not admit this but I watched the whole season in 2 days.  And then I was bummed that there weren't more episodes.  This is my favorite show on TV - everything is good from the music at the intro to the costumes and the way they talk to the court intrique and the two hotties, King Henry and his sidekick Charles. Love it - but my husband watched 5 minutes and said it was boring so I think you have to like dramas and period pieces.  Also, between season 1, 2 and 3 it seems almost everyone gets their heads cut off, so if you don't like to see heads roll it is not for you!

B0012GMV58|4.0|While most Santana fans - and most reviewers - tend to give CARAVANSERAI the nod over WELCOME, I actually prefer this 1973 set to its more airy-fairy predecessor. The return to an identifiable song cycle helps, rather than hinders, leader/guitarist Carlos Santana's efforts to merge jazz fusion and Latin rock, while the settled and tested band lineup - who recorded WELCOME in the midst of touring the world and had created the awe-inspiring LOTUS, which features superior \\"premakes\\" of several numbers from this collection, on stage in Japan just a few weeks earlier - gives the album a stronger, more consistent personality, as well as superior performances. A few silly lyrics notwithstanding, this is a tight and powerful entry in Santana's catalogue, and for my money a more successful stylistic stretch than CARAVANSERAI. I'd almost be tempted to give it five stars if not for the existence of the even better LOTUS, and can unreservedly recommend it to all Santana and/or fusion enthusiasts.
1934030198|4.0|I am a beginner in triathlon so I felt like I needed a comprehensive one-stop resource. I had already read Friel's \\"Your first Triathlon\\" and, while it was a useful introduction, I felt as though it was a little too \\"light\\". It was written for absolute beginners with the goal of simply finishing the race. Wanting more, I decided to buy this book. Well, it certainly provided the info I was looking for and then some! In fact, I found myself skipping large portions of the book because some of it was just too in depth for my level. I really like that it is based on the latest scienctific principles but it got a little boring at times. Also, if you have a job, it may be difficult to remain as dedicated to the training schedule as Joe would like you to be. However, it really does have tons of great info and would be useful even for beginners as a resource but it's probably more geared towards intermediate to advanced athletes.

0307408833|4.0|I got this book today and promptly made the chocolate cupcakes and attempted the chocolate frosting. I've been gluten-free for about a decade now so I already had many of the staples in her list in my pantry. I think coconut oil is the only item I needed to pick up, and I think that one is also going to be my nemesis in using this book. The cupcakes turned out fantastic. They taste great to me. The boyfriend, a wheat-eater, says they taste \\"like brownies\\". I'll do a couple things differently next time. First, I'm not going to turn the pan around 15 minutes into the cooking. All the cupcakes fell when I did that. I would have been better off leaving them alone for the full cooking time. Secondly, I'm going to tweak that chocolate frosting recipe. I followed the directions and ended up with chocolate soup. I suspect the 1.5 cups of unsweetened soy milk called for on page 93 should actually be 1.5 tablespoons. There is no way this could thicken up to a frosting-like consistency. I mean, I get that what we're going for here is a sort of modified mayonnaise, but it didn't work. Was it the humidity? A different brand of soy milk? I'm not sure, but I'm intrigued by the concept and I'll mess around with it until I get something that works.  THAT is the best thing about this cookbook for me. She's got some ideas about how to eliminate wheat, dairy, and sugar and still get something that looks like and tastes like a baked good. I'm delighted and looking forward to experimenting.   Word of warning, the entire muffin/scone section uses spelt, which doesn't work for us of the purist GF crowd. Who uses every recipe in a cookbook,though? I think it's worth the purchase for the many other recipes. I'm looking forward to her book #2.

Much of this is lovely playing and inspired music making, but I do not find her playing particularly feminine as does a previous reviewer. In fact, she has chosen to sometimes play a theme \\"pesante\\" (stomping) - an interpretive choice I don't like.  She also - particularly in some of the later variations - brings out motives in a hard, percussive manner which tends to obliterate all else.  The quodlibet starts out in a deliberate manner but gets soft and slow at its end, I assume to prepare the way for the restatement of the aria.  I find it a let-down and musically unsatisfying.  Still, she is not to be ignored in this repertoire.  For the Goldbergs on piano I prefer Gould I, Perahia, Shepkin and Schiff II.  If you want Nikolayeva playing these, there is a live BBC performance which many like and prefer to this studio recording.

Now I understand why this book is so popular and enduring.<br /><br />This is a fully engrossing story about a boy, zoo animals and survival.  There is also a parallel story.  In the end, businessmen select a story that fits their world view, but the reader doesn't have these restrictions.<br /><br />The story is charming and fun to read on its own.  The spiritual aspect is introduced, but could have been better developed.  The ending gives plenty of food for thought.
0385495323|5.0|\\"The Code Book\\" presents readers with a beautifully composed account of the history of cryptography.  It is written in such a way to keep the technically inclined satisfied without overloading the average reader.  Singh does an excellent job at presenting technical material.    This book maintains a high level of drama and excitement, constantly sparking imagination and occasionally encouraging readers to try their own hand at cryptography.    I definitely recommend this book to anyone remotely interested in history, information technology, or politics.  It's an excellent read.
B000005AYM|3.0|3 1/2    This noticeable debut can wear down a bit taken whole in some repetitious rhythms (and themes), though most were simply too focused on Badu's eccentric subtleties. Paired with its finely produced jazzy soul settings, and this vocalist offered a reputable fresh identity.
0060512806|5.0|The Cryptonomicon is a story told in two parts.  Each part separated by history.  These two parts are developed separately but intertwined within the story, each part supplying a critical piece.

Certainly a book \\"I can't put down\\"!

0679745203|5.0|Ondaatje, simply put, is one of our best living writers. He writes in seamless prose that could almost be called poetry. But unlike some writers who write beautifully but can't fashion it into a good story, Ondaatje has mastered both.  I won't bother going over the plot, plenty of people have done that, but the character studies are truly amazing. I know it's cliched to say \\"I felt like I was really there,\\" but this is one of the few books I've read where I can honestly say that.  Another thing I love about this book, and all of his books, is that I loved it the first time I read it, and I loved it even more the second time. He's one of the few writers where I can turn to the middle of one his books that I've already read and just be swept away again, reading several random pages and finding things I didn't notice before. A true modern masterpiece.

Looking for answers to a marriage in stress I agreed to read the book after being prompted by a person I respected. Now the first 9 tenth of the book were interesting but It was not until I had nearly finished that the light bulb became illuminated. I will never look at relationships the same way again. It all makes sense now. I would go as far as to say, no one should be granted a marriage license until they read this book. I will go on step further, couples that have read this book and are considering starting a family should read the book a second time to prepare themselves for the new roll they will lead as parents.

1932100660|5.0|I'd been recommended this book by about 15 people, but always put off getting it because the title made it sound like a snooze fest.  One day I found it lying in someone's home and read the first 8 pages.  It was so engaging that I when I got home I ordered it off of Amazon.    I've been interested in health for a long time and it always amazes me that after 8 years of trying to digest all the material that comes my way there was so much in this book I had no clue about.  In fact, almost the entire thing was a revelation.    I'd been eating pretty much a vegetarian diet before this book, although due to weight lifting I made heavy use of whey protein isolates.  I scratched my head when my last blood test showed my cholesterol was 197 and my LDL was 114.  Given that I exercised a lot, and ate very healthy (I thought), and have low bodyfat I thought it would look much better.    I just got my last test back after switching over to being vegan.  My LDL fell in half (51%) to 56 and my cholesterol nose dived 71 points to 126.  Oh, so I guess the animal protein did make a difference after all.    This book would get 5 stars just for containing all the information it does.  It could also get 5 stars for keeping its readers interested and curious the entire way.  As a bonus to all of this, the 2nd half of the book deals with why this information isn't widely disseminated and why public health information is so confusing in general.      Refreshingly, it's not some quacky conspiracy theory.  The authors just lay out how a web of institutions with their own self interests can create a system where they advance their own agenda at the cost of the public whom they are intended to serve.  There's nothing sinister about it, and it's entirely to be expected once you are given the insider's view of how the tangled mess all fits together.  It's sobering nonetheless, and rounds out what is a great read start to finish.
0307454541|5.0|I read them in French before they were translated into English. They took France by storm also.

B000YABIQ6|3.0|I think this show is very well produced and it's premise and setting is promising, but it's not a patch on the quality of a program like 'The Sopranos', from where it's creator Matt Weiner hails as a writer. I was initially disappointed in the 'stylized' performances in Mad Men as, in the wake of the Sopranos, I found the prospect of a realistically performed collection of early sixties characters very exciting. Unfortunately, despite the darker themes of the program, it is really a series of TV performances (ie the way we imagine 1960's characters to behave via our experience of their television). Thus there is no cursing, no genuine intimacy and a strange contrivance about all involved. It's a shame, especially when you can see a film like 'Revolutionary Road' pulling off just the sort of honesty and performance style that we might hope for from Mad Men. Other than that the program suffers from strangely judgmental moments, and others cloyingly obvious and Spielberg-esque. The Sopranos was never guilty of either of these crimes.<br /><br />For judging, take the 'easy' criticism of the hippie characters that Draper visits (and dowses them with the predictable 'Get a job' criticism) - actually some of their criticisms of Draper were very interesting but they were marred by obvious, cliched portrayals of hippies. If Draper had've witnessed a Dylan concert in the Village or something nearing it's quality, he might have felt very inferior indeed. As it is, he has to sit through poetry so bad, only a cynical scriptwriter could've prepared it.<br /><br />For cloying, witness the awful flashbacks to Draper's childhood, portrayed with such obvious message-mongering they border on condescension of the audience. Yes, we get it, Draper's dad was a 'bad man'. The most obvious shortfall of the program is it's inability to deliver us genuinely sympathetic and involving characters. The closest are Peggy and Draper's wife - but even they are basically shallow puppets caught up in the oh so important world of advertising. The show has two big things going for it; It's early 60's style is fresh and it has learned from The Sopranos that unpredictability is a compelling way to explore an ensemble cast. Other than that, time will get the better of this program.rtant world of advertising.

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I heard the devastating news of Michael's passing on the radio as I drove from work. At the age of 50 he died very prematurely. As I digested this devastating news I reflected on his influence in my own life. I owned Thriller when it first came out on vinyl. I had never heard anything that sounded like it before. As for the videos a whole new level of skill,talent and showmanship had just opened in front of our eyes.  Then my 26 Year old son gave me and his mother an anniversary present of this album a few months ago. We watched the video that comes with it and listened to all his songs. I have played those songs over and over again. They sound fresh each and every time. Thriller is an amazing album and goes into the annals of history forever. I recalled the Jackson 5 as a teenager. I grew up on their music and owned most works of MJ.  Michael was the king of Pop. He is dead but for most of us he lives on forever as the greatest gift to the world of music in modern times. The world is poorer for his loss but it's also enriched by the legacy of this talented genius of our time.  Michael rest in peace. Long Live The King!
B00005QGAT|5.0|This is Michael's first hit album. I love the classic hits \\"Rock With You\\",  \\"She's Out Of My Life\\" and the title track.  I also like \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\\",  \\"Get On the Floor\\" and \\"Workin Day and Night\\".  \\"Burn This Disco Out\\" is not considered a hit song, but it is a groovy jam to me.  \\"Girlfriend\\" is a smooth cut.  I really like this song.  The music on this album is timeless.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Michael's spirit lives on through the vast musical legacy he created for us. There is something for everyone, beginning with the Jackson 5 years. I refuse to entertain the personal issues...that is done. He LIVED the consequences of bad choices which includes having the vultures around him \\"advising\\" him. I cannot imagine what it was like to live his path...living with such infinite talent yet feeling so lonely and depressed. I was always a fan though even when it wasn't cool and forever more will be. Now it's time to celebrate the AMAZING, genius he was. Off The Wall will help you do just that. Freshman year of college, I wrote an analysis of this album and earned an A+. It's just that good, the entire album. Reasearch has proven music heals the soul. Peace and healing to his children, parents, siblings and those of us who love him.
B00000JXVK|5.0|This was and is by far the movie that catapulted the real image of motorcycling without all the hollywood hype of gangs and mahem.

B0016Q2D5M|3.0|We have seen Brendan Fraser movies at only maintained the title and not the meat of the true story, such as \\"The Mummy\\", who does not look a thing like Peter Cushing (1959). Now we are presented with \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth.\\"  However, this movie does give us a good synopsis of the story.  Moreover, it is very much fun to watch.<br /><br />Prof. Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) has lost a brother. Professor Anderson's nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has lost a father. Well circumstances force them to spend some time together.  They realize that they might be able to find the lost Max Anderson and make a trip to Iceland in pursuit.  They are bigger and across the tasty mountain guide Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (Anita Briem), who has recently lost her father.  Both Hannah's father, and Trevor's brother had one thing in common; they were Vernians. So all three each bringing their own unique talents, set off to find the lost Max Anderson.<br /><br />I first watched the 2D version of this movie in Blu-ray high definition.  Some of the scenes were quite beautiful, such as the diamonds that had the lights behind them, so they would glisten in the cave.  The movie did look a little bit like it was cranked out at the last minute with many things not thought out.  However, it was still fun for the time that it lasted.<br /><br />Now it was time to watch the 3-D version.  I put on my trusty red and green glasses that came with the DVD.  I must say I am not sure why they switched from red and blue, to red and green.  However, it might have something to do with the fact that televisions are made up of three colors of light red, green, and blue.  The military also change their lighting from red at night light to green night light for some reason.  Therefore, we are not aware of something afoot.  In any event, it took about 15 seconds to get used to the new color environment.  In addition, I must say that some of the scenes are spectacular.  The trilobite at first may be halved almost at back of the seat. Of course, with the exception of the color change the technology has not changes since the origins of 3D. Other scenes instead of extending out into the viewer's space recessed back and looked like the old stereoscopic slides. Occasionally there looked like a pane of glass with a reflection of what was behind it. I am not sure if this was sloppy manufacturing or beyond the technology even of today.  No matter the problem, it is well worth the viewing and I hope this will catch on as an industry option.<br /><br />This comes with a digital download. I have not tried it yet. I have watched the picture in picture voice over which added to the second viewing.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1603400281 \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" by Jules Verne]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001JI0JDA 3D GLASSES - Journey to the Center of the Earth DVD Extra 3D Glasses (3 Pairs)]]may be halved almost at back of the seat.

B00000099Y|5.0|I am really confused by all the negative reviews Tool generates, mostly by intellectual baffoons who just want to show that they know how to use dialogue that most Tool fans won't even understand, much less care about.   Honestly, it comes off more like self-loathing than a music review.  Tool is not for everyone, but they work very hard at what they do, and I think they do a pretty good job at it.
B00102FELM|5.0|One of the longest running acts in heavy metal, the Scorpions, celebrate both their long history, and some of their most beloved past members, in this 2006 performance at the famed Wacken outdoor arena in Hamburg, Germany.  Billed as `A Night to Remember, A Journey Through Time', the 138 minute performance features guest appearances by past members Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker and Herman Rarebell.  The set list was partially based on input from the fans, and features many of the classics, with a few surprise selections.<br /><br />The departure of Ulrich Roth in 1978, was a turning point in the band's history, and under the creative direction of singer Klaus Meine, and guitarist Rudolf Schenker, and with the contributions of Mathias Jabs on lead guitar, Scorpions found commercial success in the 80's.  Given the past, the presence of Roth is one of the highlights of the evening.  The Scorpions open the show alone, and then bring Roth onstage for `Pictured Life'.  `Speedy's Coming' takes you back to Roth's earliest times, and he really cuts loose on `We'll Burn the Sky'.  The sound of Roth's Sky guitar is at times rather thin, and isn't always well heard.  The sound mix is good but not great.  At times, the highs don't seem to cut through like they should, and Klaus's vocals are sometimes drowned out.<br /><br />Roth departs, and after a few more songs, Michael Schenker is brought on, doing a very slowed down version of Coast to Coast, where Klaus also joins in on guitar.  Big brother Rudolf shows off his skills on an acoustic flying V, on a very resonant version of Holiday, where the guitars really are heard.  The editing style that is characterized by cuts every few seconds, gets annoying after a while.  Although the presentation includes a wide variety of views, the video is often not that sharp.  Again good, but not great.  Lovedrive, and Another Piece of Meat finishes Michael's featured portion of the show, during which, due to the editing, he really isn't seen very much.  When the guitar player isn't given appropriate screen time when soloing, there's an issue.<br /><br />It's very cool to see Herman Rarebell join the band to play drums on Blackout and No One Like You.  For Blackout, Rudolph dons a mask with forks in the eyes, like the Blackout album cover, and plays a guitar that emits smoke through exhaust pipes.  Give the man some credit for showmanship, as the rest of the band is doesn't do too much to spice things up.<br /><br />Matthias Jabs, solid throughout the performance, with his signature screams, squeaks, and squeals, then takes the stage for a short guitar solo, before taking the band into `Big City Nights'.  Rudolph's classic guitar solo is lost in the editing.  `Still Loving You' is almost magical when performed live, with more emotion from Rudolph's guitar in the outro.<br /><br />Uli, Michael, and Herman all return for two more numbers.  `In Trance', is an another journey way, way back, and features some impressive work by Roth and Jabs.  Probably the most curious number is `Bolero', which not only features lots of Uli's guitar, but also Rudolf performing a headstand onstage.  The performance winds up with the appearance on a mechanical scorpion on stage, followed by a rousing version of `Rock You Like a Hurricane'.<br /><br />The special guests, and songs from the 70's and 80's, are excellent reasons to check out this performance.  The choppy editing detracts from the enjoyment, and the sound mix could have been better at times, but the performance is still well worth seeing, as the Scorpions are very much in synch, playing for over two hours.  Klaus Meine's voice is still one of the finest, and the evening is a marvelous journey through the band's long history.hen the guitar player isn't given appropriate screen time when soloing, there's an issue.

1590710487|5.0|I first noticed John Belushi when I was about 15 years old. I was watching Saturday Night Live and the Star Trek parody with John as Captain Kirk came on, and Belushi nailed the impersonation and it was so funny it made me choke on the ham sandwich I was eating. After that Saturday Night Live (it wasn't SNL yet) became something to watch and John's performances were stand out from the killer bees, the samurai, the diner cheeezborger cook, all were skits I wanted to see. When John went onto movies I went to see Animal House, 1941, The Blues Brothers, Neighbors. And one spring day in 1982 as I was leaving work I turned on my car radio and the first thing that came out of the speakers that afternoon was that John Belushi had died in L.A. and I said to myself `I hope it wasn't drugs.' It's stories like these that give oral biographies like Belushi: A Biography their power, the first hand accounts of the participants that give the account it's flesh and blood and if done right, provides more verisimilitude than the standard biography.<br /><br />Belushi: A Biography was written by Judy Belushi Pisano and Tanner Colby, Judy is John's widow, and you can tell this was a labor of love not only for Judy but for all the friends, relatives, teachers, cohorts and colleagues who share their stories of the time they spent with John and how he influenced their lives. Just about anybody who you can think of from SNL, National Lampoon, guest hosts, people from the movies both in front of and behind the camera, and anyone from any part of John's life share their stories. Of course Dan Aykroyd, Judy Belushi, Harold Ramis, John's mother, Jim Belushi, John Landis, Bill Murray, Robin Williams, Bernie Brillstein, Buck Henry, Steve Martin, Lorne Michaels, Tom Davis, Anne Beatts, Richard Belzer, you name a person they probably show up in here. And of course the book is filled with high quality pictures of John and Judy, a lot of them unseen and some breathtaking such as the picture on the opening page which shows John in an open field on a sunny day his arms raised to take in and be alive in the moment.<br /><br />John Belushi was  a larger than life person and a book can't really contain all that was John Belushi the flesh and blood person but Belushi comes closest, and the force of John`s life is ably transmitted through the pictures and words of his friends.<br /><br />If you have read other reviews of mine you know I really like the oral biography. It isn't easily pulled off but when it's done right they make for a great biography!

B000000H40|5.0|\\"Cause of Death\\" sounds rather different than Obituary's debut album \\"Slowly We Rot\\". Whereas their debut was essentially a 40 minute blast of stripped-down, raw death metal, but still an extreme metal essential, \\"Cause of Death\\" takes things into a more progressive, technical, and shall I even say a classier state of being.    \\"Cause of Death\\" showcases Obituary playing longer, more epic-sounding songs with a much more technical aspect to them. Progressive songwriting is also very abundant here. In fact, I would say that this is to death metal what Metallica's \\"...And Justice To All\\" is to thrash metal.    In addition, James Murphy, formerly of the band Death, is the lead guitarist on this album. His leads and solos add much more depth to this album than what was demonstrated on \\"Slowly We Rot\\". On this album, the guitar solos are less chaotic and random, and instead more classically influenced, melodic and technical. This makes the album even better.    Overall, \\"Cause of Death\\" is another classic death metal album, and an astounding relase from \\"Obituary\\". My only complaint here is the unnecessary cover of Celtic Frost's \\"Circle of the Tyrants\\". Honestly, I think that song is covered too much, but still Obituary's cover of it is a great one. And by the way, be sure to get this album in the 2-for-1 deal with \\"Slowly We Rot\\". It'll save money and it gives you more Obituary music faster! Well, that about wraps up this review, but still, I can't wait for when the band releases \\"Darkest Day\\" in just a few days! Thanks for the time, and peace.

Do not get me wrong, this is a good book, but if you've never programmed before, skip it otherwise you will start hating C and programming -at least that's what happened with my colleagues. I recommend Ivor Horton's book on C, from Apress - \\"C. From novice to professional\\". The book is exceptional, in my opinion. After you've read it and understood the concepts there (pointers, structures etc) than you can pick up \\"The C Programming Language\\" by Kernighan and Ritchie. Hope this helps!
B00005JLWN|3.0|I rented this movie at the behest of my 13 year old.  I made sure that it was acceptable for his age level first, then agreed to it.<br /><br />A lot of people compare this to Fahrenheit 451 or 1984.  To my way of thinking it was a cross between Fahrenheit 451 and Logan's Run meets Revenge of the Sith in reverse with Vulcans in control.<br /><br />The storyline is a rehash, really, of Fahrenheit 451 and that's fine as the Bradbury novel was written in 1953.  A do over with slightly different plotting makes sense.  But the movie really kind of lacks originality, something that will make your head turn off to look out the window in deep thought while saying, \\"wow.\\"  It's all rather predictable.<br /><br />Except for one thing.  The ultimate combat scene did not drag out like the one between Anakin and Obi-Wan.  It was over in a couple seconds, and I actually rather liked that.<br /><br />The acting was good, natural, nothing forced.  There was a sufficient amount of action.  But at the end of the movie, all I could think was, \\"so what?\\"<br /><br />I can see how it would be liked by a 13 year old.<br /><br />To it's credit, it avoids language and sexual content beyond a mild reference.  The violence is to be expected in its format, though the face of Taye Diggs sliding off was rather disturbing.<br /><br />That's my take on it.  I don't recommend it, but I don't disrecommend it either.  I'll leave that up to you.

067101756X|5.0|This work is very detailed and interesting to say the very least. It fills in a lot of spaces for me and dots many I's and crosses the TTs on questions I was asking for many years. Although it leaves a few questions unanswered this should not disuade anyone to read it. I have found no reason to debunk the author's work or his perspective on the UFO technology mystery. His perspective was very refreshing and informative.

B00005JPAO|5.0|\\"Nowadays, people want glamour and tears, the grand performance. I'm not very good at that. I never have been. I prefer to keep my feelings to myself.\\"  -- Queen Elizabeth II<br /><br />Retaining the dignified privacy that's typical of England's royal family versus showing feelings to an upset and saddened British public that craves monarchial comfort and emotion -- those are the difficult options facing Queen Elizabeth II after Princess Diana's sudden death in this spellbinding movie starring Helen Mirren.<br /><br />Following Diana's death, it's a clash of old-world thinking from the queen and her entourage, up against the newly elected Tony Blair, a \\"modern\\" and forward-thinking politician who hopes to revolutionize England. In Blair's corner are the people of Great Britain, who loved Diana and now scorn the queen's reluctance to display remorse after the princess' untimely death. In a world filled with 24-hour news cycles and wear-your-heart-on-your-sleeve reality TV shows, the public desires an appearance from Queen Elizabeth II to put a stamp on memorializing the \\"people's princess.\\"<br /><br />But the queen has a mindset and a long history of her own, not all of it regal, and she isn't easily pigeonholed. A former mechanic in World War II and a lover of the outdoors and dogs, Queen Elizabeth II defies convenient stereotype. Though initially her airs reek of snobbishness, Elizabeth is actually a down-to-earth, razor-sharp gal who's filled with the same range of humanity that all of us possess and truly loves and believes in her country. Observing her interaction with people and during personal moments is fascinating and hearkens back to a bygone era that valued familial privacy, honor, restraint and proper decorum.<br /><br />Nuance abounds from Blair as his relationship with the queen evolves and he begins to view her less as an archaic figurehead and more as a noble leader who in many ways can't help her mentality and circumstances. Blair, who starts his term as prime minister a bit in awe of the queen's presence, delicately begins to open up and make suggestions to assist with her predicament of holding on to private family grief versus showing her face to the people of England. Ultimately, though there are some critical words along the way, both the increasingly confident Blair and the staid, honorable queen show themselves to be compromising leaders who only want to do what's right for their country.<br /><br />This glimpse into privileged worlds is made even better by stellar acting by everyone involved. Michael Sheen is practically a carbon copy of the real Tony Blair; Mirren won an Academy Award for her performance as Queen Elizabeth II; and everyone else, from the boorish James Crommwell (the Queen's husband) to the stately Roger Allam (the Queen's adviser) to the brusquely opinionated Helen McCrory (Blair's wife), were spectacular in their roles.a bit in awe of the queen's presence, delicately begins to open up and make suggestions to assist with her predicament of holding on to private family grief versus showing her face to the people of England.

0757302661|3.0|Bought this book along with two private lessons from a certified Mongan instructor. Learned some good meditations/visualizations, practiced some -but as a FT working mom with a 5-yr-old found it hard to find time to really go deep into the program. Thus on the day of labor I wasn't able to get very far with the self-hypnosis itself, especially as this birth went relatively quickly (5 hours). I ended up relying mostly on my midwife's very good guidance. I did not use drugs of any kind, which felt great, despite the pain. ...Having said that, all of the time that I DID put into breathing/hypnosis practice DEFINITELY helped give me a \\"center\\" place to work from, and a goal to strive for. I felt much more confident and empowered going into labor than I did with my first (also drug free but a lot more STRESSFUL.) I would consider this book one of many tools available, and like anything, will likely give you back only as much as you can put into it. Good labor to you!

When it was verified, one girl just completely broke down & I happened to be the closest to her, so I held her tenderly for a few. Comforting her seemed to ease my own pain. But I was still in Trippsville. How could this have happened? Yet I must accept it as the working out of Allah's Divine Will & Purpose. Michael Jackson's death will be the topic of conversation for the next few months if not years.      Yes, he was a natural born genius. Yes, he was a critical component of what we call \\"POP\\" (BLACK MUSIC) today. But what is his true legacy? For me first it will always be the early recordings, although the later recordings are also astounding. Michael's songs connect you to raw emotion & authentic truths. That is why the people love him. Sometimes there are no words...it's a case of \\"SCENIC ECLIPSE\\" each song eclipsing the former, yet the former songs becoming standards in their own right. Standards that no one but Michael can attain. The mark of true genius.      Michael was one of the last great ones in a long line of Black Musical geniuses including Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, Sammy Davis Jr., Beethoven, Stevie Wonder, James Brown, Nina Simone, Aretha Franklin, Eubie Blake, Mozart, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, etc., whose musical truths shone so brilliantly, than even in a racist world, they were able to make a connection based on their authentic musical genius. Michael Jackson left a immense legacy, & will be sorely missed, but do not fret....there are even greater ones coming....Diamonds in the rough....coming from from the despised & the rejected, coming from a Black Woman's Womb, as did Michael. They tried to destroy you Michael, because you dared to speak out against the racism you observed in the World & in the Music Industry perpetrated by both Jews & Anglos & their Black puppets, but they were unsuccessful. Don't worry, Jermaine will continue to sound that trumpet. Despite that, you still got the Beatles Catalog. My Man! Man makes plans, but Allah is the Best of Planners. WHOSE LOVING YOU, MICHAEL? We All Are. May Allah Bless You.
B001VPJYZK|1.0|The Fifth Season was overall kinda flat. The time jump did nothing for the series at all, and the mystery (if that's what you would even call it) was pathetic in every way. Worst of all, many storylines were picked up and then just randomly dropped out of nowhere.The season had a perfect chance to reinvent itself and it failed miserably. Gaby had the same kind of story for what, the first 15 episodes, minus the story about Carlos's boss and wife? Susan is ridiculous for all 24 episodes. The stories were just rehashed versions of what we have already seen in seasons past, Lynette suspecting Tom of cheating, again, etc. It was all just one stupid mistake after the next. Katherine turned into a weak and pathetic bimbo.  They should have killed her off instead of Edie. The mystery is solved after Episode 1 and only relies on 1 plot-point from episode 11 to 24. You know how in earlier seasons, DH would make viewers think one thing and then out of nowhere near the finale it goes a different way and leaves you in shock? And how it constantly keeps you guessing? Well people were constantly guessing and predicting something bigger was lurking because nobody could believe that the mystery was that obvious from the first episode. Guess what? It was. No jaw-dropping moments. The season was horrible all together, nothing important happened. They had a brilliant chance to start over and failed. The writers must have been on a strike of their own this season, or in a coma.

0743454537|4.0|The book was amazing first of all and the movie, excellent! I loved that the book came so quickly so I had plenty of time to read it before going to see the movie! :)
B00275EGWO|5.0|The movie opens with the quote - \\"the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug\\"  (a modern paraphrase of Churchill's older and more famous maxim - \\"there is nothing more exhilarating than to be shot at without result\\")<br /><br />This is a thriller of a movie about a U.S. Army bomb disposal unit in Iraq and their daily grind in dealing with the IEDs and insurgents there.<br /><br />This movie does have several stars - but Ralph Fiennes, Guy Pierce, and Evangeline Lilly all have fairly small roles.  Blink, and you'll miss them.  Their presence in this movie is more a testament to director/producer Kathryn Bigelow's status in the entertainment industry than anything else.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner is Sergeant James, a bomb tech.  Unlike his affable predecessor, he is a wild man.  He seems not only indifferent to the dangers of his job, he absolutely revels in the dangers.  It is the ultimate in thrill seeking behavior, getting that dopamine surge in his brain.  Near the end of the movie, Sgt. James gets accused of being an adrenaline junkie, but we know now that the neurochemical at work here is dopamine.  Bomb disposal is not just a job for him, but his passion, his addiction, his reason for being in the Army.<br /><br />Renner's character ends up like a cross between Elmer Fudd, with his perpetually placid and slightly befuddled gaze, and Bugs Bunny, with his wile and lust for excitement and danger.<br /><br />His two partners in the unit, Sgt. Sanborn and Specialist Eldridge, who have to cover him and just want to survive their tour of duty, don't know quite how to deal with his determination to confront danger.  One wonders at why Sgt. James puts himself in danger, why he takes the extra risks to defuse a bomb when detonating it would do.  The scene that explains it all is when Sgt. James returns home to America one day and we see him doing the mundane chores of life as a civilian, cleaning out the rain gutters, cleaning up the kitchen, shopping with his wife and baby at the grocery store.  As he stares at an entire wall full of colorful cereal boxes stacked along a grocery store aisle,  a look of utter blankness, boredom, and despair fills his face.....nope, not for him, this dull life as a civilian....<br /><br />The movie's storyline is a series of daily missions, almost like a documentary or a TV series, each episode standing alone and yet building upon previous episodes, each one presenting a new danger, a new challenge, another piece of the puzzle that is the war in Iraq.<br /><br />What makes this movie work is the recreation of Iraq in this movie - it was filmed in Jordan with local Iraqi expatriates.  We feel the oppressive tension of the whole country, of not knowing who the bad guys are and where the next bomb or bullet is going to come  from.  We feel the fear and uncertainty of the American soldiers, caught between their desire to be the good guys and wanting to make nice with the local Iraqis,  while constantly needing to remain vigilant and suspicious,  never knowing who is a good Iraqi, and who deserves to get shot.  We feel the bewilderment and resentment of the local Iraqis, who get pushed around at every turn by the American soldiers.<br /><br />Unlike so many other recent Iraq war movies, this movie makes no political statements, there is no right or wrong here.  These are just men at work, doing a dangerous and dirty job, and these guys are darn good at what they do for their country, whatever the reasons are that they are doing it.ife and baby at the grocery store.

B00000K3D4|1.0|This is without a doubt the worst thing to ever molest my eyeballs. The only thing that could make the treacherous expirience worse was seeing that people actually enjoyed it.     This movie is easily summarized by three elements; obscenely tight pants, mind-blowingly hideous and disturbing puppetry with obnoxious voice actors, and horrific acting by the only people in the film.     I could live the rest of my life in absolute peace knowing that I would never watch this again. I would never put this atrocity in front of a child's eyes as suggested by some (possibly crazed) reviewers. This film is simply not suitable for anyone and if you should ever come across a copy you must destroy it immediately if you have any love for humankind.

B00002663R|5.0|i was not aware of the number of music critics our US has, (and other counties,) out there  although since there are so many, it seems they could be kept busy criticizing the truly vulgar music? that most of us are exposed to everyday.  as we drive down the street (please, light- don't turn RED) or sit in our yards.  if any of the critics are unemployed maybe they could get jobs as critics.  there seems to be enough i am sure it would lower our unemployment rate.  Michael Jackson will always be \\"king of pop\\" just as Elvis will always be \\"the king\\".  i do not like any of Elvis' music, but who am i to say what people should listen to.  i do think we have lost the most talented entertainer of our generation, just as past generations have felt the loss of their own.  and, even thought i do not know anything about music except if i like it or not, i have always been amazed by Michael Jackson's music (all of it, i grew up with the Jackson 5 & The Osmond's, posters and all).  but Thriller...the songs, his incredible dancing.  it's a very sad time for many of us as we have lost a legend.
0425220931|3.0|I read this book cover to cover. It was a pretty easy read and easily could be done during lunch breaks and the like over a small amount of time. I was hoping for some real insight from one of the worlds best bass players and how he developed his technique. And that exactly is what you don't get from this book. Instead you get a metaphysical type of 'i got home and look who was inside playing a guitar' ... 'an eleven year old was the best bass player i ever heard and who knows where he came from'... 'a book was peeking out of a bag that wasn't mine'..and other statements that he freely admits isn't sure if they are fact or fiction.<br />My problem is this: he states that \\"michael\\" jammed w/ him (and the house band) on stage before. So is he real? The kid left a drum machine behind .. so was he real? Uncle clyde w/ his harmonica, etc .. It is just too much of a stretch to pass this off as 'could be fiction' when material goods are left behind and other people see them in public places jamming. and he doesn't like bluegrass but he plays w/ possibly the worlds greatest bluegrass banjo player??<br />If I want metaphysics I'll go Alex Grey rather than this. We need some facts! Almost forgot to mention that this award winning bassist basically tells you to just go by 'feel' and to not really worry about practicing your instrument too much. Not what i would of expected to read...
B001PA0FFO|4.0|It is always a pleasure to see great actors who excel at their art and doubt is one perfect example of that.  This is a movie where you have to pay attention to what the actors are saying as there are not silly things blowing up and doing other things.  As usual Phillip Seymour Hoffman is superb in his role as the progressive Father Flynn. Meryl Streep and Amy Adams tend to be a bit of side plays but Streep really excels in her performance with Hoffman during the confrontation scene in her office.     This is a well acted story and one that given events of a few years ago is still timely and relevant. The title gives great insight into the film's flow as we all have doubt and even at the end of the film there is doubt regarding Flynn's innocence or not and Sister Alyousis's \\"proof\\".    A well done and thoughtful film.
B00297FEUI|3.0|Well, this is an overall good score. Yet, it would have been excellent if it's release would have been prior to Hans Zimmer's King Arthur. \\"Prime's\\" theme is too similar for my likings to Hans Zimmer's theme played at the end of \\"Woad to Ruin\\" or \\"All of Them\\" from King Arthur.    Really, I know that Steve Jablonsky was Zimmer's apprentice, but it is because of Jablonsky's lack of originality that I listened to this score and decided not to buy it, even though it's fairly good (yet, King Arthur is way better). During these last months, the most notable original scores, in my opinion, have been: The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (Alexandre Desplat), Angels & Demons (Hans Zimmer), Terminator Salvation (Danny Elfman) and Up (Michael Giacchino).    If you don't have many works of Hans Zimmer, then by all means, buy this one. But if you are like me, who have almost every Zimmer score, the truly powerful parts of this soundtrack may sound too familiar to other soundtracks from your collection...    I hope to hear more from Jablonsky, but I also hope that he finds his own style without trying too hard to sound like his mentor.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Michael Jackson was our generation's Elvis Presley. He could move and sing like nobody else before him. He was an icon, a legend, a mystery, almost godlike on stage where fans would pass out from the excitement. His professional life and genius cannot be forgotten. This album will probably always be the best-selling album, record, cassette, compact disc for the rest of my life as far as I know.     This was the Michael Jackson that the world rediscovered and fell in love with all over again. He was no longer a member of the Jacksons singing group or the Jackson Five. He always outshined his older brother, Jermaine, Tito, Randy, and Jackie with his soft-spoken voice and singing talents.    This was his second album that was produced by Quincy Jones. His first album was a considerable achievement but Thriller has mesmerized and changed musical history forever. It wasn't just the songs, but his moves, and his videos like Billie Jean, Beat It, and Thriller which had parental warning before the screening and was considered controversial in 1983.  Thriller made unbelievable records in sales and with the hits rolling out.  Michael Jackson passed away yesterday at the age of 50 years old.     His personal life overshadowed his professional achievements. We all knew he was a troubled individual from the tabloids and news stories. But somehow yesterday, I finally had to forgive him because it made no sense in judging him anymore. I felt guilty for owning his record that I gave it away a few years ago.     I hope he has finally found peace and thanks for giving us great hits and songs that made us all dance and try to imitate you. There will always be imitators but only one Michael Jackson.    He never repeated the same success after Thriller but then again, nobody else has come close to that achievement and that is a remarkable one.     I'm going to remember you not for your personal problems but for the dancing, moves, and the songs. Onstage, you were loved by your audienceswho longed to see you come back. Offstage, you were a lonely manchild. I hope you know how loved you really were in life.

0316017922|4.0|The book presents a series of interesting facts about the background and factors that contribute to persons being successful, however, it feels like the author fails to tie all of these stories together and rather tells about isolated stories of successful people and the circumstances in which they became successful.  In other words, if you take it as what it is, i.e. the narration of interesting factors that contributed to the success of a group of chosen individuals, it is a great book, entertaining and mind-opening, but other than that, don't expect to get anything more than that from it.
0679735909|5.0|This is the second time that I use a Thomas Browne quote taken from the reviewed book as headline for a book review here. First time was for Sebald's Rings of Saturn. That book has with this one more things in common than Browne: both contain extensive walks through English countrysides. (Maybe it is time for me to look at Browne himself; if others keep quoting him, there must be something.)<br /><br />Byatt's labyrinthine Possession is of comparable erudition and of amazing versatility. I was tempted to call it excessively versatile. I am still considering to find this book too much of a `head birth' (the German Kopfgeburt may not quite work in direct translation, so maybe I should just say: too brainy). It is the kind of book that I enjoy reading, but that does not rock my boat in the way that my recent first encounters with writers like Kis, Sebald, Oe, Murakami did.<br /><br />The author invents 2 Victorian poets, complete with life and works, some of it integrated into the narration, and an affair. And the whole is told us by following modern day lit-historians working as history sleuths in their scramble for the bits and pieces from the lives of their objects of study. The detection work leads to historical mysteries and to romance in different time zones.<br /><br />Protagonists are two unlikely couples: the first consists of an unemployed postgraduate researcher in London, who starts the chain of events with a sensational (?) find of a manuscript of a letter draft in a library archive, and a wealthy aristocratic attractive lecturer in Lincoln (England), who gets drawn into this, because her specialty is the poetess who seems to have had a fling with the poet who is the specialty of our poor researcher. Whether they become a real couple as opposed to two people is one of the questions that keeps suspense open.<br /><br />The two poets of the past are the other couple. Also there: were they really a couple? Wasn't she a Lesbian? Wasn't he a devoted and loyal husband? Deep and rare questions.<br /><br />The time of the historical couple is insufficiently described as Victorian. One needs to specify that it is post-`Origin of Species' Victorian. Poet Ash is a rationalist whose world view is coming to grips with new paradigms; he is a fighter against quackeries like Mesmerism and the spiritism which was so popular in those days. His target of affection is more on the religious side of looking at things, and the two dance around the involved problems and potential conflicts with admirable sensitivity.<br /><br />Other people add color. There is the surprisingly named Professor Blackadder. The professor is however far away from his inspirational namesake, the man impersonated by Mr.Bean in a TV series that used to amuse me when I still watched TV. This Blackadder is a false trail.<br /><br />More amusing is Professor Cropper, a gentleman researcher from the US. His texts contribute a lot to the story. He is amusingly dislikable, as are some other personalities of the literary scene.<br />Watching these professional literature analyzers at work, as they are shown by Byatt, I am so happy that I decided long ago not to choose this profession.<br /><br />And a footnote to all Vikings around here: a part of the imaginary world of this complex text is set in Iceland! One of poet Ash's major works is a verse epos called Ragnaroek. Just as a teaser for fans of things Nordic.The time of the historical couple is insufficiently described as Victorian.

More amusing is Professor Cropper, a gentleman researcher from the US. His texts contribute a lot to the story. He is amusingly dislikable, as are some other personalities of the literary scene.  Watching these professional literature analyzers at work, as they are shown by Byatt, I am so happy that I decided long ago not to choose this profession.    And a footnote to all Vikings around here: a part of the imaginary world of this complex text is set in Iceland! One of poet Ash's major works is a verse epos called Ragnaroek. Just as a teaser for fans of things Nordic.

0812974611|4.0|Although I enjoy historical fiction involving Roman era life I'm often overwhelmed by the excess of detail that can drown out the overall story.  Thankfully 'Pompeii' is not this sort of novel.  The author focuses on prose and characterizations.  His descriptions of Roman era life, while seemingly well researched, are not overwhelming.  And so this book reads well; it would actually make for a good beach read.    Now as for the story, it's somewhat disappointing.  It concerns with the engineer responsible for maintaining the aquaduct that feeds water to Pompeii and neighboring communities.  When the aquaduct fails he is brought in to investigate and correct the situation.  But he soon faces all sorts of obstacles.  Oh, and he falls in love.  Then Vesuvius erupts and, well, ... you what happens.  Again this is not the most engaging of stories.  But it captured this reader's interest for the most part.      Bottom line: fluffy historical fiction is not a bad thing.  Recommended.

B001RIY4WE|1.0|Unless you want to see only the logo, make sure your player is connected to the Internet. Also make sure your firmware is up to date. For me the price is too high. You should at least have the option of watching just the Blu-Ray movie and commentary without Internet access.<br /><br />The movie is one of the sci-fi greats of all time, but the technology is getting a bit old. When I first saw the bullet impact scenes, I thought, wow, how cool is that? Now I see just a bunch of metal buttons on the T2.<br /><br />The sound and visual impact of the movie is terrific, but skip this version. It's too fussy. It shouldn't have to rely on Internet connectivity to work.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never been motivated to review a product on this site before BUT I love this video.  I run intervals nearly every day and boredom had set in.  This is a terrific workout -- After two weeks my upper body strength is improving and my ability to lunge is a whole new game (running muscles do NOT equal lunging muscles).  I cannot give it higher praise - I go back and forth between level 2 and level 3 to keep it interesting (with runs every other day) and always feel like I might die at some point (which is a good thing).  A recent NY Times article questioned whether it was possible to get fit in 6 minutes a week (I will suggest that it is NOT possible for me) but in order to make this happen (ex. crossfit) you need to feel like you might die.  For me -- she gets me there!! Huge fan of Jillian and this video!!!

B001FB4W16|5.0|Having read many, many vampire books and seen all the movies and tv shows, I can definitely say that True Blood is the real deal.  Hands down, better than the twilight crap.  The visuals are amazing, the acting is great (even though some of the human characters aren't entirely believable), and each episode really pulls you in.  Definitely get the BluRay disks - the 1080p is stunning and the BluRay extras are worth it.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|The apocalyptic premise of this loose adaptation of the P.D. James novel The Children of Men holds that fertility has hit zero for nigh on two decades, and that as a result the world order is collapsing. Opening with the news that the youngest living person in the world has been murdered at the age of 18, it swiftly and skilfully establishes a dystopian vision of a near future Britain--a police state wherein society is just barely maintaining its fabric. Present day fears and tensions such as those surrounding terrorism and immigration are extrapolated to a terrifying endgame in a world without hope, and a quiet seaside town is transformed into a warzone. Stark and arresting in its imagery and with no holds barred representations of violence, some incredibly long and complicated continuous shot sequences add to a gritty documentary feel. Clive Owen's perfectly judged hero of the piece is a broken man who falls into the role of protector to what might be the last hope for the future of the human race, and as violence rages all around him, it's notable that he never once picks up a gun himself. From the central story through superb acting from a cast that includes some big names in fairly minor supporting roles, through to its powerful direction and cinematography, this film is a work of art that is quite literally stunning in every sense.<br /><br />--Adam Chamberlain<br />Revelation Magazine

6304806434|5.0|I it totally not plausable, and totally fun! Every corner Nicholas Cage turns in this movie, despite his crummy Southern accent, he hads to get to his baby daughters birthday,  He will do anything to get there and there and this band of pure consciousless devils will stop the process at every turn,  even once it ic grounded. I never cried at Titanic but a few tears slipped out at the ending scene. I don't want to spoil the end, but it was so much action and the end was so sweet. Buy the movie you won't be sorry you did !

B0000DJE9R|4.0|This is an exceptional collection because they're all hits from an exceptional entertainer. The only reason it gets 4 and not 5 stars is because about half of the tracks are the \\"Single Version\\" or \\"Radio Edit.\\" This means many instrumental intros and breaks have been shortened or taken out all together.<br /><br />The track listing for HIStory doesn't tell you whether a song is an edit or not. You'll just have to compare the lengths. If you already own Number Ones, you should get HIStory as well for the full-length tracks. If you have neither, go with HIStory.
B001N26GFM|1.0|My son read this book because it was on his summer reading list for school, and afterward we rented the movie. He told me the ending before we watched it. I explained to him that this would never happen. He knows the horrors of the death camps. But I felt it was my duty to remind him how far-fetched this particular story was.    The DVD extras were interesting. The book's writer said \\"this is not a Holocaust movie\\" but said it was about the friendship of two boys, etc...is he insane! The setting is the whole point! It just doesn't work.     Take the friendship angle and place it in any other setting, for example, boys from different social classes; or different races, etc and maybe it could work. But not here. This is simply holocaust revisionist writing.    The one star I gave was for the acting. I thought they all did a fine job, even though spoken with British accents....their performances were fine. I won't fault the actors for an inaccurate storyline and poor direction (keeping the Brit accents.)
B00004XONN|5.0|How on earth anyone could ever imagine that a band like Radiohead would come with an album like this? It's so creepy, dark... really dark and so careless about pleasing anyone or anything for that matter! Thom Yorke said right after the album was realesed that this one was \\"a commercial suicide\\" and man was he so right! The songs here are not radio friendly at all!!! \\"Everything in its the right place\\" starts the album with Thom Yorke singing \\"I woke up sucking a lemon\\" WTH?!?! not to mention the fact that the melody is so weird and beautiful at the same time. Then, \\"KID A\\" goes on and this is the one where you think \\"Radiohead has just lost its mind\\" This is such a difficult song to listen to that the media would just rather call it \\"pure garbage and noise\\" but, if you really pay attention, Yorke and Greenwood's real intentions here are to challenge us to understand how the whole wide world is going downhill. \\"The national anthem\\" might be the song that any fan can find \\"listenable\\" but then, as a terminal patient at the hospital just when you think everything is going ok then again, it gets an epilepsia's attack after the catchy bass line with all the trumphets and stuff. On the other hand, \\"How to dissapear completely\\" is one of the most beautiful Radiohead's songs to date... can't talk about it, you have to listen to it. Then, \\"Treefingers\\" seems to be an intermission for all the paranoia to come. \\"Optimistic-In limbo\\" are just two great abstract tunes that Radiohead attached here. and \\"Idioteque\\" becomes the uncomfortable factor to all the politicians all over the world. Here Radiohead goes electronic and they just hit the bull's eye with pinpoint accuracy. The two last tracks \\"Morning bell\\" and \\"Motion picture soundtrack\\" are just the greatest way to close the album.<br /><br />This album was the first sight to what it was about to come in the following years with an intelligent Radiohead saying to the music industry how tired they were of it. The album went to number 1 on billboard right after its realese and funnily enough Thom Yorke declares that Radiohead and charts don't get along. Awesome record that amazes anyone who thought they knew Radiohead.ber 1 on billboard right after its realese and funnily enough Thom Yorke declares that Radiohead and charts don´t get along.

B001TODCII|4.0|I have not been sucked into a movie like this in a long time.  I was actually sweating!  I've always thought critics usually get it right, but not this one.  See it for yourself; you won't be disappointed.  Liam Neeson is outstanding in this intense, but satisfying thriller about a father whose daughter is kidnapped while vacationing in Europe.  Unfortunately for the bad guys, Neeson makes Jason Bourne look like a pussy cat as he tries to get her back.  The action scenes are excellent, but violent.<br /><br />Some have criticized this movie for not pausing to question the morality of Neesom's rampage, but \\"Taken\\" has a very raw and straightfoward purpose - to connect the viewer emotionally to Neeson as he singelmindedly pursues his daughter.  I get the sense the filmmakers recognize that at some point, with all of us, family and paternal bonds trump moral dilemmas.<br /><br />A word of caution - If you have a daughter, your gut will be in knots the whole time.
B0013FNC38|5.0|This is one of those albums that you can listen to over and over. His voice? Amazing. It's uplifting without being cheesy. Great, great, great. So good in fact, that this is the first review I've ever felt compelled to write!
B0001K2K84|5.0|This album contains four super-bad players at their creative and technical primes.  If you are a fan of any of these guys' other works, you'll certainly love this.  (In case you don't know, it's John Scofield on guitar and Alphonso Johnson on bass.)<br /><br />It took one listen to come up with a five star rating for this album.  It grooves enough to rock the party and is sophisticated enough to sit down and analyze.  Like it suggests on the liner notes, what a shame that this is the only album these four did together!
0439023483|4.0|A friend of mine suggested this title to me, knowing I'd like it.  I have a great fondness for dystopian novels, whether they be science fiction, alternate history, or, as this one is, an imagined future.  And I do like it.  A lot.  As a member of this genre, it is an exemplar.<br /><br />In this novel, we have a future North America, where civilization as we know it has been wiped out in the distant past by some sort of cataclysm.  All that survives is the Capitol, where people live in safety and luxury, and 12 outlying districts, where people are treated harshly and serve the Capitol.  Once, the districts rebelled against the Capitol, but they were soundly defeated (and district 13 was destroyed).  In punishment, every year, each district has to send two teenagers, one boy and one girl, to the Capitol to compete in the Hunger Games, where these 24 kids fight to the death until only one is left standing.  Our protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is selected to represent district 12.<br /><br />Like many novels of this type, it has some problems to overcome.  First, it has to compete with stories that have come before.  Elements of 1984, The Giver, Lord of the Flies, and Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" leap off the page.  Additionally, given the style of storytelling, the point of view, and the forthcoming sequel, there is the fact that we essentially know how the story has to end.  It is not that our heroine is going to survive that is the issue, but how she is going to do it that matters.<br /><br />Fortunately, Ms. Collins does an excellent job of getting us from beginning to end.  She creates a fascinating world that we get to know only gradually with elements we recognize contrasted with excellent ideas of her own invention.  Her characters are strong.  Katniss, the main character, is wonderful--strong and clever but sometimes clueless and irritating--and she is surrounded by a strong supporting cast.  Her prose is tight and keeps things moving forward rapidly.  And, to her especial credit given the inevitability of the ending, she twists the knife a little bit with some surprises and leads nicely into her follow-up novel due later this year.<br /><br />Overall, I was very pleased with the book.  If I felt the book had been directed at me, I would probably have felt even better about it, despite its weaknesses.  But it is clearly meant to be a young adult novel.  Now, I believe that any good novel for young adults should be readable with equal pleasure by adults, and this novel certainly qualifies in that regard; however, I found myself disturbed by the fact that kids would be reading this.  Not that I think they shouldn't read it.  Once a kid reaches a certain level of maturity, I think the world of books should be wide open.  I was just saddened by the reality that such out and out brutality and sexuality that is found in this novel is considered normal fare for teenagers these days.  I read some pretty harsh things as a kid (and brutality comes in a lot of forms), but this felt different to me.  Maybe because the tough things I read were novels meant for \\"adults\\" and this book is not.<br /><br />Still, a good novel is a good novel and this is a good one.  I may hope my kids hold off reading it until they are well into their teenage years, but at least I'll be ready to talk to them about it if they ever decide to read it.given the inevitability of the ending, she twists the knife a little bit with some surprises and leads nicely into her follow-up novel due later this year.

B00006J9OT|5.0|Beautiful use of audience energy which is incorporated in a way that doesn't detract from the music.  It gives the feeling you're there.  Several of the tracks highlight at least one of her band's instruments which adds to the \\"show\\" quality.
1401200923|3.0|Okay the art in this book is fantastic but Hush isn't a good mystery its painfully obvious who Hush is and the thing is that we never heard of Bruce Wayne's childhood friend until this story and his motives are unclear. We hear that he wanted to kill his parents but we never get a reason why he hated his parents and wanted there money was he just born evil or something? The good news is that if you don't know anything about Batman or any of the supporting characters its a good book to pick up. This volume is also better then volume 1 in terms of length. I enjoyed hush but it wasn't anything mind blowing.
B0026J8LHM|4.0|Allow me to say that I have consumed this album before writing this review and I still do not know whether I should criticise or congratulate the guys. Though I would agree to some of the people criticising DT in many aspects, I think my general opinion about the album is positive.    Fitst of all I am grateful to DT for delivering at least one song that I shall record as \\"among all time best DT songs\\" which is \\"A nightmare to remember\\" to be specific. Many of the epics presented in the last albums sounded like 3-4 different songs embedded into each other, but this one in my point of view is up there like Metropolis. It is a real epic and most important of all \\"it sounds good\\". I call this piece a true masterpiece with especially incredible drumming from Portnoy. If you believe that you had seen it all from him and he plays the same stuff in the last albums, just check the blast beat by the end of the song. Clever, brilliant...    \\"A rite of passage\\" is another solid song which sounds very good to me. Very strong vocal lines, all DT members serve the song here. One of the best songs in the album. I also enjoyed the \\"Shattered Fortress\\" very much. In previous albums  we had already seen many attempts to make references to old songs, but this one has taken it to another level, and I have found it impressive this time.  I have found \\"Wither\\" and \\"The best of times\\" average...Maybe 6 or 7 out of ten. If \\"Count of Tuscany\\" were 8 minutes instead of 19 and a half, it would have been a solid song since it has a very strong main theme, bridge and chorus and some of the instrumental parts sound good. But a 19 and a half minute version just did not work for me. It did not sound \\"natural\\"    Since I have liked half of the songs very much, I would like to give four stars to this album. But being a fan since 1988,allow me to kindly make three recommendations for DT. Firstly, please do something about the lyrics. \\"I don't want to die, suddenly I am frightened for my life?????\\". Come on guys... Secondly, please do not make another album for some time. Don't even think about releasing another concert DVD. Take a long break. Look into your music at a wider perspective and come back fresh. Thirdly, concentrate on writing songs that sounds good. Forget about giving virtuosity the highest priority (even the deaf would easily understand that you can really play well), forget about intentionally writing long songs, forget about musical formulas. If that requires changing your record company, please do so.

1401200605|3.0|The dialogue and art are great and Hush is a interesting story but this book is paper thin. When I sat down with this book I honestly couldn't believe how thin it was. DC could have easily have made Hush One Volume but they cheat you out of your money by spilling it into two parts. There's Absolute Hush which is $40 which should contain the full story and added bonuses but to be honest I haven't picked it up and I don't know if its worth the money so there's no real way to get around it. There's a really good Batman vs. Superman fight in this book and despite it being paper thin its not a bad book.
0061191981|4.0|Anyone who knows Ramsay only from Hell's Kitchen commercials will be very surprised at the person that is found in this text.  Rather than being a simple (and rather crude) person, Ramsay's lived quite a life and given up a lot for the simple goal of becoming very good at cookery.  His book gives a great deal of background of the making of the person of today, from his loves to his family issues.  You never get the impression that he's hiding anything, and his stories are well-chosen and often highlight his flaws rather than his successes.<br /><br />Overall, Ramsay's book is a quick, entertaining read that humanizes the televised caricature into a warm and immensely talented person.  Highly recommended.
031606792X|1.0|After reading \\"Twilight\\", I could not wait for the rest of the books; it had been one of the best books I had read in a long time.  The second book (New Moon) was okay, \\"Eclipse\\" came next and I felt the books were starting to get annoying, but since I had read the first three, I had to read the last one, \\"Breaking Dawn\\" and it was NOT easy; I thought it was one of the worst books I had ever read and I just wanted it to end.  Bella becoming the love of a vampire as it started in \\"Twilight\\" was both different and exciting, but then moving on to this last book where she has this odd half-vampire baby and Jacob imprints some werewolf into the baby also, was just way too over-the-top.   Add in the odd vampire battle that ensues with the Voltari, and it just got to the point of ridiculous, especially the corny attempts at humor in some places and Bella's ridiculous command of situations (when before she was a klutz who did nothing right); now in this book she comes off in parts as being more intelligent than any of the vampires and werewolves with her defiance.  NOT recommended; VERY disappointing.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|I went to see Disney's Pixar's UP in the Theater on Wednesday. This is one excellent film. It really has it all. It's fun, it's sentimental, it's funny, it's heart touching and it's entertaining for the entire family.       Without giving to much information about the plot it's centers around an old gentlemen who had a dream about exploring a place in South America called Paradise Falls. But It seemed whenever he and his wife would be getting closer to this goal something would happen and the funds saved for that dream would end up going to some other unexpected expense.      The journey to reach this goal and the adventure along the way make for a compelling and wonderful movie. This is a film not to be missed. I am looking forward to the DVD release to enjoy this film again.

For all of fans that stayed true to Michael in spite of the unkind publicity, if you haven't seen this concert   you have really missed out. I cannot praise it enough.     You were a musical genius and will be missed by all your beloved fans  LONG LIVE THE KING OF POP
B000JJRIO8|4.0|I wish this album would have been longer.  This album has songs on it I like better than some when Pac was alive.  All eyes on me is still the best album in my opinion but Pac's Life is worth getting, unlike some of that other garbage released in his name after he passed.  Like I said though, way too short... I think it only has 8 or so tracks.

0156030306|5.0|I just finished reading this book today and all I can say is that this story will truly stay with you. The story is about Charlie Gordon who is moderately retarded and his wish to one day be \\"smart\\". The narrative is told through a series of progress reports that Charlie is instructed to write by a group of scientists who are considering using Charlie as the first human subject of an expiremental surgery / procedure that has been shown to increase cognition and intelligence in animals and has been particularly effective and possibly permanent in a mouse named Algernon. Once Charlie is selected and operated on we begin to see his awareness and intelligence increase at an astounding rate. The author easily conveys Charlie's increased intelligence and perception by having Charlie's progress reports become noticeably more grammatical and with improved spelling and puncuation. But, what becomes interesting is that with the increased intelligence Charlie's life does not necessarily become easier. If anything Charlie tackles Herculean psychological and physical obstacles that would ruin a normal man and yet he endures.    That's really all I think the reader should know about this book before reading. However I did want to say that Daniel Keyes has done an exceptional job writing the character Charlie Gordon. Charlie is psychologically two different people in this book and Daniel handles this absolutely perfectly. Charlie even begins to talk about the pre-operation Charlie as almost a totally separate person altogether! The struggle that ensues between the two Charlie's in multiple segments of this book is fascinating and disturbing at the same time.     I highly recommend this book and am sure that I will read it again.

B00005AQGJ|2.0|Personally, the best two tracks are 9 and 11 overall, if I had to like any of them.  Unlike the other folks that rated this item, I thought the beats were sad on this album.  I'm glad this album was Makaveli rather than Tupac because it just didn't do Pac justice to release this album under his name.  I know there's a lot of folks out there that disagree with me on this but I've filed this CD away and chalked it up as something I won't put in my player ever again.

B000002HMH|5.0|I'd like to first apologize to Metallica for giving this album so much flack upon initial release.  Being a hardcore Metallica fan something about the new logo, the short hair, and Until it Sleeps that really struck a negative chord with me.  I wanted another Kill 'em All, and was initially disappointed.    Sitting here today, a decade older I can't say how much I love this album.  70% of these songs are absolutely fantastic, and though it was a different Metallica sound it was a unique & creative sound that stacks up there with some of their greatest material.    The House that Jack Built, Bleeding Me, Ronnie, Outlaw Torn, & others are so enjoyable that its hard to imagine why we were all so negative back in the 90s.  I'd love to see another album with the same song quality, sorry Re-Load sucked.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of all things vampire, so naturally I knew I had to see this series when it came out on DVD. I was so blown away that I watched the whole thing in 2 days!     So you know I loved the show, but one of the main reasons I wanted to write a review is to mass comment to all the people who were turned off by the sex, nudity, and violence.    First of all, It's an HBO show. People, when something is on HBO, you should know that it will be graphic. You have to subscribe to the channel for a reason. Second, we're all adults here. Why is everyone so ashamed of sex? It's the most natural act in the world, and it's the reason you and I are here right now. Third, IT'S A VAMPIRE SERIES PEOPLE! Vampires kill people. Killing people is violent. Of course there will be violence in the show! If you really expected to watch a show centered around creatures that DRINK BLOOD to live and not have it be violent, you shouldn't be allowed to write a review about the show.

B00127RAJY|5.0|If you're looking to get into shape or if you need a quick and effective workout for home, this is your dvd. I love this DVD. Jillian doesn't hold back and kicks your butt for the entire 20 mins but you'll feel and see the effects almost right away. I'm looking to lose maybe 5-8 lbs but really more interested in overall toning and this has given me the jump start I need. Once I'm done w/the 30 days (currently on day 25), I'll try her other DVDs but will do this workout when I only have 20 mins. It is a little hard on the knees so just be careful and watch your form. I had to take 2 days off when my knee started bothering me once I started level 2. I've been more aware of my knee during the workout so haven't had any problems since the break. Don't be discouraged if you need to modify the moves. You really will get stronger as the weeks progress. Love it!

B001KVZ6F2|4.0|I have enjoyed most all of Clint Eastwood's movies whether he's the actor, director, or writer.  He is, with Woody Allen, one of the two best contemporary American directors.  He is also the John Wayne of our times.  Eastwood gets credit for exploring the soul (and the society the poor soul lives in) in a manner that leaves us with a lot to think about.  In \\"Gran Torino\\" Eastwood tackles the issue of prejudice by showing how a man beyond repair can still come to see the light.     The opening of the film tells us all in a few short scenes; elderly widower, unhappy with the world, uncommunicative with his well-meaning sons and their families, staying in a community that \\"changed\\" into one where he is alone in isolation.  A man whose major life-changing event was the Korean War where he killed Asian enemies who, in turn, had killed his American buddies, he looks out around his Detroit neighborhood and finds himself surrounded by Asians who are, in this case, Hmong refugees.  Either way they are just Asians to him.  Now, all alone after the death of his wife, what is there for him other than his mint condition Gran Torino.      Obviously this movie creates a series of events that gets Eastwood off his front porch and involves him with his neighbors.  (Otherwise this would be a pretty boring film).  The manner in which things happen are presented in a believable manner.  The metamorphisis we see happening before us may seen a bit sudden at times but we'll just let that pass as the handiwork of the local (and youthful) priest.  Cultures and generations are heading for a collision and the results leave us with a bittersweet taste.  Heroism takes many forms and we get to observe one form not often portrayed these days.  Given the clerical involvement it may be fair to suggest a few Biblical parallels but I'll let you decide for yourself.      I missed seeing this movie on the big screen.  It was in town just a short while and I heard mixed reviews about it.  I can see where some might not care for the ending and I have struggled with a 4 star or a 5 star rating.  I decided on 4 stars by rating \\"Gran Torino\\" against other recent Eastwood pictures.  It's not a \\"family picture\\" but it is certainly worth seeing.

1400032717|5.0|This book was great!  It's a quick and easy read.  There are cute little diagrams and pictures sprinkled through the book, as the main character, Christopher, explains some of the things he is talking about.  I have never read a book written like this.  It really gives you an inside look into the mind of a child who has autism.  Have you ever wondered why a boy might listen to the white noise between radio stations?  Or why he finds repetitive actions so darn comforting?  Or why he doesn't like to be touched?  This book made me laugh and understand a lot more of what it must be like to be a special needs child.  As Christopher tries to detect who killed his neighbor's dog, the story unfolds to reveal a delightful adventure he has, heartbreaking moments he suffers through, and scary social situations he must somehow make it through.  I give this book FIVE STARS!  It was great.  I wish the author would write many more books like this.  It is definitely one of my all time favorites, and one I will easily remember, simply for the interesting perspective it was written in.  Seeing life through Christopher's eyes has made me understand life a little bit better!
6304493681|5.0|Believe it or not, there is still a large portion of the general public that believes that animation is a genre of entertainment that is for children.  One shot of this classic cyberpunk anime would kill that notion dead.  \\"Ghost in the Shell\\" is to anime what [[ASIN:B0002Y69NG The Matrix]] is to Hollywood: a modern classic science fiction masterpiece that defines the genre and even transcends it with a spectacular relevance to both the present and future of humanity's technological advances.  GITS can easily stand alongside the the best works of the genre and is absolutely required viewing for fans of sci-fi.  Combining the classic themes of artificial intelligence run wild, synthetic humanity, and cyberspace and adding in touches of noir, espionage, action, fantastic visual effects, and a unique overall sensibility GITS delivers in every sense.<br /><br />The tale begins with the top secret Section 9's star agent, a cyborg nicknamed The Major, carrying out one of the coolest assassinations in film history to prevent the possible defection/abduction of a technician with some very sensitive information.  In addition, a criminal hacker known as The Puppet Master has began hacking the cyberbrains of humans with cybernetic implants and using them for dubious purposes.  As the plot thickens we find that espionage is only the beginning and that indeed we may be looking at the final step in the evolution of human and machine alike.  But before the heavy existential philosophy fully kicks in there are some seriously killer action sequences to enjoy.  GITS is heavy on nudity and has a few shots of seriously brutal gore to sate your bloodlust (or regular lust, you pervert), but neither are a good reason to see this film.  A story that makes you seriously question the value of your own humanity and existence is a success any way you look at it and that's what this anime offers in part. A side-by-side comparison of the data that defines each and every one of our identities with the data that could make up a virtual entity yields few meaningful differences, especially in a future where humans routinely replace their bodies and even their brains with artificial ones.  And should the data that makes up a virtual existence find a way to integrate itself into another similar being and create a third being mixing traits of both parent entities, is that any different from our physical reproduction and evolution?  Indeed, what is to there to stop us as beings comprised entirely of information from simply ceasing physical existence altogether and taking to the limitless depths of the net itself?  This is what great science fiction is made of.<br /><br />As human and computer become more and more compatible with one another it will be extremely interesting to see what the future holds.  GITS has spawned a Blade Runner-esque [[ASIN:B001K98MFK direct sequel]], a much lighter-themed [[ASIN:B000HIVQAS television series]], and another [[ASIN:B000PWQPAC movie]] based on the television series.  All are good, but none has captured the sheer originality and brilliance of the original.  The relevance of this work will never be diminished and the subtle but poignant political and social commentary is there if you want it.  Read between the lines of the opening text's explication that in spite of the advances in technology and communication racial and national distinctions remain for a little personal philosophy suggesting that such meaningless distinctions may have overstayed their usefulness.  And being as that is the case, perhaps  the answers to humanity's problems lie in leaving physical and geographical differences behind altogether and creating an existence for humanity that is a bit more more....infinite.  Food for thought.data that could make up a virtual entity yields few meaningful differences, especially in a future where humans routinely replace their bodies and even their brains with artificial ones.

0786939532|3.0|I was looking for a good book to read and this series kept on nudging me to try it. It's everywhere, all over amazon with its seemingly endless different packaging and editions and they usually take up a few rows in the fantasy section of bookstores. So I decided to try it out.     It was a good read, it was short and well written, but it seemed to be wandering around without much of a solid plot. That can be expected though since its a prequel and its purpose is to introduce the drow race and the main character, Drizzt, so I didn't look too far into it. The only thing that was pretty off was the way in which he was raised. He spent around 8 years of his childhood locked inside a room with his older sister that was 'teaching' him his standing in drow society (males are looked down upon by women). I thought that this was a huge flaw. I have read many books where there is a race, class, or gender that was spat on by people of higher standings, but I have never read of a slave or a servant go through 8 years orientation to fit that role. It's expected that they learn through experience, not 8 years of brainwashing. Nevertheless, it all proved useless against the boy wonder who blatantly disrespected his mother the first day he gets out. Aside from this, I wish the author would have explained a bit more of how the city functions. The role the noble houses play in the government, how the regular drow citizens live, and where the real power lies in the government. I feel as if he only scratches the surface of all this.     Other than that, the book has its high points. I enjoyed the moments of self discovery that Drizzt experienced throughout the book, in which he seems to be understanding the drow race. The parts with the panther are quite good as well, even though there is a 'Love conquers all' sequence that I think the author should have avoided and had gone with a more realistic solution to the dilemma.     Overall this is a pretty good read, a simple and crisp book for anyone that wants to indulge themselves on a little fantasy.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|What makes a great comic book story?  Cool gadgets, great fight scenes, a snazzy disguise, unassuming sidekicks, an unfathomable villian, an incorruptible hero and everyone else caught in between.    What makes a great movie?  Great, realistic dialogue.  Unpredictable drama.  The occasional comedy that is not contrived, and not felt like it was purposely written into the script for laughs.  A doomed romance.  An ensemble cast of multiple protagonists and antagonists.  And a haunting soundtrack.     Given these two descriptions, one can safely say that \\"The Dark Knight\\" is probably the greatest comic book movie of all time, and one of the greatest movies of all time.  Unlike \\"Batman Begins\\", there is no exotic locales.  No supernatural powers or allusions to myth like in the Superman, X-Men, Spiderman or other comic book genres transplanted to the big and small screens.  No, what Christopher Nolan created here is a perfect mix of Hill Street Blues, Law & Order, Heat, and the Godfather trilogy into a 2.5 hour movie set in a major metropolis that feels and looks like Chicago in the summertime.      Of all the movies dealing with crime, the police, psychopaths, and heroes; none so perfectly blends intimate human emotions with the subtle and overt features of office politics, city politics, and mass propaganda.  The scenes between DA Harvey Dent and James Gordon epitomize bureaucratic turf protection like few other films.  The contest between Batman and the Joker represents the ultimate chess match; except played out over an entire city.  And the on-screen wiles of James Gordon, Lucius Fox, and numerous other characters reveal that superheroes did not get to where they are thru sheer personal talent; but instead rely on well-honed teams of dedicated individuals.  Probably the most insightful feature of this film is the subtle but unceasing display of ownership.  Almost every single major location of this film is owned by some individual or institution; often to the ignorance and surprise of the general public.  Whether it is the opening scene in the mob-owned bank, to the dinner scene in the restaurant owned by Bruce Wayne, this unseen ownership of place and time by unseen actors in higher (or lower) positions is the ultimate feature of modern society; one that makes organized crime feasible and profitable.  And it is this feature that is the icing on the cake that is this great movie.  So overall, this is Hollywood perfection and a must watch film.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I stumbled upon this show midway through the first season and have been hooked ever since. Johnny Geliecki and Jim Parsons star as physicist nerds Leonard and Sheldon whose pristine world of knowledge and logic is shaken to it's core when a attractive blond named Penny (Kaley Cuoco) moves in across the hall from them. Leonard is immidetly attracted to Penny and immediately seeks to make friends with her, but is often derailed by his own discomfort with women and his genius friend Sheldon, who has no concept of sarcasm and believes that every problem can be solved intellectually, thus Penny and Sheldon have problems getting along...e.g. in one of the early episodes Sheldon is so consumed with Penny's mess that he enters her apartment as she sleeps and cleans it! As time goes by however, she begins to see the boys for their good intentions instead as creepy stalkers.    Simon Helberg and Kunal Nayyar star as Howard and Rahj, Leonard and Sheldon's other geeky, genius friends. Howard is a want to be ladies man, who lives with his screaming mother and wants sex at any cost. However, his actions come across as creepy and little perverted to Penny and other women, so he openly brags about paying for prostitutes and working on the engineering questions of the universe. Rahj meanwhile is so uncomfortable in front of Penny that he can only talk to her or any other women with the aid of alcohol.

0553213105|2.0|Nice For Some Maybe Even Most, But Sadly Not My Cup of Tea<br /><br />To those of you who adore Jane Austen please try not to take it personally that I did not love this book, it is not an insult to you OR her.<br /><br />I have traditionally avoided the classics but made a recent resolution to try some.  I made a list of a dozen or so and have had mixed results so far.<br /><br />I think that my expectations were too high, I was expecting something like Jane Eyre, which I loved.  Unfortunately I found 'Pride and Prejudice' a little too frivolous for my tastes.<br /><br />Perhaps if I had known what I was getting before I started I would have been less disappointed?  It felt like a fluffy romance novel, which I do not in general care for.  I love a good love story, part of why I loved Jane Eyre.<br /><br />Maybe if it had been called 'Pretty Girls Out Husband Hunting' or 'Lydia Lands In a Jam' or something equally silly I would have known what I was in for.<br /><br />Maybe this wasn't the best first Jane Austen novel to read?<br />I'm not sure if I will be reading another.<br /><br />Okay, I know that 655 of you loved this and many of you will have to give me a negative vote because we don't agree...So, let the negative votes begin *winces*.

B000069HZP|4.0|Here is my take on an older movie that already has over 200 reviews - I have seen it twice because it is worthy of that acknowledgment:    Nicholas Van Orton lives a cold, sterile life, haunted by the suicide of his father which has indelibly marked him as a child who witnessed it - he can't get it out of his mind.    His birthday is coming up, another one of them he doesn't see any use for.  Everyone wishes him well, from a distance, because that is what is required of anyone who knows him.  His estranged little brother, Conrad, the exact opposite of himself in personality, but who also had personal issues he had to deal with, calls him, posing as an old friend, Seymore Butts - because he obviously thinks that's the only way the invitation will be accepted since his social standing has suffered in comparison with his successful, distant older brother - requesting his presence at dinner.  This does draw a sort of smile from the cast iron face of Nicholas, and he sets it up through his secretary.  A painful dinner conversation ensues, and the roguish little brother presents Nicholas with a gift - a gift certificate to play a reality game, although nothing is known or revealed about it.  He thinks it's a bunch of hooey, but it's paid for, so he decides what the heck.    Things happen rapidly from there on and it is best to not reveal the plot, mainly because it's impossible.  But there is a message if one wants to look for it through the fray.    My Summary:  It was an action flick with an embedded message:   Life is what you make it and you need to live it while it is in front of you rather than using crutches or casting blame for things you cannot control.  That may be easier said than done but the concept is a truth.  You don't need drugs, alcohol or psychiatrists because real life is a trip of it's own if you have the nerve to go for it - no excuses, and the devil take the hindmost.  But you DO need to live it and enjoy it;  you DO need love and your own people around you or the whole thing is for nothing.  And sometimes that should be worthy of a self-analysis before it's too late.

0060558121|5.0|Neil Gaiman has been named as one of the top ten living post-modern writers (the Dictionary of Literary Biography). A prolific creator of comics, drama, poetry, prose and song lyrics, he's also been called the new face of horror fiction. You can even find him active in other media such as blogging, film, journalism, radio and television.<br /><br />His New York Times best-selling novel, American Gods, was awarded the Bram Stoker, Locus, Hugo, Nebula and SFX awards.<br /><br />Anansi Boys, closely related to American Gods, has elements of comedy, horror, romance, the supernatural and even humour.<br /><br />His collection of short fiction, Smoke and Mirrors, dark and unique, has been compared to the works of H. P. Lovecraft, Harlan Ellison, Ray Bradbury and Stephen King (who is, himself, a fan of the author).<br /><br />Better known for his classic work, The Sandman, a collection of modern, adult comics, Gaiman is a forty-something Englishman who now lives in the U.S.<br /><br />I've read all three of the books mentioned. My 17 year-old son, a fan of The Sandman, bought them and insisted I devote some time to them. He figured if I was a fan of Stephen King, a horror writer who is arguably the finest story teller around, I just had to love Gaiman. He was right.<br /><br />I can't think of anyone who has created a mythology quite like Gaiman's. His haunting vision of the landscape of modern Gods makes my skin crawl, yet I find myself unable to leave his work alone. His writing is like a drug that hooks you and leaves you an addict who must have more.<br /><br />If you're new to the horror genre, I'd recommend adding this author to your reading list. More literary than Stephen King and possibly more difficult to read, Neil Gaiman will reward you for your effort.<br /><br />Clayton Bye<br />[...]<br />Copyright © 2009 by Clayton Bye

1439102813|4.0|\\"Still Alice\\" movingly portrays the story of a highly educated woman's descent into the dementia caused by early onset Alzheimer disease and its impact on her family.  Having been around persons with dementia, be it Alzheimer's or other, the story touched me with its realism, particularly with regard to the impact on family members and others around the patient.  In addition, I found myself wondering what I would do if I learned that I had the disease.  Alice's attempt to steer her future haunted me.    My only criticism of the book it that it appeared during certain portions that the author was trying to \\"novelize\\" an \\"all about Alzheimer's\\" book for lay people.  The meetings with the doctors, and even conversations between the characters, seemed stilted at times.  The author clearly wants to educate readers about different treatment options, the nature of clinical trials, and the range of responses by family, friends and colleagues to the diagnosis.  However, sometimes I couldn't tell if it was meant to be a novel or a \\"what to expect\\" or \\"how to\\" book.    Nevertheless, it is a well-written, moving book which, based on my experience, accurately portrays the heartbreak of dementia in a person we care about and for.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|As always, I like Pink Floyd, and know their number one album was Dark Side of the Moon. This final scheduled concert, which was without two members of the original Pink Floyd, demonstrates they did not lose anything in their concert with the absence of those two people. It was awesome, and will remain in my collection forever. I highly recomend to anyone who likes Pink Floyd or who has not heard or seen them, to purchase this DVD and enjoy the real live action and showmanship they exhibit. They will never duplicate this, since two of them are now gone forever.

Rambo is the metaphor for the all American boy's dream to be tough, independent, trustworthy, reliable, intelligent, and patriotic. Rambo deals with personal ghosts and looks for salvation but all the while he keeps his whits and always finds a way to win. If you watch the trilogy, don't forget the last movie to round out the collection.

For one to exist, so must the other. It's high time for the atheists to get over themselves and ponder a simple logical question: How can a creation exist wihout a creator? Did the Mona Lisa paint itself? Pretty neat trick! I dislike rabid fundamentalism in ANY religion but I 'spect the Great Architect of the Universe has matters of free choice well in hand. It's my choice to believe and Mr. Dawkins' choice not to. Hey God! Thanks for creating us to be able to make that choice!

0307341569|4.0|Libby Day's family was killed 24 years earlier (when she was 7) by her lone-surviving brother who is in prison for life. Libby drifts through a pretty meaningless existence in a decrepit Midwest town.  Running out of money, she meets up with a fan club willing to pay her to look into the murder and prove her brother innocent.  Gillian Flynn's first book, Sharp Objects, is one of my all-time favorite books. I've read it three times and it never gets old. I was excited to pick up her sophomore effort, Dark Places, which uses the same formula of an unsolved murder and a 30-something dark and self-tortured female heroine. Libby Day however is much less sympathetic than Camille Preaker (the heroine in Sharp Objects) so the book falls a little short for me.  The plotting though is just as sharp, the murder mystery just as suspenseful and well-developed.  The pacing is perfect, the ending 100% satisfying.  Flynn is an amazing writer. Her ability to put you there in the middle of a life, a scene, a town, is truly incredible.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games is set in a nation rebuilt after disaster; for a long time the people of Panem struggled against hunger as they worked to regain their lives. The Twelve Districts of Panem eventually overcome their difficulties with the help of the government, but a price must be exacted in order for no one to forget how and why survival occurred: Once a year, every year, a boy and a girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen are chosen from each District to participate in The Hunger Games, where only one will survive.<br /><br />Katniss has spent much of her life protecting her family after the death of her father, becoming an expert with a bow and arrow in order to bring in food and money for her mother and younger sister Prim. In the last year she's eligible for the Games, the unthinkable occurs: Prim's name is called. Katniss immediately volunteers in place of her sister and is sent away to the Capitol, along with the boy who has been chosen, in order to prepare for the ultimate killing game. Katniss and Peeta are from District Twelve, a District that's known only one winner in the last several years, and it's under his tutelage that the two must train. When Haymin, the mentor, discovers Peeta's crush on the harsh Katniss, he decides that will be their angle: star-crossed lovers having to compete against twenty two other \\"tributes\\" and finally, against one another. The Games are brutal, controlled by Gamemakers intent on ramping up the violence and misery in order to force the tributes to kill or be killed. Will Katniss and Peeta be able to survive until the end...and if they do, will either be able to kill the other in order to be declared the winner?<br /><br />The Hunger Games is told in first person present tense by Katniss as she experiences her selection for the Games, her complete makeover in order to win sympathy from the national audience watching her every move, and her fight to stay alive and protect those she loves. At first I felt things were moving too slowly as we went through all the steps leading up to the Games, but as Katniss appears in the arena, I realized that all of the build-up was necessary in order for the audience to understand the transformation Katniss must experience. The utter brutality she faces as she attempts to simply stay alive is compelling reading; Katniss must decide what she's willing to do in order to survive. The idea that all of this is somehow \\"entertainment\\" for a nation is both disturbing and yet plausible, and the cold, calculated moves on the parts of the tributes are bone chilling. I wanted her to win desperately, but somehow find a way to outsmart the cruelness of the Games and I found myself feverishly turning pages in order to find out what was going to happen next.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a glimpse into what we could become if we allow our baser instincts to take over, and it is peopled with children who are too easily lost in order to satisfy the sadistic whims of government and nation. Hopeful and bereft, you're going to be waiting on your doorstep for the next installment in this planned trilogy. I'll be right there with you.s we went through all the steps leading up to the Games, but as Katniss appears in the arena, I realized that all of the build-up was necessary in order for the audience to understand the transformation Katniss must experience.

1601251556|5.0|The mat is great for roleplaying. It saves on having to buy seperate tiles that will hopefully fit the part of the dungeon. With this, you can make your own sized rooms and everything else, even the items in the room, if you're a good enough artist (I'm not). Overall, while it is easily folding for transport, it is a little hard to keep infolded without the use of weights somewhere on the board, but it is well worth the buy.
B00006JKOL|2.0|GREAT JOB ON THE REMASTERING.  If you love this album, I would recommed buying this remastered version, even if already have a copy of an older version of the CD.  You may even want to get this if you have the LP.<br /><br />I know I am going to get a bunch of people angry, but I am not a big fan of the Minstrel in the Woods/Songs from the Gallery era.<br /><br />I think that most of the songs on Minstrel in the Gallery sound forced.  Like Ian Anderson has gone to the concept album concept one too many times.<br /><br />What I really don't like on this album is that it sounds like the lyrics don't work with the music.  Anderson is also stretching out words \\"Minstel in the Gal al al ler ree ee ee ee\\" or \\"White Du uh uh uh uh ck on the Wa ah ah ahl ahl\\" to get lyrics to work with the music.<br /><br />While I applaud experimentation and mixing of styles, I don't think his melding of English folk and rock is done very well.  The group has played in different styles before very successfully, but here it is all choppy and not blended well.<br /><br />The long songs on this album are too short.  Anderson is trying to jam too much into too short of a space.  So there are no easy transitions between styles. The musical interludes are too choppy.  Both Minstrel in the Gallery and Baker St. Muse would be greatly enhanced if they were increased by about 50%.  It is a balance not to be too short or too long.  Passion Play was probably a bit too long, but Thick As A Brick was just right (and the concert where it they stretched it out to one hour and 20 minutes was one of the best I ever saw).<br /><br />The good songs on this album are Cold Wind to Valhalla and 0=Nothing At All (too bad it has the awful One White Duch tacked on to the beginning).<br /><br />The remastering on the CD is fantastic.  The sound quality is excellent and as good as I have heard on almost any CD (except those in HDCD).  If you really like this album, and have an old version of the CD, I would still strongly recommend getting this remastered version.<br /><br />The bonus tracks do not make this worth getting.  The best ones were already on the 20th anniversary boxset (although that boxset is out of print and the sound quality is not as good).  The live tracks are just bits and pieces of the songs and not worth having.  I think they actuall detract from the CD.<br /><br />To calibrate:  I am a big Jethro Tull fan and own almost every album.  I saw them on during the Thick as a Brick tour, and still think of that as one of the best concerts I have ever seen.  I have a tapes from various concert tours up through the Passion Play tour and I think all of them are fantastic.  I have seen the group a number of times since then and have enjoyed every show.  However, I did not see the group during the dreaded 1980's.  I do have a concert tape from 1984 where the performance is pretty poor (Anderson's voice was going out and he cancelled the remainder of the tour).e bonus tracks do not make this worth getting.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Bought it as a gift because I was soo impressed with the story. Don't know the quality of the merchandize but as long as the video quality is good (no scratches, etc.) you can't go wrong with this video.
B000002GQL|5.0|For some reason this was (ironically) the last of the classic 7 Moody Blues album's to really grow on me.I don't know what it was on first listen that just kind of made me toss it off as their weakest effort.Only recently did I give it another chance.What a Killer album!Perhaps because the recording was diffirent than any other before it. Maybe because I just stereotyped it as the final album that the band had to release to fulfill a recording contract type of deal.I don't know,but even though my opinion may change in a month or two right now this is my favorite,maybe second favorite Moodie's album ever.I'll be the first to tell you that I've thought that at one time or another about each and every one of their albums(at least the first seven).But the magic on this album has a matured fulfilled feeling about it that is really quite impressive.The vocals and instrumentation are very strong on each and every song.My personal favorite's are \\"New Horizons\\",\\"For my Lady\\", and \\"Isn't life Strange\\" which are of course back to back on the album which makes it almost impossible for me to listen to one of these song's without the other two.\\"I'm just a singer\\" is a perfect way to not only end the album,but to also end the so called classic era of The Moody Blues career.It's only fitting that this would be last of their first seven albums to click with me and to anyone else my age(born in 86)I would recommend getting into their album's in order of their creation starting of course with \\"Day's of Future Passed\\".There is definitely something special and unique about the \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" of the Moody Blues.
031237593X|5.0|Wow what a book...I have tried to write my review several times and each time I find my words can not adequately describe what a great book this is and the extent to which I enjoyed it.    So I can only say go find this book and read it - you will definitely not be sorry.
B00005JKHP|5.0|There is nothing like the original cast from the original series to create an original movie that is so enjoyable.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|Prog Rock group The Mars Volta return with a more acoustic sound on this, their 5th studio album. If you liked \\"The widow\\" (from \\"Frances the mute\\") as I did, then you'll absolutely love \\"Octahedron\\". Loads of delicately plucked/strummed acoustic guitars and soothing harmonies. That's not to say they've totally lost all their loopiness, as the spacey effects and lengthy intros and codas (like the almost 2 minute intro to opening cut, the delicately affecting \\"Since we've been wrong\\") are still there.<br /><br />At eight songs, totaling 50 minutes, every song stands out really. With more regular song structures, the songs are catchy, but still with a dark underlining and lyrics as arcane as ever. Expect none of those crazy signature changes, or explosive funky/jazzy/dirty guitars and drums. Ok, they do rock out on \\"Cotopaxi\\" (with snarling guitars and vocals), and somewhat on the stunning \\"Desperate graves\\" (with a choppy chorus), but the rest of the album comprises beautiful acoustic ballads; think Grizzly Bear or Fleet Foxes meet Radiohead and you begin to get the picture. The lovely \\"Copernicus\\" (awesome delicate harmonies) is underpinned by subtle skittery electronic beats halfway through, while closing cut \\"Luciforms\\" has warbly sounding vocals.<br /><br />A change in musical direction, maybe, but still as edgy and experimental as ever. Their most accessible and beautiful effort yet!
B001C08RHA|4.0|Ironman is one of Marvel Comics characters that has been around at least in comic form since the early 1960's.  Something attested to by the fact that I had one conversation about this movie while attending a function at a church related retirement community.  When I heard that this movie was being made, I wondered how the film's producers would take a character who was a munitions maker and a superhero and put him on the big screen.  What if public opinion about the current wars became overwhelmingly negative before the movie's release?  In the comics the line was tread by having Tony Stark become an alchoholic during the heavy military expeditures of the 1980's but this was to be a two hour movie. For this movie, Ironman's origin was altered.  This time Tony Stark is injured by one of his own weapons, an idea borrowed from the comicbook origin of the Incredible Hulk.  The metal suit he develops is intended to be a less lethal method of stopping violent terrorists.  After returning to America he shifts Stark Industries away from the production of weapons.  The antagonist is now a war profiteer in his own company. There is just the right amount of comic relief and although some modifications have been made to the Ironman mythos, the story remains true to the spirit of Marvel Comics.    Since this movie is deservedly rated PG-13, a version for younger audiences would nice for parents.
B001TOVZYQ|5.0|This is an excellent movie. Wing Chun practitioners will love it. Unlike the other versions, the subtitles are well done. The bonus material is good, too.
B001DHXT20|4.0|Finally, this is the Incredible Hulk as he was seen in the comic books since the early 1960's.  I had forgotten how much fun the Hulk could be.  The Hulk is one of Marvel's creations that are equal parts superhero, horror, and sci-fi fantasy.  This character's story borrows as much from Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and King Kong as it does from earlier superheroes.  The battle between the Hulk and the Abomination is reminescent of \\"War of the Gargantuas\\".  Loaded with escapist action and adventure \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" also reminds us that humankind is responsible for the wonders and the horrors that we have wrought.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This is a neat album with musicians from all over the world.  Some familiar tunes and some other world music.  Definitely recommended to all music lovers.

B00005NI5Y|4.0|The first couple of times I played this record I wasn't very impressed and thought that it had little to offer. The music was good but I didn't like his voice and I couldn't believe that Dylan would open the album with a song called 'Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum'.     After repeated listens I still was having trouble identifying the greatness of this album so I set it aside. Then I purchased Together Through Life, which I enjoyed, and it made me take another listen to L&T and I finally got it! He was trying to summon old blues styles from the 40s and 50s...and was doing it masterfully!    As for the tracks, I still don't like Tweedle Dee. So if you were to take it off of the album you would start with Mississippi, which is a great song! I think it belongs on Time Out Of Mind (the album for which it was written) but it plays nicely here. Summer Days and Bye & Bye are good songs but I think the album really kicks in right after.    Lonesome Day Blues, Honest With Me and Cry A While are blistering blues jams, which Dylan's hard and raspy voice fits perfectly with the old school blues rhythms. High Water is unique and is sung with attitude. With the addition of the banjo, the subtle accordion and backing vocals this song really stands out. Floater, Moonlight and Po' Boy are graceful ballads which Dylan sings with a playfully slyness. Sugar Baby is a nice slower ballad and is a good closing track.    L&T doesn't flow perfectly like Blonde On Blonde but the strength of a majority of these songs pulls this album to the top of Dylan's catalog. It represents the start of another great phase of his musical genius.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This film follows McMurtry's book  so well, as the director notes in the bonus section, that there are virtually no dialogue changes. The DVD comes in a two DVD set with the four parts split evenly between the two with the bonus features as well, The bonus features include interviews with casts, director and author and show some of the films highlights including each one's favorite part. The outdoor scenes, script and acting is top notch. The supreme benefit of this epic is the time spent in character development that allows one to get to know the characters so thoroughly and appreciate the bonds between these men looking for perhaps their last great adventure with young cowboys in tow. Tommy Lee Jones as Texas Ranger Woodrow F. call, possibly his greatest role, and Robert Duval as captain Augustus McCrae  are outstanding with such a great cast with Danny Glover Robert Urich, D. B. Sweeny, the surprising Rick Schroder, Diane Lane, Anjeclica Houston  and the excellent character actor Timothy Scott who plays Pea. The DVD starts in ends with each four parts and, as the director states in the bonus section, it was literally four movies made into one. The scenes are so realistic that even the cattle were bought in Mexico to not just replicate scrawny worn looking animals but they were all those things making the trail dive more realistic.  Tremendous action packed film full of realistic scenes and when Tommy Lee Jones (or his stunt man) slams his horse into a bully's, it certainly looks and feels real. Watching all four sets was delightful but the last one was exhausting as the latter part is one of the saddest in movie history but it pays tribute to the characters played by these great actors as each loss is heartfelt. The dialogue is just tremendous and well delivered, such as when Woodrow beats a man senseless, recovers finally and notes he is being observed by townfolk, expresses simply, \\"I just hate rudeness in  a man.\\"
B001DZDTX6|4.0|The official Amazon reviewer makes it quite plain why people who think Britney Spears and the like good music should not be asked to comment on real music.  She shows little understanding of progressive rock, and should refrain from displaying her ignorance.  Maybe elsewhere she can complain of Beethoven's self-indulgence.    I am not a big fan of Rush, but I will say that I believe this to be one of their best.  A good album of really good music, but nothing to dance to.
185984054X|4.0|In a scathing critique of Mother Teresa and her admirers, Mr. Hitchens asserts Mother Teresa's impeccable reputation and inevitable sainthood status to be granted by the Roman Catholic Church is an \\"illusion\\" concocted by uncritical observers.  Mr. Hitchens purports to judge Mother Teresa's \\"reputation by her actions and words rather than her actions and words by her reputation.\\"    \\"The Missionary Position\\" has the obvious flaw of not giving credit to any of Mother Teresa's lifelong charity work, perhaps because there are tons of \\"strongly devotional\\" publications on her life and work.  Nevertheless, a critical viewpoint such as Mr. Hitchens', however biased and unsettling, is necessary as a balancing act.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love the books and the show stays pretty true to the books in many ways.  Of course the show adds many things that are not in the books and it changes things - but the ideas and main character are wonderful.  It is HBO and thus there are a LOT of sex scenes and blood- so not for the shy or to watch with the kids.  My husband also enjoyed the show, characters and story even though he has not read the books.  I hope HBO keeps it up!
1408800489|5.0|I am half-way through this book and already thinking about rereading it to pick up anything I may have missed in my compulsion to read \\"just one more letter\\" before I set the book aside for the day!  The characters are genuine and well-developed.  The era (post-WWII) is well-researched and described. The plot development through the correspondence of its characters is amazingly well done!  It all comes together to provide a terrific read!  (The copy I am reading is borrowed, and I have decided that I will have to buy my own copy to add to my library.  It's that good!)
B002BPQ0Y2|2.0|I'm all for bands trying different techniques and crossing into other genres, but not when this is the result. When I first heard \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" on the radio I remember thinking - \\"seriously?\\" None of the other songs on their new album are any better. With such an impressive history of the band, and the member's solo careers, you'd think they could've pulled off something much better than this. It seems that in the Black Eyed Peas case, they should stick to the Hip Hop style that's made them famous. If this is the kind of music they're going to release, I think that the energy has indeed died for the Black Eyed Peas.

No response, ignored, and I had to go through Amazon to get my money back. The seller finally contacted me when he had to return the money, stating that 'he was out of town.'

B00003CX8Y|2.0|im glad i got this movie although i can clearly tell it is a burned copy.  I can tell by the cover and all the extra papers that are inside, they have been copied, as for the movie itself while watching it, it is really not clear and distorted just like when you burn a dvd and the big thing is the chapter symbol at the top right of the screen does not go away.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I saw the movie twice and had to have the sound track.  All the songs are very true to the ABBA originals and just as much fun.
B000059TFO|5.0|I am amazed at this average rating for this movie(4 stars?). There are movies that stink to high heaven getting 4 and 1/2 stars and even five. Incredible. Mississippi Burning is a very hard film to look at but a very truthful and gritty look at racism in southern Mississippi during the Civil Rights era.<br /><br />The story details FBI agents Rupert Anderson(Gene Hackman)and Alan Ward(Willem Dafoe) search for the killers an African-American male and two Jewish males. Their search takes them to the heart of Mississippi where the  racism is deep-seated and the police are inflexible to a fault. They later realize how deep the police involvement in the killings were.<br /><br />No other movie about race relations has moved me like Mississippi Burning has. American History X is phenomenal but it didnt make me as angry as this movie did. I wish I had the power to stop these psychos from doing what they did. Mississippi Burning was the movie that made me question my faith in organized religion. I couldn't fathom that I was believing in the same belief system that these lunatics were believing in. I dumped belief in organized religions after extensive research at the age of 20 but this movie sparked my curiosity. Gene Hackman is wonderful as Agent Rupert. He steals every scene he is in. Willem Dafoe is great as his partner Alan Ward. Agent Anderson(Hackman) handles things in an unconventional manner while Agent Ward(Dafoe) is by the book. This is where Dafoe showed his true potential before he started screwing up his career by appearing in sewage like Speed 2, Boondock Saints, Body Of Evidence and XXX: State Of The Union. Also great in this movie is Brad Dourif  as the racist Deputy Clinton Pell and R. Lee Ermey as the racist mayor. I also like how they showed the views of the average ignorant Mississippian and how the cops either participated in the killing and terrorizing of Blacks in Mississippi or sat back and watched it happen.<br /><br />Conclusion: Mississippi Burning is the best movie of 1989 hands down and is definitely required viewing. But be forewarned that this is not an easy movie to watch. But if you can stomach the violence you have a gem on your hands. I find it sad that the director Alan Parker didnt have many movies after this one.1989 hands down and is definitely required viewing. But be forewarned that this is not an easy movie to watch.

1401203078|5.0|Most of the complaints I've read on this page can be summarized as \\"waaaah this book is too haaaaaard\\"    Fact is, this is flat out ****ing genius.  Read it with Wikipedia open, read the annotations, look at it all carefully.  There's so much here.    The book is absolutely freakin' genius.  It's something along the lines of the Wold Newton Family created by Philip Jose Farmer, but far more brilliant and wide ranging.  Alan is tying together not just a brilliant fictional architecture but also explaining how that fictional architecture has informed our own reality and history.    This is an encyclopedia of popular fiction, and a history of our myths and legends.  This is the kind of book that people will be writing about our century a hundred years from now, written today.    It's not for everyone, sure, but if you're willing to put in the effort it is absolutely worth it.

He blessed all of us. Thank you MJ. I pray your resting in peace.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Not all of the humor in Tropic Thunder works (obviously this applies to basically every comedy, but the \\"Simple Jack\\" stuff falls embarrasingly flat) but the characters are interesting and likable, there are a bunch of belly laughs to be had, and the film is enjoyable enough to be worth recommending even if it's not the end-all be-all of comedy.
0671027344|1.0|I thought this book was ok, but not a 'must' read. The main character Charley was someone I cared about when I was reading, but forgot about as soon as I stopped reading.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Vicky Cristina Barcelona is enjoyable enough but it's a completely lightweight film which undercuts itself at every turn with the most redundant, bland-sounding, and ridiculously unnecessary narration that I can remember (\\"Vicky and Cristina then went to dinner with Juan Antonio...Vicky and Cristina then  returned to their hotel room\\"); it's quick-moving and well-acted but by no means an accomplished film.    2.5/4

B001PJRAUS|4.0|I bought this DVD thinking it was going to be similar to the book \\"Lost in Austen\\".  This DVD is actually about a twenty-something year old women you walks through a cupboard in her home and is transported to Elizabeth Bennett's home in the 1800's.  Elizabeth has been waiting for her chance to sneak over to current day London and so the swap is made.  The film then carry's on in the 1800's with a modern day woman trying to adapt to it.  By the end of the film she has messed up everything with just about everyone and realizes that she has done so.  As she returns to current day London she realizes that she has learned a lot about herself and is able to do things she hadn't thought of doing before like getting rid of the dead beat boyfriend on her couch.  Best of all is Darcy who wins her heart!  The film was entertaining.  Was it a better than the real story of Pride and Prejudice? Definitely not. Was it a refreshing look at the Bennett family? No. I liked the original characters from Pride and Prejudice much better than in this film (though Wickhams character in this movie is much nicer than in Pride and Prejudice).  However, if you were to view this movie as a stand alone story and not constantly compare it to the book Pride and Prejudice, you will enjoy it.  It was fun to see what was going to happen and it wasn't completely predictable as movies often are with a similar storyline.

0670020745|5.0|Before writing this review, I read both the 5 star and 1 star reviews already submitted on this book. I can honestly say I felt the 1 star people completely misunderstood the truly important messages the author provides us in this book. She gives people hope who struggle with neurocognitive or brain-based medical problems. She highlights in perfect detail the eagerness of the brain to repair itself. Secondly, she helps the reader understand how \\"our inner voice\\" (the left brain area) can be turned off, so negative thoughts can be controlled. She also did a fantastic job helping the reader understand the importance of appreciating everyday, how to speak and act toward stroke victims, and recognize good and bad energy in others. These are just a few things I got from these teriffic book. The book is not really 'touchy-feely' at all. It's the celebration of a person who, through very hard work, got her life back, and more.
B001TODCII|4.0|I did not see this movie in the theater and saw it for the first time about a month ago on DVD. I was very impressed. Although this movie had a lot of violence (especially the extended unrated version), the violence was necessary based on the subject matter.    I think every teenage girl and young woman should see this movie. Both Amanda and Kim, the two teenage girls portrayed in the movie were very naive and too trusting and therefore easy prey for the sex slave merchants. Their actions practically said \\"take me, I am here alone in a strange city with no one to protect me\\". Not every young female is going to have an ex-CIA dad to save them.    What I liked about Liam Neeson character is even after his daughter and her friend were kidnapped, he didn't berate his wife with \\"I told you so, you just didn't listen\\". He seemed more interested in getting his daughter back safe rather than making his ex feel guilty and foolish.

B001NLL0RW|3.0|James Rollins has been one of my favorite authors for years. I wait with anticipation for each new book he writes. This book has a couple of good twists but I found it lacking any kind of depth to the story line. It was almost like he was asleep at the wheel while writing or in too much of a rush to get the next book finished. I found myself wondering how much more of the book I had to read. In addition, was it really necessary to throw in the blatant political football of \\"Don't ask, Don't tell\\"?  This book was not in keeping with Mr. Rollins great talent of entertaining.
B000654YS8|4.0|I'll keep this short and start off by admitting I'm a huge DS fan.  Knopfler certainly doesn't have the greatest voice however you have to admit the man does know his way around a guitar.  You can certainly argue this point but I believe Money for Nothing is close to the greatest rock song of all time; I love the unique melody and lyrics, humourous point of view, unusual video animation, etc.  Many videos on the disc are not all that noteworthy however MfN just about makes the dvd worth the price all by itself.
B001CT877Q|5.0|This review is simply for the Blu-Ray quality, which is very good. I'm glad I bought this as I like the movie.
B000654YRY|4.0|I love DS and this concert includes all their great hits.  I'm disappointed that the sound is only two channel however the concert was recorded back in the 90s and at least the quality is excellent.  After a bit you get involved with the performance and the lack of surround doesn't seem to matter.  Great performances, especially Knopfler, a huge guitar talent who doesen't seem to be all that involved with the performance at times however performs tremendously in spite.  Percussion was also faultless.  If you like DS you will like this DVD.
6305882592|5.0|If you like dark humor, you should enjoy this video.  I've watched it many (10+) times.  If you watch it more than once, you may notice subtle things that you may have missed during the first viewing.  I will watch it yet again in the near future.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|This was a gift for my husband, he loves it. We like it so well that we are going to see Nickelback in concert. Also would like to thank Amazon for easy order process, quick shipment and most of all the great customer service they provide.
0061673730|5.0|There are many things to like about this book. It is thought provoking, it contains some excellent insights, and the pace of the story works for the subject matter. Overall, at the end of the book, I was a bit disappointed because Pirsig didn't wrap things up as well as thought he should've, but I still give it five stars because the work is thought-provoking and well written. Unlike most novels which leave me cold, this one is chock full of philosophical ideas and questions that are important and worth pondering. Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope
B00004VVN9|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and still love it! I still it watch now and then.<br />Too bad they did not make a sequel, but then again, good they didn't cause the sequels are usually duds!<br />I love the idea of the invention, it would be great to be able to see, feel, taste, where it would be impossible to actually experience personally!
B002ECE8A0|3.0|I'm really torn over this one.  On the one hand, it's great to have this classic book in a Kindle edition.  On the other, whoever proofread this should find another line of work.    The font formatting (italics, etc) is completely absent.  The paragraphs are almost all mashed together.  For every ten paragraphs in the original, this version gives us maybe one.      If you've read this book many times, you can, perhaps, get something out of this version if you remember the book well.  (Of course, you may find this version as heartbreaking as I did.)  If you've never read the book, this will be a hard slog, and without Bradbury's carefully chosen pacing, a lot is lost.    The story is easily five stars.  The formatting for this version is one.  Hence, three stars.  Three stars which weep in a black velver sky, while circus tents grow, like mushrooms, in the dark.    I hate typing these next four words: skip the Kindle version.
1433502445|5.0|We purchased two of these bibles for two High school graduates (our son and his girlfriend) based upon the fact that it was rated number one in the reviews we read.  Since then they've had a chance to utilize them and have appreciated the clear writing style and the study aids.  I was particularly impressed with the interactive aspect of the product.  Gods Word was not made better, just more accessible.
1416914307|4.0|This is the third and final story in the Mortal Instruments trilogy.  Personally, I feel that it was the best one, but then again, I'm a sucker for happy endings.  Throughout the books, I couldn't quite shake the feeling that I had met the main character, Clary, in another story.  Then my latest Janet Evanovich book arrived and I realized, she's a supernatural Stephanie Plum.  Inept, adventurous, blindly throwing herself into dangerous situations, yet somehow comes out with the two lead men still desiring her.<br /><br />Of the three novels, this one stood out.  I really enjoyed the almost medieval world atmosphere of Idris within a modern context.  The tension between the main characters was appropriate.  The action throughout the story was well-paced and appropriate for the plot.  Overall, it just seemed to flow better.  As far as Jace is concerned, one can't help but feel sorry for him with all of the twists and turns regarding his origins.  He's not a likeable character, but seems to make some progress in honoring his surprising roots.<br /><br />In the end, all is well. I guess if you enjoy novels like Breaking Dawn, then you'd probably enjoy this one as well.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|The product is great. The only thing I don't like is there are many discs crammed in thin sleeves. It seems like it would break easily.
B00164GDD2|1.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND HATE TO GIVE IT A 1 BUT THIS IS NOT BLU RAY QUALITY, THERE IS NO WAY THEY HAVE DONE ONE UPGRADE TO THIS FILM VERY GRAINY. I KEEP CHECKING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANOTHER VERSION OF THE MOVIE ON THIS DISK IT IS THAT BAD. SAVE YOUR MONEY
1573229725|5.0|I love, love, love this book.  I first read it soon after it came out, and revisited it recently.  Waters has a gift for lyrical prose and constructing an intricate narrative of layers upon layers; each incident or character, no matter how minor at the time, assumes crucial significance later, hardly any word or phrase is superfluous, and what is not said is often more important than what is. A number of the darker aspects of the novel are merely hinted at, not spelt out. The language of the dialogue and narrative evokes the period beautifully.<br /><br />I won't attempt to summarise the plot; a number of reviewers have already done so.  Suffice it to say that anyone looking for a Victorian-era \\"romp\\" or \\"cozy\\" may find that this book is not for them.  This is a much bleaker and more confusing world, where as soon as you think you've figured out what is going on, everything is turned on its head, and nothing - and no-one - is straightforward.  The characters are well developed, distinct individuals, who at times are not particularly likeable or sympathetic, but are fundamentally human.  Even Waters' most appalling characters have some redeeming qualities, and are capable of making you feel something for them; nothing is black and white.  I thought the love story between Maud and Susan was really nicely done; the \\"romance\\" element is not the most important part of the story.<br /><br />\\"Fingersmith\\" is a long and at times challenging read - sometimes it moves quite slowly, and it's not going to appeal to everyone - but very much a worthwhile one.  Highly recommended.
1416550542|5.0|This book was a \\"can't put down\\" read.  The characters are so well written that they become real. I enjoyed the descriptions of Bisbayne and old England.
B000059H98|5.0|This was the first time I had heard of the movie. It was funny from beginning to end. We bought the movie because my husband wanted it. The movie was better than the title depicts.
B000SZZXMW|4.0|If you weren't around back in the day of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers featuring Peter Green, or Peter Green's original Fleetwood Mac, this is the next best thing. As others have said, it captures Green's sound almost perfectly. As far as I know, Gary Moore still owns and sometimes plays Peter's old Les Paul with the reversed neck pickup, and it's still a great, great sound. I'm not as fond of Moore's vocals in Peter's place, but they're still pretty darn good on most tracks. \\"Sing on singer, play on drummer\\"...
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael shockingly passed away yesterday, and like so many of us, I replayed quite a bit of my CD collection of his (and I have all of it), and there is no doubt in my mind that this stands as the absolutely best collection of MJ music, anywhere.<br /><br />\\"HIStory: Past, Present and Future - BOOK 1\\" (1995 release; 2 CDs, 30 tracks; 157 min.) brings the best of all worlds. CD1 brings Michael's greatest hits, with a heavy dosis of \\"Thriller\\" of course, but many of his highlights from \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Bad\\" and \\"Dangerous\\" too. But the real meat for me is CD2 (15 tracks; 77 min.), which brings 15 then-new songs. It was quite controversial at the time, combining a greatest hits set with a new album. But the songs from that 2nd CD demonstrated that Michael was far from finished and had TONS of great music left in him. The first half of the new album sounded as good as anything he had done, with great stuff like \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\", the pensive \\"Stranger in Moscow\\", the biting \\"This Time Around\\", the epic \\"Earth Song\\", \\"D.S.\\" with its great guitar riff, and the urgent \\"Money\\". The second half of the album falters slightly, but not much, check out the self-aware \\"Tabloid Junkie\\", the all-out \\"2 Bad\\" and the HIStory title track. Wow, just a fabulous album in its own right.<br /><br />I bought this release the day it came out in 1995, and was incredibly excited by the release of new music from MJ. Now 14 years later, if anyone asked me to take only MJ album with me on a desert island, \\"HIStory\\" surely would be it. It pains me to have seen Michael go down the weirdness of the last 10 years, but it will not diminish his place in music history. The man was a musical genius, and this collection is the best testament to it: it brings you his greatest hits, and a second CD that equally resonates to me now than when it came out 14 years ago. A close second in my collection is the 2 CD \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\", which brings 38 tracks covering his entire output from \\"I Want You Back\\" to \\"You Rock My World\\". RIP Michael Jackson, you will never be forgotten.u Back\\" to \\"You Rock My World\\". RIP Michael Jackson, you will never be forgotten.
B00000F14B|5.0|I say if you have not sen this musical you have missed one fo the greats!!!
B00138JAD6|5.0|I had this album in the late 70's. Lost it in a move, I'm glad I finally   found it again. Bob Dylan did a fine job on Slow Train Coming.
B00005QGAT|5.0|Off The Wall is actually my favorite album by Michael, itz hard to believe but yes it is, I lvoe Thriller of course. Im' sad that  he is gone i still can't believe it , i want it to be a stunt but no one would find that funny. I just think itz too shocking to think he is gone. I never personally saw him in concert and I'll never get the chance. But there are some many memories that it probably doesn't matter. His legacy will live on RIP Michael Jackson
B002B4AAS0|5.0|I finished watching Mark's documentary twice, a story of exploration, where he retrospectively journeys into the life of his late Father Hugh Everett who was a remarkable physicist. Hugh is known for his paper on parallel universe that throws a new light on Neils Bohr's perspective of quantum physics. Hugh's battles with world renowned physicists and his ups and downs were not noticed by Mark, until Hugh passed away suddenly due to a heart failure at the age of 51.     Mark hardly ever talked with his Dad when he was alive, partly because his Dad was lost in deep thought and research work, and partly because of the ups and downs he went through while trying to convince his theory of parallel universes to the world's renowned physicists.     Mark knew he had to find out more about his Dad's journeys through his life. He set out to meet all the professors and government officials with whom Hugh had worked and interacted during his life. He also went back and transferred all the dictaphone tapes of his Dad's meetings to a known format to get more clues on his possible journey.    Mark's efforts have proved to be successful, as more people today are aware of his father's outstanding contribution to physics. Over the years, Mark realized that his father was too early for his time and the world was not ready for such a radical theory.    When I listen to Mark's music, I can hear the story, agony, joy, disappointing, frustration and excitement in his singing. I really think Mark is a really talented musician, and also in many ways you will realize that he is very much like his Dad. Mark has re-discovered himself through his Dad's story and his music ability and is a whole new person after he finished doing the biography of his Dad.    I really enjoy Mark's music, his song writing ability and the uniqueness of his talent.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|Ten years ago I heard Jennifer Lopez's first single \\"If You Had My Love\\" on VH1 and really liked it (I later brought the single for this song as well). This led me to buy the \\"On the 6\\" because I was really enthusiastic about it (I also had a connection at the store I regularly shopped at who sold the album to me before the release date). Once I put the CD in my computer and later on my Creative NOMAD II MP3 player, songs from this album were in constant rotation. As I look back on it now, I realize that Lopez's voice is annoying and that songs such as \\"Let's Get Loud\\", \\"Feeling So Good\\", and a few other cuts on this album were really stupid and didn't work. The only non-stupid tracks on the album that actually work are \\"If You Had My Love\\" and \\"Waiting for Tonight\\"; it is because of these tracks I still own this album no matter how much I regret it. After this experience I realized that I was fooled by the hype this album generated. I haven't been fooled by hype since - knock on wood.

I struggled to finish it. I must admit, I wanted to return it to Barnes & Noble after reading the first few pages.<br /><br />I really wanted to love it... I didn't. I wanted to like it... not so much.<br /><br />I found it to be like lukewarm soup on a blustery day.<br /><br />Lexi Smart annoyed me. I wondered where the fun, lovable, naturally charming characters Sophie Kinsella brings to her zany novels were hiding.<br /><br />I wasn't looking for a thinly veiled Becky, but give me something.<br /><br />I questioned Lexi quite a bit. Lexi's big change didn't seem believable. It just seemed forced.<br /><br />Sophie definitely did her research on amnesia, but she should of developed Lexi a bit more.<br /><br />Remember Me is not one of Sophie Kinsella's best novels & Lexi is not one of her best characters.<br /><br />Definitely not worth the $$$ I spent for the hardcover.<br /><br />Fans of Kinsella's will no doubt add this to their shelves.

B0000640SA|5.0|We all know the typical mystery movie. A mans wife is killed and needs to seek out the killer and other people get thrown into the story. Now take that concept and show it to the movie going public....backwards! What you get is Christopher Nolans' masterpiece 'Memento'.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Eventhough you know exactly how the movie is going to end you are just waiting to see how the story got to that very point. A story like keeps you watching and thinking and that's probably why this movie is praised by millions. The cast is phenomenal and package is perfect. The funny thing is Nolan is now this huge director because of his re-inventing the Batman franchise. People may soon...forget that he was just as good of a director before that. That's why this film should be a true...memento for your collection. It is such an incredible movie it is not to be missed.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Terminator 2 in my opinion is hte greatest action movie ever made. Why? Emotion, special effects, great acting, etc. Let's talk about why this blu ray is the best ever made.<br /><br />1.) For a movie made in 1991, the transfer is flawless. It looks a lot better than the previous blu ray version.<br />2.) The sound is amazing! (Dolby 6.1) The fact that they included a headphones sound option is fantastic! I watched it once with my Bose Quite Comfort 2 headphones, and it blew me away how awesome it was!!!!<br />3.) They have most of the features (all of the good ones at least) from the last two versions of the movie on DVD.<br />4.) We have all three versions of the movie and I love the extended special edition version the best. A must watch.<br /><br />The sound alone is worth the price.<br /><br />Get it. A must for any action fan, and a must for any blu ray owner.
B001CTDH76|5.0|It is tough to produce something new and different in a TV police procedural, but \\"The Mentalist\\" succeeds in its highly entertaining first season.  Simon Baker (The Guardian) returns to TV as Patrick Jane, former wealthy (and fake) psychic who made the mistake of mocking a serial killer on television.  The serial killer, Red John, retaliated by slaughtering Jane's wife and young daughter.  Jane is now a consultant with the California Bureau of Investigation.<br /><br />Jane assists a squad of detectives run by one Theresa Lisbon.  His contributions to investigations are his remarkable powers of observation and an almost disturbing ability to read people.  Balanced against these talents are a low threshold of boredom and a boyish charm that lets him get away with most of the pranks he plays on his squadmates and on the occasional suspect.<br /><br />Robin Tunney does a nice job as the patient and highly professional Lisbon.  Not less often than once a show, she gets talked into bending procedure to enable Jane to solve a case.  Lisbon is properly wary of what she rightly identifies as Jane's achilles heel, his thirst for revenge on Red John.  She may have a certain cautious fondness for Patrick Jane as well.<br /><br />The rest of the squad provides a nice ensemble feel to the episodes: Amanda Righetti as attractive, ambitious Grace Van Pelt; Tim Kang as the wonderfully deadpan Kimbro Cho; and hulky Owain Yeoman as Wayne Rigsby, who suffers through the season with a terrible crush on Grace.<br /><br />Each episode features a new case, typically a murder with unusual circumstances to which Jane can apply his talents.  Each case has enough plot wrinkles to keep the viewer guessing along with the detectives.  The show succeeds as a drama while retaining a nice touch of humor through the interaction of the squad members.  The thread running through the season is Jane's hunt for clues to the identity and whereabouts of Red John, a search that will lead to a thrilling and disturbing season finale.<br /><br />\\"The Mentalist: The Complete First Season\\" is very highly recommended as a new and entertaining version of the standard police procedural.  \\"The Mentalist\\" has been renewed for a second season beginning in September 2009.\\"The Mentalist: The Complete First Season\\" is very highly recommended as a new and entertaining version of the standard police procedural.  \\"The Mentalist\\" has been renewed for a second season beginning in September 2009.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|There are so many reviews on these 3 films that I will just comment on the quality of the restoration. This has to be one of the top 5, if not the best, jobs done on film restoration to date. Paramount used one of the best restoration labs in the world, owned by Warner Brothers, to restore this film only after a Kodak owned lab cleared it as being sturdy enough to run through the digitizing equipment. The whole restoration was spurred by a letter to Spielberg from Coppola asking him if he could get Paramount, who had recently been bought by Viacom if they would do a restoration on the Godfather films. The head of Paramount didn't even hesitate to cut the large check to fund the restoration. The result? Coppola says its more beautiful then he remembered it. The extent of the restoration is included on the Bonus disc. And in that the clip you will see that the filmographer instead of filming the scenes correctly exposed and then having the lab darken the frames went with shooting the scenes dark, the result being there is no detail in the black areas of the film. This explains how difficult it was to get this quality of a restoration, which meant finding the best copy available, which still left much to be desired, and going frame my frame and digitally correcting the image. What is impressive is that the WB Studio lab consulted the original filmographer. I don't know if there is an Academy Award for restoration, but if there is, I know this team deserves it.<br /><br />NOTE: There seems to be some here that don't like the way the film looks. I suggest they watch Emulsional Rescue - Revealing the Godfather on the bonus disc. Anyone that buys the set, may want to watch it first too to see how the films were shot, underexposed and with an orange tint, and the care taken to restore that look and even in 1 scene improve on it. Watching this feature first will show that its the way it was shot and meant to look, not the restoration.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I just discovered these guys.  Gibbard's sensitive voice and Chris Walla's guitar and keyboards are a perfect match.  The single \\"Soul Meets Body\\" has a great melody quickened to an electronic cadence.  Then he panders to boyish nostalgia while shedding his \\"Summer Skin.\\" \\"I Will Follow You into the Dark\\" is simply vocals and acoustic guitar in an emotional love song addressing impending death.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|This is a great film and the wide screen edition makes it enjoyable.  However, as another reviewer mentions, it does not maximize the screen, but provides only a long narrow view of the film.      One of the best features is the 2nd DVD with producers' infor and comments.  It is very interesting and well worth the time to view it.  It provides an even greater appreciation of the film.      Amazon's service was great.
B00005MCX2|4.0|The vocals recording quality isn't so good, however, that make the Cd sounds really 'live'. The drums and bass performance was amazing.
B000002WPI|5.0|I first bought this cd back in 1993 when it was released. I was like wow this is pretty different. Raw and edgy with a couple great tracks in CREAM and Can It Be All So Simple. Played it for a about a month and put it away, taking the odd listen now and then. Believe it or not I ended up selling it to a used CD store in 1997 for $4........definitely not one of the smartest things I've done in life.  Fast forward to the mid 2000's and the beginning of the downfall of contemporary hip hop. Looking for a change I reintroduced myself to 36 Chambers and was blown away. I have played this cd no less than 200 times over the past four years, probably more than any other cd in that time period. I've really gained an appreciation for the geniusness of the RZA. His production here is immaculate. It flows, it portrays a mood in the listener's mind and it reveals a pattern. Dark, grimy, moody, raw and powerful. To pull that off with 9 different emcees contributing to the record speaks volumes about his abilities.   There are some lyrical standouts on this album too. The best one could very well be from one of the lesser lites, Masta Killa, on 'Da Mystery of Chessboxin':  \\"The flow changes like a chameleon  Plays like a friend and stabs you like a dagger.  This technique attacks the immune system  Disguised like a lie, paralyzin' the victim\\"    A true classic in hip hop history this album was very good when it came out in 1993 and nothing short of amazing here in 2009. I would recommend this to any fan of true hip hop. 5 stars.
B00005QGAV|5.0|For various reasons, too personal to be appropriate or meaningful for public review, I this was my favorite MJ release.  But, perhaps, that was at the heart of Michael's greatness, the ability to get deeply personal, on a universal level, with a hot beat.
006097625X|5.0|Put aside any notions you may carry that comic books are for kids. In fact, tuck away any notion that comics are just for fun too, because McCloud takes readers on a journey through history, culture, time, and space in Understanding Comics. He does it all with a great wit and an eye for the kinds of things a casual observer might miss. In fact, so much of this book is about what you DON'T SEE in a comic and why that is just as important as what you do see.<br /><br />This is college course material, hands down. No student or creator can pass this gem up and believe they have received a solid education on visual story-telling.<br /><br />After writing an impressive history of comics that explores the foundational linguistic methodology of a marriage between art and story, McCloud plunges into the philosophical depths of representation and Platonic Idealism. And if that last sentence conjures up images of a boring college classroom and a rambling professor, then forget it because McCloud couples all this knowledge with a sense of humor that burns through fabulous illustrations on every page.<br /><br />Learning has never been this much fun. This is must have book, don't miss the chance to own it and allow it to transform not just the way you see comic books, but the way you view the world as well.
