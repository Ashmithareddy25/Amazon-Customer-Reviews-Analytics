B0055QYKQO|1.0|I bought this motherboard on February 1st and installed it about a month later because I live in Caracas, Venezuela, the installation went very well and the motherboard worked perfectly until two weeks ago over here began to fade and frozen , because of that I update the BIOS version (F8) but did not work, the processor voltage began to change and this is what was causing the processor to overheat and shut down the PC accordingly so I decided to return to the previous bios version (F1) with no explanation of that, the downgrade process of the BIOS version occurred as expected and after that the computer was restarted as part of the installation process of the bios, after that the computer turns on but the screen stays black all the time without giving me the possibility to something. I don't speak english very well so I do my best.

B0040QDMBE|4.0|This book is an excellent analysis of what is wrong with capitalism. As has occurred in many religions throughout history with devastating circumstances, capitalism has been hijacked and twisted by zealots for their own glorification and enrichment. Capitalism is meant to reward those who contribute to the economy not reward those who add little or no value but skim off the top.

0439023483|3.0|This book is a pretty good read, but not incredible.  The premise is compelling and exciting.  The post-apocalyptic world that Collins has created is interesting and convincing, and the story has the potential to be very dramatic.  Unfortunately, the writing leaves a lot to be desired.  There is very basic vocabulary, the attention to detail is lacking, and the most dramatic scenes in the book seem to last about 10 seconds!  I understand that it's for younger readers, but I think most teenagers could handle a little bit more substantial writing.  Look at Harry Potter, for example; a great story accompanied with great writing!<br /><br />The main problem is that the writing style doesn't match the story.  A teen is pitted in a gruesome match to the death, filled with stress and intense emotion, starvation and thirst, injury, love and hatred, but I did not get this sense while reading the book.  It felt more like a teenager playing a soccer game who is merely annoyed by her opponents and overly worried about her own image.  The writing is very light and filled with sarcasm and it just didn't seem SERIOUS enough considering the SERIOUSNESS of the situation!<br /><br />In addition, there is nothing in this but descriptions of action.  There isn't much foreshadowing, allegory, mystery, or any other literary devices that make books interesting to read, and the vocabulary is elementary at best.  Also, there are many scenes where something monumental occurs, and it takes about two paragraphs to describe it.  It leaves you thinking, \\"that's it?  We're moving on already?\\"<br /><br />I would still recommend reading it because it's a short, fun, easy read with a pretty good plot, but don't expect anything amazing.  I have only read the first book and I plan on reading the other ones.  Hopefully they get a little more mature (I mean in writing style, not necessarily content), but I am still interested to see what happens next.  It seems to be the kind of book that would make a pretty good movie, so I'm definitely going to see that when it comes out.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I'm not going to spoil anything or blow your mind with this review. If you want in depth on how it relates to politics, religion, or some other deeper meaning you will not get that from me.<br /><br />I'm simply going to say that it was a great read. It was entertaining all the way through, it had a few slow parts in my opinion, but nothing that lasted long. It had a lot of different emotions, relationships, and twists to keep me intrigued through the whole book. I was able to fly through the book once I got into it, and that did not take long. I will say that this book leads well to the second book.

B00000JMOJ|5.0|Great movie. Loved every second of it years ago and still enjoy it. Bought it from Amazon a few months ago and have watched it at least 3 times since. I don't know if I'm showing my age or what but I still prefer the older movies to the newer ones. Even the special effects in the running area were great. I'd suggest this if you like movies with a lot of fighting without a lot of gore.
B004W89N72|4.0|Ill just stay with that app because it sync with Google calendar as well as it is much more flexible and easier to use, if you remember it was the FAOTD of a while ago (the bugs have been fixed and new features have been added) if this is your first calendar app then its a good start, but I cant place it in the top line of calendar apps.

B00005LK94|5.0|My 3-year-old Grandson saw this movie on a movie channel on tv and was mesmerized.  He cried when it went off and kept saying he wanted to watch it again.

B00679T1EO|4.0|My wife and I love this show.  We're completely addicted.  After watching the PBS version of the first few episodes on TV, we went to order the blu rays.  When I saw that there were two different versions and the comments about them, I ordered the UK versions.  They are SO much better than the PBS version.  Some plot points are even missed in the edited PBS version.  You also get to see a lot more of the house, which is so beautiful, in the UK version.  The only comment I would make is that this particular version of the blu ray does not appear to have the Christmas special.  However, the same seller I purchased from had the UK version of that for $26, not the $50 of another version.  Anyway, enjoy, but know that if you want EVERY drop of Downton Abbey goodness, you'll have to order Christmas at Downton Abbey separately.  That's also the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

B004SIMNF0|5.0|The Spider Pro Camera Holster is an impressive, well built solution for strap free DSLR carrying. This product prevents straps from tangling (when using two cameras), allows a quick draw, keeps your camera secure at your hip and is very versatile. The design is simple and elegant, made up of a strong adjustable belt (with a reassuring buckle), a metallic holster, a plate that attaches to the tripod socket of your camera, and a pin (that you screw into the plate. The plate has many different holes for precise placement of the pin on your camera (depending on how you would prefer it to hang at your side), as well as for attaching a quick release plate for use with a tripod. So there is no need to remove the Spider Pro plate when using a tripod. The kit includes an Allen wrench for tightening and it conveniently tucks away inside the plate so you always have it on you. As soon as you adjust and tighten everything to your liking and strap it on, it just feels like a professional, strong reliable product. You will not be disappointed! Plus, You look like a gunslinger which is a bonus on the overall appearance scale.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|I recently downloaded this book through one of Amazon's $2 Kindle book promotions. I would have to say that overall I enjoyed the book although I found myself not that found of any of the characters in this book.  First and foremost Ignatius J. Reilly the protagonist of this story begins the story as a lazy disgusting excuse for a person and pretty much maintains this persona through the entire story. It seems the Ignatius isn't happy unless his slothful ways are causing problems for other people around him.  Rather it is a fight in the streets outside of the Night of Joy, yelling in a movie theater or writing a letter that could potentially cause another man his livelihood Ignatius seems to not care in the least how his actions affect others. Irene Reilly seems in the begging to be the one sane character in the book but I quickly came to realize that she seems to be nothing me than an enabler for Ignatius' wild antics. Myrna Minkoff really starts off as the craziest character in the novel but towards the end of the novel I came to believe that Myrna was the only sane person in this whole crazy book. Despite the fact that Myrna seems to be an over privileged Jewish beatnik that concentrates all of her energy on the sexual revolution she is the only genuine good person in this novel. Even though this book is completely fiction and is set in a wild and crazy setting it feels sometimes like I can relate to these characters because they act like real people. I could see myself in some of the situations in this novel. Overall this was a good read and I would recommend it. I'm not sure that it lived up to all of the hype that I read about the novel before I read it. It's definitely worth reading however.
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is great. Simple game play, but fun and lots of new goals to keep you playing again and again.

B002ZG974M|5.0|This film is great for new moms who want to set their minds at ease - there is more than one way to raise your baby. It also makes you realize we are all very similar! Totally worth seeing!
B004RE29PO|3.0|Alien #1 has superb photography, combined with a rather weak story line, where the characters make<br />just about every possible mistake they can to ensure disaster. Imagine a Joe-six pack crew in charge of<br />a space freight-liner. They seem about as astute as your average city-bus driver. Of course, the Alien<br />creature makes mince meat of them all. Sigourney seems luckier and a tad smarter than the rest of the crew but not by much: she goes looking for kitty while leaving the door of the escape vehicle open as the nuclear blast count down is approaching 25 seconds.<br /><br />Alien #2 unfortunately does not improve much on #1.<br />Your prototypical space suburban family goes treasure hunting, finds the Alien spaceship and repeats<br />every mistake in Alien #1 - not much imagination here. The rest of the movie is chock full of<br />Marine caricatures - a predictable setup before each one of them gets sliced and diced by the baddies.<br />I was hoping for better.  Cherry on the cake is when Ripley goes to fight the queen-mom. Again, she has to go rescue the young girl as the whole power plant is seconds from blowing itself to smithereens....<br />The director obviously did not get paid to be imaginative here.
B0013KTGAG|3.0|I'm a sci-fi fan, so I am always looking for quality sci-fi films to watch. This one falls in the \\"it could have been great\\" category. What would have made this film successful, to me, was some sort of emotional hook. There really was no reason to care about any of the people aboard this ship. It was not until the very end that we see the reason for their journey, and by then I was already disconnected from the movie.<br /><br />Another issue with sci-fi stories is that there must be a successful \\"suspension of disbelief\\". There have been some pretty fantastic ideas put forward in sci-fi that eventually proved to be pretty accurate, so when I watch a good sci-fi film I usually want to at least partially believe the \\"science\\" could represent undiscovered truths. This film succeeded in a broad sense, but I kept asking throughout if this or that would really happen. This served to remove me from the central narrative and lessened my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />The third issue that bothered me about this film was the insertion and depiction of the antagonist. I won't go into details here, but I found the way the antagonist was dealt with very frustrating.<br /><br />Lastly, I feel that a simple explanation of the physical layout of the ship at the start of the film would have made the ensuing events less confusing. Perhaps during the opening credits we could have seen a computer schematic and explanation of the ship itself. I felt the overall depictions of the ship itself were poorly done.<br /><br />All in all, not a bad film. It just had a few issues that prevented me from really getting into it and suspending my disbelief.

B00168OIP8|5.0|While no Academy Award Winner, I'd forgotten what a great movie this is!<br /><br />This was THE movie of 1983, for anyone remotely near their teenage years at the time. Has it really been nearly 30 years? It's easy to bury this in a sea of teenage coming-of-age comedies that were the rage at that time, but this one's a stand-out!<br /><br />The movie that made Tom Cruise's career (well before he became a wack-a-doo tabloid-fodder Scientologist talk-show freak, LOL!). This movie was basically a \\"first\\" for several up-coming '80's actors like Bronson Pinchot (\\"Beverly Hills Cop\\"), Curtis Armstrong (\\"Revenge of the Nerds\\", \\"Moonlighting\\"), Joe Pantoliano (\\"The Soprano's\\"), in addition to the lovely Rebecca DeMornay (\\"Hand That Rocks the Cradle\\") and, of course, Cruise. The \\"Stars\\" (actually not yet quite stars), DeMornay and Cruise, deliver honest performances: you actually believe they are who they're portraying! DeMornay in particular is a standout as a gorgeous, young street-wise yet vulnerable \\"lady of the night\\".<br /><br />Amazing vid and audio quality for a shoe-string budget '80's flick. I've never seen this movie look this good! The moody Tangerine Dream synth soundtrack melds well interspersed with some good 'ole Rock 'n Roll. While the cars, clothes, hairstyles and \\"props\\" may be dated, the movie has aged remarkably well. While there is a certain sense of nostalgia to the piece...for those of us who lived throught the period and were of the same age as the featured actors...you tend to forget that its 1983 and just enjoy the movie.<br /><br />Lots of great movie quotes and memorable scenes abound amongst the outrageous storyline, and they throw in a bunch of extras features, like a \\"making of\\" documenatry, alternate ending, trailer, etc...all mostly in HD (except the Cruise/DeMornay Screen test, which was videotaped at the producer's house). There's also the obligatory comment track by Cruise, the producer, etc.<br /><br />While clearly a reflection of theReaganomics capitalistic mindset pervasive in the early '80's, this is a movie that, IMHO, will resonate with many generations, not just those Baby and post-Baby Boomers who saw this first run! This \\"adolescent\\" comedy is quite a bit darker and much more substantive than the typical ilk that abounded at that time.<br /><br />Highly Recommmended!

B004EBT5CU|5.0|La'Tasha Bryan<br />English 201<br />Professor Chessman<br />Web Review<br /><br /> Music is a type of therapy for people in society. Music speaks the words that people are afraid to tell their soul mate. It can also lift up your spirit. When you're feeling down, you always want to hear songs that can relate to and bring smiles even tears of joy to your face. Adele's CD 21 is one of the best-selling CD in the world today. Her album speaks about her fortunate break up with her ex and how she moves on. Throughout Adele's CD one can get through many things and feel relief.<br /> One of Adele's most famous songs on her album 21 is Rolling in the Deep. The song Rolling in the Deep speaks about how her old soul mate broke up with her and the rage she feels towards him and the break up. Adele states \\"We could have had it all rolling in the deep you had my heart and soul but you played it with a beating\\". However, even though her ex treated her wrong she remembers that they could have had the best relationship in the world. Most females feel that their relationships are going to last forever, or at least they hope it will. Even when a male treats them wrong they still have hope in the relationship lasting forever. What is so special about the album is, Adele makes you feel so connected to her.<br />Each song in her album talks about her own personal life, and what women and males go through in their relationships, from beginning to end. The last song on her album is the perfect song to end it, Someone like you. Someone like you is an extremely special song since, this song talks about the breaking up and moving on. Adele repeats numerous times in her song, \\" Never mind I'll find someone like you\\".  Every girl wants that GIRL POWER songs that will get her right back on her feet and take away her tears. Adele's songs do exactly that.<br />Adele's album 21 is a powerful album. Her cd isn't enough just to download it on I tunes, you have to buy the CD itself. It is rare that you find an album that you can play the whole cd through and jam with your girls to. However Adele's album does just that it brings your sprit up. Everyone should go out and buy Adele's cd because it is just that great.

Though it deals with the horror thrust upon a town occupied by the Germans during WW II, it reminds us that people can pull together even in the worst of times and love far more than they themselves even thought possible. This book teaches us what we have lost in our society. That it's ok to watch out for your neighbor and to love your fellow man,even in our differences, we are the same.

0439813786|5.0|This was such a fun book to read, so rich with the perfect combination of text and drawings. My eight year old son and I took turns reading this one to each other and we both loved it, were enthralled with the story and had a hard time putting it down.  There are pages of text, then pages of drawings, both of which cleverly move the story along.  This book has everything:  adventure, treachery, friendship, history, betrayal, imagination, and a message.<br /><br />The characters are engaging, especially Hugo.  I felt so bad for him and his impossible situation, his grasping at straws to find a connection with his father.  Kids will be rooting for him, wanting him to overcome all of the unfair things in his life.  He is clever and sharp, as well as innovative and passionate.<br /><br />Isabelle is a good foil for Hugo, a young girl, also smart, but in a different way.  The dynamic of their friendship seems real to me, from the way they get along to the way they fight.<br /><br />George Melies is the old man and antagonist of the book,.  Although he is mean to Hugo, he is shrouded in mystery, a mystery that the children are eager to solve.<br /><br />The fictional story of Hugo intermingles with historical France of the 1930s and the history of film.  This is done well, with the pictures as guides.  I loved the mingling of the real history of the film and culture of France with the fictional story of Hugo.<br /><br />The clockwork and automaton part of the plot will really appeal to the imagination and to those who are mechanically inclined or who like steampunk novels.  This, combined with the illustrations, is so cool and vivid.<br /><br />And then there is the ever true underlying message of the book - follow your dreams, this is the way to happiness and fulfillment.<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a wonderful, magical book that instantly captures the imagination.  Although it looks long and may be intimidating to kids, there are so many pictures, at least half the book (284 pages worth).  These are beautiful and well drawn and definitely add to the excitement and drama of the book. This is more than an illustrated book, or a novel with illustrations.  Pick it up and you'll see what I mean.t half the book (284 pages worth).  These are beautiful and well drawn and definitely add to the excitement and drama of the book.

1594202842|2.0|After reading the WSJ article and participating in the discussion online I decided I needed to check the book out of the library and see what the fuss was all about. A few thoughts come to mind....<br /><br />Amy Chua really has quite a bit of disdain for America, Americans, and the American way of doing things. Of course the irony is that the American way of doing things has made her family very successful. Her father worked as a professor at a public, tax-payer funded university after leaving China and coming to the US as a graduate student. While Amy acknowledges her father's problems with his own family's pressures, she never gives America credit for the intellectual freedom her father was able to find. I find it very odd that she does not see this connection and insists the Chinese way is best after all. It is also a bit insulting if you take it personally.<br /><br />Amy ignores completely the historical context and the complexity of the situation that is the American educational system. I find this very odd since she is also a professor. The majority of American parents know quite well their children will have to excel in the sciences and mathematics to compete in the future. Many are trying to make changes in this area. In the past a person had the luxury of studying anything in college. Unemployment was low, food and gas were inexpensive, jobs all had great benefits, etc. This is changing rapidly. I have no doubt the American educational system will adapt to these new challenges - it will just take time. Unfortuneatly for many students and their families the changes will occur too late.<br /><br />So, I guess I feel like this....after all we have done for you? And, given the situation so many children and families are facing today in America, this is all you have to say? No sleepovers or video games? Let's get real.<br /><br />I will give Amy credit for giving American parents a kick in the head, though I do not think that was her intention. While I could never employ her strict methods, I have made significant changes to my childrens' after school homework routines with very positive results so far.<br /><br />As the Chinese say...may you live in interesting times.....ever employ her strict methods, I have made significant changes to my childrens' after school homework routines with very positive results so far.<br /><br />As the Chinese say...may you live in interesting times.....

0811879542|5.0|This is one of the most unique children's books I have ever seen.  I read it to a class of 1st graders and they LOVED it!  In fact, when I went back to read a week later, one of the kids specifically told me he \\"liked that book with the dots\\" that I read last time.  It's creative, educational, and very fun.  The kids learn left from right, and cause and effect.  They were always surprised to see what was on the next page.  It's just a lot of fun to read!  I can see its usefulness for very young children (ages 1-2) also to teach the circle shape and colors.  When they're older, they'll appreciate the other aspects of the book.
B0056HTEC2|3.0|I purchased  the CD with book at 2 different times.  The first one was perfect and we all liked it.  The second one came with a defect on one of the songs.
B006OV7S1I|5.0|It's difficult to really describe this movie. I really like it, though, because it depends on very little violence or nastiness. The tension is built up in such a way that when it gets to any real nastiness, it really messes with you. Even the most peaceful moments in the film have a discomfort just under the surface. A true work of art and an excellent breakout performance from Elizabeth Olsen.

1594203059|2.0|My father-in-law suggested I read this book by mentioning that it endorsed views that are \\"unpopular with liberal academia\\" - a characterization that I principally construed as an endorsement, coming from him.  Niall Ferguson is a Scotsman unabashedly proud of his western heritage.  Full disclosure:  I share with Ferguson some Scottish lineage, but I tend to be more ambivalent about the western heritage part.  Growing up in the suburban northwestern U.S., I was rather put off by the tendency toward self-righteousness - if not outright hypocrisy - of those who proclaimed themselves \\"Christian Americans.\\"  I also tend toward a fierce environmental ethic that rejects exploitation and pollution of the natural world (and other human beings) to slake private greed.  Upon exposure to Asian ways of thinking and being as an undergraduate at Williams College, I enthusiastically pursued their study as a healthier, more harmonious alternative.<br /><br />Ferguson, on the other hand, is out to vindicate western \\"civilization\\" from its doubters and detractors, many of whom (perhaps ironically) are professors at American universities.  I must admit that I was perplexed - if not alienated - by all the scorn heaped upon \\"Dead White Men\\" while I attended Williams in the late `80s and early `90s.  Part of me, then, was eager to see how Ferguson - a tenured history professor at Harvard - defended Western Civ from enemies both foreign and domestic.  Alas, I regret to report that Ferguson falls prey to the very faults that he (quite astutely) identifies as historical weaknesses in Islamic and Asian culture:  smugness, self-satisfaction, lack of curiosity, rejection of otherness, and an inherent incapacity (or stubborn unwillingness) to engage in critical self-examination.<br /><br />Rather than engage in meaningful argument and analysis, Ferguson dismisses any doubt about western dominance (or merit) with grandiose pronouncements and \\"objective\\" statistics such as life expectancy, patents issued, and GDP.  Now, a truly interesting book would set about making the case for why these should be considered worthwhile measures of a civilization's contribution to global good, rather than assuming them as a starting point.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Ferguson has a keen eye for the insightful question, and throughout this work one finds several dozen of them posed, each of which, if pursued with adequate rigor, could lead to dissertation-worthy scholarship.  But Ferguson is in such a hurry to posit his six \\"Killer Apps\\" (an unintentionally ironic label, as will be explained below) that few questions, if any, receive anything more than cursory treatment.  The book's underlying inquiry (if you could call it that) is:  given that Islamic and Asian (and perhaps even South American) civilizations were much better situated than Europe around 1200-1400 CE, how is it that European (western) culture has come to dominate the globe?  This is an intriguing starting point for analysis.  At that time, Europe was wracked with plague and petty infighting while the Ottoman Empire and Middle Kingdom appeared poised for global dominance.  You might have even been able to make a better case for the rise of South American civilizations, such as the Incans or Mayans, instead of Europe at that time.<br /><br />And yet Europe did rise, at the expense of the rest.  Many of the reasons are cogently explained by Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, but Ferguson wants to demonstrate that western dominance has been the product of ideas and willpower more than accidents of history (or microscopic organisms).  His six \\"Killer Apps\\" are Competition, Science, Rule of Law (particularly property law), Medicine, Consumerism, and the Work Ethic (which is unfortunately far too intimately linked to Protestantism).  To my mind, they are presented in essentially descending persuasive order.  I found the chapters on Competition and Science to be rather illuminating.  In Rule of Law, he sets up anintriguing contrast between North and South America, but it's hard not to be appalled by his blithe observation (and failure to wrestle with) the fact that \\"law\\" (and later, science) was viciously used as a rationalization to dislocate and exterminate native peoples.<br /><br />The worm really turns in the chapter on Medicine, much of which is comprised of documenting the ill treatment of Africans by European colonial powers, especially Germany.  Here, ample evidence is right before Ferguson's eyes as to the single greatest reason for western dominance, and yet he completely fails to acknowledge it.  The principal reason for western dominance is simply that it has sought to dominate, at the expense of all else.  Each of his \\"Killer Apps\\" has been more an instrumentality for dominance, rather than the inherent reason for it.<br /><br />In the chapter on Competition, Ferguson seems to implicitly recognize this by contrasting the purposes of the Chinese and Portugese navies in the early 1400s.  The Chinese set sail for Africa seeking trade and tribute, and interacted peacefully with the Black Continent; the Portugese sought blood and treasure and were remorselessly ruthless in their pursuit.  This is where the irony of his moniker \\"Killer Apps\\" truly lies:  for it was the \\"Apps\\" that enabled the killing - which he documents all too well, with ample facts, and yet he never pursues the analysis to its painfully obvious conclusion.<br /><br />Along the way, I couldn't help noticing that this work is interspersed with occasional paeans to Jewish culture that nearly come off as abject pandering.  Why?  There can be no doubting the myriad contributions made to Western Civ by Jews of many nations.  The ill treatment of Jews by their host countries has been, at the risk of understatement, well-documented.  So it is hard to discern why he goes out of his way to highlight Jewish achievements until the final chapter, when he stoops to radical Islamic terrorist fear-mongering the likes of which are normally reserved for Fox \\"News.\\"  This is what we get from a tenured Harvard history professor?  In a book on civilization?  What's next, chants of \\"Bomb Iran\\"?<br /><br />Ferguson closes the book with yet another provocative question:  is the west on the decline, and will China eclipse us by beating us at our own game, using our own \\"Killer Apps\\"?  Though he seems reluctant to do so, Ferguson points to several facts indicating it may already be too late.  Chief among these facts is the insatiable appetite of western governments for borrowing money, much of which is owed to China.  This is an alarming development, no doubt, and citizens throughout the west should be clamoring for greater fiscal responsibility from our ostensible \\"leaders.\\"  He also acknowledges the reality of climate change, but wisely admits an inability to forecast how this will affect civilizations across the globe.  But Ferguson could not be more wrong in his effort to attribute Chinese economic prosperity to the adoption of Christian(!) values.  Anyone who has spent a little time in China over the past several decades knows that this does not even pass the laugh test.  If Ferguson wanted to identify an Asian culture whose success can at least be partially attributed to widespread adoption of Christianity, he should have focused on South Korea - a country which is barely mentioned in passing.<br /><br />Ultimately, a book that an author takes five or ten years to write, through diligent research and painstaking reflection, makes for a much more satisfying and enriching read.  This is just not that book.  The prolific Ferguson hastily hammered this out in a year or two, with a pre-set agenda foreclosed to genuine reflection.  If the era of western dominance is indeed coming to an end, it will be at least partly attributable to the kind of willful oblivion, laziness and arrogance evinced by Ferguson in this work.intriguing contrast between North and South America, but it's hard not to be appalled by his blithe observation (and failure to wrestle with) the fact that \\"law\\" (and later, science) was viciously used as a rationalization to dislocate and exterminate native peoples.<br /><br />The worm really turns in the chapter on Medicine, much of which is comprised of documenting the ill treatment of Africans by European colonial powers, especially Germany.

B004ZNAXX2|5.0|Somewhat disappointed with the DSOTM Immersion set, no live concert footage of the album, opted for the Experience addition of WYWH, because, let's be honest, the Immersion set was very little additional content for 5 times the price. After all, I can see the animated \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" clip on You Tube. But I was really excited about The Wall Immersion Set, and wasn't disappointed. This one really has some teeth to it, as far as extra content goes, that is if you really like Pink Floyd and want to hear it.<br /><br />Disk 1 & 2 were the 2011 re-masters. To be honest, I can't tell the difference. I've read a lot of reviews about the re-master that complained about the volume level, and I agree they could have turned it up a lot. I thought that was the reason for re-masters, to get a crisper, cleaner sound at a higher level. I still have to crank this one, then when I shuffle into another song on another album, my ear drums blow out. Believe me, I didn't give this 5 Stars for the re-master, and I was so hoping this would be a great re-master.<br /><br />Disk 3 & 4 were re-masters of \\"Is Anybody out There\\", the original wall concert released in 2000. If you don't already have the album, it's worth having. If you do have it, this re-master doesn't make the Immersion set worth buying. It's kind of like, \\"okay, I have another copy of this, in case I lose the other one.\\"<br /><br />So I kinda blew off over 50% of this box set, as a so what, so why did I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Well, it's the two disks of bonus material. There is a lot of really good material here that you've never heard before, the antithesis of the DSOTM and WYWH box sets, and what they were missing. If you really want to hear the evolution of the great songs on this album, you get a really good taste of it. From Roger Waters home demos, (Short clips and wish they would have been longer) to David Gilmour's original Demo of the Music which became \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\". Even in these earliest Demos you can defiantly here where Roger was going with this stuff and why Gilmour's contribution to the Album was more then what he is given credit for. The band demos are great too, as you here how the songs developed. \\"Teacher, Teacher\\" which ended up on The Final Cut with revamped lyrics and \\"Sexual Revolution\\" which ended up on Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking were outtakes from the original demos. Some of these band demos actually are fun to listen to as well as being educational. I am so happy they released these, however, if you are not a big Floyd fan, you may find some of this stuff tedious.<br /><br />The disk of video material, though still sparse in my estimation, is much better than the other two Immersion sets. There is about 75 plus minutes of material here, most of which is the Behind the Wall documentary, which I've seen before but don't have on a DVD. Also, one cut \\"The Happiest Days of our Lives\\" from the original wall concert, which was really enjoyable to watch, though it left me wanting for more of it. The Gerald Scarfe Interview was decent, and overall, this was a good video disk. To the band, please release the wall concert video. You apparently have the material.<br /><br />Overall, this is what an Immersion set should be. You shouldn't be able to digest everything in one sitting, and the extra material should be stuff you've never heard before. It will take awhile to get through this one.

1451648537|4.0|Learning from a conflicted genius<br /><br />One of the great things about reading and reviewing the life of someone is what has been called \\"passive mentoring.\\"  This means learning for one's life from the experiences of others.  That is can be experienced in this bio of Steve Jobs.  This review would be too long to deal with all that one can learn from what I would call a \\"conflicted genius\\" but here are a few.<br /><br />From a positive point of view one would learn the value of simplicity as one stated about Jobs, \\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication\\" (80).  Linked with this would be his concern for excellence more than financial profit (passim & 569). Then there would be his great sense of creativity as seen throughout the life of Jobs and emphasized in this book. Although negative from one point of view, Jobs was able to get people \\"to do things they never dreamed possible\\" (565). And last but not least was his ability to focus (337).<br /><br />From a negative point of view one sees in this biography the \\"binary\\" nature of Jobs who could be so down on something and then suddenly change to thinking it was great. His lack of an understanding of how positive change could occur in his life seen in his declaration \\"This is who I am, and you can't expect me to be someone I am not\\" (565).  Isaacson, the author of this bio states in reply to this, \\"But I think he actually could have controlled himself, if he had wanted\\" (565). Then one last trait that needs to be pointed out was the restlessness seen in his life as evidenced again and again in his conflict with others when he collided with others again and again.<br /><br />So the advised reader will learn from these two sides of the life of Steve Jobs.
0141182504|5.0|This 1942 classic is about a man, Meursault, who shoots an Arab eight times without premeditation because he, Meursault, is overcome by the heat of the Algerian sun. He is unable to explain what he did and is sentenced to death.<br /><br />The book received many interpretations, including it being (1) a psychological exploration of Meursault's mind, a mind developed during an unfavorable upbringing, (2) a thriller portraying an existential philosophy, and (3) as Camus himself claims, Meursault is a man who is \\"condemned because he doesn't play the game. In this sense, he is an outsider to the society in which he lives, wandering on the fringe, on the outskirt of life, solitary and sensual.\\" By \\"playing the game,\\" Camus means inventing reasons for one's thoughts and behaviors, even life itself, which are untrue, because people really don't know why they act as they do and what is the meaning of life; so they invent conventions and values that are not related to reality or how they really feel. But Meursault insists upon being honest, doing and saying only what he knows to be true, not what people want or need to hear. Thus, despite the conventional requirement to cry at his mother's funeral or show regret for killing a man, he doesn't display these emotions because he doesn't feel them.<br /><br />Thus, Camus is dramatizing the idea of the \\"absurdity of life,\\" that life has no known meaning; people are unable to discover the true purpose and design of anything, and the explanations they give may make them feel good, but are not true. People insist on living a life ruled by the laws of morality, of \\"right\\" and \\"wrong.\\" But Meursault rejects morality and lives a life based on \\"truth.\\"<br /><br /> Camus, of course, was not the first to notice that people are unable to know life's purpose. Many others said this long before him. The ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus, for example, tells of the futility of life: a man is punished by the gods by needing to push a huge bolder up a steep hill daily, but after the bolder reaches the top, it rolls back down. The fourth century BCE Greek philosopher Plato told about human ignorance in his parable of people living in dark caves, unable to see the light of the sun. The author of the biblical book Ecclesiastes mentions all of the activities that people think are meaningful and calls them \\"vanity,\\" using a Hebrew word havel, which literally means a puff of air. The book ends with advice to stop searching and just do what God orders to be done. Similarly, the author of the biblical book Job describes Job and his friends trying unsuccessfully to explain why bad things happen to good people and concludes with God's voice appearing to Job within a stormy whirlwind and telling him that his concept that the world functions according to the rules of morality is a fiction; the world functions with violence according to God's unknown plans where animals tear one another to eat, where innocent children die, where good men and women suffer.<br /><br />In his The Myth of Sisyphus, Albert Camus offers four solutions for people who recognize the absurdity of life. The first takes Don Juan as an example: reject the notions of sin, damnation, and salvation, and seek the enjoyment of sex and other sensations. The second uses the actor as a paradigm: seek to enjoy every role you play with intensity as you encounter new people and experiences. The third looks at the conqueror: know that conquests are impermanent, but enjoy the pleasure of the quests. The last is the creative artist who knows that he can't change the world, but enjoy what he can do. In short, an intelligent person who sees the absurdity of life seeks what pleasures he can obtain while he is alive, without feeling guilt.<br /><br />Victor Frankl describes it best in his Search for Meaning, his description of horrendous and purposeless life in a Nazi concentration camp. He discovered that people can keep themselves alive if they have a sense of meaning. His hope to reunite with his wife kept him alive during his incarceration even though he didn't know that she was already dead. Thus, although life is absurd, each person should find their own meaning, purpose, and enjoyment in life, even if it is unrelated to reality and untrue.. His hope to reunite with his wife kept him alive during his incarceration even though he didn't know that she was already dead. Thus, although life is absurd, each person should find their own meaning, purpose, and enjoyment in life, even if it is unrelated to reality and untrue.

B005CMSDLE|4.0|HANNA is a great example of a film where style and attitude trumps (or nearly) substance and logic. It's a super-cool looking movie that feels like it is better than it really is.<br /><br />Young Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, THE LOVELY BONES) gives an MVP performance as a teen-age killer. Raised since she was a baby by Erik (Eric Bana) her father in the middle of what looks like northern Finland...she knows almost nothing of how life works in the civilized world. Growing up in a wild, snow-shrouded environ, Erik has taught her everything she needs to know about hand-to-hand combat, firearms, bows & arrows, etc., as well as given her an education in languages and practically encouraged her to memorize an encyclopedia. Erik, you see, is a former CIA agent who is on the run from his bosses, because he \\"knows too much\\" about some nefarious and unsavory program. He's raising Hanna to be able to survive on her own, because one day, he knows they'll be separated and she needs to be prepared to fight her way to freedom.<br /><br />That day comes when Hanna insists she's ready to live in the real world. So Erik pulls out a homing beacon that basically tells his pursuers exactly where to find him and when they show up, Erik has already fled, but Hanna turns herself over to them. It's never explained why they feel they must take such a loud, noisy, bloody re-entry into society...except that apparently it's worth risking both their lives to try to kill Erik's former boss/handler, Marissa (Cate Blanchett).<br /><br />Hanna DOES escape, in grand style, and begins her journey to reunite with her father. Along the way, she is befriended by various colorful \\"ordinary\\" people and we see how ill-prepared Hanna is to interact with society. She's smart & dangerous, but also touchingly helpless and naïve. She is pursued by some nasty characters (this movie does NOT make Germans or Germany look very appealing) as she flees from Morocco to Berlin.<br /><br />A few folks have compared Ronanto the killer girl played by Chloe Grace-Moretz in KICK-A**...but they similarities are very slender. Moretz was a fast -and-foul talking little sparkplug, world-wise and eager to pile up bodies. Hanna is slow to speech and is wild-eyed and wondering at the world.<br /><br />This is Ronan's movie and she totally steals it. She is a totally striking figure, in her nearly white hair and white eyebrows, with piercing eyes. But she continues to amaze as an actress as well...totally convincing as a killer, but also believable as just a teenager who has led a sheltered life. This character is very interesting & engaging, and we root for her.<br /><br />Bana is fairly bland, but the role is bland. Blanchett is over-the-top, and proves once and for all (after INDIANA JONES) that she is NOT cut out to play a cartoonish villainess. She puts on a terrible Southern accent and gives a performance utterly without menace. I normally love her, but she was quite terrible in HANNA. (I did enjoy Tom Hollander as the primary assassin chasing Hanna. He brought a convincing level of creepiness to his performance.)<br /><br />Director Joe Wright uses his exotic locations well and stages some nifty little action scenes. There are a lot of shots of Hanna simply running with great urgency, but they reminded me of Franka Potente in RUN LOLA RUN...gripping in their simplicity.<br /><br />But behind the style, I found a frustrating plot. Motivations were often sketchy. Characters behaved in ways that didn't entirely make sense. The bad guys seemed more adept at crossing the globe than was reasonable. And this is one of those films where MANY innocent people die so that just two people can live. Hanna and her father are not important enough to justify the deaths and torturing of so many others...especially folks who befriend Hanna only to die painfully later.<br /><br />And the climax of the film lacks punch. The best action sequences come early. I know the end is supposed to have more emotionalheft, but because we don't really care that much about the Blanchett & Bana, the lack of a really spectacular climactic chase or battle really left me with a deflated feeling when the credits began to roll.<br /><br />But the character of Hanna and the performance of Ronan make the movie worth seeing. She is a terrific young actress and has thoroughly embraced her untraditional character. I wouldn't even mind seeing another Hanna movie...keep the visual style and cool locations, but give Hanna some really interested characters to interact with.
160094048X|5.0|I'm not vegan so I'm a novice with some of the special ingredients.  That said, I started off with the recipes that used regular ingredients.  After success with 2 cookies I ventured out and bought the vegan chocolate chips and butter and shortening.  The first 5 recipes I've made have been perfect.  I posted 4 photos of beautiful results.  Peanut Butter Blondie (amazing), Whole Wheat Chocolate Chip Cookies (awesome, because I hate overly sweet or greasy cookies), Sweet Wine Biscuits (not my fav but still good), Sugar Cookies & the Cinnamon Sugar Cookie variation (look at the photo - sugar cookies have a classic look, while the cinnamon sugar cookies have a rustic look), and the Banana Everything Cookie (very good, I rolled some in crushed pretzels and both variations were great). I also made the Espresso Chip Oatmeal Cookies but I used carob chips which gave them a malt flavor so I will certainly not fault the authors when I didn't follow the recipe (no photo of this).  Love the look of the book also.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I have been disappointed by the writing in the latest book in this series. I am finding GRRM's style a bit more stodgy, stylized and predictable than in earlier volumes, but that is probably just having become very familiar. I find myself skipping more than in earlier volumes, because of obsessive detail. Often enough there is an original turn of phrase or usage to be stimulating.<br />The presentation of the magical and supernatural is interestingly at odds with the author's highly sceptical views. The predominant use of subjective narrative allows perceptions of such content without affirmation in any external reality, but many scenes have now become elaborately fantastical way beyond minor illusions..<br />A great strength that is largely maintained is the gritty and often witty dialogue of his characters. Perhaps we have become inured to GRRM's providing gruesome fates to lead characters, so by now we have learned not to be overattached or sentimental!<br />I am still so grateful for the literary exertion and accomplishment in this series that there is a reluctance to be critical. Still, one hopes for tidiness as the byzantine plots are resolved in the final volumes. And please, let's hope this happens before senility and death intervene in all the characters, the author or ourselves.<br /><br />The popularity will now be assured anyway by the TV series. Indeed it is a likelihood that an increasing proportion of readers will have watched the TV series before reading all or part of the books, and thus are not readers are not responding to the book as  literature but rather to a combined experience.

B0052U59F4|1.0|I purchased the book as I heard it reviewed on a TV news program. Normally, I don't waste my time on fluff, but thought this might be the exception. It rests solely on descriptions of unspeakable depravity without believable plot line running through it. The ending was no ending at all--only beconing the weak to further waste of time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the book but not as well as the first two. I can't define it but the ending left me wanting something more.
014062029X|4.0|The Mayor of Casterbridge isn't really about a man who sells his wife and daughter. Yes, that is part of it, but 80% of the story has little to do with that fact. In actuality, it is about relationships, and the choices we make that can have an impact on those we love. The story twists and turns, and weaves several different characters' stories into one neat ending, but can be predictable at times.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed the book, but it can be slow and predictable at times, as I already mentioned.

B001CDWFPC|5.0|The ESV Study Bible has been most helpful in my reading of God's Word. The Electronic Version is well set out, although for an oldie like me it is difficult to navigate around.

B0052U59F4|2.0|I was enjoying this book until I learned that it's part of a trilogy. Two words -- no way. The characters are not interesting enough to see me through two more books. And, as others have pointed out, the main character says the same few things over and over again. It grew tiresome and had me wondering if her editor was on vacation throughout the publication process.<br /><br />I was mildly curious to find out what made Christian the way he is but not enough to sit and read two more books full of banalities. I'm sorry. I just can't.

This kit turns an old 20$ flashlight into a new 50$ tactical flashlight. Buy it, you won't regret it.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|As someone who studies infectious diseases like flu for a living, this movie was a long time coming. As good as Hollywood is likely to get as far as a 'realistic' portrayal of a pandemic. Certainly much more realistic than 'Outbreak'. I have minor quibbles with the rate of spread of the disease as well as the relative ease and speed with which a vaccine is developed, manufactured and used. But it's nothing like the liters and liters of antisera that Dustin Hoffman gets out of one little tiny monkey in a matter of minutes in 'Outbreak'.<br /><br />Was it a possible candidate for Best Picture? No. As others have noted, the film has a decided lack of focus which makes it more difficult to care about the characters as much as you might like. In trying to portray all aspects of the pandemic, it reaches for more than it should. It might have been better served to focus on one story (ala Legend or Walking Dead) and leave the rest alone. And I don't think it would have mattered which one - Matt Damon's story was certainly foremost but the others were potentially interesting. Esp. Marion Cotillard tracking down the spread of the disease from Hong Kong and being taken hostage. As previously mentioned, the spread is too fast and the vaccine developed too fast to be entirely realistic. The speed with which time passes is also difficult to grasp and at times weeks or months appear to have passed but to the viewer it feels like hours or maybe days. And it's obvious the producers realized this and that's why they added the handy time scale in text at times although it still doesn't help with the disorientation.<br /><br />Not that there aren't aspects to like. Jude Law's unscrupulous blogger hits all to close to home with today's 'blogosphere' which seems to have an 'anything goes' mentality. Gweneth Paltrow's cheating wife gets her 'reward'. Not exactly 'Fatal Attraction' but still...

B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe is simply the best show on TV right now. Period. It's getting awfully close to one of the best shows (ever) for me. Yes, it's that good. And season 3 is arguably the best season.<br /><br />What's to like? You get to see both universes. You get to see Anna Torv and John Noble play both their characters in our universe and their alternates in the other universe. And these aren't 'slight' variations of the characters, these are full-blown characters in their own right with different personalities from their dopplegangers in our universe. And it's not black and white, we can see the complexities and it's not simple to declare who the good guys and bad guys are although Walternate comes closest to being the bad guy. At least, until you see Season 4...<br /><br />Simply put - this show is a tour-de-force and absolutely mind-blowing at times. It is a crime that more people aren't watching it.<br /><br />You could make a case for season 1 (where things were still hidden) and season 2 (where the inter-dimensional war become fully out in the open and secrets were revealed) being better and I'd be hard pressed to argue. I doubt many would argue that the current season 4 is the best but then again with 8 episodes left who knows what the writers will pull on us. I still remember the season 1 finale when Olivia ended up in the alternate universe for the first time and we saw Kennedy was still alive and the World Trade Center towers were still standing...

0307959856|2.0|I suppose a woman of PD James' longevity and success can do just about anything she pleases at this point in her life. But I'm disappointed that, rather than creating a new Dalgliesh novel, she chose to write a Jane Austen wannabe sequel instead.<br /><br />There is already a glut of Austen knock-offs, from a twee series in which Jane Austen herself solves mysteries, to zombie and sea-monster versions. We really don't need this book.<br /><br />In addition, James assumes that her readers are as knee-deep in Austen as she obviously is. I have read all of the Austen novels and seen most of the recent film adaptations, but I don't have the full character list in the front of my brain, along with a photographic recollection of all the sub-characters and sub-plots of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. So I spent a lot of the book trying to recall who the various people were. Rabid Austen fans will not have this problem.<br /><br />The other main problem with this book is that the mystery is boring. The murder takes place at the beginning of the book, then there's loads and loads of fodder for Austen-lovers until the finale, which falls with a dull thud. There's no real investigation to speak of, at least the type we are used to from PDJ. So in summary, this obviously was a labor of love for the author, who greatly admires Austen. But for many PDJ fans, it will be a big disappointment, as we wait and wonder if the author will complete another book at age 92.

B004GFN11A|5.0|I'm not gonna get into a long description of what a dumbass I was, but suffice it to say, when I needed it most, the [[ASIN:B004GFN11A WordPress]] app for the Amazon Kindle Fire and other Android devices saved me of even more humiliation than I would normally encounter after posting a blog story, realizing an egregious typo or two...or three, and then finding myself without access to my home computer or laptop with which to edit them.<br /><br />Such a circumstance happened to me recently, when someone emailed to \\"inform me\\" of how badly I'd screwed up. I was on a weekend trip to another city and only had access to my Kindle Fire (actually, I HAD brought my laptop with me, but as luck would have it, its power supply went bad en route and took the battery with it). When I received the email on my Kindle (which I'm learning to love more each day), my laptop was toast and I thought I was too, as we wouldn't be returning home for another more two days.<br /><br />Luckily, I realized that I'd recently downloaded the WordPress app, but hadn't yet had any reason to use it. I quickly corrected the typos (and let's just say, they weren't punctuation or common-word based errors, either). So at least I was able to save *part* of my face (and the jury's still out on whether or not that's actually a good thing...); all thanks to my Kindle Fire and the WordPress app, available for free from the Amazon AppStore.<br /><br />It's easy to use, and when ya need it. well, ya really need it.
0307742539|5.0|Of what use is one more review among the 1000+ that already exist? Well, I have a couple of unique points. This book/series/character/author is deservedly well-loved, as all three books were beyond readable. With massive casts of characters who all had similar sounding Swedish names, one nonetheless zeroes in on an emotional connection to each of the main players. I bought the mass market paperback last tuesday, and I finisehd it last night, Sunday (roughly 160 words per day). I've seen all four movies. I thought the 2nd book and 2nd movie were the weakest, but that's because of how much I hate Zalachenko. The more he's off-canvas or dead, the better for me. Neidermann is far more interesting, mostly because he's just as bizarre, in his way, as Lisbeth. If only we could ever find out Camilla's deal as well. It's so tragic that the trilogy is the total of Larsson's legacy, but what a monument they comprise.<br /><br />Anyway, my two points, one technical, the other political (and with spoilers, though the hardbackk has been out for three years):<br /><br />1. This paperback doesn't really fit with the first two, as it's become taller and narrower. That's sort of annoying, an industry change that reflects just how long they waited before finally releasing paperbacks. It's also $2 more than the previous two volumes, also kind of annoying. At least the font and cover dress matches, but it looks odd on the shelf.<br /><br />2. Wanting to see more Lisbeth is beside the point in this volume. She's either near-death or incarcerated for the majority of this book, and there's no way she can be anything else, after the apocalypse of the 2nd volume. Her agents have to be elsewhere and others, because she has no mobility, either physically or legally. Doesn't mean the many scenes of alliances she forms, with nurses, doctors, janitors and over the internet (once she has her smart phone) aren't important, including the contentious one with her lawyer, Blomqvist's sister Annika.<br /><br />a. If the book isn't only about Lisbeth, that's because it's about women in general. Remember the original title of volume one, and the disgusting reality of Martin Vanger's life. He's mentioned once in this book, but his presence is still felt. All of the major players of \\"The Section\\" are corrupt men ... there isn't a woman in their midst who isn't a secretary. But look at the other women in the book:<br /><br />b. Policewoman Figuerola: stronger and more imposing than most men, beautiful and confident and addicted to working out; Lindner: too enraged to be a good cop, endlessly brave as a bodyguard to targeted women; Annika, unwilling to concede to Kalle or Lisbeth's terms, but able to take on imposing authority figures to their shock and arrogance; Erika, facing a losing battle in her new job as the newspaper industry goes through downsizing shocks, targeted by a colleague not for business reasons, but for a high school slight only he remembers; Modig, struggling for respect amongst her colleagues just like Jane Tennison; and worst of all the two tragic students locked up to die in Zalachenko's factory, then killed by Neidermann after all, perfunctorily. They all have to deal with threats coming from men.<br /><br />c. Lisbeth is just another victim, as even Eckstrom realizes at the end (in his one moment of insight), and also the strongest one of all because she gets her revenge without budging an inch on her principles. The truest moment of the American film comes near the end, when she rescues Mikael from Vanger's lair and asks permission to take him out. All \\"Kalle\\" can do is nod./><br />a.

B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Clearly, not a film for everyone. From beginning to end, the story unfolds at its own pace. If you're just just looking for a \\"movie for guys, who like movies\\" with rapid-fire action sequences, then be forewarned that this isn't a \\"Fast and the Furious,\\" \\"Shoot 'Em Up,\\" or Van Damme-type non-stop, adrenaline-pumped action flic. It doesn't fit neatly into either the action or the drama genre. Definitely a cult classic, though. Some driving scenes. No gun battles or high-speed, explosive car chases, but cleverly done, none the less. Some gruesome kill scenes, without a rain of bullets or extended hand-to-hand combat scenes. Best to know what to expect. If you don't like full-frontal, horrific kill scenes, skip this one. It's not that there's too many. It's part of the story. Don't bother asking why the \\"The Kid\\" did it that way. It's a kill or be killed scenario. Think fast. Use what's available at hand RIGHT NOW or die. As to the scene in the elevator that ends with Irene standing in the parking garage, looking back at him, I understand his rage in that elevator scene -- it was for everything that he almost had, everything that might have been, everything that he will never have, hence the raw brutality in his actions with her baring full witness. There's a quiet, unique \\"romance\\" between Irene (Mulligan), & \\"The Kid\\" (Gosling), but no steamy sex scenes. If you need romantic leads to verbally declare their intentions, spell out their past lives, future dreams, & emotions thru dialogue, you'll be sorely disappointed. Drive is NOT diaglogue-driven.  Irene & \\"The Kid's\\" lives are simple, & their feelings for each other are pure & simple. No on-screen declarations. It's called ACTING. Everything is conveyed through scant dialogue. Irene's young son is only part of the attraction between them. You'll need to understand what's not said, and pay attention to their multi-layered, nuanced emotions conveyed thru body language, facial expressions, & time spent together in a few, frugal scenes. We loved Gosling's intensity throughout. It drew us in & kept us riveted. The acting held us there, not dialogue or requisite love scenes. We don't need to know \\"The Kid's\\" name, his history, where he came from, or what made him that way. It's not relevant to the story that played out before us, which relied on the connection between Irene & \\"The Kid\\" to drive the movie to its final conclusion. Gosling reeled us in & convinced us of every intention thru his posture, the grit of his jaw, & that fleeting glint in his eyes that alternately conveyed tenderness, & unmistakable, dangerous resolve. He doesn't represent \\"every man.\\" Most people will never meet anyone like him. You can't know him. You don't get to know him. He never revealed anything. That's the whole point and the beauty of it, because he made us understand what drove him. It was all done in the name of protecting what he had come to love. We've always been Gosling fans, & this only served to solidify his talent. If you liked \\"Lars and the Real Girl,\\" you'll like this more, though there's no similarity between \\"Lars\\" & \\"The Kid's\\" characters -- the similarity lies in Gosling's uncanny ability to fully inhabit the role of his character. Would've given it 5 stars, but we just saw Jeong-beom Lee's \\"The Man from Nowhere,\\" which set the bar very high.

B00509898G|2.0|Fight Club the book is similar in style to the movie; strange and enigmatic. The storyline is virtually identical to the movie, which shows how faithfully the movie followed the book.  Unfortunately, the book was not very compelling to read and the strangeness became tedious after a while.  If you have not seen the movie, the book may be a revelation.  However, if you have seen the movie, the characters may appear crudely drawn.

075640407X|1.0|I didn't finish this book. What I did read seemed like 15 chapters of filler. The author has apparantly never met a metaphor or simile he didn't like for they are well over used. Some I think he even made up, poorly though. A good story should pull the reader into it, bring the characters to life. This book did not. It seemed to get bogged down in minor details. Very descriptive to the point of being overly so.  I wish I could have given it negative stars.

B0052U59F4|5.0|I heard about this book on the 'Today' show and needless to say it piqued my interest.  I bought it on Friday and started reading it Friday evening.  Well, I stayed up till 6:30 in the morning to finish the book.  I couldn't stop reading it and I didn't want to stop.  And I bought the other two books right away.  With a combine sleep of about 5 hours from Friday to Sunday, I knew I wouldn't make it to work on Monday.  Yeah I took the day off to finish reading the third instalment.<br /><br />I laughed a lot but I cried a lot too through the entire trilogy.  I am a sucker for happy endings and I just wanted to finish the last book to know if it would be a happy ending.  The books have really HOT, SEXY scenes.  Yes some disturbing parts are in the book, but to be honest I could see nothing beyond the Love Story between the awesome, complicated and lovable Christian and the brave and innocent Anastasia.  I couldn't get enough of Christian, he just resonated to me.  I read a lot of books and I've read many romance books, but no character has ever affected me as much as Christian.  I think he'll stay with me for a while.  What woman wouldn't want a man who completely adores, cherishes, and loves her and has her as the center of his universe.  Yes he was a bit possessive and irrational but again all I could see was the Love.<br /><br />I LOVED the books, especially the emails between Christian and Anastasia.  It was so different and showed their relationship blossom (yes I'm a complete, hopeless romantic). I recommend the entire trilogy and I can't wait to read what the author writes about next.  Although, I wouldn't mind reading more about Christian Grey.

Im pretty upset that you guys listed it as saying a box set. So i would love to hear back from you guys on why this was sent to me like that.

B005VOMX14|5.0|For those upset with the Best Of Wham, The Final is the one to get.<br /><br />The CD<br /><br />All the hits and singles are here except for Club Fantastic Megamix. Apparently Wham! did not approve of this.<br /><br />You get improved versions of some songs.<br />*Last Christmas (pudding mix). I really like the ending where George goes la la la with the synthesizer bit.<br />*Everything She Wants (remix). This sounds miles better than the original album version.<br />*Young Guns is also different from the album version.<br /><br />The DVD<br /><br />All the videos are here and in chronological order. So you can see the evolution of Wham!<br /><br />Highlights include<br />* Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)<br />The video features a different rap from the album version.<br /><br />*Young Guns (Go For It!)<br />This looks like it was recorded from a VHS tape. You can see the lines across the screen. Some parts are pretty fuzzy. Maybe that's why it was not on The Best Of Wham! DVD. Nonetheless, it's great to have it on this set. It''s still a highly enjoyable video.<br /><br />*There's Bad Boys, Careless Whisper, Last Christmas and lots more...<br /><br />I had a fantastic 80s retro blast with this and I'm sure you will too!

This book gives you a glimpse of how such epic tragedy came to be.  We peer through darkened glass at the death throes of this nightmare government.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book is not sexy spy novel or a thrilling tale of war and heroism, and that is why it is so great.  It is a refreshingly honest look at how someone finds their way into the military service, how it changes them, and how it wrecks havoc with their family.  It is also a visceral and unfiltered look at the realities of patriotism and warfare.  This book has all the elements of a hollywood summer blockbuster with death defying scenarios and action, but it is told as if by the author himself, over beers at a local bar.  Great stuff.

B001FVD65O|4.0|Bruce Willis returns to the role that made him a star, with Samuel L. Jackson along for the ride as his unwitting new partner. A furious ticking time bomb (both literally and metaphorically), it's nearly on the same level as the original with wall-to-wall action and one high-pressure twist after another. Jackson and Willis are masters of the action set, playing up the tension while easily building a great dynamic together, and the film keeps enough ginormous obstacles around to maintain a dead sprint for the full two hours. Large, loud and ludicrous, it's still loads of fun after all this time.

B00003CXDD|3.0|I hadn't seen this in almost twenty years, and that's probably for the best. Since it's very clearly postured as a children's movie, I can't dock too many points if it's overly silly, hokey and naive, but I do suddenly feel quite sorry for dragging my folks out to see it all those summers ago. Simply put, it's not one of those kid's movies that parents will be surprised to enjoy just as much as their little ones. Val Kilmer and Warwick Davis have a strange sort of charm that manages to shine through the wooden dialog and dated special effects, and the plot has the optimistic, adventurous core of a classic fairy tale, so it's not like there's a total lack of positives. But it also borrows heavily from Tolkien, paling badly by comparison, and it pushes the limits of suspended disbelief too far on more than one occasion. George Lucas's influence is all over the screen, too, from the excessively playful tone to the heavy-handed wipe transitions and stiff, over-proper repartee. If you've ever wondered what a Hobbit might look like on Middle Earth, this is your ticket.

1401307957|5.0|I have fretted all my life about not catching the magic...I run two small illustration businesses and have loads of fine art commissions...so far so good, no? No. It was never enough. I was never catching the special thing. The Special Thing. Well, I was, but only ever by accident. Then my mum sent me Danny's book for my birthday. Even the kids stopped talking when I began to read it out loud. Then I started sketching every day. Danny says it's not the result that matters. So I took him at his word and just took my pen for a walk. That was nearly a month ago. Now my drawing is better than it's ever been, and that's all I care about (ok, I care about selling it too). Not alone am I sketching every day but I am really happy. I suspected that drawing as I was always meant to draw would give me that happiness. And it is so...my friends and family can't believe the breakthrough and keep asking me what happened. I keep saying, I told you, it's Danny Gregory's book.<br /><br />Thank you, man.
067960085X|5.0|Aww! I already listed another book as officially the greatest book of all time. I guess if I said that about this it really would be hyperbole but it's tempting. What a great book! What a great character is Holly Golightly! She's so real, so unpredictable, so sad in many ways. I think of her stealing chickens to feed herself and her brother as a child in the backwoods. And certainly this book was done to perfection in movie form with the absolute pitch choice of Audrey Hepburn to play Holly.[[ASIN:B000I3UMKM Breakfast at Tiffany's]]<br /> Do readers know this today? How great this movie and book is? I sometimes feel it is my duty to tell them, because after all this book was written a while ago, and all anyone ever talks about when it comes to Capote was that gruesome work he did called \\"In Cold Blood.\\" Trust me, this book is nothing like that depressing tour of morbidity. http://www.amazon.com/Anthea-Carson/e/B002CE0WAU/ref=ntt_dp_epwbk_0

1613822286|5.0|It's one thing to have authored several books.  It's quite another to have other authors write about the author of those novels.  This is the case with Thackeray.  His style of writing is both smart and humorous and several books have been written about his style, and for good reason.<br /><br />Getting through over 1,000 pages of a novel written in 19th Century British English can certainly be a challenge, and you probably won't breeze through Vanity Fair, but if you do take the time to get through it, you will be richly rewarded.  William Makepeace Thackeray's sense of humor in satirizing the upper classes of England at the time comes through strongly and his vivid details bring both the characters and locations come alive.<br /><br />Join the two lead characters, Rebecca and Amelia, as Thackeray chronicles their lives from their earliest years at Ms Pinkerton's Academy for Young Ladies to old age.  Their stories take them to varied locations looking for different relationships and dreams of a different type.  In following them on their journeys, Thackeray utilizes his keen knowledge of the times and locations to life with richly textured descriptions.  More interesting, however, is his use of satire to show how happiness, sadness, back-stabbing, and both good and bad relationships aren't affected by society or class.  There is no magic formula for living the ideal life and both Becky and Amelia find out the hard way that life can be both challenging and rewarding.<br /><br />Take a leap into this perilous journey through drama, romance, action, comedy and historical-based fiction and you won't be sorry.  Enjoy!

B006ZS81GG|5.0|I usually don't write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after listening to this album front to back three times without being able to get enough of it.  Each song had me begging for more and after the last, I was disappointed that it was over.  Lana Del Rey is what I would describe to be sort of a mixture of lamenting 50's folk gone trip hop'ish.  I think we would all agree that Lana Del Rey's voice is perfect for this type of music, but I would go further and argue that her song writing ability rivals that of legendary artists like Elton John.  So far our favorite song on this album is \\"Off To The Races\\", if not only for the brilliantly poetic content of the lyrics.  Lana tells a complex and rich story in a very short amount of lines.<br /><br />I can't wait to listen to it again.  My only worry is that Lana Del Rey will not be able to match this brilliant debut in the future.  I told my girlfriend that I had no idea how Lana was going to possibly be able to follow this album up in the future, being that I can't imagine it being any better.<br /><br />If Lana Del Rey doesn't absolutely crush the Grammy Awards next year with this album, it will be an atrocity.

What a ride, I will DEFINITLY be buying ANYTHING this write puts out!
B005UKJX4E|4.0|The Tree of Life ironically deals with the topic of death. The film tells you to turn up the sound so you can hear all the first person narration. When their son dies at the age of 19 parents cope with the loss and question their faith, but not severely question their faith that would alter their life style. After the characters are introduced, we still see Sean Penn doesn't own a comb. The film digresses into a Discovery Channel special which condenses the modern version of creation of 14.7 billion years into about 12 minutes. I felt like we had passed into the monolith.<br /><br />We now start all over with the birth of the children. Hey, we already know one dies. There are things that are whispered. These are meant to be ideas or questions for God. Brad Pitt metaphorically represents the \\"tough love\\" God who prepares us for life's journey without us realizing it. Hence we have the macrocosm and microcosm in our tale. One could assume that the microcosm of our life is reflective of our theological views, we carve out a tough love God based upon our tough love \\"Father\\". At one point in the movie Brad Pitt insists his son call him \\"Father\\" and never \\"Dad.\\" Having lived in the south, that is a no-no. \\"Father\\" is reserved for the heavenly Father. That is a hint of the symbolism. A sermon stresses the book of Job and asks, \\"Is the scheme of life a fraud?\\"<br /><br />Not for everyone. I was very bored until I figured out what they were attempting to do. I think the beauty of the film is that different people can grasp a different meaning from it. It doesn't spell it out. My review is one take.

006197806X|5.0|While waiting for my copy of Pandemonium to arrive I continuously saw reviews that highlighted phrases like \\"even better than Delirium\\" and I laughed. Better than Delirium, ha, no such thing. I am elated to announce that I Carole McKenzie, was wrong.<br /><br />Pandemonium is thrilling, captivating, and everything a sequel should be. Thank you Lauren Oliver for creating a series for me to lose sleep over. Thank you for creating a sequel that is so brilliant I need the next book right now before I lose my mind. Oh my, am I going to lose my mind!<br /><br />In Pandemonium we follow Lena through then and now. The then being when she crossed over into the Wilds and now being the present. Each chapter goes back and forth and Lauren Oliver knows where to stop and start each new tale in a way that is perfect. Lena's story is powerful, meaningful, and amazing.<br /><br />The end literally stole my breath away and gave me what felt like a heart attack. This is no little cliffhanger, it is the mother of all cliffhangers. I cried at the end, cried!<br /><br />I will say no more because if you read Delirium you've probably already read Pandemonium or it's sitting on your bookshelf crying for attention. And if you haven't read Delirium I hope i have convinced you to give it a chance, because this series is not one to skip over.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard all of the hype surrounding these books and decided to try it out. I am glad I did. I went through the whole trilogy in a week and had it not been for school and work, it would have taken far less time. I HIGHLY recommend.
0061997811|5.0|From a graphics designer POV this book is ideal as reference for the re-use chick look-and-feel. I got a used like-new copy and it's great! Granted the corners are a bit scratched, the pages are in great shape and from what I can tell the pop-outs and secret additional inserts are all there. Great book for any HP fan regardless of age, but I can argue that its better for the older fans due to the content reading level and the amazing details. Love it!
B004W89N72|1.0|First, the description implies that it syncs with &quot;[my] Android device's calendar.&quot; It doesn't. It is a stand-alone calendar and that makes it worse than the stock calendar.<br /><br />Second, if this calendar syncs with nothing at all, WHY DOES IT NEED FULL INTERNET ACCESS?!?! That is a completely unnecessary permission. Do. Not. Download. And if you have, I would highly recommend you uninstall immediately.

B0077DBZXO|2.0|As others have mentioned (and I ignored) this movie is boring.<br />Not up to the 'Shrek' movies standards. This movie does not draw you in so that you care what happens to any of the characters. Though full of action it goes no where & you are left feeling you just wasted your money & more importantly your time.
630522577X|4.0|I first saw My Fair Lady as a child and was inspired by the story throughout the years. I realize that many people take the story on different levels and my perspective is probably a little \\"out of the box,\\" but essentially what I got out it of it is that it doesn't matter what environment or education you were born into. You can transform yourself into anybody or anything you want if you put your mind to it.

My favorite read so far this year.
B004S49YVU|4.0|Good spy novel.  Lots of twists.  I had already read the next book in the trilogy and reading this one - it now all makes sense.

1597801585|2.0|Imagine, if you will, that a novel is a story being acted out somewhere and the novelist is a guy running alongside with a video camera capturing the action for the narrative. Bacigalupi was doing a great job of capturing the ambiance of a futuristic Bangkok in what is vaguely a Cyberpunk/Steampunk/Dystopian novel. However, after setting a nice scene in the opening third, he quickly got bored with following his main characters and took a random side-street to go film someone else instead. Then a little further on, he ran into another character who for a few chapters took his fancy, and his focus, away from the plot. Then in a frantic scramble, he tried to tie it up at the end but then apparently ran out of video tape. Slamming a new cassette into his camera, he concluded to cram a conclusion and 20% of the overall plot into a final hashed out \\"Epilogue\\" chapter.<br /><br />Being a fan of Cyberpunk, Steampunk, post-Modernism and dystopian fiction, I had high hopes for this novel. It lacked direction and having finished the novel this morning, I still don't really know what it was about or what message Bacigalupi was trying to put over. The over-obvious Blade Runner references (replicants, the question of \\"how human is human?\\" and built in countermeasures to protect humanity) are too blatantly ripped off. He even has the Windup Girl of the title turning into Tolkien's Smeagol/Gollum for one scene which simply made me laugh in disbelief.<br /><br />Nice concept; nice use of a different, exotic, and interesting location (Bangkok), but sadly flawed and let down by its floundering.

B004FOA84A|2.0|This game was, in my opinion, much to short and not worth the money I paid for it. I feel as though I've been cheated. I do have to say it was clever and a tad challenging. However, I ended the game mere hours after I began and wanted more. Usually when I buy these types of games I take a couple of days to play it and get a sense of fulfillment when I'm done. This was most definitely not the case here.

B005UT29Z0|4.0|I really enjoyed the documentary \\"inside Job.\\"  It exposed much of the financial industry's debacle of 2008.  This film, Margin Call, is a  depiction of a fictional U.S. financial company and how they would have reacted to circumstances at that time, mirroring the greed and irresponsible behavior in this industry.  Food for thought...

B003O86FMW|5.0|This story was so captivating that I had to read it again. While the first installment of this series was entertaining, this was by far my favorite. The introduction of new characters and an even thicker plot line was riveting and made this story truly entertaining.<br /><br />A the end of The Hunger Games, the characters' futures seemed to be looking up. It even made me question what the second story would be about, but boy did things change. Katniss and Peeta are presented with all new challenges because, when trying to save their lives, they inadvertently created an uprising within the districts. It was interesting to see how Katniss, along with Peeta, tried to solve a problem they didn't even know they created. This seems like such a burden for a children to bear, yet they faced each stage head on. In this story, I really got to see Katniss step up and not only protect her sister but everyone else who she cares for no matter the consequences to herself.<br /><br />Peeta proved to me why he was my favorite character in the first story by being even better this time around. Katniss is really the one facing having to suffer the consequences of her and Peeta's actions. Yet Peeta still stands by her side even if their relationship is questionable at best.<br /><br />This story was another gut wrenching plot that left me in tears at times. The new characters introduced in this story far surpassed the supporting cast in The Hunger Games. Although, some of the previous favorites like Gale, Seneca, and Primrose make an appearance as well. New characters are introduced that make this story just plan enjoyable. The twists and turns the author came up with to challenge these characters was inspirational.<br /><br />You must read the first installment of this trilogy to truly appreciate this story. Trust me, you will want to read the first story as well as the second and the third. I originally read the series then I allowed my ten year old to read them. She asked me numerous times if she could re-read the series. She even finished reading Catching Fire in two days, that is how captivating it was. Do not mistake this as just a young adult novel either, anyone of any age can appreciate this book. So please pick it up today.<br /><br />Originally posted at LAS YA Reviewss times if she could re-read the series. She even finished reading Catching Fire in two days, that is how captivating it was.

0807014273|5.0|Man's Search for Meaning is a fantastic read.  Half of the book is about his struggles in concentration camps, but I particularly enjoyed the second half about logotherapy.  The idea that you can survive anything by keeping a will to live is a simple, yet extraordinary idea.  Frankl mentioned how the first people to die were the ones that had lost a purpose in their life.  They did not imagine a goal, and were left to die in the concentration camps.<br /><br />My favorite quote from the book is \\"Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now.\\"  In other words, do something wrong that you know how to do right.  You only have one life, don't waste it.  Obviously people don't always know what the best decision at every given moment, but this is about controlling that which you have control over.  Take advantage of the life you are giving, don't throw it away because there is always someone else who would do anything to have your life.<br /><br />Originally, I thought that this book applied only to the bigger issues in life; that it is about you life as a whole.  While that does seem to hold true, the idea of meaning can be applied to all aspect of one's life.  Whether it is something menial or something life threatening, having that goal or purpose leads to you putting forth a constant effort.  That effort can change someone's life, just like this book.

B0052U59F4|5.0|After I finished the sample for this book I had to know what was going on with Christian Grey! Oh boy, was I shocked! I have never read a BDSM novel before and I hardly knew anything about the topic. In fact, I almost deleted this book after reading Christian's contract. I have never been more grateful for my inability to not finish a book. Why did I keep reading after this novel had me blushing furiously and my jaw dropping? Because it's well-written.<br /><br />I was captivated from the start, even though it starts off a little slow - and I usually despise this. The author's writing style was unique. The \\"inner-goddess\\" and the back and forth emails between Anastasia and Christian had me chuckling. The email signatures are fantastic! \\"Twitchy Palms\\" is forever burned into my memory. Most of all, I love Anastasia Steele. Her character is innocent in a lot of ways, however, she is not weak. She is intelligent, snarky, witty, strong, patient...I could go on and on.<br /><br />Here's the kicker: I did not want to read the next book. There is something that happens toward the end of this novel that had me sobbing. I did not want to find out what happened next, at all. I despised Christian Grey. I wanted to be content with how this first book ended and create a HEA in my head for Ana, but I couldn't do it. I had to know. That's what good books are supposed to do - have you wondering what's next.<br /><br />I won't go into detail about the next two books in this series, but I will say that pretty quickly into Fifty Shades Darker, I grew to love Christian. E.L. James portrayed this dark story eloquently. This series is now one of my top two favorite stories.<br /><br />As a side note, I would like to offer my opinion on the complaints of this story originally being Twilight FanFiction. E.L. James is a fabulous writer. I am profoundly thankful that she decided to publish this story. Otherwise, I would never have come across it. I have read all the Twilight books (a couple times actually) and I have to say there are not many parallels. This story is original, no matter what the author's original inspiration. James is a talented author and deserves to be able to sell her work to the public.times actually) and I have to say there are not many parallels.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Over the four days since I purchased the Wool omnibus, I could not put it down.  This eerily believable tale sparks strong imagery reminiscent of Clarke and Asimov stories.<br /><br />To the author, thank you so very much for writing these incredible stories.  I look forward to enjoying your other books!

B0064NTZJO|1.0|Whoever said this movie was good must have been watching it without their glasses.  This movie was a COMPLETE WASTE of two hours.  Ryan Gosling's acting was good, but the plot and cadence of the storyline moved along at a snails pace. Kept expecting it to pick up but it never did and then it was over.  Thank goodness we only rented it!

B0052U59F4|5.0|OMG! really what more is there to say?<br /><br />I saw this book mentioned on the news but didn't get to watch the whole broadcast and so after reading the last new book on my kindle this weekend, I thought why not give it a shot.<br /><br />The story is touching, racy and beautiful...after two days of non-stop reading I finished the trilogy and I wasn't ready for it to end :(<br /><br />I am eagerly awaiting for E L James' next project!!
0439023513|2.0|I loved the first two books in the Hunger Games series. I was super excited when my friend let me borrow the third book after she finished reading it. I was extremely disappointed when I finished it. It took about 100 pages for me to even get into the last novel and then to my surprise the last 50 pages or so were terrible. It was an unsatisfactory conclusion that made me extremely sad that a book with such good potential ended up being so terrible.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Wow. This game is by far the most brilliant version of Mahjong I have ever played! It is extremely well organized, has wonderful music, and options galore! I particularly love collecting the badges. I have all but the Endless Play badge. I have promised myself that once I earn all of the badges, I will then buy Mahjong Artifacts 2.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|Amazing book. I have always been intrigued by the lives of North Koreans. I always knew the regime was oppressive, but the extent of the \\"brain washing\\" was unknown to me.  This book will make most anyone outside of North Korea count their blessings. Great read. Educational, exciting, and a page turner.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I remember several years ago looking for the Bible on tape. I'm just not a big reader especially old literature. however I managed the read but still wanted to read it again for studying. Anyways the point is Kindle.is really easy to read its even easier to listen. Hear the message out loud and be able to write notes on how what you read is in your life.

1594744769|5.0|This book was a pleasant surprise.  I read it on my KindleFire and did not have problems viewing the pictures as some have suggested through Amazon (that this book would be better in print version).  The author did an excellent job creating character depth and plots.  Overall, a very unique story which makes for a great read.  I am waiting for the sequel!
0439023483|5.0|I love the Hunger Games and all I had was a paperback and I move around a lot.  Getting the hardcover is going to be great - - and it's a first edition which I love!  Also, it got hear by the date they said it would - Perfect! =)
B006P0FD4W|3.0|\\"Paranormal Activity 3\\" attempts to tie the first two movies of the series together.  In this installment, we see how the storyline from the earlier films began.<br /><br />Julie, along with her young daughters Katie, Kristi, and live-in boyfriend Dennis have just moved into a new home.  Once settled, strange occurances start happening.  Videographer Dennis immediately sets up cameras throughout the house, hoping to capture anything strange on tape.  Meanwhile, Kristi has developed an imaginary friend she calls Toby.  With some prodding from her mom, Kristi reveals that Toby has been speaking to her.  Even more confused and anxious now, Dennis continues his monitoring.  He has even set up a camera on an old oscillating fan base.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, the bumps and noises turn into other more scary things, such as beds being moved across the room and items crashing to the floor.  In the end, the  evil forces unleash their full fury upon the family.<br /><br />While there are some truly scary parts in this movie, such as when Randy and one of the girls shut themselves in the bathroom and say \\"Bloody Mary\\" three times to when Katie is suspended in air by her hair, overall I thought the first two movies were scarier.  I thought that the oscillating camera was a nice trick, and the anticipation of watching the camera slowly pan from one room to the other helped add to the suspense of the movie.  That said, I just didn't get as scared as I did after seeing parts one and two.<br /><br />I am a fan of this movie trilogy and I think each movie has varying levels of suspense and terror.  Part 3 is not necessarily a bad movie; it's just not as scary as the earlier films in the series.  If you've seen the first two movies in the series, then deifinitely watch this one; just be prepared to not be scared quite as much.
B002G1ZHNQ|5.0|Many have written a review of this book and I think have described in great detail how good it is and beneficial to the aspiring guitarist.  I wanted to mention something about the Kindle version of this book though, because many have said that they would not buy the Kindle version, at least in part because native Kindle books do not support printing, and this is after all a workbook.  I considered this when I purchased the book, but after looking at some of the sample exercises, decided to get the Kindle version, because I like having the book available to me when I travel about with my Transformer Prime (Android has a Kindle app).  For those of you who are considering that you might want to get the Kindle version, all you really have to do is get yourself some guitar manuscript paper and you can do virtually all the exercises.  I in fact prefer it this way, because then--rather than writing in the book itself--can go back over the exercises again later.  You don't need to buy guitar manuscript, just print it yourself.  There are tons of sites that have this, here is one: [...].  Anyway, I just wanted to add this in case you would like the Kindle version, but some of the negative reviews regarding Kindle are deterring you from this.<br /><br />One last thing, before you buy the book, download the Kindle sample version, and make sure you like it before buying.  Hope this helps someone who wants the Kindle version but is on the fence about it.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I love the zombie genre and am addicted to any books related to it, but this one fell a little short for me. I read the rave reviews here and decided to purchase this one but unfortunately found myself having to push myself through the rest of the book.<br /><br />Some positives:<br />-The writing was good, the author is definitely talented in that respect.<br />-There were small tie-ins from unrelated narrations.<br /><br />The negatives:<br />-The interviewee's voices did not seem genuine; many times it sounded like the same person over and over.<br />-Everyone seemed to speak perfect English when retelling their stories. Being a person who has a family that is not native-English speakers, I find that hard to digest.<br />-The stories were more like short stories than a retelling of a whole time of history. I found the lack of continuity and a bit disappointing.<br /><br />I finished the book but it took me much longer to get through it than others in the same genre. I really wanted to like it, but for me it didn't live up to the 5 star reviews here.<br /><br />As a note, I would have given it 3.5 stars if it were possible...
B004LROUNG|4.0|I had not read a Grisham for a while. Now I am not sure why. This was a good, I don't want to put it down book. I loved the antics of these slapstick lawyers. Good Read

0307269752|3.0|This isn't a novel: This is a hodge-podge of geek fantasies, edited into prose.<br /><br />Weird, exotic, super-researcher? Check. Women (two of them, at least, creatively age-appropriate) throwing themselves at protagonist? Check. Voyeuristic sex scenes? Check. High-tech intrigue? Check, I guess, although that Lisbeth is momentarily stymied when not provided with a research target's SSN doesn't say much for her skills. I spend a lot of time at work researching people who either predate SSN's, or whose SSN's I have no business knowing, and do pretty well. And, really? Sweden's best hacker can't find a SSN on her own?<br /><br />The whole book just wasn't very interesting. The financial swindling story line was boring--watch _American Greed_ if you're into that kind of thing--and the might-be-a-murder storyline is cool until it sort of falls apart at the end. Frankly, I think it would have been better had she actually been killed. It's not particularly believable, either, that the police who did such an apparently thorough job in 1966 wouldn't have discovered what Blomkvist and Salander found (especially the Ford Anglia, which I guess was a rare car in Sweden in the 1960's and would have been a valuable lead). I work in an historical archive and actually do a lot of what they did with old pictures, and some of it sounds plausible, but a lot of it sounds like an incredible and conveniently plot-advancing case of good luck. And for those of you who fantasize about being left unsupervised all night in the archives? Forget it. Archivists are protection-trained Rottweilers when it comes to their collections.<br /><br />I don't really get the point of Salander's rape. As a counterpoint to what we find out about Harriet? There is no follow-up, though, and it doesn't really make sense. Is the state of social services in Sweden really so much worse than that of services in the U.S.?<br /><br />The writing is mediocre, which might be a translation issue, so I won't harp on it, and the characters aren't that great. Larsson introduces too many characters: People who only appear once and could have been simply \\"the file clerk\\" or whatever, are named and described, which makes the entire book feel cluttered and sort of confusing.<br /><br />Finally, I'm really, really, tired of \\"exceptional\\" characters who don't have to follow the rules. We'd all be more amazing if we didn't have to follow rules. There are a lot of things I could accomplish at work if I didn't have to follow personal privacy guidelines, but I don't, because it's both illegal and unethical.and the characters aren't that great.

0307888908|5.0|Very impressed with this book in the content that is covered and the references to specific action items individuals can take. The book has great references from today's business landscape and real-time references to the start-ups we all know and admire. It's a great read I encourage all to check out. It will help you as you plan your next move, from Plan A to Plan B to Plan Z.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|Don't get mad, but I agree with some others, this is not punk. But I didn't buy it thinking that I was getting punk. Nice selection of 60's tunes that are otherwise hard to find. I like and remember 80% of the selections. To say that punk bands were influenced by some of these 60's artists would be fine. The word \\"punk\\" was overdone in the booklet notes (in my opinion). A somewhat heavy handed attempt to broaden the sales base to include a younger audience? Note: I don't like punk, but give this Nuggets box set five stars!<br /><br />I did enjoy the reviews in the booklet. Loved the classic concert posters Rhino used in the booklet.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. Especially.enjoy the devotionals and plans. I read the bible thru every year but am really enjoying the historical plan
B006UG90RM|5.0|I've heard all of the nonsense...specifically the \\"Dave's voice is shot\\" and \\"Recycled old tunes\\" thing over and over. First off, who ever said Dave could sing that great anyway? Bon Scott certainly couldn't, yet are you going to accuse him of sucking? John Lennon was much poorer a vocalist than McCartney or Harrison, but would you accuse him of sucking? Thought not. DLR brings attitude to the band, and better yet, does not \\"enable\\" Eddie, as Sammy did with musical direction. Dave, for what it's worth challenges Eddie for the spotlight and Eddie is all the better for it as evidenced on this CD. Now, for all you \\"long time fans\\" who are complaining about recycled tunes, you obviously do not play music or know any musicians. All bands hold snippets or ideas for songs that appear on other albums. Some entire songs are put to rest and later heard on box sets as \\"leftovers\\" from other sessions. The new, old VH songs probably have more to do with entering back into the public eye then they do anything else...familiar ground with your friends and fans. When you go to your 30th year HS reunion, do you dive right in talking about your kids soccer prowess, or do you talk about the old days first to get comfortable? Which of course leads us into the new VH CD, A Different Kind Of Truth. No need to go into what everyone has already covered here...It's a hard charging VH of old sounding record. Dave is back with his tongue in cheek commentary, and reworked take on cliches that evoke a snicker almost every time. Eddie sounds great and is doing what he does best...playing guitar. Alex is Alex, which is kick ass, and Wolfie does not miss a beat in replacing M.A. on bass. This CD reminds me more of the Women and Children First era than it does 1984. Anyhow, I have my favorites \\"Stay Frosty\\", \\"As Is\\" \\"Outta Space\\", but in reality I like every tune...well worth the price. Enjoy VH Fans! Love went walking out!

0545425115|5.0|Hearing this was going to be made into a film and that it was more geared for teens I was skeptical in reading this. But after many reviews and suggestions from friends I gave it a shot... Everyone needs to read this!<br />It is not just for teenagers, the writting is not as mature as an adult book. But the plot is new, exciting and full of twists and turns. I would recommend this book to any one of my friends.

1451648537|4.0|Walter Isaacson has written a number of fine biographies including Kissinger, Benjamin Franklin, and Einstein.  In Steve Jobs, he once again performs his biographical magic.  For this project Isaacson combined over forty interviews to bring Jobs to life and most readers will not be disappointed.  However, the result is as much a history of Apple and the role that Jobs played in the development of the company as it is a biography per se.  I came away with a much better understanding of Apple the company  than of Jobs the man.  That shortcoming will, no doubt, be remedied with time and biographies to come.  This book is timely, informative, and entertaining nonetheless.  People who like biography will enjoy it, those interested in business and Apple will find it informative, and individuals seeking to better understand IT and our age will benefit.

B0070R40V6|5.0|I was a little hesitant at first, about reading a fantasy novel as I hadn't read one since Lord Of The Rings 30 years ago. But as it came so highly recommended from my middle son and so many of his friends, how could I not!<br />I am eternally grateful to them for being so insistent!<br /><br />The characters have true character and depth.  You love them, you hate them; you laugh with them, you cry with them; you cry for them. It is a roller coaster of emotion and adventure. The story line is truly gripping and I can honestly say that once you start, you can't stop and there are 5 books all up (so far). The 4th book was about to be published when I started reading this series for the first time.  Now that book #5 has been released I am starting from the beginning again (good excuse) so I can remember it all (as there is so much happening) and relive every moment so as to truly appreciate this next book.<br /><br />For those of you that are not into fantasy, you should still give it a try as I found it to be more like a setting in Medieval times and certainly not 'over the top' fantasy.<br /><br />It mainly follows the Stark's of Winterfell, who's kingdom is surrounded by a protective wall, which is manned by the Night's Watch, keeping them safe from the wildlings and the Others. But to the vast frozen north, something supernatural and sinister is brewing and has to be stopped before it breeches their security.  Thus begins the epic adventure full of mystery, intrigue, love, loss, tragedy, victory, assassins and betrayal.<br /><br />This is an epic masterpiece.  So beautifully written with believable characters and plots of such wonderful depth.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and all the books in this series, to everyone; whether you are a fantasy lover or not.  I doubt very much that you'd be disappointed!  Rather, I think you'll be extremely grateful!

0553801473|1.0|I loved the first 3 books, and got through each in about a week.  The 4th was not as good for reasons folks have already mentioned, but it still was readable despite some of my favorite characters being saved for book 5.<br /><br />After almost 1 month, I am only 1/3 through the book and despair of finishing it.  I have skipped some chunks that were most tedious, but even the chapters where my favorite characters (those few that have not been killed off or MIA), the story is not compelling.<br /><br />I guess these last 2 books are bridges for the next one, but good luck getting through this one.<br /><br />Maybe he is distracted by the HBO series, or HBO is influencing the story, but I fear I will have to put this book to rest after one last attempt.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|You are the senior assistant district attorney of a plush suburb of Boston when one of your son's middle school classmates is brutally stabbed to death in a local park.<br /><br />Then you read some disturbing comments on your son's Facebook page. You search his room and find a knife similar to the murder weapon. Disregarding your duty as an officer of the court, you dispose of it. You confront your son, but he is evasive and resentful. However, soon the police discover his fingerprints are on the sweatshirt of the murder victim.<br /><br />To make matters worse, there is some family history. Your father was a murderer and violence runs through your family several generations back -- but you have never told this either to your wife or son. So, do you have a \\"murder gene\\" running through your family DNA? Is there such a thing? You deny it -- but the whole book seems to be built around the possibility that there might be.<br /><br />This is the setup for this courtroom drama -- which I found enjoyable as long as I worked really hard to suspend my disbelief. As one \\"surprise\\" built up on the next, I found it increasingly tough. And it all builds up to a rather creepy finale.<br /><br />I see this book has been incredibly successful and popular and I certainly don't begrudge the author his success. It struck me as a very workmanlike thriller -- but nothing out of the ordinary.

B0046HA25Q|5.0|I love Brooks Adrenaline, so when this pair of an \\"older\\" model went on sale for only $75 I snapped them up. I don't need them now, but when my current pair goes dead, I will be taking these out of the box. I am a die hard believer in Brooks running shoes, they have been the best for me feet and I recommend them to anyone.

B0000DDAU9|4.0|Now after Mastodon has become one of favorite bands and I finally know each of their albums pretty well, I've decided to revisit all of them and work on my reviews.<br /><br />\\"Remission\\" was a very though album for me to get into. It's rough, it's weird, it sometimes even feels a little directionless but overall it's just immensely powerfull as most of Mastodon's works are. Although - after countless listens - I would consider it a great album, I still think it has quite a few flawed songs and it's probably my least favorite of their works after \\"The Hunter\\".<br /><br />The standout songs are \\"Workhorse\\" and \\"Trilobite\\". The first might be too repetitive to be perfect but at the same time it's very catchy and so freaking heavy. \\"Trilobite\\" is quite the opposite kind of song: pretty long, more melodic and with a very beautiful atmosphere. \\"Elephant Man\\" is also a nice melancholic way to end the album. Most of the other tracks are solid but some really hinder me from considering this album a favorite of mine. \\"Where Strides the Behemoth\\", \\"Burning Man\\" and \\"Trampled Under Hoof\\" are only mediocre songs. Although they deliver their aggression pretty well, they are the reason why I called this album directionless at times. They just feel not completely worked out, unfinished.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Remission\\" is a great album, especially for a debut. Mastodon are a unique and outstanding band that I can only criticize on a very high level. With their following album \\"Leviathan\\", they would deliver one of the best albums in existence and instantly become one of my favorite bands.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Critics, critiques. What's wrong really? Born to Die by Lana Del Rey has to be one of the most original records, if not groundbreaking. Perhaps, she's plain unlucky that she's singled out by the critics who seemingly loved to lambast her for anything she does. She looks sultry, has a distinctive voice and makes freaking good origina music. Pick any song off Born To Die and it will win any of Katy Perry's songs hands down, even the lyrically weakest song off Die is a gem. Sometimes, ignore the critics. listen to your ears and heart. This is a damn good record! I am sold. Lana, be the singer, model and whatever you wanna be. People are just jealous.
B005DKLPF6|3.0|Is this the same band that released \\"Leviathan\\" (which is one of my all-time favorite albums)? Damn, Mastodon has gotten soft on \\"The Hunter\\". At first, \\"Crack the Skye\\" wasn't really my thing either but \\"The Hunter\\" is not too complex for me to grasp, it's just not progressive enough. Sure, a few good songs can be found here but almost exclusively in the first half. \\"Curl of the Burl\\" is really catchy and I like the tracks 3-5 too but some other songs just let my jaw drop. Every time I listen to \\"Creature Lives\\" I have to make sure that it's really a Mastodon song. Honestly, this song is so horrible that I can't bear it.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Hunter\\" comes down to being an unimportant but listenable album with mostly average songs and a few highlights. Mastodon have abandoned a lot of their former style and quality and I think their times as one the most original bands of this century are officially over now. I'm outta here and going to turn on \\"Hearts Alive\\".
014241543X|5.0|I bought this for my tween-age daughter and ended up reading it myself.  This is absolutely one of my favorite books ever. It is beautifully written, there is not a single wasted word anywhere in the story.  If I Stay will leave you emotionally exhausted.  You can't read this book and not be changed in some small way.<br /><br />I just discovered that there is a part 2, called Where She Went.  I hesitate to read it because I'm afraid it won't be as good as the first part.<br /><br />I hightly recommend If I Stay.  Read it, then pass it along...  In fact this is one of the books that I keep multiple copies of so that I can give it to friends.
B000GPI2EK|4.0|After their eternal masterpiece \\"Leviathan\\", Mastodon went a different direction with their next album and became less brutal and more melodic on \\"Blood Mountain\\". While their first two albums were primarily heavy and powerful both in vocals as in instrumental work, their new style is more focused on clean vocals and softer guitars (which doesn't mean that their heavier side is gone completely). The songs got shorter too but they still feel progressive. All this is the reason that \\"Blood Mountain\\" is probably Mastodon's most accessible album (now along with \\"The Hunter\\").<br /><br />At first I was pretty disappointed with this release. For the most part I'm not really into softer music and this means that some songs in the second half of this album can't really satisfy me. However, the first four tracks are an outstanding start and enough to make me like this album. Especially \\"Crystal Skull\\" and \\"Capillarian Crest\\" are the standout songs that easily rank upon Mastodon's best material. But after \\"Bladecatcher\\" (that sounds very weird at first but after you got used to it you gotta love its awesome guitar tunes), the second half feels a lot weaker compared to the first. As I sad, softer stuff is not really my thing so this might be a reason why I don't find much merit here. Except \\"This Mortal Soil\\", I don't really love a song here anymore but I can listen to them every once in a while.<br /><br />\\"Blood Mountain\\" is still a pretty good album although the ones that were released around it, \\"Leviathan\\" and \\"Crack the Skye\\", are much better. Mainly because of the very well written first few songs, I can give it 4 stars. It might be a good way to start with Mastodon as it is rather accessible compared to their other works. But if you're looking for heavy stuff, rather go with their first two albums.
B001CC7PKS|4.0|what is the exact time of this movie it shows 103 min. and 124 min. the dir.cut should be around 133 min. so is there some mistakes here ? don't want to upgade from my dvd to a blu ray disc if the timing is the not the same as my dvd at 133 minutes
B001R4MEYI|4.0|A lot of months had to pass until I could finally grasp this album. I think I gave \\"Crack the Skye\\" 3 or 3.5 stars after my first few listens and now I'm just baffled about how much it has grown on me. It's definitely Mastodon's second best release after their legendary \\"Leviathan\\" which will probably never be reached by any Progressive Metal band.<br /><br />\\"Crack the Skye\\" has three absolutely incredible standout songs: \\"Divinations\\", \\"Quintessence\\" and the epic last track \\"The Last Baron\\". These are the type of song you can listen to all day and still get impressed everytime. Some drum and guitar passages are just so damn perfectly executed that you want to cry. The other songs are all great too but not entirely flawless as the mentioned ones.<br /><br />With Mastodon I learned that Progressive Metal will be my musical future. I'm sick of the same song structures over and over again. Verse 1, chorus, verse 2, chorus, bridge, chorus, chorus. It just doesn't work for me anymore. Nowadays I need bands like Mastodon, Tool, Isis, Opeth or Agalloch to be able to really feel music.

0439023521|4.0|I had just started hearing about this series now that the first movie is coming out.  I did a little research on what it was about and decided to give it a shot.  I received the book on Tuesday, started reading it on Wednesday and finished yesterday (Sunday)!  (And I'm a notoriously SLOW reader)!  I couldn't put it down!  The intensity of the plot line and the interesting sci-fi esque futuristic US is something to wrap ones head around.  It's a lot to take in and it's non stop action.  One can really get a sense of the whirlwind life the characters are experiencing.  I've ordered the second book (Catching Fire) and can't wait to get my hands on it.  I wasn't expecting the ending to be so gripping that I'd be itching for more.  But here I am and can't wait until it arrives!  In the meantime....I'm thinking of re-reading the first!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|buying the e-read version for your kindle is so convenient. Needless to say this book was such a fabulous read. I had to be rewarding myself for studying, then allowing myself to read this, at times I just couldn't put it down, dying to know what would happen next

1400069289|5.0|Charles Duhigg has written a fascinating and practical book about the role of habits in our personal lives, in organizations, and in societies. In his book \\"The Power of Habit,\\" Duhigg explains in clear concise language how habits work, how they are created, and how we may transform them. Using real-life examples, Duhigg illustrates how habits control much of our behavior and how we can consciously take control of our habits. He also shows how businesses use knowledge of habits to manipulate consumers. Examples are given of how business executives use the power of habits to shape corporate cultures and ways social and religious leaders employ habits in creating movements. Duhigg also explores addiction and the question of personal responsibility as it relates to habits. This is a useful book for leaders, managers, consultants, trainers, educators, counselors, parents, marketers, business owners. In fact, anyone can benefit from this book since everyone's life is shaped by habits. Duhigg provides us with the knowledge and processes needed to shape those habits.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I loved every thing about this series.  The acting is superb, the story is superb, as are the costumes. Am just sorry we have to wait for almost a year before the third season starts.

031617615X|5.0|In true Twilight fandom, I was very sad the closer I got to finishing the series.  This is a great read filled with romance and action that slowly builds book by book.  The love between Edward and Bella made the series.  Good YA/Paranormal Romance to start with, if you haven't tried the genre yet.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great read - Excited for the movie so I bought this to read them all.<br /><br />Suprised that there isnt totally fueled romance like the sparkly vampires!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I actually started watching this on HBO before I got the book and even though I know that the book is always better I still was not ready for how much better the book could really be! GRRM is a master! The characters are so real, right down to the bad in all of us. Like others have said, every character could be good or bad, you just can't tell and you never know who could die. Just when you think one of the main characters is going to pull through some how because they are a \\"Main Character\\" they up and die! Throws you for a complete loop and makes you afraid for the rest of the characters that you like.<br />I love it and I love the style. So happy I picked it up to read it, even though the series rocks!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app. so my kids I work with. they play over and over again. so do I. I recommend this.
B007BLCGNU|4.0|Eastwood offers a very complex view of J. Edgar Hoover.  He doesn't present him as a monster nor as a hero but as an american who truly believed he was protecting the interests of the United States.  If you are intent on seeing Hoover as a perverted monster who wore women's clothes then perhaps this isn't the film for you. Here he goes after Martin Luther King but is also credited with going after KKK members.  He's seen as waging war with communists and radicals but also strengthening the crime solving skills and protocols within all investigative agencies. He held files on virtually everyone but made sure they were destroyed after his death.  So was he a hero or a villain?  Eastwood seems to think he was just human, all too human.

I imagine his way with dealing with stressful situations speaks highly of him.  His drive to continue fighting and his family for supporting him was impressive.

0375842209|5.0|It's just plain and simple: I adore this book. I find it so creative, so wistful and beautiful. I love the way Death is characterized in this book with his haunted, mixed feelings for humans. I found all the characters to be well developed and so very human. I think a lot of people these days have a problem with sublety and if a book is not in-your-face they cannot comprehend its value. This is a gorgeous, nuanced, touching book that has made itself a firm place in my Top Five favorites.

1612130283|5.0|I usually do not write reviews but I couldnt resist on this one. I would give this one way more than 5 stars!  WOW is all I can say.  I agree with previous reviews that this book will ruin other books for you and you should definetly have the second and third book in the series ready to go so that you can start them as soon as you finish this one.  I will not go into detail of the book since that is done in previous reviews, but I do want to say that the author did a fabulous job with these characters.  I could feel the chemistry and love pouring off the page at me.  I was smiling through out most of the book! (crying at some parts!) My husband would walk in the room and laugh at me and ask what I was reading that put such a huge smile on my face.  The sign of a good book for me is that it makes you feel tons of different emotions through out the book and that you are sad when it is over and this one delivered for me.  I am currently reading the third and final book in this series and trying to drag it out because I know I will be sad that the story is over!!  This one will not disappoint and if you are uncomfortable with the subject of the book- PLEASE overlook those doubts and you will not be sorry that you did!!!  I anxiously await more from this author.
B0061S073A|3.0|I've been using this app on my Fire for my 3 and 4-year olds since Nov 2011. I've been very happy with it with one major exception. It works great on limiting the kids to certain apps and locking out wifi, but there is no method to restricting video or books. If they want to watch a video or read a book, I have to give them my Fire unlocked. So far my kids have not watched any videos I don't want them to see, but they have purchased several videos and books without my knowledge. Amazon has a no return policy on digital items, but so far they have refunded items when I have notified them that it was purchased accidentally.<br /><br />The other app [[ASIN:B0052UOONC Kid Mode: Play + Learn]] available for the Fire does not work without a wifi connection which I think is stupid since isn't using the Fire on the road without wifi access a major use for the Fire?
B0000ADY9I|5.0|This is a Rock & Roll Landmark Album, that is broadly recognized in the music industry, as definitely one of the greatest double live albums ever recorded. It captures the early, Allman Brothers Band at their creative and performing peak. This includes all the original founding members:<br /><br />Duane Allman - Lead & Slide Guitar<br />Gregg Allman - Organ, Piano, Vocals<br />Dickey Betts - Lead Guitar<br />Berry Oakley - Bass Guitar<br />Jaimoe - Drums, Congas, and Timbales<br />Butch Trucks - Drums & Tympani<br /><br />Other Guest Musicians include:<br />Thom Doucette - harmonia<br />Elvin Bishop - Lead Vocals & Guitar on \\"Drunken Hearted Boy\\" a song Elvin wrote.<br />Steve Miller - piano<br />Bobby Caldwell - percussion<br /><br />As Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top describes it in the \\"100 Greatest Artists of All Time\\" Special Edition Issue (Summer 2011 p.67) of \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine, ...\\"There are moments on At Filmore East that defy description - where the Allmans take the music to places it had never been....\\" In other words, this great classic is just difficult to describe with words. You just have to listen to it to understand and appreciate just how great it is.<br /><br />The entire double live album is \\"awesome\\" from beginning to end, but the band really jams, and improvises spontaneously, on the songs \\"Whipping Post\\", and especially on \\"Mountain Jam\\" which goes on for 33+ minutes. It just goes to show you how \\"in sync\\" the band was when this double live album was recorded back in 1971 at Bill Graham's Fillmore East in New York City.<br /><br />In conclusion, there is no doubt, that this is one of the greatest double live albums ever recorded, and it captures the early Allman Brothers Band at their creative and performing peak.
0553807919|4.0|I picked up this book encouraged by the fact that it is based on neuroscience.  The authors focus more on practical advice for how to work with your child to use the different parts of their brain than the underlying neuroscience.  I prefer to understand theory first so that I can develop my own strategies for implementing it so I was a little disappointed in the limited coverage of the cognitive and emotional theory.<br /><br />Putting the disappointment in the lack of theory coverage aside, the advice is useful and it works.  One of the strategies promoted in the book is to help your child to understand their emotions from the right brain by using their reasoning skills from the left brain.  The authors promote integrating memories, particularly painful ones, by reliving the experience to understand it.  I was skeptical of the habit of attaching causes to all events, particularly emotional ones.<br /><br />There may be therapeutic reasons for attaching a cause (even an incorrect one) to an event as I quickly learned by applying the strategy.  Our 3 year old had a doctor's appointment last week and did not want to go because she \\"didn't like it\\".  I tried to figure out why by stepping through the process with her so she could remember it. (First we go to the waiting room - do you like the waiting room?  Yes, I get to look at pictures... and so on).  We figured out that last time she went to the doctor, she got her ears pierced (which she wanted) and it hurt.  Once she understood her fear was related to the pain from ear piercing and not the doctor in general, she was happy to go to the doctor.<br /><br />I look forward to using more of the strategies in the book to help our daughter better integrate her emotional and analitical sides of her mind.  I give the review 4 stars because I would prefer more theory coverage.

B001Q94TQA|5.0|Once (2006)<br />Drama, Music, Romance, 85 minutes<br />Directed by John Carney<br />Starring Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova<br /><br />The opening scene in Once shows a guy (Hansard) busking. The song is unremarkable, but a few people like it and give him their change. Then, two minutes later, something incredible happens. We see the guy singing at night when the streets are virtually deserted. Although he's alone, he's pouring his heart out using his beaten up guitar and raspy voice.<br /><br />I was hooked from that moment on.<br /><br />When the guy looks up, there's a girl (Irglova) standing there listening. We never learn their names. It's as if the story is more important than the people in it. She gives him 10 cents and they begin talking. He works with his father in a vacuum cleaner repair shop and she has a vacuum cleaner in need of repair. When she brings it the following day, she treats it like a dog on a leash.<br /><br />The two have lunch together and she takes him to a music shop where the owner allows her to play piano. When she plays a piece by Mendelssohn, the guy's jaw drops open in astonishment. She invites him to join her on his guitar and he teaches her how to play one of his songs. That's how they begin their friendship.<br /><br />The setting is Dublin and life isn't easy. The guy and the girl don't have much money. But what does shine through is the Irish sense of community. They love life and the people seem genuine and real. That description also applies to Once.<br /><br />The film was shot on a budget of around £100,000 using two Handycam camcorders, but you'll quickly forget that and focus on the story.<br /><br />The guy has broken up with his girlfriend and she has moved to London. The girl married at a young age, but her husband is back in the Czech Republic and has left her. So there's the possibility of romance and I won't ruin what happens for anyone who hasn't seen the film. What's even more important is their shared love of music. The two have a real connection and she wants to help him reach a wider audience by negotiating the use of a local music studio for the weekend.<br /><br />There are two wonderful reactions later in the film. One comes from Eamon, who is an audio technician at the studio; the other comes from the guy's dad when the guy plays him a CD.<br /><br />The special features mention that over half the film is told through the use of song, but this is not a musical. The songs never make you step outside the story and they come across as totally natural. As well as music, there's plenty of dry humor, but the story is mainly about relationships and pursuing your dreams.<br /><br />Once is one of the most heartwarming stories that I have ever seen. The song Falling Slowly won the Oscar for best song and Hansard and Irglova have toured under the name The Swell Season. It just goes to show that you don't need to spend millions in order to make a film that touches people, and this touched me more than most.<br /><br />In a world which rewards artists with the right look and a manufactured sound, it's refreshing to see people with real passion succeed.<br /><br />The UK Blu-ray is region free, although the special features are audio only unless you use a region B or region free player.music.

1552095258|1.0|I was excited to find a book on crafting canoe paddles only to be let down by the lack of information a reader would expect. The author writes of forms,  jigs, and tools that he has built for shaping canoe paddles but fails to explain or show how to make these items. This book gives the history of canoe paddles and misses quite a bit of information that is helpful for the build. There is also a  lack of clear or detailed pictures and absolutely no color pictures. This book is great for the coffee table but less effective if you want a step by step on the paddle building process. There is also no mention of wrapping the finished paddles with fiberglass as do many paddle makers. (e.g. watch the construction video on whiskeyjack paddles website).

Oh I see, old lady Dale, and sickly girl in bed are far more interesting than him. Ladies, where's my clean laundry and ice tea? Let's ignore our kid and NOT keep tabs on him, as it worked so well for Sophia.<br /><br />Even without the zombie outbreak, most of us keep tabs on our children. I would think it would be even more important with a zombie outbreak. Of course Sophia's mother was allowing her husband to beat her and molest her child(Season 1) so maybe nothing changes when the world ends.<br /><br />Good to know there is still a show that shows women and minorities know their place. Somebody get Rush Limbo on the phone and tell him \\"sponsors ponsors, who needs 'em.\\" Since anime writers appear to involved, I can only tell you underage girls with really short skirts are next.<br /><br />The good news is one down, eight to go. Hopefully the writers body count is higher.

B000002J6H|5.0|First of all, I see no need to disparage any member of CSNY to prove the Amazon reviewer wrong. Of, course his \\"not the most accomplished\\" statement is absurd, one listen to this album proves that true. The Allmusic Guide stated that this album is almost the equal to Crosby Stills and Nash and Deja Vu and a jaw dropping experience - I agree wholeheartedly. I also feel the same way about Crosby's first solo album and the first album by Crosby/Nash. These musicians were simply on one spectacular roll back in the early 70's.  Just for historical purposes alone this is worth buying as this is the only time Rock's two greatest guitarists, Jimmy Hendrix and Eric Clapton appeared together on the same album. \\"Do For The Others\\" and \\"To A Flame\\" are my two favorite cuts on the album, I consider them Still's two best ballads ever. I love the first Manassas record but I think this is marginally better due to the quality of the songwriting. Only someone VERY accomplished could have produced a classic such as this.

0385344228|4.0|There are a two books publishing within two months of each other, both about fathers dealing with their sons being accused of murder. The first is Defending Jacob by William Landay. The other is Noah Hawley's The Good Father, publishing March 20th.<br /><br />The main character, Andy Barber, is an assistant DA in a town in Massachusetts. When a teen age boy is murdered, he is the prosecuting attorney until his son Jake is accused of the murder. The dead boy bullied Jake, and Jake was tired of it. But Andy believes that a man previously accused of molesting a young boy, and who was seen in the park where the boy was murdered, is the real killer.<br /><br />Andy is forced to take a leave from his job, and his wife Laurie has a hard time dealing with the accusation, the loss of her friends and the isolation of her family. She finds out that Andy has been keeping a big secret from her, and this causes her to pull farther away from her husband.<br /><br />There is a lot of suspense in this novel, and Landay excels in the courtroom scenes, especially the scenes with Andy on the stand battling against his former colleague who wishes to takes Andy's position in the DA's office.<br /><br />This novel is unsettling for parents, and will cause you to ask yourself if you really know what's going on your child's life. With all of the social media and helicopter parenting today you may think you know everything about your child, but this novel may disabuse of that quaint notion. Laurie has a line early in the book after the murder but before Jake is accused, talking to other mothers she says,<br />\\"I think we overestimate what we can do as parents. Your kid is your kid. You get what you get.\\"<br />The nature versus nurture question definitely comes into play in this novel.<br /><br />This novel drops a bomb at the end, one that the author only slightly hints at, but I got a sinking feeling about where it was going. Yet I still didn't know exactly how it would end, and it is a shocker, one that almost caused me to fall off the treadmill when I got there.<br /><br />Landay skillfully takes the reader on a roller coaster ride, and this is one crackerjack of a novel.

0812550706|5.0|I first Read Ender's Game over fifteen years ago, and remembered very little of it except the very basic plot.  I don't even remember if I finished it, but obviously it didn't have a lasting impression on me.  After seeing the reviews on Amazon, and it appearing as #3 on NPR's Reader's Picks for the \\"Top 100 Science-Fiction, Fantasy Books,\\" I decided I must have missed something and should give it another try.<br /><br />Ender's Game has all of the classical elements of storytelling, without falling into the \\"technology trap\\" that captures so many science fiction books.  Instead of focusing on technology and spending half the book trying to \\"wow\\" the reader with descriptions of future weaponry, warp drives, and quantum mechanic spaceships, the success of Ender's Game lies in the character development and plot.  Set in Earth's far future, most of the story takes place within our own solar system.  New technology exists, but although there are obvious advancements, they are easy enough to grasp without having to suspend disbelief or take up too much complexity within the book.  This leaves the focus on six-year old Ender Wiggin, an obviously brilliant child who is groomed to become the savior of humanity from an encroaching alien race.  Card immediately sets him up to be a likeable character by making him the object of ridicule and bullying among his peers and sibling. This is a theme that is maintained throughout most of the book, and Ender's struggle to survive along with his response to it, ensures that the character is not alienated from the reader by his overwhelming intelligence.  The idea that Ender is only six years old presents an entirely different aspect that sets the book apart from its contemporaries.<br /><br />It's likely that I didn't have enough experience with the science fiction genre when I initially read Ender's Game, because it is a masterpiece of storytelling and definitely deserves its place among the top of the lists.  I would definitely recommend it to science fiction fans, but also to readers who don't normally read that genre.  It is a short read that will hook you from the beginning and not let go until the cleverly-designed climax.  There is much more to Ender's Game than just space battles and laser guns.<br /><br />Ender's Game is the first book in The Ender Saga, which currently consists (by order of release) of:<br /><br />Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)<br />[[ASIN:0812550757 Speaker for the Dead (Ender, Book 2)]]<br />[[ASIN:0312861877 Xenocide (Ender, Book 3) (Ender Wiggin Saga)]]<br />[[ASIN:0765304740 Children of the Mind (Ender Quartet, Book 4)]]<br />[[ASIN:0765342405 Ender's Shadow (Ender, Book 5)]]<br />[[ASIN:0812565959 Shadow of the Hegemon (Ender, Book 6)]]<br />[[ASIN:0765340054 Shadow Puppets (Ender, Book 7)]]<br />[[ASIN:0765347989 First Meetings in Ender's Universe]]<br />[[ASIN:0812571398 Shadow of the Giant (Ender, Book 8)]]<br />[[ASIN:0765358999 A War of Gifts: An Ender Story (Ender Wiggin Saga)]]<br />[[ASIN:0765344157 Ender in Exile]]<br />Shadows in Flight (The Shadow Series)mend it to science fiction fans, but also to readers who don't normally read that genre.

B0018QQQK8|4.0|Overall I really liked this book. I loved the natural relationship between Beth and Logan. I could not stand Clayton, for obvious reasons, and I did not liked the end. At all. It felt too rushed, like there were some chapters missing between the last chapter and the epilogue. The epilogue did wrap things up nicely, just not as much as I had hoped - especially for a story such as this. There were too many things not explained, at least that's how I felt. That being said, I did like the story and I'm sure I would read it again. I can't wait to see the movie!
B0059XTUMC|5.0|My first ideas about The Artist were that it was a re-hash of A Star is Born but I was pleasantly surprised by the story and the marvelous performances.  The performances by Jean Dujardin, as silent movie star George Valentin, is a tour-de-force and magnificently conveys all the emotions of his fall from stardom.<br /><br />The film begins in 1927 when Valentin (modeled after Douglas Fairbanks) is at the top of his profession. He has a chance meeting with (and is attracted to) a young dancer and would-be actress, beautifully played by Bérénice Bejo.  As it was for many stars of silent films, Valentin has problems adapting to sound movies. At the time, sound was considered a fad by many but audiences proved such ideas a fallacy, forcing studios to switch to sound as fast as possible.  Valentin bucks the trend by making an expensive silent film that bombs at the box office while the actress he had previously befriended is starring in a blockbuster under the name Peppy Miller.  The film chronicles the rise of Peppy Miller's star as Valentin fades into oblivion, helped by the Great Depression.<br /><br />I have had a long affection for silent films so it came as a nice surprise that The Artist was filmed using the same size film that produces a square box on the screen. The cinematography (by Guillaume Schiffman) was also reminiscent of silent film and was tones of the film were superbly rendered.  Interesting that a small clip from Fairbanks' Mark Of Zorro was included in the scene where Valentin is watching one of his movies. John Goodman was fabulous as movie mogul Al Zimmer and James Cromwell was terrific as Clifton, Valentin's supportive chauffer. It was also fun to see Malcolm McDowell in a bit part. And lest we forget, Uggie the dog certainly made the movie special and charming.<br /><br />Much credit for the success of the film goes to Michel Hazanavicius, who took quite a chance of making a silent film.  The period of the 1920's and 30's was beautifully broght to life.  I hope that The Artist places more focus on silent films, as they are beautiful works of art even if sometimes the acting is old-fashioned.
B0057R5XRG|3.0|I was extremely disappointed by the Jurassic Park blu ray set. I had the trilogy on dvd and was looking forward to this for a long time. The quality of the picture in comparison with the dvd was not that different. My disappointment peaked when I popped in JP III - which, being the most recent of the films, should have been as clear as anything just released - I watched the first three minutes - took out the blu-ray and watched the same three minutes on dvd - there was very little difference in the quality of the picture. (Which was grainy and dark in spots.)  If I thought I could get my money back from Universal I would! If you don't have the JP trilogy and you own a blu-ray player - by all means get it on blu-ray - But if you already own the trilogy on dvd don't waste your money! Spielberg should be embarrassed by this release....
0525478817|2.0|I think that that John Green may have tried to write a book that was different than the typical, tragic, book with main characters dying of cancer, but if that was his goal, he was not successful with the The Fault in Our Stars. The protagonists in this book, sixteen-year old Hazel and seventeen-year old Augustus, meet at a support group for cancer patients, and their love story evolves from there. These two are \\"wise beyond their years\\" due to their circumstances, with clever, quirky conversation, peppered with vocabulary and thoughts worthy of twenty-eight year olds. They end up sounding very much like the Encouragements that Augustus' mother has throughout the house, the ones that they see as trite and simplistic. There is Death in the end, but of course there are Lessons Learned and Life Goes On. Perhaps because cancer, disease, and death are such painful and personal experiences, this book just came off as dishonest, manipulative and gimmicky.

B006XOBFTM|4.0|These historical recordings are self-recommending in their new bargain box updated to 24-bit sound. Another great plus is the inclusion of two recordings of the Mahler First, the mono one with the New York Phil. from the early Fifties and the remake in stereo with the Columbia Sym. The former is arguably Walter's greatest Mahler recording, along with Decca's Das Lied von der Erde and the stereo Ninth Sym. with the Columbia Sym., also included here. The stereo version of the First is slow and affectionate; it can be appreciated as a valedictory statement, despite the rather obvious weakening of the old and ill Walter's energies.<br /><br />The other two recordings that stand out for me are the Fifth, a mono recording with the NY Phil. that retains its power from an era when this symphony was rarely recorded, and the Second, a prime example of how Walter's mellower, more Viennese approach to Mahler could capture a unique spirit that transcends technical questions - on technical grounds the modern era would bring any number of flashier, more virtuosic recordings.<br /><br />The remaining discs are filled out with readings that have always been controversial. The Fourth, in mono with the NY Phil., is not one of Walter's best recordings of this work (there are several other options form live concerts on various labels). Desi Halban is inferior in the finale - as also in the scattered songs that used to be filler for the symphony - and the sound needs work.  On the vocal front, Walter chose Mildred Miller, an otherwise neglected mezzo, for his stereo Das Lied and Wayfarer Songs. I find her completely inadequate in both scores; thank goodness we have three other versions of Das Lied from Walter, of which my favorite is the live one in concert with the New York Phill, on several labels, although I recognize the legendary status of the Decca studio recording with the Vienna Phil.<br /><br />Whatever you think of each performance on its own, these 7 CDs could hardly be cheaper, and the sound, although not greatly improved over previous issues, is worth a try.r, and the sound, although not greatly improved over previous issues, is worth a try.
1466401885|1.0|This is one of the most irresponsible works I've seen by an author. I will grant you that it is fiction, but the reviews I'm seeing, mostly from teenage girls, indicate that they don't necessarily get just HOW fictional a character he is. \\"Travis is HOT!\\" \\"I want a Travis of my own!\\" These comments indicte that these people are immature, inexperienced, and don't get the danger signals Travis's character is giving...and some of the signals are really obvious! So the author is encouraging females to think that Travis is \\"hot,\\" and to search for \\"a Travis of their own,\\" and doing so will land them in a world of trouble.<br /><br />Because this fictional Travis doesn't exist in real life. In real life, he's abusive and will hurt the girl. In real life, he will separate the girl from her family (and hopefully you don't have a family like Abby's) and her friends and start running her life. And hitting her. And forcing her to do only what HE wants her to do.<br /><br />So enjoy this book ONLY if you really understand just how fictional it is. Understand that there is no REAL Travis out there, and any attempt to find one could put you in actual danger.

Other words, of course, come to mind now: funny, bittersweet, troubling, honest...but I think my first word says it best.  A good book is hard to find.  This book is a GOOD book.  Yes, it's well written and witty and \\"captures something true\\" (to be cliche) but it's more than the sum of its parts.  It's a perfect storm.  Read it to laugh.  Read it to cry.  Read it to feel human.  It's small but beautiful.
B0061JPYX2|4.0|Great album showing the great range and creativity of Amy Winehouse -- a bright spark for a very brief period of time.  Like Janis who was lost to another generation, her music will live on forever.

0312330537|4.0|Shantaram is the story of a desperate drug addict who busts out of prison in Australia and flees to Bombay in the early 1980s.  The narrator begins as a low-level criminal, but rises up through the Bombay underworld, working as a counterfeiter, money launderer, and more.  Gregory David Roberts' novel is an old-fashioned first-person adventure story that is colorful, poignant, and kicking with life.<br /><br /> The narrator is a sort of cross between Chuck Norris and Mother Theresa, a street fighter with a hunger for selfless spiritual transcendence.  There are many colorful threads and shots of poetry in the pungent, nearly unbelievable story he weaves in his journey through prisons, slums, rural Indian villages, high end whorehouses, black markets, mafia councils, and even the mountains of Afghanistan.<br /><br />If a plot point here and there seems lifted from films such as The Godfather and Midnight Express, there is plenty of good writing that brings alive the sights and smells of the bustling underbelly of Bombay (now called Mumbai) and its wild extremes of gentleness and violence.

Only criticism is that there are quite a few spelling errors, some format problems with some of the italicised text and two of the chapters with different titles and different stories have exactly the same starting section which I don't think Conan Doyle would have done.

B004ZNANZA|5.0|Pink Floyd's eleventh studio album The Wall was released in December of 1979 and is a classic and regarded as the band's most ambitious masterwork.<br />This double album ranks up there with other noted classic rock double studio albums like The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, Tommy, Exile on Main Street, Quadrophenia, Blonde on Blonde, London Calling, The White Album, Physical Graffiti, Electric Ladyland and many others.<br />The concept for The Wall still holds up over 30 years after its initial release.<br />The idea came to bass player/singer Roger Waters whom was upset with himself after spitting on a fan on the last gig of the Animals tour at Montreal's Olympic Stadium.<br />In 1978, Roger was writing and recording demos that would become The Wall (many to appear on the Immersion Version in 2012). Meanwhile, drummer Nick Mason was off producing other acts (ranging from punk rockers The Damned to prog rocker Steve Hillage) whilst the other two principle Pink Floyd songwriters whom were guitarist/singer David Gilmour and keyboard player Rick Wright were recording their first solo albums in France which both came out in 1978.<br />In late 1978 the band, along with KISS/Alice Cooper/Peter Gabriel/Lou Reed producer Bob Ezrin, began demoing the songs for The Wall at Britannia Row Studios in London (these too are to appear on the Immersion Version in 2012).<br />The band properly began recording The Wall in April of 1979 in two studios in France (and later at studios in Los Angeles and New York) with Waters, Gilmour, Ezrin and engineer James Guthrie producing to avoid the crazy English tax laws as the band was almost bankrupt due to their agents stealing the money in a way that they still owed the British tax companies taxes.<br />All of the songs, save four, were written by Roger. The album's three best tracks \\"Young Lust\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" were co-written by Gilmour. Then, \\"The Trial\\" was co-written by Ezrin.<br />The Wall was a concept album which told the story of a character named Pink (a composite of Roger Waters and Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett).<br />After we begin with the bombast rock of \\"In the Flesh?\\", The Wall story begins when Pink goes through a traumatic childhood of losing his father in war (\\"The Thin Ice\\" and \\"Another Brick in the Wall (pt.1)\\"), cruel sarcastic teachers (\\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\", the chart-topping single \\"Another Brick in the Wall (pt.2)\\"), an overbearing mother (\\"Mother\\"), problems with adolescence (\\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\") problems with success (\\"Empty Spaces\\"), relationship troubles (\\"Young Lust\\" (wife leaves him), \\"One of My Turns\\" (snapping when the groupie comes in room and many other problems (like the wife beating in \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\") one goes through before walling himself off from the rest of the world (\\"Another Brick in the Wall (pt. 3)\\" and \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\").<br />The second disc starts with Pink walled off from society (starting with the classic \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\") then ponders his life in a hotel room (\\"Nobody Home\\") and thinks back to his father's death (\\"Vera\\" and \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\"). The highlight of the album is \\"Comfortably Numb\\" which tells the tale of Pink being confronted by a doctor to take something before he could go on with the show. The song was first intended for David Gilmour's 1978 solo debut but was thankfully left off and saved for The Wall. The track is a classic and is always in the Top 10 greatest rock song/guitar solo polls! The track \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is Pink being led to the show and then as a fascist dictator Pink is performing like a madman as depicted in \\"In the Flesh\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\" and \\"Waiting For the Worms\\" before having his own trial (\\"Stop\\" and \\"The Trial\\") and is ordered to knock down his wall to start life fresh (\\"Outside the Wall\\").<br />Band turmoil during 1979 reached an all-time high and Roger eventually kicked Rick Wright out of the band citing Rick wasn't doing squat whenin fact Roger was setting Rick up to fail from the word go. Rick was let go but stayed to finish the album and did The Wall shows in 1980/81 as a paid musician (the other three members lost money from staging the shows). Rick played on most of the album (even co-producer James Guthrie stated Rick played on more of The Wall than given credit) as does Nick whom is not on drums for half the record (Jeff Porcaro played drums on Mother, Jeff's father Joe played snare drum on Bring the Boys Back Home and there's no drums on some of the tracks).<br />Despite the band turmoil, The Wall became Pink Floyd's third US chart-topping album (stayed at #1 for 15 weeks), sold over 25 million in the US alone (second highest selling album of original material of all time here in the US and best selling double album ever though some configurations were on one cassette and one heavily edited 8-track cartridge), spawned the greatest rock concerts ever produced (documented on Is There Anybody Out There and many boots available) and a classic film.<br />As part of the Why Pink Floyd? reissue campaign, the band re-release this masterwork with a remastered CD painstakingly done by James Guthrie (one of the original co-producers of the album and the engineer of the album) and Joel Plante. Out of the CD issues I have owned of this album, this is probably my favorite version (sure beats the lifeless EMI Europe remasters from 1994) apart from the original vinyl record. Also the booklet is excellent and does a great job replicating the original vinyl LP art apart from the change in color text of front cover writing.<br />The Experience Version of The Wall (which this review pertains to) has a bonus disc consisting of the band's demos (Programs 2 and 3 had been around on bootleg for years in somewhat mixed quality sans the Demos of The Doctor and Run Like Hell). The first program of band demos I never heard before sans Another Brick 1 which was on the Pink Floyd Sampler released late last year. Then \\"Young Lust\\" was excellent and songs that became \\"The Hero's Return\\" is here as \\"Teacher Teacher\\" and I prefer this to what was on The Final Cut. \\"Sexual Revolution\\" is better here than on Pros and Cons. The demos sound great and the packaging is digipak and rather nice.<br />Then the Immersion Version is also available which has more demos including a medley of Roger's original demos for The Wall, David Gilmour's instrumental versions of \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" (all sounding better than the bootleg versions) out for years and \\"The Thin Ice (Reprise)\\" and \\"It's Not Too Late\\" outro to the two different demos \\"Outside the Wall\\". Then there is a remastered version of the 2000 live album Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81 which sounds more crisp and punchier than the version released in 2000. Then the DVD features the 2000 BBC produced documentary Behind the Wall (this time uncensored unlike the US version) plus a taster of the band performing at Earls Court in 1980. The video for \\"Another Brick 2\\" looks cleaner than the version on The Wall DVD. The books are nice with some previously unissued pictures and it has a scarf, credit booklet.<br />Some are griping and complaining that there is no 5.1 surround mix of the album. Well, the band and the label had a deadline to get this out. Also James Guthrie stated that the tapes of The Wall were in bad shape and needed to be fully restored so a 5.1 mix will come out on Hybrid SACD/DVD-A at some point. For now, The Wall Experience and Immersion versions will suffice.<br />Highly recommended!in fact Roger was setting Rick up to fail from the word go.

B0052U59F4|5.0|You need to read all three books. There is a story line and its sad and gripping. Its about neglect and child abuse along with all the rest. Its not the type of book I would usually read but I had to read all three.
B006ZBRMOU|4.0|Again the media has made more of something than really is written.<br />This is a very good book, well written.<br />It is NOT all torture, etc., however that said there is a lot ooh explicit sex --how can she still walk?<br />One error, if Christian has that much money, he would live closer to the city limits of Aspen.  The true wealthy live close, the \\"less so\\" in the 'burbs'.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I started book one not knowing anything really about it.  I absolutely COULD NOT put it down.  I started reading on a Friday at 4:00 p.m. and did not stop until I was finished!  I loved it so much I bought book two on my kindle right away and read till 4:30 a.m.  My husband said I did not move!  I was so drawn into everything about the book.  I loved the character development of both the main characters Ana and Christian.  The intense sexual content along with the psychological drama was just exhilarating.  I am writing a review on this book, but the next two are equally if not more intriguing and page turning.  This author has done a phenomenal job of creating a story and characters that make you just want to know more and more.  I read ALOT and I cannot think of a book I have been this seduced by.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|fun game and super addicting. bummer that you have to spend real money for gems to buy upgrades. still fun though!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a very entertaining game!  You don't have to be smart to play it.  I guess that's why I like it...it's easy and fun and that's what games are suppose to be.  Be warned: this game is highly addictive.
B006SVA0V4|5.0|This episode made me laugh and cry. Jason Segal at his finest! He perfectly drove an emotional, yet hilarious, plot and HIMYM continues to be one of the best shows on TV right now. More episodes like this and I will be one happy Mother Meeter.
B000002AP1|5.0|This is the record that inspired punk, grunge and thrash. Songs like Gimme Danger, Search and Destroy, I need Somebody and Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell are timeless and relevant forever. This Iggy Remix brings out the heavy and distorted elements and is the definite version of this masterpiece. Its much better than the weak and effeminate Bowie mix. This is the nasty, loud, dirty mix that music was intended for. Buy it and turn it up!
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Much better than what came with the Kindle Fire, which is practically non existent and poorly functional at best. I recommend this player as a default to all of your side loaded movies.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great game and I think everyone should download this app. you won't be disappointed. please download it.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Alright, so most of the books or files we're probably downloading aren't exactly bought; but are from reliable free sources (o_O) and they end up coming up on docs, which is a terrible format. Can't bookmark or anything -_-. This app is deff worth the price. IT IS easy if you're not a noob. If you are, no worries. Google it. Alright, so one of the nifty features are bookmarking.<br />You can actually flip your tablet (kindle in my case) and it changes the scrolling method. Right side up it actually shows the pages flipping. HOW FANCY IS THAT?! Quite.<br />You can even press the buttons up top and put notes in there. THE INDICATORS OF THE NOTES LOOK LIKE SMALL UNCOOKED BACON! Seriously though. they are Also easy to edit, move, and delete.<br />Not convinced yet?<br />You can change the reading from right to left or vice versa.<br />You add books or documents by clicking the little icon on the upper right hand corner on the screen that first opens up. The middle one I think o_o. You'll figure it out. if all fails, click all of them.<br />You can DRAW on the page. How awesome is that?!<br />It's the only app I've ever bought (I'm a poor college student) and guess what? IT WAS WORTH NOT EATING FOR THREE DAYS!!<br />I'm joking.<br />Srsly tho. Kindle fire users, if you haven't bought this app and are using the sickish default Pdf reader on your tablet, I don't know what you're doing with your life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book kept my attention the entire time. I grew to love the characters. Even my 12 year old son has started reading it.
B004I744AS|5.0|I was looking for a dictionary and found this. I don't use it as a dictionary now. The daily quotes, news, birthdays and all the other information bring me back every day.
0553386794|5.0|I had first watched the series last year which I really enjoyed.  Reading the book after was very much the same experience only better.  I cannot think of another series or movie that followed the inspirational book so closely.  I'm sure that's part of the success of the series is that they knew the book was so well done that even most of the dialogue seems to be verbatim.  And I can't see any reason they would have changed it.  Everything in the book was very well done.  The plots, the way the characters intertwine, and mostly the twists and turns that you'd never see coming.  All really well done.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I think this is a great app. perfect for daily notes :) I use it to remind me of certain things I need to get done, and recipes and so on. I love that you can make more than one notebook so you can keep your notes organized.

1118156315|5.0|\\"Business Model Generation\\" [[ASIN:0470876417 Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers]] provides a useful framework for thinking about an organization's value proposition, customers, assets and opportunities. \\"Business Model You\\" provides a guide and framework for reflecting on what we want, what we have, and what we need, including key partners and resources we tend to overlook as we pursue meaningful work.
1401322425|5.0|[[ASIN:1401322425 Jamie at Home: Cook Your Way to the Good Life]]This book is awesome! A must have. I wish I had my own year round garden. So inspiring and insightful has me wondering if I could manage my own green house.
1118156315|4.0|I just gave a presentation of this book to Master's students at a business school and they found the framework most interesting. In particular, seeing yourself as your own company gives you a holistic picture of what's important in any career move. The canvas identifies your strengths and weaknesses to your approach in reaching your career goals. It also provides an interesting handout to use in informational interviewing.<br /><br />If I had only one book to pick for career hunting I would use \\"What Color is your Parachute\\". There is a reason it has sold 10 million copies. I've used it in three major career moves and the results I've achieved make it one of the most influential books I've ever read.<br /><br />BMY is more useful for you the more work experience you have. It has good use cases based on individuals who have applied it in their own life. Do to its high-level approach I consider it a good addition to the \\"Parachute book\\", but not a substitute.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I found this book to be excellent reading. I had not seen the movie, but I enjoyed the book so much that I could not put it down. I was reading every second that I could. It does have some graphic words about the care of the horses, but all in all, every thing turned out for the best.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|I don't know how anyone could say a bad word about this movie.  Excellent and heart-warming from start to finish.  This was my 2-year-old's first experience with the Muppets and she was captivated.  We talked about it for weeks afterwards, and I can't wait to get it for her on Bluray!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. An adult \\"twilight\\" but not as intense as \\"sookie\\". I look forward for the sequel.
B004W89N72|2.0|Good thing it's free today. Not worth the $1.5 for a calendar whose functions include only basic entry, color stickers, a search function and few gestures. Doesn't include items alarms or synchronization (as in it doesn't synch at all). I uninstalled it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I start the morning with my youverion Bible. This is a very fine app. Many choices between different versions means a broad range of people are reached.  A cup of coffee, my Bible and the word of the lord will always give me a great morning.

1451637500|5.0|DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY ended with Miles Vorkosigan and his wife Ekaterin attending the birth of their children.  Usually this sort of event signals the settling down of a character into a life of peace and tranquility.  But we're dealing with a character for whom \\"peace\\" and \\"tranquility\\" are only words in a dictionary.  CRYOBURN throws the reader immediately into the plot with Miles stumbling about a maze of tunnels while under the influence of drugs.  He's on the planet Kibou-Daini because the people of that world possess a technology for preserving the sick and dying in suspended animation, and they wish to establish a franchise within the Barryaran Empire.  But suspicions have been raised, and Miles has been sent to ferret out the facts.  Good call as, in typical Miles fashion, he soon insinuates himself deep into the sort of plots, schemes and derring-do that has made his life a joy to read.<br /><br />The opening pace of the book is rather reminiscent of SHARDS OF HONOR or KOMARR; starting out carefully and taking a little time to speed up to the sort of roller coaster ride the reader found in MEMORY or A CIVIL CAMPAIGN.  But since a law has apparently been passed making it illegal for Lois McMaster Bujold to write a bad novel, nothing truly wrong arises from the situation.  As usual, Miles manages to find allies in the most unexpected of places, and continues to apply the force of his personality the way Zorro handled a sword.  Even better, there are bits of insight into Miles' home life (including an extremely poignant yet not-too-unexpected conclusion).<br /><br />For fans of the Vorkosigan saga there should be no worries.  Miles is once again deep into it (and so should the reader).
B003O86FMW|2.0|I would have like to know the book was for young readers.It was not a bad read, but a little dull in spots.
B004W89N72|5.0|Does what it says it will do. Of course it's somewhat a redundancy in that you could just go straight to your calendar, but this is a pretty good concept. Ok, MEMO to the newbie(s), the FAOTD is usually posted at MIDNIGHT West Coast time, which means 3am on the East Coast. Depending on the app, it will go live (free) by the half hour. Sometimes sooner. All you have to do is WAIT! Pretty simple actually! :)
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app!  I cant find any other free Bible that has NIV on it! but there is one catch. you need wifi! I cant use this at my church because I need wifi! it stinks. if u have wifi its great if you don't. don't get it
B0063IH60K|5.0|Runs as expected, unobtrusive ads for the most part, couldn't ask for more.  There are lots of solitaire apps, but I use this on all of my Android and iOS devices.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this Stephen King title. It was almost  true to life with details of the time period and because I have lived thru this time span it did seem to be a true story.

B002ZTIIXK|5.0|I have been looking for \\"new\\", well, new to me, artists to listen to, and was quite pleased when I recently stumbled on the musings of K.D. Lang.  Her vocals can only be described as lush, sweeping and haunting.<br /><br />Crying, her duet with Orbison, really touched me.  I then bought every K.D. Lang item I could.  In fact, I've been listening to this particular Recollections album non-stop for like 3 days now.  Unlike some, I loved Miss Chatelaine.  The only track I really didn't like was her duet with Tony Bennett.  I'm just not a big fan of Tony's.<br /><br />Oh, and K.D.'s rendition of Hallelujah is just....mesmerizing.  I will definitely be seeing her on tour as soon as she comes to my area.<br /><br />K.D. is gifted so much, and her vocals are so deep and lush as the vocals and instrumentation mix.<br /><br />For people like me, who think real pop music is being taken over by endless synth beats and vocoders and sounds all the same, K.D. was a breath of fresh air.  I wish we had more Adele's and K.D.'s out there making real pop music as it was meant to be played.  So happy I found K.D.!!!!
B004W89N72|4.0|Would not pay for it, however it is not a bad app. Furthermore I do not have google calendar (nor have I ever heard of it), so there is no letdown in that department as I see in the majority of the other reviews.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Just saw Act of Valor on 03/04/12 and it was superb. I actually preferred the real navy men in their parts, rather than an \\"actor\\" such as Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin or cocky Tom Cruise. I didn't care if the navy men could not act... it was more real to me than any Hollywood actor could try to portrayal.<br /><br />We absolutely need more movies LIKE this and we absolutely need REAL men like the real men in the movie in our lives.<br /><br />The United States of America would not be a safe place period, if we did not have such brave men and woman of all military service and our local men and women fighting on our own streets.<br /><br />My thoughts, prayers and gratefulness to all the men and women that serve and to their families that await for their safe return... so that my freedom will not be taken, so that I can sleep well and safe every night, so that I enjoy the smallest of things that I take for granted (such as walking out my door alive or enjoying a meal with a friend in a restaurant without being bombed).<br /><br />Shame on any of us in the United States of America who does not see how great, good and necessary this movie is for Americans... to always be reminded. Great job navy men and great job director.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Poorly written novel that really missed the mark.  Given the title I thought it would be much more informative as to what goes into the inner workings of a sniper.  This was merely the ramblings of a soldier.  Like reading the pages torn out of someone's diary.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did.  How this book moved to the top of the best seller's list, I will never know.
B000R9EG3Q|4.0|I thought this autobiography was a very insightful portrait of the President as a young man.  I thought, given the groundswell of controversy surrounding him and his Tea Party perceived hatred of white people, it was revealing to see how conflicted about race Obama really was/is.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that the book was written and published before he ever held office, so some of the less flattering details about his life were also on display without the benefit of a political spin team varnishing away the rougher edges.
B004ZQBP3Q|5.0|Really like all the songs on this.. Good to listen to and even exercise to.. Love it.. Would suggest this to anyone who likes them as I am sure alot were bought before I purchased this.. Always play it in my car...

All i could think of when reading the sex scenes was \\"this christian character is talking about 'BEATING' Anna and she LIKES IT.\\" I'm sorry, when was abuse veiwed as hot?<br /> Although it wasn't the worst book i've ever read in my 20 years of life, it truly is<br />50 shades of F***ed up.
0688101364|5.0|Like her other books, this book was not a dissapointment at all! This book definately inspires you to bake cookies. All you have to do is look through the book and you want to make cookies, and not just for Christmas! The instructions are clear, the recipes are great and the pictures alone put you in the mood. The cookies look like cookies you could get in a bakery and they far less expenstive to make, and for many of they you only need common ingredents you might already have at home, also these cookies contain real butter and flavors which often the bakery ones do not. So if you love to bake and want to save money on going to a bakery, this book is definately helpful. I just made the Christmas cookies for a valentines day party, used Heart molds and followed the icing recipe, decorated them in red sprinkes and they were great! The Mapel cookies are nice too, very similar to the green leaf chocolate filled cookies you get in the bakery, in fact you probably could add gree food coloring and use one of her chocolate filling recipes or just melt chocolate and sandwitch them, use a smaller cookie cutter or simply shape them into a small leaf with a knife and you got those leaf cookies you get in the bakery. I have been baking cookies for a long time, but this book makes baking bakery quality cookies at home simple, and better tasting, less expensive. The author explains very well, while sometimes I do have to subsitute for ingredients (instead of mapel flavoring, I add a little extra pure mapel syrup) the recipes still come out perfect. I have never been frustrated with a recipe in the book at all, as the recipes are forgiving (a little mistake in directions does not ruin it usually). All in all, a great book! This is probably my favorate of all her books as cookies are ideal for any occasion, as you bring then anywhere without worrying about plates or forks and they tend to be more popular then pies and cakes. Furthermore, many recipes require like three or four ingredients I often always have and great for a gift!

0307956350|4.0|The Expats is the story of Kate, an ex-secret agent, trying to be a housewife and not suspect everyone around her of being spies. It's harder than it sounds, and a better story, too.<br /><br />The story is told in what should have been a disorganized fashion but it ends up working somehow: four different phases of Kate's life, interwoven. It's not even done chapter by chapter or anything clean like that.<br /><br />The majority of the book is the story of Kate's husband getting a job offer in Luxemburg, Kate deciding to quit her job, and the family moving to Europe. They get settled in, start making friends, and so on. (If you have no sympathy for women who'd rather have a job and are a little angsty about being stuck doing housewifery, you'll probably find Kate a little whiny at times. If you know the frustrations of dealing with toddlers and wishing you could be out saving the world instead of folding laundry, you'll read a lot of your own thoughts in Kate's musings.)<br /><br />Instead of just playdates and chores, though, Kate finds herself in the midst of a situation that makes her secret agent instincts cry foul. Though she tries valiantly for a time to resist the urge, she does eventually start trying to figure out what the heck is going on. Without the backing of her former employer, and not even knowing if she might be the target of whatever hinkiness due to the inevitable Deep Dark Secret from her own past, things get complicated fast.<br /><br />I suspect no one reads a thriller for intricate character development, which is probably good, because there's not much in this book. The emphasis is firmly on spies, spying, secrets, betrayals, double-crosses, and the occasional fisticuffs. As the various timelines in the book unfold, secrets and revelations are doled out at a pace that keeps the reader eagerly turning pages without overwhelming them.<br /><br />In the end, it all comes together in a satisfying way, a neat-but-not-too-neat tying up of loose ends. There's even the vague possibility of a sequel.<br /><br />This is not a highly intellectual read, but it is engaging and entertaining. I recommend it for airplane or beach reading..

B005Q1W0ZQ|4.0|Thugh I love  the serie, and don´t worry about anything in the subjet, I complain about the fact that the second time I played it( I´m not a native English speaker), the image begun to broke untill was lost forever.It´s not my blue ray player fault, beacause it plays other discs properly.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|The most important 34 seconds of this film take place at the beginning and contain the potential for a film of its own.  Those critical moments occur when we briefly learn the backgrounds of the two main characters, Tom and Summer.  Tom's path is paved by romantic British pop songs and a mis-reading of *The Graduate*.  Summer's trail is blazed by her parents' divorce which leads her to love only 1) her hair, and 2) the fact that she can cut her hair and feel nothing.<br /><br />Applying psychological analysis to a romantic comedy may strike one as deliriously over-the-top, but John Bowlby's attachment theory runs through every vestige of *Five Hundred Days of Summer*.  Bowlby's original theory from the 1950s posited that an infant needs to develop a healthy attachment with at least one primary caregiver for social and emotional development to occur normally.  Starting in the late 1980s researchers began applying Bowlby's theories to adult romantic relationships.  Recently, writers Amir Levine and Rachel Heller published an intelligently written and consumer friendly book called *Attached* that distills these theories.  The authors suggest that we tend to follow one of three behavior patterns in our romantic relationships : (The descriptions below are quoted directly from the book description.)<br /><br />*  Anxious people are often preoccupied with their relationships and tend to worry about their partner's ability to love them back.<br />*  Avoidant people equate intimacy with a loss of independence and constantly try to minimize closeness.<br />*  Secure people feel comfortable with intimacy and are usually warm and loving.<br /><br />Fifty percent of the population is believed to fall into the secure category, and 50% into the insecure designation (anxious and avoidant types are split almost equally, each representing approximately 25 % of the population).<br /><br />Tom is anxious and Summer is avoidant.<br /><br />And certainly, I don't believe that all seven billion human beings on this planet simply fall into one of three categories, but I do believe these descriptions provide us with a vocabulary to discuss individuals' relationship tendencies and expectations.<br /><br />During the previously indicated 34 seconds, we learn scant little about the past experiences that led Tom and Summer to develop their insecure attachments (although the divorce of Summer's parents is a giant clue).  Is it any accident, however, that the opening credits consist solely of a montage of childhood movies?  The message is clear : Something was missing in both characters' childhoods.  So they wrote their own damaged scripts and have been interpreting the world through the visage of their unhealthy patterns ever sense.<br /><br />Tom is the naive romantic (an average to unhealthy \\"4\\" on the Enneagram, for anyone familiar with Don Riso's work) who hasn't learned how to apply his imagination to produce healthy outcomes, and is instead caught in a dream world while waiting to be rescued by \\"The One.\\"  He means well, but he makes the terrible mistake of projecting his fantasies and desires onto Summer, who is basically the innocent bystander.<br /><br />Summer is the classic avoidant, lacking in emotional perception and unable to read people's feelings and intentions.  She is overprotective of her emotions - not to profit, but to guard from pain.  Summer is intrigued by love but not willing to commit, insensitive but sometimes charming, nauseatingly inconsistent, and always placing facts over feelings.<br /><br />Some will argue that Tom is a fool for slobbering over Summer, and others would say he is sweet, sensitive, and deserving.  Others would argue that Summer is narcissistic and unfeeling, while others would say she is direct and succinct about what she wants (and Tom is to blame for refusing to pick up the memo).  But what we really have here is the classic anxious-avoidant trap playing itself out for the entertainment of the audience andthe misery of the participants.<br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT***<br /><br />Some would say of my analysis, \\"Lighten up.  Stop the psychobabble.  You're overanalyzing.\\"  At one time I would have made the mistake of thinking the same thing.  I can understand how someone might further respond by saying, \\"There's no trauma here.  Tom is just an innocent dreamer and Summer simply wanted to have her mid-20s fun before settling down with the `right guy,' whom she eventually found anyway.  The lesson we learn from the film is that these two tried equally and ultimately weren't meant for each other, but nevertheless transformed each others' way of thinking about love.  They grew as a result and took what they learned to the next relationship.  It's sweet.  All's well that ends well.\\"<br /><br />I think that's a fair interpretation, but the film's only major flaw is that it lends itself to such an interpretation at all.<br /><br />Specifically, I'm uncomfortable with Summer's sudden marriage.  This isn't entirely inconsistent with avoidant behavior, in that her actions are impulsive.  However, the scars from her parents' divorce run much deeper and clearly aren't resolved, and we oughtn't be led to think that her apparent embrace of love has solved a thing.  We don't see these scars in her aloof behaviors throughout the film, but clearly she bore witness to all the fighting, hurt, and brokenness of her childhood loss - she isn't healed.  And just having the \\"right guy\\" walk into her life isn't enough to change her world view or shift the satisfaction that she finds from cutting without feeling.  In their final scene together, Summer tells Tom she recently danced with him at a friend's wedding simply because she wanted to (with no regard for his feelings).  She also says she's glad he's doing well (even though he's obviously not), and she explains that things are different with her husband because \\"I just woke up and one day I knew... what I was never sure of with you.\\"  Her characteristic insensitivity tells us two things : 1) That she has not grown at all due to her time with Tom.  She is still oblivious to other people's needs (couldn't she have shared her feelings about her newfound love in a more tender and less hurtful way?).  2) She found Tom too anxious, but is now with a similar albeit more secure partner.<br /><br />But really, what this means is that the new sucker who fell for her - who is clearly more tolerant of her avoidance tendencies than Tom - is still going to have to deal with her issues and inconsistencies through the years anyway, possibly to a breaking point.  Maybe writer Scott Neustadter was trying to offer an olive branch to the woman on whom he based the Summer character, and maybe he - like many anxious types - guiltily assumed he shared equal blame when his relationship failed.  But it's an enormous mistake to send such a message to the audience.<br /><br />In the end, the anxious types really do have the legs up over the avoidants.  Why?  Because anxious types, like Tom, despite having formed insecure attachments, still believe in love and the power of connection.  They have more room to grow, are more willing to grow, and if given a safe set of circumstances are willing to do The Work.  The avoidants, like Summer, don't want to do The Work, and barring a life-catastrophe (which they are most likely to experience eventually as a result of their avoidance behaviors), are much more comfortable sticking with their old scripts than they are with inviting the pain necessary to break free and live a life that runs in accordance with their true essence.<br /><br />Toward the end of the film we watch Tom experience the pain of wrestling free of his old illusions about love.  He suffers his way to catharsis.  Tom's failed relationship with Summer acts as the catalyst for exiting the old script.  When he quits the greeting card company he finally rejects the old romantic love songs and movies, re-invests in his true love of architecture, and takes a chance on asking out a woman without projecting any expectations on her.  The ability to act as such involved a great deal of prior work, discomfort, and courage, but the result is that a lifetime's worth of unhealthy behaviors are now extinguished.<br /><br />There is no evidence that Summer's new relationship - or her time with Tom - led her to do the same.  She's still an evolving wreck, and the viewer needs to better understand this when the movie ends.  She tells Tom she has accepted the idea of love, and that he played a role in transforming her thought process, but I can't imagine that this transition could have occurred so quickly and easily. My guess is that Summer still has a lot of work to do to move past the associations she has lived with for years as a result of her parents' divorce.<br /><br />Clearly both these individuals benefited as a result of being in each others' lives, but only Tom grabbed the oncoming train and soared into his future.  The anxious and avoidant types both had it wrong, but only the anxious type worked after-the-fact to make things right.  Anxious types may hold the sparkling snow too tight, but the avoidants turn the snow into a snowball and hurl it at anyone who dares to break down their walls.<br /><br />So on a less analytical and more heartfelt note, I loved the movie.  Yes, it's a romantic comedy, but it's Hemingway-esque sad, with 90% of the emotion weeping beneath the surface.  It's sad when relationships don't work out.  It's sad when people enter our world, make an impact, and then leave.  It's sad that we can't stay close to all those we loved, all who loved us, and all who have ever mattered in our lives.<br /><br />The film rang true because I had my own Tom-Summer experience, and scene after scene felt like a mosaic of intertwined frames from my own life.  The unexpected bursts of affection, the trying to impress her with music while she doesn't even seem to notice, the checking thecell phone in the middle of the night, the waiting patiently for the moment she will finally come around, the complete exhaustion at being forced to live between the gap of the expectations and the reality... Ugh.<br /><br />It's good to be reminded that we are not alone in our experiences.  Others make the same foolish mistakes that we do in the game of love, and it's easy to lose sight of common sense when the heart is plunged in the depths.  We are reminded that we can still have a sense of humour about it all and that hearts really do heal.  Well, most of the time anyway.<br /><br />The soundtrack is great too.  So are the quirky cultural references - Pac-Man, Henry Miller, The Smiths, and a dog named after Bruce Springsteen.  All are intelligently presented and not wrought with intellectual and cultural self-consciousness.  The non-linear narrative is cleverly delivered, the acting performances from all parties are strong, and the \\"You Make My Dreams Come True\\" sequence is one of the funniest I have ever seen on film.  I also appreciate that amidst the lighter moments, the film is not afraid to take itself seriously.  Maybe too many people suffer from Bono-fatigue, but these days too many artists go out of their way to poke a hole in the seriousness of their work so as to earn the \\"s/he doesn't take him/herself too seriously\\" moniker.  This film is brave.  It is serious, and it takes itself seriously when it needs to.<br /><br />So, I didn't assign this film five stars, primarily because I save five stars for films of unparalleled impact, but also because I didn't completely buy parts of the ending.  Nevertheless, this one's a gem.  We are treated to great directing, great writing, great acting, and a lot to think about.  *Five Hundred Days of Summer* and the implications of those early 34 seconds are well worth the 95 minute journey.

B0047HOXGY|5.0|This is the first Helloween album I have purchased and I find it to be excellent. It is hard to find good metal these days without the cookie monster vocals that have become all too common, but I think this album fits the bill nicely. It reminds me of the Iced Earth album Framing Armageddon, which has a similar sound in my opinion, and which I also like. If you like this album, I would also recommend Framing Armageddon. Hopefully the next album will continue in the same fashion as 7 Sinners and the band will tour the United States.
0439023513|3.0|I wont go into great detail as some of the other low-star reviews have, but I think Suzanne Collins really dropped the ball on this book, and frankly started to lose her creative grasp midway through Catching Fire.<br /><br />To be fair, the series WAS intended for a \\"young adult\\" audience; i.e. teenagers. I'm a 30 year old man and I expected a much stronger follow-up to the Hunger Games, which was almost perfectly crafted.<br /><br />Overall, it wasn't a terrible book. The following issues however did detract from the enjoy-ability of the book and the trilogy as a whole.<br /><br />1. Katniss never gets any redemption or completion of her character<br /><br />For 90% of the book, Katniss is wallowing in misery and drug-induced hallucinations. The thing that stood out to me about her in this installment is that she is always the VICTIM. Katniss is constantly reacting and rarely ACTING of her own accord, save for a few rebellious moments. She is a victim of the Capitol, a victim of 13, a victim of Coin, a victim of Haymitch, Gale, and even Peeta. We never get to see her rise from her drawn-out catatonic breakdowns and MATURE as a character, or start being more decisive.<br /><br />2. Gale, and many other supporting characters, are one-dimensional.<br /><br />Gale is essentially the same shade of grey throughout the entire book. Yeah, he is darker than before, but we never get to see him develop as an actual person we can relate to on some level. He is always there, but never really there. Collins could have killed him off and I would have felt nothing. I felt similarly about the other victors, Coin, and Katniss' mother. Finnick was the only one I could relate to, but his death was just a blur that never really got addressed.<br /><br />3. The action in the second half is rushed, confusing, and used as filler.<br /><br />Collins can write great action. But Mockingjay was not her best work. There were several parts I had to re-read to put together exactly what happened, and even then there were unanswered questions. The war scenes, while brutal and violent, were rushed and the reader never really gets a chance to \\"breathe\\" after them and process what is happening. Some of the 'pods' were poorly imagined or described, and Collins would simply skip over days of content when it seemed she just didn't feel like fleshing out the story. It is clear throughout Mockingjay that she just wanted---or needed---to finish the book.<br /><br />4. Poor climax and finish.<br /><br />It wasnt the events themselves----those were interesting, if not a bit predictable. It was the way she glossed over Prim's death, drew out Katniss' 100th meltdown, and just sketched the events that followed. Collins could have made a MUCH bigger impact by being more articulate about these final events and timing her delivery better. Instead, it was lost in the blur of days, weeks, months (we never really know), and stopping with a fairly uninspired return to district 12. The epilogue wasnt bad---vague, yes---but not a total letdown. What detracted from the ending was that Katniss never completed her character path or gets any real resolution. We are just left with a functionally numb adult woman who married Peeta because she had no one else to choose. She says she loved him, yes, but we dont get the sense that Katniss made her own CHOICE. She just gave in to him.<br /><br />This book did have some highlights and what I liked about it was that it did not sugar-coat the reality of war. Not everything happens for the greater good. The outcome of war isnt a glorious celebration; it's death, ashes, and a cessation of killing, only to usher in a different shade of corruption. You could say that is the central theme of the book--the starkness of war-- and in that Collins did alright. But as far as the tempo, delivery, and depth of her characters, Collins rushed this work and it shows.

B006CHML4I|5.0|Can't go wrong with this timepiece if you are reading this review. Obviously, it is not a big expensive watch, but the price should tell you that. Putting that aside, what unbelievable quality and beauty from a watch under $100, and automatic 21-jewel movement as well!<br /><br />This is a fantastic everyday watch, it's not heavy, bulky, hard to read, or overly flashy. At the same time, the brushed casing and royal blue coloring on the watch face and matching band look great with almost any outfit combination. As I said in the subject, simply great value for money.
0783225857|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird was an outstanding book which -- unlike some less fortunate books -- was made into an outstanding movie. Gregory Peck won an Academy Award for his superb performance as southern lawyer, Atticus Finch, who controversially defends a black man unjustly accused of molesting a white girl. Peck, a consistently fine actor, has frankly stated that this was his favorite role, and his performance is one of the most outstanding even given on film. Although Peck was clearly the star of this movie, the various other actors -- including those portraying his two children -- were also quite good and helped make this one of the greatest movies ever made.

B00003CXCD|5.0|Roman Holiday was Audrey Hepburn's first major role. Gregory Peck, a top tier movie veteran -- who initially was scheduled for solo top billing -- was so impressed with Hepburn's debut performance that he insisted that she be given equal billing with him. This act by Peck turned out to be not only gentlemanly but also very smart when Hepburn won an Academy Award for her performance. Roman Holiday is a genuine classic of the first order and a must see movie for fans of both Peck and Hepburn.

B005D4Y522|3.0|After the recent deluge of Mahler recordings, it is nice to see conductors and labels returning to Beethoven. And for the most part, the cycles from Vanska, Jarvi, and Chailly have proved that there is still much to be said about these works. Thielemann's cycle with the Vienna Philharmonic, however, is another story.  The first words that come to mind after listening to this set are self indulgent. Thielemann is an honest, earnest musician and he deeply believes in his cause. But that is the problem - this is not an interpretation of Beethoven as much as is it a homage to Furtwangler with Beethoven simply as the conduit. The typical cavalcade of boring and predictable Furtwanglerian elements are on parade here - big, Teutonic tutti sections, ritardandos at cadence figures, and flexible tempos.<br /><br />And these elements lead to predictable issues. Ensemble problems abound. Take, for example, the first tutti outburst in the Ninth's allegro, which finds the brass bumbling about completely off-tempo. Or listen to the beginning of the development in the Seveth's finale, Thielemann's huge tempo gear shift resulting in some uncomfortable ensemble work. Tension also sags due to Thielemann's posturing. The allegro of the Eroica is really a non-event at almost twenty minutes due to some excessively slow tempo choices. The same movement in the Eighth is equally uneventful, especially as Thielemann overworks the harmonic transitions in the second theme group. And in the Fifth's finale, Thielemann's tempo adjustments rob the music of its sense of forward momentum. That is not to say that this set is the disaster we got from Rattle or Pletnev. The First and the Second generate some excitement here and there and the Pastorale has some truly beautiful string and horn sonorities.<br /><br />Still, at the end the day, both interpretively and sonically, we have better choices. Period Instrument Specialists and HIPster will just become enraged by Thielemann's aesthetic and should stick to Jarvi and Gardiner. Fans of the German school have Wand and Blomstedt. And those that want orchestral perfection have Szell and Vanska. If you want the Vienna Philharmonic, turn to Bohm, who generates more tension, better playing, and is far more interpretively secure. For those that like Furtwangler's way with Beethoven might as well turn to the original source but can turn with confidence to Barenboim's fantastic cycle with the Berliner Staatskappelle. Barenboim, like Thielemann, idolizes Furtwangler but still manages to maintain his interpretive independence. Here, with this set, Thielemann just sounds old-fashioned.<br /><br />Finally, on a consumer note, this set is unappealing because the three named symphonies are all housed on individual discs but we still get no fillers. This is especially troubling when compared to Chailly's set, which contains eight of the eleven overtures of five CDs. The linen booklet cover is just putting lipstick on a pig. Avoid unless you love Furtwangler.

0312576463|5.0|This works a lot slower than Franzen's last novel, in large part because he spends so much time shaping out the backgrounds of each one of these people in a way that even a book as rich as the corrections didn't quite manage. I felt almost addicted to the Lamberts and their collective trainwreck from the first chapter. With the Berglunds, it took time, because Franzen takes his time. He builds the characters here organically and holistically, showing each of them at their most compassionate and selfless and most spiteful and nihilistically selfish in turn. This doesn't lend itself to instant readerly gratification, but it does mean that once your really into this world, you are completely locked into it. And what a painfully familiar, often emotionally wrenching world it is. The basic, inescapable problem of 'what do I want' vs 'what do the people I care about want' is anatomized with trenchant political commentary, acerbic satire, a therapeutic autobiography, sleezy neo-con iraqi reconstruction schemes, indie rock, bird watching, sex, and a healthy dose of north american geographic desolation. If 'The corrections' is a few lines of cocaine, 'Freedom' is a full-on heroin addiction, it builds up on you slowly.

031603441X|4.0|I usually don't touch celebrity \\"written with...\\" memoirs with a ten foot pole (color me snooty), but I'm glad I picked this up. The tone, the incredible, sparkling voice that Richards and Fox create makes this such a lively read, and the level of detail here is really staggering; he seems to remember more about his life, especially his working class, post-war British youth (which he describes lovingly without resorting to cheap nostalgia) than most people who haven't been addicted to heroin and casually using cocaine and drinking heavily for decades at a stretch. That's another thing which makes this refreshing, Too often memoirs seem like they are written as a sort of cheap catharsis, a desire to make some kind of amends, especially for bad behavior. I for one found it oddly heartening that Richards is so utterly unapologetic about his lifestyle (which is not quite but very nearly as bad as the mythos would have us believe, it was only pharmaceutical cocaine kids!). In an age when public repentance has become little more than a cheap, ritualized side-show (thank you, Oprah and Dr. Phil) it's bracing to know that someone who seems like an obvious candidate for it patently rejects and shuns it when giving us a glimpse of his personal life. Maybe that makes Keith Richards a total jerk, but the other thing that comes across here is how musically passionate of a jerk he is. I've never been a die-hard stones fan, but if this account is to be believed, then Richards is not just a member of the rolling stones but in many respects its animating musical force over the decades.<br />If nothing else it's worth reading for these incredibly timed, dead-pan one liners, which actually made me laugh out loud at several points. \\"Everything was full of dope\\" \\"Charlie punched Mick out the window\\" etc

0679731725|4.0|Even for a book about a Butler, this is almost suffocatingly British. Stevens is prim and proper almost to the point of being ludicrous. If it wasn't for the occasional glimmer of emotion and regret beneath the ocean of restraint, tradition, and suffocating class distinctions, this book would be unbearable. And yet how much more palpable those brief moments of private doubt feel because they occur so rarely and come about so simplistically in an otherwise completely regimented existence. Unlike other novels about someone having wasted their entire life, I have to give this real credit for not devolving into a self-indulgent pity party. Stevens is who he is, and it often isn't clear if his uber-primness is the source of his sorrows or just the most effective way of dealing with them, or both. If nothing else, Ishiguro deserves big credit for realizing that what is best and worst in people is often hopelessly conflated, and not something you can casually isolate and cure at will. Read it while sipping a cup of tea on a rainy afternoon for full melancholic effect.
B005HEWO6W|5.0|I love Voyager.  Watch this show, especially if you like Science Fiction.  I believe that the writers drew upon an idea from Star Trek: The Animated Series (TAS).  The Episode \\"One of Our Planets Is Missing\\" is about a cloud nebula type lifeform.<br /> I give credit to the writers for expanding upon this idea and bringing it to the screen.  We also get the first running of the Sandrine (which I'd like to see in Las Vegas next to Quarks).  There is so much packed into this, that it's a must see for Season 1, and a Full Tribute fully worthy of the name: Trek.  5/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin'<br /><br />...\\"A-koo-chee-moya.

0380789035|2.0|The concept at work here is really delightful, Gaiman has a real talent for weaving an incredibly rich mythological tapestry out of disparate pantheons and folklores, especially when it comes to showing how the shifts and fragmentations of American culture have affected such a fanciful background. And as a Midwesterner, I can't not appreciate someone setting a fantasy in and around the sorts of small, forgotten, desolate towns I grew up around. That being said, the main action of the story feels really rushed and underdeveloped. He just keeps on piling this huge, seemingly cosmically significant events and cryptic ruminations, and just as quickly dismisses them and moves on. Granted, a lot of the characters in this book are, literally, Gods. As such, conventional notions of characterization might just not apply. But if your going to make a bunch of deities into characters and have them be central to the story, it might help if they seem to actually want something more then to just spout off trite profundities and whine about the good old days when they drank the blood and prayers of their sacrifices.

1401232590|5.0|This is an incredibly strong comic. You've got this really great story which is really grounded not by the usual players in the Batman universe but by the bit characters, Wives, Henchmen, female mafiosi etc to show how hard it must be to have to live in this environment. It thrives on these little mundane moments and interactions, drawing them out to show a level of depth which is just really refreshing. And the art work is just gorgeous, incredibly stylized and deeply cinematic, the panels unfold with an almost palpable grandeur. This isn't just a good comic, it's good mystery writing. This is the sort of comic that will convince people who don't like reading comics about how rich the Batman mythos is

0802130208|5.0|Wow, this is a funny, funny book. Ignatius j. Reilly is one of the most fully realized characters I think I'll ever come across. Toole's sense of dialogue is spot on, every exchange sparkles with this maniacal sort of wit, and unlike many authors, he actually makes the regional dialects of the south work in a way which reinforces the characters instead of just frustrating the reader. It's a wild, carnivalesque affair with the local color of a Twain or Dickens novel, but ratcheted up to the nth degree. Watch out for them comuniss!

B0069GRIHW|5.0|THE ORDER WAS EASY TO DO. THE CD CAME QUICKLY. THE ORIGINAL MUSIC WAS GOOD SOUNDS FROM THE \\"DOORS\\".  THE ALTERNATE VERSIONS ADDED A NEW TWIST TO THE DOORS SOUND,WITH VERY SUTTLE CHANGES. I PLAY IT WHILE WALKING THE TREADMILL, IT IS PLAYED AT THE RIGHT TEMPO FOR A NICE WALKING SPEED FOR ME,AND I LIKE THE MUSIC. WHAT DO I KNOW? I WAS A TEEN WHEN THIS STULL WAS NEW AND STILL LIKE IT.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Yes, I mistakenly bought the \\"version 1\\" (serial # ending with BIR1 on the center of the back of the disc), and, yes, had to return it for the correct \\"remastered, version 2\\" (serial # ending with BIR2 on the center of the back of the disc), so I could definitely see the difference leaving the film grain in makes.  BIR1 looked glassed-over, and, as another reviewer pointed out, you could see most of the flaming arrows flying off against the Germans in the majestic long shot pan in the beginning.  Thankfully, the remastered version 2 restores all the film grain, grit and detail to Ridley Scott's seminal masterpiece.  Version 2 looks better than the film did in cinemas, with deeper blacks and more rich colors.  I only wish there was something on the labelling of the box that delineated which version we were about to buy, so we didn't have to take it home and play it to find out, to have to return it if it's the wrong version!  But, bravo, Paramount and DreamWorks!
0312117337|4.0|I only recently acquired and began using this deck, partly because I already owned many other decks and didn't want to have to learn a new one.  The names on the cards often don't match the names in the Waite-Smith tradition, so I was concerned that I would have to learn a whole new system of interpretation.  Once I got the deck and started using it, however, I was quite impressed.  The art work is quite beautiful for the most part. (In any deck there are always some cards that are not appealing.)  Because I know the Waite-Smith deck quite well, the interpretations of the equivalent cards in this deck turned out to add a depth of understanding to what I already knew.<br /><br />For those who are considering getting this deck, I would recommend going the the OSHO site online which has an OSHO tarot option.  There you can see the cards and read the accompanying text.  You can also do online tarot readings with this deck at that site.  It's a good way to judge whether this deck will appeal to you and be useful in your readings.  It's important to read the book that accompanies this deck because it explains the artist's choice of symbols and how the cards related to concepts from Zen Buddhism.<br /><br />A couple things I did not like about the cards (though for the most part I really fancy them):  The use of the name \\"schizophrenia\\" bothers me because I work with schizophrenic patients and find this use of the term to be shallow and insensitive to people who suffer from that illness.  In addition, I showed the cards to a Jewish friend who felt that the \\"Miser\\" card drew on the old stereotypic image of Shakespeare's Shylock, which is offensive to the many in the Jewish community.  Also, the \\"we are the world\\" card seems trite and reminds me too much of Disneyland.<br /><br />These objections aside, I do recommend this deck, especially if your are intrigued by Zen.<br /><br />Addendum: Having used the deck for a while, I find it is better for reflection and meditation than for regular readings.  It tends to \\"accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative\\" a bit too much.  I still like it, but the deck is beginning to feel rather New Agey, saccharine, and goody-two-shoes.

B0073PZIYI|2.0|The concept behind this film is a fascinating one, but sadly, the film disappoints.<br /><br />Gaping plot holes make this movie hard to take seriously. The passage of time is utterly unrealistic, with characters repeatedly running distances of several hundred yards in mere seconds. A nearly two-hour sprint is not enough to cause one of the characters to break a sweat.<br /><br />Poor dialogue causes frequent chuckling throughout serious scenes. As an example, in one scene, after a few minutes of running together, one character stops, says \\"follow me to the other,\\" then resumes running.<br /><br />The acting is not strong, but it isn't laughable. Quite frankly, I expected worse out of Justin Timberlake, but he held up okay in this role. (Don't expect Oscars in the near future, however.)<br /><br />The movie's redeeming points are its concept and how it encourages the viewer to consider how they would choose to behave with only a day to live. Overall, however, I had a hard time justifying even the dollar or two I spent to rent this one.
1582701709|5.0|I watched the movie and I loved it, so I ordered the book. I really enjoyed the concept, I always been a pretty happy person but after my brother died I was so depressed. After reading the book I realized living your life feeling sorry for yourself and feeling like a victim is not the way to go. I feel so much better and I only want to be around positive people. If I ever have children I will definately teach them the law of attraction and positive thinkin!
B000ICLRHK|2.0|For some reason Speed seems to be above criticism. It doesn't deserve this regard. I've never liked this film, and for a long list of reasons. I remember clearly the summer of 1994 when it became a sleeper hit. 'Die Hard on a bus' they called it. Erm...no. More like 'The Poseidon Adventure on a bus'.<br /><br />Everybody knows the story by now, which is the sign of a high-concept idea. But I'm not captured by it. A bomb threat on a yuppie elevator ends with the bomber apparently blowing himself up in the parking lot. The LAPD cannot allow the yuppies to fall a breathtaking one-foot per second into the basement (it honestly moves at this 'speed' with none of them affected by zero-gravity). The bomber claims he invested 3 years into this plan, but overnight he conjures-up a better plan (all with just a single oppose-able thumb) in which a bus will blow up if it falls below 50 mph.<br /><br />Half-witted cop Jack Traven races to the rescue. But instead of blowing-out the bus's tires he simply yells at the driver to stop. He doesn't. Once on-board they barge through traffic jams, hard corners, magically jump over 50-foot gaps (launched by invisible ramps it seems), and argue among themselves. The passengers are an undynamic bunch of cardboard cut-outs (burly worker in hat, long-faced African woman, whiny old crone, unemployed bachelor, geeky tourist) who never once get our sympathies. Many of them don't even have any dialogue and just sit there as if the threat of being blown to smithereens is a daily occurrence. Also, if I were Jack Traven, I'd put a bullet in the head of that annoying Helen before she even got a chance to draw air into her lungs in order to make her first complaint.<br /><br />Directed by former cinematographer Jan De Bont (who is actually responsible for making Die Hard look as good as it does), it's a high-key movie (to the point of almost being sterile) with lots of destruction and well-choreographed action, but he has no idea how to direct actors or build character. Between the action scenes there are painful lulls which are not helped by the frequently awful dialogue and poor writing.<br /><br />Perhaps I should say poor re-writing. Though Graham Yost is the only credited writer the script was significantly re-written by Joss Whedon, who made many changes. Originally the bomber was revealed to be Jeff Daniels' character, but after Whedon created Howard Payne the character of Harry Temple became redundant by the end of the second act and he's needlessly killed off. Other elements of the original draft are fossilized into the story and give it an irregular flow. There are so many other contrivances and lazy explanations that I just can't forgive. Jack Traven realizes that there is a camera on the bus when Payne refers to Sandra Bullock as 'the wildcat', despite the fact that the ancient camera Payne has hooked up inside the vehicle has nowhere near enough resolution to make out the Wildcat logo on her jacket (which she is also leaning against).<br /><br />Keanu Reeves' acting is so bad it makes Seagal look like Olivier. Don't get me wrong, I like Keanu, but he's excruciatingly awful in this film. His puzzling facial expressions and just plain bizarre pronunciation of certain words gives Jack Traven (already an unlikeable character) a semi-retarded edge. I longed for Payne to get away with it.<br /><br />Apparently Vic Armstrong was up for directing this but the producers went for Jan De Bont because of his lengthy camera credits. The success of the film is purely down to star power and its high concept. It's nothing to do with De Bont's ability as a director (which is why he hasn't worked since 2003) and I know that Armstrong would have made a better movie, even if he was stuck with Keanu (who he worked with a year later on notorious flop Johnny Mnemonic ), who couldn't even act ill if he had the flu.<br /><br />Speed is not a good film. It's a badly-written early 90s relic. I just cannot even begin to understand the adoration its gathered over the years.<br /><br />The Blu Ray presents the film in a nice, clean, if unspectacular 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are a bunch of extras ported over from the ancient DVD.tand the adoration its gathered over the years.<br /><br />The Blu Ray presents the film in a nice, clean, if unspectacular 2.35:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound.

1612130283|5.0|I have never read a book like this one. I was caught up from the first chapter. You can love him/hate him but I've never been so enthralled with a character like Christian. I read the whole trilogy this weekend. I literally didn't move off my couch (except to take the dog out and use the bathroom). You will either love these books or hate them - I don't think there is any \\"middle ground\\".

B006OKOZGU|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock would be thrilled to see how beautiful and vibrant his film appears on Blu ray! The picture is crisp and the colors are vibrant! I can hardly wait to see his other films like, Rear Window, The Birds and other color films to receive the Blu ray treatment. North By Northwest had already been released and is an exceptional transfer. As was Psycho, in rich black & white tones that make it a joy to watch!<br /><br /> I am so happy to see the wonderful films of Alfred Hitchcock receiving this treatment. His earlier works, Rebecca, Notorious & Spellbound have also been put to Blu ray but, i personally have not yet seen them.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book was good, great when I first read it but now it seems silly. From the very beginning I was hooked, and every chapter ended with me wanting more. The concept is fun and different from anything else Ive seen or read minus a short story I read in high school about a man being hunted on an island. But looking back, something is missing. There seems to be a lack of depth to the characters; and the heroine's cold, selfish attitude is so annoying. Also much of it seemed predictable and unrealistic. Its not a bad read though. There are some enjoyable moments that touched me to the core plus other friends deemed this an awesome read. I liked the 1st book more than the 2nd & 3rd. The 2nd seemed repetitive and the 3rd dragged on slowly in the first half. I would not call it a waste of time, because it was entertaining. But it just isnt the best book on the \\"e-shelf\\".
B006DDU850|5.0|The book is really awesome. I had given up on Stephen King sometime ago, just lost interest, but this book has made me a fan again.  I am listening to the audio (three MP3 audios) so it's not a short book but boy is it good!
B006IMY5ZU|2.0|Moneyball, the book, was about the application of statistics to baseball management. The subject connects with gamblers, would be gamblers, sports fans in general, and (I suppose) econometricians. It was great if you like that kind of stuff, but there's really nothing in that volume you can put on a screen. Nothing.<br /><br />From beginning to end, the movie searches for sources of dramatic tension. Few of them are in the book; all of them fall short. It tries to buttress the threadbare and desultory plot line with character development that is... threadbare and desultory. I don't know what they paid for the rights, but 80% of what they got was the title and its associated good will.<br /><br />In the end it wasn't terrible. It just wasn't good.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have just read the first installment only in \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy. So this is just based on the first book.  I started it last evening around 8 and barely put it down until I finished it today around 2pm.  It was very good.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and have already purchased the second book in the series to start tonight.  That being said, I am concerned that the target audience is middle schoolers and teens.  This is definitely not a book that I would allow my tween or young teen read and it bothers me that I have read that it is required reading in some 7th grade classes.  There are many better choices in classical literature for kids.

B00479SVBU|5.0|Is it hyperbole to call this the coolest electronic device ever made for the Car? I think not.<br /><br />I was recently wishfully shopping some car stereo stores and models of stereos, [installed], that could be fitted to my car and that had either/or/both 3.5 mm plug and USB port. Well they started around $250 and went up into the thousands. Yikes ! It was then I found the Soundfly AUX. First off, all the accolades given the Satechi people are well deserved. I had 2 phone conversations and 1 e mail with them before even purchasing and got the right answer every time.<br /><br />Now to this $45 wonder. I began by taking others words that each storage option would take a maximum of 99 folders, and as I consider each album a folder that left me loading A - L on the SD card, [[ASIN:B003VNKNEG Transcend 8 GB Class SDHC 10 Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC10E]] {I CANNOT tell you what difference there is between a Class 6 or Class 10 or even Class 4 in this application - went with the 10 myself}, and M - Z on the USB Drive,[[ASIN:B0051G5SBY HP v165 8 GB USB Flash Drive P-FD8GBHP165-AZ]] {I really like this HP USB Drive, it hardly sticks out at all}, which put 89 albums on the Card and 79 on the stick. Both were only 8 GB but plenty for my needs. You could have a 32 GB card and have one folder that had like 10,000 songs in it I suppose, but it would be a real bear to search. {FYI - Satechi says to use FAT32 format for storage.}<br /><br />I went in and copied all my music to an external drive, {Thanks Sis}, and reorganized them into 2 files of alphabetical order. {I used the WMA format but MP3 is fine too.}  I also took the \\"A's\\" and \\"The's\\" off album titles to make it as clean and readable as possible.  Then I went to a site called, \\"Radio Locator\\", to find the clearest frequency to set the transmitter to - and off I went. {This is the first transmitter I've seen that you can set to any point on the FM dial, not just a few select ones.}<br /><br />A couple of quick \\"Con\\" notes. Use the bookmark-remote often. As many have said, you need to be right on top of the device with the remote, like an inch,, but if you're listening to an Album and you hit a pothole that breaks the connection for a second, when the whole thing resets it will go to your last bookmark, even if it was days ago. When using the bookmark button you have to use it twice. Once to clear the last bookmark and once again to set a new one. When you scroll through your folders and get to the end you cannot keep going in the same direction to get back to the start. You must reverse direction and go through all of them again to reach the beginning. The buttons are small and some of the functions are a little hard to get used to, and when you're visually searching if you pause for more than a few seconds the screen will go back to \\"Now Playing\\" mode and you'll have to begin again, and it really would be nice to have a locking \\"OFF\\" switch so it didn't start up every time you turn on the ignition, . . . All small gripes compared to a greater sense of pure musical freedom.<br /><br />WOW ! I now have all the music I own ready and waiting to be played in my car with a sound quality that is past good. If you fiddle with both sets of controls enough to find the sweet spot where the Car radio meets up with the Soundfly AUX, the sound is extraordinary! Hard to imagine it being even better if you have the direct 3.5 mm connection in your car's stereo.<br /><br />My stereo isn't a BOSE or anything, - an entry level Kenwood I had put in the car some years back and factory standard speakers, [Red Honda CRV], but the sound I'm able to get out of this little thing is huge. {I gotta say, I'm probably the guy you hate when you pull up next to me at a light. I like to listen loud, and lots of my music is older than you are; Quicksilver, Yes, Allman Brothers Live, Small Faces, Fever Tree - so you get the picture - but there is still space left on this nifty little device for Vavaldi, Firesign Theater, and The Legendary Big Band Singers with room for more.} A lot of this music is very nuanced but this Soundfly AUX seems to bring out all the Tones and Thunder that I know is there in the songs. It's hard to tell that it's not a CD. {O K - MAYBE the bass is a little muddy on some album's mix, but not often and if you want to re-mix the High, Low, and Mid in both the Soundfly and your Stereo for every album, you could probably clean that up too.}  When you hit the pause button the speakers are whisper quiet - no background noise or interference - nor have I ever noticed any fade or cross noise as I travel across town. Should somebody break in and steal the thing I can replace it and all my music for $65 - $70, with much less effort than burning 200 CD's.<br /><br />Need a rental car or going on that RV trip?  Throw this in a coat pocket and all your music goes with you.  Swap out the SD Card or USB Stick and even your, {gulp}, kid's collection can come along.<br /><br />I choose to keep the device plugged in all the time as the weakest point in the overall construction seems to me to be the spring loaded wings that hold it into the lighter receptacle. It's not that they are weak - to the contrary - they take a good deal of effort to insert or remove. It's a very good design, but I can see that after a few hundred in-and-out's the springs would get weaker, the receptacle more worn, and there would be a good deal of wear and tear on all the plastic parts as well. You also gotta wonder how well your lighter socket was attached in the first place. It probably was not designed for such pressure mounts, {these are much stronger than the wimpy little springs on the sides of your phone car charger}, - and like I said - even a pothole can jar a brand new one loose from time to time.<br /><br />Hang a trash bag off the dash as camouflage - done and ready whenever I want.<br /><br />Thank you Satechi.ater, and The Legendary Big Band Singers with room for more.} A lot of this music is very nuanced but this Soundfly AUX seems to bring out all the Tones and Thunder that I know is there in the songs.

1400032717|4.0|Christopher is fifteen years old. He is intelligent and logical, good with numbers, he dislikes the colours yellow and brown and, above all, wants to know who murdered his next-door neighbour's dog Wellington with a garden fork.<br /><br />The story follows Christopher as he looks for Wellington's murderer and his role as a detective is assisted by his clear, logical mind, and hindered by the people who don't want him to discover the truth. But, as the mystery is unravelled, it becomes clear that the matter concerns him more directly than he had at first thought.<br /><br />Well, what a wonderful story this is! Beautifully written in first person from Christopher's point of view, it's not really about the murder mystery - at heart it's a fascinating look into the mind a very strange boy. I have no idea whether it's an authentic depiction of a real mind but it rings very true. And, if it is, so much becomes clear. Externally, Christopher's autism* makes him seem like a very strange, dispassionate person, but that impression is the direct result of the workings of a very logical, dispassionate mind on a few simple premises. So, for instance, Christopher doesn't like the colour yellow because of double yellow lines (which works for me!) and bananas (which also turn brown and brown is a bad colour because of poo). He likes curry because it has a strong flavour but he doesn't like curry because it is yellow. If he adds red food colouring to curry then he can eat it! QED (which means Quod Erat Demonstrandum, which means \\"that is what was to be proved\\")!  I'm not expressing it at all well but, suddenly, a very alien behaviour becomes just a little bit comprehensible. That alone makes this a valuable and deeply absorbing book, for adults AND younger readers.<br /><br />\\"This is not a funny book\\" Christopher warns us at the beginning, but it /is/ funny. The humour is, from Christopher's perspective, unintentional (and probably unnoticed) and, again, it originates in his precise, literal thought process and his utter lack of pretence. So, the name \\"Christopher\\" comes from \\"To carry Christ\\" because Saint Christopher carried Christ over a river. So, he wonders, what was  Saint Christopher called before he carried Christ over a river? The question would never have occurred to me and its simplicity and clarity made me laugh out loud, as did so many other passages and revelations. That nicely offsets the heartbreaking poignancy of other aspects of the story bt on those I shall remain silent for fear of giving too much away.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Curious Incident\\" is a masterpiece of engaging, revelatory storytelling and everyone should read it**.<br /><br />Very highly recommended indeed.<br /><br />* I am now aware that there is some considerable debate as to whether Christopher is autistic, has Aspergers or is in some other way affected.

B003U0AHBO|1.0|On the one hand, the character of Robin Hood cannot truly be known since he is really an amalgam of many outlaws created during 1200 AD - 1300 AD, 100 years of social and political unrest in England.  Not only that, but the characters so dear to the retelling of the story, such as Maid Marian and Jolly Friar Tuck were introduced as add-ons through the cultural retelling of the story during May Day games over many hundreds of years thereafter.  As to even where Robin's hideout was, no one really knows.  Some say West Yorkshire, others say Sherwood Forest.<br /><br />What I objected to mostly was the fabrication of a \\"definitive\\" plotline against the backdrop of an unknowable history and then, contorting history to place the French as the 'bad guys' when the English Normans were equally the protagonists during this era!  Somehow Robin gets swept up in the events of the time as an \\"archer\\", when historical accounts credit him to be a \\"yeoman\\" and not necessarily in the service of any king.  That he is supposedly a son of a stonemason adduces additional stretching of the truth.<br /><br />Far from being historically accurate, the movie draws bold lines where gray would be closer to the truth.  Richard, as Duke of Normandy went WITH Philip II to campaign against Saladin during the Third Crusade.  Philip actually favored the princes Richard and John initially, in order to get them on his side against their father, Henry II.  Philip then retired from the Crusade, leaving his troops under the authority of Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy.  The rift between Philip and Richard was actually caused by a woman, Alys, Philip's sister, whom Richard had broken off engagement to at Messina, prior to joining the Crusade.  Philip then campaigned to restore the Vexin and the fortress of Gisors by force, which was originally Alys' dowry to Richard.  William Marshal, in contrast with the movie, was never \\"dismissed\\" as seneschal but remained a loyal royal supporter both of Richard and John rather than going over to the barons.  Richard wasn't killed immediately after the Crusade but, being released from imprisonment in February, 1194, took 300 ships in May, 1194 to Normandy to attack Philip (the movie claims Philip attacked John by sea in England).  Richard was killed in 1199 as part of his reconquest of Normandy, which had nothing to do with the Crusade.<br /><br />It was actually not just baronial intrigue that generated the Magna Carta but King John's disastrous campaign at the river Lys, near the Bridge of Bovines in 1214 that sealed his fate in history and caused the ascendancy of the French king over the Norman vassals.  A better movie could have been made using the actual history (English Normans attacking the French to salvage their French landholdings) rather than reversing the flow of history (French attacking the English Normans) and attempting to interject Robin Hood as essential and pivotal to the outcome!  This movie is fantasy rather than reality and, created despite historical events offering a better plotline than what the writers' imagined and repackaged!her than going over to the barons.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is set in a time in which many books dealing with racial issues are not. It was unique in that way. The book has so many twists and turns and sometimes it's hard to keep up with who is who - but I fell in love with the many characters the author created. You don't expect what's coming. I would definitely recommend it. Great book!!!

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|This was a great adaptation of the books, and a fantastic show in its own right.  I got completely lost in the story and the characters, EXCEPT in a couple of spots.  Don't get me wrong, I like boobs as much as the next guy, but eventually the nudity in this show started seeming perfunctory. It's like you could hear the producer in the background saying to the writer \\"Yes, yes, good show, but our fans need to see a little bit of tit in every episode.  Where can you squeeze it in here?\\"<br /><br />Especially the scenes where Littlefinger is training whores in how to fake an orgasm.  Yeah, I get that it reveals some attributes of his character, but it was still felt somehow fake, and broke the immersion.  Ironically, that's exactly what Littlefinger was telling the whores about their sex technique.
0307949435|4.0|First of all, I really enjoy reading.  I read on a daily basis.  I bought and read Gary Taubes' book \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories\\"; and it took me longer to get through that book than it should have.  It was so full of case studies that the constant explanations of them caused me to go back and re-read several sections.  The simplicity of this book makes that other one seem like a textbook.  This one breaks it all down \\"Barney-style\\" and makes it enjoyable.  I'm not a slow person; I understood what Gary Taubes was trying to get at with his last book; it was just too scientific and technical.  This book, however, made me enjoy reading a book about diets.  It was definitely an easier read.

0316098329|5.0|This is a very moving and emotional novel that is going to stay with me for a long time. Imagine a five year old boy, Jack the protagonist of this shocking story, who believes that the 11 feet by 11 feet room that he and his mother live in is the entire world!  A harrowing thought indeed and Emma Donoghue has succeeded in writing a riveting novel that had me reading late into the night about this disturbing experience.<br /><br />Her imagination really takes you into the world of Room, where Jack was born and has lived his entire life with his mother. The bond between mother and son has been strong enough that they have survived five years, though you really wonder how as you get drawn into this dark story. They spend the days exercising, playing, reading, learning, watching television, eating and sleeping; somehow surviving this unimaginable life on the small Sunday treats their gaoler allows them! Although a strange life for Jack, because he knows no different it is normal, especially as he believes that nothing he sees on television is actually real.<br /><br />Room might be home to Jack but to his mother it has been a prison for seven years. As her son is growing up and becoming more curious about every aspect of their world, however limited it might be, she becomes more and more desperate about their situation. I am not going to reveal any more here for fear of spoiling it for any of you that may now be tempted to read this.
0446585025|1.0|I have read a lot of books by comedians especially women and this was by far the worst book that I have read!! I was extremely disappointed. It was like she had a book deal and had to write something. I couldn't believe that it was actually published!! Page 59 about the Haiku was seriously the most ridiculous filler, its sad that she put her name on this \\"work\\". This was pitiful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Summarizing my thoughts on the Hunger Games is probably one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do, simply because I've never felt such an emotional connection to any piece of fiction before and I highly doubt my written review will be doing it justice.<br /><br />North America has been completely eradicated and reborn as Panem, a bleak and twisted shadow of the nations it once comprised. Under the totalitarian regime of the Capitol, citizens are segregated into one of twelve districts, making equality and personal freedom a thing of the past. To further exude their absolute authority over the masses, the Capitol holds a spectacle of blood every year known as the Hunger Games. Every year, one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve to eighteen are picked randomly from each district to become tributes. They're then sent to the Capitol to be placed in a massive outdoor arena to fight to the death for the entertainment of all of Panem, and for the glory and benefit of the victor's district. For the denizens of District 12, poverty and the struggle for survival is their entire existence, no one understands this more than sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen. Ever since the tragic passing of her father, Katniss has tasked herself with the duty of supporting her mother and younger sister Prim. She does this by hunting on the forbidden grounds beyond District 12, and by trading her kills for other necessities. All of this changes when Prim is chosen against all odds to become a tribute for the Hunger Games. To save her sister, Katniss voluntarily becomes the tribute in her place. From there, she's whisked off to the Capitol alongside her fellow tribute and childhood acquaintance, Peeta. To survive the Hunger Games, it will take every ounce of skill, instinct, and intellect she can muster.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has a very distinct style that I've never quite seen realized before in fiction writing. Apart from her superb skill at world-building and strong characterization, it's her ability to emotionally connect the reader to the protagonist in the story. She understands how human beings naturally tend to sympathize with and form emotional attachments with people who are in a great deal of emotional trauma or physical pain. It's this intangible emotional bond with Katniss that Collins uses to effectively, and at times maliciously, pull you into her dreadful dystopia. I actually found reading the first few chapters of the Hunger Games to be difficult, not because it was bad god forbid, but because I found it to be emotionally disturbing. It's done so sadistically well that reading the Hunger Games becomes less of a desire and more of a necessity, you need to find out what happens next.<br /><br />Of course this emotional connection wouldn't be possible if the protagonist wasn't likable, fortunately that couldn't be farther from the truth. Katniss as a whole essentially personifies every character trait that teen novelists almost always try to avoid. She isn't some frail flower who requires a man to define herself as an individual. Nor is she bogged down to the now very cliché snarky heroine persona that we've seen a thousand times before. Yet she still manages to have a delightfully subtle sense of humor to prevent the book from becoming completely morose in its tone. But her greatest trait that I admire is her indomitable spirit. Even when suffering through a series of physical and psychological horrors induced upon her by the Capitol, she never loses her fire.<br /><br />Upon being dropped into the arena, the book drastically shifts in direction. No longer focusing on the contrived spectacle of the games and instead on the games itself. Gone are the pretty dresses, make-up, and gourmet dinners. It's a gritty, primal, and relentless struggle for survival. Collins really knows how to make a very fast paced narrative and it truly shows here. It also works in Collin's favor that Katniss isn't characterized as a cliche Hollywood bad-ass. We know she has the ingenuity, instincts, and skill-set to stand a chance at winning but she doesn't possess the mentality of a killer. This makes the notion of her becoming the victor not so far-fetched. But at the same time she always feel vulnerable thus adding precious tension and drawing us ever more into the urgent narrative that Collins so expertly weaves.<br /><br />Most people will without a doubt compare this novel to other books with similar plots like The Running Man and Battle Royale. But I personally like to compare this book to George Orwell's 1984, a book that also imagined a futuristic totalitarian dystopia. He succeeded in fully realizing his horrific vision of the future, but in my opinion it fell short due to the completely flat characters and boring plot. Never once did I ever feel like a part of his world, nor did I cringe at the thought of Big Brother's gaze shadowing my every move. I was an observer, not an inhabitant and thus the shock-value that was intended was lessened in its affect. The Hunger Game's dystopian future is much more immersive due to the aforementioned emotional connection the reader shares with Katniss, something I feel 1984 could never hope to achieve. It makes the ludicrous premise of the actual Hunger Games much more believable, and thus more despicable.<br /><br />There is also a romance sub-plot involving Katniss and Peeta. I had apprehension to this at first due to romances in teen novels portraying completely forced relationships between characters. Yet the Hunger Games not only avoids this pitfall, it actually manages to satire this stereotype in my eyes. In an interesting ploy, Peeta stages a romance with Katniss in the hopes of gaining the populace's favor in the Hunger Games. They've literally used the Capitol's regime of totalitarianism to deceive the masses and gain their favor. It's literally a contrived romance, yet at the same time this causes Katniss to ponder how much of it is truly deception, and if there's any sense of honesty to their relationship. But more importantly, if she can truly trust the boy who she is supposed to kill to survive. It's a very welcome change of pace from the typical love-struck schoolchildren succumbing to sheer sexual desire instead of a strong character-driven relationship. It's emotionally endearing unlike the typical cringe-worthy schlock written for the target teenage demographic.<br /><br />This is the first book that I've ever read out of hundreds that will truly stay in your thoughts and pull on your conscience. It's the exceptionally paced narrative, believable world-building in conjunction with such wonderfully realized characters that'll invest you in Katniss's painful tale. Like I said at the beginning, I've never read any book in my life that upon completion has had such an emotional effect on me, and I'm sure my words aren't doing it justice. I'll just finish this by saying Suzanne Collins has created a book that has left me entranced long after I'd reached the final page. It will truly consume you.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is a great movie. So far I watched it three times and every time I watch I notice something new and intriguing about a character, a set, or the dialogue. It's a total turn on, and never boring. The special items are great too. There's an interview with a group of the actors that's really insightful.

0761158820|4.0|I feel compelled after reading some of the other reviews to write a review of my own.  This book was a gift to my oldest 2 sons, age 10 and 6.  My 6 year old and his buddies are completely \\"into\\" the monster craze.  I thought my 10 YO would not enjoy this activity, thinking he was too old for it.  Instead, he and his brother had so much fun, it was wonderful to see them working together.  My 10 YO had no difficulty whatsoever in popping out the paper shapes and gluing them.  My 6 year old had some difficulty being patient for the glue to dry in between some of the gluing steps, but no problems other than that.  We simply reminded him from time to time that it was advantagious to give the glue a chance to set up, then continue on.  Our 4 year old son was even involved in popping out some of the monsters and he was quite successful!  This IS appropriate for younger kids, not just 14 years and up!  A couple of the designs are not well thought out and do not stand up very well. On the whole, the monsters are very creative and well designed.  Additionally, it is awesome that the paper is pre-perforated and scissors are not required.  My son just received another paper monster set that required painful detailed cutting - ugh!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Surprising end to this series loved it.  I really enjoyed the authors writing.  Hit all emotions in me great read.

B005SS2QXS|5.0|This protector fits very nicely and takes care of your phone. Of course we would all rather use the phone without any covers, but the first time we drop it we know we should get a tough protector, and this is a really good one. Even though its a tough one, it doesn't look too bulky for me. It's perfect for my iPhone 4s because I drop it sometimes and because I give it to my kids to play, so it's better to be safe than sorry.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book a must read.... the second of a trilogy, you will not be able to put it down.
0812973992|3.0|\\"The watchers below pulled in their breath all at once.  The air felt suddenly shared.  The man above was a word they seemed to know, though they had not heard it before.\\" (p. 7)<br /><br />The watchers in Colum McCann's \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" are New Yorkers, heads turned heavenward, eyes fixed on Philippe Petit as he eases out onto a wire strung between the twin towers of the World Trade Center.  Crazy man?  Lunatic?  Jokester? Will he jump?  Or fall?  No one knows.  And as everyone wonders, the city holds its collective breath, watches and waits.<br /><br />It is the mid 1970s.  The Twin Towers are a marvel in themselves. Nearly a quarter of a mile high, they were the tallest buildings in the world from '71 to '73.  No one would have guessed the fate that awaited thirty years down the road.<br /><br />McCann uses Petit's high wire act as the thread that weaves through this collection of linked stories.  Petit remains, simply, an unnamed aerialist so dedicated to his exquisite art form that he needs little else to thrive.  His grace and control are balletic.  His body is a supple, sinewy extension of his beautiful imagination.  He is an enigmatic and fascinating character.<br /><br />McCann spends far too little time on Petit and far too much time on characters like Corrigan and his narrator brother, Ciaran, two young Irishman trying to make a difference to the down and outers who work the streets of New York and live off them as well.  Corrigan's martyrdom is tiresome.  Ciaran seems to be an appendage, there to narrate and nothing more.  At some point, I began to feel bogged down by their shared history.<br /><br />There are other players; a mother who grieves for the son killed in Viet Nam, her husband, the judge who gets the case involving the wire walker, Tillie, a suicidal hooker who worked the streets with her seventeen year-old-daughter, a group of California computer geeks patched into a payphone on the street below the towers, and in 2006, Tillie's granddaughter Jaslyn, who finds a photo of the man on the tightrope and reflects on what things might have been like decades before.<br /><br />As much as I wanted to, I never fully dropped into the \\"Great World\\" of this story.  Some of the stories spin.  Others sputter.  Several tie together.  A few characters come on stage briefly, then disappear; the computer geeks, the graffiti photographer, feeling more like asides that could have been edited out. McCann fully inhabits his characters, giving each a distinctive voice.  I especially enjoyed Tillie's tragic voice and Jude Soderberg's unsentimental view of the justice system and the people, losers and lovers and everyone in between, who pass through its endlessly revolving door.  McCann transitions smoothly between first and third person, though some passages get a little sing-songy with the word play and are awkward and over-stylized. The ending feels tacked on.  The novel works well as a whole, though I never stopped feeling these were short-stories.  Not a bad thing, just something I was conscious of.
B007H51HEE|5.0|Shane 4 Sheriff.  Rick can't uphold the felony murder rule?  He ain't from the South.  Love how you guys teased us with Lori flinching like she might come through for Dale and support him.  RIP Dale, but you didn't know the law.  The kid must die.  He shot at another human being.  He counseled with felons.  The fact that he shot and/or was with those other criminal elements when they committed murder is enough to support the death penalty.  Andrea should have mentioned that small little trivia when Dale was crying like an ACLU baby.  If I were Shane I would try and get someone to come along with me to reconnoiter that other group.  If not I would get with the others and high tale it out of there.  Or wait around till they find you, yeah what a wonderful suicide plan you've discovered.
0345522478|5.0|This is a great book. I know that is a little bit flat as far as opening a review on an awesome book, but sometimes simple says it best.  I am a long time fan of Jim Butcher's \\"Dresden Files\\" and I am proud to say this series is right up there with those books.<br /><br />Hearne's take on mythology seen through the eyes of a 2100 year old Druid, the last living Druid, is a nice refreshing view on some old characters. And please don't take that as saying this story is just rehashed work, it is not that at all. I mean he is taking vampires, werewolves, witches, fairies along with several mythological deities and placing them all in one world with Atticus O'Sullivan as our guide.  He is a smart ass, intelligent person with a heart of gold, but understands sometimes the good guy has to get his hands dirty.  The supporting cast includes his ever faithful wolf hound, Oberon, with whom he shares a mental link, Granualle his apprentice, the Irish widow neighbor that loves her whiskey and a few other beings that are involved in helping Atticus survive his adventures.<br /><br />I have read all three books in this series and anxiously await book four and beyond.

I am running a version that is months old, and the newer updated version is more stable on ICS. The people at Splashtop are great and the product is great, I recommend buying it in the google app store instead.
1612130283|4.0|First, if I never see the word clamber again it will be too soon. Second, the author is obviously British and uses lots of Brit slang and wording in a US setting, not loving that, just set the novel in the UK and be done with it, would have made it a better read for me. Those things aside it won't stop me from reading th whole trilogy. I've been loving the whole darker romance thing for quite some time now and this fits the bill for me.
B003ZJJFKE|3.0|While I like this C.D., it isn't my favorite of my Satriani collection. It just doesn't have the intensity of \\"The Extremist\\" or \\"Crystal Planet\\".

0385534639|5.0|This book absolutely blew me away. It was different and better then I thought it could ever be. Rarely does a book suck you in and embrace you to where you feel you are literally watching it unfold. I generally see books like videos in my head, and this one was like a grand cinematic masterpiece when I read it. YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS! I guess some people have not liked it, but I'm guessing that is because they couldn't let themselves go. You must pick this up, and let yourself just experience it. Wonderful through and through!!!!!!
0545425115|5.0|I had heard so much about these books. So many people loved them. I wasn't sure I would read them or not. But the movie is coming out this month so I figured I would read the first one before going to see the movie.<br /><br />I am so glad I read it. It is very well done. It keeps you reading, I didn't want to stop after a certain point because I didn't want to leave the characters not knowing what would happen. It does have some hard spots in it but I felt like it was done in a way that didn't seem too gory. I hope they do a good job on the movie.<br /><br />One thing about the book is it left it flat in the middle of the book! I feel like I am standing on the edge of a cliff looking down wondering where to go next. I don't have book 2 yet and I am \\"hungry\\" for it! It is my 13 year olds turn to read it. I am going to get him to post a review on our school website as a guest post. I can't wait to find out what he thinks about it.

1609611543|4.0|This book is very timely, well researched, and well written.  It is so convincing that I have started to convert over to a wheat and gluten free diet for myself and my family.  Grocery stores are getting savvy about promoting the gluten free products (although these can be loaded with sugar).  I  found the information about the affects of insulin, glycemic index, AGEs very interesting and relevant.<br /><br />The only information and recommendation that Dr. Davis makes that is incongruous with the other health information he provides, is  the recommendation of eating cheese and meat, as much as you want in fact.  This was the only fault I found in the book, and he loses a little credibility with me because of that.  But, on the whole, I recommend this book.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Season 6 is just as good as all the other seasons - no slacking off here.  Some unexpected twists and shows that made me cry as well as laugh.
0891419063|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite first person narrative of a soldier in combat.  I think that I've now read this book at least four times and gave my beloved copy to my son before his combat deployment to Iraq.  Dr. Sledge captures and narrates the stress of combat along with the inner struggles to maintain a level of personal dignity under conditions which go beyond the level of human endurance.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|Let's be honest, the hit tracks from this album are undeniable. I love all of Adele's work thus far and her sophomore album is overall worthy of its particular accolades. To be honest, I'm not sure the album as a whole feels quite as fresh as Adele 19, yet, I enjoyed all of the B sides in addition to the hits. Some of the B sides have grown on me more with multiple listens too. There's just something - it might be the production - that makes 19 feel more fresh to me overall. Both 19 and 21, however, are simply must listens.<br /><br />I purchased the vinyl, which I love having. But do be warned, the mp3 download code, which is supposedly included, does not work. I don't understand what's going on that this is the case, but you're better off knowing it ahead of time. I'm still glad I got the vinyl, even though I had to turn around and buy the mp3 so I could listen in the car. But its a nice solid vinyl, not one of those cheap flimsy, just for sentiment's sake releases, and it's got that satisfyingly warm sounds that keeps vinyl lovers devoted.
B004W89N72|5.0|it is a useful app and I am rating it because l thought that it would be fun. it is.
1401937519|5.0|As other reviewers have said, this is a life-changing book.  Anita uses a delicate articulation to describe her experience in the afterlife which lead to an understanding of the Universe.<br />I feel complete after reading this book with no desire to continue reading other versions on the same topic.  Just beautiful, thought-provoking and path-changing.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is very fun and is super exciting!!! there are even tournaments in my school on who makes a higher score than others! I luv this game!!! :D
B003O86FMW|4.0|A nice follow-up to the Suzanne's first book The Hunger Games.  Katniss not only catches fire but she sizzles as she defends her choices but doesn't seek the glory.
B006W0QOF2|3.0|I read a number of different articles that mentions Drive as a must see film.  Although I think there were some great scenes in this film, overall, I think it was a little boring.  Was the girl a mute, or did they just forget to write her any lines in this movie?  My favorite scene is the motel bathroom scene.  Great detail there.
B005HI4LMS|4.0|We've had Tucker & Dale vs. Evil sitting in our Netflix queue for awhile. One of our friends liked it so much that - during the movie - she sent us a note encouraging us to see it.  You don't get that kind of endorsement every day, so we set aside time to watch it.  We were not disappointed.<br /><br />Where to start?  I was crestfallen when Reaper went off the air, so I was delighted to see Tyler Labine back in lovable form as Dale, a hillbilly with a heart of gold. His love interest is the gorgeous but underused Katrina Bowden (of 30 Rock) as Allison. Dale's best friend Tucker (Alan Tudyk) and a bevy of college morons rounds out the cast.  The college kids are off to a party in the woods which just happens to coincide with Tucker and Dale's plans to revamp their \\"vacation home.\\" When the two groups meet at a gas station - Dale forgets to put down the scythe in his hands when he tries to politely meet the college beauties - things don't go well.<br /><br />If this sounds like the plot of a typical horror movie (well, minus the \\"vacation home\\" part), it is.  When Tucker and Dale visit the rundown cabin it's a spitting image of the cabin from Evil Dead. It seems the cabin is in the same area as The Memorial Day Massacre, which Chad (Jesse Moss) recounts in curiously lurid detail.  It's not long before everyone decides to go skinny dipping (of course). Things go hilariously wrong from there.<br /><br />Tucker & Dale alternates between showing typical horror tropes from the college kids' perspective and then giving them perfectly innocent (if unlikely) explanations for them from the hillbillies' perspective. The college kids are convinced the hillbillies are the murderers from the Memorial Day Massacre. Conversely, it's not long before the two buds are convinced the kids are part of a suicide pact, hell-bent on taking everyone with them.<br /><br />The movie pivots on the relationship between Dale and Allison; less likeable leads would have ruined the movie, but here they're both terrifically cute in a film dripping with gore. As appealing though the burgeoning romance between the furry hillbilly and the blonde college co-ed is, it's the best friends who really cement the movie. Tucker and Dale's relationship never flags even when one of them starts losing appendages.<br /><br />The one element that works against the film is the titular \\"Evil\\" of the title.  It's not hard to spot who is the real villain and unfortunately Tucker & Dale telegraphs him a little too early.  That doesn't detract from the careful plotting and clever script, which delivers on all its promises.<br /><br />Tucker & Dale vs. Evil is a love letter to cult horror fans that's not afraid to throw a little love into the plot too.  If you're a fan of Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, or any of their successors you won't be disappointed.hey're both terrifically cute in a film dripping with gore.

1577314808|3.0|I hate self-help books. They tend to be trite, condescending, and full of a hideous lie: Self-transformation is easy if you'd only swallow your ego and follow me. They are all variations of that theme. I don't think I've read a self-help book since my mother left them on the coffee table during the 1970s.<br /><br />Recently, however, a friend of mine, Mike, said Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now helped him a lot. Mike is no stereotype of a self-help book addict. He is working on his black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Out of respect to him, I gave The Power of Now a try. I found the book unpleasant to read, redundant, full of new age clich&eacute;s that I used to hear while working in a wine store in Berkeley in the 1980s and very little of the book offered anything new or practical.<br /><br />Also, I was skeptical of Tolle's personal account of his own religious experience, which he claims compelled him to write his best-selling book. In the typical motif of a great religious leader, Tolle was down in the dumps, had lost his taste for life, had thoughts of suicide and then unexpectedly while in his home his body and mind burned with the presence of a Spiritual Power so great that he wept tears of joy for months and was content to not work or barely eat, living the life of a blissed-out homeless person. Over time, he articulated what had happened to him, studying the world's religions, and the synthesis of the study bore fruit in The Power of Now.<br /><br />Reading his personal account struck me as the work of an effective fiction writer, but I don't claim to know Tolle's heart. He may be telling the truth.<br /><br />In any event, his life as a homeless person overflowing with spiritual joy seems to be his credential: Millions of people hunger for his experience: The loss of ego and joyful presence in the now.<br /><br />Tolle does a good job of describing the human animal's hardwiring for misery and unhappiness and I agree with all his points: We are lost in a recurring loop of thoughts about our past and future. We live too much in our heads. Our self-destructive thoughts are born from our ego: We think of grandiosity, self-pity, spite, and other signs of emotional retardation. The solution? We need to stand back and watch ourselves when we think these thoughts and not identity our self with these thoughts. How do we do it? The more we become the Watcher of our Mind, the less these thoughts occur.<br /><br />I tried this technique and found myself watching myself watching myself watch myself. It was like getting lost in a hall of mirrors.<br /><br />Elsewhere in the book Tolle says we should stop our egotistical thoughts. How? By dropping them. He writes, \\"If you have a hot piece of coal in your hands, you simply drop it.\\" The ego is the same thing.<br /><br />See how easy it is?<br /><br />Thousands, perhaps millions, have attested to the power of this book to change their lives. It didn't work for me. Of course Tolle and his acolytes would pity me and say my ego won my personal battle, with me coming out as the loser.<br /><br />My prejudice towards self-help books remains unchanged. A good remedy for these books is the now out-of-print I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional by Wendy Kaminer.<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br /><br />I suspect my friendship with Mike will survive.

B004P8JPS6|4.0|In comic books, the \\"creation myth\\" may be the most critical element of any superhero's story.  Sure, we want to see the hero beat the bad guys in the present day, but we have a huge appetite to know the intricacies of where the superhero comes from - how he or she transitions from the everyday to the extraordinary.<br /><br />Jack Reacher may be an anti-hero, but he's a superhero in every sense of the word.  Sure, he may take a beating like John McClane in \\"Die Hard,\\" but he's brilliant, dedicated, and a monster in a fight.  When we met Reacher in the series' first book, \\"Killing Floor,\\" he was already walking the earth \\"like Caine in 'Kung Fu'\\" after a storied military career, carrying only a toothbrush from adventure to adventure.  Over the novels we've received glimpses into his past and we understood that Reacher abandoned his MP career after a mission gone awry, but we never really knew what it was.<br /><br />With \\"The Affair,\\" Lee Child puts us back in Carter Crossing, Mississippi in 1997, where everything changes for Reacher.  A young woman has been murdered and the local military base has been locked down for damage control - somebody suspects that someone on the base is involved, and the Powers That Be want to protect either someone or something at that base.  Reacher is sent to Carter Crossing to go undercover - his counterpart is already doing his thing on the base.<br /><br />Anyone who has read the Reacher novels knows that sending the six-foot-six Reacher undercover anywhere other than an Ultimate Fighting Championship bout is a fool's errand.  Reacher quickly ends up investigating the crime(s) of Carter Crossing alongside the gorgeous Sheriff Devereaux, who may or may not be a suspect.  Bodies pile up and Reacher once again gets to wreak havoc while using his razor-sharp detective skills.<br /><br />Fans of this series will enjoy snippets and cameos from the Reacher Legend - favorite peripheral characters such as Leon Garber, Frances Neagley and even Joe Reacher play various roles in this story.  \\"The Affair\\" breaks little new ground for the series but instead dives deeper into the Reacher story.  Fortunately, Child has enough story for Reacher that we care about this one - \\"The Affair\\" is far from a sorry money-making retread like \\"Scream 4.\\"<br /><br />As lean and mean as ever, the Reacher series adds another quality entry to its famed roster with \\"The Affair.\\"

While most of the cards are very attractive and delightful, some are irritating or seem silly. For example, the grinning angel in the Travel card looks somewhat diabolical in my opinion, and the man in the Speaker card looks grubby and smelly. I have no complaints about the chiseled body of the guy on the Builder card, but he looks like he just leaped out of a Playgirl centerfold, which makes me snicker.<br /><br />An odd thing I noticed the other day while looking through Cheryl Richardson's Self Care Cards, which I recently purchased, was that one of the cards in her deck entitled Wisdom is the same as the Study card in Doreen Virtue's deck.

0815411839|4.0|First of all I have to say I have not finished reading this book but I am almost to chapter 20 so I'm about 500 pages into the book. I have long been fascinated with Marilyn Monroe and own 5 books about her and several of her movies and yet I never read any of them but recently I decided I wanted to read a biography on her and I noticed I owned this book by Donald Spoto so I looked it up and most people said that it is the most accurate and detailed biography on Marilyn Monroe so I decided I'd read it. And so far I've have learned a lot about Marilyn's life and anyone who really wants to know about Marilyn should read this book.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this book was that there was an extreme amount of details and things that did not necessarily need to be written and I felt like the book could have been cut shorter and gotten straighter to the points. I cannot count how many times I read about how Marilyn had to constantly re shoot every seen in most of her movies because of her lack of self confidence or how many times it was stressed that her acting coach Natasha Lytess was a burden to directors and producers and such, or how many times Marilyn felt like she had to please everyone and wanted desperately to be loved (although important aspects about her, I did not need to read it 5,000 times.)<br /><br />And honestly, this is a great book and even though the details and repeated statements almost made this book hard to read I did learn a lot about Marilyn and most things we could know about her. And even after almost being done with the book I don't necessarily feel like I knew Marilyn personally at all but that I only knew a lot ABOUT her. I wanted to feel submersed like I was right there with her but I didn't get that feeling.<br /><br />With that said, it would be impossible to actually have known her personally, but I wish we could. In all, Marilyn had a very tragic, sad, lost life and I really feel sad while reading this book and only wish I could go back in time and help her in someway. I'm dreading getting to the end because I know what's coming.go back in time and help her in someway. I'm dreading getting to the end because I know what's coming.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Director Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) once again proves to be one of Hollywood's finest filmmakers in the spectacular science fiction thriller Inception. In the near future, exists the technology to enter the human mind during the dream state, and international thief and spy Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his team of specialists are among the very finest at extracting valuable secrets deep with a person's subconscious. When offered a chance for redemption, Cobb must perform an almost impossible task: the implantation of an original idea into a person's subconscious. Not only one of the most acclaimed and successful films of 2010, Inception is also one of the most original and well structured thrillers to hit the big screen in years. The movie is one of those rare big-budgeted summer Hollywood productions that not only delivers stunning special effects and great action but an engrossing storyline and notable performances. The cast also includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, Ken Watanabe and Michael Caine.<br /><br />If you're planning to add Inception to your Blu-Ray collection, it will surely standout among your other titles. The acclaimed Sci-Fi thriller is presented in 2.4:1 widescreen format. The Blu-Ray boasts with an excellent picture and audio presentation. The picture transfer comes out almost perfect with rich colors and striking contrast. The DTS-HD Master Audio ranks as one of the engaging audio tracks of any 2010 Blu-Ray releases. Among its most interesting special feature is the Extraction Mode with Christopher Nolan, cast and crew whom provide great behind-the-scenes information. Other supplemental material include theatrical trailers, TV spots, promotional and picture galleries, and two behind-the-scenes featurettes (Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious & Inception: The Cobol Job). The Blu-Ray release of Inception scores an \\"A\\".

B0067AC5KA|5.0|Several people who had seen the movie said it was really wierd and didn't recommend it. I did not find the trilogy to be wierd at all. I thought the books were very well done with one exception. Half way through the second book the heroine suffered a series of injuries from which not even Flash Gordon could have survived. Some of the younger readers may not remember Flash but he was the hero of a series who was left dangling from a cliff at the end of each weeks show. The point of the injuries could been achieved without her being shot several times including through the brain and then being buried. Other than that, I enjoyed the books and highly recommend them.
030771652X|4.0|Bee's doggedness in pursuit of her sister's possible killer is admirable and I enjoyed how the author slowly let the pieces of her life and sanity slip away during her pursuit.  I thought there were plenty of characters who might have had a motive, so there was enough fun for the reader to try to explore the outcome. The way the novel is written is more like a stream of consciousness so that is a little different. I thought it was an unsual novel and I did enjoy the twists of the ending.

1400069289|5.0|This is a very good book full of practical information. I found the first, second, third, and fourth chapters particularly useful, but I also found much to enjoy in the rest of the book.<br /><br />The author, citing many studies, boils the habit loop down to a very simple formula: cue plus routine plus reward. After a certain number of repetitions of a new pattern, a craving for the reward will develop and stimulate the whole cycle. A strong belief that this is all doable keeps the thing going. One creates a new habit by changing the old routine, keeping the same cue to begin the behavior and the same reward. The brain has a natural preference for habits over random reactions to stimuli, and we can use this to our advantage. The author cites many examples of ways to keep improving  and stimulating good habits on the one hand, and to substitute new behaviors for less desirable ones on the other.<br /><br />It is very nice to see this simple but powerful pattern laid out so clearly. I can think of innumerable ways to apply this formula in my own life, and to use it in helping other people. Though I read an uncorrected proof of the book, I did manage to get the a look at the explanatory chapter at the end, which is excellent.<br /><br />The one thing missing from all of this is the emotional component: in the case of addictive or escapist habits, what works for many people I know is to first figure out what specific emotional situation or unresolved problem is driving the craving, and do something specific to address that problem, if possible, or perhaps just take one little step toward solving it. Then one can decide on an alternate activity that fits the cue and reward.<br /><br />But getting back to The Power of Habit, I find it fascinating to ponder the idea that just about every human being has a brain that works in this way. Apparently, businesses and corporations find it equally fascinating. The reader may be surprised to find out how much companies like Targetalready know about all of us and how devious their ways of acquiring and sharing information can be.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent book, with good practical application in so many areas.

He's a great writer, so they were all good books, although none came up to the level of Ghost, which is also true of The Fear Index. I was so looking forward to it, and thought from the opening chapter that it would be another home run for Harris, but it sadly did not deliver. Too much very technical stuff about finance and how computers interface. You can tell that the author got all caught up in how markets work. I'm not so amused.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|The fun started in the fall of 2011, when Lana Del Rey (fka Lizzy Grant) released a self-produced cut-and-paste music video for the track \\"Video Games.\\" All the popular music bloggers had to have their say about music's conflicting new meme. Despite a generally glowing response to the song, the focus quickly shifted to the girl in the video with the teasing glances any puffy lips. Plastic surgery? Probably. An awkward performer? Definitely. A phony industry creation disguised as a credible artist with indie appeal? Maybe. A young lady with a desire to sing her way into big fame? Oh absolutely.    So here's the thing: outside of Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Jay-Z, Kanye West and a few others, major label artists aren't selling records like they used to. What has been selling strongly across the board, however, is indie music. Dweeb listeners and wannabe dweebs alike are the consumers who still regularlly pay for their music. The Decemberists, The Arcade Fire, Vampire Weekend and Spoon have all had huge opening weeks, comparitely to the rest of the industry, over the last couple of years. And so when Lana Del Rey arrived, a number of guarded music writers called foul. Del Rey was - or seemed to be - an industry puppet. A manipulative, pandering artist aimed at the tough-sell indie buyer. And if there's one thing \\"serious\\" music fans love - ney, demand - it's authenticity. And so the months in between the release of the \\"Video Games\\" single and Del Rey's debut, Born to Die (she had another album under the name Lizzy Grant) were full of speculation and gossip. Pretentious music blogs had suddenly become tabloid papers fixated on documenting the possible fraud behind \\"Video Games.\\" Del Rey couldn't do anything right.    Then, at the end of January, the album was released. On a major label. All around the world. At Target, at Best Buy, at indie stores. Lana Del Rey was everywhere and, almost instantly, the angry chatter stopped. The knee-jerk reviews were negative and further played on the gossip, but that's only expected in this era of lousy music journalism. Regardless, the record sold very well. And listeners loved it. Loved it, myself included - sketchy factoids be damned. The kiddie fun was over when the music started and the possible frauds no longer factored in. Say what you will about Del Rey's personal branding, exaggerated features and poor live performances - the girl (and her impressive studio team) has made some great, great songs. Songs that feel both retro and modern. She sings about video games and Diet Mountain Dew and talks about hip-hop while, in the same breath, fantasizing about old Vegas, classic Hollywood glamour and, in general, more romantic times. Her production, handled by the in-demand Emile Haynie (Kid Cudi, Eminem, Lil Wayne, etc.), mixes modern pop and hip-hop elements with cabaret and 50s pop while maintaining a Nancy Sinatra-obsessed retro vibe. Big strings and bigger drums. Needless to say, the sound is - like the writing and singing - at once modern and retro. And always very girly. Del Rey herself describes the sound as \\"Hollywood sadcore.\\" Okay, sure.    All that said, Born to Die is hardly a perfect \\"debut.\\" Some of the lyrics are outright embarrassingly immature, shallow and transparent. But hey, that's sort of point of Lizzy Grant's glamorous Lana Del Rey character, isn't it? She's fake. She's Hollywood by way of Brooklyn. We get it. The biggest issue is that the record is far too long for a debut. My disc, purchased at Target and said to have two \\"bonus tracks,\\" is 14 songs deep. That's three or four tracks too many for a new artist who is still figuring things out. After seven great, diverse, totally addictive songs, Born to Die gets inconsistent very quickly. It gets borderline borring and repetitve. But hey, those first seven tracks are strong. Damn strong. And while Haynie's thick, diverse retro production is nothing short of brilliant, the singer manages to remain the star withher breathy and hypnotic contralto vocals and often interesting writing. Del Rey floats over the strings in \\"Video Games\\" and bounces over the hip-hop production of \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" with an equal ability and range. The girl understands songwriting and melody, and most definitely knows the power of a good sing-along hook.    At first too pretty to be taken seriously and now too good to be ignored. If only Lana Del Rey could figure out how to stand on a stage without making everyone within eyeshot feel puke-y with discomfort, she'd be a well deserved Next Big Thing. Or maybe she already is.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Very interesting read.  Poses more questions about a history event than I ever thought possible from an author that specializes in the types of books that are his norm.  Read this book and and you may have doubts too!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I like the new look they have, for the most part, but just like on my phone it just seems sluggish. Granted I may not have the latest phone, but I would expect it to run smoother on my Fire. Unfortunately it does not. I know this is new, so benefit of the blah blah blah
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I waited a month or so after getting my Kindle Fire to get a case for it because I wanted to see what features I should be looking for/what features wouldn't be necessary for my use. I ultimately chose the Marware MicroShell Folio cover because it offers a streamlined form of protection (no extra bulk) that you can get in different colors and will double as a viewing easel. I am so pleased with my decision. I got mine in pink, which adds a nice punch of color. It fits snugly & securely over my Fire. The elastic band is high-quality. The easel only works for horizontal viewing, which I decided would be the only reason I would use such a feature (my assumption has proved right for my usage). I was a little skeptical the easel would really hold, but it does. I like that this case doesn't add bulk or weight to my kindle & protects it. Still fits very easily in my purse. I also like that it is not a leather-type folio case because the oils in the hands always make those look dirty/old over time. I'm confident this case will look exactly the same for years to come (probably by then I'll have the new latest & greatest Kindle!).

B0050DIWFC|5.0|this book kept me up one night finishing it and many more digesting it. others have given the plot so i wont bother with that. i will say this book gives you an inside look at what the parents of a teen accused of murder go through especially when one parent is a cop. who do you believe? what do you believe? and what do you do with both of those answers? no easy answers will be found here. but the terrific writing will keep you guessing until the end, while the story and the dilemma of the characters will stay with you long after the book is done.

0684830485|5.0|Very good, thought provoking piece of literature.  I do not think I can say much to add to what has been said about the content.  However, I would point out that I really like the Scribner Classics edition that I purchased.  They are well-bound with tight pages and clear print.  The dust jackets are a matte finish instead of glossy, and they look very good on the shelf.  If you enjoy the feel of a real book in your hand and the clean look of a collection on the shelf, you'll appreciate the Scribner Classics.
1594744769|5.0|Often as I finish a novel, I think politely, \\"Well, that was a nice little story and the author has a style that made it easy to read.\\"  Ransom Riggs is simply mind-blowing!  I'm amazed that some people have minds that can conjure such interesting and complex stories and then when you couple such a talent with the ability to transfer the story to paper in such a pleasantly readable format, I've again been blessed with reading utopia.<br /><br />Some will undoubtedly find this to be a bizarre, strange story. Indeed it is, but it is ever so enjoyable and entertaining. It will provide you with several hours of reading pleasure.
B00425S1H8|5.0|The product is solid.  I did not have any issues with it.  its far better buying this product than going on ebay and trying to look for a cheaper one.  Saves you the headache.
0385342063|5.0|I've been a fan of Sophie Kinsella's novels since I read Confessions of A Shopaholic a few years ago. But the third book in the series, as well as The Undomestic Goddess weren't nearly as good and I had sort of given up on her books. So when I started I've Got Your Number, I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised, however - this is a hilarious, timely novel!<br /><br />What makes this book so great is just how appropriate it is for today. With all of our technology and our obsessions with phones and email and what not, it was sort of refreshing to see a story that utilized technology instead of ragging on it or ignoring it altogether. I loved that Poppy and Sam \\"met\\" first during a phone call, and most of their interactions were via text. While I'm not sure this is the best way to start a relationship with someone, it made for some pretty hilarious scenes.<br /><br />I had forgotten just how funny Sophie Kinsella's mind is. She comes up with some of the most ridiculous, hysterical moments I've ever read. One of my particular favorites involves Poppy sending a lot of emails to people that work with Sam, signing them with his name - including volunteering for a charity trip to Guatemala, accidentally flirting with a coworker, and writing nasty email to his ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />Poppy in general was really funny. I loved her as an MC! She was spunky and cute, but also down-to-earth and realistic. And I really liked that she had issues with confrontation. It made her really relatable. But she still maintained that classic, quirky Kinsella voice that marks all her heroines.<br /><br />The romance in this one isn't really in the forefront. I mean, it is...but it's not. Really, it's more about Poppy coming to grips with her relationship with her fiance and her own confidence. She has to deal with her insecurities about not being \\"smart enough\\" to fit into her fiance's family, and she has the added stress of having to be a part of Sam's life, via email and text. While she and Sam do have a romance, it wasn't the main point of the novel IMHO. And that's what made it a chick-lit story instead of a classic romance.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good chick-lit with a really funny twist. It's a quick read that's really fun and sure to keep you entertained.<br /><br />Similar Books: A Girl like You by Gemma Burgess, Love the One You're With by Emily Griffin

B007G5FX4K|5.0|This is one hot track to dance and sing to. Girl is a true blend of artist and producer, although you can clearly hear Benny's influence Madonna and her influence and energy come through on this track full force. Its a fun, dance/pop record with heavy electro elements that I think work well with todays crossover market. This is very similar to the work with Calvin Harris and Rihanna, where the producer and the artist blend and combine to push out some of their best work as a collaboration and celebration of the individual instead of fighting against each other. GREAT TRACK
0062082353|2.0|While I admire Kyle's accomplishments on the battlefield and laud his bravery, I found this to be a painful book to read.  One should expect that, with the aid of ghostwriters, his exploits could have been chronicled in a tight, terse manner worthy of his feats of heroism.  What we get instead is a sophomoric, smarmy, seemingly endless wallow in the slough of Kyle's narcissism.  His co-authors should have saved him (and spared us) from all the self-congratulation and cheesy navel-gazing.<br /><br />The only parts worth reading were the actual narratives of combat actions, and they could have been dispatched in a pamphlet.  But for the (largely gratuitous) vulgarities, this is written at about a third grade level.  More's the pity, for there's a story there worth the telling.  How it slipped through the editing process in such sorry shape is a mystery, but not one worth the time to explore.  Largely a waste of time.
B0000024JA|5.0|Method Man isn't up there with my favorite Wu-Tang MC's so I was kind of hesitant to buy this but my gut said it'd pay off. It's a good thing I listened to my gut because Method Man totally blows you away on this.<br /><br />The first song kind of feels like a warm-up but the rest of the album has that excellent Wu-Tang production, other members are on here and do amazing with their rhymes. I really can't find much bad to say about this CD.<br /><br />I guess the one major thing to point out is that \\"All I Need\\" isn't the same song you're probably used to hearing on the radio with Mary J. Blige. \\"All I Need\\" on this album is Method Man going it alone and doing a really good job of it. If you like the Mary J. Blige version, you can get the single.<br /><br />Definitely recommended to fans of the Wu-Tang Clan and good rap music.
B000000H4V|5.0|My introduction to this band was the album \\"Roots\\" and I really liked their style and how they incorporated tribal sounds into the mix. When I got \\"Chaos AD\\", I was literally blown away by the raw power and intensity of the band. The tribal sound I loved so much was even more evident here.<br /><br />Make no mistake though, this is hardcore metal at it's finest hour. The guitar work consists of memorable guitar lines, riffs, atmospheric guitar blending, and blistering solos. The drumming is also extremely good and powerful, not to mention inventive.<br /><br />This whole album isn't just a normal metal record because it steps outside the traditional and offers an instrumental track with acoustic guitars and tribal instruments and all throughout has a distinct sound that's very hard to duplicate.<br /><br />Max Cavalera's vocals are extremely raw and fueled with passion. He screams the majority of the time but it fits the juggernaut sound of the backing music. The lyrics are mainly political and humanitarian. As angry as Max sounds a lot of the time, it isn't anger you're usually getting; it's frustration and a strong desire to fix the wrongs of the world. Overall, if you get past some of the metaphors, the lyrics here have a positive message.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks the were added on for the re-issue, the Chaos BC sound montage is unnecessary, the extra tribal version of the instrumental is good but not as good as the one on the album, Territory (live) sounds amazing, and Amen/Inner Self (live) was decent but sounded better on the album.<br /><br />Without this in your collection, you're really missing out if you love Sepultura or Soulfly. If you love metal music in general, this is something to check out.<br /><br />Recommended.
B006TJXZ30|2.0|Works great for getting my emails but so does the pre-installed email app I got. It only gets 2 stars because it advertises calendar sync &amp; it does not do that. There doesn't appear to be any effort to fix that.

B000PY6BBI|4.0|This is one of my all time most beloved films. It is stunning, beautifully written, the acting is outstanding, and the writing intelligent and well-paced. I would love to give it 5 stars - but the soundtrack is simply the worst I have ever heard. My wish is that someone take the film and completely redo the soundtrack and re-release. I have no doubt it would do very well. Such a jewel but the soundtrack is so poor it distracts from what could be a one of the best films ever. The film is brilliant - the music - makes it almost unwatchable. Almost.<br />It will always be one of the most romantic, magical films.
B000I8HIR2|4.0|Very creative, well done film. One of the best I have seen in this genre for quite some time.<br />Intense, with some great soundtrack work, I am impressed. Thank you to the creative team for<br />something innovative and interesting!

B004J4WN0I|5.0|I'm not normally much of a fan of sci-fi/fantasy books with male protagonist, especially written by male authors.  There is a bit too much focus on bouncing boobage and such.  That being said I found the protagonist in this series very honestly, and appealingly male. Not the ultra alpha hero or Luke Skywalker clones that are all too common.<br /><br />  He's clever, but not perfect....and has such a fresh and appealing outlook on life. For all that he's still.....well.....a guy and I love that! He messes with idiots cause he can, and its funny.  He does dude stuff with his dog and dude friends.  Yet the author has blended the fantastical into the real with such skill and ease that it all seems so approachable.....and you get to thinking.....of course that just works.  Instead of the all to common \\"Really your gonna go THERE!\\" reaction I seem to have to oh so many new entries into the modern fantasy market.<br /><br />  Kevin Hearne's spin on the life of a druid in the modern world is entrancingly entertaining, and for me at least a new series to get addicted to.<br /><br />So give the Druid and his wolfhound, his lawyers, the bookstore/tea-bar...and the rest of his wonderfully entertainingly crafted world a ride.  I'm already on the third book and loving every minute of it!

B004W89N72|3.0|that is what makes this app totally useless to me. if a calendar doesnt at least import from the built in google calendsr then i have no use for it. the only nice things i can say about it is that i like the layout, the move to sd, and the colorful tabs for the notes. it really needs sync and multiple alarms like informant.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder is an amazing book, I've heard that time and again but I finally got the chance to read it this week. Well ok, really I got the day to read it, because I was so intrigued by the story once I started it I could not put this book down.<br />A futuristic Cinderella story, a woman even more abandoned than the original Cinderella, a Prince with a life we finally get to glimpse. What here is not to love!<br /><br />I give major kudos to Marissa Meyer as the author who made the Step-Sisters, not the typical drones, Each had a different personality and I loved it. Really all of the characters were amazing and detailed and I felt like I really knew something of their lives. When you add in threats of war from another planet. Ruling leaders who quite honestly scare me before I even meet them and a new emperor who is just not quite sure how to balance on the beam of his new life you have a fantastically spun tale. I am thrilled that this book is a series and cannot wait for book two! Until I can get my hands in it I'll spend my time dreaming of the future I want to see for Cinder!

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was a great book that ended the series which began with the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. Sadly there will be no more. Stieg Larsson was a great writer. My only complaint is the cost of the e-title. I still have a hard time understanding why they are so expensive. The paper back addition was less than half the price and I'm sure there was more cost involved in creating and distributing it.
B005N0PJJO|4.0|To be honest, I was a little disappointed by this book. It wasn't darker than Fifty Shades of Grey. If anything, it was less passionate and less intriguing, as Ana and Christian agree to try out a \\"vanilla\\" relationship, and are largely happy.<br /><br />The darkness comes as Christian, reluctantly, reveals more about his traumatic childhood, and what causes him to interested in the BDSM he feels he needs.<br /><br />The chemistry is still there between Christian and Ana, and while he has retained his domineering side, he's agreed not to get too kinky, which for me ruins the book a little, because what I loved about the first book was the conflict (both between Christian and Ana and in Ana's own mind) about this aspect of the relationship.<br /><br />Christian is the same character, softened just a tiny bit by his love for Ana. Ana, on the other hand, is a little odd in this book. She attracts pretty much every man who glances at her, and remains completely ignorant of it. In the first book she was clumsy and bookish and nerdy and innocent, which is what I loved about her, and a lot of that is gone now.<br /><br />A lot of the plot revolves around Christian's past getting between the two of them- both his very early childhood and his past subs. The ending is a cliffhanger, but not about their relationship, so it's not as gobsmackingly cruel on E.L. James' part.<br /><br />The dialogue between Ana and Christian is sweet, steamy and had me grinning like a loon a lot of the time, especially when they're emailing each other (Christian's younger, more playful side shows through a lot more in emails).<br /><br />Christian makes this book. He's dark and so incredibly attractive, and his attempts to change for Ana are heartbreaking, as are the insights into the traumatic childhood that made him unable to let ANYONE touch him (oh, my heart!)<br /><br />I have already started reading Fifty Shades Freed, the next book in the trilogy, largely to see how the cliffhanger resolvesitself. I've largely lost interest in the erotic aspect of this book, and didn't enjoy it as much as the first one.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Addictive. Needs more levels!  I flew through them and I need more lol. Would recommend to anyone as a fun, quick time filler that you will keep coming back to.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This is a very passionate, breathless romance between Ana, a 21-year-old student, and Christian Grey, an obscenely rich CEO in his mid-twenties who seems much older than he is.<br /><br />They're instantly attracted to each other, but between them is Christian's past and very specific BDSM sexual needs.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is not the sex scenes (there are lots, and more on those later) but the psychological turmoil Ana experiences when she's asked to become Christian's sub. She is given a contract, a non-disclosure agreement and a list of rules. She is meant to obey Christian at all times, right down to what she eats, what she wears and how she works out.<br /><br />The writing style is a little juvenile, but I think that suits in a way, because Ana is inexperienced, innocent and (sexually) younger than her years. I haven't read anything else by the author, so I don't know if this was deliberate on her part, but I'd like to think it was.<br /><br />The sex scenes are hot though not as kinky as you could find in other books. I'm a little bewildered by the reviews I've read saying that the sex scenes were disturbing and repulsive and that no woman should ever agree to what Christian wants to do. They are tempered a little by Ana's innocence and inexperience.<br /><br />Christian is a great character. He's dark and powerful, but when he's emailing Ana he becomes very playful and much more his own age. The two sides fit together perfectly, and he's a great, well-rounded character. The fact that he's domineering and bossy and authoritative and stalkerish is balanced out by his own genuine and real turmoil.<br /><br />Ana's reluctance to accept the BDSM aspect of Christian is fabulous. She wants him, but she's not sure if she can accept 'all' of him. I love that she wants to try, because she's afraid of losing Christian, and she's not instantly into that lifestyle. Too many books have the heroines suddenly and miraculously accept something unbelievable, or shocking (like the existence of vampires, for example), but this book felt very real and honest.<br /><br />Some things lead me to doubt that this was deliberate though, because the same phrases (and indeed whole pages) are repeated throughout the book. Ana has no phrase to express her surprise, or delight, or shock, or dismay, or happiness, besides \\"Oh my.\\" The entire list of rules is repeated at least twice.<br /><br />There wasn't a lot of plot, to be perfectly honest. It largely revolved around Ana and Christian and whether they'll work, and whether they'll engage in everything Christian says he needs. It's a great set-up to the other two books though, where there is actually a non-romantic plot.<br /><br />Overall, I absolutely loved the book. I kept checking my progress through it, not to see how soon it would be finished, but to see how much longer I had to enjoy it. It was more passionate than erotic, I thought, thanks to the intensity of emotion and Ana's innocence and reluctance.<br /><br />PS: Don't let the fan-fiction talk put you off, it's no identifiable as a fan fiction just from reading it.
B0061S073A|3.0|I loved this app when I first downloaded it. It worked so well for keeping my 2 year old from calling people and from purchasing other apps. Unfortunately it started freezing my phone after the last update and has become completely unusable. If I can get it to start in the first place, I have to remove my battery to exit out since part of the design is to prevent the kids from shutting down the phone. I loved this app before it stopped working.

0811879631|3.0|True to the late Steve Jobs's philosophy, this is an impressively high-quality art book that would look great on your bookcase or coffee table, but be warned that it appeals more to the artist than to the movie buff.<br /><br />I expected storyboarded scripts that used actual stills from the movies, with perhaps the dialog printed below each frame - something between a script and a graphic novel - but what they really are are sketches, some more primitive than others, and each done in a different artistic style. Some of the styles just don't appeal to me at all, such as the harsh art-deco cut-out look they used for The Incredibles, or the darker, low-contrast, primitive chalk sketches used for A Bug's Life.<br /><br />I also thought these were supposed to be complete scripts - a storyboard for every major shot in the movie - but for Ratatouille there are fewer than 4 pages of images - not even an image per scene. There is absolutely no text - either dialog or direction - associated with the \\"scripts\\".<br /><br />I have known the kinds of folks at whom this book is aimed - people who sit around coffee shops with sketch pads and art & animation junkies - and I think they will adore it, but this book is not meant for the masses, and is certainly not meant for younger kids - they won't appreciate it.<br /><br />It is not my intention to anger those folks who will truly appreciate this book, this book has an audience that will appreciate it for what it is, but the casual Pixar movie lover or parent should be warned that this book is probably not what you're looking for. That is the reason for my 3-star review: I think this polarizing book will have a small audience for whom it will be a 5-star book, and a larger audience for whom it will be a 1-star book. You need to know which camp you fall into.<br /><br />I love movies. I love Pixar. I love quality books. This book represents all those things, yet I do not find it interesting and regret having purchased it.<br />Sorry..
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Still think the trilogy is worth reading, but was really disappointed In the direction it went.<br /><br />It is something I could see coming from a mile away and when I saw it I lost interest. Didn't think it really went the way it should but maybe for the target audience it fit.

B003WTE886|4.0|It's kind of funny, Taylor Swift named the album \\"Speak Now\\" because it's supposed to be based on words she should've said but was too afraid to speak up, but isn't that what she's always done, speaking her mind about her relationships and inner turmoil? And alot of the content on this album goes into great detail about the situations in her past and her exact thoughts during each scenario, rarely does she speak of a situation happening to her in the present. It's hard to deny the fact that Taylor comes across whiney instead of personable, but then again if we all had record-deals all we would sing about are the grievances or magical experiences that happen to us. Taylor verbalizes them well, and the musical content is good, but not as lively as some of her previous efforts. She kind of drags her feet through this one, as she managed to make a 14-song collection over and hour in length. What's also kind of ironic is that Taylor is encouraging you to speak NOW, but only offers short autobiographies of events that happened to her THEN. But what makes the album a hit is that she isn't afraid to take risks and be blunt about the people she is addressing in her songs (\\"Dear John\\" should be a good example), and she also creates a \\"stop reading my diary\\" reaction when you listen to it, because like it or not, alot of the stuff she sings about happens to everyone of us at least one point in our lives. So call this album whiney, long, trying, stiff, or even boring, it doesn't matter, you've been given an arsenal of things you can say when these situations happen to you, and you'll know what words to say at that moment, so you won't regret not saying anything, and you will get the courage that Taylor utilized in this great piece of work.
B000002O96|5.0|Both the Super Blues, and the Super, Super Blues albums are essential for any blues collection. To say nothing of the number of blues super stars who perform on them (both the front men and the back line), the music is played without the restraints of the 3 minute limit common to the commercial releases of most of the all-time great blues hits. Live versions of blues songs often extend far beyond that time constraint. The Super Blues recordings are recorded live in the studio and definitely give the listener that live experience The Super Blues albums definitely groove. I could never understand the criticism these albums have received. Being a professional blues performer since 1961, I've played and heard a lot of blues both ancient and contemporary, and am fully aware of all the blues classic recordings. With that said, I feel the Super Blues albums are some of the best recordings of that era of blues spanning the mid 1950s-mid 1960s--a must have in any blues collection.[[ASIN:B000002O94 Super Blues]]

B00004Y87O|2.0|The only reason I'm writing a review here, as so many have already done so, is to tip the scales to attain some degree of sensibility.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Manhattan has been walled in and is now the prison for the entire country. No one goes in without a sentence and no one gets out. Air Force One is hijacked by a \\"freedom force.\\" The President ejects in a life pod. Where does the pod land? Yup. In Manhattan. He's being ransomed off. Snake Pliskin (Kurt Russel) was just sentenced to prison, but now they need him to save the Pres. Can he, will he, save the day?<br /><br />This just isn't that good. I didn't believe the set up what so ever. With thousands of square miles of desert available, no one is going to forfeit New York for prison inmates. And Air Force one being hijacked? Sorry. Never happen. Sending Pliskin in for the rescue? Sorry. Never happen. The Feds have endless resources at their disposal. Pliskin, even though he's ex-special ops, just shouldn't be that high on the list. And where is his specialness? He doesn't do much that is all that clever or daring. And what of his physical prowess? He does little to show us his ability to kill a hundred guys with only a chicken bone. Even his fight with a gargantuan opponent, even though his leg is wounded, is more than clumsy. He should have done that guy in in a heartbeat.<br /><br />Russel looks good but he spits out most of his lines through clenched teeth. Van Cleef (as the head cop) is Okay but I didn't believe him either. Adrian Barbeau looks her usual good self, but she doesn't have much to do. The rest of the cast are decent enough.<br /><br />I just thought this was a failed effort most of the way around. If there were some allegory there it wasn't strong enough for me. It just needed better everything.

0525478817|5.0|I waited a long time for this book I preordered it months in advance. I knew what I was in for but that still did not prepare me for it. This book scared me after I read the first few pages I put it down and didn't touch it for over a month I would stare at it everyday but I couldn't read it. Here is why this book talks about Cancer (this is just a small part of what this book is about) but at the mention of Cancer I pulled the eject cord and I WAS OUT! My husband has Kidney Cancer I've lost three other family members to Cancer I was sick of hearing or reading about it. But I came back because I wasn't going to let Cancer take anything else away from me including this book that I had been waiting months for. I'm thankful that I won that battle because this book is amazing and to have missed out on it would have been a huge regret to me. I feel this book should be put on required reading lists at every school that has required reading lists. In my 29 years of life I've read around 300 books and I would with out a doubt say The fault in our stars is in my Top ten favorite list. So if you're reading this review and you want to know if you should get this book my answer is Yes!

B006TX276C|4.0|David Sylvian has long been one of my favorite vocalists, with a certain hushed elegance in his singing.  He's also been one of the best and most innovative songwriters over the years.  His new 2-disc compilation, called A Victim of Stars, does a very good job of covering his work since the band Japan.  (The Japan song \\"Ghosts\\" is presented in a later reworking.)  So many of these songs are what I consider \\"essential,\\" including Sylvian's transformation of Ryuichi Sakamoto's \\"Theme for Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence\\" (now called \\"Forbidden Colours\\"); \\"Jean the Birdman\\" from The First Day, a Fripp/Sylvian album; and the beautiful, jazzy, transcendent \\"Orpheus.\\"  And those are just a few of the many pleasures contained within this set.<br /><br />In the past, I've sometimes used these customer reviews to rail against the greed of record companies (and sometimes artists too) for endlessly repackaging the same material to make an extra buck.  That doesn't really apply here, however, even though there have been other previous Sylvian comps, including 2010's Sleepwalkers and 2000's Everything and Nothing.  I have both of those, but (a) the 2010 CD focused more narrowly on DS's collaborations, and (b) there are fewer than a dozen songs on Victim (of 29 total) that were also on E&N, and in any case that album has dropped from the catalog now.  My only complaints with Victim are that it could have used more detailed credits, and that the final third of the 2nd disc is drawn from Sylvian's more experimental recent work.  I understand the reason for that -- otherwise Victim wouldn't be \\"career-spanning.\\"  Yet the newer material, including \\"Where's Your Gravity?,\\" the album's one previously unreleased track, gives the collection a feeling of drifting away into emptiness at the end.  On the credits issue, I'm thinking of giving this as a gift to a friend who's not as familiar with DS's work as I am.  If she wants to learn who played the instruments on these songs, I guess she'll have to do an internet search.  The CD insert (it cannot even be called a \\"booklet\\") has minimal information.ave to do an internet search.  The CD insert (it cannot even be called a \\"booklet\\") has minimal information.

1594203334|5.0|I finished reading this book in a week and started to implement the 3 meals a day with 1 snack immediately. I did however modify the dinner time to 4 and snack at 8. My 1-1/2 year old daughter has accepted it well and is no longer an addict to the fridge & constant snacking. It has made our lives so much more enjoyable. We don't have to worry about packing tons of snacks or any for that matter when we go on outings & it's so much less stressful. I have to say it is a lot of work though.  I am constantly planning a meal and looking for new recipes but I expect this to get easier as time goes on.  Plus she is eating much better with a broader menu of foods so I am not complaining. I have also made it a point to have my daughter say hello and goodbye as book mentions along with other manners. I am so glad that I was able to read this book while my kids are still young.  I have recommended to many friends and family. Thanks for a great read!

B0072GPQ72|4.0|Trailers for \\"War Horse\\" reminded me that I hadn't seen anything of Spielberg's in a while, lately. He had taken some time off, I suppose, and he had returned this year with two films, the animated \\"Adventures of Tintin\\" (which I had no interest in seeing), and \\"War Horse\\", an adaptation of a British stage show, which had just come to Broadway. Admittedly, \\"War Horse\\" is not my kind of film, yet, when a film is made correctly, it doesn't have to be one's cup of tea for that person to thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is overstuffed with emotion and pathos, sweeping beautiful landscapes, and a narrative that is pieced together in an interestingly non-traditional way, considering how old-fashioned it is, as a whole. Almost everything about this film is old fashioned, throwing back to a different generation of filmmaking that our generation had seemingly forgotten how to do. A film like this hasn't been done in a while, which made the overall tone kind of refreshing in a weird way.<br /><br />\\"War Horse\\" is the story of a boy and his pet horse. It is set in pre World War I Britain, and follows the horse as he is sold to be in the war, and the question is \\"will he ever make it home again?\\" The film follows the beautiful thoroughbred and for an animal character, we learn a lot about him over the course of the film. He reminds the men in the war of their humanity, and moves the hearts of everybody.<br /><br />The film is almost sickeningly wholesome, but it's going for the heartwarming, tearjerker effect, and it for the most part, nails it. Spielberg can make anything work, and here is why. This film is not my cup of tea. I don't particularly care for war films that aren't crazily unrealistic (ex. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" as one that I adored), and depict the setting realistically - but this isn't really a war film at all. While hundreds of men are dying in this war, the horse is symbolic. He reminds them that some things in the world are not hopeless, and there may be a better day to come.<br /><br />While John William's beautiful score and the obvious attention to imagery that is played certainly help, the film doesn't have any big-name actors to back it up - but it doesn't need them. It also is about 30 minutes too long. I understand it wanted to achieve what is thought of as \\"epic\\" length (146 minutes), but I can think easily of four scenes off the top of my head that dragged the plot along longer than it should have. In a lot of ways, the double-narrative following two stories that eventually DO come together in the end is gimmicky and done-before, but I was able to forgive it being slightly contrived, because the final product is quite nice.<br /><br />In the end, some parts of this movie are emotionally brutal and difficult to watch, but it has a very nice and beautiful ending that redeems it. While I wouldn't call this a \\"must see\\" kind of movie, it was a very nice way to spend a few hours in the dead of winter. Don't forget the tissues, though.<br /><br />Grade: B
B001ECQ4HG|4.0|Even if you didn't know ahead of time, it would be easy to figure out that Quentin Tarantino wrote the script for this visceral and stylistic dark comedy.  Clarence (Christian Slater) is a lonely clerk at a comic book store in a crummy section of Detroit.  It's his birthday so what does he do?  He takes in a triple feature of Sonny Chiba movies at the local cinema.  In the middle of the showing, a provocative beautiful girl \\"bumps\\" into him in the nearly empty theater.  It turns out that Alabama (Patricia Arquette) is a hooker who's been on the job only 4 days (and 3 tricks) and was sent to \\"meet\\" Clarence by his thoughtful boss.  They spend the night together and fall in love.  Yes, it feels real.  They are both sober and they believe it's true romance, so they get married.<br /><br />In order to free Alabama from her pimp (an over-the-top crazy Gary Oldman), Clarence, courageous but not so smart, confronts him.  It doesn't go well and Clarence ends up taking out Drexl (Oldman) and his henchman.  Thinking it is Alabama's suitcase, he departs with a million dollars worth of cocaine (street value).  Eventually they go to Los Angeles where a boyhood chum (Michael Rapaport), who is a struggling actor, will hopefully help him sell the coke.  Unfortunately the mob is on their trail as well as the police.  A concluding scene explodes in violence.<br /><br />Directed by Tony Scott, the film is full of brilliantly written and delivered small scenes.  In one scene, just after Clarence and Alabama depart for L. A., Clarence's father (Dennis Hopper) is paid a visit by the mob boss consigliore (Christopher Walken).  Their interaction is priceless.  In another small role, Brad Pitt plays the stoner roommate of Dick (Rapaport).  In just a couple well written scenes, he's able to show his comedic side.  The film isn't all a light-hearted affair however.  In a hard to watch scene, Alabama is viciously beat up by one of the mobsters (James Gandolfini). Preceding the great \\"Pulp Fiction\\" by a year, \\"True Romance\\" remains one of the best films of the genre.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is pretty good but not great.  I don't think the original prints were updated much, so while better than the DVD, the video isn't demo quality.  The sound, certainly improved with the Dolby TruHD give some nice ambient effects.  I've always liked the Hans Zimmer soundtrack and it's even better here.  There are numerous extras including 3 commentaries, selective scene commentaries, deleted and extended scenes with commentary, an alternate ending with commentary, a featurette and more.ion\\" by a year, \\"True Romance\\" remains one of the best films of the genre.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer is pretty good but not great.

0670022950|4.0|I like all of Pinker's books.  He is a very good writer / psychologist.  My only qualification is his politics.  When his analysis conflicts with his politics, he dances around inconvenient conclusions.  When his analysis supports his politics, he does not hesitate to drive home his point.  I think Jonathan Haidt has much better, deeper, honest understanding of how this dynamic works.
B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|The amazing Steven Soderbergh directs and elevates another film genre. Specifically, \\"B\\" movies that focus on espionage, intrigue and high action martial arts fighting. In an unusual mixture of actors, he brings in former MMA superstar and calendar girl Gina Carano as the headliner. She plays an agent for hire who works for one of those Blackwater-type firms that do a lot of the foreign dirty work for Uncle Sam. For some reason, she is believed to be expendable and is used as a pawn in a double-cross to kill a Chinese journalist in Spain.<br /><br />Unlike, the lithe Zoe Saldana in \\"Columbiana\\", Ms Carano is tall, firm and fully packed. The daughter of a former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, the beautiful fighter is very believable. She appears to be doing all of her own stunt work and from what I can discern without the aid of wiring and other devices. For example, in a rooftop chase she doesn't just leap up to grab a roof and catapult herself to the top. You can see the effort in her face. She's really doing this stuff! Her MMA skills also come into play with obvious boxing training. And you have to love it when she does a figure-4-leg-lock (sorry, I don't know the official name for the hold) around some guy's neck. She needs to get comfortable with the acting component of her new career, but she is far from terrible.<br /><br />Soderbergh also manages to bring into the mix an assortment of \\"A\\" list actors, who must have been begging to have their asses kicked by this girl. Michael Douglas is the government man (CIA?) who hires the mercenaries headed by Ewan McGregor and who is Mallory's (Carano) boss. Bill Paxton is her dad. Michael Fassbender (his scenes with Carano are priceless) is a rogue MI:6 agent. Channing Tatum is a co-worker and part time lover. Antonio Banderas is a middle man playing both sides. The plot isn't overly complicated and even makes sense but no one should confuse this movie as an Oscar contender or even the caliber of the new \\"Mission: Impossible\\" film, but it is fun, fast and furious and highly recommended.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (8-31-12): In this re-look at this terrific Soderbergh coming out party for Gina Carano, I'll focus on the Blu ray version.  The film looks terrific featuring scenes from hotel rooms to the ocean to bustling cities to the Colorado mountains.  Soderbergh presents a color palette unlike other films of the genre.  He's not afraid to use hues of yellow and brown mixed in with the usual basics.  The film has a 1080p transfer with an aspect ratio of 2.40:1.  The audio mix is also excellent with a lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix.  When I first saw this film I overlooked an early scene when Mallory (Carano) and her 3 partners rescue a Chinese journalist in Barcelona.  When a gunfight begins, the gun shots and bullet hits are muted to the extent they are dull thuds.  This allows the retro jazzy soundtrack to play loud and clear.  Very cool as is the whole movie.  The disc only has two extras and they total 21 minutes.  One is called \\"Gina Carano in Training\\" and the second is \\"The Men of Haywire.\\"  I'd upgrade the film to 4.5 stars.ble\\" film, but it is fun, fast and furious and highly recommended.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (8-31-12): In this re-look at this terrific Soderbergh coming out party for Gina Carano, I'll focus on the Blu ray version.

B003EYVXYQ|2.0|Is this all that George Romero can do?  That is, make zombie movies.  Granted, I was a fan of a couple but this one is really poorly done.  Perhaps that could have been expected under some circumstances  but he actually directs this mess.  Unknown actors show why they are unknown.  We have the usual suspects, i.e. studly macho dude, Latino, dorky guy and hot chick of mixed race square off against the zoms and some latent Irish tribes on an island off the Delaware coast.  Poor direction, editing, acting and story pretty much sums it up.  It did have a few new zombie killing tricks but overall lacks tension and everything else that makes up a satisfying film.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer and the DTS-HD Master Audio are both first rate.  No problems there.  There is also a plethora of special features to make most viewers happy.

B0021L8V0W|4.0|Who would have ever though 12 years ago that perhaps the best action stars of their generation would be Matt Damon and Angelina Jolle?  Salt essentially is a \\"Bourne\\" movie with a female lead.  Evelyn Salt can kick ass as well as anyone and that is pretty much what she does.  The film doesn't promise to be a thinking man's (or woman's) story and has no pretenses.  It is, however a really well done action movie with a star that proves that her stunt work is as good as her acting and her looks.  Packaged up with some standout support from Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor this is how action movies should be made.  Granted, the plot is pretty ridiculous and I was able to figure out the ultimate twist early on.  Still I liked it very much.<br /><br />This Blu ray transfer approaches some of the best quality that can be seen.  Likewise for the DTS-HD Master Audio.  There are several opportunities to show off a good system with a 360 degree soundfield.

B006OB3K56|4.0|In this lurid tale of sexual addiction, director and co-writer Steve McQueen teams up again with Michael Fassbender (\\"Hunger\\"). Brandon (Fassbender) is a moderately successful sales manager that outwardly appears to be just a regular single guy in Manhattan. Behind closed doors (or open windows) he can't get enough sex. If he can't get it by picking up girls, he will resort to prostitutes or internet porn. If that's inconvenient, then there's the old fashion do it yourself method. He has no interest in relationships. In the one tryst he has with a co-worker who wants something beyond sex, Brandon can't pull the trigger. There's something clearly wrong with this guy.<br /><br />His life becomes complicated when his sister (Carey Mulligan in another terrific performance) shows up at his apartment uninvited. Their initial encounter when he walks in on her in the shower alerts us that something is amiss. He has an unusually long conversation with her as she stands before him in all her full frontal glory. Hmm. The siblings couldn't be more different. Brandon is almost a recluse. He socializes but only if there is a chance for sex. Sissy (Mulligan) is talkative, effervescent and looking for fun. She is a troubled soul however.<br /><br />We see this initially when Brandon and his boss (James Badge Dale, TV's \\"Rubicon\\") go to a club where Sissy has a gig singing. In a featured scene she sings a sorrowful rendition of \\"New York, New York\\" that brings a tear to Brandon...and me. In another scene, Sissy cuddles up to Brandon in the middle of the night. He rightfully throws her out but why would she do that? In another scene, she says to him \\"we are not bad people; we just come from a bad place.\\" Certainly a history of incest is suggested as the cause of their psychological damage. Unfortunately, McQueen does little to flesh out this cause and effect background.<br /><br />The film is graphically presented in terms of language, nudity and sexual activity earning the NC-17 rating. The performances by Fassbender and Mulligan are special and worthy of awards. Many people will have trouble watching this film for a variety of reasons.

B005OYKI1I|1.0|This is not a review of the movie. There are enough reviews already on Amazon to decide if you would like to see the actual movie or not. This is a review on the \\"Extended Version\\" of this movie. You would have to pay close attention to see where the movie was actually extended. It adds a few frames and  has slight differences that cause the movie to be about 70 seconds longer than the original and only slightly different in some scenes (different angles, etc.). This website shows the differences for each scene---- www (dot) movie-censorship (dot)com/report (dot) php?ID=149783 . It seems to me that the extended version doesn't add much that theatrical version doesn't already have and what is added doesn't seem to make it better.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|This review is not about this particular novel.  It is about the Jack Reacher series.  I started with #1 and am now in the middle of the last one.  The plots are usually somewhat complex with one or more subplots.  The writing and pace keep me interested.  For only one story was I able to figure out what was happening before Reacher did.  Some of the fight scenes that last under five seconds can take several pages to describe - the way Reacher describes what is going on for each fraction of a second is a little much.  I often wonder how Reacher can stay is such good fighting form without exercise or training.  But when the next Reacher novel is out, I'm getting it.  I suggest you read #1.  If you like it, you will like all of them.  If you don't like it, you won't like the others either.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book for two purposes--I teach 7th grade and several students were reading it and on the recommendation of a friend.  IT was fabulous!  I could not put it down!  It had me anxious to go to the next page at every turn of the book.  it is well written, (certainly on a level that adults would read also).  I loved the character developments and the suspense.  I would tell anyone that likes to read to read it quickly--before the movie arrives in March.  I knew this was part of a trilogy so I had ordered all 3 books.  Book two is just as good and picks up exactly where book one ended.  I also give it rave reviews.  The third book (not quite done with it yet) is not as good of a read but I will wait to comment till i have finished it.

I felt the author really made the characters come alive, however, I thought the ending was a big disappointment.  I did not feel the author led me to the conclusion nor did it seem realistic as compared to the rest of the story.

0525478817|4.0|I enjoyed The Fault in Our Stars but I did not love it. Hazel, the book's main character, has terminal cancer and much of the book is about her journey and struggles. It's also filled with many funny and vibrant characters, but I found Hazel very difficult to relate to. Overall, I found the characters to be very dynamic and wise beyond their years because many of them are cancer survivors. On the other hand, the characters, especially the gorgeous Augustus, were not very believable. The beginning of the book started a little slow for my taste, but after it picked up, I could not put it down. The combination of a love story and struggle for survival is sure to keep you turning the page. I recommend this book for an uplifting, sad, suspenseful, funny read.
0545265355|5.0|They had so much potential to be one of my favorite epic trilogies.  However, for sticking to the \\"young adult\\" genre, they were excellent reads.  I was left wanting (and hanging at times) for more, but they're still quite good and worth reading.  I'm just hoping the movie doesn't go all \\"Twilight\\".
B006QANR5I|5.0|I love the continuation of the story line & I especially love Maggie Smith \\"Violet\\" she reminds me of so many of my \\"Old Aunts\\"<br /><br />Please keep the story as interesting as it has been; I have seen series 1 & @ 2 and the Christmas story loved them all
B0052U59F4|5.0|I have never stayed up so late reading a book!  I finished this book and am glad I read the review for the second book and bought it at the same time.  WOW is all I can say.  This book held my attention from the first chapter.  I would give it 6 stars if I could!!
B0071PS7AC|3.0|So the game is functional and has fluid graphics but the tracking of cash and the premise established in the description take away from what could be a good game. The developer could have used the &quot;cash&quot; earned to unlock other balls or something. Better yet he could've just not included the vegas theme at all... Bottom line is that if there is a cheaper game that does the same thing than you should pass this one up, unless you scored this as the app of the day that is.
0545265355|5.0|AWESOME, Highly recommend this series to anyone. Should definitely read this before seeing the movie. The trailer makes a lot more sense after reading the book.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|My wife Marilyn and I recently wren-ted this movie from Amazon.com. Watching this movie was a real lark. Marilyn is still raven about it. It swan the movie finished and the credits flicker-ed on the screen that she said it was the best movie she had ever seen. But you know merlin - heron her birds. With her years of birding experience, her views are a bit skua-d. She's not jay-ded, but she can be somewhat gull-ible. But I shouldn't harrier, and I shouldn't grouse about her opinion or snipe at her views. There's really a lot to crow about in this movie. With a cast starling three comic actors (Steve Martin, Owen Wilson, and Jack Black), swift dialogue, and exquisite bird photos to loon credibility, the movie can hardly fal,con it? Many of the  scenes and lines were laugh-out-loud funny, owl admit. The big year birders are amazingly competitive and cuckoo in their quest to identify the greatest number of birds in one year. They are guilty of several cardinal sins, puffin with pride, envy, and covetousness. Fortunately, the movie ended on an upbeat note as high as a kite in the wind. (SPOILER ALERT): Wilson's character couldn't duck the consequences of his obsession, his marriage went off the rails, he won the booby prize of a divorce, and went limpkin off to China. But happily, Martin's character and Black's character didn't quail before their defeat and were not sora losers. They put their egrets behind them and kept their personal and family priorities straight. After all, toucan usually do better than one. With a movie as good as this, let osprey that they will soon make a seagull.
B001U7B4T8|1.0|I was at this concert. I too have been waiting 20 years for an honest to goodness release of a DVD of the entire concert. Sadly the 2 CD set lacks some of the songs from the show as well. George Harrison doing \\"If Not For You\\" and George Thorogood did a killer song I only heard that night . I have never Bob sing it. It must be a rarity . I have almost every Dylan album and I don't know where else it could be. It reminds me a lot of Johnny Cash's \\"I've Been Everywhere Man\\" . It has been 20 years so some of the other songs not on the CD evade my memory. Booker T and The MGs showcased some stuff on their own. I look all the time for a DVD of the entire show. It is the one void in my extensive music collection. It was a privilege being able to see that show and have a good seat in the Garden. So , Please Bob, iron out the legal mumbo jumbo and let us own the entire show on DVD.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I read the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and I got hooked. My review for this book would be based on that factor.<br />I think  book #2 of the 3 is Very Good but, it was heavy laden with unnecessary politics.I think Stieg Larsson could have got to the point with less verbiage and more action.<br /><br />The main attraction about these books is Slander and there was not enough about her. Per The New York Times, \\"Lisbeth Salander is one of the most original characters in a thriller to come along in a while.\\" I really like Mikael Blomkvist; however, I could care less about all his sex.<br /><br />My option about this book is the same as what I would say about The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|Good graphics, decent controls.  Someone said there weren't instructions, just touch the little pulldown icon in the top left side of the screen.  definately one to try out.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Adele is so wonderful and beautiful and talented and...I could go on and on.  This blu-ray DVD brings her soul and passion and humor into your living room with such clarity and perfection - I'm definitely a big fan of Blu-Ray now, but I digress.  Adele is so very funny.  She'll have you laughing one moment and crying the next.  Her emotion is so raw and she just puts it all out there on the table.  There's nothing fake about her and she deserves all the success that has come her way and I know that things will just continue to be awesome for her!  When my wife first heard her song \\"Chasing Pavements\\" she said to me, \\"Wow, she's gonna be a huge success, just watch.\\"  I was a bit skeptical but she was absolutely correct in her prediction.  I really hope she tours the U.S. soon.  To see her LIVE in person would no doubt be the most awesome experience - next to seeing Wicked (which we've seen twice).  :-)  If you are having any doubts at all about purchasing this DVD - rest assured, you will NOT be disappointed.  I was sad when it was over.
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|As for the service and delivery i have absolutely no complaints. The only thing that i was upset about was the way the disks are enclosed I was about to take out the first disk and it broke so now i cant watch the first disk. The disks need to be placed diferently!
B0053O89KG|5.0|Way back in the day, I watched Bruce Willis in Moonlighting and fell in love with the kind of comedy and relationship that now sizzles and pops between Detective Kate Beckett and novelist Richard Castle.<br /><br />Beckett and Castle are two beautiful people with a few scars and flaws that makes them believably human. (Like the play on names, too.)<br /><br />Castle's devotion to his daughter and his relationship with his quirky actress mother add dimension and depth and more ways to have fun in this television series. Kate's strong, by-the-book behavior is the perfect foil for Richard Castle's 12-year-old boyish ways (even though he is WAY past that age and has a daughter older than that.) He has a Peter Pan syndrome that alternates with responsible father, man-about-town, famous writer, and loving son, not to mention a strong and worthy civilian partner for homocide detective -- Kate who has her own closet full of secrets and designer clothing.<br /><br />I came to this series late, but fell hard and fast for this unorthodox crime fighting duo. Just watched an episode from season 4 and can't wait to get my hands on the DVD. Send it Amazon! Send it soon!<br /><br />I have seasons 1-3 and the episodes are definitely re-watchable. Quality production all the way. Great ensemble cast. Can't think of anything that I can find fault with. The humor is perfect, the chemistry just steamy enough and the sweet family relationships are just quirky enough to add spice. The 'family' at the precinct add balance and more pleasure.<br /><br />What can I say, this is one television series that has it all! Romance, suspense, action, adventure,and family! And the dialogue is smart and original. The plot twists fresh and often totally unexpected. A wonderful diversion from the cares of the world with some mystery and mayhem and for us writer types -- a wonderful subplot that explores book writing and funnels into our dreams of someday walking the red carpet for our book signings.gnings.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Forget the critics who believe this movie is an apology for terrorists. Ridley Scott is<br />in top form with this thought provoking action film.  A great cast and a great script make this one perfect for the home library.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|Was it mean that I took my hypochondriac buddy to this film and now he won't leave his house? With CONTAGION, director Steven Soderbergh presents an alarmingly believable account of how a global pandemic might fall out. It's frightening how vulnerable and exposed we all are to catching a virus. The slightest contact... listen, I'm no germaphobe but I'm calling a moratorium on chest bumps with my homies.<br /><br />I've always been fascinated with bio-thriller films, from 1971's The Andromeda Strain to 1995's Outbreak (Keep Case Packaging). I eat up that aspect of the science procedural. Soderbergh lifts his TRAFFIC formula and applies it to CONTAGION. We track an ensemble cast composed of A-list stars as they travel down their respective (and interconnected) story arcs. Not that the virus gives a what that these are some of Hollywood's most recognizable names. It kills all its victims impersonally. And I think that was Soderbergh's point. No one is immune (except, as it turns out, for one person).<br /><br />Hong Kong has given us a wealth of classic kung fu movies. It's provided the backdrop to THE WORLD OF SUSIE WONG. Some of the tallest, most scintillating skyscrapers can be found in Hong Kong. But Hong Kong is also where this supremely malevolent viral strain originates. From Hong Kong, CONTAGION follows a traveling American businesswoman (Gwyneth Paltrow) - who later the medical community would designate as &#34;Patient Zero&#34; - for as long as she's around (she's not around long), as well as the people with whom she comes into contact (they're not around for long, either). From these carriers, the disease multiplies and mutates and infects and infects and infects. In the U.S. alone, the casualties soon number in the millions.<br /><br />The World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control soon deploy their brightest scientific minds (Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet, Jennifer Ehle, and Marion Cotillard) to backtrack the virus to its source, limit its impact, and arrive at a successful treatment protocol. Except that these doctors find themselves running into further obstacles. As with other disaster films, man's innate asshatness comes into play. Mass panic, riots, lootings, violence, politics... these are all our favorite pastimes when facing apocalypse. Soderbergh, almost with a dispassionate eye, weaves several plot threads in concert, these different perspectives coalescing into a clinical blanket study on how one uncontrollable pathogen can generate a global collapse.<br /><br />It's really interesting viewing. Only, I wish it impacted the viewer on a more emotional level (and I don't mean the primal fear that this movie immediately invokes). Soderbergh keeps his characters low-key. You'd expect that from the cast of doctors and scientists, all of whom are trained to maintain a detached and analytic mindset. I will say that one of the most heartbreaking moments in this film is what happens to one dedicated epidemiologist when she catches the bug. Soderbergh is again driving home a point here. The epidemiologist's corpse is disposed of in a massive grave filled with other infected corpses. The stark anonymity of this is sobering and so sad.<br /><br />Even Matt Damon's character - who as the husband of &#34;Patient Zero&#34; represents the Everyman - for the most part adheres to repressed behavior. I did like those moments in which Damon's character lets his emotions out. I wish he'd done it more. I wish that Soderbergh had done more with Damon, had played more with that one aspect which makes Damon's character unique. The most spirited (and unlikable) role goes to Jude Law who adopts a snaggletooth and plays a slimy blogging journalist. I couldn't wait for him to start coughing and sneezing...<br /><br />CONTAGION is a haunting and frightening cautionary tale. It's intelligent but sterile, harrowing but on an impersonal level. I did find myself connecting to some of the characters (Damon's Mitch, Winslet's Erin Mears, Fishburne's Cheever), but only up to a point. Perhaps the images that'll stay with me are those lingering camera shots of everyday objects such as doorknobs and drinking glasses and those standup poles on the bus... How do you refrain from touching those? My buddy still won't leave his house.<br /><br />The DVD's 2-minute-long bonus featurette: &#34;CONTAGION: How a Virus Changes the World&#34; - a quick but informative tutorial on infectious viruses and the protocols in place to deal with them.et's Erin Mears, Fishburne's Cheever), but only up to a point.

1451673442|5.0|As a huge fan of both The Secret and The Power, I was hoping that The Magic would continue the 'story' of how the more spiritual side to life can help you really make huge changes that action alone won't accomplish. Well, I wasn't disappointed, and the 'magic' of gratitude that this book outlines is clearly laid out - not only in the text, but also the exercises.<br /><br />Since The Secret came out, I've tried to make the law of attraction part of my life, despite what my family think of it! The great thing with being more grateful, and being thankful for who and what you already have in your life, is that, even if you don't believe the 'hype' that surrounds the marketing around Rhonda Byrne's books - then you're still going to positively impact your life just by doing so. I'd put this right up there with my other favorite abundance mindset book of the moment - Gary Vurnum's excellent [[ASIN:B007EPC0AM Out Of Debt, Out Of Mind. The Simple 8 Step Plan To Change Your Relationship With Money, Wealth And Success Forever!]]. The Magic is highly recommended, and a worthy addition to any Law of Attraction library!

B004JN1D2I|1.0|How is it that the Kindle version is more expensive than the paperback edition??? Unbelievable! The whole selling point for digital readers such as the Kindle was that the e-books were suppose to be cheaper.

0439023491|5.0|The book came in an extraordinary presentation. For the fans of the trilogy I really recommend it. I am very satisfied because I live outside the US and asked for an expedite-shipment.

630542828X|5.0|As I am finishing replacing my last 100 commercial vhs tapes with dvd's, the question is always \\"do I want/need to see this again?\\"  I pondered this with A Civil Action and decided that especially since it is NEVER on any of the movie channels, I should replace it with a dvd.  SO glad I did.<br /><br />Unlike the happier endings given to us in truly memorable films like The Verdict and Erin Brokavich, A Civil Action gives us what usually happens in such lawsuits - they go on for years and years, with no resolution, until the plaintiff dies or just quits in frustration.<br /><br />I am a huge John Travolta fan, but even I was surprised with the depth of character he touches in his portrayal of Jan Schlichtmann: arrogant, cocky and yet ultimately committed to a cause he did not go looking for.<br /><br />Robert Duvall is as wonderful and effortless as ever.  Despite his character being on the \\"wrong\\" side, his portrayal forces the viewer to make the distinction between the job a person does and who the person is.<br /><br />This is a subtle little gem that I almost let slip away from me.  That would have been a real shame.

B004LWZW8S|1.0|This movie was pretty poor. Worse, Fox Sports has decided to overlay a delayed ad over their MLB page for this amazon page. Every time I try to click on a link I get sent here instead, then have to go back to the fox page, close the ad, and then click on the link I really wanted to read. I guess such a boring movie really needs to force people over to Amazon to have any hope of selling its blu rays, eh?

B0039UTDFG|5.0|Must watch series! Amazing!<br /><br />And my personal opinion (like it or not):<br /><br />Thanks to Oprah's narration for bringing this used/like new Blu-ray 4-disc set to a reasonable price (11 bucks): 3 times less expensive than version with David Attenborough's voice, who was the only drawback for me on the amazing \\"Planet Earth\\" series, BTW. Sorry, he is too old now to enjoy his pronunciation despite of his knowledge and enthusiasm, I'd prefer Matt Damon's voice on the \\"Planet Earth\\" and \\"Life\\". Oprah Winfrey is not not the best narrator, indeed, but it's OK. With this stunning cinematography the narration is secondary for me, for information only. Thanks to set editors for the option to switch to music only mode without voice. If I need to know geographical location or animal/bird/etc name I can briefly turn subtitles on. Most of things on the set are quite clear and understandable just watching them without detailed explanation and/or human voice intervention.<br /><br />Again, it's IMHO.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Can't believe how many bad reviews this movie was getting in the beginning. Just goes to show why mindless horror/gore movies and the constant regurgitating of \\"Fast and Furious\\", and movies of its type can be done over and over again and still get people to come to them. Some people apparantly don't like anything different and out of the ordinary. They would prefer to see movies with constant cliches (Avatar, etc.) to the point where you know exactly what is going to happen and what is going to be said. A generation of no imagination.<br />Easily one of the the best movies of last year. Much like \\"All Good Things\\" with Gosling in it, very underrated.<br />I would say if you are like the masses and like/go to most movies that come to theaters (can't miss that latest Adam Sandler movie), etc. then you may not like this one, but if you are looking for a change and a movie with style, etc. then this is def. one of the best.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is superfun and entertaining. I love the quest mode where you get the artifacts.it is very easy to play, their instructions are pretty clear.the app runs pretty smooth.definitely worth it.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|The worst movie I have ever seen for the hype given (and just one of the worst overall). Just terrible acting and one long cliche from start to finish.<br />Awful digital effects/graphics. Looked like cartoons mixed with people.

0062502182|5.0|Reading the alchemist will change your life. Plain and simple. After reading this book, you will see the world in a different way. The funny thing is, author Paulo Coelho doesn't tell you anything you already don't know. He merely reminds you of things you may have forgotten.<br /><br />  Readers will follow the story of Santiago, a Spanish shepherd whose simple  outlook and courage to define his own life leads to an expedition to Egypt to find treasure. However, this is more than just a journey. Santiago is following his \\"Personal Legend.\\" This is the idea that every person has a set goal or destiny that they can choose to or not to pursue. Whether you believe in this concept or not, the book has a lot to offer. I would argue the main message of this novel is to overcome the obstacles of success and chase one's dreams. Our main problem is that in our materialistic society, we get so caught up in our day to day struggles that we forget what we really want, who we really are. The Alchemist reminds us of our most innocent and juvenile aspirations, and that simply trying to achieve those dreams will bring us closer to happiness.<br /><br />  Another excellent message in The Alchemist is the focus on simplicity. The main character, whilst on his travels, realizes that there is really only one language to the universe. The concept that communication between all living things has a language is another great one to ponder.  Coelho enlightens the reader with many of these insights as they read through the novel, some more abstract than others. Belief in destiny and in God is very prevalent throughout the book, but the message applies to the less religious as well. As Santiago continues on his spiritual journey, he is changed by the experiences he has and the people he meets. And so too, is the reader. Some believe that materialistic success is overemphasized in the novel, with many of the characters finding happiness through wealth. While most of the novel can be read for its literal value, without much interpretation, I believe that with regards to wealth and treasure, Coelho doesn't necessarily mean that monetary success will bring you happiness. Rather, the real treasure comes from our experiences and learning, and that knowing ourselves and the world around us better will bring us true happiness.<br /><br />  A real treasure to read, I can highly recommend this book to anyone. The language is simple, and the story is a real breeze, but the messages learned in the story will linger in your mind long after finishing the novel. The book is titled The Alchemist, and while there are alchemists in the story, the book itself practices alchemy, changing those who read it into something different. While you may not necessarily agree or believe in everything that Coelho writes, you will come closer to understanding yourself, and the world around you, and according to Coelho, closer to finding your Personal Legend. And isn't that all we're really searching for?
B0064BWE8U|4.0|I've been an avid fan of Sophie Kinsella ever since I first read Confessions of a Shopaholic (published in the UK as The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic) and identified a little bit too much with Rebecca Bloomwood. Since then, I've read almost all of Kinsella's books (the only ones I haven't read are the ones she originally published under a pen name and is now re-releasing under her own name). I've enjoyed them all and I've Got Your Number is no exception*.<br /><br />By now, I've got Kinsella's formula down to a science. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and in fact, I like that I know what I can expect. This especially helps in the middle of the book when I'm getting really frustrated at all the crap that's going down, until I realize that this is Kinsella. It's going to have a happy ending.<br /><br />So, Poppy Wyatt, as the typical Kinsella heroine, is more your average Jane. She, like the others, is someone you can identify with...she's not the prettiest nor the smartest, but a likeable, plucky girl. Enter the mishap that screws it all up: she loses her engagement ring. Things go from bad to worse, to a little bit better, than worse again, than really, really, really worse and that's when you know you're somewhere in the middle of the book and the beginnings of a happy ending are just around the corner. There's the usual Kinsella hero...slightly rough around the edges, but actually a rather decent bloke underneath it all.<br /><br />I have to give it to Kinsella...she almost had me. There was a moment (I won't spoil it) when I was absolutely perplexed and could NOT believe it was going to end this way...and so I kept reading, keenly aware of the little % bar at the bottom of the Kindle screen telling me that I still had quite a bit to go. That gave me hope but I was still clicking the \\"page next\\" button a little too quickly.<br /><br />As with some of her other books, Kinsella seems to ask you for a certain level of \\"suspension of disbelief\\". Is it a little convenient that she finds a mobile phone in a rubbish bin? One that works? One that embroils her in a corporation's internal politics? Is it a little too much to ask the audience to buy that she's able to keep the phone for as long as she does and get away with even half of what she gets away with?<br /><br />Probably.<br /><br />But if you let Kinsella tell her story, it doesn't really matter. She has you turning the pages and rooting for Poppy all the way. All in all, I've Got Your Number is everything I go to Kinsella for and she does not disappoint. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Kinsella in the past and perhaps for readers, like me, who used to read Meg Cabot as a teenager.<br /><br />Nitpicking: I don't know how the actual hard copy is formatted, but the one issue I had with the Kindle edition was the footnotes were poorly done. In fact, they were not footnotes. They were endnotes. I was confused what the numbers throughout the chapters meant, not expecting footnotes in a work of fiction. Then when I got to the end of the first chapter, I realized that the numbers matched up. (Yes, I went to college...) I tried to read a footnote once, but I couldn't get back to my spot without some rapid page-turning. After that, I gave up and barely gave the footnotes any attention. It would have been better had I been able to actually read the footnotes as footnotes.<br /><br />*Twenties Girl is probably my favorite. :)convenient that she finds a mobile phone in a rubbish bin?

B007HJ84ZK|5.0|What is Game of Thrones?  It is the Godfather, the Sopranos, West Wing, the Spice Channel, Braveheart and Excalibur all thrown into one beautifully produced HBO series.  I haven't enjoyed a story this much since the original Star Wars saga 30+ years ago.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Catching Fire, the sequel to The Hunger Games, is a great follow-up that carries the momentum of the series well. Like its predecessor, it's action-packed but this time it features more District 12, more Gale, and more insidious politics.<br /><br />It was refreshing to see Katniss in her hometown and to be able to see how being a Victor has or hasn't changed her. The moment of defiance in the Games has planted a seed---not only throughout the districts but in Katniss herself.<br /><br />The only grievance that I really had with Catching Fire was the Quarter Quell, or as I see it, the rehashing of the events in Hunger Games. I realize that the Quarter Quell was unique in that it had a secret goal (SPOILERS: The Capitol wants to kill Katniss), but I kept thinking up until the Quarter Quell started that Collins was going to be really sneaky and whisk Katniss and Peeta away and the plot would change direction.<br /><br />But it didn't.<br /><br />However, that being said, I loved the tributes in the Quarter Quell so much. More of them were fleshed-out characters than the last one and this made the Quell much more interesting. I did like the plot twist at the very, very end. In fact, I would say that the introduction of new characters and the plot twist saved me from being too terribly annoyed with the rehashing of the Games.<br /><br />My one other complaint was that the romance started to feel a bit more contrived in the last book. I started to feel less and less that the love triangle wasn't just a sensationalist attempt on the part of Collins.<br /><br />The middle of any trilogy has a responsibility to keep alive the interest from the first installment and carry it forth so that the reader is interested in the finale. Usually, the middle of a trilogy is usually darker, so as to up the stakest In these aspects, Catching Fire succeeded. At least, for me. Overall, I really enjoyed reading this and I'm excited to read Mockingjay.<br /><br />P.S.- I caught the use of \\"reoccurring\\" in this book...how could the editors have missed this?!eoccurring\\" in this book...how could the editors have missed this?!

B005EGXTEE|5.0|With all the hype surrounding The Hunger Games and a film adaptation on its way, I decided to finally check it out and bought it for my Kindle. Comparisons between Twilight and its Edward vs. Jacob had already crossed my radar, as I knew fans of The Hunger Games were already fiercely debating between Peeta and Gale. Also in my mind was its \\"Young Adult\\" category, but I'm not ashamed to admit that I quite enjoy reading \\"YA\\" books. Last summer, I felt like I was re-living my childhood by reading quite a few YA fantasy books. Furthermore, I knew that this was branded as \\"dystopian science-fiction\\", which brings to mind 1984, Equilibrium, The Truman Show, and other such \\"dystopian\\" worlds with which I am familiar. Lord of the Flies is another comparison I'd make, as it involves the isolation of young people with horrific and barbaric results.<br /><br />Anyway, with all these preconceptions in mind, it took awhile to get \\"lost\\" in the book. After three or four chapters, I felt like I had gotten the hang of it and was soon immersed in the world of Panem. Readers are introduced to District 12 through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl who effectively puts food on the table for her mother and younger sister by illegally hunting in the woods outside the fence that surrounds their district. The readers are dropped into the story on the day of \\"reaping\\", when the tributes are chosen to participate in the Hunger Games. It's interesting how Collins slowly reveals layers of information about Katniss, District 12, and even Panem itself. She doesn't provide too much too soon, which I liked. Collins splits her book into three parts and details the build-up to the Games through the reaping and the preparation of the tributes, the actual Games, and then finally, the end of the Games and the aftermath of the results.<br /><br />Interspersed throughout the glitz and glamor of the Capitol and the action-packed sequence of events in the Games itself are little hints of barbarism. I felt myself questioning what Collins was trying to say about society today, but ultimately the social commentary was few and far between. There are moments where I was hopeful that there would be some philosophic breakthrough, such as Peeta's desire to show the Gamemakers that he isn't just a mere pawn in their games.<br /><br />However, there weren't any follow-through moments as I didn't feel as if the Games actually fundamentally changed any of the characters. (Spoiler, perhaps?) I would have liked to see more character development with all of the characters. Perhaps one of the reasons none of the characters seemed to be affected by the Games is the fact that the population of Panem has been effectively desensitized to the violence over a period of 70+ years. Is this perhaps a warning towards desensitization in our own culture, with violence being prevalent in news stories, film/television, and video games?<br /><br />That being said, I thought that the love story was well done. Without revealing too much for those who haven't read the series, I liked how it evolved and the love triangle didn't feel contrived to me, as with Edward/Bella/Jacob in the Twilight series. Additionally, I think that Katniss provides a strong role model for young female readers of the series, which is always a good thing in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, Collins spins a great story and I turned each page eagerly, wanting to know more and anticipating what happens in Catching Fire and Mockingjay. The characters, whether likable or not, were engaging and the story is interesting enough to warrant further reading.m.

B0064J6OMO|3.0|This movie was very funny, but had a bit too much foul language, nudity & Sexual sense in it for me to really enjoy it. It was very disappointing to find these two actors (Jason Bateman & Ryan Reynolds) would act in a movie with such vulgar content. I really enjoy their movies in the past although Ryan is more likely to act in this movie then Jason. This movie would have been extremely funny if they would have toned it down on Ryan's role (the single guy) with all the sex and language. Basically the two guys (Jason - family man & Ryan - Single pot smoking/womanizer) switch bodies & try to deal with each others lives.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie for anyone that does not enjoy listening to bad language, nudity & sex senses cause there is at least 50%. If you don't mind all this then it is a very funny movie.
B0071PS7AC|5.0|runs smooth on the kindle fire..best bowling game I have played so far worth the 0.99 when its not free.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie was Excellent! I would recommend this movie to everyone although young children would not understand or really enjoy it. It is an adult movie with very little bad content. Very Funny but also made me cry. I walked away wondering how this movie touched all my senses so well. This is one I would watch more then once.<br /><br />Watch it, you will love it!

0670022411|5.0|I kind of feel like it's what would happen if Anne Rice and Diana Gabaldon wrote a book, except that it's better than the sum of it's parts. At first I felt it was a bit slow and then I realized that the author really wants you to savor this book. Not rush to the end, rush to the conclusion. You have to wait. I find that to be rather welcome, in a world of \\"have it now.\\"
B0055SWM08|5.0|fantastic! totally addictive!  Easy to understand the ultimate end, but gets harder to get there!  one to keep u up at night to play!  love it!

0545265355|5.0|I am not a huge reader, and at 40 years of age I thought this series was aimed at teens. How wrong I was, so much so I had read all three books in a week.<br /><br />After surpassing the first couple of chapters, obtaining the basic understanding of the storyline, I then struggled to put down each of the books. My wife went shopping, I went and found a corner in the shops to continue reading.<br /><br />I completely understand why book one is releasing the movie version this month, only hoping the trilogy is completed in movie form as well. Even with the movie coming, I am so glad to have the foundational knowledge of the book when watching the movie, as a movie doesn't require to be as descriptive as a book, thus much is missed in a movie within backdrops, moods and such which is explained within the book.<br /><br />My wife is now reading the series. Same problem again... once she started they are actually distracting her from doing her work. Constantly wanting to continue reading to find out what happens next.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is a genius at best in the way she and her team have written these books. Chapter after chapter, you are left hanging enough to be compelled towards the next chapter to find out.<br /><br />It really is just addictive, and I completely understand why this trilogy has been ranking in the top 100 books for near two years.

B0017SWSCW|5.0|Some feel British thrillers can be very descriptive and may move slowly. I found this kept moving at a steady pace, despite being very descriptive. It really does not bog down. In fact, I found the book difficult to put down.<br />I enjoyed the story. There are many twists & turns throughout which keeps the reader interested & entertained.<br />One basically knows good will triumph over evil. But. how the author gets to that point is enthralling. The courtroom dramas play out well without boredom.<br />I did find Danny's prison escape a bit \\"Over the top.\\" But, Mr. Archer does very well relating as to how he reaches that point of escape from Belmarsh Prison. Actually, the entire story is very well thought out. The editing for Kindle is very good as well. One of the best Kindle edits I've seen.<br />As mentioned earlier, the novel is gripping and really should not be missed
1400069289|5.0|Full disclosure-- I went to business school with Charles (who knew MBAs were such good writers!).  However if I didn't enjoy this book thoroughly I wouldn't be writing a review.  I found TPOH to be insightful and engaging.  The book also offers real world value/application by explaining what drives our habits -- to hopefully allow us to change them.  Very Malcolm Gladwell-esque -- that's a compliment!  I was also fascinated by Duhigg's reporting on the precise ways that companies use information about our behaviors to more effectively market to us.  A great read, and a must for people in the business world.

It's exactly what I thought it would be and fits perfectly in the space I wanted it for.
B006ZCWU5K|1.0|By far and away the most uninspired album the man has ever released.<br />I didn't think it was possible for this once wonderful songwriter, to release something worse than 'Working on a Dream'... just goes to show how wrong ya can be !.<br /><br />Sorry for the following cliche, but I'm one of those long time Springsteen fans,since I was 17 ,Im 47 now.<br />I have loved just about everything the man has released from 'Greetings' to 'Magic' , but found 'Working On A Dream' , completely underwhelming , still, maybe it was just a hiccup ?. No such luck !.<br />Nobody expects the man to re-invent himself , and indeed why would one want him too ? . Don't mess with perfection.<br />However the songs contained are a long way short of his previous standards.<br /><br />Take the first track , 'We Take Care Of Our Own' ,<br /> Please don't let me read again that Bruce is angry !!! , as i have done in 7 newspapers/rock mags  up to now , this is a tepid at best ,rehash of earlier glories , the lyrics are self plagiarised cliches, completely directionless and damn near ambigious , Bruce asks a lot of questions , (to get us thinking ?, Doh !) , but never attempts to come up with any answers , and that applies to this entire ''angry'' album .<br />Still how can we expect him to lay blame with the U.S. government ,or say anything radical, when he is practically sleeping with The Boss . Unintended bad pun.  Telling us that the Bankers are not a nice lot ,just does'nt cut the mustard. On top of this , the song is horribly over produced ,and whatever little edge ,or spark the tune may have had ,a smmoothed over and snuffed out , long before the halfway point , which is roughly where the song becomes a big friendly ,even more commercial, radio friendly sing-along.<br />Woah Bruce , Calm down, Calm down !!!  ?.<br />Right then , I was planning on expressing an opinion on a few of the others tracks , but as I'm no doubt angering some readers ,(most readers,we all know only the 'fan club' , will be reading this  ).... I will shut up shortly , But for anyone interested in hearing both sides of a disagreement , the rest of the tracks on the album are pretty much cut from the same template ,as 'We Take Care Of Our Own',  if that single floats your boat, buy the album . If not steer clear.<br />Ha, Im listening now ,and Bruce just asked me ''if i have the balls ? ''.  Maybe I should add an extra star to my review for it's humourous content  ;) .<br />I'll give the man this , it took some balls to include that risable photo in the CD booklet, the one with Bruce and the elderly gent, I won't try to describe it , just have a look for yourself and try not to throw up.<br />Lamentable !<br />I remain a fan of the first 30 years or so,  ... but do you remember those frustrating arguements you'd have , when some dimwit couldnt grasp the vastness between Springsteen and Bon Jovi ? . Head wrecking right ?. Well the good  news is that you won't ever have to go thru' it again ! .<br />Anyway ,judging from recent press releases , apparently Mr Springsteen has his sights set on being the new Bob Dylan ! ??????  .

B00526ZKYS|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  It is creepier and more terrifying than the other dystopian YA novels to me because it makes references to the world as we know it now.  The country they live in is the USA and they live in cities that exist today.  They have cell phones and they go to church.  Their world is eerily similar to ours, with a few major exceptions (of course).  I read this book in one day and immediately started reading the sequel.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes YA fiction.

B001IWELF4|5.0|It's important to say at the outset that the video and sound quality of this DVD are superb, and this for a re-release of a film done in the nineties.  The production itself is exquisite, with sets, cars, clothes, and dialogue that perfectly evokes the Los Angeles of 1953.  James Ellroy's book was long, tedious, loaded with subplots, and an interminable read.  The script for the film picks the strongest characters and subplots, reweaving them into a largely new story which stands on its own.  The last time I recall this happening was with The Godfather in 1971, and Mario Puzo collaborated on that screenplay.  It's a good thing Ellroy is nowhere to be found on the credits for this one.  LA Confidential is notable for being the US debut of Russell Crowe in the role of Bud White, and an auspicious debut it was.  Kevin Spacey is wonderful as cop-on-the-take Jack Vincennes, and when he drove up in his green '53 Studebaker Starliner coupe I said, \\"YES!!!  These guys know what they're doing!!!\\"  And they do.

B002GHHHM4|5.0|Watch this movie to see the master at work. The philosophy and physicality of Bruce Lee made this movie the standard for all to follow in Kung Fu cinema. Enter the Dragon is a superb legacy of Bruce Lee's spirit and achievement.
B0073PZIYI|2.0|I got sucked in to this cartoon because I saw good ratings on another board and the story sounds intriguing. Little did I know the ratings must have been done by teenagers. If you're a thinking person or older forget this movie. There is no thinking logic, no semblance of this science fiction ever becoming remotely possible, and no reasoning in the movie concept.

They create the metal mood, the metal sound and the metal lyrics...The title track is a complete classic...The Wizard is a great cool rocker...Behind the Wall of sleep got genious lyrics...NIB is another classic...EVIL WOMAN, WICKED WORLD....WOW! What can i say? If you don´t know the SABBATH sound and have a little curiosity to hear where METALLICA, IRON MAIDEN and SLAYER learn the metal art you gotta listen to BLACK SABBATH!!!!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I was looking for a random movie to watch and stumbled upon this. I didn't read the description, and for the first 5 minutes expected it to be a horror film stereotyping rednecks/hill-billies. But was i in for a treat... this was one of the most entertaining movies i have seen in a long time. I had always wondered if the plot lines for horror movies could be backed by a explanation based on accidental occurrences... turns out it can :)<br />You could easily take out scenes from the movie and construct a horror movie (for instance the bees scene) ... i am still laughing when i remember the scenes...

030788743X|4.0|You can read the plot lines elsewhere, so I won't repeat them here.  I am a Luddite who was a young mom in the 80s.  My experience with gaming was minimal.  (I did play the first video game ever at a Star Trek convention).<br /><br />So, my geeky nerd level was minimal.<br /><br />That said-I really liked the book.  I had a little trouble getting into the book at first, but the novel was so...novel.  What an interesting world the author created!  I can easily see our own world evolving into this one...where virtual reality is more 'real.'<br /><br />I've heard it will be made into a movie.  I don't know if that is true, but this story screams for visuals!  It might be the one time that the movie is better than the book.  Can't wait.<br />Although, the virtual reality schools sounded great.  The computer prevents bullying,  no one is teased based on appearances.  Teachers have lots of help by the computers in teaching.  Sounds like a very enriching home schooling experience with none of the flaws.<br /><br />So, non-geek women without much 80s experience can still enjoy a well-written novel.  (I think the movie will be better than the book, tho.  This story screams for visuals.  And yes, it is being made into a movie).<br /><br />Hope this helps.

0879309210|5.0|I was looking for something more serious than the typical \\"how to change your strings\\" book designed for players.<br /><br />This one is a must. I do all my own set-ups and adjustments and this book covers all the bases, even beyond what you might feel doing yourself, such a re-setting a neck. Never condescending and very clearly written.<br /><br />If there is something that you won't feel comfortable doing yourself, at least you will have a good appreciation of the skill level required for a pro to do the job.
B000002KFJ|5.0|SABOTAGE is the last fantastic SABBATH album with OZZY on the vocals...The 2 first songs are some of the heaviest songs in the SABBATH catalogue...MEGALOMANIA is a insane trip through madness...After SABOTAGE, things change a lot but the first 6 BLACK SABBATH albuns with the great OZZY are heavy metal gems with many heavy songs!

B005FQ2H8W|2.0|I remember watching this on tv and loved the story. I recorded it on VHS during that time. Now I want to buy it on DVD. But I can't because it is not captioned or subtitled for the deaf. So what is the point of buying it? There is ADA law that now says all movies should be captioned or subtitled. I still see a lack of respect of not doing that on many films or tv shows regardless of what year it was made. Pls made this movie captioned and all other movies and tv shows captioned from now now. Thanks!!
B000000OSE|5.0|Both USE YOUR ILLUSION are great collections of heavy rock songs by GUNS N´ ROSES!!!

I really like GUNS, but they really end after USE YOUR ILLUSION...

The Sabbath's debut is fantastic...It's just a PERFECT HEAVY ROCK METAL ALBUM!!!...But PARANOID got the same high level, maybe got more classic songs...WAR PIGS, the title track and IRON MAN are some of the most recognized songs of the world!!! PLANET CARAVAN is beautiful...ELETRIC FUNERAL is a raw sludge metal precursor...HAND OF DOOM is another heavy one...RAT SALAD is a nice instrumental and the great FAIRIES WEAR BOOTS close the album...If you like rock music you should listen to this Masterpiece!

0399159029|4.0|Having read and enjoyed Kerr's Berlin Noir Trilogy featuring Bernie Gunther, I was looking forward to reading Prague Fatale. Having now completed it, I consider Prague Fatale to be my favorite of the four books in this series that I've read.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the Bernie Gunther series you know, and if you aren't you'll find out, that Bernie Gunther is a tough-talking, hard drinking, chain-smoking character in the tradition of Raymond Chandler, Philip Marlowe and Same Spade. In Prague Fatale, Gunther, is once again an inspector in Berlin's Kripo, an organization he hates, and works for SS Reichprotector Reinhard Heydrich, a man he both despises and fears. The plot centers around Gunther being ordered by Heydrich to leave Berlin and come to Prague to serve as his personal bodyguard and detective. Heydrich believes that some member(s) of his senior staff is plotting to have him assassinated, and has brought Gunther in to investigate. Instead, it is one of Heydrich's adjutants who is murdered, and Gunther must \\"weave his special magic\\" to determine who the killer is.<br /><br />What makes Prague Fatale a few notches above the average mystery is Kerr's ability to not only tell a very interesting (though at times slow moving) story with well-researched and developed characterizations, but to his ability to create such a rich sense of time and place that I felt I was right there in the thick of things experiencing life in these times.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a mystery that involves slow-building tension and attention to detail as the main character unravels all of the layers needed to solve the crime, than Prague Fatale is one you should strongly consider. Bernie Gunther is a character you won't easily forget.
B000000P17|5.0|I really like this cover album SPAGHETTI INCIDENT, and it´s the real real real last breath of the great GUNS N´ ROSES!!! I mean, IZZY was the best songwriter of GUNS and already had left... Without Duff and Slash, it´s not a band anymore... It´s more like a AXL solo career... If you like GUNS, i don´t know why dislike SPAGHETTI... I t´s raw punk songs from good bands...Raw rock!!!
B0071T3Q9K|5.0|LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM PUTS A SMILE ON MY FACE:<br /><br />This review is a copy of a reply to a comment I made to another comment within another review. The comment I responded to was to someone criticising and questioning why McCartney would make such an album and used the \\"relatively\\" commercially UNsuccessful Ringo Starr album [[ASIN:B000007MVU Sentimental Journey]] as a comparison.<br /><br />I don't think one can make a fair comparison of any singer/musician performing covers of \\"oldies\\" unless the songs they've recorded are the same.<br /><br />From my own personal opinion about this album I initially found myself asking why did Paul do this. I'm 57 years old and have followed all the Beatles closely from the very beginning of their American launch on the Ed Sullivan Show. Like many of you who are reading this I am and always will be a \\"Beatle Maniac\\". We all, or at least should, know that McCartney and Lennon wrote 90+ percent of the Beatles Music and if one examines the songs that Paul primarily wrote as opposed to the ones that John penned, and also examines all the four Beatles separate careers and public personas I think one would deduce that Paul was/is the most sentimental of the Beatles WITH RESPECT TO HIS SONGWRITING. I am in no way suggesting that he was \\"deeper\\" than Lennon, Harrison, or Ringo; quite the contrary in fact. I think every one of them were and are incredibly complex and sensitive people and musicians and the legacy of all of their music they've left for us is a testament to that. The vast percentage of Ballads and love type songs the Beatles recorded though were written by Paul.<br /><br />What we have here I think is simply a 70 year old man who's had a most incredible life and, as with many of us as we age we reflect on much of our lives and certainly our childhood. McCartney has very naturally done that and he is in the enviable position of being able to record an album of songs that meant something to him personally from his childhood. Some people write memoirs, some sing and/or compose music and songs to  express and expose their lives. I don't think he cares if this album is a commercial success or not. Nor do I think he's one bit concerned about the reviews it will get. Let's face it, this man simply loves music and he loves playing and singing. If he didn't, he would have quit decades ago. If anyone has seen him perform live over the past ten years then you've walked away realizing you've seen an artist who just loves what he does.<br /><br />I don't think this album is about whether or not Paul sings these songs well or not. To me, it's something that gives me additional insight into why and how this man wrote beautiful songs such as Yesterday and Michelle to just note the very tip of the iceberg of Paul's incredible opus.<br /><br />Musician's like Paul McCartney are incredibly rare, having had a successful career spanning literally FIFTY YEARS, and are a gift to all of us who, as fans, have watched his career and public life evolve and in many cases affect our own lives on very deep levels. I don't think this album, and certainly not Paul himself, should receive any negative criticism whatsoever and I think that those who do critique it are missing the point and more importantly the whole picture. If you're not interested in listening to this music you don't have to buy it and if you've bought it you don't have to listen to it. But please, before criticizing any recording this man puts out at this stage of his life, think long and hard about the bigger picture (i.e., what this man has given to us) and at the very least, don't try to compare him to ANY other singer; former Beatle or otherwise.<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that whatever Paul chooses to do musically is, and has been for a very long time, a labor of love. It's not about money or commercial success to him; of that I am highly confident. Whether or not these are the \\"greatest\\" recordings of these individual songs ornot is not the point. Indeed, I should think that Paul himself would tell you they're not. They're songs that he loves and clearly, he's shown us he loves to sing. I think that's really all there is to this and intensely critiquing this effort is just wrong.<br /><br />On November 8, 1975 I saw the legendary pianist Arthur Rubinstein perform two concertos with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of Zubin Mehta. Afterward, he played six or seven solo encores. Not only is it unheard of to attend a concert and hear TWO piano concertos in one evening by the same pianist but at the time this took place Maestro Rubinstein was EIGHTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD. As is the case with any concert, classical or otherwise, there will be all kinds of people in the audience. Some of those people will be familiar with the music being performed, others will not, and a few will know it so well and have such well-trained ears, that they'll be able to pick out every missed or dropped note or mistake. Now Rubinstein dropped some notes here and there but I don't think anybody cared. That this man, who had been playing piano for people for seventy-five years or so was not criticized for his dropped notes or mistakes, nor should he have been. What Rubinstein gave to the world of music and to those who followed his career and life was nothing short of a blessing. To criticize him for doing something that less than 0.25% of the world population could come close to doing would simply be wrong.<br /><br />Although McCartney's not a classical musician, I think the analogy is still a fair one to make. Paul's given us too much for too long; he has nothing to prove. The man is seventy years old and I think that at this point nothing even remotely negative should be said about what he records. Negative words and thoughts about his music or singing are best kept as thoughts. They ad nothing of value to anyone to be written in public reviews. There are very few entertainers in this world who by virtue of their tremendously great careers, simply shouldn't be criticized negatively; unless of course they turn out to be serial killers or something. IMHO Paul McCartney falls into that category. Don't like the music, don't buy or listen to it but regardless, before you consider yourself worthy of criticizing Paul's artistic output at this stage of his career and life I suggest you first compare your own life to his before you knock him.<br /><br />I'm listening to the album right now and each and every song puts a smile on my face. I can tell, he had the time of his life producing this and the musicians accompanying him are superb!not is not the point. Indeed, I should think that Paul himself would tell you they're not.

B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|With the great IAN GILLAN at the vocals, SABBATH create another metal monster! It´s really like a mix from DEEP PURPLE classic vocals with the heavy metal SABBATH tunes...And i gotta say it´s sad they only recorded BORN AGAIN...There´s some gems here like the insane DISTURBING THE PRIEST, ZERO THE HERO and the fast THRASHED! I really like GILLAN vocals and i love SABBATH, so this is a diamond rock for me! MAYBE THE REAL LAST SABBATH ALBUM!!!

B004EPZ084|3.0|In \\"Horrible Bosses\\" three average guys Nick (Jason Bateman), Dale (Charlie Day) and Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) concoct a plan to avenge themselves on their \\"horrible bosses.\\" Actually, what they are thinking of not just revenge; it's murdering them, but of course, things will not go as they planned. The idea is great on paper, but not in practice, just like the movie itself, of which story starts out with an intriguing premise, but soon becomes a muddled mess with clichéd set-pieces.<br /><br />The three guys, flawed but likable, are played effectively by three actors. The jokes are often funny if predictable or familiar, and there is a credible sense of camaraderie between them. Unfortunately director Seth Gordon doesn't seem to know what to do with these characters in the storyline that could be darker, more absurd or ... anyway, it could have been something with originality.<br /><br />The \\"horrible bosses\\" are played by Kevin Spacey, Jennifer Aniston and Colin Farrell. (Farrell's role is comparatively small.) They are truly \\"horrible\\" in a totally different way, but there is one thing in common in three of them (not characters). They are all gifted actors, but none of them is known for comedic skills (by comedic here I mean \\"farce\\") on big screen.<br /><br />Despite the film's swearing and dirty words as well as its interesting setting that remind us of Danny DeVito when he was funny, \\"Horrible Bosses\\" remain in the safe territory, heavily relying on the shticks of the three leads.

B0071BY1T2|3.0|a mixed bag, best for committed fans<br /><br />A mixed bag. Sound for first 5 or so tracks very poor. The bass and rhythm guys might be good, I wouldn't know on the evidence! The concert gets more enjoyable after about track 6, when they take out the acoustic guitars for intro. to one track, that gets some kind of sense of dynamics about the music, instead of the fast and furious hell for leather approach up to then. Then there is a blues tinged track that allows Mike Kenneally to finally show that he is a serious musician too! The \\"send and return\\" interplay between Satch and Kenneally is a bit hackneyed (and is better done by Steve Morse and Jon Lord or Don Airey from Deep Purple). However, the interplay between Kenneally and Campitelli on keys and drums when they play off each other is superb, not to be missed. Satriani himself is a very tasty player, but doesn't engage with the audience much (at all?) and is a bit too technical and virtuoso, no need to run at 100 all the time Joe!<br /><br />The 3D distracts rather than enhances. Every so often you get a forest of smart phones in a long shot of the stage, which is more annoying than realistic. Scale is the issue, there is little point in trying to persuade an audience in the cinema that they are at a concert, the perspectives are wrong; it just don't work! I would rather see Joe Satriani with other guitar players, as in the G3 tours with Steve Vai and, in particular, Eric Johnson. In this kind of context he shines, as a player and as a bandmaster, because he understands contrast and gives everyone space. He didn't do enough of that on this gig.

B000FC12SM|5.0|I was recommended by a friend to read this book. My boyfriend and I have been together for a few years, and other than a few small problems, we're a solid couple. This book helped me see his side of things and visa versa. The best part of this book, it wasn't just a \\"female read\\", it was educational and tolerable enough for him to read it with me. It was our counselor without the cost!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I'm an avid reader of contemporary fantasy and have been for a few years now, but have only recently been compelled to start writing reviews.  The quality of the writing in this book alone warranted me taking the time to do one up.  I'm not really sure how best to approach this because, in fairness, this book is a little different from what I would normally choose to read.  That's really a compliment to the author, because I typically find myself reading things with a lot of action (and yes, this book does have action, so nobody panic), and a little faster pace (no, it's not sluggish or painful, so again, nobody panic).  What I was surprised by, most pleasantly, was the beauty and ease of the writing style.  The prose was really quite astonishing in parts, and I found myself reading sections over again -- not because I didn't follow the content, but because it was just delightful to read.<br />The story -- and there is a LOT of story in this novel -- was immensely detailed and well thought out.  There were a couple points where I almost got bogged down in them, but with a quick change in direction of the scene, I was back into the story and allowed the time necessary to digest and organize what I'd just learned.  I found her use of paganism refreshing, and from what I could discern, historically sound.  I enjoyed the banter between the two main characters, and watching their relationship unfold.  Their conflicted emotions about their situation ALMOST pushed the point of being mildly annoying to me, but just at that breaking point, the author gave this reader what she'd hope to see with some clear definition and direction.<br />The end is a huge culmination of everything you learn throughout the novel, and though it comes on fast, it's not rushed or frantic. The author clearly starts to weave in the plot for where the story heads next, but a definite end to the story at hand.<br />I truly enjoyed this book on the whole, and would give it an enthusiastic 4.5 stars...if Amazon would let me :)  I want to leave a little room so that I can rate the next one even higher, especially if the author continues to improve with every novel, making the highs even higher and the lows even lower.  I don't doubt that she can!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I am not much of a Bruce fan,but this new cd is wonderful.

If you never listened or bought Bruce,please try this one!

B004ZNANZA|4.0|Welcome To The Great Wall Of Floyd! We all have a copy of this album in some form. So we are buying this because of the remastered sound & bonus tracks.Now i have bought all 3 Experience Versions Dsotm & Wywh & this. On to the sound it's a very smooth sound but for a new remaster i'm suprised that the volume is not more up front and loud. It is a great smooth mix of the drums and vocals and can handle all the volume you can give to it like on the other two Experience Versions. The bonus tracks are cool to some degree. It's cool to hear what they had to go through to get the finishing results. Some are like unmixed full songs and some are just bits and pieces of just keyboards and Roger Waters just screaming away in the mic. Half of the demos are kinda cool the other half not so much. They also had this listed as 4 cd's and it was only 3 cd's but whatever as long as all the music i paid for is on there i dont care. The repackaging is nice and lots of shiny detail & artwork.This is a very good new version with some extra stuff to hear.The only thing i think it is missing on here is WHEN THE TIGERS BROKE FREE & OUR BACKS TO THE WALL. They did put a demo version of OUR BACKS TO THE WALL but not a good one.If those two songs where on here i would be giving this 5 stars but since they didn't put it on here i'm going with 4 stars.

0439023513|2.0|The first two books were so good but the third was so disappointing.  I feel like I wasted my time and the trilogy seems to incomplete.  I think the third book was so rushed when written, there are parts that jump around or important people are killed off with little explanation or in an unrealistic way.  Katniss seemed so strong in the first two books but in this one she was nothing more than a selfish whiner.  All I wanted was to get to the end so I'd know what happened at the end of all of this ... and even that was a disappointment.
B005PTYP70|5.0|Great Entertainment at a very attractive price!!! Enjoyed it immensely.<br />Great prep for MI4, Ghost Protocal.  Fun to watch again and again whenever the urge arises.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought this book at the behest of my 13 year old son. I figured I would read it to give us something more to talk about and share. I started reading the book during a television commercial and 3 hours later I put it down after reading the whole thing. I thought that the characters were so real and the story just draws you in. I really enjoyed this book and I will continue by reading the rest of the trilogy. I also can't wait to talk about this story with my son and go see the movie upon release and compare it to it's source material. Any excellent read and one I would highly recommend.

1451683405|5.0|It was a Reformed theologian who disabused me of the concept of free will several years ago, and I've found it a fascinating topic ever since.  Sam Harris has produced a brief monograph on the issue that manages to distill the key issues without creating an impenetrable density for the reader to slog through.<br /><br />For those who think value is found in a dollars-to-words ratio, the thinness and focus of this volume might not seem like a bargain, but I loved having a book with something important to say that I actually READ.  I'm not saying that all subject matter must be reduced to tweets, but I know that, for example, as fascinated as I am by the topic of moral improvement that Stephen Pinker covers in [[ASIN:0670022950 The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined]], I am never going to read more than 600 pages just on that subject.  There are simply too many other things I also care about.  So Harris has done people like me a real favor by thinking about free will and pulling together the relevant evidence for his position, and expressing his ideas with his trademark wit and clarity in a work that can be digested in an hour or less.<br /><br />For those who read about free will in other books and publications, there's nothing very new here.  In fact, given the choice between recommending this book and something else, depending on the person I was talking with, I might instead suggest Cris Evatt's [[ASIN:0970818181 The Myth of Free Will, Revised & Expanded Edition]].  Cris has no credentials and the book is a collection of essays and quotes from various sources rather than a single, cohesive argument, but it makes one of the strongest cumulative cases for determinism in a short work that I've seen.<br /><br />The one thing that did surprise me is the positive blurb on the book jacket from Owen Flanagan, whose [[ASIN:0465024610 The Problem Of The Soul: Two Visions Of Mind And How To Reconcile Them]] is a stunning case for compatabilism, whereas Harris writes, \\"Compatabilists have produced a vast literature in an effort to finesse [moral complications from determinism].  More than in any other area of academic philosophy, the result resembles theology.  (I suspect this is not an accident.  The effort has been primarily one of not allowing the laws of nature to strip us of a cherished illusion.)\\"  And again: \\"Compatibilism amounts to nothing more than an assertion of the following creed: A puppet is free as long as he loves his strings.\\"  What Harris (convincingly, in my view) makes a case for is quite different from the case that Flanagan makes, so I think it is to Flanagan's credit that he nevertheless endorses Harris's work.<br /><br />Daniel Dennett comes in for some well-deserved (but well-modulated) criticism in \\"Free Will\\" for the sort of epistemological shell-game he employs in an effort to rescue some \\"elbow room\\" for a brand of free will.  I noted earlier that it was the argument of a theologian friend that made me realize that free will is impossible, but that's not quite complete.  It was that argument in addition to the utter failure of Dennett's [[ASIN:0142003840 Freedom Evolves]] to convince me that anything like a free will worth having could possible exist that drained the last corpuscle of my delusion from my mind.  There's nothing like a failed argument, by friend or foe, to make you consider the plausible correctness of the opposite position.  The weaknesses I discerned in Dennett's case are precisely the ones Harris goes after, and in brief, intelligent prose dispatches them with an effectiveness and efficiency few authors could manage.<br /><br />Harris states that the existence of an immaterial soul does nothing to rescue the notion of libertarian free will.  This is certainly correct, although I have heard the argument made many times as a trope that \\"free will is not possible if humans don't have a spirit or soul.\\"  Because the issue is causality in general and not merely physical causality, whether a cause is purely physical, like a cue ball hitting an eight ball (or an electron firing in a neuron), or can be thought of in immaterial terms, like an idea inspiring a poem, makes no difference.  Everything, physical or otherwise, is either the result of prior conditions, or if not, is random.  Souls change none of that.<br /><br />So theists who try to argue that without a god, humans have no free will are wrong.  That simply doesn't matter.  And perhaps the most disturbing implication of some points in Harris's argument is that if a god did exist, in all likelihood it wouldn't have libertarian free will, either.  If you struggled with some of the absurdities inherent in our existence before, a deep appreciation of our condition vis-a-vis determinism will push you so far down the rabbit hole you might just find yourself reading much longer, more profound, denser works in some effort to get your bearings.  And in the end it is probable that the best you'll be able to muster is simple agreement with what Harris says in this slim volume.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Just drove to the store, picked up the CD and heard the whole thing... I have to say this is his best one since The Rising. It's beautifully layered and textured with a big, rich, full sound. His lyrics are traditional Bruce... honest and powerful. He blends that old sound with a modern flair - but it works.... it so works.  His last couple albums were good, but not great...  This one is beyond great...  It's amazing!  I'm trying to think of a particular song that stands out, but honestly every song here stands on its own. This isn't just hyperbole cause its a new album....  This is the real deal.  Well done, Bruce! Can't wait to listen over and over and make these songs my own!

B004S49Z3W|3.0|I don't read a lot of chick lit so this was a bit hard to get into, especially due to my constant \\"wait, that didn't happen in the movie\\" moments! All that aside, enjoyable read, the movie won't spoil it as the two are quite different... Sadly I really did prefer the film here, thought the actors brought a lot to their roles, but it was very interesting to see where it originated. If you're a fan of the film, I say check it out, fun read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this has a clean interface, all the basic features plus a few neat extras. I was surprised too see you can watch a replay on how to beat the various winning hand deals.  overall its a great game. if it wasn't for the very minor and non-invasive ads I'd give it 5 stars.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really enjoy this app. It is very efficiant because you don't need wi-fi... unlike many other apps. Very fun and challenging to your mind. Some levels are much easier than others, but I highly reccomend this to friends. It is a nice app for Kindle Fires.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|don't get this app. the controls are terrible. the highest my score ever gets is ten. that's all. good thing this was free.
B004FOA84A|3.0|It was okay but it seriously could be a bit longer and they should have added some extra puzzles to make it more challenging and fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is really good because it has a lot of games on it. They are pretty much all the same but other than that it is good.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I have played it on an ipod and a kindle fire and this was my first game on my kindle fire you will love it!
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This is a ok product. It probably should be 3 1/2 stars though. My biggest complaint is about the difficulty I had with installing the new LED bulb. The 2 metal contacts seem to be slightly larger diameter than the original bulb. I had a hard time pushing it in. I tried turning it 180 degrees but it still would not go in easy. If you aren't careful, you will bend the contact wires. I eventually got it to go in and it worked like it should. I purchased it to extend the battery life in my old Mini Maglite. For that, it does the job without much expense. Some other reviews have complained about the tail switch. It does wobble a bit, which makes it seem cheap. It Is WATER RESISTANT though. I removed the batteries, put the tail switch back on and dropped the light in a bucket of water for 30 seconds. I then took the light apart and found NO water inside. That should be an answer for others who question that without testing it. This is certainly a brighter light than with the original bulb. It has a different light spectrum for sure, a harsh light, devoid of any nice color.<br />If you really want a nice, bright AA LED, spend the extra money and buy the latest generation, 77 Lumens, AA Mini Maglite as well as the upgrade for your old light. The new AA mini Mag has a Cree XPE #106 bulb in it. I compared it side by side with a TerraLUX Lightstar 220. That's right, 220 Lumens. I aimed each light on a 30 ft.tree top that was approximately 100 ft. away. They both lit up the tree top, but the new Mini Mag really defined the branches well, the TerraLUX did not. My old Mini Mag with the LED replacement bulb, lit up the tree top very dimly at best. It's better for close range. I'm not sorry that I purchased it. I put it in a place I can find it case of a power outage. By the way, I dropped it while standing on a 10 ft. step ladder and it still works, try that with an old bulb Mini.  Bluwolf
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game I love it and it is a great time killer. If you like sliceing fruit then you should get this game you won't regret it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Using on Kindle Fire.  Awesome!  Has worked flawlessly.  A couple of other reviews say ads pop up constantly.  That's not been my experience at all -- one ad in between each game -- not a bad price to pay for a free app.
B0071PS7AC|4.0|Your first throws will feel wonky but after a few games you'll feel the control. Imagine a pinball plunger you can steer and you'll get it. I'm starting to like this game.
1451683405|5.0|Sam Harris has done it again.  The concept of free-will has been dealt a death blow and is now lying on the floor in a heap surrounded by a chalk outline.  But don't blame Sam for this.....he had no choice.  All we have to do is introspect well enough to see that free-will is nowhere to be found.<br /><br />  I thought it was just me when I couldn't understand what Dennett was getting at in Freedom Evolves.  It's liberating to know that some intuition pumps (i.e. free-will) just can't get a foothold in our shared reality no matter how big or small we make ourselves.  We no longer have to make excuses for it and pay homage to this confusing term with roots in folk psychology.<br />Let's collectively say goodbye to free-will and get on with the business of compassion, morality and moral responsibility without having to pay lipservice to this dead metaphor.

B004W89N72|5.0|All I require is a good, independent note style calendar and this suits me perfectly.  It's simple and easy to use.  I have plenty of room to add notes for a given day and can even color code them to keep work and personal stuff separate.  The app works great and I must say, I love the paper texture as the background.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I love tpu cases, but i could never find one good enough for my iphone. I had one really good tpu case that i got for $5 from amazon, but no tpu case i've ever received offers enough protection around the screen. Then, i came across this product that also came with a screen protector. I thought why not give this tpu a shot and if it isn't what im looking for then i will stop trying to get a good tpu case and stick with my hybrid case. When I received this case, I was more then surprised by it's sturdiness. It snaps right on the iphone firmly, and the screen protector took 5 seconds to put on and its perfect with no bubbles. The case offers a nice lip around the front of the screen so if i dropped the phone i'm guessing the lip with absorb the impact versus the glass hitting a surface. Also, the design on the back is a lot nicer in person on your phone then it looks online, the swirls are actually inside the case for design and also absorb impact if you drop your phone which a nice touch. I don't know the durability of this case though, but I feel like it will do a fine job considering how sturdy it is. I have many different iphone cases; incipio, otterbox commuter, speck pixelskin, and 2 tpu cases that are nice but dont offer front protection, and this case is my favorite out of all of these cases and I will be sticking with this case for a while if it protects my iphone hopefully. Very nice case though, I recommend this amazon product to anyone it's very high quality.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This review is for the films only, since the Blu rays aren't out yet.<br /><br />IMO, these are probably THE best action/adventure movies of all time.<br />Very entertaining although<br />I was shocked at the storyline of the Crystal skull.<br />ALIENS, George? Really?...REALLY?!!<br /><br />I'm just glad that these films are not the sole property of Lucas.<br />(otherwise I can see -in Raiders- when the army truck with Marion 'inside' blows up, we'd hear Indy shriek \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\")<br /><br />I'm looking forward to these on Blu-Ray, though why they took so long to be released is anyone's guess.<br />THESE movies are what Blu-Ray was created for!
B005K17RU0|5.0|A wonderful app for the frequent traveler.  I keep a list of about ten cities and I have quick access to accurate and detailed weather info.
0439023513|3.0|I was enthralled with the first book.  Excited by the second book.  Mind-numbingly bored with the third.  I found myself barely reading it after a while... I just kept skimming through the pages, stopping once and a while for an important conversation, and then skipping forward some more.  It's not a bad book, and I can even get over all the deaths, and I don't even mind the ending, but the way the story unfolded was dull and far too long.  It dragged on and on until I had no interest in it.<br /><br />Katniss suffers from an overabundance of chaotic and redundant thinking, constantly debating how numb and destructive her entire life/world/existence is - It just doesn't have the same \\"spark\\" as the first book.  I feel most of the plot was simply \\"filler\\" to lead the reader on a wild goose chase before finally getting to the end of the story.  There really was no story, other than \\"Who will she end up with?\\" The side stories did little to distract the reader from the desperate need of the main character to get to that romantic resolution, and little attention was paid to developing the self awareness/esteem of the main character.  As some people have suggested, the third book may have had greater potential if it had been told from Haymitch's point of view, instead of Katniss'.<br /><br />I think the other problem is that authors often have this insane notion that senseless deaths add to the weight of the story, but sometimes, they are just a lead weight that sink the story.  I felt as numb as Katniss in the third book, and that was about it.  Just numb.  And perhaps that's because that is all I really felt the story had to offer by the end.  The ending didn't have enough warmth to snap me out of that numb feeling.  It's worth the read, but I feel this last book was forced and manufactured without proper editing.  Perhaps we can beg for a \\"redo\\" in the movie version.

1118156315|5.0|As an entrepreneur and education professional, i was always looking for innovative ways of doing business. It was important for my company and more important to my students, because our mission was always bring the best business material we can. There were a lot of content on traditional business books, business magazines and internet but yet we were still having trouble finding a uniform and simple logic to explain and understand how business work. So we find the work of Osterwalder and Pigneur in the book Business Model Generation. It changed the game with the approach of Business Models and all the revolutionary visual, simple and uniform methods.<br /><br />But despite of this there were one important piece missing : the mind of people. Companies and organizations are structured arrangements of people working towards a common goal. Its imperative they understand itselves, their mission, their skills, interests, abilities, goals and how they can contribute to a better company, to a better job, to a better life. With the same visual, logic, easy-to-use approach of Business Models, Tim Clark created a powerful tool to understand all of this. This book is a guide, a person guide that can have a deep impact to carreers, people managers and companies.<br /><br />Thank you Tim for the wonderful contribution. I'm proud to be one small part of it!<br /><br />Cassiano Farani - Co-creator - Business Model You - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.<br />cassiano@corebusiness.net.br

B004I8WD6E|4.0|The Amazon Basics case is one of the best cases I've gotten for my iPhone. It shields my iPhone nicely and is a great deal. Most wires plug into the iPhone easily and I have not too many problems docking my iPhone. The design is very nice and it complements the iPhone instead of just covering it. A problem I do have with the case is that over time it is starting to get yellow and that sometimes are are problems plugging in cables. Other than that the case is great.<br /><br />The screen protector was easy to install and to me is much better than the invisibleshield and other alternatives. The invisibleshield started to scratch after a while but the AmazonBasics screen protector has done a great job and does not have the orange peel feeling.<br /><br />The AmazonBasics case and screen protector are a great value and is absolutely worth the price. If you are looking for a great case and screen protector buy this!
0307463745|5.0|Much of ReWork is memorialised common sense - but that kind of common sense that gets glossed over every hour of every day in every organisation in the world.<br /><br />It is written in a brutally economical style, consistent with its underlying message: everything is overcomplicated: simplify, simplify, simplify. It is also a manifesto for those who want to start their own business. For those who dream fitfully of pulling the rip cord on the corporate treadmill - and let's face it: in these miserable times, we are many - this might be just the firm push between the shoulderblades we need.<br /><br />Rework is funny, too, and it contains many quotable quotes. My favourite: \\"Policies are organisation scar tissue. They are codified over-reactions to situations that are unlikely to happen again\\".<br /><br />Beautiful: and so true. (I should know: I work in the legal department!)<br /><br />You'll be through it in a day, but you'll read it again.<br /><br />Excellent stuff.<br /><br />Olly Buxton

B002BWP49C|3.0|I remember when they were thinking about making this book into one or two movies, and at first I thought it really should be two movies and was glad they decided to split it.  Now after seeing it, I've changed my mind.<br />This movie really should have been the first 35 or 40 minutes of one movie, and not a movie in itself.  If you're a fan, you will probably enjoy the movie on some level, but it falls short.<br />It didn't seem like a movie to me.  It seemed more like an episode of a weekly television drama.  This week on a very special Twilight: Edward and Bella get married.  It wasn't until the last ten or fifteen minutes that it even felt like a movie.<br />Also, every movie so far has had one scene with a great song that stands out.  In the first movie, it was the baseball scene to Supermassive Black Hole.  In New Moon it was chasing Victoria to Hearing Damage.  In Eclipse, it was the preparing to fight scene to Unkle's With You in My Head.  This movie didn't have a stand-out scene, and that was kind of disappointing.<br />What I liked... the music.  When they brought back Flightless Bird from the prom, during their wedding dance, I almost cried!  Great job.  Also, they renewed Bella's lullaby which I don't recall hearing since the first movie, and that was really reminiscent of the first movie that captured their romance so well.<br />I also loved how they handled Bella's transformation.  The scenes of her life flashing by before her last heartbeat was very nicely done.  Also, Jacob's imprinting was handled extremely well, IMHO.  But again, these great parts were all crammed into the last ten minutes of the movie.<br />What I didn't like.  In this movie, the Cullens all look just awful.  Even Alice, and you've got to try pretty hard to make Alice look unattractive.  Catherine Hardwicke managed it for a few seconds in the first movie - in the post-baseball/garage scene, but aside from that, no other director has made Alice or the Cullens so unattractive.  Wasthis done on purpose so Bella will look better by comparison?<br />The Wolves:  I thought I was watching a Disney movie when the wolf pack had their pow-wow.  It really makes me appreciate the realness of the wolves in New Moon and Eclipse.<br />Also, the director does the commentary on this dvd, which is something that I always look forward to, to hear about how certain scenes were made and movie secrets, etc.  During commentary, he often said, \\"There's a lot to talk about in this scene,\\" but then didn't say much about it.  He gushes about how wonderful every single person he worked with was, which is fine, but after a while, I started to wonder if he was getting kickbacks for every compliment.<br />I actually thought this was Kristin Stewart's best performance yet.  She smiles more in this movie than in all others put together and she has more expressions.  Maybe I'm just getting used to her.<br />I'm giving the movie two stars and one extra for the music.  Seeing this movie made me appreciate Eclipse, which was my least favorite of the series until this came out.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Perhaps it is simply the book I needed at the time I read it but I can't say how much I enjoyed this book. Loved it really and hated to be finished truth be told. I relish a good family/generation novel at most any time, but this one, following three women with their stories interwoven as they are was a fabulous read. Taking place simultaneously in 1900, 1975, and 2005 and jumping back in forth it seamlessly incorporated all three stoies each with the other. None got too far ahead before the others would enter to fill in the blanks. Well done! The 'mystery' aspect had me guessing till the end and no, I did not figure it out myself till nearly the end. I enjoyed the writers style, loved the insertion of the fairy tales and appreciated most it was something I could easily suggest to my granddaughter.....no foul language, no sex, but not at all prudish by the way. Just a teeny bit of 'sex' sans any detail and very necessary to the storyline. Simply a well told story with no gimmicks to color it up. I immediately went and bought Miss Mortons other two selections and look forward to begininng one this very afternoon. Hopefully it will likewise rob me of sleep for a few nights.

1612130283|5.0|This book could have been written about my life as seen through another's eyes, that is essentially without the man being a multi-millionaire who's into BDSM. Otherwise: the dominant aspects, his personal beauty and above all the feelings that he invokes within his partner are very close to my own history. I found a significant commonality between the characters and myself that I could relate to: a conflict between intimacy and control. In the end, he succumbs to feelings of love despite himself. A winner!!!

B007D5DUBG|5.0|I purchased this album through Amazon.com for under 4 bucks ($3.61) for 5 songs. And I have to say it was $4.00 well spent! There are two songs that are on the previous album \\"Light Me Up\\" but these versions are LIVE! I'm not usually one for live recordings, sometimes the crowd screaming gets in my way, but it was dimmed down in these recordings.<br /><br />There are three new songs, and they are fantastic! I've been a Pretty Reckless fan since I first heard Just Tonight, when I recieved the single as a free download on iTunes. These new songs do not disappoint. They are hard edges, guitar riffs and Taylor's voice at the forefront.  This is Rock n' Roll!<br /><br />I have to take a moment to talk about Taylor Momsens voice. I'm a voice girl, I love or hate voices and in this case I love! I just don't understand how someone so young can put so much into their voice. If you didn't know who was singing, you would never guess that the person behind this soulful emotion filled voice was under 18 or maybe she is now just barely 18. Her voice sounds as though she has lived a 100 years and not all of them good.  She just gets it right, and you feel what she feels as she is singing. When she hits certain parts of songs, I'll even get chills on occasion.<br /><br />There are so many young starlets singing now days it becomes hard to distinguish between all the teeny bopper voices and cookie cutter songs, this is not the case with actress turned musician Taylor. This is one of the rare cases where I feel like an actor turned musician actually works. I think the only other instance I can think of where the actor turned musician makes you forget that they even acted is Jared Leto of 30 Seconds to Mars.

031617615X|5.0|I enjoyed this episode of the Twilight Saga which is now coming to an end. The wedding was beautiful and Bella was a very beautiful bride. The gown was simply gorgeous and well designed.  The honeymoon scenery was wonderful and well scripted. My favorite scenes were those of the birth of the baby. The acting was really good and the effort put into making Bella look frail and sick was great. Her transformation into her vampire body was fantastic.  I can't wait for the finale in November when Bella comes into her own as a vampire and true member of the Cullen family. The defeat of the Volturi Coven, is going to be great, I almost hate to seen it all come to an end!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Game has great graphics, and some say it has ads , I don't see the links to buy other great games from them as ads. I mean after all they do not come up during play only upon entering, so blahhhh, I got it as a free app of the day and I Love it thanks amazon:)
B004EPZ02A|4.0|Being a fan of the first two movies, I had high hopes for this one.  While I didn't find this to be the scariest of the bunch, it is still enjoyable.  Don't get me wrong though, it definitely has it's scary moments (bloody mary scene anyone?).  If you're like me, you thought you had a fairly good grasp of the story based on the first two films...this one just opens up a whole can of worms.  The ending is relatively confusing and leaves a lot of questions unanswered...which leads into the inevitable sequel.  Over all if you liked the first two, you'll probably like this one...and if you didn't like them then you'll probably hate it.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Sam Harris brings his characteristic combination of eloquence and approachability to this well-traveled discussion. Where other writers obscure themselves with philosophical jargon, Harris speaks plainly yet colorfully in a way that simply makes his position obvious.<br /><br />This text is especially forceful when combined with The Moral Landscape, which is a proposed approach to morality that does not hinge on the illusion of free will he so easily handles here.<br /><br />This is a \\"don't miss\\".
B0071PS7AC|1.0|Nothing fun about this game, bot will almost instantly catch up when behind and regardless of how similar two throws are, the pins are completely inconsistent.

B0071PS7AC|4.0|the title says it all...its a great game but there's no way to win...I played it like 10 times and every time the comp would win in the last frame...fix the difficulty and it would be a 5* app...no one wants to play a game that's impossible to beat...
B0071PS7AC|4.0|Don't know where these people get the poor handling from.  Just pull back and let it rip.  Tried the spin, not impressed by it but still won every game against the computer.  Better than some worse than others.  Would prefer using accel for control, hopefully with an update.  HINT HINT
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|i really enjoyed watching this movie. i saw it when i was a kid and loved it. micheal did a great job on this movie. i'm glad i could find this movie so i could bring that same joy of this movie to my own kids.

B003Y5H574|2.0|Crazy, Stupid, Love is good for two reasons: Julianne Moore and Emma Stone. There are the only two characters that have any emotional depth and realness. Everyone else is one-dimensional and transparent. This is probably Ryan Gosling's weakest performance, he just stands there looking sexy...he adds nothing and then suddenly his character does a 180 and all of a sudden he's a good guy instead of a player? Guys don't usually change their bad boy ways that quickly! Steve Carell wasn't very relatable as well. Marisa Tomei tries too hard to be outrageous, it just comes off as bad acting. And the whole 13 year-old boy who has an obsessive crush on his 17 year-old babysitter was just plain horrible! I wanted to like this movie but it wasn't funny or cute, or heck even romantic! Oh well...

But a nice little game to play.  forget about what the others are saying this is good stuff.  May be if they actually paid for it, they would like it more.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|I would not recommend this adapter unless you are OK with a noticeable reduction in signal quality. I was hoping to be able to use this as a permanent connection to my Xbox 360 and also allow for a quick connection to my laptop for dual screen when I wanted it. Unfortunately the picture clarity dropped off significantly when I ran my MS VGA cable through this adapter. I've discovered with several cables lately that when it comes to an analog signal, you're better off if you spend the money and get a quality cable the first time.<br /><br />I still gave it 3 stars, because it did look fine when I used my laptop for dual screen and I didn't notice any reduction there. It just doesn't deliver HD quality.<br /><br />**EDIT**<br /><br />After reading another review, I have discovered that the quality is a little better when you have both VGAs connected to this adapter and connected to another device at the other end. On other words, to use this adapter the way I want, I would have to constantly keep the extra VGA cable plugged into something in order to get a clear image through the primary VGA. I'm moving it up to four stars, but it would be five if it could deliver a clear signal through one of the lines without the other connected to something
0439023521|3.0|hunger games was the first book that I read of this kind.I liked the book and am not an author,but felt there could of been more details .I found myself skipping over some of the book.the plot of an overpopulated world children can provide for their families food,oil and for these provisions they have to put their name in a lottery to play in a game on t.v. where 2 kids from each district have to kill eachother off,last one standing.

B0052U59F4|1.0|The story hooked me at first, but it took a sick twist that led me to feel I was reading a very disturbing porn novel. I deleted it from my Kindle 25% of the way through. Sick and wrong. No woman should agree to what Grey was asking of Ana. No matter how \\"hot\\" he is.

B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard's rarely wrong but these are not old ideas, so much as they are timeless.  I only hate that I can't hear it again for the first time.
1400064287|4.0|Here's a confession. I read this book twice. Oh, I know what you're thinking. How sticky could it be, if I had to read it again? The answer is that it's not very. Nonetheless, the book is really worthwhile reading, and an excellent reference after you've read it, at least twice. Though presented in a easy, breezy fashion by the brothers Heath, the book's insights are really profound. For example, the more we know about a subject, the more we presume our listener knows. The Heaths call it the curse of knowledge. Honing your message so it frames an issue in a sticky way is hard work. This book won't necessarily give you a short cut to glory, but it will help you identify hazards. If you want people to get the message, do it with a  Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Emotional Story. Of course, it's an acronym. Always remember: make it sticky, or they'll forget it quickly.

0985081821|4.0|I was given this for review by the publisher.<br /><br />Well, this was a no-brainer for me. Urban paranormal romance, spirits, vampires, weres, witches and an innovative redefining of all of the above. Throw in the torments of the present and visions of a tragic past, mix in enduring love and heartbreaking loss, and great teeming bouts of emotion as a consequence and you pretty much know what it was like to read this book.<br /><br />It wasn't perfect (my main issue came with the relationship between Sophia and Charles - I don't want to spoilt it though, so I'll just say that I found it unbelievable, way too restrained and somewhat lacking, although the tiny morsels of 'heat' were deliciously tantalising. But it read like a YA book. Together over six months and through death defying experiences, yet still they feel unable to come together? It's a shame, because the rest was really enjoyable.<br /><br />I'd say the greater romance came midway through the book when the past is bought into the present for a few chapters. Again, I' don't wish to spoil it for you, so can't say why. Read it and find out :)<br /><br />Sophia was a realistic heroine. She wasn't the archetypal weakling, nor the kick ass Buffy re-hash, I do so tire of. Don't get me wrong, she was no doormat, but her fragility was clear and unashamed, largely. I would award this book 4/5. It was emotional, fun and I enjoyed every minute of the journey. I will follow this author and this series. Indeed, I look forward to the next exciting installment: Her Sweetest Downfall. Forever Girls Journals - Ophelia due for release sometime this year :)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00APXGKFQ Finding Esta: #1 The Supes Series (Urban Fantasy Paranormal & Mystery)]]fun and I enjoyed every minute of the journey.

1584282584|2.0|I must agree with Adriel's 2-star review. I'm very new to flash photography and need to give Niekerk the benefit of the doubt as he's clearly the experienced one... but here is my experience; I borrowed both this book and Bryan Peterson's flash photography book from the library at the same time.  I picked up this one first based on the incredibly positive reviews. Right off the bat I was annoyed by a few things; mostly redundancy in the text and continual references to things he \\"will not talk about in this book\\", very distracting. Note that those are gripes about the style of writing/teaching, not the author's personal gift of flash photography or knowledge thereof.  However, I found it really hard to stay tuned and the result is that I finally gave up and learned very little. On page 23 came the clincher; a mathmatical equation that just did not make sense. After trying to make sense of it, I handed the book to my husband who not only has a degree in education, but is very gifted at math.  He pored over that page for quite some time before giving up himself. That is when I picked up Peterson's book which I found to be straightforward, organized and non-repetetive. I'm already doing hands-on exercises with lighting only a few pages in. Finally; not that you can't get the point across with different styles of pictures, but Peterson's photographic examples are amazing next to Niekerks. Again, I'm open to the idea that I'm missing something with Niekerk, but that didn't keep this from being a very discouraging experience with \\"On-Camera Flash\\" and I would not recommend it to someone who needs a more straightforward teaching style.
1416550550|5.0|We got this book in our faculty book club for Christmas reading and I read it in 2 weeks.  It was so entertaining and emotional.  I love how she went between the three women to give the entire picture of what happened.  I loved the book so much that I went and bought The House at Riverton and The Distant Hours.  The way she wrote the story it was impossible not to become so wrapped up in the characters and really supporting Eliza.  I thought it was a great read and would recommend it to anyone!
B0052U59F4|1.0|I downloaded the book to my Kindle because it was on the best seller list and had 4 stars overall rating on Amazon. I wish I'd taken the time to read some of the reviews. As it turns out I agree with the negative.<br />I found myself thinking \\"Twilight, plus some spanking, minus the sparkly vampires.\\" Here, I'll save you all some time (SPOILER ALERT):<br /><br />Once upon a time...<br />I'm Ana. I'm clumsy and naive. I like books. I dig this guy. He couldn't possibly like me. He's rich. I wonder if he's gay?  His eyes are gray. Super gray. Intensely gray. Intense AND gray. Serious and gray. Super gray. Dark and gray. [insert 100+ other ways to say \\"gray eyes\\" here]<br />I blush. I gasp. He touches me \\"down there.\\" I gasp again. He gasps. We both gasp. I blush some more. I gasp some more. I refer to my genitals as \\"down there\\" a few more times. I blush some more. Sorry, I mean I \\"flush\\" some more. I bite my lip. He gasps a lot more. More gasping. More blushing/flushing. More lip biting. Still more gasping.<br />The end.<br /><br />The bad:<br />It was an interesting concept - for a romance novel. However the story is weak, the pace is slow and awkward, the characters come through as more schizophrenic than complicated, the \\"romance\\" is a juvenile and dysfunctional crush, and the \\"erotic\\" scenes alternate between Penthouse Forum and something that sounds like it was written by a painfully shy and sheltered 13 year old. I have now read through some of the rave reviews and I have to assume that these were posted by people easily shocked and/or titillated. I can't imagine what fans are comparing this to when they describe this as \\"good.\\"<br /><br />The good:<br />Nice cover art.
B0000C83YJ|4.0|Never thought about Boy George as a great singer, but I always saw him as I good performer. Despite the make up and the posing, this is a great pop album. A reference of my teenage years along with New Romantic bands coming out in those days

0385344228|2.0|At the start of this book, I thought it was going to be great. Other readers don't seem to like the courtroom  transcript method of dialogue, but having participated in several trials, I always enjoy it. Plot was pretty straight forward....student murdered, son of prosecutor is charged, prosecutor is removed from case. There are certain links between murdered student and prosecutors son. OK....pretty basic....quality of the read is in how it builds and plays out. This is where it does not shine. Other than the son, the characters are really not believable, especially the prosecutor himself, his father, and the other possible suspect, a convicted child sex offender. How it all plays out caused me to just say....nah, don't buy that. THe violence gene thing was kind of a yawn, and overspent.<br /><br />Overall, just OK.  Thought about maybe 3 stars, but just couldn't.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|Ok so I have been an avid league and tournament bowler for 12 years or so... First of all, the pin action is horrible. Not realistic in the slightest. But I continue to play and give the game a chance. The second frame, I bowl a gutter and then a spare. Yes it is a SPARE not a strike if bowled on the second ball of a frame, and should be scored accordingly. Then I got another spare and all it did was add 10 pins to my scores and call it a day. This app appears as if someone quite loosely explained the scoring of bowling to someone who had no idea what they were talking about and they tried to make an app from their less than solid knowledge of the sport. Uninstall!

B004A8ZWWO|2.0|Okay, you may say it is an Eddie Murphy movie.  Well, in the last decade he seem to go to family friendly movies and so I started to enjoy him.  I honestly don't know if he has done some of his traditional movies in the last 5 years because I don't follow many movies or actors.  The only Ben Stiller movies I have seen have been pretty clean too as far as language goes...maybe a word or two.  This movie was actually good to me except foul language KILLS a movie for me, especially the gd word. I think foul language is offensive and just sounds ugly.  I really thought this was going to be a cleaner movie.

1612130283|5.0|Okay, so I stayed up until 3AM reading this book so that I could finish it in one day; I found it very difficult to put down, and when I finally had a few hours to read it I couldn't tear myself away even for sleep! I didn't write this review right away, because quite frankly this book was in my head too much when I finished it. I am floored by this book, not just because the story so mind-bogglingly alluring, but because of everything else that came along with all of that gloriousness that is Fifty.<br /><br />Anastasia's shy inexperience is so polar opposite everything about Christian Grey, the rich and gorgeous entrepreneur with some serious baggage. But it's this innocence, not just when it comes to her sex life but also life in general, that drives Christian crazy and makes their relationship so unbelievably exciting. I went into this book knowing there would be a lot of steamy sex, but there's really no preparing for what E.L. James gives us with the mouth-watering Christian (aka \\"Fifty\\"). You can't be ready for the level of lust and passion he emanates, and James holds NOTHING back. What totally took me by surprise was that I found myself completely enthralled, not just with the (MANY) unforgettable scenes where Christian has his way with her, but with him and Ana as a couple. I never thought for one second this would turn into an actual deep, emotional relationship given how it started out, but boy was I wrong. And that just ups the ante; it's not just their passion that's at stake anymore, but their hearts, too.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts of this book, other than the steamy love scenes, was the humor that E.L. James so cleverly and expertly tosses into the story. It was so unexpected given what this story is really about, but I thoroughly enjoyed the humor. My favorite was Ana's constant battle with her \\"inner goddess\\" and her subconscious, both of which she had mental arguments with on a frequent basis. One of the best quotes from the book sums itup perfectly:<br /><br />\\"He seemed fine when I went into his study. We had sex...and then he wasn't. No, I don't get it. I look to my subconscious. She's whistling with her hands behind her back and looking anywhere but at me. She hasn't got a clue, and my inner goddess is still basking in a remnant of post-coital glow. No-we're all clueless.\\"<br /><br />I loved reading that her inner goddess was \\"doing back flips\\" over Christian or that her subconscious was berating her for not listening...it was quirky but hilarious! And those emails that Christian and Ana share throughout the story are so adorably cute, sweet, funny, and sexy, and it shows such a different side of them both. Seeing that side of them stirred up a whole new mix of feelings for me about this story, and it was brilliant.<br /><br />Christian truly is 50 shades of f*&ed up, and it creates a push-and-pull of the utmost pity and sheer anger directed at his character. There are a lot of women out there who will despise the message this book sends, and as I was reading it there was a (small) part of me that was questioning why I loved this story so much. But I think it goes well beyond the whole S&M factor here, showing what lies behind the curtain of someone like Christian. My heart ached for him once I started to learn more about why he was this way, and I wanted so badly for Ana to be able to save him. It's a fine line between wrong and right here, and E.L. James blurs that line by completely screwing with your head at every turn. She takes what could have been a cheesy romance novel and takes it to a whole new level. When I finished the book, I was exhausted; I felt like my brain and my heart had run an internal marathon. That ending, ohhh, good god...all I can say is I was SO glad this book had been out for awhile by the time I got my hands on it, and I started the sequel right away. Not sure I could have handled going about my day if things had ended there for me, that's how much this story affected me. I HIGHLY recommend this book; the story is beautiful and unforgettably sexy, and it will stay with you well past that last page.

B006VYFB1C|5.0|I love this movie.  I love to watch true story movies, and movies based off a true story, they're just so inspirational.  One of the best things about this movie is that despite the great actors (Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill), we get to see them in roles never played before, and they still pulled it off excellently.<br /><br />So this movie can seem super slow and have some scenes that would be irrelevant, but I personally feel that this whole movie sucks you into what's going on, and gets your mind thinking about how you would act if in any one of the main character's shoes.<br /><br />To see my full review check out: [...]<br /><br />Coming from Mom's Thumb Reviews

He's well read and usually reliable so I made a yummy cup of hot chocolate and pulled up a comfy chair and plunged into a rich and rewarding world.  A year later or so proud and excited owner of a kindle I'm shopping for more afternoons as pleasurable as that one.  Unfortunately for me, this book is priced for Kindle for more than it's priced to actually print it and ship it out.  Supply and demand as well as the quality and length of such a work demand a fair price, but to set that price at MORE then it would be to cut down trees, haul them to where they're turned into paper, cut them into book sized pieces, ship that to the printers, run them through... well you get the idea.  It's wrong.  It's the principle of the thing.  Sadly I won't be reading this one time I find it at a used book store.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Breaking bad is (in my opinion) the best show on television. Season four will have you at the edge of your seat every minute of every episode. The actors in breaking bad are amazingly realistic and they really make you believe they are the characters in real life. I am dying to watch season 5. I am dreading this show coming to an end.

B005GVA2L0|1.0|The wait for this album was long and arduous, much like the wait between Fallen and The Open Door.  Origins, their first album, is good.  Fallen is better.  The Open Door was well worth the wait.  With stronger vocals, better writing (the imagery was tremendous at times), and a harder, more visceral sound, it was a delight.  They even used parts of Mozart's Requiem in their music.  Imagine, with the several years wait between that and this album, what I was expecting.  Brilliance, to be sure.<br /><br />I bought the album, the Deluxe version, no less, loaded it right onto my iPhone, and listened.  Instead of the expected brilliance, I heard dribble.  Instead of Mozart, I heard the sounds of an old Atari game.  The fact that they couldn't even come up with a name for the album other than the band's name shows the lack of inspiration that is coming from the band now.  My Evanescence t-shirt is being retired.  I no longer want to be associated with a band that thinks it's okay to release such crap.<br /><br />As soon as I'm done writing this I'll be taking the album off of my iPhone, and then attempt to forget the cd ever existed.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I usually don't read zombie books, but World War Z is one of the best-written books I have ever read.  I have been recommending it to everyone I know.  The compelling tale brings the post apocalyptic world to life with amazing storytelling.
1451683405|2.0|Sam Harris has written this short book in order to argue that, contra our feeling otherwise, we do not have free will. And, if we are talking about the popular \\"folk\\" version of free will - where there is some core self inside of me making decisions unbounded by any constraints - then he does a good job. The book is written in direct and clear prose of a kind that Harris has delivered many times before.<br /><br />But as any kind of serious tract, this book really fails on multiple levels. The first and biggest failure is Harris's very quick, and wrong, dismissal of compatiblistic views about free will/determinism. Compatiblists (see [[ASIN:0142003840 Freedom Evolves]]) suggest that while all that we do is affected by causes, many of which 'we' have no conscious control over, we can at very least say that there are times in our lives where we can exercise intentions in a way we can call free. Harris dismisses this as changing the subject, and suggests that this is a type of faux freedom that just can't be called freedom in any real sense.<br /><br />To Harris, if there is no 'core self' that decides (basically out of thin air) to do or not do x, we don't have free will in ANY sense. So, I decided to purchase this Sam Harris book and that seemed a free choice. But, Harris will note, I cannot explain why I am interested in the subject (and this was likely a product of a certain chemical arrangement that no core-self part of me had control over). I cannot explain why it is that I valued the idea of the book over whatever else I could have spent money on (again, the result of a chemical process no 'core self' part of me had control over). And, certainly, I had no control over the fact that I came across the book (by chance on amazon) in the first place. (And the picture gets worse if I were to imagine a situation where I am a struggling dieter trying not to eat the dough nut placed in front of me; I seem to have EVEN LESS control there!)<br /><br />But compatiblists like Michael Gazzaniga ([[ASIN:0061906107 Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain]]) and Robert Kurzban ([[ASIN:0691146748 Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind]]) suggest that while there is no 'core self,' this simply doesn't mean we are not free in any way. They adopt a modular theory of mind that sees our brain as a set of modules, often operating below conscious awareness (calling the conscious part of our brain more of a 'press secretary' than an 'executive decision maker'). But does that mean that, just because (most of?) our deliberations are not taking place consciously, that we cannot say that 'we' are making the decision? No! Not unless we are saying that our brains are not us! When Harris says, for instance, that \\"some moments before you are aware of what you will do next... your brain has already determined what you will do,\\" (p. 9), how is Harris suggesting (as he is) that our brains are not us? This is because he is identifying 'you' with the core self and the 'your brain' with causes beyond its control. Compatiblists would rightly note that this is nonsensical. If our brains are deciding something (even if it is away from our conscious grasp), it is strange to say that we are being determined by causes beyond 'our' control (as the 'our' incorporates our brain).<br /><br />So, Harris may have successfully attacked the 'folk' concept of free will - with the little executive in the brain making decisions from scratch - but, if that is so, then ALL he has done is what others - including compatiblists! - have already done so well. And, in my judgment, the compatiblists win (so far).<br /><br />While Harris's above argument takes up most of the book, he does go into the implications for dropping the notion of free will in ethics and politics. And, again, I must say that he does a pretty poor job of it, devoting only a few pages to each (where others have devoted entire books to these subjects, with good reason). Harris suggests that adapting a determinist (not a fatalist) stance in ethics has made him more compassionate and forgiving, as he realizes that others are often victims of circumstance and luck. Of course, one could just as easily suggest that a full-fledged determinist (what Harris apparently is) could take this way too far. (Nor do I think any supporter of freedom of will would deny that many of our choices hinge on luck factors!) If everyone is the product of an environment, and we can trace everyone's personhood to many luck factors (where one was born, how one was raised, what one has been exposed to, etc), then it is all too easy to suggest that no one deserves anything at all and that the entire idea of desert is incoherent. (See John Rawls's [[ASIN:0674017722 A Theory of Justice: Original Edition]]). And if determinism is true, then x may not deserve their poverty, but neither can I be held accountable for alleviating it; y does not deserve to be sentenced for the crime, but z victim's death could be said to have been, in some way, destined. (And b judge who sentenced z to death may have just been determined to do it!)<br /><br />In these later parts of the book - maybe because he realizes that full determinism leads to these strange ideas - Harris tries to back off a bit without backing off. He suggests that punishment for crimes is justified as long as we can say that meting out such punishments may well modify peoples' behavior. (He also suggests that there may be psychic benefits to the idea of vengeance, but quickly drops that without explanation.) But how can we make sense of the idea that threat of punishment could modify potential behavior WITHOUT the idea that we CAN actually do otherwise? And better yet, how can we make sense of the idea without suggesting that we are CHOOSING to institute punishment after considering the matter in a way where we could go either way? Sounds like  choice to me!) Harris doesn't say it, and I doubt he'd acknowledge it, but it seems like, here, he really is trying to smuggle in a small idea about choice - that changing incentive structures may change whether people choose to commit the crime - without saying as much. (Harris will say this is not so, because changing incentives will change how each person weighs their options, and the weights they attach to each option is still beyond their conscious control; ergo, they are not free. I disagree, and think that as long as they have a theroetic choice about whether the crime is worth the cost, they are freely making that choice.)<br /><br />Well, there are the thoughts I have about this book. I have liked much of Harris's work in the past - [[ASIN:0393327655 The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason]], [[ASIN:0307278778 Letter to a Christian Nation]]. But his last three (starting with[[ASIN:143917122X The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values]]) have let me down a bit. And the problem with this book is largely the same type of problem with The Moral Landscape; that is, I am just not convinced that Harris understands others' positions enough to really understand the questions he is writing on. In the other book, he seems quite unaware that others have already addressed the problematics of his position, and here, he offers a very unconvincing argument against compatiblism (and a very incomplete discussion on ethics and politics after free will).<br /><br />The book is inexpensive, well written, and a decent primer, so buy it and read it. But I'd strongly recommend reading Gazzaniga's [[ASIN:0061906107 Who's in Charge?: Free Will and the Science of the Brain]] or Kurzban's very well-written [[ASIN:0691146748 Why Everyone (Else) Is a Hypocrite: Evolution and the Modular Mind]] as something of a rejoinder.

0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho is a well written fable. Although it is not the most interesting book in my opinion, it teaches lessons well and the author seems to be a very good writer. In this book, a young boy named Santiago leaves home to go on a long journey with his sheep, and he learns many life lessons along his way.<br /> I have read many different books in the past, and I would much rather read either something funny or something like Harry Potter that is far from realistic, or a combination of the two. In my opinion, humor is a good thing to keep a reader hooked on the book, and reading about things that could never happen in real life is something that I like.<br /> This book does a good job of teaching the reader that everyone has their own personal purpose for living life on Earth. Early on in the story, the main character, Santiago, learns that his Personal Legend is to go to the pyramids of Egypt and find a \\"treasure\\" that awaits him there. Along his journey to Egypt, he meets many other people who have their own personal legends. \\"You must go to the Pyramids of Egypt. I have never heard of them, but, if it was a child who showed them to you [in your dream], they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make you a rich man (Coelho 14).\\" Also, the author describes the various settings throughout the story very well.<br /> Coelho does a very good job of writing this book. It is easy to understand, and although it is not a funny book, I found it fairly easy to keep on reading without losing interest. Coelho describes very well the people that his main character meets throughout a long journey, and all the different things that happen to Santiago.<br /> The Alchemist is the book that made Paulo Coelho famous. None of his previous books sold nearly as well as this one. It has been translated into 67 languages and is sold in countries throughout the world.  I would recommend reading this book if you are looking for something that teaches you lessonsabout life, but not necessarily if you are looking for a book that gives pure entertainment through reading.

B0015DROBO|4.0|This book starts out with a meticulously slow plot. When the story finally plays out though, the story is well worth the time invested in reading it. I found Salender to be an almost heroic voice for real victims of violence,  or sexual abuse. One should not judge another based solely on social awkwardness. Besides the idea that the nonconformists of society are pigeonholed in some cultures, it gives one reasons to not opt for prejudicial attitudes when assessing another's intelligence.<br /><br />I found the author's viewpoint on the way social misfits are misjudged to be not only refreshing, but also accurate. Victims of these types of abuse have a variety of defence mechanisms and are often miscategorized in relation to their level of mental accuity. This character could demonstrate the real possibility that although a person may be socially inept, that peers nor officials should deem them to be unworthy of respect.<br /><br />Well done Mr. Larsson! As an adult survivor of abuse, I thank you for giving others a reason to pause before labeling me unintelligent simply based on my social graces (or lack thereof).

B0067Q04AM|5.0|I first learned of Robert Glasper in 2009, when I heard his outstanding version of \\"Maiden Voyage/Everything in its Right Place\\" from the In My Element release.  Since then, I have delved into his catalog and found it to be outstanding on many levels.  The work Glasper, and his extensive list of collaborators, has been doing in the past few years is nothing short of game-changing.  Black Radio takes this to another level.  This album is a musical and creative silver bullet.  I have found myself deeply moved by it numerous times in the week since I first got my hands on it.  My expectations were set extremely high leading up to the release, yet somehow Black Radio exceeds them.  I will admit that I was skeptical of the extensive electronic element Casey Benjamin was planning to bring to the table before I heard the album.  However, I could not help but to be completely won over by Benjamin's contributions on Black Radio.  A dynamic musician working with multiple instruments, he projects rich vulnerability in his vocoder work on several tracks, and takes the lead on the outstanding \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\".  Chris Dave and Derrick Hodge are in a league of their own on drums and bass from start to finish.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this album highly enough to do it justice.  It is, quite simply, mind blowing.  I suggest you do as I did and experience it without interruption and via headphones, especially on the first listen.<br /><br />This is the best album of 2012, and one of the best of all time.

B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's first new album in over three years is the most experimental in terms of sound.  Replacing Brendan O'Brien as producer with Ron Aniello, the album employs sound loops, choir sounding backing vocals, heavy strings and other sounds that you would not expect from Mr. Springsteen.  This is not an E Street Band album as the majority of the band is either completely absent or appear sporadically throughout the album.  The title track was originally written and performed in 2009 on the Working On A Dream tour as a tribute to Giants Stadium which Mr. Springsteen had many triumphant shows in his native state.  While the song appears on the album in pretty much the same form as the live version, a loving ode to past glories, it has a different meaning for the album title. The wrecking ball is a not so subtle metaphor for what Wall Street and the one percenters have done to the American dream.  Just three years ago he was singing about working on that dream and now it has been smashed.  Songs like \\"Shackled And Drawn\\" and \\"Easy Money\\" sing about the common man having to do hard and harsh work or turn to crime to live like the fat cats up on the hill.  With the first single \\"We Take Care Of Our Own\\" has crafted yet another majestic anthem that questions whether people in the country have lost their faith in the flag and their fellow countrymen.  Mr. Springsteen once sang about his hometown slowly dying in \\"My Hometown\\" and now twenty eight years later his town is dead.  \\"Death To My Hometown\\" has a hard edged Celtic beat with pounding fife and drums that sounds like it was drawn from his recent time spent with The Dropkick Murphys.  He angrily sings about how the robber barons stole his town without even firing a single shot.  \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\" has long been a concert staple (it closed most of the Reunion tour shows in 99-00 and appeared on the Live In New York City cd) and it was performed in an Impressions gospel soul style.  It has been reworked a bit with a gospel choir and a harder guitar edge, but it does feature a flawless sax solo from the late great Clarence Clemons (he also appears on the title track). It serves as a fitting last piece for the Big Man as his sax beckons us to board the train one last time for the Promised Land.  \\"We Are Alive\\" ends the standard edition of the album with a horn section clipped from \\"Ring Of Fire\\" and serves as a final call to those who have passed before us.  There a some slips on the album like \\"You've Got It\\" which is a mediocre love song that seems thrown on to break up all the base anger, \\"Rocky Ground\\" which starts off well but features a rap solo at the end which is as bizarre and hideous as you would expect and \\"This Depression\\" which has a monotone, repetitive beat and sound.  Mr. Springsteen faces the same problem of all artists that have been around for almost forty years.  People want him to record another Born To Run or Darkness, but instead of giving into that urge, he is pushing the boundaries of his own sound.  While Wrecking Ball is not on the level of his classic work, it is a compelling piece of music that will challenge you to listen a little closer.bit with a gospel choir and a harder guitar edge, but it does feature a flawless sax solo from the late great Clarence Clemons (he also appears on the title track).

B005XBA9Y8|4.0|Just received the box with all 51 CDs. The contents is probably wonderful; I will write more later, but what were they thinking at Mercury.

A real disservice to collectors everywhere. Shame!

The price Amazon was offering this for was too good to turn down. I recommend it to any Western movie collectors. With TV getting worse every year it is good to have a good movie you can watch now and then.
B003E6K1VK|1.0|Always a distortion there. I tried the E7, the E11 and the other one that I think may be the E6. I'm no expert, my guess is that when these companies try to create a DAC (Digital to Analog Converter) as well as an amp, it's compromised by quality.<br /><br />All Fiio head-amps/DAC's that I tried (and I think I tried them all), made all kinds of music sound like it had a tone of distortion and harshness added to it. It would sound okay but upping the volume is becomes painful.<br /><br />I still use a cheapy little ZO amp from a few years ago because it only adds bass and amperage. Simple and hard to screw up.<br /><br />So I tried to \\"burn\\" them in for awhile, some say it helps. But it just continues to sound awful. Amazon doesnt offer too much else except Fiio, so I would keep looking.<br /><br />I finally found what I was looking for in a Fostex that turned out to be great and mobile, just pricey (at BH Photo Video)..

068987474X|3.0|...it should be THEMSELVES!<br /><br />Part of the problem with women (and I am a woman) is that they expect a man to relate to them as a woman. Since men do not have the capacity to relate to women as a woman - and few women have super female-to-female relationships with their girlfriends, women are much better off being into themselves.<br /><br />Instead of women depending upon a man (and way too many American women rely upon men for second-hand esteem) to boost their ego, having a healthy sense of self-esteem takes the place of seeking out men.<br /><br />The author seems to have written the book from a \\"boys who grew up along the side of girls\\" view. Contrary to popular belief, boys brought up away from females, educated at boys' schools, never learn how to act badly around the female gender like boys do in public schools. Between the ages of 2 and 10, boys eschew the presence of girls, disliking them, verbally acting badly whenever they are around girls. Likewise girls act the same way: disliking the male gender, thinking it weird how a girl can even like a boy. Sadly, due to this form of socialization, males never outgrow their perpetual dislike of women and will try to seek relationships elsewhere: for many men, it is with other men (non-sexual), for the rest, a lifetime of disappointment with women, no matter how hard they try to relate to them, they discover that they cannot, then the damage is done.<br /><br />If boys and girls brought up together were socialized differently, these sort of problems would not arise.

0393338827|5.0|A lot has been written about the recent financial crisis over the last three years and anyone who wants to understand the genesis of the crisis and the profits that certain individuals and firms made from repackaging subprime mortgages can turn to numerous sources. But in typical fashion, Lewis is able to turn his topic into a gripping read of the rise and fall of the subprime securitization market and the few people that had the insight and foresight to understand what was happening and bet against it. Without trying to cover every major player and every event leading up to the collapse of Bear and Lehman, Lewis focuses on a handful of individuals that provide the reader insight into the market at the time as a whole and how so many of the people involved barely understood what they were a part of.<br /><br />More than just a historical account of the events leading up to the fall of 2008, this is an epic story from one of today's greatest writers and storytellers. This book will probably never be as infamous or as culture-shaping as Liar's Poker, but it is a fitting and telling follow-up.
