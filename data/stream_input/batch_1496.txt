B004I2K4DY|5.0|LES MISERABLES 25th Anniversay Concert is beautifully done and a lovely rendition of this musical adaptation of Victor Hugo's incomparable novel.  Though the staging of this new version has been revised from the 1995 concert version, and the cast is not as widely known, yet, (except for Lea Salonga, imho) as the stellar 1995 Concert Performance, this is still a magnificent and glorious performance, always deeply touching and heart-wrenching.  The singer/actors are superb: Alfie Boe, Lea Salonga, Jenny Galloway, Norm Lewis, Samantha Jane Barks, Ramin Karimloo, and a surprisingly sweet and warm performance as \\"Marius\\" by pop singer Nick Jonas.  LES MISERABLES is a stunning, extraordinary musical, my personal all time best-loved favorite, and that by far, since the 1980s. This 25th Anniversary production is, hands-down, far and away THE FINEST performance of Les Miserables that I have ever seen in my life, whether on stage or a concert version, and it is well-worth having in your DVD library and I might add, well-worth watching as often as you can.  The spirit always needs a re-ennobling from time to time, and this beautiful story always accomplishes that.<br />LES MIS' is the most intense, yet tender, loving, merciful and, in the end, uplifting musical ever composed for the stage. A metaphor for the victory of God's Mercy over Justice (yet not in conflict with real justice, of the Redemption of sinners triumphing, instead of their destruction.  It is the story of a man who, by Divine Aid (grace) goes from being a vengeful and hate-filled man, to a living saint whose heart and mercy and kindness are as immense, as his humility is profound.  LES MIS' is every bit as monumental, as a theatre-piece, as is Victor Hugo's novel as a literary work.  It simply, far and away, has no equal in the musical theatre, and I believe that it never will.  LES MISERABLES is, truly, incomparable.  When the good souls from heaven (the Garden of the Lord) sing the saintly Valjean into the Kingdom at the end, the crusade that they are calling you and I to join is not one of politics, bombs, or armed revolts or Political Parties or ideologies, but rather one of reverence and of mercy, kindness, forgiveness, compassion and generosity for each other that has never been heard of, or equalled before, in this Life. This play is gentle, touching, charming, painful at times, and warm. It openly advocates faith, repentance, self-sacrifice for others's sakes, it advocates decency, goodness, and kindness; it promotes cleansed and generous hearts. As Victor Hugo put it, regime changes are never enough: HEARTS MUST CHANGE.  That is a \\"crusade\\" well worth joining:  Tomorrow, Come!!/>Tomorrow, COME !!

B00845POUO|5.0|This movie is about as real as it gets. Does it follow every detail in the man's life exactly as it happened ? Of course not ! It's a movie ! And a very good one.  If you don't like the message , move on , friend . Too bad it didn't have a wider release. But other people are confronting this Joseph Kony madman in lots of different ways . He's now in hiding , thanks to the efforts of people like Sam Childers .  So , like he says in the movie , Childers must be doing something right.

B005TF06H8|5.0|I've never been a big fan of so-called \\"Teen\\" shows, especially anything dealing with supernatural. But I have to say VD has a very captive story that keeps you coming back to see the next episode. The daily life choices everyone has are imbedded into the storyline. However, I do not approve of the teen drinking, you can call it being real or not, still does not make it ok to advocate. Any-hoo, the viewing quality with Amazon Prime is awesome download is fast and purchase was supper simple easy.
B0076XDGZ0|4.0|You'll find the songs contained on this CD stuck in your head for quite a while.  When I heard of the artists who were participating on this project, I pre-ordered immediately.  I was not disappointed.  The music goes from epic prog with tracks like \\"Infinite Fire\\", to power ballads with tracks like \\"Kayla\\".  Very catchy melodies, superb instrumentation with very few low points.  My favorite track is the uplifting and catchy track \\"the Storm\\".  The only track I find myself skipping is \\"Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda\\" which I consider to be quite weak.<br />Sad that they won't be coming anywhere near me during their mostly European tour.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this album at any price, but for $5 its a steal.

0553386794|5.0|A GAME OF THRONES has become one of the few exceptions in the fantasy genre that rises into the pop-culture canon.  A GAME OF THRONES, the first book in the A Song of Ice and Fire Series, has achieved this rare status for very good reasons; it's extremely well written, it's engaging, and there's something here for everyone to like: political intrigue, strategic warfare, fully-realized characters, sex and violence, and intricate setting history.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin has created a believable and very detailed world with its own long history.  Every character has a history, a family, a life outside of the narrative.  Family histories are large but collected at the back of the book in an appendix for convenience (and it doesn't contain spoilers).  The depth of these characters are necessary: the author switches point of view frequently between a set of characters in this novel.  This technique proves to be highly effective: readers are constantly kept on their toes by the shifting points of view, and more of the setting/characters can be covered by having the narrative told from good guys, bad guys, and in-between-guys.  Unlike in other series, it never feels as if the reader is fighting against the narrative; story and setting elements are told at a good pace without ever feeling daunting or esoteric.<br /><br />The only issue this book has is its status as the introduction to the series.  A GAME OF THRONES is very long, and it takes a while for it to pick up.  Those readers that are accustomed to the genre will probably not have an issue with this, but it seems that some casual readers are not patience enough to wait for the story to fully develop.  For that reason, it's hard to say whether or not a reader will really enjoy A GAME OF THRONES until about three-quarters into the novel.<br /><br />There are consistent complaints about this series from other readers: there is sex, there is violence, the \\"bad guys\\" sometimes win, the \\"good guys\\" sometimes lose, and the plotting can become complicated.  This novel can be considered to have an R-rating.  The sex and violence never feels overly gratuitous (unlike in its counterpart HBO series).  The characters are shaded with different aspects of good and evil, so it is hard to say that characters are wholly good or wholly evil.  The book never feels oppressive in its characterization of \\"good\\" vs \\"evil.\\"  The plotting can become complicated, but it never feels convoluted.  Each plot thread as a clear and precise line.<br /><br />I loved the hell out of this book.  Readers who enjoy this installment who love later books CLASH OF KINGS and onward.  I would recommend this novel to fans of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series or Stephen King's The Dark Tower series.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER:  This novel was read in the paperback edition.  Kindle users beware, the electronic edition has its own set of mistakes, errors, and bugs.  If you are interested in this book, opt with the analog version over the digital (even if digital is more convenient).nd the plotting can become complicated.

0307592731|2.0|Overall, maybe this book is a good memoir, but as for being what it tried to sell in its title/description (a book about a three month journey in the wilderness on the PCT), it completely and utterly failed in my opinion.<br />I was so excited to read this book after reading an excerpt of it in a magazine. But, I was really really disappointed. When you see a book called \\"Wild\\", read a description of it that talks about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, encountering various animals and dealing with harsh conditions, you expect the book to be about being on that trail, living in raw nature. But she spent so much time off trail! Getting rides, staying in a hostel, taking showers (!), playing a slot machine?! This book shouldn't be called \\"Wild\\" and it shouldn't say it concentrates on the PCT, because it is really only about bumming around California and Oregon for a few months. She went through so much money, you shouldn't need money when you are supposed to be hiking a trail for three months.<br />No matter how hard I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, I just hated the author. She just seems so pretentious!! She speaks so nonchalantly about using heroin for these short periods of time and then not using it so easily, when heroin is a terrible terrible drug and ruins the lives of so many people. Oh and don't get me started on her writing about her sexual appetite. It was just gross how she would constantly talk about how she would sleep with anyone at all even if she wasn't attracted to them. The fact that she analyzed every man she met on the trail sexually was just too too much, like, really? You would really just give in if they tried to make a move on you? And then she'd try to portray this scared female when she was alone with some men, completely contradicting herself over and over. There is nothing wrong with loving sex, but I just hated hated hated the way she'd talk about it.<br />Another thing I didn't like was the fact that most of the book spoke about things before her hike. Again, I was expecting a book about her journey on the trail!! The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one was because I like the parts where she would discuss the people she met on the trail, and I also liked the few parts about actually being on the trail. Although the latter were pretty poorly written for the most part. She just skimmed over them so quickly...Oh I almost walked into a rattlesnake, oh well...Oh yeah, I just remembered, I'm in this beautiful place, maybe I should mention that for one second...Oh hey, a bear! And yet she would go into such excruciating detail about everything else (like the death of her mom, killing her horse! or the issues with her stupid feet, oh my god I got so sick of reading about her feet!!!!!)<br />I could probably go on and on about how disappointed I was in the book and how much I don't like the author, but I'm going to stop because this review is crazy long. Don't read this if you want an account of being in raw nature for three months. Just don't bother.

B000HC2LI0|1.0|I bought this set for my husbands birthday in March. We just started to watch it in may. There are already two CDs that do not have anything on them and the DVD player and computer both say the discs are blank. We have not gotten through the whole set. I can only image how many are blank. I was a bit worried when the CDs came in a round case instead of the Complete Series folder. It seems like the seller has burnt CD to make more copies of the original. I have also emailed the seller to see if I could return the set but I have never heard back. I suggest very strongly not to buy from this seller.

B000IKQMFO|2.0|The story and cast are good. I was attracted to this title because it was written by Julian Fellowes, the creator and writer of Downton Abby, the sensational Masterpiece Theatre serial shown on PBS.  This film disappointed because the dialog was difficult (or impossible) to hear or decipher, throughout the picture. Sub-titles were NOT available either. There is a large cast of characters, many of the men and women looking enough alike so it took 3/4 viewings for me to sort it all out and figure out most of the relationships in the picture. I am still not sure about some of the characters in the subplots?  I would quickly buy another version, if it was offered with subtitles.

078322947X|2.0|After having seen \\"Wages Of Fear\\" I was eager to see \\"Sorcerer\\", and as great a movie as it is, the DVD is presented in full screen format (yeccch!) and apparently transferred from a substandard master. I wish I could give two ratings, one for the movie itself (5 stars) and another for presentation (less than 1 star) but the rating system doesn't allow this so until a newer iteration appears, my rating will have to remain as it is.
0765357151|5.0|Robert Neville blockades himself in his home every night to ward off the hordes of vampires that have overtaken the world.  By day, he slays the undead in their sleep and researches their affliction, never suspecting what he himself is turning into.<br /><br />Richard Matheson's seminal horror/SF novel is a terse, gripping tale of loneliness and a meditation on what it means to be human and what it means to be a monster.  There is plenty of vampire action, but what really touched me was Matheson's depiction of Neville's reaction to solitude: his drinking, his melancholy reminiscences of his wife and daughter, his battle against despair, his heartbreaking attempt to befriend a dog, and the redemptive power in simply being seen and recognized by a sympathetic soul.

It has a great combination of really feeling 3d, with bright visuals/colors, and still having some nice moments where you feel like you can touch something.

B004UC4HCG|5.0|So far extremely pleased with this case/motherboard combo.<br /><br />- Intel i7 3770 3.4GHz(Ivy Bridge)<br />- Crucial 128GB M4 SSD<br />- Western Digital 1TB 3.5\\" Drive (existing)<br />- Corsair XMS3 16GB (2 x 8GB) 1600MHz<br />- Sony Blu-Ray Burner BWU-500S<br />- Arctic Silver 5 Thermal Compound<br /><br />First of all, I love the look and size of the case.  I finally got rid of that big annoying tower case with all the noisy fans.  Now I have a nice, compact PC that fits on my desk nicely.  Generally, it is very quiet (especially compared to my old tower).  The entire case has 1 big fan (in addition to the Power Supply fan).  That fan cools the CPU out the back through the built in CPU heat pipe cooling system.  CPU runs pretty cool.  Maxed out, the maximum CPU temp I saw was 64°C.<br /><br />I wanted to go with the newest Ivy Bridge CPU.  That requires this case to arrive with a Version 2 Motherboard and at least version 201 of the BIOS.  I was a little worried that I might end up getting an older case that wasn't updated for Ivy Bride.  Well, it was good to go.  I got the v2 case and v201 of the BIOS.  I did update the BIOS to the lastest v202 without any troubles.  The Motherboard does not allow for overclocking.  So I did not buy a (K) unlocked CPU.<br /><br />The interior is designed to handle all the cables well.  You could put in a video card, but I made sure to put in a CPU with the latest Intel HD4000 graphics so I don't need one.  If you do go with a video card, make sure it's not too powerful as the power supply can only handle a mid-range or lower card. I'm not gaming, so it wasn't a concern for me.<br /><br />I do think I might try replacing the case fan with a ultra-quiet model.  Not that it really needs it, but I'm being really picky.<br /><br />After building this system, I can't imagine needing a big tower case anymore.  If you want to overclock and put in a big powerful Video Card, consider the Shuttle SZ77R5 or SZ68R5 cases. They are the same size cases but with bigger power supply's and overclocking mother boards.
1450419895|4.0|The Strength Training Anatomy Workout II is a detailed and interesting book geared towards those with advanced and intermediate weight lifting skills as the book assumes the reader is already very familiar with weight training strategies and exercises.  This is a great reference for those who have reached a plateau in their workout and/or are interested in isolating and better developing weak areas.  The book is arranged in three sections.  Section one discusses current understandings of muscle development and why certain training changes may or may not affect one's progress.  Section two discusses each muscle group in turn.  For each muscle group, the anatomy is described and illustrated, obstacles to muscle development are discussed and numerous exercises are described and illustrated.  The last section lists a variety of training programs.<br /><br />I am a fan of Delavier's books.  I find they are easy to use and good references to have handy.  The illustrations are terrific and the text gets right to the point.

0857520652|5.0|Rachel Joyce's debut novel, THE UNLIKELY PILGRIMAGE OF HAROLD FRY, is a true gem. Joyce has the gift of storytelling and gives us a couple of captivating characters in Harold Fry and his wife, Maureen.<br /><br />The story begins slowly and gradually picks up steam. Harold Fry seems at first to be boringly ordinary, but as the details of his life unfold, you learn of his desperately unhappy and loveless childhood and how it stunted his ability to function properly as a husband and father, and you come to feel deeply for this damaged old man as he tries to do one good thing in his life. That thing is to spontaneously undertake a walk of over five hundred miles to see a dying friend, Queenie Hennessy, hoping against hope that his 'pilgrimage' might somehow keep her alive.<br /><br />They say there are really only a couple of plots for most fiction. One is a new person comes to town. The other is someone goes on a journey. HAROLD FRY is a classic example of the latter. Harold is a sad man, trapped in a marriage that seems, for all practical purposes, to be over. When he decides suddenly to walk to the hospice where Queenie, a colleague he betrayed twenty years ago, lies dying, he walks with a determination, through pain, weather and other hardships, that indicates \\"he wasn't so much walking to Queenie as away from himself.\\" And in the course of his walk, Harold gradually becomes a changed man.<br /><br />Harold's wife Maureen changes too, as she begins to realize, despite their twenty years of separate rooms and silences, how much she misses Harold once he's gone. She suddenly knows, as she buys her \\"single pork chop,\\" that \\"however lonely she was with Harold, the world without him would seem even more desolate.\\"<br /><br />In the course of his journey, Harold meets a wide array of people and learns their secrets and also the kindness of strangers. When the media gets wind of his walk, Harold draws a large and motley retinue of 'disciples,' who tarnish the purity of his intention. I thought of Forrest Gump 's run across the USA, as Harold and his quarrelsome tee-shirted and thoroughly dysfunctional 'PILGRIM' army moved steadily north up the map of England. (And yes, I got out my atlas and traced his journey as I read.) Harold's age and his walk also brought to mind a mostly forgotten but delightful little road trip film I saw many years ago, with Art Carney and a cat - Harry & Tonto [DVD] [Region 1] [US Import] [NTSC] .<br /><br />Harold Fry didn't have a cat, but author Joyce did give him a dog, named, simply, Dog. One wonders if there is perhaps some wryly dyslexic symbolism here, particularly when Harold seems to lose his way and Dog abandons him.<br /><br />The final fifty pages or so of the book are a study in sadness, wisdom and redemption, and kept me reading into the wee hours. Quite simply, HAROLD FRY and his long journey to understanding is a quietly beautiful little book. I recommend it highly.<br /><br />- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVERs intention.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Wow this book is just wow,<br />reading this book is like reading a porno...no lie\\"!. every chapter had at least 2 sex scenes and they were very districtive. So much information every touching, every filling, every sucking !!!! everthing very districtive .. that you are just like wow. It has been comfired that there is going to be a movie about this book well it should be rated triple R because its just going to have sexual content the whole movie. I am in shock because i saw an eight year old the other day reading this book I was like ..do her parents know the amount of adult content in this book really!!! Other than that the love story is somewhat tragic. The ending is going to leave you in a clifft hanger. It's some what worth it if you are very romantic and fully love sex.

I suggest this book to be in your library, you never know when you or someone you know will have a stroke and what can or should you do from the onset of the stroke through the recovery.  She has a delightful style.  I admit I glossed over some of the intricate brain details however it is a fantastic read.

B004FOA84A|2.0|It's your basic click-and-explore game.  Only two real &quot;puzzles,&quot; everything else is find the key, unlock a door, find a doodad, use it to get another key.  And of those puzzles, I only solved one, and did the other through trial and error.  Also, the ending is terrible.  Not a good use of your time.

B0074VTHKM|5.0|Theodore Boone is brilliant, curious, outgoing and his passion is to study law and one day become a lawyer. His curiosity and his dream is the influence of his parents, who are both lawyers. Of course, they are proud of their thirteen year old son with high standards and ambition. Theodore finds it fascinating that he's lucky enough to attend the hearing for Duffy, who was charged with killing his wife. Theodore knows Pete Duffy well and as much as he does everyone who lives in the small town where he resides. As the court-room drama becomes intense and as opposed to what the towns-people believe, Theodore has his own doubts about the innocence of Duffy. Then, the unexpected happens, and Theodore become a suspect in a crime of theft in a local computer store. Did Duffy kill his wife? Was the young Theodure framed for the crime theft? John Grisham delivers another thrilling Masterpiece that's aimed to please! The characters are unique, court-room proceedings have you addicted to the story, and there's never a dull moment. There is much to ponder with questions throughout the compelling story, very thought-provoking with perfect setting. The court-room drama becomes as explosive as it does in 'PRESUMED INNOCENT.' Entertaining from beginning to end and highly recommended for all thriller lovers, who enjoy intense suspense. This novel is another gem, created by a Master storyteller. Very Enjoyable!
B000QE9ERK|3.0|The book (The Club Dumas) that this movie is based on has a lot of postmodern elements, with the protagonist, Corso, occasionally believing that he is a character in a book, parallelism to the Three Musketeers, Moby Dick, and the COunt of Monte Cristo in various places, and intentionally archetypal/transtextual characters.  Oh, and the devil, sort of.<br /><br />It's much better for it; and none of that fun intertextuality actually came through in the movie.  The movie manages to pull off a gothic occult thriller vibe, but the book is far deeper (or, more specifically, \\"richer by association,\\" in case you didn't look up \\"intertextuality\\")
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Much better film than expected. Moves along quickly. I'm hoping for<br />a sequel, but with the poor attendance in the theater, due to poorly<br />made previews and advertisements, I doubt there will a sequel,<br />much the pity.

0345803485|2.0|I had to read this book based on the hype even though I dont get the whole vampire/erotica genre which was done two decades ago by Anne Rice, an author who now seems to be forgotten. I agree with the reviewer who said this was written by a teenager - apart from the sex, it reads as YA. Hard for real women to relate to the goings on of a twenty two year old virgin or believe she would interest Mr Grey for long.<br />The so-called erotica wouldn't appeal to any real BDSM fan but I believe that it's the Mr Darcy factor that has given this book such huge sales - It strikes a chord with every woman who wants to seduce that unavailable man and have him change his character 'For Her' when all previous lovers have miserably plummeted after flying too close to the sun.<br />The ending is as manipulative as a soap opera and I for one won't be tuning in for a predictable part two.

B0048LPRD2|1.0|There was a lot I had in mind, in terms of expectations, as to what this movie could offer in beauty and landmark expression. I believe Film as a medium is more or less a tool for the artist and all artists (actors, musicians, etc.) to create sincere art. What I found in \\"Enter the Void\\" was not what I expected and I was not pleased by this at all.<br /><br />There are a ton of experimental films, films about drugs, films about Tibetan Buddhism, and films about death that are less cohesive and still give the viewer/audience something to walk away with. I feel as though in some ways, \\"Enter the Void\\" was an exploitation of the audience as dumb. Movies like \\"The Tree of Life,\\" \\"Pi,\\" \\"Waking Life,\\" \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" even \\"Fight Club,\\" work with a non-linear or experimental form of media to create their overall \\"point\\" as a piece of art. What I found in \\"Enter the Void\\" was excessive use of genitalia, flashing lights, hovering cameras, and flat characters to create a \\"point\\" that entering the void just happens and can happen at any time. I won't spoil anything, but the excesses of sex at the end of the movie don't really provide except for in that semi-symbolic way that some scenes do in other movies.<br /><br />Most of the scenes in this movie repeat to the point of nausea, and it's a wonder why anyone would sit through the same four scenes over and over and over again. There is a car crash which is repeatedly used as a crutch for the two \\"main\\" characters, which really doesn't add to their character as much as it does to the plot. Those two characters whose parents die end up becoming 1) a drug addict and 2) a stripper. The characters in this movie seem victimized by life and in a way, don't provide anything for the \\"Void\\" in terms of meaning.<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is that there is a repetition in this movie that makes you feel stupid: gratuitous sex that's supposed to be artsy because the genitalia is glowing (I'd frankly rather watch an artistically made piece of pornography); glorified, short-term drug use that really doesn't do anything for drug use or the expansion of consciousness (movies like \\"Trainspotting\\" do a much better job, even if they don't intend to); finally, pseudo-philosophy as well as pseudo-spiritualism (I don't get the point if you're taking both reason and faith out of the film) that comes probably unintended from the lack of dialogue and blandness of the characters.<br /><br />It is certainly worth testing the waters on, but I frankly don't like the film. If you're absolutely set on watching it, go ahead, but be prepared to understand where it is going. There isn't any wonder about the film. Everything is given away after the first hour. Then you are left vegetating in front of the screen. It seems to be one of those postmodern statements about the audience, how we're willing to watch anything as long as it is done differently. I expect more from this medium and not to be considered so simple to please.

1410430103|1.0|I tried so hard to enjoy this book but was put off by the HORRENDOUS writing. The plot is very interesting and had it been written well it would be great but the authors use of short sentences makes the book very annoying to read. It reads like an adult See Spot Run. Ex. The men came in. They wore all black. It was night time. The road was quiet. No cars in sight. She crept in behind them. Everything was quiet. THE END. This author needs to take a writing class!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because the theme seemed intriguing and it was highly talked about. From the first few pages I was not impressed with the writing. That's usually when I put the book down and go onto something else. However, since this trilogy has been making such a fuss, I decided to see it out. Unlike some readers, it took me weeks to finish. I just had to put it down or I would throw it across the room. The writing is elementary and the story and characters, though they could have had great potential, are set for junior high school readers. I would compare this to the Twilight Trilogy which was also very juvenile.<br /><br />If you are a young teenage girl or actually have a \\"vanilla\\" sex life yourself, you may enjoy these books. But a grown, mature woman may not be entertained by the female character's constant reference to \\"her sex\\" as well as the blatant unrealistic plot of the whole book.<br /><br />This topic could have been very well written if it was geared to a mature, realistic level and better written.<br /><br />I can't possibly waste my reading time with the next two books. Very disappointing, indeed.

0812550706|5.0|I called this book the Best SF Story Ever. Big claim. But not bigger than claiming Jimi Hendrix is the best electric guitarist ever. Everyone knows it. Same thing with Ender's Game.<br /><br />There are few books this original, capable of creating an entire world, culture, and universe. This one does it. Visionary.<br /><br />Earth, its colonies, and its culture under attack by an alien race. No weapon or strategy capable of beating them. How then to truly think outside the box? Create a total new strategy in a \\"vacuum\\"? Sequester the best and brightest kids off-planet. Let them create teams, tribes, groups; let them create. And they do. The result is Ender (Andrew) Wiggins. Not just a prodigy, but a re-inventor of strategy. This book is heart-stoppingly real. And will attain a permanent place on your shelf. And in your mind.

030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" is the story of thirty-four Nick Dunne and his thirty-eight year old wife, Amy Elliott.  When Nick's parents become ill, Nick and Amy move from New York to Nick's birthplace in Missouri, where they rent a house.  North Carthage is a bleak \\"miniature ghost town\\" on the banks of the Mississippi River and Amy loathes it.  Nick's asking Amy to come with him to Missouri, it turns out, is tantamount to throwing a lit match into a pile of tinder doused with gasoline.<br /><br />Nick and Amy have been married for five years.  Amy's sizeable trust fund (courtesy of her parents' successful books about a perfect female named \\"Amazing Amy\\" who has grown from \\"a precocious moppet of six\\" to \\"a thirty-year-old bride to be\\") has shrunk.  Although Nick and Amy once had incredible chemistry, they now bring out the worst in one another.  Their crumbling marriage takes a weird turn when, on the day of their fifth anniversary, Amy vanishes.  The police find blood, signs of a struggle, and other evidence that points to a violent intruder hurting Amy and then abducting her.  As time goes on, other clues implicate Nick who, the authorities suspect, may have murdered his spouse in a fit of rage.<br /><br />The author has a field day playing with our minds.  Flynn alternates points of view in chapters that Nick and Amy each narrate.  Since their stories conflict, the question remains:  Who is telling the truth?  Is Nick a sadistic husband who grew tired of his wife and decided to get rid of her?  Is Amy a dutiful helpmate whom Nick does not appreciate and no longer loves?  Or is she a manipulative harpy?  We are kept guessing and wondering as the plot becomes increasingly unpredictable.  The imaginative descriptive writing and sharply-honed, sardonic dialogue keep us involved throughout this 415-page book.<br /><br />Flynn skillfully explores the warped minds of narcissistic and devious individuals.  Nick is far from blameless, but Amy may not be the deferential and tolerant woman that she describes in her diary.  Initially, we do not know what to think about Nick and Amy's dysfunctional relationship.  As the narrative progresses, answers begin to emerge, and Flynn throws in multiple twists, causing us to question all of our previous assumptions.  \\"Gone Girl\\" has a varied and lively cast that includes Nick's blunt sister, several predatory females, passive-aggressive and smothering parents, clueless detectives, and rapacious reporters. Nick and Amy know each other too well, the better to attack where it hurts the most.  \\"Gone Girl\\" is a psychological and witty thriller about a hate-filled pair who make the Macbeths look like Ozzie and Harriet.and tolerant woman that she describes in her diary.

B007D15N1K|5.0|'A written work that is regarded as having artistic merit'. That is how my dictionary describes 'literature'. This book is a literary romance - and a novel, too.<br /><br />  'Possession' by A S Byatt is one of my very favourite books, which I have read perhaps five or six times. It is one of the few books that I prefer in its printed form - for visual reasons. I have recently bought and read it on my Kindle - and am glad to have it available even on my mobile phone: but I prefer my dog-eared paperback copy. It's the layout of the poetry that does it.<br /><br />  A few of the times I have read the whole book; some of the times I have skated over the long poems and sagas that Miss Byatt has written in the style of her Victorian hero, the eminent poet Professor Randolph Henry Ash. To me, there is no doubting the artistic merit of this double love story, which is so crafted that one is driven through with impatience, fascinated to know the final outcome(s). Shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1990, I wondered why it had not won but my conclusion was that the judges felt that the author indulged herself by not thinning out so much apparently irrelevant but beautiful prose. As a practised reader of this romance, I now know what to leave out - and still end up by enjoying the brilliant plots and passionate love stories.<br /><br />  A S Byatt quotes Nathaniel Hawthorne, in the preface to his 'The House of the Seven Gables' as saying that 'When a writer calls his work a Romance, it need hardly be observbed that he wishes to claim a certain latitude, both as to its fashion and material, which he would not have felt himself entitlted to assume, had he professed to be writing a Novel. The latter form of composition is presumed to aim at a very minute fidelity, not merely to the possible, but to the probable and ordinary course of man's experience.'<br /><br />  The author gives me no reason to dispute her facts and I am convinced that Randolph Ash and his virginal lover bothexisted. Equally real are the humble academic, Roland Mitchell (who discovered the draft letters by Prof Ash that no one knew about) and the formidable Dr Maud Bailey, feminist and expert on women poets of the same period, (around the 1860s).  It is definitely romantic, convincing and artistic. So, from me five stars because 'I love it!' And I conclude it's a true example of modern literature.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|You can definitley tell that this started as a fanfic. That is about the quality of writing you will get out of it. Do we really live in a society where books written with this lack of skill get published and sell like crazy? With all the talented authors out there, you have to wonder how this book has done so well. The repetitive descriptions are atrocious... Another commenter with the help of their kindle put up a tally. Anytime you use the same phrase 120+ times in one book, you have a problem. To me, this is as cheap as 'literature' comes. A good love story is driven by plot and [when necessary] padded with sex. This book is the exact opposite. It is just porn without pictures as it would be imagined by a teenager.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|A starship with an improbably disfunctional crew and poorly defined chain of command is sent to a planet to find the creators of humankind. Well, I wish that the premise itself could have been improved upon- the fossil evidence related to human evolution is overwhelming and thus the idea that we are created by advanced humanoids is a bit ridiculous. I think a much better plot device could have been created. Apparently the Engineers were using a  moon of a gas giant as a bioweapons lab and something went wrong and the facility was destroyed by by the bioweapons. Prometheus's crew is entirely disfunctional and different teams have competing , or at leats non-aligned , agendas, dooming the mission from the start, in all reality.(This is another aspect of the plot which requires the suspension of belief on the part of the viewer. ) The Engineers were apparently about to seed Earth with a bio-weapon (which we know of as \\"The Alien\\") to eliminate humankind (I guess we didn't turn out well enough) when their progeny escaped and destroyed their creators. One Engineer is found in stasis by the Prometheus's android and awoken and then he tries to complete his mission and the Prometheus rams the alien spaceship and both are destroyed. It's hard to imagine that a civilization of the Engineers technological level would not have a way to destroy the Prometheus before it hits the alien ship. At the end, the lone human survivor of the Prometheus heads off in another Engineer starship on a searxch for their home planet- could make an interesting sequel, I suppose.<br /><br />While the plot was bit disappointing I liked the production design and how everything more or less fit in with the first Alien movie. For example, the alien we see in the big room in the first movie, sitting in some kind of hgiant chair with its chest burst open, is simply another Engineer which was infected with an Alien and died while trying to launch his craft. The Alien ship is spectacular- you have to wonder about the technology needed to create sush a vessel and you forget for a few moments that it's just a movie. (At least I did.)<br /><br />I give it three stars- it was good but should have been a lot better.

0061743526|5.0|Tom Robinson is accused of a crime he didn't commit and when Atticus Finch is assigned as his defense attorney the lawyer knows he has a difficult task ahead.  Atticus not only has the burden of proving Robinson's innocence, but of convincing a southern jury that they must see past the color of Tom's skin and realize an innocent man is an innocent man even if he is black.<br /><br />This book is an excellent example of well crafted American literature and should be in the library of any bibliophile.  Lee re-creates the feelings and attitudes of many southern states through the eyes of Scout, a female character that has been an inspiration to many girls.  Scout has an interesting perspective on the events of her town as she is both a child and raised by an open minded white-man in a time when being open-minded could get you killed.  Lee's descriptions and dialogue fit perfectly with the mindset of the girl as she grows and we see as unbiased a picture of the town and the people in it as possible to see.<br /><br />Lee's message is still relevant today and while this book has been labeled as one of the \\"classics\\", it is still something we can feel and see today although the prejudices have changed.  If you didn't have the benefit of reading this novel in high school you should pick it up know, to pass on this book is to pass on a piece of American history.
0062197258|4.0|When you read as many books as I do, it becomes almost easy to predict the plot.  On occasion, a truly brilliant author will surprise you with a twist you don't see coming, however this wasn't the case with this book. While Ms. Haynes is a talented author and created a wonderful character study with the heroine and a page-turning novel full of tension, intrigue and suspense, there was nothing that jolted me with surprise.<br /><br />The book was still very good, though. It is a well-written suspense novel, that didn't dissapoint in terms of action, pacing or psychological insight, to both the heroine and the villain.  The only character I felt wasn't highly developed was Stuart. If not for the author trying to create a romance in the book and needing a driver to get the heroine into therapy, Stuart could be edited out and no one would be the wiser.<br /><br />This was definitely worth the read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've just finished the trilogy & loved it. Was very addictive & couldn't put it down. Not only was it hot & steamy 99.9% of the time but also captured what many of us women think & how we react to many of the situations mentioned in the book. I have recommended Fifty Shades to all of my friends. Even if your not into BDSM, this book is still apprealing & will have you blushing & unable to put it down. If you are easily offended probably not the book for you.
145470246X|5.0|I am an intermediate beader and this book is perfect!  The illustrations and written directions are incredibly clear and usually easy to follow--it's unusual to find both clearly written words AND pictures!  The projects themselves are gorgeous.  The two I've done have turned out well.  Only once was I confused (pg 80, #11, second half of the instructions), but I winged it and it turned out nicely. Absolutely gorgeous designs and one of the best, clearest books I've bought (the other is Jamie Eakin's cabochon bead embroidery book). That she is a physician and such a beading expert/designer/author to boot blows my mind.<br /><br />Some of the supplies are a little hard to find, especially larger rivolis in the pretty colors, but most are readily available on the main beading websites. I've used my own color pathways, which are fairly sedate compared to hers, and the results are still wonderful.<br /><br />Thank you to the above reviewer that supplied the bicone size for p49  (3mm).<br /><br />I hope Sabine comes out with more books in the future, because I will buy them!
B006IYFCIM|5.0|All of Ariely's books have been insightful and engaging, but this is his best yet - and by far the most important. Filled with insights guaranteed to impact the behavior of most who read it, it deals with the age-old issue which is impacting our society in increasingly negative ways.  He documents the universality of a willingness to cheat a little bit, while offering concrete steps that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of doing so. Substantive and entertaining.
1439102813|5.0|This novel is superb!  As a psychologist myself, I was drawn to Alice's career and the way the disease erodes at her cognitive abilites.  I read this book knowing little more than a superficial working knowledge of Alzheimer's.  It was wrenching to read how she loses such significant parts of her daily functioning.  There were so many facets that I had never even considered.  I highly recommend this book.  It's one of my top 5 favorite books of all time.

B005LAIHQS|4.0|Ok, my mom and I went to see this movie.  We got there like 5 minutes before it started.  The movie was really cool.  The ending completely changed things.  I can not say what or why.  Just trust me!  There was action and humor in the movie.  However, I didn't feel like there was as much as in the first two.  Same with the music.  I honestly can not remember even hearing music in the film.<br /><br />The first two were cool.  Smiths character was just getting used to what was going on.  Figuring things out.  This movie though is like 15 years after the last.  Seems nothing has changed since the second.  I kind of feel like some stuff should have happened.  I almost felt like I was watching a movie from the 90s that had been made high def and 3D.  I think because I have not seen Jones or Smith in such a long time.  It's like they decided to make a movie, threw a dart at a board and got this.  It was funny.  I will buy it as soon as I can.  I just feel like it was missing something.  I actually think it was because I got there so late.  I felt rushed.  Not sure if that makes a difference.  I am leaning towards yes.<br /><br />I will watch the blu ray and update.  Whenever they release it that is.  I am giving it 4 because the action was great and it had a fun story.  It is something I would and will watch again.<br /><br />update:<br />I realized something about this movie.  Everything seemed to be in the same place.  There was not much moving around.  Nor was there any working up to the story.  In the first two, something would happen.  Then they would go and try to get information on the people or aliens that were causing the trouble.  In this movie, something happened and that was it.  There was no working up.  Everything seemed kind of dull.  It was fun but it just seemed to have been missing a lot of what made the first two so great.

1932100660|5.0|I had heard about this book repeatedly for two years before I read it. Each time I used some excuse to put off looking into it. What got to me was a description of the science behind the claims.<br /><br />I have a Masters degree in science and am a professor at a small Midwestern university so I am constantly deluged with claims about breakthroughs and shocking discoveries. Few of these are based on real science - which I define as science based on studies that have been properly designed and executed and which have been published in recognized peer reviewed journals.<br /><br />The authors of this truly paradigm-shifting work have documented one of the most thoroughly researched breakthroughs in medical science. What the researchers found did not fit in with what they had believed in. It shocked them and they went to great lengths to make sure that their findings could not be erroneous.<br /><br />What they found certainly shocks most people and is very threatening to the trillion dollar agro-food and pharmaceutical/medical industries. Critics who try to nitpick the studies are probably doing so because the discoveries outlined in the book threaten their livelihoods, their employer's profits or their lifestyle.<br /><br />This book is easy to read, difficult to put down and thoroughly complete. My recommendation to everyone I know is \\"do not waste time discussing its implications or what its critics say - just read it and make up your own mind.\\"

0345803485|1.0|Please do not succumb to the hype, as I did, and waste your money on this book (by the way, thanks Amazon for the refund!).  If you have any respect for the written word then you will ask for a refund, too.  The author recycles words (murmur, dryly, wry, holy crap, holy hell, double crap) over and over and over again.  It's nauseating.<br /><br />And the account of Ana losing her virginity?!... I don't even know where to begin. Everyone has a unique experience, sure, but how many people have mind-blowing, pleasure-filled sex with NO PAIN and TWO ORGASMS their FIRST TIME? Yeah, ok. Sure.  And then she comes every single time after that.  Yeah, that's realistic.<br /><br />I do not blame the author, as she is a first-timer, but I blame the editors.  How the hell did this book make it to publishing in this form and HOW IN THE FREAKING WORLD did it become so popular?! It's taking a lot of restraint for me not to send it to Vintage Books covered in red pen edits.<br /><br />Everyone is curious about this book because of all the attention it is getting (I know I was!), but I would suggest that you sit down and read a few chapters at the book store to see if you can tolerate the writing before you waste your money.

B007Q476KU|5.0|Although the story ine is not deep, the photography is the best of the year.  It was an entirely enjoyable experience.  In this day and age we don't realize how important horses were just a few decades ago.  The war horse is truly a hero.and the movie was an eye-opening experience.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|All of the Tom Cruise Mission Impossible movies have been outstanding, and Mission Impossible seems to keep getting better.  Ghost Protocol is the best one of the four.  If you are like me and have multiple devices you like to watch movies from, the two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy is the perfect choice.  The Blu-ray in my HD surround theatre is spectacular.  The HD surround sound and HD picture are second to none on this blu-ray.
0345803485|1.0|I'm seriously ticked off right now. Because a number of my friends are absolutely obsessed with this book, I finally acquiesced and bought the entire trilogy for my Kindle.  It has taken me over a week to get through the first book and I'm just now into the second.  I had to come check the reviews before going on, because I can't believe I am the only person in America who thinks this is the lamest, most annoying least sexy book ever written.  If homeboy tells her to stop biting her lip one more time, I might throw the kindle across the room.  Aside from the ridiculous grammar and editing missteps (that's an understatement) be are expected to suspend disbelief on a level that shouldn't be expected for a book that isn't sci-fi.  This girl is 21 having just graduated college in America and doesn't have an email address or a computer?  She is a virgin but instantaneously orgasms just by breathing the same air as fifty shades, and accepts his extra large manhood multiple times in the same 20 minute time period.  And she not only isn't in pain, or disgustingly uncomfortable, but is constantly primed for more.  Please.<br />I would say, I really want to find out what happens, but if the first book is any indication, my guess is that Ana bites her lip, Gray scolds her, maybe spanks her, she loses her apatite and refuses to eat, he scolds her again, they have sex, and argue, he scolds her and pulls out a foil packet from his pocket.  Can I get a refund for this?<br />For the people who think this is \\"so hot,\\" I'd have to suggest they come back and write a review after A) actually having sex, or B) turning at least 15.<br />Yawwwnnnn.....
B007KDFWRG|4.0|Derek Trucks and the people he surrounds himself with are really live performers. Their studio performances are excellent, but each live performance offers something unique, and is not just a reproduction of a song from an album. I think this is a *little* bit less the case with Susan Tedeschi, but she is also a brilliant live performer.<br /><br />Trucks has always been a proponent of allowing audience members to freely record his performances. With as many high-quality audience recordings of concerts as there are, this album really needed to meet a high standard to justify being sold s a commercial product, and it delivers.  The recording quality is phenomenal. Even if it wasn't, I'd have purchased the album to support some of my favorite musicians, but even casual fans will find this album a worthwhile addition, despite the presence of so many free audience recordings of various shows.<br /><br />I'd give this album five stars, except for a few issues of personal preference. The Tedeschi Trucks Band's musical style is a little narrower than I'd like. The Derek Trucks Band, which seems to be inactive while this band is active, had a much broader musical range, which I found much more fulfilling as a listener (but which doesn't really fit Susan Tedeschi's style). Tedeschi Trucks Band is great, especially for those who love straight blues performances, but I lament the fact that the band doesn't allow Trucks to use and demonstrate the full spectrum of his amazing talent. It also saddens me to see Mike Mattison shuffled into the background. He's a brilliant vocalist, and his addition to the Derek Trucks Band really turned them into a complete band (prior to Mattison, they had various guest vocalists and touring vocalists, but there was no stable voice for the band). Tedeschi has a wonderful voice, too, and as the band's co-leader, it makes sense that she's the primary lead vocalist, but I'd like to see them feature Mattison on lead vocals at least more often than onehalf of one song per concert. For these issues of personal preference, my review comes down to four stars.

0439023513|4.0|I was a little saddened by this book.  Just like Harry Potter, when it ends, it is the end of the story about someone you have come to care about.  But that is how you are supposed to end a series of books.  I forced my Husband to read this one as well, and he came away looking at me with distain in his eyes.  Nothing near tears.  He says that it is good for him to read a girls story, and see just what he is in for with is daughter.  A nutty Girl who can't make up her mind on what she wants.<br /><br />I guess it is a very violent chick book.
0307956350|4.0|This review is from: The Expats: A Novel (Hardcover)<br />I really lost myself in this book. As an expat myself, I enjoyed his close observation of expat life and descriptions of Luxembourg. The story is ripping yarn with first-rate twists and surprises.<br /><br />I'd have given it five stars if the author hadn't gone completely overboard with the time-switch technique. The story jumps around between the past, the distant past, and (in a different font and present tense) \\"today.\\" A little of this goes a long way. As the book went on, this became less suspense-inducing and more just annoying. At one point, after following our heroine from a balcony in the past, to a cafe ten hours later, to the \\"present\\" at another restaurant, and back to the balcony in the past to explain the ten-hours-later cafe, I just got fed up and used post-it notes to re-order my reading to chronological. Which was much more enjoyable anyway.<br /><br />That and a tendency to over-describe were my only quibbles.<br /><br />Nonetheless it's great light entertainment. I hope the author makes a career of this; I'll be looking for more.
0439023521|5.0|I took my daughter to see the movie, and wondered what I was going to be missing in the book.  So I regressed, and read the book.  I made my Hsband read it too.  It is funny how a guy reads a book about a girl.<br /><br /> The heroine is just a young girl, with obviously a lot on her mind.  Life, Death, and two boys.  She has to put on a show in order to stasy alive (literally) and comes out of it with a surprise twist.  Of course you can't read this one without reading the other two.  By the time you are done, you have grown to care about the girl, but she has a lot of other problems that need to be worked out.
B00783NWB6|3.0|I have liked all the underworlds so far, and enjoyed this one too. It took a particularly different angle from the previous movies and strayed away from the original storyline the other 3 shared. This one was more of a vampire vs human movie only with a twist towards the end. It also was much more violet with showing gore than the previous movies which I actually enjoyed. As also owning the Resident Evil 3D, it seems like this movie was made to mirror the same sort of 3D action scenes. I was not too impressed with the 3D in the movie as I felt it wasn't utilized until the last 30 minutes or so of the movie. Until that time I found myself wondering if I should switch it to 2D.<br />Personally, I would have liked to see a better continuation of the previous stories, but the didn't do that. It may have been because the could budget the Michael character into this movie much. I still did enjoy the movie and recommend it to any fan of the previous ones.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+More violence than previous films in the series<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Poor 3D use through much of the movie<br />-Not really a continued story line

1847663796|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moBCJID83PCRJ2]]<br />FOR CROSS-BORDER INSOLVENCY PRACTITIONERS PRIMARILY BASED IN IRELAND<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Informative, lucid and authoritative:  these were among the words of praise heaped on this book when the first edition was published in 1996.  This second edition published recently by Bloomsbury Professional deserves these tributes in equal measure, in fact more so.<br /><br />The authors, Professor Irene Lynch Fannon of University College, Cork, and Gerard Nicholas Murphy, a practitioner at the Bar in that city, are very familiar with the untangling of difficult problems in company law and corporate insolvency in Ireland.<br /><br />Bearing in mind the economic problems which have beset Ireland in recent years, the publication of this new, up-to-date edition of `Corporate Insolvency and Rescue' is timely- especially as Irish law (a constantly developing area) differs in a number of ways from English law on these subjects.<br /><br />Insolvency practitioners in general and those who specialize in cross-border matters in particular will find the differences as well as the similarities fascinating.<br /><br />As Lynch Fannon remarks in the Preface: `The economic crisis into which Ireland was plunged in 2008 led to a renewed interest in insolvency law generally - both personal and corporate; and a great deal of interest in the examinership process in particular...'<br /><br />Certain legislative milestones have ensued as a result, including the enactment of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, (NAMA) the effects of which have impacted on insolvency processes, notably the introduction of a `new' type of statutory receiver.<br /><br />Lynch Fannon also mentions the enactment in 2002 of the EU Insolvency Regulation discussed in detail in the text and is careful to point out that 'Ireland is yet to adopt the UNCITRAL  Model Law on Cross-Border insolvency'.<br /><br />Dealing with the full spectrum of corporate insolvency and rescue, the contents of this accessible and authoritative work of reference covers everything from the context (including some remarks on `Boom and Bust'), to winding up by the court... liquidation... receivership... creditors' claims and remedies... fraudulent and reckless trading and much more besides.  The final 3 chapters cover examinership and other forms of rescue.<br /><br />For ease of use and as an avenue for your further research the book provides extensive and minutely detailed footnoting -- a rich resource in itself, plus a detailed index of over thirty pages.  There are massive tables of cases and legislation and five appendices, including the Rules of the Superior Courts. Usefully, especially in a field of law which impacts internationally, there is a glossary of abbreviations.<br /><br />`Corporate Insolvency and Rescue' is therefore a scholarly, informed and thoughtful source of guidance for anyone practising in this complex area of law.  If you're in any way involved with cross-border insolvency you'll find this book a mine of information and knowledge which offers some interesting perspectives, particularly if you have clients with interests in -- or based in Ireland.  The law is stated as at April 2012.br /><br />Dealing with the full spectrum of corporate insolvency and rescue, the contents of this accessible and authoritative work of reference covers everything from the context (including some remarks on `Boom and Bust'), to winding up by the court... liquidation... receivership... creditors' claims and remedies... fraudulent and reckless trading and much more besides.

1416972242|4.0|(I was given a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to review basis.)<br />This is the second book in the `Mortal Instruments' trilogy, and starts around 1 week after the end of `City of Bones'.<br />Clary is living with Luke, and visiting her mom on a daily basis at the hospital where she is in a coma, and Jace, Isabelle, and Alec are back to hunting demons.<br />Things are different right from the start of this book though, with the return of Maryse Lightwood (Alec and Isobelle's mother) from Alicante. Especially as the first thing she does is kick Jace out; claiming that he must have been spying on them on Valentine's behalf all along. But worse is to come when it seems that Maryse has called in the `Inquisitor' to investigate and punish Jace!<br /><br />Valentine is continuing his mission to get hold of all three mortal instruments, and is this time going after the sword, with a plan to use it for evil.<br />Simon is still in love with Clary, and struggling to get her attention. The faerie queen makes an appearance, we get more of Magnus, and Luke also plays a key role.<br /><br />Once again we are following the shadowhunters as they battle Valentine, and trying to guess what the true relationship between Clary and Jace really is.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book. To be honest I liked it better than `City of Bones'. Right from the start this book grabs hold of your attention and doesn't let it go.<br />First of all there are developments in Clary and Simon's relationship, developments that I didn't think would happen. There's life changing events for Simon too, that bring him more into the limelight and storyline than he was in City of Bones.<br /><br />With regards to poor Jace, he really is in for a rough ride in this book. As if dealing with his adoptive mother kicking him out wasn't bad enough, he has the inquisitor and her harsh ways to deal with, and he gets it pretty bad for things that really aren't his fault. The inquisitors methods are nasty andunfair, and Jace seems to be top of her hit-list. Jace does make some odd choices at times too though, like going to see Valentine randomly, which really is strange.<br /><br />Clary and Jace's relationship is strained to say the least. They're obviously pretty into each other, but with the whole `siblings' thing, it's difficult for either to know where they stand. They can't be together because that would be sickening to other people, but they love each other so much, that can they really ignore their feelings for each other? Obviously the reader is hoping that they can get together and that the familial relationship will be proved to be fake, but at the same time, the idea that they might really be related leaves you with nausea.<br /><br />I personally however will admit that this book just makes me love Jace even more. He's still the same funny, flirty, hero-like character as he was in the first book, and I can't help but want things to work out between him and Clary.<br /><br />As usual the bad guy - Valentine, is winning again, and causing a fair amount of mayhem as he does. His own love for his children is once again proved to fall far short in this book, which can't be very nice for either Jace or Clary, especially when Jace is under the impression that he was abandoned by his own mother.<br /><br />If I had to make one complaint about this book it would be that a certain person just won't die. Whether or not we want him to die is a different question entirely(!), but he seems to have more lives than a cat! In this book he is first killed by vampires, then has his throat slit and his blood drained out, and then meets the dawning sun (which you would expect to kill a vampire). You would think that after all this he would die! But no, he's still hanging in there!<br /><br />The storyline of this book is interesting and full of twists and turns, so much so that writing a summary of what goes on is exceptionally difficult! I did find that it held my attention well, right up until the end where I kind-of got a bit bored during the final fight scene which just seemed to go on and on a bit.<br /><br />Overall this was a great second book though, and I'd recommend it for urban fantasy fans.<br />8 out of 10.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the first book, on to the second!  The story line is excellent! I can believe that story could actually happen in real life!

0345803485|5.0|I usually hate reading, Ive never been able to find a book that captures my attention, but then my friend recommended this book. And I am in love with it. It just keeps getting better and better as you read. I've already ordered the 2nd & 3rd book as well. The only depressing part about this book is that Christian Grey doesn't exist in real life.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I can honestly say that I have never been so attached to a series before. I have rewatched all the episodes, this is the best show that I have ever seen. I hope the Vampire Diaries sticks around for a long time. I love all the characters, especially Elena's character. She brings everything to the show, Nina Dobrev is such a good actress playing Elena and Katherine. I can't wait for season 4 watching for her turn into a vampire is going to be so different and amazing! This show always keeps you interested, new things are always happening. The creators do such an amazing job at reeling you into the show. I am so addicted to this show. I first watched it on netflix, I was such a twilight fan I said this show is going to be a stupid copy of twilight and I dont think I am going to like it, but I was bored so I just clicked on to it, I was hooked from the first minute! It is nothing like Twilight! It is wayyy better, twilight doesn't even come close to The Vampire Diaries. The chemistry between the characters feels so real! That's what I love about this show! Season 3 is amazing!

1401233791|3.0|There are moments that do, yes. I read this storyline issue to issue when I was 14 and loved it. Years later, a lot of it feels pretty silly and dated. Bane is still a cool character, with an interesting history, and Bruce's breaking and recovery are played well, but a lot of this collection drags. The Two-Face two parter? Ugh. I guess someone thought they were writing for Venom and not Dent. There are also bits missing and it's tough to fill in the holes if you don't remember what happened. Croc and Bane? Riddler and Bane? What Jean-Paul's deal was? I couldn't tell you, and this book won't either. But for the most part the strengths outstrip the weaknesses.

0307592731|4.0|Cheryl Strayed was a mess- her mom was dead, she cheated on her husband, and was dabbling in heroin. She had had an abortion, had failed to graduate from college, and was completely disconnected from her family. And then she saw a book on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and decided she needed a change.<br /><br />The Good:<br />- Strayed is honest about her past and about the struggles she faced on the trails in terms of her emotional and physical health.<br />- I didn't know much about long-term backpacking or the PCT and became very interested in both as I read about Strayed's trek<br />- The memoir is well-paced, thoughtfully written, and the writing is decent<br />- I loved the camaraderie between the hikers, even if they were only together a day. People were generous with their advice and at times their food, and there wasn't a sense of competition.<br />- I applaud her effort and ability to finish what she started- the hike was nothing short of hellish, but she managed to finish and learn a lot about herself.<br /><br />Complaints:<br />- I'm not a prude by any means, but there was some really awkward sexual stories and references that I won't discuss in great detail here (you put the honey where?)<br />- As a reader there were times where my sympathy for her wore thin- make better decisions, woman! But, in her defense, this was HER journey.<br /><br />Good, quick read that does a good job combining a personal story with a hardcore natural experience.

B007SSEBCU|1.0|This is a poignant story about an old lady who used to be somebody and is now losing her faculties.  It's touching, but it is not what the viewer needs to know about Prime Minister Thatcher - one of the most powerful and important women of the twentieth century.  If you want a feminist role model for your daughter, try renting a documentary instead.<br /><br />Imagine if Hollywood made a movie about Ronald Reagan that focused on the senile dementia of his twilight years.  The producers are obviously political enemies, indulging in a cheap attack now that Lady Thatcher can no longer defend herself.

B0059XTTW8|1.0|Imagine the CliffsNotes version of a great book; now imagine CliffsNotes of the CliffsNotes, only with errors, insertions, misstatements, and omissions.<br /> This is the highly promoted 2011 movie \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,\\" as loosely as possible based on the novel by John LeCarre.<br /> \\"Tinker\\" is one of the greatest genre novels ever written, and it has had no competition since it was published in the 1970s.<br /> It was later made into a six-hour BBC TV miniseries staring Sir Alec Guinness and about half the members of the Royal Shakespeare Company. That was a television landmark, with superb acting by all, a drama that captured the dark textures of LeCarre's \\"wilderness of mirrors\\" very accurately.<br /> Not so this movie starring Gary Oldman, unfortunately now available on DVD and Blu-ray. Poor Oldman, for his sins, was last seen on the talk-show circuit, trying to salvage with DVD sales what became a theatrical and financial disaster. Here's why.<br /> Admittedly, a two-hour movie has to compress a lot to deal with a 350-page book, but the scriptwriters went beyond compression into revision, and lost the original narrative; they recast characters, inserted meaningless scenes, and did grave damage to the story. This script would have failed as an undergraduate screen-writing exercise.<br /> It is hard to review this film without spoilers, but since I advise you to shun it, here goes.<br /> First, Oldman's portrayal of George Smiley only succeeds when he imitates Guinness's voice and inflection. Otherwise, Oldman is a cigar-store Indian for all the depth he gives the role. While Guinness conveyed a sense of leashed intelligence, suppressed anger, and iron determination, Oldman's portrayal is as flat as a pork chop but less lifelike.<br /> Oldman's Smiley also gets drunk in a newly written scene with Peter Guillam, while Guinness's Smiley hardly touches the stuff. This is an obvious scriptwriter's short cut (\\"Loosen up and spill, George.\\") and undermines the character.<br /> In the novel, the reader was led beside Smiley to the conclusions he drew about the mole in the SIS. This was true of the BBC-TV drama, too; the viewer was allowed to draw the same conclusions as Smiley, because both LeCarre and the BBC played fair with the audience, giving us all the facts as Smiley learned them. Not here.<br /> In the film, when Smiley deduces who the mole is, the scene shows--honest to God!--a light going on. Why not just draw a light-bulb animation above the actor's head? This goes beyond cliché to insult.<br /> The movie Smiley is also less LeCarre's creature of reason and more a man of threat and violence, far more so than in the BBC drama.<br /> For example, to get Toby Esterhase's cooperation, Oldman's Smiley threatens him with deportation to Hungary, where he is said to be a wanted man. He goes so far as to roll an airplane up to him with the implied intention of tossing him aboard and flying him back to Europe (without a parachute?).<br /> In the novel, not only does Esterhase operate at will throughout Eastern Europe, something difficult if your picture is on lampposts and post-office walls, but there is no threat, just a tense discussion between Smiley and Esterhase in which the latter comes to realize that he has been duped. He then spends the next few days in a safe house rather than hoping for a parachute.<br /> Nice visual at the airport though. (By the way, the airplane used in the film had not even been designed in the year the film takes place, but by now, the audience no longer expects believability and is probably nodding off.)<br /> Given the compressed format of a film, you would not expect the insertion of new scenes but here they are.<br /> In one Peter Guillam is shown as having a homosexual relationship that he must end to pursue the mole, breaking down in tears. In the book and BBC drama, Guillam is a tough, robust heterosexual. In another, the mole is shot by one of the protagonists, and the scent ofa relationship is heavy in the air as the two stare into each others' eyes.<br /> The sexuality of the characters is not the issue; the fact that they took up precious time in a compressed format is. Both scenes are gratuitous. There was nothing in either sequence that moved the story line, and in the latter case, the idea of a relationship with the mole casts doubt on the motive of the shooter--was it revenge or was he working for the Russians too? Did he kill the mole to prevent him from saying more before repatriation? This is almost as far from LeCarre as you can get.<br /> Interestingly, when the shooter fires his sniper rifle at the mole, the latter suddenly gets a red beauty mark on his cheek and falls over. In the real world, his head would have exploded, so it's fair to say that this movie can't even get the violence right.<br /> Another added scene shows a Christmas party at the Circus, with much joyous badanage and Santa dressed in a Lenin mask leading the spooks in the Russian national anthem. Not only does this blow away the claustrophobic air of mutual suspicion that LeCarre cultivated in the novel, and which was captured in the BBC miniseries, it's just not in keeping with the story, and nothing remotely like it appeared in the book. Its a simple waste of time.<br /> This damages LeCarre's characters and concept, and does nothing to help the film which, by this time, has become a cinematic sleeping pill.<br /> There are other insults to LeCarre's original, but I'll spare you most of them.<br /> Karla appears in the first few minutes of the film, taking active part in the capture of Jim Prideaux. Not in the novel; for reasons important to the plot, Karla isn't introduced until late in the book and the Prideaux capture is very different than in the movie (though the movie version was a lot cheaper to shoot), and Karla is in Russia when it takes place. Thus, even the character of Karla is downgraded from the original.<br /> The character of Lacon is notLeCarre's petulant, arrogant, semi-competent bureaucrat. Ricki Tarr is a far different man who operates much differently, at the expense of the story line. Gilliam's penetration of the Circus' file system is easier than in the book or the BBC drama; indeed the SIS looks asleep as Gilliam laughably steals the crown jewels.<br /> Nor were the producers big on logic. In the film, a woman is shot in Prideaux's cell during his KGB interrogation. For this to have happened, you have to twist time because the woman had a relationship with Tarr after Prideaux returned to England. How dumb did the scriptwriter think we are? Or was he making a subtle case for time travel?<br /> This scene is new too. It never appeared in the book and works as well as a can tied to a dog's tail.<br /> There is another unintentionally comic scene in the Circus in which people sit reading top-hush documents at the rim of a long desk built around a huge hole though which the floors below are visible. One can only imagine the panic as one of them accidentally drops a Most-Secret document into the unclassified depths below.<br /> Finally, the editing seems to have been done by a film student. If you compare the credits with the characters actually shown, a significant number of people died on the cutting room floor, making this one of the few movies I've seen with a significant body count.<br /> In effect, the producers of this film took a hammer to a diamond. If you want an on-screen experience even remotely like the book, find the BBC-TV version; it is superior in every way. Better yet, buy the novel.<br /> Justifiably, the film only drew about $20 million at the box office, and I'll bet many in the audience woke up to the credit roll, then asked for their money back. In contrast, a successful summer movie earns two or three times that much the first weekend.<br />So, Stinker was that bad. No fear of a sequel, thank heaven.<br /> I hope LeCarre got paid in advance; if not, he should charge everyone involved with vandalism.<br /> NB: Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called this \\"Easily one of the year's best pictures,\\" which says more about the critic than the movie.
1613822650|5.0|This is one of those classics that I put off reading for years, and years, and years. Finally got around to reading it last month. Slow going at first, but after getting a \\"feel\\" for the characters and the writing style of Wilkie Collins, I became hooked. It's long, at 500-plus pages, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable. Lots of suspense, a colorful cast of characters, and a very delightful --- and occasionally wicked --- sense of humor on the part of the author. For something written in the 1860s, this novel has remarkable staying power. The methodical pace and multiple narratives will certainly be jarring for anyone raised on the current crop of contemporary thrillers, but if you enjoy a good mystery with plenty of fascinating characters, you should not miss this one.
B0086700CM|5.0|at first they only had temple run on iphone and ipad.  then they finnaly reallesed the game to kindles I was siked.
B0086700CM|3.0|I liked the game, but after a week of playing it, it seemed boring and repetitive. After playing during a 4 hour car trip I had enough coins saved up to unlock 2 characters, I was really disappointed to see that the character's skill level didn't change at all. If you're.going to spend 25,000 coins to unlock a character they should at least be able to run faster or jump higher.

B001I7MBLA|5.0|My kids LOVE this book.  This was our second copy, they wore out the first one.  I got tired of taping it back together.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is super duty, very thick and heavy. Super for camping I think not very practical for anything else. It is simply too big.
B005NPLXJ4|2.0|When I heard about this album, I was very excited about it.  I used to own all of Metallica's albums up through the Black Album, but my tastes had changed in the 90's and I stopped keeping up with them.  That said, I had recently been getting back into Metallica and it seemed this album was perfectly timed.  After reading about the album, I was even more exited since this album sounded very different and innovative, and I like Reed's song \\"Perfect Day\\" and thought the collaboration might work well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I had not been keeping up with Lou Reed either and didn't realize that his voice had turned into a bag of gravel.  At times Lou Reed sings over Metallica's instrumental performance on Lulu and at times he just reads the lyrics; his reading is substantial better than his singing which is truly bad.  When I first heard his voice on this album, I was reminded of the voice of Marvel Comic's Stan Lee and was wholly expecting him to exclaim \\"Excelsior!\\" at any point.  Actually, that is probably a bit unfair ... to Stan Lee: his voice is much better.<br /><br />Lou Reed's voice is the main reason I gave this album such a bad rating.  It makes this album unlistenable.  Any single person with a decent voice would have been better, and I cannot understand why in the world they didn't get someone else to sing or read his parts.<br /><br />I'm sure many people having listened to the album will take issue with my review at this point because I liked the album otherwise.<br /><br />The instrumental parts are vintage Metallica and they rock as I expected them to.  Sometimes the songs would begin with a string quartet and metamorphosize into Metallica's dark metal rock.  This could have been done very poorly, but it wasn't.  The transition is very cool and not heavy-handed.<br /><br />The lyrics are really weird and they are off-putting when you listen to them at first.  That said, some of them are really inspired and the more you \\"read\\" them, the more you can see what Lou Reed was going for.  The album is based upon Frank Wedekind's 2 plays that make up \\"Lulu,\\" and it actually reminds me of Phillip Glass' \\"Hydrogen Jukebox\\" with Allen Ginsberg reading his works over Glass' music [[ASIN:B002LA8QHQ Hydrogen Jukebox]].  That album isn't for everyone and neither is Lulu.  Unfortunately, Reed's voice prevents this album from being for me as well.<br /><br />Overall, however, I have to praise Metallica for making this album because it is new, different, inspired, and made me respect them as artists even more.

1594484805|1.0|There's an old con game whereby the perpetrators claim to be expert at picking stocks. They send a million letters worldwide to prospective \\"clients\\" indicating a future hot stock. Their claim piques interest by asking recipients to track the inevitable rise of their pick at no obligation of course. When the stock does indeed take off it entices a certain percentage of letter holders. The trick is all the letters aren't the same as there are different stock picks on different letters. The law of averages dictate a certain percentage of letters will indicate good picks and some of those letter holders will be enticed to sign over their life savings.<br /><br />Dan Pink uses a variation of this with his Wikipedia analogy. The Wiki model attracts a select group of enthusiasts pooled from a large worldwide audience. Wiki volunteers contribute at their leisure with just a small percentage contributing on a consistent basis. Wikipedia outgunned MS Encarta because pulling in volunteers, even momentarily, from a vast worldwide pool is very powerful due to the law of averages. But applying this to a limited pool of employees who expect to get paid, as Mr. Pink does for writing books and giving lectures, is folly. I'm quite sure most Wikipedia volunteers are supported by \\"real jobs\\" which enable them to spend time contributing.<br /><br />The Dan Pink's of the world, like the aforementioned stock pickers, never create success in the field they are supposedly expert in. Instead their success is derived from revenue gained from drawing people into their colorful, baseless opinions. CEOs and top managers are always looking for ways to make their mark by impressing their bosses or board members. This is especially prevalent when the economy is slow and ideas are in short supply, so they \\"buy brains\\" from clever sounding individuals.<br /><br />The truth is Top Managers would improve their company processes by attaining and utilizing honest feedback from their employees. Not as easy as it sounds but vastly worthwhile nonetheless.<br /><br />If you're curious, rather than waste your money on the book look up Dan Pink in Tedtalks.comsy as it sounds but vastly worthwhile nonetheless.<br /><br />If you're curious, rather than waste your money on the book look up Dan Pink in Tedtalks.com

B00881VLCE|1.0|This app was ridiculous!!! It put a virus on my kindle!! (I have a anti-virus app) This app made it detect 5 VIRUSES!!! So of course, I was stupid and ignored it. So, 2 weeks later, My Kindle Fire Shut down on me and it wouldnt turn on for 2 days!!! If you have an anti-virus app like I do, (it would be smart to get one) Do not get this app. It most likely will detect a virus.
B007N8RULO|4.0|great app! tons of fun! the ads are quite annoying and usually are videos. they're hard to skip over. other than that, I have no complaints. its really east to use and keeps you busy for hours.

B0088RQ4X4|3.0|I made the mistake of reading the book before seeing the movie so I was hoping it would be closer.  However, if you haven't read the book yet, then you shouldn't be disappointed.  Overall, it was a good, fun story with a satisfying (actually better than the book) ending.  It would be worth reading the book after seeing the movie as it will be easier to visualize the characters that were beyond my imagination when I read the book.  I'm not sure why the movie didn't do better in the theaters as it is no worse than \\"Star Wars\\" as far as fantasy goes.  Actually, the dialog was much better than \\"Star Wars\\" which to me is like watching high school drama class.
B0086700CM|3.0|I would have given the game five stars being that I have it on my iphone but the game lags and freezes too much on the kindle fire. If it persists I will be deleting it. Other than that the game rocks!!!
B007V2UGPE|2.0|The graphics are good and all, but the game play isn't. All you do is move side to side, you don't  even get to attack. There is one manual attack button, but its limited.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its actually really fun to play because there's more then one game you should try it if yu haven't.  you'll like it! &amp;&amp; its free
B001CTDH76|5.0|I asked for this product for Mother's Day!  It is so great! I love the characters, especially Kimball Cho's \\"Joe Friday\\" take on his character.  But actually, I love them all, not just Patrick Jane. My kids think there is too much Red John stuff, but I disagree; I like especially the stories in which Patrick uses skills to make money, and then give it away -- quite redemptive really... almost as good as revenge!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is the best book i have read all year. I can't believe it only cost $1:50. I also can't believe it was self published. I didn't notice any mistakes although i wasn't actually looking for them. I was skeptical at first about all the 5 star reviews but now i can understand the hype.

0061726834|5.0|Lena's voice is real and beautiful. Her happiness, sorrows, and troubles all flow through the pages, and they touch my heart every time I read this book. It is easy to relate to Lena. She starts as a good girl who wants to follow the rules and doesn't want trouble. Having seen what happened to her mom, she can't wait for her procedure, so she'll never have to worry again about the possibility of falling to the disease of love. Maybe she could have had a \\"happily ever after\\" like her sister; maybe she would have lived a loveless life. But then she meets Alex.<br /><br />Alex. The intelligent girl that she is, Lena knows from the beginning that there is something up with Alex, but she can't help meeting with him again and again. Words can't describe the beauty of their relationship except that they were meant to be. Looking back at this book, I can only describe the magic of their relationship as the magic of first love. It is a magic that we all want to see last, but a magic that we know extinguishes all too often.<br /><br />Delirium is a book about love. It is about faith and courage in opening yourself to pain and sorrow at the same time that you discover the blessing that is love. Lena lives in a rigid society with many strict rules and beliefs. Reading Delirium as a story is an experience in itself, but I can't help comparing Lena's life to my own. When I read this book, I am thankful that we have no laws against love, that we have the freedom of creativity and independence. And I cheer on Lena, wishing her all the best in her pursuit of love.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver is an amazing writer. You should read all of her books. Even though she plays with our hearts and leaves us with cliffhangers, it is well worth the experience. I have no idea what we'll have coming to us in book three, but I have high expectations for it. Once you own all three Delirium books, you should reread the entire trilogy in full. I know that I will!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|sequel please. do better marketing than a high school class and you will make much more money.  don't hesitate to purchase, it is an enjoyable, beautiful ride.
0345803507|5.0|After starting Book Two of the 50 Shades Trilogy a good story line had developed and reading Book Three was a must!!  I immediately ordered Book Three which was a \\"must have\\" by this time.  Amazon got the book to me quickly and I was able to continue on with the story.  The books get nothing but better and definately make good reading.  I would definately recommend ordering all Three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Cliched, boring and slow. They didnt show the real ending until after the credits, which I had to find out about from a friend because I shut if off as soon as the screen went black. If you watched the preview, you saw everything you need to know. Superhuman wolves that somehow were always there at every turn. I guess they were an allegory for death but even then it was a shallow allegory. Be productive with your time and dont watch this movie!
159448385X|5.0|This book explores what it means to be a woman in Afghanistan, and focuses on the lives of two characters, Mariam and Laila. The heart, the compassion, the understanding, and the love with which these women were painted--especially Mariam--led me to believe at first that the author was female. Perhaps it is my own narrow-mindedness, but I doubted that a man could ever have such a touching perspective on women's experience. I'm glad to be wrong about this.<br /><br />I've read many many books in my life, but not often do I come across a book where the characters absolutely infiltrate my consciousness to the extent that Mariam, Laila, Tariq, and Hakim did. Especially Mariam. I felt her shadow all around me as I read this book, and I cannot forget her. This novel has made the experience of Afghani women stark and immediate; if that was the author's intent, he succeeded mightily.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is definitely a guilty pleasure, fun to read on your time off. The first book is the best of the three because we get the beginning of the romance and the sexual aspects still hold their surprise element. The other two are still good though ;) It's not advanced reading, doesn't really make you think, it's just a good ole trashy novel.
B004S49YEM|4.0|A good story - but don't think too much about it as you'll spot the holes and the ending.<br />Well written, it draws you in. If this was his first novel I will definitely go on to read more by this author. But not a five star read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|definitely recommend. Like all the options.  A fun game for all ages. start playing today! what qre you waiting for?
0345803493|5.0|The first book of the Trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey was a gift but as soon as I finished with it I wanted to read the second book so ordered Fifty Shades Darker: Book Two of the Fifty Shades. It was quick in arriving and was all I was hoping for. Even better than Book One of the Trilogy.
B00881VLCE|5.0|it works very good in the kindle fire and the puzzles are very cute. their are a variety of puzzles to choose and their are some that u can buy. I recommend this app for people that want to pass time and love puzzles.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Literature must be getting desperate for a publisher to print this book, let alone a triology.<br /><br />Without all the porn, it would be a \\"cute\\" read for women. As it is most readers never finish reading it.

B00846TTDG|1.0|I am an avid Action movie watcher. I went into this film with low expectations because I realized the<br />Navy SEALS are not actors, they are warriors. I did expect the action sequences to be a bit more interesting...<br />Honestly it just looked like a dumb, scripted, B movie. I could have dealt with the bad acting but<br />I was interested in seeing a bit of the well oiled machine that is the US Navy SEALS here and that<br />did not happen. This one isn't even worth the price of the rental, just watch the trailer again.
B0002EXH4A|4.0|The previous Megadeth album to this, \\"Peace Sells\\" showed the band showing their songwriting skills and musicianship. \\"So Far\\" has a new line-up but the band sounds just as good and Dave Mustaine found a comfortable way of singing that sounds great for metal. The downside of this record is that it is way too short (only 8 songs).<br /><br />In addition to that, on 2 of the songs, you can tell that Dave is blatantly wasted on something and doesn't deliver 100 percent but just enough that the song is still decent (\\"502\\" comes to mind). The instrumental that starts off the album is really good but I'm not sure it quite fits on an album this short. Finally, no cover of the original \\"Anarchy of the UK\\" will ever surpass the original Sex Pistols version, but I must admit that Megadeth did a decent metal version (with Steve Jones on the track to boot). As decent as it was though, it makes this album feel even more like a collection of songs as opposed to a body of work that flows.<br /><br />There are some REALLY excellent Megadeth classics on this record though and I've gotta say that this album may be one of the angriest I've ever heard Dave Mustaine on. He does that growl/sing thing but at times he actually is screaming and sounds pretty mad.<br /><br />Bottom line, this was probably one of the most conflicted times of Dave Mustaine's life with his drug problems, Cliff Burton dying, and his own inner demons that you clearly hear him sing about and at times ask for someone to save/help him. It may not be Megadeth's most focused or best album, but it has classic tracks that should NOT be overlooked.<br /><br />If you're an old Megadeth fan, revisit this if you skipped over it.<br />If you're new to Megadeth, start with \\"Rust in Peace\\" or \\"Countdown to Extinction\\".

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Since the very first teaser was released, even before realizing this movie had anything to do with Alien, I couldn't wait to see it. I'm glad to say the wait was totally worth it; for such a long film, there wasn't a single dull moment. I don't understand how anyone, especially fans of Alien, could dislike Prometheus. With an engaging setting, memorable characters, and moments that leave you wondering what will happen next, it's a marvelous movie that holds its own against other sci-fi greats.<br /><br />Prior to watching Prometheus I had never seen the Alien films, but immediately afterwards I proceeded to watch Alien, Aliens, and Alien 3 back-to-back. Let me tell you, having the chance to see the prequel first made watching this trio that much more enjoyable for me.<br /><br />I truly hope this film gets the sequel(s) it deserves; I will definitely be catching it in RealD at least once more before it leaves theaters and can't wait for the 3D Blu-ray release.

0307959856|1.0|This book is so uneven and, ultimately, very disappointing.  There are so many Austen pastiches written, most around the characters from Pride and Prejudice, and most are far better than this.<br /><br />James succeeds in her presentation of the social humor of how small town society operates and in the absurdities of character, such as in the condolence letters of Lady Catherine and Mr. Collins.<br /><br />However, the basic story is boring and poorly constructed and the characters unlikable.<br /><br />It is clear when Elizabeth and Georgina Darcy visit the cottage in the woods that Louisa is lactating from the milk on the front of her dress and is thus the mother and not the aunt of the baby, and as his name is Georgie, possibly Wickham's son, making this baby the center of how and why the murder occurred.<br /><br />It is all a convoluted mess, and bringing in the names of characters from Emma and Persuasion is insulting to the reader.<br /><br />The reader can only hope that now in the New World, the Wickhams will stay there as if Lydia was an obnoxious brat as a teenager, as an adult she is a shrieking harpy. Virginia, watch out.<br /><br />This reader also hopes that James will return to her own world for future books and leave Austen's alone.

B0073Q0DZG|5.0|Three great actors, fresh subject matter (what other movie plot features a birding competition?), and touching sub-plots make this movie a winner.  I even managed to learn a bit about birds!  Great wholesome movie.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|This book was very intense and sort of difficult to follow at times.  My book club \\"took it on\\" and everyone in attendance really, really seemed to enjoy the author's first novel, so hard to believe that it was Diane Setterfield's first one!  It had many of the elements required to make a great novel and Setterfield used most of the elements needed for some great writing. I'm so glad I read it.  I don't usually want to read a book again, but for many of my friends, myself included, this one is very tempting to reread as it will all fall into place and be much clearer the second time around!!!
B000UBMSB8|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ridley Scott in an overrated hack. Terrible score. Awful set design. Horrible script. Dull acting. Had the feel of a student film. I didn't like it at all. Just my opinion. Sorry if that offends some people. I purchased this movie based on Alien and the cult following it has.  This is my opinion. Deal with it, nerds.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I read these 4 books many years ago, but watching the series on HBO has made me want to revisit them. It is interesting to see not only the differences between the book and tv version, but the differences between when I thought some events happened, and when they actually were done in the novels.This is an exciting series to read!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The book is mostly entertaining but I can't help but feel like I'm reading Twilight with a BDSM twist. I do enjoy some of the banter between the two.

145210655X|5.0|Really not much to say.  This book was definitely not wasted money.  Think Calvin & Hobbes meets MAD Magazine and you wouldn't be far off.<br /><br />The interior art/painting was amazing!  My only complaint is that the book was far too short.  I think I read it in about 15 minutes.  And, that includes examining and relishing the artwork!<br /><br />Oh, and read it with a grain of salt if you are a true Star Wars fanboy (like me).  When certain events occur in the Star Wars Universe and how old the characters should be doesn't match up.  This is not a complaint on my part, but you know some fanboy will complain about this vehemently.  So, now you are forewarned.  ;-)<br /><br />If you are even just a slight fan of Star Wars or just love fresh and great humor then get this book.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Really enjoyed this entry in the MiB series. Although it didn't seem like there were as many aliens in this installment as in the previous two, an alien (who I honestly thought was voiced by Tim Curry) escapes from a moon-based prison, gets to Earth, goes into the past, and kills Agent K. Fortunately Agent J still remembers the time he'd spent with his partner and finds a way to go to the past to try to save him. Oh yeah, and the rest of the planet too.<br /><br />There is some fun action in this movie, but it is mostly a character story that develops the relationship between J and K. Josh Brolin does a great take on the young Agent K. The interactions between Will Smith, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones made this a good time that flew by.<br /><br />Well-written, well-acted, and deserving of a place on your video shelf next to the original [[ASIN:B0011E9LBI Men In Black]]. (Assuming you knew enough to avoid [[ASIN:B0049IHX2C Men in Black II]].)

B00846TRHY|5.0|My mind is still spinning with all the elements of this film. Phenomenal story, action, direction in the little details and Gerard's performance was top notch.of course some things were exaggerated, but the most gut wrenching details are things that actually happen to the children of the Sudan. Despite any controversy Sam may be facing, this film stands on its own and stands tall.<br /><br />The films portrayal of coming back to the states after seeing the horrors of humanitarian work is all too real. Myself and many of my friends have felt the same way and for those emotions played out by Gerard, we're spot on.<br /><br />I, and many of my friends would have seen this in theaters but for some reason, it was apparently abandoned by Relativity due to lack of interest.  It pains me to think that films that are display this passionate faith, done by top notch actors and film makers could just fall by the way side. I hope that outside the theater, this films lives on and finds it audience.<br /><br />These are the types of movies I love to see. Let's make sure this is not the last of its kind. I refuse to believe the studio should lose 28 million on such a phenomenal piece of culture, character, passion and art.

B00127RAJY|2.0|I have a collection of over 70 workout DVD's and I have to say that Jillian's (I have two of her workouts) are among my least favorites. There is something about her attitude that is counter-motivational to me and I don't like the sequencing of the sets/moves/repetitions. I do low impact aeorobics with over 60 pounds strapped to my body (hips, back, ankles and wrists) but prefer to do hard cardio with little or no weight. I also really like compound resistance training where more that one muscle group is engaged and one can easily add to the challenge by adding incremental weight increases for specific muscle groups. This is impossible to do with Jillian's workouts because of the the short segments for cardio and resistance. There simply is no time to adjust weights. I also wonder what her training and background are because she doesn't focus on safety and form. An example: when she cues for Jumping Jacks, her commentary is 'I'm not going to give you any modifications--if 400 hundred pound people can do this, so can you'. She completely ignores any health issues that would make a high impact, intense cardio exercise like Jumping Jacks unwise for someone--such as joint problems, back problems, heart problems, etc. No properly trained trainer would suggest that Jumping Jacks are appropriate for everyone at any level of fitness.

B00846TTDG|5.0|who cares what the acting is like!  These guys are the real deal and this is one great movie.  Good Plot and lots of action from real heros.  The folks putting down this movie are probably the same who agree with the crappy art camp flicks that the Oscars deem as good.  This is pure fun i am going to buy it!!!!!!
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|Bought Trespassing, Adam Lamberts latest CD from Amazon, after only hearing one song. Love the whole CD, if you like Adam you should love this. It is somewhat different from his last CD but in a good way. He changes things up a little, but still has the great songs and voice. Gets me dancing and I am 50.

B007C4B2CC|5.0|If you've seen the movie then forget most of it when you begin this book.  Though books do go into much more detail than movies can or allowed to, this is very well the case here.  Every other chapter or so touches on what I had already seen in the movie, so I quickly determined to focus solely on the book, and what a fine, intense, intriguing read it is.  Very well written, very detailed, and difficult to put down until you reach the end of a chapter.  I fully intend to purchase the rest of this series.  The movie does it justice, but just barely.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|You simply must read this book. Goddam.<br /><br />While I am perhaps coming on a bit strong, John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces, protagonised by Ignatius Reilly, is not a book that lends itself to qualified (in the syntactic sense) or in any way guarded statements. I thus feel it appropriate to proclaim that the text is a work of genius and ought to be added as the fourth \\"r\\" to the general education method (\\"reading, `riting, `rithmetic\\"), and, if four r's are deemed too many, I feel it ought to replace writing. Indeed, all that there is to be learnt of good writing can be learnt in this book.<br /><br />If you thought Napoleon Dyamite was original in that it had virtually no plot, merely inane characters, you will think again once you read this book. If you thought that Snatch, Go or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels displayed a brilliant mastery of the plot twist, you may think again once you finish the book's ultimate chapter. If you thought the first thing you would save in a housefire was your pet, marriage photos, or loved ones, you may think again once you own a copy of A Confederacy of Dunces.<br /><br />I encourage you to get a copy. I encourage you to read it. I further encourage you to adopt the contrived and rather absurd argot of the fat, garish, arrogant and boorish protagonist Ignatius Reilly. In the canon of literature there are many remarkable characters. In my own reading I remember empathising with Goethe's Werther, adventuring with Heller's Yossarian, and trudging alongside Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s Billy Pilgrim. But none of these characters can hold a candle to Ignatius Reilly. I have delved in to Anna Karenina's life, I have laughed at Ford Prefect's absurdities, I have recoiled at Alex's ultra-violence. But none of these characters is as memorable as Ignatius Reilly. Humbert Humbert has charmed and appalled me, Jem Finch has impressed me, and Napoleon the boar has somewhat offended my sense of justice. But none of these characters hashad quite the effect of Ignatius Reilly. Indeed, I suspect I will continue to read throughout my life, hopefully eventually polishing off the works of Dickens (who, I understand, is quite the characteriser), and never encounter a character that is as superlative as Ignatius Reilly.<br /><br />Read the goddam book.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Overall good movie with moments you can do without. Must see Thor to completely understand how the movie got here.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I couldn't put it down! I took my Kindle everywhere because I was hooked!
080214473X|5.0|For some reason I waited 15 years to read this, long after Bill Clinton, Aideed, and Somalia were long forgotten.  I saw the movie but did not know what an important book this was. The movie was a realistic action story, along the lines of Superman meets the Skinnies, albeit with a lot more trauma than we see in the Sunday funnies.<br /><br />Mark Bowden is a fellow Philadelphian, well known for his features at the old Inquirer.  Here he writes the comprehensive story of one day in 1993 when the US Army was in a place they should not have been, doing something best left for others, directly in the line of fire of centuries old clan warfare.  The Army group sets out on a one hour mission to capture some Somalian bad guys, not the leader, but his lieutenants. It goes wrong nearly from the git-go when the first man out of the helicopter falls 70 feet to the street. Next thing we have a firefight with the US and the locals. Unfortunately we got into this thing without a backup plan, enough vehicles, water, and a decent map. As the title makes clear, Somalians had RPG's on hand which are very good at killing helicopters if you can get under one.  On this day they shot down two and did no end of damage to other helicopters and trucks.<br /><br />Where Bowden's book is unique is that he is the only one telling the story of the next 24 hours from every possible point of view. He interviewed all our people but also the Skinnies.  That took a lot of hallucinogenic drugs and a devil's pact with the local travel agent, but Bowden went back to Somalia and talked to surviving local combatants.<br /><br />Clinton was new to the Presidency in 1993 but had the political skills to know when to cut and run. He made the decision that week to get everyone out of Somalia quickly. Even the UN realized that when you are in the middle of a civil war in a country with no resources, no leadership, and no money, and they are killing the peacekeepers, it is time to find another location.<br /><br />Bowden took the time to develop unprecedented access to soldiers and their families.  We hear heart-breaking stories of army families asking why we got involved in Somalia.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|The last two books I read of this 'genre' (micro entrepreneur  or personal branding/career books) were disappointments, and when I purchased this one I immediately regretted it 'they' got you again' I told myself. Another book that makes promises and doesn't deliver. But a funny thing happened, this one did deliver.<br /><br />Chris's book is a practical no-nonsense guide for starting up a micro-business, with a focus on internet based businesses. He provides plenty of examples, instructional stories and tips, along with practical nuts and bolts advice. Lastly, it is refreshingly free of cross-selling/referencing. Nor is it filled with platitudes - one of my favorite parts of the book is delineating between your 'passion' and what you can actually to for a living.  A great example he uses is a guy who goes to different countries an learns languages - he is not paid for this, but rather, showing people how to learn languages quickly. It's a subtle but important distinction. Not everyone who tries will succeed, not everyone who reads this book will even try, but there's enough information and inspiration here for anyone to get started.
B0013F1D02|5.0|What an entertaining movie, Stardust, is; fantastic acting with a truly all around great cast (including surprising success with Cox and Danes), the landscapes where the movie was filmed are breath-taking and the special effects are fun and add to the whimsy of the film...including the ghosts!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I love this show and I am definitely going to buy this DVD when I get the money. I am sad that there is no Blu Ray release out though.

That is my only complaint. Other then that I hope this has many many more seasons to come. Also can't wait for episode three to come on this Monday. YAY!

055357342X|5.0|Words can't describe how awesome and amazing this book is. The character development is superb, and the surprises keep on coming and coming. By the middle of the book, you think you already mapped out what's going to happen to these characters, but then - BAM! - something huge happens and changes the course of their destiny.<br /><br />Without a doubt, A Storm of Swords is the best in the ASOIAF series. It is the thickest and longest book, but the excitement and controversies surrounding the plotlines keep you on the edge of your seats as you flip the pages and read as fast as you can so you will know what happens next. I also love the fact the characters are somewhat get connected with each other. Some people you never thought to be together in one room will meet.<br /><br />All of the characters, especially the POV characters, have decisions they always have to face. One wrong move can affect them and the people around them, one right move can dictate their future.<br /><br />Some major mysteries were also answered in A Storm of Swords. Who really asked the lowborn man to kill Bran in his sleep back in Book 1? Who really killed Jon Arryn? Who is Ser Dontos' boss in the whole Sansa-must-escape thing?<br /><br />My favorite characters are Tyrion and Sansa. I love how their lives change in an instant after *spoiler alert* their marriage. But if you think you already know what's going to happen in their chapters, Joffrey's wedding with Margaery changes it all. Sansa has the last chapter in the book (not including the confusing and chocking epilogue). In my opinion, that Sansa chapter is one of the best in the whole series. The melodramatic beginning and fun middle part, ends with a surprising twist.<br /><br />Furthermore, George RR Martin did a killing spree in his third book. There are a lot of character deaths throughout. Some unexpected, some predictable, some oh-so satisfying.<br /><br />Now for the book itself. As I said above, this is the thickest and longest book so far. Although it has 1125+ pages, you will be mesmerized how fast-paced the events were. However, the font of the letters are undeniably smaller than the previous and the recent books. Nevertheless, you'll get used to it by page 50 or so.<br /><br />As my conclusion: 5 STARS! Perfect. Wow, just wow.ook so far. Although it has 1125+ pages, you will be mesmerized how fast-paced the events were.

B007ZGIPAO|4.0|I like this app. The tiles have simple but innovative Olympic-related designs. There are three levels of difficulty although all are quite easy. The only drawback I've experienced is that it usually takes several attempts to get the tiles to recognize that I'm tapping them. I know that the Kindle Fire is not as sensitive to light tapping as most of the similar products on the market - this was verified by Amazon's Kindle customer service. Even though I tap with adequate force the tiles require multiple taps. I don't care about the timing feature of the app so I know that I'm not skimming haphazardly over the tiles. Other than this somewhat annoying issue I recommend the app to mahjong players.

0439023521|4.0|Given the difference in marketing between a major-house featured product and most other books (including my own The Rescuer's Path, a small-press novel also concerning two very young fugitives in the wilderness in a dyfunctional society), I was prepared to be disappointed by the so-hyped Hunger Games. To my surprise, however, this is, at least in its second half, a first-rate book that uses highly sophisticated writing technique to juggle the threads of half a dozen plot-lines through a magnificently orchestrated climactic battle with the \\"wolves\\" and competing players (i.e., teenage children) and then through the challenge against the Capitol's game-controllers, and THEN in the intimate human interplay between young Katniss and the man who loves her. Very well handled, elegant writing in, especially, the last fifty pages carries this well beyond the \\"YA\\" corral and into serious literature.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am a video workout buff and own several DVDs. I had used a lot of the beach body DVDs and had lost a lot of weight, but could not keep it off. I tried 30 day shred based on reviews and have to give it full marks. The best thing about this DVD is the time: 2o mins. I am inpatient and get easily bored, so I have a TV show on and play this DVD on my laptop to get through it. I like the intensity and fast pace and of course its a killer workout. I live in a second floor apt and I use the Sears exercise cushions to do my jumping jacks. Luckily no one has complained so far. I am on early week 2 and I am sweated and fizzled out by the end of the wo. My hunger is also getting curbed and I am not eating as much.
B007MDB71O|3.0|This movie had real potential.  The acting was acceptable and some of it was quite good. The action and special effects were not too bad either.<br /><br />And surprisingly modifications to the original 1917 book were not bad at all.  I even thought the ending of the movie was much better than the book's ending.  The way he actually gets to Mars makes much more sense in the movie versus the book.  The movie's plot is actually improved in my opinion.<br /><br />So what happened??  Why was this a bomb?  Well...<br /><br />The problem I had with this movie was that certain things happened that made no sense... there were \\"jumps\\" in logic so to speak.  It was as if important parts of the movie were CUT OUT.<br /><br />For example, Carter says to Tars that he knows Sola is his daughter.  Now... no way could one gather that from what we saw in the movie.  Sola's character is hardly a part of the movie.  There is almost no character development there and we hardly know who Sola is.  In the book Sola is a main character... the book builds her up as being someone different from the rest of the Tharks. In the movie she hardly exists.  They should have either made more of her character or cut her out completely for brevity's sake.<br /><br />And that was the case for a number of the characters. They weren't developed enough for us to really 'like' or know them.<br /><br />That is a big problem in scifi movies, you focus so much on the special effects you lose out to character development and a smooth plot.

0439023491|4.0|In some respects I enjoyed this one better than the original. The new twist on the games was fantastic, but I appreciated that it took up less of the book, since it's the out-of-the-arena conflicts, both in Katniss's personal life and the political tensions in the Districts, that are particularly gripping. Collins's does a fabulous job with character development, and Katniss is a tour de force of a realistic, compelling, flawed heroine.
0545091020|2.0|The trilogy is amazing; no question. As an adult reader, I'm sure I take different things from it than my kids did when they read it. I'm sure when they re-read it in 10 years, it'll be a completely new experience for them. I'm also sure that if it isn't taught in high school and college yet, it soon will be. It is definitely one of my all-time favorite books!<br />That said, the audiobook is jarringly bad. The narrator is a well-educated middle-aged woman with a hyper-enunciated accent. She doesn't for a minute sound like a semi-feral Appalachian teenager. I was so glad I'd read the book before listening to the audiobook - my take on the story would have been completely different, listening to Katniss narrate in a Capitol accent.<br />It's a pity - my family loves audiobooks on long car drives, and I was really excited that the Hunger Games trilogy would give us a break from Harry Potter and Neil Gaiman - arguably the best family audiobooks out there!
0307957934|5.0|THE FEAR INDEX (2011) is a current-day SciFi action-adventure, about an highly-evolved online trading artificial intelligence (computer program), that has uncannily advanced abilities, allowing it to make trillions in the stock market, and to be able to insure its own existence by ordering the creation of \\"computer safe-house backup locations\\" that the entity can move itself to, when threatened with being turned off.<br /><br />Throughout the story, it is left unclear whether the main character (multi-billionaire creator of the AI Alex Hoffman) is going nuts/losing his mind, or if the computer program VIXAL has done a perfect job of impersonating him via e-mail.  There are clues that it is a \\"little of both\\".<br /><br />This story draws on ideas presented in Edward M. Lerner's novella SURVIVAL INSTINCT(2002), about a selectively-bred \\"predator AI\\", that gets loose on the Internet; but THE FEAR INDEX is much more believable and enjoyable.

1441761268|5.0|This is on my top ten favorite books list!  A real page turner.  You will want to read every word on every page because there is that much happening.  The author's passion for this story shines through in the voice of every character.  She has a real gift for storytelling.  The truth of the matter is painful at times, but keeps you hungering to find out what happens next.  Would be an awesome, Gone With the Wind kind of MOVIE!  The audio version is really good too!  Highly recommend both.

B007SGM084|3.0|It's entertaining but I have to say i had some issues with this book.  1. was the lanuage wasn't realistically American  2. in my option Christian was too hot and with each book became more unrealistic and emasculated  3. The last book was too much drama.  I honestly had a hard time going through the 2nd book and the beginning of the 3 book dragged. 4. The erotica in it was ok and the scences were short....I've read better.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I recently purchased a Seiko 5 and am extremely impressed with the quality of this watch at a price point under $70.  Very stylish.  Keeps accurate time.  Has all the charm of the automatics.  I give it 5 stars not because it is the best automatic on the planet, but because it is an amazingly good one for the money.<br /><br />As a collector of automatic watches,  this one certainly doesn't have the precise feel of the more expensive ones but, again, I am drawn to the fact that this is simply a good value in an automatic.  The dial is flawless even under close scrutiny, the crystal is very clear, and the red-tipped second sweep hand adds a nice touch.<br /><br />I am amused to read some of the reviews written by people who apparently expected a $300-$500 watch when they purchased the Seiko 5.  Ok, how nice it must be to live in that little fantasy land in which you live.  Perhaps you expected a Bently when you purchased your Chevy??  Oh, and another thing, be aware that an automatic is a watch means that, by its nature, it has to be manually wound up in order to work.  I think that is much of the charm of these watches.  It will stop if you aren't wearing it, but it will NEVER need a battery.  If you don't like that, forget this watch, buy a cheap quartz, and deep-six it when the battery dies.<br /><br />When I received my watch, I didn't even crack open the instructions and had the time, date, and day set and strapped on my wrist in less than a minute.  And it has kept perfect time ever since.  Easy to set, nice looking, and runs very well.  Not much more to ask for from a watch.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Three quarters through this movie, I was thinking that I would title my Amazon review as 'Disturbing,' and leave it at that. Yes, it was a disturbing movie in some respects, but not in the way one would feel after watching a movie about Nazi Germany.<br /><br />As others have written here, it's best not to go into any details about this film. How to start, even if I did?<br /><br />Independent of any themes or storylines, this movie was well-acted by every (!!) character. Outstanding performances.<br /><br />This is the kind of film you watch and want to discuss/analyze in a study group of some sort.<br /><br />I don't really know what else to say. It's different from all the other movies I've seen by this Director and I have no regrets having watched it. But for now, I need to go sit outside with a glass of wine and ponder/reflect upon what I just saw.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was actually saddened when I finished the trilogy and moped around for a couple of days (weird, but true!).  It wasn't just all about the sex, not even close.  Yes, it's erotica, but I have read much more racy than this, it's an unusual but wonderful love story.  This is a wonderfully complex character, Christian, and I am actually considering reading them again.  I read all three in 6 days.
1594745692|5.0|All I know about tarot readings I learned from watching movies/tv, so I am almost positive I know nothing about doing a proper reading. However, when I received my copy of The Zombie Tarot in the mail I sat down and read through the manual and then began scanning the cards...hours later I was ready to attempt a reading. I say hours because the cards are so amazingly detailed that I had to spend time scrutinizing each one at length.<br /><br />The manual in The Zombie Tarot gives you several card layouts in order to conduct your reading. I choose to use the 'Gravestone' layout as it seemed most fitting to a reading for surviving the undead.<br /><br />Here are the meanings behind 3 of the 6 cards I drew:<br /><br />Card #1 The Knight of Cups: Romantic*Adventure*Moody - He's the one with the ready smile and a surfboard underneath his arm. A natural charmer, the Knight of Cups is always ready to schmooze-and always keeps one eye on the exit. He can be fun to have around, but his mood will change like the surf, and he's often likely to steal more than a kiss. Watch your heart, literally.<br /><br />Card #3 The Star: Recognition*Inspiration*Achievements - You're on the right track for the important things in life while good luck and a fresh attitude bring new opportunities. Take a minute to revel in your accomplishments and then move on to the next level of awesome. Others look to you for inspiration and guidance while scraping zombie goo off their shoes . What's your plan?<br /><br />Card #6 The Sun: Success*Enlightenment*Hope - Sweet success! The morning sun has risen and the rescue teams have arrived. After foiling a hostile takeover by the undead you've earned a one-way ticket to a safer place. Now it's time to make plans for the future: consider traveling to warmer climates or getting a new job. There's good money in corpse disposal nowadays...<br /><br />The Zombie Tarot is perfect for the next time you're with a group of friends, sitting around watching Night of the Living Dead and discussing who has the best plan for surviving the uprising. Don your scarves, bangles, baubles and crystal ball and get ready for a fun night of reading the cards. The cards will speak the truth as to who will survive and who will not.he Living Dead and discussing who has the best plan for surviving the uprising.

B005EWDA3I|4.0|This is actually a review of the whole story, Book 1,2 and 3. Book three resolves the whole story in an unsurprising, obvious way. Sadly this is also a way which renders the title to be a non-sensical attempted ingratiation to 1984. Let me warn you: the books have nothing to do with 1984 to the point of me supposing the author never read, or at least understood the work he is referring to.<br /><br />Besides from this (I ignore some sections which where needless explicit), the books are solid despite being lengthy at times. I find it interesting (having lived in close to Tokyo for some time) how Murakami captures the different parts of the city and the region. The story captures some aspects of self-perception of the Japanese society in the form of sterotypes. Seen from this aspect, the resolution of the story is a kind of revelation which even contains some morale.
B003O86FMW|5.0|ok this book is amazing just like the first book is. its a contuned of the first and theres no other way to put it besides it just amazing and you need to read it and it will leave you wanting to read the next
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this game  a nice way to wind down after a long day(y. The graphics are slick and the cards go to their proper position with just a tap of your finger.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|One of my book friends texted me and told me I had to read this book. We have similar book taste so I bought it and started it the next day. I swear I would have walked around the house with my Kindle all day not speaking to anyone if I could've gotten away with it. It's like the perfect storm of everything I die for in a book.<br /><br />I was skeptical the first two chapters because I thought 'Been here, seen this.' Um, no. The entire story is so unique and Abby and Travis's relationship is absurdly addicting to read. Their relationship is passionate and volatile...and sweet. Abby is so likeable and every decision she makes made sense to me, I didn't have to forgive the book anything because there was nothing to pick apart. Travis is...how do I put this...I mean, can I marry a fictional character yet? Is that possible? :)<br /><br />Seriously though, there are so many reasons to love this book and I can't do it justice. Read it!! It stands on its own merit. This is definitely a must-read and I'm now dying to read it again. AND I *needs* to see this as a movie!<br /><br />For more Reviews visit my blog: My Tower of Books - [...]

B004LP3AYI|5.0|I will agree with previous reviews regarding the number of typographical errors in the book - it could use a good editor, however, it did not distract me from reading.  I read a review criticizing the epilogue about the Sisters of the Dark at the end,saying it was out of sync with the chapters - it was an epilogue to lead you into the 3rd book, giving you a teaser that the tale was not yet finished.  I have been a fan of Terry Brooks for many years and have read everything he has written.  I longed for a good fantasy tale the let my mind soar into worlds I could never be part of - to help me lose myself from the normal \\"hum-drum daily life of working, paying bills, and taking care of everyone else's problems - and I found Terry Goodkind.  Goodkind, like Brooks, takes you into a world of magic and fantasy.  The character development is so complete, you begin to feel you have known Richard and Kahlan and Zeb your entire life.  I admit, looking ahead to how many books there are in this story line is a bit daunting - but if #10 is as good as #1, it will be a well-read journey.

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|And yes some are challenging but puzzle lovers expect that! at first I hated the robot puzzle but after I took a break and tried again it was easy. I didnt figure out until I was half done that you could switch pages and do them in the order you wished and I guess I also didnt pay attention to what the orbs were for so I didnt get to skip until towards the end and used those on the matchsticks. I loved the pegs, squares,and the marbles the most. Some of the ho scenes were challenging enough to run down the timer but since you have to start over you could go straight to the difficult one first/last to use up the time and then quickly go through the easier puzzles. The most difficult yet entertaining one was the one where you pick up the crystal it wasnt so annoying that it made me want to quit but just frustrating enough to make me wanna pick the dang thing up and laugh lol. Anyway great game its on sale now but was well worth the original 3$ I paid because you can spend lots of hours playing it and ppl newer to puzzles would get even more play time out of it

B0067EKY7M|5.0|When I contemplate whimsy and fantasy, I'm transported to the mountains of Scotland or Ireland, populated with Scottish or Irish accented locals and wee folk and fairies.  This little film, reminiscent of 1983 great Scottish film \\"Local Hero\\", lets an Ohio chap like myself remember the magic of the highlands of Scotland and imagine a world where we all get along and the boy gets the girl.  Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt make the perfect couple and the story of East and West working together for a common cause (in this case fishing) is uplifting and hopeful.  A wonderfully inspiring film.
B003O86FMW|5.0|In short: what an ending! First thing i did after finishing \\"Catching Fire\\" was downloading the next book.<br /><br />  If you liked the first book, you'll definetly love this one.Full of surprises, more twisted games from the capitol and needles that discomforts us about the world we all living in.I loved Haymitch more, hated the capitol more and about Katniss, i think she perfectly behaves as one should expect of a teenager.Some may find her disturbing because of the way she acts but i think the way she handles or can't handle the situations made the book more realistic.<br /><br />  Since we've all known the characters already,it was more focused on the events.I can't wait to read the final book and see what happens next.
0385737947|1.0|I normally love this sort of book, but this one is poorly written. The main character, Thomas, is not very interesting or fully developed. I actually found the side characters more interesting, although all they do is bicker. Scene after scene of pointless bickering. I started skimming pages. The girl character is never fully developed at all -- no personality and spends most of the book in a coma or jail cell. She and Thomas feel an intense connection to one another, but have boring conversations. I found the first half of the book especially annoying, because all Thomas does is ask questions that no one will answer, which seemed like an artificial way of building mystery and suspense in the reader. The second half is more interesting, but I guessed every move before it happened. And the ending is NOT an ending at all, just a step to the next book. I read a lot of books in this genre and usally love them, (buy them for my kids and read along with them), but found this one to be especially poorly written and flat.

0451197879|5.0|I knew the fact that Roadwork isn't a horror story from the start, and I somewhat left the book behind, but one day I said I'll \\"try it.\\" Even though Roadwork isn't a \\"King\\" novel that might be filled with blood and gore, scary scenses and unforgettable details, Roadwork is, indeed, a much slower novel but it really captures the soul and darkness of what human beings really are.<br /><br />The book was written due to his mother's death, and King really wanted a book that deals \\"a human being that is hurt emotionly.\\" So Roadwork was written, which King sets Bart Dawes standing in the way of \\"progress\\" as the city and road crew are trying to destroy his home.<br /><br />As the days are coming forward, the readers get to read each day how Dawes really feels about his house being torn down, and because of this, he becomes a totally different man. The relationship with his wife becomes unstable, his actions at work will cost his job, how he wants to blow up the eqipment, and he becomes a stranger ot himself that he hardly knows his true self anymore (the scenes with the hitchhiker and the party where he gets high prove it).<br /><br />Nontheless, if you are looking for a King book to get away from the horror and to read a setting based on real life experiences--then Roadwork is for you.<br /> If you still wondering about Roadwork but you really want to read one of his other horror novels, then you are not ready for Roadwork.

B007MDB71O|5.0|A great film that seemed to go far over the heads of critics and and deep under the heel of marketing executives.  Burroughs' classic adventure tale is the reason there ever was a Star Wars, a Star Trek, or an Avatar, but it doesn't suffer as a film in spite of their existence.  The film is long, the plot complex, and perhaps a bit old-fashioned and even-tempered for modern audiences.  For me, this makes John Carter a movie that I will watch and rewatch, experiencing it at my leisure like an old storybook.  From that perspective, I can't think of a better tribute to Edgar Rice Burroughs' original work.
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|It's a shame there won't be any more of the \\"girl\\" books, and if you have read the first two in the series, this one is like getting together with an old friend. On the other hand, if you haven't read them,\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\".must be hard to follow or understand. Like the earlier books this one is a thriller from the first page, but much of the book is devoted to rehashing \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\".The rehash comes in bits and pieces, but it all comes together for the veteran Steig reader. To others,??<br />For me, it's another great page turner, hard to put down and even harder to see it end.

B005LAIHQ8|5.0|MIB 1 did something rare - it created a wonderful atmosphere of stragithfaced implausibility, with huge chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones. MIB 2 followed fairly predictably. It worked, but sequel-slump had set in. So, in deference to the memory of MIB 1, I saw this - but didn't get my hopes up too far.<br /><br />As a result, the humor and especially the warmth of this one took me pleasantly by surprise. Given the time-travel theme, it's both a sequel to the others and a prequel. (Josh Broslin, by the way, does a flawless job as the 1960s K.) Saying more would say too much, so let's leave the plot description there - suffice it to say that it's a lot more touching that I had any reason to expect, and a lot more explanatory.<br /><br />Additional characters worked well this time. Emma Thompson's \\"Agent O\\" character echoed Dame Dench's \\"M\\" from the recent Bond flicks, but that throat-scraping introduction set a whole different mood. And, speaking as life-long nerd, Griffin just charmed me. Maybe not one for the ages, this is still a great restart of the franchise, but also very watchable in itself. Despite the general trend of movie sequels, this really leaves me hoping for more.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters

0393088774|4.0|*A full summary of this book is available here: [[ASIN:B00HMTR0Z0 An Executive Summary of Paul Krugman's 'End This Depression Now!']]<br /><br />The main argument: Since the housing and financial crash of 2008, America's economy has been stuck deep in the doldrums. Indeed, GDP has remained well beneath pre-2008 levels, and employment levels have failed to recover. In an effort to resuscitate the economy, the American government tried first to jump-start it through stimulus spending, and has now replaced this approach with greater austerity. Nothing seems to be working. For Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman, though, the answer is clear: the problem is that the original stimulus effort was too small, and, since that time, the government is moving squarely in the wrong direction. Indeed, Krugman argues that America's current situation bares a striking resemblance to the stagnation of the Great Depression, and that history has taught us what to do in such situations: the government must take an aggressive approach to stimulate the economy into recovery. This is the argument that Krugman makes in his new book `End This Depression Now!'.<br /><br />Now, Krugman is not a proponent of big government spending under normal conditions. Indeed, even in a recession, Krugman's preferred approach is to drop interest rates in order to spur consumer spending. The problem now is that interest rates are already at zero, and this has not been enough to get consumer spending off the ground, thus leaving the economy in what is called a `liquidity trap'. For Krugman, the liquidity trap is actually quite common in economic downturns that follow financial crashes (as is the case with the current one, and as was the case with the Great Depression), and is why such slumps tend to be deep and prolonged.<br /><br />According to Krugman, the best and surest way to save an economy from a liquidity trap is for the government to step in and undertake the spending that consumers won't. That is, the government must stimulate the economy back into action, until consumers can get back on their feet enough to take over for themselves.  For Krugman, this is precisely what happened in America during WWII, when the government's military spending served to stimulate the economy and save it from the grips of the Great Depression.<br /><br />Now, Krugman's opponents will point out that the American government has already tried the stimulus approach during this downturn, and that this approach did not work, thus showing that it cannot be relied upon. What's more, these same opponents argue that the government's debt is already enormous, and indeed dangerously high, and that further government spending at this point may well render the debt completely unmanageable, if not force the government into insolvency (which is indeed a threat that is currently being faced by several countries in the European Union). Finally, Krugman's detractors maintain that pumping more money into the economy at this time only threatens to drive up inflation to dangerous levels, perhaps even triggering a hyperinflationary spiral.<br /><br />Krugman, though, claims that he has answers to all of these objections. In the first place, as noted above, the author maintains that the failure of the government's first stimulus effort did not prove that this approach is ineffective, but that it simply wasn't large enough to do the trick. Second, Krugman argues that though government debt does pose a concern, America's debt is actually not that dangerous by historical standards. What's more, since America has its own currency (unlike the countries of the European Union), it is able to print money to turn over its debt, thus preventing the possibility of bankruptcy. Finally, with regards to inflation, Krugman maintains that inflation simply cannot get off the ground in a depressed economy (as the current situation would attest to), and that when it is triggered in an upturn the government can always reverse its policy, thus keeping it firmly in check.<br /><br />Krugman does bring up some important points that do deserve to be taken into consideration in the current economic debate.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I bought this book because of the author photo. I was captivated by Gillian Flynn which led me to the review which left me with the question of whether a murder really happened? I resisted buying it all of one afternoon. I bought it for my Kindle and read it over three days. It is not the usual type of book I read. Think Robert B,. Parker, Ace Atkins, Stephen Cannell and page turning thrillers and mysteries. This was a winter novel where you curl up under a handmade afghan while your partner reads a leather bound book and you turn the juicy pages that enmesh you, whether you like it or not, inside the souls of the characters. Though in farness, you might wonder if any of the characters have souls. The first half is very slow unless you like that kind of in depth character development. HOWEVER, when you get about half way through all hell breaks loose. The roller coaster ride of who to root for begins at a zenith and goes through a maze of complex loops and mind numbing drops that leave you colder inside than Neil Armstrong in July 1969.<br /><br />Should you buy this book, read it to the end to get full value out of it. Because if you put it down, I guarantee it will suck you back in to the depravity, hopelessness and forever looking over your shoulder world of Nick and Amy Dunne.

B004Y12S9W|5.0|I just got this in the mail. Hooked it up with my 15 ft HDMI cable and turned on the TV & iPad, and it's great. My family travels with me on business often, and I wanted my son to be able to watch his cartoons when he wanted, especially since there's not a lot to choose from at some hotels. He will now be able to watch Thomas The Train whenever he wants, and I don't have to worry about him watching anything but his cartoons. My TV is a 50\\" Plasma, and when you go to watch a video on the iPad, it takes up the whole screen on the TV and the picture is perfect! I can't think of any way that this product could possibly be any more satisfying. This will also allow my wife and I to watch movies on the go too. I'd recommend this to anyone that has an iPad, I'm going to try it out on the iPhone soon.
B007SGM084|5.0|Of all the books I have read this year this one blew me away. There is a little bit of each character in all of us some of us just go forward more open than others. I can't wait to see what comes next. I finished this series in 4 days and simply didn't want it to end.

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is off the heisy off the chain and off anything that u can think of it's awesome believe me
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|I read through many of the reviews until I found one I totally agrees with -Viewer (USA)- the movie does not really follow the book at all, but I sat through th show waiting for the ending, which to me made the book worh reading more than once. The true ending (book) is unsettling, unexpected and creepy as I imagine the author intended. This movie is a watered down version of the book. Now I remember why I don't go to see movies based on  books I enjoyed; they are not up to the written word.
B0086700CM|3.0|Its a great game but I give it a 3 star because sometimes when you try to turn it jumps or slides!

B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This review is for \\"BLADERUNNER 5-DISC SET (without suitcase)\\" on HD DVD format.<br /><br />I know, the format is long dead, but HD DVDs are still pretty cool!<br />I mean the resolution is AS GOOD as Blu-ray, sound ALMOST AS GOOD, and features are pretty much the same as the Blu-ray version. And this item is 3 times cheaper to buy than the Blu-ray! I'm sorry, i just have an affinity for products with style and integrity. ;)<br /><br />So anyway, i bought this great item for around $12, and it is one of the most satisfying purchases i've ever received. All 5 versions of the film are in 1080P!<br />Even the rare Workprint! -Which i think is the best variant due to certain audio alterations, more time in the flying spinner police vehicles, less music, more street speak from Gaff, and some never before seen shots of the first Bladerunner shown in the film: Holden, albeit he is laid up in a life support vessel while Dekard cracks wize.. :p<br /><br />The real treat for anyone who actually has the Toshiba HD DVD player or Xbox 360 extension drive, is most definitely The Final Cut.<br />This excellent transfer was scanned at over 4 times normal RES from the original film source, so only The Final Cut is truly worthy of competing with Blu-ray.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br />-b<br /><br />NOTE: If u buy this movie make sure all 5 discs work and that u only have 1 copy of the Workprint and 1 copy of The Final Cut, (obviously including the other 3 discs), and that they ALL play perfectly.

015204907X|5.0|We have had this book since my boys were babies. It has always been on their most asked for list of books. We lost it for a couple of years, and recently we went on a mad hunt trying to find this lovely little book. They are now nine, and having rediscovered, \\"Where is the green sheep?\\"  they have asked for it to be read to them over and over!!! Even though they can read, the love to have this little book read to them. This is a GREAT GREAT GREAT book!!!! We love love love this book with it's adorable and whimsical drawings and catchy rhymes!
B007BZM3HK|1.0|There has to be a point where people stop clinging to every overproduced, lyrics-devoid-of-anything-smart, pop for the masses.  This song is not only annoying, but already overplayed on the radio.  It's my opinion, but that's what these reviews are for.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Both discs play great, couple very tiny scratches on them (doesn't hinder performance). Shipped without the slip cover, which is a bit of a bummer, but DEFINITELY not a deal breaker. Shipped and delivered in nine days, very sppedy!
B0083GPDBO|1.0|I despise movies that are supposedly made from a discoverd video (i.e. Cloverfield). This movie isn't even consistent in this aspect because obviously they could not film themselves during the climatic battle. Also, how would the footage shot at the end in Tibet ever have been found by the people who found the first part of the video in the U. S. ?  Save your money !!!
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I was completely skeptical about this soundtrack.  But it is a ton of fun!!  It's like doing karaoke with Tom Cruise.  Leave your cynicism at the door and just go for the ride with this one.  You won't be disappointed.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Not only was I blown away on the concert, I was also blown away by the cd.  I listen to every song except Rumor Has It.  (love the song) But her voice cracks in the live version.  I love everything about Adele, so if you want an entertaining dvd choose this

B0088RQ4X4|2.0|My family watched this long movie. Put me to sleep several times during the movie. 18 year old daughter complained we should of watched something else. Wife was not impressed. I guess if you are a total fan of the books, then this might be good for you. Now we know why it bombed at the box office. The beginning had some funny, amusing moments, but then turned dull and slow. We love to discuss movies after we've see them...we had nothing to say after this one. This was done in mostly CGI. Avatar was a far superior movie. For all the money they spent on this you would think Disney could do better. This one is a yawner.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|A Lot like Mario, but that's good since Mario games aren't out for Kindle or Android and probably never will be. Overall this game is as fun as the original Mario for Nintendo

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Ridley Scott has made another masterpiece. He has answered a million questions and left us with 10 million more. What a wild adventure. This is pure Sci-Fi narcotic. Forget the popcorn and forget the drink. This is an express elevator to man's ORIGINAL place in the universe. ENJOY !
B003I55BIA|5.0|This isn't the type of story I usually read, but I was plesantly surprised. It was a great story and I loved the ending.  I with the additional stories would have stayed with these characters.  I want to know what happened with them long term.
1466401885|4.0|I sometimes find it agonizing when faced with choosing a new book after finishing one that I've enjoyed but didn't fall in love with. After days of indecision I chose Beautiful Disaster. I don't often go for contemporary romance, and I couldn't stand the predictability of the last one I tried to get through, (something by Nicholas Sparks that I don't remember the name of and couldn't even get halfway through). Although I've seen the \\"I am SO not falling for your type!\\" story many times before, I helplessly got sucked into this one. I couldn't get the main characters out of my head and two days after I've finished I'm still thinking about our male protagonist. The female lead pissed me off more than once but without her flawed reasoning there wouldn't be a story to follow. I was an emotional wreck at work last week, thanks to this book, and I'm old enough to know better! Go ahead and read - it's the Ben & Jerry's of good reads!
B007YQ6SYK|5.0|Enjoy listening to this album very touching and relaxing and for the price it's a must have. I will defiantly let others know about this album.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I have tried and tried to care enough to finish this book; the characters are emotionally stunted, boring, egotistic...words fail me. I just can't believe I got this far reading about 2 people who elicit no emotion beyond absolutely nothing but their complete disappearance.<br />This is not a review about the writing which is fine....even the plot is OK. However when the characters, who not only were dreadful at the beginning but continue to reveal ever more unappetizing traits..... really who cares enough about them to bother finishing.<br />Sadly, I paid the kindle price....gag....which is why I read as much as I did....
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Whether you're a fan of Apple or not, this story will entertain, educate, and inspire you. I could not put the Kindle down.
0099579936|3.0|From what I'd heard, sounded like a fun fantasy book, so I put up with its cliché beginning (awkward, disheveled girl-next-door \\"stumbles\\" into super hot guy's office and he is immediately entranced...oh brother). At first I found the sexual tension and build-up to their relationship entertaining and hard to put down. After that, the terrible, lazy, monotonous writing just got in the way, making it a tedious read. Enough with the blushing and the lip-biting and the breath-hitching and the British diction for American characters. And Christian was straight out of Ellis's American Psycho; I found his transformation into \\"lovesick puppy\\" so inauthentic.
B00785P2QC|5.0|nice game. I like how indojt have to use energy to harvest or reset stuff I got 20 mill Andre very proud ofnit
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I couldn't wait to read this book. There are so many books about Vampires but not many about Witches. I was so happy to get this book until I opened it. Steven King look out...you have competition. I thought reading SK was the worse til now. I even tried to listen to the audio version it read just as slow. It did help me sleep. Now I have to look else where for a good Witch book.

B000GS9YSA|5.0|This is a must read for anybody who likes old classic's. Step back in time with Steinbeck's novel about early American life and the way people fled to California for greener pastures.<br />  The way of life before the Joad's packed up all their belongings and left, to the long hard trip out west and what they encountered once there, will keep you turning page after page.<br />  One of the top 100 novels of all time. Don't miss out on a excellent story about our American past that Steinbeck portrays in one of his finest works. A work of art.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker it is, and even more enthralling than the first. This is the first book I've managed to read front to back in 48 hours. I simply could not put it down.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book, it is one of the best books I have ever read!  It is like my guilty pleasure.  Can't put it down but don't want it to end.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I read Dragon Bound on the advice of Jayne Ann Krentz. She mentioned it on FB, and since I like Jayne and I like dragons, I thought there was a good shot that I'd like Dragon Bound. This turned out to be BRILLIANT on my part, because I LOVED LOVED LOVED Dragon Bound. Alpha Hero who is a gajillionnaire and can shift into a dragon--love it. Feisty heroine with mysterious magical potential--love it. Alpha hero falls immediately and intensely in love--and vice versa?  Love it. Add to it a fast moving storyline and a pack of secondary characters with great potential for more books and it rings all the buy me bells. It was just as good the third time I read it as the first. The world building is phenomenal and every book in the series has just made it all better. Thea Harrison moved to the top of my favorite authors list which includes greats like: Linda Howard, Lois McMaster Bujold, Sharon Shinn, Lisa Kleypas, and J.D. Robb. So if those authors are your cup of tea, then trust me, Thea Harrison fits right in with that illustrious crowd.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|3 dollars and only 2 planets?? C'mon! should have waited until the game was finished before releasing.  A new level is now available and its still not ready to be uploaded to my kindle fire! Disappointed

0374275637|5.0|Thinking fast and slow is the culmination of the decades of research of Daniel Kahneman and his  posthumous colleague Amos Tversky. (For the ones who give weight to awards Kahneman is a Psychologist who won a Nobel Prize in Economics, a strange quirk)<br />Daniel Kahneman talks about how minds are divided into two systems System 1 and System 2. System 1 is our intuition, the fast one, the quick and the default decision maker. System 2 is the rational one, the one that does the hard thinking. Kahneman of course makes the point that System1 and System2 are convenient abstractions and are only models that make it much easier to think about how the the mind works.<br />The best way to describe the book would be say that it resembles Blink by Malcolm Gladwell, only its a lot more rigorous.<br />He talks about several human fallacies and how man is in fact not rational but can be manipulated. He talks about experts in which fields are really experts. He points out that to truly become an expert one needs constant feedback so anyone who makes long term predictions is basically incompetent because he has no feedback. Anyone is just as qualified as he is to make an assessment. The political commentators are the example he takes. He also points that Mutual funds are a giant scam and that they are no better than monkeys when it comes to choosing stocks. (They are actually slightly worse).<br />He also talks about people being more risk averse than gain seekers. A person will take more chances to avoid losing than gaining something even though economically both might be the same. He places several examples but the one I remember is one about golfers. Most golfers will putt better when they have to save a bogey than when they have a chance for a birdie.(For the numerically inclined the difference is around 4%, a sizable difference in a game where tournaments are usually won by a one stroke lead).<br />He talks about intuition and gives clearest definition of intuition that I have encountered. He says that intuition is recognition very simply. He points that  a surgeon operating is no more special than a child recognizing a ball. (Admittedly this might be an over simplification but its a good definition nonetheless and a clear and simple one).<br />The book is also peppered with anecdotes on his collaboration with Amos Tversky and many other psychologists and economists. He also talks about the time he spent in the Israeli Army and how he was able to apply his training as a psychologist to the problems that he encountered. These lend the book a surprisingly melancholic feeling of someone who has carried out his life's work and laid bare his soul for all to see.<br />Its a fascinating book but its a long one as well at around 500 pages(I enjoyed it so I didn't really feel it). Daniel Kahneman writes extremely clearly and leaves absolutely no room for confusion. Too often non fiction books get caught in trying to use fancy verbiage which render the subject under consideration unintelligible.  If you don't feel upto reading Thinking fast and slow you might want to watch this talk Kahneman gave which sums up the book and his findings far better than I ever could. There are also a lot of extracts doing rounds on the web so you might want to check those out as well.

0553801473|2.0|What happened to a Song of Ice and Fire.<br />I still remember being gripped and hooked by the first three books in the series. The books were big but never long to read. I devoured the pages. Scenes still stick out in my head. I loved the way Martin confounded my expectations at every turn. How he twisted the characters and how the POV made everyone seem right. I enjoyed the way he turned Jaime Lannister around in a Storm of Swords. Martin was a writer at the height of his powers but then the inevitable fall began.<br />The downfall started wtih Feast and it was a torrid bore. It felt big, there was no tension, there was nothing I could take away from the book. Dance I thought would be better but it too disappointed with everyone just walking from point A to point B. I could hardly believe that this was the same Martin who penned scenes like the Red Wedding. The introduction of the Direwolves set everything up wonderfully. In that one scene you knew who the characters were, what sort of world this was. You knew that Jon Snow was a bastard, one of the Starks and yet not one of them, you knew that Eddard Stark was an honorable man. The entrance of the Lannisters was magnificently written. The twists just kept coming and all the while the writing was stellar. Tyrion just delivered. His wit and piercing insight into affairs made him everyone's favorite dwarf. You could almost always feel the pain when Littlefinger spoke of Catelyn Stark. The story always moved forward. There was no room for standing still. Martin possessed this ability of introducing characters but you felt as if you had known them all along but the magic just vanished.<br />Feast and Dance were soap opersa in which it made absolutely no difference if you skipped pages and scenes because you became reasonably sure that nothing of note would really happen. There was some memorable stuff but they were so scattered and so few in between that it was worse than trying to find a needle in a haystack.<br />Worse than this was the fact that no mainstream publication seemed to take a stand and say that a Dance with Dragons was boring. Everyone was effusive. It was almost as if they had been paid to do a positive review or they didn't want to risk saying anything contrarian.<br />Martin was on song in the first three books but he just seems to have lost his muse. I hope he rediscovers it in the Winds of Winter and keeps it focussed and stops it from meandering about.<br />From [...]
B000V6BE6C|5.0|I wrote a review of Nightmare not so long ago saying it was a masterpeice of musical talent sort of spaking.  I just listen to this album from Avenged Sevefold and I have to say that it is another masterepice by this band.  For the critics out there I can understand how some of you say that is Avenged Sevenfold's black album.  Just like Metallica did so long ago, made some die hardcore fans lose intrest in a band that they love.  I personally have to say that I love certain metal and rock bands, I'm enjoying this band more and more as they mature in their songs and lryics.  I enjoy the songs Afterlife, Little peice of Heaven, Lost, But what got me was the ending mixture of Rock and Country feel to the guitar called Dear God.  But just like Nightmare listen to this album with an open mind and see feel the lryics as the singer shows you another journey the band went threw to make this album for their fans and make some new fans along with way.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|No different from Deths other Albums since Risk, this album kicks ass. I was particularly amazed by 44 minutes. No cooler subject for a metal tune than a famous bank robbery. I have to rank this as easily one of their better offerings. Once again Mustaine and Co. delivers....and the delivery is good. Any Megadeth fan should love the tasty guitar riffs and in your face lyrics. GOOD STUFF!

I love TSCHAIKOWSKI Violin Concerto played by VILDE FRANG very much. I think she has a talent, that is a different kind of Anne-Sophie Mutter. She draws delicate bows at the 2nd theme of the 1st movement (4' 16) and the 2nd theme of recapitulation (15' 18), that is she sings well. She sings well Canzonetta Andante of the 2nd movement, that charms me. No faults in her performance of TSCHAIKOWSKI Violin Concerto. She is a true artist and a true entertainer.

B007PS0X0W|2.0|There is very little substance to this movie.  Rise of the Lycans was a far better film with an interesting plot which gave a backstory to the other films.  This is just ... nothing.  I couldn't even hate the villains as they were rather pathetic and not well fleshed out enough for me to get vested in them.  It was great having Beckinsale back, but she was wasted in this film.  The action was pretty good, but really this film is pretty light on everything else.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Seen Prometheus three times now.Each time enjoy it more.I have always wanted to know the back story of the Engineers and this film starts to clarify this.I also love the interior of the derelict ship from Alien and Giger's imagination of the egg silo,cockpit and corridors and alien life.Real atmosphere and scary as hell.<br />I love Alien and always cared about the Space Jockey/Engineer,this film addresses this and pays its respect to Swiss genius HR Giger.The father of Xenomorphs.Also get to see the Derelict ship in all its glory.Something like an Alien Titanic?<br />This film explains mans' origins and has a believable and plausible story to it.The special fx are superior to Avatar and not Disney/alice in wonderland mentality with humans being enemy of decency.If the Engineers got their hands  on Navi they'd rip out their limbs easily and be no contest.They and their technology superior to all terrestial beings.<br />I dont like Damon Lindelof,his contribution to the script is interracial relationships like in Star Trek and Prometheus eg Captain Kirk with Uhura and Vickers with Janek,this is evolution for us mortals on Earth?Perhaps that is why space jockeys came to Earth to destroy everybody.God created separate races,man tries to mix them. According to him ,Lindelof,.evolution is destroying your racial identity with mixed offspring.This seems to be the mentality of Hollywood.<br />If you are wanting to relive Aliens,forget this film.If you are a fan of original Alien and Ridley Scott fan,then this film should sate your appetite.Every franchise is promoting white alpha males/females with black male/female partners.<br />Prometheus could do with more length to film,but hopefully sequel done by Scott with no Lindelof can hopefully fulfil this small complaint.<br /><br />\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

6302516919|5.0|This has been my favorite film since I was probably 12 years old (about 10 years), and there are many reasons why.<br />  Christine, to start with, has everything. Drama, suspense, mystery, romance, and science fiction, to name the most common, and in all these avenues it's displayed in a satisfying and realistic way. The storyline is excellent, with many social twists and turns that are so real it's engaging. A lover's triangle, a lost cause (Arnie Cunningham) losing himself in something he can relate too and make definite progress on (quote: \\"For the first time in my life I've found something that's uglier than me, and I know I can fix her up.\\"). He's extremely awkward around women, has very little confidence, but is highly intelligent and moral. He even somewhat looks like the late great Buddy Holly in the beggining (which makes since, sense Christine is a '50s automobile). When he finds something that can boost his confidence, he grabs it. It was no mistake that Christine chose him. He was the perfect guy for her to seduce into her sinister world.<br />  I'm one of those people that feels to a certain degree that the end justifies the means, but I also think it's good in a story to let a person decide for themselves what the ending will be, since we're all different. Christine fits that. The ending can be taken 2 ways: She comes back, or she's dead. My view is that Christine finally died. It can be viewed in the movie that her speedometer is continuously running backwards instead of forwards (which Stephen King did in the novel as well, and said that his intention was to imply that the car was constantly getting younger instead of older. It's appearance follows suit throughout the film). But at the final scene in Darnell's garage, Christine's speedometer is unmistakably seen as dropping past 000000 to 999999, and she is completely demolished shortly after that. It could be implied there that the 999999 symbolized her death was coming. In this way Arnie served apurpose. By his death, Christine lost her purpose for living, and that rendered her extinction. And she was in such shambles at the end that her coming back to life is almost inconceivable (and even though that piece of chrome slightly creaks at the end, the way it moves and sounds symbolizes weakness and age; to me it was her \\"last twitch\\"). So there's a wonderful moral to the story: simply put, even the most negative of outcomes can be used to produce a positive result.<br />  The soundtrack to this movie was brilliant. The movie was excellent to start with; the score amplified it and gave it even MORE magic. Alan Howarth has always done terrific work with scores for motion pictures, as well as John Carpenter. The both of them I truly consider to be at the genius level.<br />  So yeah, this film I would HIGHLY recommend. I think I've seen it 20 times over the past ten years, and I'm STILL not sick of it (and I rarely watch a movie more than once unless I REALLY like it). I would ALSO recommend that you read the book first, though. There's something about reading the novel itself, and then seeing it \\"come to life\\" on screen. Even though the movie can't bring everything to life (not enough time), you have the whole story from the book fresh in your mind while you're watching it, which makes the movie much better. Watching the movie BEFORE reading the book tends to have a dissatisfying experience (I find).<br />  Favorite novel by Stephen King also. He's another genius.<br />  Long-a-dee-o-so!
0143119680|2.0|I hate leaving a bad review. Honestly I don't do it often, but then again it's not often that a book comes along that I feel I MUST WARN PEOPLE ABOUT. A firend suggested the book knowing I have liked books of the genre and she said though she overall liked it she know a lot of people who didn't and she could see where many people wouldn't enjoy it. I got the sample for my kindle and it seemed ok so I bought the book. WHAT A MISTAKE!<br /><br />Not only is this book long it's also boring. It's so sad because what could have been a decent plot was contaminated with every single cliche possible.<br />Spoilers:<br />The main character Diane isn't just \\"a witch\\" she the ultimate and most powerful witch ever to be born. Shes has every single magical power ever known. She is stunning and doesn't see what about her is so beautiful. She's also a genius and scholar. She isn't just athletic... she excels at every sport. She;s strong and independant (yet lets this vampire control everything about her). And speaking of the vampire, Mathew same goes for him. He's ancient, super good looking, super rich, yadda, yadda yadda. The writer hits all the cliches including prophecy, cross species pregnancy, a authority forbidding cross species love, rebellion, you get the idea. And the dialog. Ugh!!!<br /><br />But let's put the crapy characters aside. The book is boring. It's just boring!!! The writer spends about 5% of the book on action and 95% on absolutely useless content... and in a book this unneccesarily long that 95% felt even bigger. Did we have to hear in detail the entire layout or Oxford? Did we have to have every second of Dianes rowing or running or walking told? The quotes from ancient text, the details about alchemy... it was all broth, no meat and very little potatoe. Who cares about all the details of every alchemy book she reads?!?!? And the page after page of her eatting, sleeping drinking tea and then repeating it all while pinning over her vampire... it honestly hurt to read! This book should have been a quarter of the length.<br /><br />So about 30% of the way through the book I could only recount about 2 significant things happening and though every fiber of my being wanted to stop the pain I decided to try an experiment. I read only 3 to 5 sentances of each page from that point on and honestly I didn't miss a thing!!! I read the remainder of the book much faster (thank GOD!!!) and though it ended much faster then if I had suffered through every agonizing word it was still terrible. But I could tell you the plot without reading the vast majority of the book!<br /><br />And the ending... if that's what you want to call it. I realize this book was going to be a series. But historically the best series are those in which the individual story can stand on it own and has some closure. You won't get that here.<br /><br />In fact I have never read a book with such a lack of closure where have I felt less compelled to read another installment.<br /><br />I knew early on this book would be bad and I'm still angry about it and my hands are flying acroos the keyboard trying to save anyone else this pain. Was this the worst book I have ever read? Maybe not, afterall I have had to stop reading 2 other books before becasue they were so bad. I did struggle through this one skimming and did make it to the end so no. It's not the worst book I have ever read but on the list it's probably #3. Because I did force myself to finish and didn't attempt suicide after is the only reason I gave this book 2 stars.<br />I wasted my money. Don't waste yours.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|Item was purchased to convert audio and video from a Macbook to an HD TV. It worked great for about a year, and then it just stopped working. Item was purchased directly from Apple. I am disappointed in the quality of the item, especially considering Apple sells it and it is more expensive than all other brands.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I wasn't sure about this book, but it was on sale for my Kindle so I got it. It was a while after that that I actually decided to read it because I was out of other books and not in a wifi spot to download more.<br /><br />Man I'm glad I was desperate for a read because this book was great!<br /><br />The writer was so amazing. I loved the characters, I loved the plot. I was so on the fence over it and it was great. I loved the main charachter Pi's take on relegion and some of the text was down right witty and often profound!<br /><br />I felt so wrapped up in the adventure. I had vivid imagery of the scenes, the desperation, the joy. I was emotionally tied to Pi and I can't wait for the movie to come out.<br /><br />I have recommended this book to 5 people who have all read it and love it as well.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Love that the story is told by alternating first-person accounts. The writing is intelligent, current and draws you in...I had to keep reading to find out the next twist.  And I very much enjoyed the characters' \\"pathologies.\\"  In the end, while hating that someone would stay in such a relationship I also found myself understanding the why of it.  And that was, maybe, the biggest twist of all. I'm going to put Ms. Flynn on my must-read list.

B0081KTI0E|4.0|This isn't a particularly original or innovative movie, just a good old fashioned ghost story which has you wondering if you saw what you thought you did. The location is superb and the filming is atmospheric. There is a little bit of gore, but for the most part the thrills are of the 'what's going to happen next' type.<br /><br />I'm a little surprised that so many reviews comment on Daniel Radcliffe as though he is a revelation in this movie. He was an accomplished child actor before Harry Potter and has done a number of things during and since the Potter films. He's a thorough professional and in this movie he needs to be, since he is in practically every scene.<br /><br />This is a good creepy movie for those who like mind games rather than more obvious horror.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|IT'S OK BUT A BIT BABYISH FOR MY TASTE.  MY GRANDKIDS LOVE IT!  SO IN THE RUN I GAVE IT FOUR STARS BECAUSE ITS EASY FOR ME TO METE OUT HELP IF THEY NEED IT.
0571276652|4.0|I've read this novel / collection 3 times. Found different things to love and question each read.<br /><br />The futile metaphysical quest for truth is on sincere display with these tales and their characters. I appreciate that immensely.<br /><br />The detective / mystery element, though engaging, does in retrospect feel like a means to an end. As do some of the characters' motivations and emotions. Cannot safely call them \\"real.\\"<br /><br />Doubt I could read it a fourth time. But then I've never read any book 4 times! The point is I would like to read this a fourth time.<br /><br />The nihilistic, solipsistic void is a guilty pleasure from college that I have never fully outgrown. It's the day to day grind of real work life that makes the indulgences of this book too vain for me to call truly \\"classic\\" in the timeless sense.<br /><br />Of course I remain unsure if that is about my changing view of this work or of my life. Which in many ways is the point of the book...
B00005JSGK|5.0|Not much to say except that it is a good DVD. I happen to love John Wayne movie. The price was inexpensive and I use this as a travel copy.
B004ETCM3Q|5.0|Anyone who has read this graphic novel, appreciates comics, and has any mature understanding of human nature must accept the magnificence herein.<br /><br />The movie could not do this justice, although I did like the movie.<br /><br />I have read this at least 3 times, maybe more now that I think on it... It is my favorite comic book story ever, which is no surprise to anyone who grew up reading comics in the late 80s and early 90s.<br /><br />And I don't think any comic series will ever really top it. Not without being as fundamentally groundbreaking.<br /><br />As for the writing, it is \\"Literature\\" in the highest sense, on par with prose classics like \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" Yes, I will stand by that statement.

Wool Omnibus Edition is definitely worth reading.  Great story. Engaging characters. Fast paced. I really liked it.  I just went into it with too high of expectations.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|They spent so much time in a boring back story that could have been used for acting.  No the acting wasn't great but that wasn't the problem.  The backstory was drawn out and boring.  Made it impossible to watch.

0807014273|5.0|I ready this book almost fifteen years ago as a required read for a class in college and I still think of it frequently to this day.  It's not an easy read, considering the subject matter is the holocaust, but it wasn't too graphic or gory.<br /><br />I left feeling a much greater sense of reverence and understanding for occurances that people would rather not know about, but also I left with a tremendous gratitude in my heart.<br /><br />This book changed my life.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The movie for last night was \\"Pride & Prejudice.\\" I found the DVD in our shelves and apparently it was something that my wife picked up and we failed to watch. Well, its a \\"best-film-of-the-year\\" type of movie no matter what year it might occur in. Without question. What can I possibly say? This movie already has over 1300 Amazon reviews and about 60% of them are five stars. And a lot of the reviews are exceptionally good. Well, it's a quite touching love story, actually two love stories, but I'm not going to dwell upon it. I'm just going to make a few remarks about things that especially impressed me.<br /><br />One was the setting. Magnificent! Where do they ever find such places in this modern world? The buildings and grounds were just immaculate! It was like being in the best park you could ever imagine. Everything was done to perfection and the photography was amazing. How do they ever manage to get big sweeping panoramic views with out a single power line, roadway or cars showing? Amazing! It really felt as if they had taken you way back to that pre-modern time. Does England have \\"preserves\\" like this just for the purpose of making classic movies?<br /><br />Secondly, the costumes were excellent! And so elaborate! And no doubt correct for the time. This movie paid attention to the details, believe me. And the interiors of some of the living quarters were just magnificent. Do the Brits really live like this? Well, I guess these were all upper-crust Brits, so I'll let this one pass by. However, any fancier of interior decorations and antiques is just going to be awe-struck by this movie. No expense was spared, and it's not some computer animation trick.<br /><br />Finally, the acting is just first rate. It always takes me a while to adjust to the stiff British methods, but it wasn't long before I felt like a part of the set and I laughed and suffered right along with the members of the cast. Well done! Also, the movie had an exceptionally good musical score. I thought the sound was a little too intrusive and interfered with the dialog here and there, but that's probably because it was set in surround sound and I watched it using a stereo sound system. In any case, this is just an exceptional movie. Five Stars!<br /><br />Gary Petersonhought the sound was a little too intrusive and interfered with the dialog here and there, but that's probably because it was set in surround sound and I watched it using a stereo sound system.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|\\"Ready Player One\\" is set in a dystopian future -- and these days, is there any other kind? -- in which people take refuge in the on-line universe known as OASIS.  OASIS is for MMO adventurers who level up by solving quests and fighting, and like [[ASIN:B0058M787I Dream Park]] and its sequels it achieves complete immersiveness through technological advances; but it is also for education and other amenities that are increasingly difficult to access in the real world.  Most of the story takes places in OASIS, as the avatar of our hero pursues the hidden \\"easter egg\\" that will bequeath the massive fortune of the creator of OASIS.  He is in competition with other questers, known as \\"gunters\\", but in more deadly opposition to the megacorporation IOI and its army of \\"Sixers\\".  The gunters are good and the Sixers are bad.  Nuff said.<br /><br />This plot is a pretty basic meal, but it is sublimely spiced by the fact that the quest is obsessively focused on the early days of computer and arcade gaming and the other entertainments of the era.  It is jam-packed with the details of the games, movies, songs, and TV of the '80's, and questing in OASIS acquires a sense of reality that is at least equal to that of the described future real world.<br /><br />I loved this book and will doubtless reread it at some point.  If you have hopes for the future expansion and immersiveness of MMOs, you will be intrigued; if you share the author's love for the '80's, you will be enchanted.  If you fall into both categories, \\"Ready Player One\\" will really hit your sweet spot and you should already be reading it!

B006RED4GA|3.0|This was a pretty decent ghost movie with a few bits of humor thrown in, but the ending left me asking \\"Was that it?\\". I was expecting some resolution, some reason behind it all, but there was nothing. Just your basic ghost story that just sort of happened to this group of people and then....the end.<br /><br />Aside from that it had some good visuals, spooky moments, and good acting. The potential was there for it to be a lot more than it was.

B003UESJFG|5.0|Will Ferrell is best known for overplaying his roles. The results don't work for everyone in his live movies, though I for one tend to laugh at lot at his movies no matter how bad they sound before I see them. LOL<br /><br />MegaMind, however, is a role that HAD to be overacted, and Ferrell comes through with a perfect performance that provokes a wide range of emotions in the viewer.<br /><br />The rest of the voice talent is also well performed. Tina Fey is great as the \\"Lois Lane\\" role reporter, and Brad Pitt performs solidly in his rather brief role as MetroMan.<br /><br />The entire movie is, of course, a Superman parody, right down to a facsimile of Brando as Superman's father, as MegaMind is trying to groom his \\"new hero\\". However, in this superhero plot line, the evil villain eventually wins, then suffers through the reality that without the hero to contend against, there's no fun left in his life. Things go wrong when he tries to create a new superhero to fight, and suddenly he experiences a rather strong need for a role reversal.<br /><br />The movie is highly amusing and very touching at times. As animated parodies of this type must to succeed, it does a great job of touching on familiar themes and scenes from comic books ... very similar the the success achieved by \\"The Incredibles\\", which has long been among my personal favorites of the \\"later day animated films\\". As in that film, the gadget \\"cool factor\\" is threatening to burst the top off of the charts.<br /><br />The film is very suitable for family viewing, and I highly recommend it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I enjoy many kinds of novels and am not a prude.  This is superficial, immature, repetitive and btw, not hot.  I heard the second in the trilogy was the best one, so I forced myself to finish the first one, but I could not finish the second one.  I never thought I'd skip over the sex parts of a book to look for something more interesting but that's what happened.  If you want a really interesting novel that also has hot sex try Diana Gabaldon's Outlander.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|plays well on kindle. great artwork. makes me wonder how long it will stay fun. reminds me of facebook games.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|What an involved read. I was drawn into each of the characters...feeling what they felt, seeing what they saw. Can't wait to get moving to the next one!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this app! It is so fun, exciting, and over all, wonderful.  I recomend this app to anone who likes to have fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you are looking for just your basic version of solitaire (like you would find on your desktop) this is what you are looking for. Nice design and easy UI. Ads are minor and relatively unobtrusive. Would highly recommend.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|This has absolutely no innovation and was a terrible waste of time. Remember the movie the terrible movie prince of persia? It is that movie exactly except on mars.
B002PEP4SC|2.0|I checked this out from the lending library and am very glad I didn't pay for it. I found Rook rather irritating. Heat constantly told him to stay put while she went to do things, and he always popped up. She always seemed surprised and nettled that he didn't do as she said. So why did she continue to tell him he couldn't go with her and then be surprised again when he showed up? I read this on vacation so it didn't seem like a waste of time. I won't be reading any more in this series. Love the lending library!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best game in the world. I love it. Some of the games are hard to beat !
B007JM4CWY|4.0|This is an interesting puzzler that combines bits of logic puzzle, with soduku, and creates digital pictures as you complete it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this app it is so fun to play! thanks makers of this game I love this! this is a need 2 get app! also I like scrat kicking those fish so cute!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Before purchasing this pen, I read reviews and a word that kept popping up was \\"durability\\". If you're older than 12 then cast that word aside. It's plenty durable to do what it's supposed to. Just watch the pen nib and the piece that covers the screw to open te battery compartment.<br />My wife and I are avid Doctor fans. When we saw the SS we knew what to get each other for Mother's/Father's Day even though we don't have kids. As soon as mine came in, I ripped open the package, put the batteries in, and started zapping every lock and electronic that wouldn't work. It hasn't yet unlocked doors and the bum electronics still don't work. But it's an awfully good pen. Writes amazingly. Just watch the nib as it does have a tendency of wiggling out with extensive writing.<br />I take it to work and as a salesman it's a great conversation piece.<br />The UV ink is fun to play with and my 8 year old brother and 5 year old nephew can vouch for that.<br />This should be a definite buy for any DW fan.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|Sure there have been other movies in the past where people have had telekinetic powers.  But like this?  No, there is not another movie out there in its genre that can compare to this one!  Yes, there is a kid using his camera to film his life and the whole thing.  I kind of liked that touch to it myself.  A lot better than the Blair Witch Project, if you remember that movie.  This movie puts a whole different aspect on being superhuman.  I rented it to watch it the first time, but I am definitely going to buy it to add to my home collection.  Don't mind all the critics on here.  This is one of those movies that you need to watch for yourself to find out if you will like it or not.  What are you doing still reading this review?  Go ahead!  Watch the movie already. lol
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is addicting in the sense that it keeps you playing to open that next game. good time waster
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This was a great buy, it keeps my Kindle safe and clean.<br />If you buy a Kindle, you should buy this item too..Looks great too, just like a book..
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game. Can't stop playing it. I love creating little animal families and playing the mini games. Definitely recommend this game.,
B0086700CM|5.0|finally they get some good games on kindle fire! when i first started playing temple run it waz frustrating. but the controls are simple. you just have to learn how to time when to jump or go under etc. very happy to see this game is free!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|A must have! I love the different plans you can choose from! plenty of different versions. I just wish there wad a downloable NIV
B004UNX1LS|1.0|this app was not created for the kindle fire.<br />they should create one for the kindle fire specifically. this app was created for a phone not for the kindle.
0439882826|5.0|I am always intrigued by the clever paper engineering of pop up books and this one is absolutely superb. I already have other books by Reinhart and Sabuda - they are unbeatable. This one, however, tops them all. I love Star Wars anyway and the genius of Reinhart combined with the fun of Star Wars makes this book a 'must have'.The quality of the art work, as well as the intricate engineering, is excellent. Each scene unfolds dramatically and presents a complete 3D view - with even more scenes to unfold within each page. I 'play' with this for ages and am fascinated by the engineering. The grand finale of the last page alone makes the book most desirable. What excellent value for money too!
B007MJKOY4|4.0|I enjoyed the nuanced performances, particularly by Mr. Oldman. I suspect, however, that the byzantine plot and unwieldy interplay of characters might seem convoluted, if not abstruse, to film viewers completely unfamiliar with the novel and new to Le Carre or the Cold War espionage genre. I hope I'm wrong. The film deserves wider appreciation for its performances and for tackling a difficult storyline.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is jam packed with tons of fun and interesting games and that is why I freaking love it!!!

B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you like the classic Mario game then you will love this game. this game has the same concept of Mario only your a lepracon. it pretty addictive.  really fun!!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Got this book for my 12 year old. He read it in three days. He loved it. He can't wait to get the next one in series.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all 3 books and they where great. My husband read them as well and loved them. The only reason they would b bad is if u don't like love stories. Was traffic but very sexy.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so fun. It really feels like I am running my own town. The graphics are absolutely amazing. I will continue to play this game as long as possible.
B007IQX1G4|4.0|Theron shows her talent in depth that is unexpected for me as before this film I saw her as a shallow comedic beauty. Patton Oswalt, as a high school outsider who forms an unlikely alliance with the adult Theron, shows that his character is actually on par with Theron on many levels. They play off each other in an effortless manner and an unlikely, but surprisingly likely, alliance is formed. Oswalt is the one person who Theron can really be herself with, and I loved this movie as a result of not only her actions but her relationship with him.  Her final acceptance of him really.  I relate to Theron's character on a personal level so perhaps that kinship is a major part of why I give this movie such high praise-I identified- but on so many levels it shows the aftermath of being hung up on popularity, beauty and the arrogance that comes with not understanding the reality that life is more than just being part of the \\"in\\" scene. For those that are looking for a lighthearted frothy comedy, keep looking.  If you are looking for a funny and remarkably sad take on reality in a fresh change of pace, this movie rocks.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game has good graphics and easy to grasp.  I can solve each puzzle at my own pace.  It has plenty of levels of challenges.
0553386794|1.0|1) The author does NOT write well, in my opinion. The book is filled with clich&eacute;d phrases meant to take us back to the Middle Ages: \\"lady wife\\", \\"lord father\\", \\"mummer's farce\\", \\"call the banners\\", \\"leathers\\" and \\"silks\\" when referring to items of clothing, \\"smallclothes\\" for underwear, the list goes on..... The sheer repetition of these phrases took away from my enjoyment of the book. Also, the book is far too long.<br /><br />2) When referring to the male contribution to sex (or, more often, rape), the penis is the \\"sex that hangs long and heavy\\" and male prowess is achieved in just three thrusts. Ugh.<br /><br />3) George R. R. Martin's imagination as to architecture and coats of arms (which he calls \\"sigils\\") is remarkable. Unfortunately, Martin's mind is immature and he gives no thought to the infrastructure that has to support everything from castles to roaming armies. One castle is so high up in the mountains that it takes climbing and elevators to reach it: how does this protect the farmers and herders around it? The roaming armies assemble when there is a \\"call for banners\\" but there is no description of the supply chains necessary. Only the leader of an evil army \\"burns as he goes.\\" In short, these are the imaginings of a pubescent teen, and a very sexist one.<br /><br />4) The author hates women, does not understand sex as adults do, punishes the girly girls in the book by making them stupid, promotes the marital rape of a 13-year-old, who then falls in love with her husband-rapist in a Stockholm Syndromey way, and allows children of 15 and 13 to lead armies, while the 7- and 4-year olds are told to grow up to full adulthood.<br /><br />To summarize, I find George R. R. Martin creepy, sexist and immature. When I read that he frequents the fantasy conventions, I was not surprised in the least. When I learned he's had a girlfriend (whom he only recently married) for thirty years I WAS surprised, and very disgusted with what I imagine is their sex life. When I saw a picture of George R. R. Martin: a fat man with a bad haircut and a scraggly beard, wearing some sort of cap, and in black satin for a black tie party, well... he's a nerd. No surprise there.<br /><br />The man is a sexist obsessed with pedophilia, violence against women, and I believe he'd be happiest at a tacky Medieval Fair.<br /><br />Please don't waste your time. Watch the series, which captures the beauty of George R. R. Martin's fantastical architecture, and read something else.<br />Edit this post   Permalinkn I saw a picture of George R. R.

B0086700CM|4.0|its another endless runner but has its own style and unique gameplay. its not the best game out there but is definitely worth downloading for the low price of $0.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|game was fun. you can just let it run and come back days later.  creative characters and locations.  could g a little faster.
B0086700CM|3.0|I am from Ireland and I have a kindle fire how do I get the apps on to this in Ireland?
B007CBEO20|3.0|Once you get past the dull first track, which seems to be the recycled craft of a previous Europe's song (Run with the Angels) and the boring unecessary masturbatory Led Zeppelinesque tribute with \\"Drink and a smile\\", the album is very symmetrical and consistent. No singles here! which is interesting. The sonic qualities on this one are not as dynamic and expressive as on Start form the dark or Secret Society, it rather sounds very muffled...no loud grinding guitars and where are the keyboards by the way? Most of the tracks seem to be B-sides from the last album but that doesn't mean it is a bad album. The track \\"Bag of bones\\" might as well be one of the precious gems on the band's overall catalog. It is a great great well crafted song. It is an enjoyable listen from start to end though this one seems to be a depart from the last previous efforts in some ways. The sonic qualities are the missing link here...The expressive drums and churning bass sound are somewhat missing here, Joey's vocals are not as emotional (though the no-sense lyrics are still there - \\"would swedish people really born on the shadow of Kennedy\\"?... ) and Norum's classic over the top riffs are obviously not here in this album. There is the inclusion of a session drummer, extraordinaire Anton Fig which seems to be odd? Maybe the influence of a producer that did not had a good effect in a band's creative and personal work? The album is good, it is a grower. Having said that, this one will be essential to have for Europe fans and might be interesting for people that are not very familiar witht he band. It will be interesting to see where the band goes from here as they had a bundle of great albums (and great album cover art)since their comeback but the gears seemed to have changed with this one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it a fun way to pass time kids like the games so far no problems with any of the games

B0063IH60K|5.0|Absolutely a fun game very relaxing! I could play for hours and not even realize it! My husband and I are always competing to see who can get the fastest time.
1439102813|5.0|Wow! This book is so realistic and, for me, a real tear-jerking read. I teach high school and I have always told my students that if a book can draw you in, make you live vicariously through a character, and somehow help you with life experiences, then it's a good book. This book did that for me and so much more.<br /><br />Still Alice was informative about early-onset Alzheimer disease and its subsequent progressive loss of everything we take for granted: linguistic ability, thought processes, simply recognizing people we love. I don't want to give away too much, but I LOVED this book.<br />I am going to live everyday as though it is my last, because it could be my last the way I currently know and live it. I am going to read every book I want while I have the ability, memorize every little nuance of my children's and grandchildren's faces, and perhaps write things in a journal to jog my memory for later days (and probably for today and tomorrow)!<br />Read this book!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|ok<br /> game but time consuming with little climax don't like that energies are based on mostly time itngets somewhat boring
0345803485|3.0|Entertaining but not the greatest book ever written.  It was interesting but didn't live up to the hype for me.  Not really interested in finishing the series.
B007CGLRWA|4.0|Good multi-faceted movie...shows the personal, human side of educators and just enough insight into the students. Phenomenal performance from Adrien Brody.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|Joe's been away for nearly 20 years as far as his solo career but finally returns with a bang on \\"Analog Man\\" an album with some of his strongest material in years. Although he's an analog man, he's working in a digital medium here and co-producer Jeff Lynne compliments Walsh. When Lynne works with an artist and material strong enough, his production style doesn't truly overwhelm the artist and that's the case with Walsh here as it was with Tom Petty (although it does have that distinctive Lynne flavor to it with the tight arrangements and production touches). If you're not a fan of Lynne's production style you may want to listen to samples first to,see if this will appeal to you.<br /><br />From the title track of the deluxe edition to the final track (a reunited James Gang playing with Little Richard who sings lead vocals). The material is largely strong and although he might poke fun at himself for being an old fart once too often in some of the lyrics, but it's largely endearing and Walsh brings his characteristic sense of humor into play incorporating it into some pretty serious observations as well.<br /><br />The music is, as always, excellent throughout and Walsh collaborates with friends old (Ringo, Kenny Passarelli, Graham Nash, David Crosby)and new(Tommy Lee James, Rick Rosas).<br /><br />The deluxe edition has two additional tracks the humorous \\"Fishbone\\" and the previously mentioned track with his former partners in crime The James Gang and Little Richard on \\"But I Try\\". We also get a DVD with three live tracks (with Jeff Lynne as a guest performer--a rarity to see him performing live these days) \\"Analog Man\\", \\"Wrecking Ball\\" and \\"Lucky That Way\\" (the first three tracks off the album).<br /><br />For fans it's well worth picking up the deluxe for the additional tracks--the last track in particular with The James Gang and Little Richard kicks butt and the live DVD even though it only contains three performances, is also worthwhile.<br /><br />Recommended for long time Walsh fans.for long time Walsh fans.
B004LWZW6U|4.0|If you go into this wanting to take it seriously you're going to be disappointed but if you go into it knowing your going to get an over the top feeding frenzy of gore, humor and nonsensical characters then it's all good.<br />This Piranha even out does it's predecessor in my opinion as far as camp value and some OMG moments..<br /><br />If your a guy or even a girl you're going to love the amount of bare breasts and skimpy swim suits that are featured this time around.<br />The Fish are bigger, meaner,hungrier and smarter in 3DD so a word of advise,don't Go near the water.<br />Not even a pool is safe as this time the piranha have adapted to chlorinated water and wreak havoc in a water park getting ready for their grand opening.David Hasselhoff kicks in some comic relief as the special guest and star attraction for the water parks grand opening.<br />The effects are cool and the carnage is plentiful.Be ready to lol and get grossed out all at the same time..Gotta love it.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I've been watching Trek for 40 years, so I loved the premise of this novel. And from what I've read of Scalzi (my favorites being Old Man's War and Agent to the Stars), I thought that if anyone could bring that premise to life in delightful and fulfilling ways, it would be him. Unfortunately, I don't think he entirely succeeded. If you're a Trek fan, you will recognize how carefully Scalzi analyzed the entire Redshirt phenomenon, coming up with a set of rules and expectations that afflict the characters of this novel. However, the novel, while entertaining, left me feeling a little let down.  There were several significant plot developments toward the end of the book that abruptly and uncermoniously dumped me out of my willing suspension of disbelief. Also, while Scalzi has a gift for energetic, glib and entertaining dialogue, in this book he falls victim to a problem I usually see with less experienced writers - his characters all speak with the same voice, making it difficult to distinguish between the characters and making it hard to keep track of who is saying what, and ultimately impossible to really care about who's talking and what they're saying.<br /><br />I'm giving this book three stars, because that's the lowest rating I'll give to a book I've willingly read all the way through, even if I did so while hoping the entire time that it would somehow improve as I progressed. Sadly, it that wasn't the case.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app the kids play it in the car all the time. And it was free. thumbs up!
B007MDB71O|5.0|DONT WASTE YOU MONEY ON THE BLUE RAY/dvd SET (2 DISK SET)....Dont bother buying this 2 disk set. The advertising on AMAZON is deceptive as it lists multiple extra features but fails to mention that all the extras are on the BLUE DISK ONLY and the DVD version only has one documentary. Just buy the DVD disk only set
B007KWD7BK|5.0|When it comes to an album like Dopesmoker, one cannot just listen to such an album. This is one of those album that has to be experienced by the person. Whether aided by a green narcodic or not, this album takes you on a trip(p). It's not overly complex, but it's no easy feat either. A single song that clocks in at one hour, three minutes and thirty-four seconds. Just the thought of a band playing ONE song for that long boggles the mind. But what Sleep accomplished with this, whether for breaking down barriers, slight self-indulgence, or just a giant middle finger to the record company and anyone who said otherwise(or maybe a little of them all). But the road to hearing Dopesmoker as it is today in 2012 is almost as long as the journey feels whilst listening to the album.<br /><br />After signing to a major label and recording the ground-breaking Holy Mountain, Sleep went on to begin recording what would be their most ambitious musical project: Dopesmoker. Just the idea of an hour-long song sent the record company in frenzy, but the band and original producer Billy Anderson went on and tackled the project and succeeded. But when it came to release the album, the record company refused. London Records engineer David Sardy was sent to remix the album, but by this time the band had broken up and the interest in even releasing the material was up in the air with the band itself. When it was said and done, the album was released in 1999 under the name Jerusalem and featured six title tracks clocking in at 52 minutes. Fan appreciated finally hearing the tracks, but soon word came about the album and how it came to be and many wanted to hear the oringinal, untainted verion of Dopesmoker. After a few years, original producer Billy Anderson contacted the band with an offer to do the album properly, as they intended it to be heard. All for it, the band released the full-length, un-touched version of Dopesmoker, titled Dopesmoker, in 2003. Fans and the band were happy to finally hear the album the way it was went to be heard, and heralding the band for their ambition and groundbreaking achievement in recording the album.<br /><br />Now the album has been released, again, under a new label and with new art work. It has been remastered and cleaned up for the best audio and also includes a live bonus track of Holy Mountain recorded at the I-Beam, San Francisco 1994. If you never heard of Sleep, or heard of their infamous legacy behind this particular album, this is a perfect opportunity to experience this album and band. Also check out Holy Mountain, which is a bit easier to swallow compared to Dopesmoker. Be prepared for a dirge of lifetime, and the definition of 'Magnum Opus'.ly hear the album the way it was went to be heard, and heralding the band for their ambition and groundbreaking achievement in recording the album.<br /><br />Now the album has been released, again, under a new label and with new art work.

B0063IH60K|1.0|Ads are too much.  I would rather pay than have videos stream and my phone vibrate.  Very intrusive.  Not good.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This album is is their best yet and that's saying a lot because their last album \\"Halestorm\\" was fantastic. This is raw and hard and Lzzy's vocals are super impressive! A few of my most favorites from this album are, \\"I Miss the Misery\\", \\"Rock Show\\", \\"Beautiful With You\\" & \\"Break In\\". This is the kind of music we need these days and they are definitely underrated but I'm glad to see they are starting to get some recognition finally! I'm definitely a Halestorm fan for life and my love affair with them started back in 2005 when I saw them in concert with Trapt and I bought their EP off of Arejay (the drummer) & he walked me to my car & tried to kiss me...lol..but that's a story for another day.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|For those of us wanting to know why people do what they do, and more importantly, how to understand why we ourselves do what we do, this is a very good explanation. The text is illuminated by example after example from a cross-section of types of situations. It is an easy read, but not condescending for readers with a brain.  Overall exactly what I wanted when I purchased this book. I will most likely read it again.

0374275637|4.0|The Kahneman/Tversky corpus is for the most part descriptive. Hopefully we will be more cautious in our intuitions after immersing ourselves in their ideas. Left wanting is a \\"toolkit\\" to use for problem solving.<br />Only briefly is Polya mentioned in this current text (and not at all in the Judgement Under Uncertainty text).<br />So, we need a normative approach to problem solving. We need to know the risks and benefits of our intuitions.<br />In [[ASIN:4871878309 How To Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method]]<br />Polya offers an approach that has reach far beyond mathematics, which explains why this book is still in print more than 50 years after initial publication.<br />So don't let the title of Polya's book mislead you.<br />Run,don't walk, and purchase the Polya text.<br />Amazon should sell the 2 items as a box set.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I think most readers know the bare bones of this book and its main characters - supposedly written as fanfic based on the Twilight books (never read them, and don't intend to), and was eventually picked up by a big publishing house. I could have sworn big publishing houses had things called editors, but the version I read was filled with geographical errors (more on that later), along with endless repetition (I was ready to kill that \\"inner goddess\\" just to shut her up). I've noticed some reviewers comment on British-isms being used, but I really didn't pick up much on the Kindle version I got from my library.<br /><br />Anastasia (Ana) is a young college student in Vancouver Washington who meets Seattle billionaire Christian Grey during an interview for the school paper. Why sophisticated Grey is hot for clumsy Ana (she falls right into his office), is a mystery, but he's hot for her and she's not exactly unwilling - but Christian has a dark side and first she's got to sign a lengthy contract agreeing to his terms and conditions.<br /><br />\\"15.21 The Submissive shall accept whippings, floggings, spankings, canings, paddlings, or any other discipline the Dominant should decide to administer, without hesitation, inquiry, or complaint.\\"<br /><br />This is what's being published and promoted as romance? Ana and Christian have SEX (with the emphasis on the \\"F\\" word), they do not make love. Supposedly there's a dark secret from Christian's past that has brought about his sexual tastes and controlling nature, but that is still no excuse for abusing others. Erotica is a genre I don't typically read, but all the online chatter got me curious, and since the library had copies on kindle I just couldn't resist taking a look when my turn came up, especially because of the Seattle setting - my hometown. It's always fun to see how the locale is portrayed by those who've never been here. How did James do? You be the judge.<br /><br />Written in the first person narrative, the story begins as Ana tells us about her big day heading to Seattle from Vancouver to interview the mysterious Christian Grey:<br /><br />\\"ROADS ARE CLEAR as I set off from Vancouver, Washington, toward Interstate 5.\\"<br /><br />First off, no one but no one says \\"Interstate 5\\". It's I-5. Second, if someone is driving from the Portland/Vancouver area the only practical route is I-5, so it isn't necessary to mention the road one is travelling on - just tell the inner goddess that you're hopping on the freeway. Jeez (another word Ana uses to death).<br /><br />\\"Beyond that, there is a floor-to-ceiling window with a view of the Seattle skyline that looks out through the city toward the Sound. It's a stunning vista, and I'm momentarily paralyzed by the view. Wow.\\"<br /><br />So, look up skyline in the dictionary and/or images of the Seattle skyline. Just how do you think you are going to see that from the window of one of many tall buildings in the downtown core? I'm sure Grey had a lovely view of Mount Rainier or Puget Sound and the Olympic range, but the skyline? I think not.<br /><br />Now we have Ana leaving Seattle after her interview with Grey:<br /><br />\\"AS I LEAVE THE city limits behind...While cruising toward Interstate 5...\\"<br /><br />Ummm, I-5 (not Interstate 5) runs right through the city. While it is possible to get out of the city limits heading south on secondary roads, it's not very practical time-wise and those not familiar with the industrial/port area would be hopelessly lost. One would get on I-5 (not Interstate 5) right from downtown, and trust me, one does not \\"cruise\\" in downtown. One sits at one red light after another trying to negotiate turns after the hordes of pedestrians have cleared the sidewalks.<br /><br />\\"I can't remember the address. It's in the Pike Market District.\\"<br /><br />Sigh. That would be Pike Place Market.<br /><br />\\"Portland disappears in front of us as we head into U.S. airspace.\\"<br /><br />Portland, Oregon has a different airspace than the rest of the country?<br /><br />\\"I think we're moving from Portland's airspace to Seattle International Airport's.\\"<br /><br />It is simply Sea-Tac. Everyone knows it's an airport and everyone knows it's an effing international airport. I'm not even going to touch on flying the helicopter amidst the downtown skyscrapers...<br /><br />\\"We speed up Interstate 5...as Taylor whisks us into the night toward Bellevue.\\"<br /><br />Grey's condo is supposedly in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. Google maps and see which direction on I-5 (not Interstate 5) you need to drive to catch I-90 to Bellevue.<br /><br />In the end, this is definitely not the book for me. I don't mind a bit of sex, although I'm in the less is more camp, but I prefer it when there's some real love and chemistry between a pair and not just sex for sex's sake. Top that off with one of the most annoying narrators ever (seriously, she talked like a young, vapid teenager and not a college grad), I really can't find much of anything good to say about this. Except that at times it was so bad it was funny :Dirspace than the rest of the country?<br /><br />\\"I think we're moving from Portland's airspace to Seattle International Airport's.\\"<br /><br />It is simply Sea-Tac.

0439813786|4.0|I'm not going to bother with a summary of the book since there are so many people out there who already know of the book because of the accolades it has earned and the movie about it.  So rather than bore you with those types of details, I will tell you what I liked about this book, and what I didn't like.  The list of didn't like is MUCH smaller than what I did like.  And here's why:<br /><br />1 - the pictures. They were all captivating and really continued the story.  You knew exactly what was happening.  You felt the tension - and not a single word graced the page.<br /><br />2 - the overall design of the book had a great feel to it.  The pages didn't always start at the top and finish at the bottom.  This usually happened in times where the plot was getting good.  Set up a mood to the text.<br /><br />3 - this wasn't just a reading experience.  Like the main theme in this book - this was more like watching a movie, and having an overall visual experience.<br /><br />4 - it is a fast-paced book, full of things happening so people of all ages can jump into the story and stay there.<br /><br />What I didn't like as much.  I wish there HAD been more words.  I was really enjoying the story and I guess I just wanted more.  Selznick had me captured in his tale, and I wanted more details, more action, more history on... Well, everything.  Not sure how he could have put more pages in the book, but I would have been happy if he had.  I think the only thing too that I wanted in this book was a bit more of an ending.  I guess I like to know how everything was wrapped up, and while there was a good closing to it, again, I just wanted more.  :)<br /><br />I will recommend this to anyone who is looking for something different to read.  It is fun, and a great little escape from the world.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a terrific app and recommended by one of my son's preschool teachers. It's pretty funny watching them try to figure out how to cut the rope and be able to get the food to the little guy.<br /><br />My 5 year old enjoys showing us how he clears different levels. It's a fun game and probably #2 behind Angry Birds for them.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder is a very well written book that actually kept me in a constant state of wondering what would happen next.  The book's ending felt a bit abrupt to me but when you take into consideration that it sets the world up and then takes the main plot to a point that sets up for more books it actually makes sense.  I don't want to talk about the actual events of the story because I don't want to give away any spoilers but needless to say, this isn't your typical cinderella story and that is a damned good thing.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like that this game challenges you to beat your own high score and even your friend's! I have to watch my brother and sister a lot, so I just let them play this game to keep them entertained! Hope you enjoy this game as much as I do!

0385342063|5.0|If you are a fan of Sophie Kinsella's work, you should like this one too, since it's another fun tale featuring her trademark brand of comedy that involves her heroines going about things with the best intentions, but getting themselves into impossibly embarrassing scrapes (and somehow managing to save the day as well!)  So, nothing groundbreaking here, just Kinsella's consistently clever wit. I listened to the audiobook and really enjoyed it, and there were many parts where I laughed out loud. I love nearly all of her books (the Shopaholic series fell apart for me after couple books because Becky was always learning lessons only to repeat the same mistakes in the next book) and this one was no exception. I recommend it to anyone looking for something light and funny.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Through eight seasons, \\"24\\" was easily the most riveting show on television; surprisingly quality for the usual mindless fare presented on the \\"boob\\" tube. Season eight of \\"24\\" holds the excitement and drama that the previous seven seasons were known for.  This is and was the best show on TV.  Some shows stick around too long, but even in season eight, \\"24\\" has twists and turns in the plot that leave your jaw dropping in amazement.<br /><br />Season eight begins with an all new CTU (in New York), with Jack Bauer in quiet retirement.  It changes drastically from episode one on!  The plot revolves around a terrorist plan to use fuel rods as a weapon on US soil.  There is constant intrigue involving the middle eastern country which purchased the fuel rods (the I.R.K.), the Russian sellers, and CTU desperately trying to intercept the transaction and stop deployment of the rods.  On the political front, there is intense pressure for the US to sigh a peace treaty with both Russia and the I.R.K.  President Allison Taylor faces her greatest moral challenge, and this becomes a major theme of the season.  Season eight also brings the surprising return of former disgraced President Charles Logan.  His \\"Nixon-like\\" character represents the worst of American power, dirty politics, and moral failure.  In contrast, the role of CTU analyst Chloe O'Brian represents the best qualities of loyalty, friendship, and intellect.<br /><br />My only criticism of this season is the tendency to turn Jack Bauer into a superhero character. The things he is able to accomplish on his own are simply too much to believe. That aside, this final season of \\"24\\" will leave you in tears, as we say goodbye to the best show on television. With the rise of the mindless reality shows on TV, one wonders if the industry has any interest in creating further quality television as exemplified in \\"24\\".<br /><br />kone
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. The three codas at the end add a lot, giving perspective the reader otherwise would not have on the story, but it would still be a great book without them.

B005F9CP7M|5.0|This is the album of hers that I would most recommend to people that aren't fans. I remember her saying something about it being her best one, and while it's not my favorite of hers, it very well may be her best. The songs are very ambitious, and they work. It has a great vibe throughout, and has an almost epic quality. She still sounds way better than other contemporary pop artists when she sings pop songs, but it's awesome that she isn't limited at all. If there is one thing her discography shows, it's that she can sing anything, and this album just solidifies that. What an addicting voice, I only wish she would tour America.
1451683405|1.0|Since we're totally, completely and utterly clueless about the source and nature of consciousness -- that mysterious phenomenon by virtue of which we can say \\"I\\" in our minds -- Sam Harris' conclusion that free will does not exist has no basis in logic.  Even worse, Harris seems almost to begin with the assumption that free will does not exist, and then proceeds with an interminable attempt to rationalize that assumption.<br /><br />I'll add a little bit of a blog here, since I'm interested in the subject of consciousness: First of all, some questions: \\"Why consciousness is even necessary?  Why is it useful from the standpoint of evolution? That is, what survival benefit does it confer?  From a survival point of view, why wouldn't we do equally well just receiving and reacting to stimuli in a totally automatic sort of way? -- like we assume a computer does.  It could be a pretty complex path between the stimulus and the reaction -- for example, a computer can play an excellent game of chess, but it's still completely automatic and \\"mindless\\".  I have no clue on this point.  But \\"Nature\\" does seem to have gone to quite a bit of effort surrounding its implementation of consciousness -- it's given us an elaborate internal \\"display screen\\", or in Microsoft Windows terminology, an internal \\"desktop\\", that allows us to speak with ourselves internally, to see images in our minds, and to \\"think\\".  So, obviously, there is an evolutionary benefit to incorporating consciousness into the design of creatures over a purely automatic, reactive design.  My own suspicion is that consciousness is just the simplest solution Nature has found to solve some sort of evolutionary problem.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I just downloaded the app...much better than the standard calculator on my htc. I love the history of your transaction. my htc doesn't have % sign. great app

B0006HBZXS|5.0|great movie. purchased this awhile ago as a gift for my husband. finally watched the movie and it was in perfect condition. I will recommend this seller and the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this is the best of the series. I can't wait for the movie!!  I just hope they have the same cast as the original. This author is spectacular!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting FOREVER fir kindle to get this game. now that its here you have to get it! flawless defiantly width it!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|About half way through I was getting a little anxious - the story is about to end. What am I going to do!<br />I got so caught up in these characters I did not want it to end.<br />It did not disappoint - the last few chapters did it for me.<br />Now that I know the characters better I will be re-reading this series. I think the second time will be even better.<br />I will know why Christain is reacting the way he does.<br />I am going to go back and add to my review for book one. If the sex is too much for you just skip those pages.<br />Please keep reading. There is so much more to this story than sex.. come on isn't that what most new relationships are, you can't keep your hands off each other.<br />Thank you for Fifty Shades.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty fun but the different levels cost to many points. I don't like the fact that some of them glitch or that there is too many ads... some of the other games are really stupid and not appropriate for child use
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is fun and funky. It helps pass the time and will bring a smile to your face.  If you're looking for a better way to spend a long meeting or car trip then this is the game for you.  Buy it if you know what's good for you!
B007U1FEJE|5.0|While not even close to being the body of work \\"Pet Sounds\\" is, I find myself being drawn into this album in much the same way I was with \\"Pet\\" some 45 years ago.  I've had the album for 4 days now, and I have played it at least 3 times.  And I am beginning to realize that this album may be the Beach Boys' (what is left of them...and who you consider a true Beach Boy) way of saying goodbye forever.  And it is so hard to let go of that whole mythical magical Southern California scenario that Brian Wilson alone invented some 50 years ago.<br /><br />With all that has transpired between surviving members - the lawsuits, the breakups, the fragmented pieces forming their own touring bands - it would seem almost miraculous that this album and the 50th reunion tour would happen.  Of course, one only has to think for a moment to realize the motivation.  The tour alone is expected to gross some 70 million dollars, and while the album won't be any huge commercial success by today's standards, it will certainly add to the coffers.  Ironically, the one who needs the money the least of all is the one with whom the tour and album would not have happened.<br /><br />I will always wonder what this album might have sounded like without the \\"Auto-tune\\", the most over-used, mis-used piece of technology ever invented. As a veteran producer/engineer, I know it when I hear it, and very single vocal track on this album has been auto-tuned to the max.  The sad thing about tuning something perfectly is is that when you do that, you lose the magical \\"shimmer\\" and warmth that human imperfection provides.  In today's music, a new standard has been set that seems to have completely stripped everything we hear of any 'humanity' whatsoever.  And as a culture, we have been 'dumbed down' to the lowest common denominator of music where every thing sounds alike and has been auto-tuned, compressed and smashed to death.  Couple that with the fact that music itself has simply become too easy to get andfor free.  When fine Chardonnay flows from our sink faucets, it will never again taste as good as when we had to pay for it and only drink it on special occasions.<br /><br />Poor Al....no writer's credits on anything, thus no writer's royalties.  Brian and Joe Thomas have written the bulk of the album's material.  Mike's one song sounds exactly like \\"Kokomo\\", his one big hit without Brian.  Some of the lyrics are a bit 'lightweight', but then again, we listen to the Beach Boys just to hear those harmonies and to be transported back to better times.<br /><br />Getting back to the vocals - the signature of this band and Brian's trademark - the arrangements are classic Beach Boys; rich, thick, and like no other group's in pop music history.  Given that most of these guys are pushing 70, the lead vocal performances are amazing.  Brian can no longer sing falsetto, but his regular chest voice still has that same pure tone and sonic identity.  Special mention needs to be made of Jeffrey Foskett, who's gorgeous falsetto voice is heard throughout the album.  Jeffrey is every bit as much a Beach Boy as any of the rest of them for what he has contributed to both Brian and the band over the last 30 years.<br /><br />So....get this album.  Save for Capitol's continuous repackaging, it may be the very last of America's band to ever be heard again.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Just like micro off. All you have to do is start your project on office suite, plug your fire or whatever into a com. and upload it from it to the computer and continue working on it. Extremely convenient! Course, i did see it a month or two before i downloaded it and then i saw it drop to 99 cents and instantly bought it. very impressed with the results!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Overall, very fun game. You can accumulate coins fairly quickly, always more than one goal to achieve. Wish there were more opportunities to accumulate acorns for to purchase animals and families that require acorns rather than coins, or maybe buy acorns with coins?? Just a thought. But, at least you can play this game without spending real money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am greatful for a multi-facetted app that has all the differant versions of the one true book. The ability to read two seperate readings, side by side is very helpful.

0375850864|1.0|the chapters are very short - just two pages or so, not enough to sink my teeth into.  the plot meanders wildly in a \\"so what?\\" kind of way.<br /><br />i realized early on that the author was smacking me in the face with clue after clue, but the way it all came together at the end was unsatisfactory, a dirty dishwater let down.<br /><br />it stinks of the kind of book that english teachers get thrilled about which they then ram down a student's gullet.  english teachers love, for example, the forced symbolic metaphor of the veil everyone lives behind.  it left me sayin' \\"meh.\\"<br /><br />if you enjoy this kind of sci-fi mystery lite, more power to you.  it bored me.
B005HSL626|3.0|very fun and addictive but very mindless as well no strategy whatsoever. Definitely. a must have for little kids my little bro. loves it.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|How a talent that created Phantom of the Opera could turn out Love Never Dies is amazing.  To even speak of this trash as a follow up to Phantom is unbelievable.  The author is a man of great talent and does not seem to realize that a one song musical just doesn't make it.  This failure is further degraded by an attempt to<br />follow up on the Phantom legacy.  If you are a fan of Phantom don't see this dribble.<br />Richard Fandel
B0079J28NW|5.0|I saw Yellow Submarine when it was released in the theater.  I was 10 years old.  I had never seen anything like it.  It really moved me.  I owned the tape and I owned the DVD but both of those fell flat.  The colors were washed out and on the tape \\"Hey Bulldog\\" had been removed.  This release brings back all those memories of that 10 year old kid sitting in the theater seeing it for the first time.  The audio mix is first rate.  The colors are vibrant.  Finally!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Absolutely terrible writing!  Hard core BDSM porn with an anemic plot stringing sex scenes together.  Save your money.  For Gods sake dont buy the second and third books!

B000G73U5Y|5.0|Whenever I've heard a Steely Dan song come on the radio, I'd say to myself \\"I should get some Steely Dan music\\" but never got around to it. FINALLY, the opportunity arose and I've played this CD constantly since it's arrival. It brings me back to the happy times in my life giving me the feeling of warm sunshine on my face on a beautiful spring day with nothing else to do but enjoy! I absolutley waited too long to get Steely Dan into my music library. Don't make the same mistake as me and aquire this music now.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is the best alien related movie made since aliens. I am not too hard on these movies i even like alien 3. I thought it had a creepy feel to it and the visuals were great. The plot was also very interesting and i really hope there is a sequel to this to show how the aliens evolved further.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I don't often fall in love with an album after one only listen, but Of Monsters And Men's \\"My Head Is An Animal\\" is a decided exception. And after 10 listens... oh, man, I'm completely hooked. Several reviewers have compared this group to Mumford and Sons (another one of my favorites). I don't think the style of music is the same, but they do both have a way of lifting up a song and bringing it to a high point that immediately puts you into your musical warm and happy place. You can't go wrong buying this album. Don't even think about it. Do it.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I like this knife overall. The Ka-Bar Becker BK2 has a simple sturdy design. All black with an all black sheath. The blade came sharp right out of the box. This full tang fixed blade looks strong. Thick 1/4 inch one-piece steel. The steel is 1095 which is a very popular knife steel but it is not stainless and will rust. The knife is made in the USA while the sheath is made in Taiwan. The handle scales are made of Grivory (trade name) which is a thermoplastic synthetic resin of the nylon family stronger than Zytel. Basically fiberglass reinforced plastic. You can buy Micarta replacement scales for this knife if you prefer them. I like the large lanyard hole at the butt end of the knife and the holes in the sheath for paracord tie-downs.    The one thing that could be improved is the sheath. The sheath is actually two parts. One part contains and holds the knife and does a good job holding the knife in place by friction. I thought I'd have to use two hands to remove the knife because it is held in the sheath so tight but then I discovered a small pressure point for your thumb (thumb brake) which when pressed against allows a one handed removal. Vertical carry would not be a problem as the knife will not fall out for sure. The second part of the sheath is where there is room for improvement. I like the way four screws are used to attach the two parts of the sheath together. But the belt loop nylon is just too loose and flexible. I wish this part of the sheath was more like the Gerber LMF II sheath which I also own. Much more rigid, it just feels stronger. For the money, I paid $62, this knife is a good value and should last a lifetime if used properly.    See reviews here:    [...]
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good, solid app with easy to use interface &amp; nice graphics. Very handy for keeping track of weather in multiple locations.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was very skeptical about reading the trilogy.  I had several friends insisting that I give them a try, & I am so glad I did!  I am normally a Patterson, Cornwell kind of girl, but these books held my attention every bit as much as one of those.  I flew through the series in less than a week!  Incredible story line, even incredibly funny at times!! Loved it!!!
B007NYODBS|3.0|Roman Polanski has gathered a brilliant cast, with a terrific concept, and yet produced what I think is probably one of his lesser films.. simultaneously feeling somewhat long (at only 79 minutes!) and yet not long enough to reach a more biting, effective and satisfying conclusion.<br />The movie takes place in one room, as two couples (from apparently reasonably wealthy backgrounds) meet to discuss an altercation between their sons, which resulted in missing teeth for one of them, after being hit in the face with a stick by the other.  It all starts with a great show of civility, as they each go to great lengths to remind each other that they are above such petty squabbles and as adults can reach a conclusion amicably.  However as time goes on (in real time) the restraint and cloak of civility worn by the characters slips away, and by the end we see the real gap between what they would like to be seen as, and what actually lies beneath.  The turning point comes half way through when the stress (or the cobbler..?) causes one to throw up, and this acts as a catalyst for the underlying true selves to be seen, almost as if the repression had the cork removed.<br />It is actually a wonderful concept, at least for those that like their `action' purely drive by people talking in a room.  However, although this was always going to be tough to make into a film, it's disappointing that Polanski has somehow accentuated the staginess of the play, rather than made the situation any more natural or at least cinematic.  This does distance you somewhat from the events taking place.  On the other hand, the performances from Winslet, Foster, Reilly and Waltz are all excellent.  They appear to be having a ball, getting their teeth into a role which allows the full range of emotion in a short space of time, perhaps too much so in some cases as they let their acting tics start to show and flag the characters coming development.  In the hands of these great actors though, we relish watching as the relationships develop from 4 people trying to agree, to two couples facing off against each other, disintegrating as alliances form and then fall apart between the various characters (with the aid of whisky and cigars), until each stands apart.<br />So although stagey, its meticulously put together and well acted.  Why only 3 stars? - because the sum of its parts, what it adds up to, is somehow at the end of the movie not quite enough to resonate as much as it could or should have, failing to surprise in a way which would have left its mark in the same way as, for example, [[ASIN:B0001P044Q An Inspector Calls [Region 2]]], or [[ASIN:B000I2JDEY Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].

B0059WTMLW|5.0|This is a good app. If you disable the data mining there is much to like about this.<br /><br />Consider this before you pass. The opening screen presents Open Feint and allows you to opt out! (Well, actually, to NOT opt in!)<br />Then, before the game is played, most people take a look at the settings. Right there, in plain sight, is Flurry Analytic's checked. Simply uncheck it!<br />It could NOT be easier. All this Sturm und Drang make people look silly! It is NOT all that! They are not mining for your credit cards nor are they forcing you to do anything!<br /><br />Really chubby people (uno the kind with Vienna sausage fingers)  can't afford a stylus because every dollar goes to food, or beer,  or bail.<br />The creativity is non-existent but the ego believes people want to read all the reviews. Delusions of Grandeur much?

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|The plot of this trilogy is very interesting.  The vulgar language did NOT make the books any better.  I probably will not read any other books from this author because of the language.

0439597404|5.0|After their parents the Grace children--teen Mallory and 9-year-old Simon and Jared--move with their mother into an old Victorian house owned by an aunt who lends it to them to stay in.  The children explore the house and find a secret library upstairs, and in this they find a field guide to magical creatures.  The children have various problems with an unseen creature which haunts them in the night-time, and they find a nest in the wall which clearly doesn't belong to a squirrel.  I won't tell you how it ends, but they find the owner of the nest in the library, and it opens a whole new world for them.<br /><br />This book is short, about 108 pages long, and it moves at quite a clip, so it keeps your attention.  There are delightful illustrations to show scenes from the story, and there's a little note at the beginning from the authors claiming that the story was given them by the Grace children themselves.  You can also find biographical notes about the authors at the end of the book.<br /><br />The Field Guide is a fun read.  The mysteries the book introduces are partly cleared up as the book progresses, but not everything is explained, so there's room for more explorations in the subsequent books of the series.  This compact little story should be a big hit with young readers, rewarding their efforts with lots of things going on and a strong sense of mystery that's only partly cleared up at the end.  I can attest that the book is a tasty morsel for adults as well, and I will be giving the series to my god-daughter in a few years, when she's old enough to be able to follow it along. Enjoy!

B007Z9RAX4|5.0|Enjoyed the movie a lot. The action scenes are good and the plot hangs together. The acting is solid but turn up the volume as it's a little quiet at times. It doesn't try to do too much and it isn't as showy as a lot of films, so some people I talked to wanted more explosions. Personally I want to see more movies like this because so often action movies force me to suspend my disbelief for most of the film. Watch if you want to see athletic people kicking arse and a reasonably happy ending.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, because while the run itself is fun and challenging,  there are also objectives to complete and perks to unlock, which makes me want to keep playing.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|It's a pass because all the IMAX scenes are missing. I saw this movie in IMAX and it was breathtaking, and I am missing that experience for some stupid reason.
B0086700CM|5.0|Really like this game. Very challenging for me my granddaughter has it to and she is much better at it.
B0080CL0HM|4.0|I'm glad I ordered this movie for 48-hour viewing rather than saw it in a theater, because the first time I watched it I was completely bewildered by the over-orchestration and disjointed scenes --- the movie seemed to me more like a collection of vignettes and unexpected flashbacks than a traditionally flowing movie, and I was reminded of the fact that this is the first film by a pair of directors who had previously worked only in the theater. However, even though I didn't watch the movie again all the way through, I re-viewed large sections of it, and found that the more I watched it the more I appreciated the acting and production values.<br /><br />This is definitely Rob Pattinson's movie - he's in every scene and nearly every frame of the film, and all the other characters are planets orbiting around him. If there are any emotions that he did not get to convey in this movie, I can't think of them, and I would imagine that making this film was a very intense experience for him. He \\"looks the part\\" in this period drama, but since his physical appearance is important to the character, there are elegant scenes where he could have used a shave and a shampoo; none of the other men in these scenes have greasy hair and a five-o'clock shadow, and it's an \\"eeew\\" factor that distracts from his otherwise amazing face.<br /><br />I loved the performances by Thurman, Ricci, and Thomas, because even though their characters behaved similarly to each other in the social scenes, they each broke down in a different way that really defined their characters. The other male characters were more ancillary, but also well-cast.<br /><br />The movie is visually beautiful, although as I mentioned earlier, the background music is way too much (and I'm a classical musician, so if anything, I should have enjoyed all the classically-oriented music). If you like period dramas, I would recommend this movie.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|The plot, characterization, and pacing are all excellent. I never felt bored, and always wanted to keep reading and find out what happened next. There's enough subplot and intrigue to make it feel like a book for adults, but not so much that I felt like I had to take notes.<br /><br />The author avoids the whiny, angsty, verbosely introspective hero we see so often, but perhaps a bit too well. There are a few sections in the book, especially the second half, where Vaelin almost becomes a silent protagonist. At one point, he's forced into a promotion and off his chosen path in life, induced to take on responsibilities he doesn't want--and we have little idea how he feels about it, aside from a short word as it was happening that he didn't want it to. The story is told almost entirely from Vaelin's point of view, but we sometimes go through long periods of time and momentous events with barely any idea of his thoughts of feelings. It struck me at one point, as he was performing a long-term duty for a blackmailer, that I had almost no idea as to the main character's motivations. Does he plan on being a pawn forever? Does he mind? Does he hate his life, or is he happy because he's with his companions? What gets him through the day, and does he have a plan for tomorrow? His strong emotional reaction and decision to follow Nortah north is almost a shock.<br /><br />While the story is great, the writing needs work; this is why I knocked off a star. You can't go two minutes without a missing comma, or a comma splice, or a misplaced apostrophe, or a missing or doubled or flat out wrong word. In a sixteen-hour book, that comes out to a lot of time rereading sentences to figure out what they should say. There are so many errors that it actually slows down the reading and breaks immersion. I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan, but you need to hire an editor. Your writing is holding your story back.<br /><br />Still, as a whole, this book is absolutely worth your time, and it's a steal at the price.<br /><br />Edit: Yeah, jim, really...<br /><br />If you don't know that there's an error on almost every page, then that's great, but I did, and it was a real problem for me, so I gave the book four stars. It's a good rating, so I don't think I'm tarnishing the rating of the book. If you read my review, you'd see I called it \\"excellent\\", \\"great\\", \\"absolutely worth your time\\", and \\"a steal at the price.\\" I don't see how that tarnishes the esteem of the book.<br /><br />Everyone makes mistakes, and I'm not asking for perfection. $30 books from big-name publishers and NYT bestselling authors have errors, too; when you've got 300k words and tens of thousands of punctuation marks, there are going to be some mistakes, and that's inevitable. That wouldn't keep me from giving a 5-star review.<br /><br />But this book is not possessed of extremely minor editing mistakes, that I had to LOOK for to find. On top of the (in my opinion, rather more than what was) inevitable errors, Mr. Ryan consistently makes the same errors with commas, and the errors with apostrophes came up often enough that I wondered if he was just guessing. There are about 10 rules for commas, and the author clearly doesn't know at least two of them. Those consistent errors are covered in the first 10 pages of every grammar book, and any editor would have caught them automatically.<br /><br />It is my belief that Mr. Ryan and his story are good enough that an editor is the biggest difference between his book and the ones from the big name publishers, that sell for five to ten times as much. I don't think it does the author any good for everyone to tell him he's perfect when he's not, when he's in fact so very close to being so much more. Find me another book with this many reviews and a 4.97/5.00 rating, that's 600 pages long and has a list price of $3 ($1.50 actual). It's tragic. He should hire some starving linguistics student from the local college for a couple hundred dollars out of pocket to be his editor, quintuple his price, and quit his day job.

B0059WTMLW|4.0|While I am reading that others are complaining about the open feint and other analytic software being installed, the program does give the user the ability to not use either. With open feint, it gives you the opportunity to use it or not right when you start the program the first time, with the flurry analytics, you have to go into the options to turn it off, but at least it gives you the option. Other than these two small issues, this is a full featured sudoku program and if you are a fan of sudoku, you owe it to yourself to download this.

Going opposite the herd is an oft heard phrase, but  one of the hardest things on earth to actually do, especially in light of the markets ability to  \\"remain irrational, much longer than I can stay solvent\\" That being said, this book gives insight, and therefore, the guts, to go out on that lonely limb.

1451627289|4.0|I am honestly hit or miss with Stephen King. While I loved Insomnia, I normally have trouble reading his books. I find that the level of detail he explores makes it challenging for me to follow his story line. I also normally take issue with how quickly a story turns from 'normal' to 'supernatural.' This book, however, was excellent! The characters were full and interesting; the story was engaging - and while it was detailed, it was detailed enough to give the flavor of the time/place without being overdone. I was interested in the story from the first to the last page. Great read, even for non-Stephen King readers.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very fun and easy to play.  I find myself playing for hours without stop.  however playing the game requires Internet connection, which I do not like.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book because of all of the fuss. I cannot believe such a poorly written book has gotten so much attention. Not only is the prose bad but the description of \\"making love\\" is terrible. The author does not describe making love, rather she talks about sex which is not very imaginative. I am an old man of 71 and could do much bettor both in the writing and the act.

I was particularly impressed with the author's patience and sensitivity in the face of delays, rebuffs, and disappointments--her own and the family's.<br /><br />I found I couldn't put this book down.

0307276902|5.0|I would like to note, despite the reviews for this book being more then \\"fiction\\", I am an avid reader whom read this book just for a good read. For whatever reasons that James Frey did to give himself bad publicity, this book is not going to change. It is what it is and A GOOD, FIRM, RAW, UNCUT BOOK, is what it is. It gives you great insight into understanding the world of an addict and his addictions feed into him. It also opens a window and showcases a very detailed idea as to how addicts think, feel, believe and emotions that ravage them when under the influence. Not all that is written in this book is true about addictions but at least the perspective gives the reader a good bird's eye view of James Frey as an addict.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Never disappointed with Adam's songs, I listen and then discover during the day the tunes playing around in my mind and making me smile.  No one has ever caused me to just smile when I listen.  Maybe it's because his voice is pure purity.  Or maybe he satisfies so many different genres on this album.  There is no need to go into detail since are so many lovely reviews already written.<br /><br />So, for me, (and I'm old) Trespassing gives me my temporary fill of pure music that takes care of so many different facets of my being.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
0345803485|3.0|Interested to read because of all the publicity it was given over the media.  As I read it, I couldn't see what all the hype was about, if you watch current movies or television lately this is all you see.  Mr. Gray was a sadistic masochist and he fell in love with a naive college graduate, who was willing and ready to try whatever he wanted to experiment with.  I would recommend this book to my friends, but, I probably will not read any sequels in the trilogy series.

I love being able to search for that verse that I can't remember where I read it. I like being able to follow along in church and take notes. I have used the listening feature. listening to someone read thr bible allows me to just close my eyes and meditate on the words being read. I am able to compare different translations. While I still like to read physical books, this app allows me to study the Word wherever I am!

B00003CXBK|5.0|This is an interesting film.  It's perhaps the most well known of all of Studio Ghibli's films in the U.S. and also Miyazaki's most mature, violent and serious film.  Thematically, it is most closely similar to his previous film, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, which also dealt with heavy environmental themes.  Unlike Nausicaa, which I felt was very one-sided, Princess Mononoke is a much more fair presentation of both the human side and the forest.<br /><br />The story follows Ashitaka, the prince of an obscure tribe of people who is cursed by a boar god-turned-demon.  He leaves the village to find the source of the boar god's curse, even though it's made clear that he doesn't have much hope of lifting his life-threatening curse.  From there, he discovers a war between the old forest gods and a settlement of iron workers...  What I really like about this film is that it presents a realistic portrayal of both sides.  Too often in environmentalist films humans are portrayed as pure evil and nature is always cute cuddly and good.  Princess Mononoke doesn't shy away from showing the vicious dangerous side of the forest and also both the good and bad points of the humans.  Lady Aboshi herself is both an antagonist who wants to destroy the forest to get the iron under it, but also a good person in her compassionate treatment of lepers and former brothel girls.  The film is sensitive enough in it's treatment of the issues that by the end you're not quite sure if either side is fully in the wrong.  That's the mark of a well-done story.<br /><br />As for the visuals, as per Studio Ghibli expectations, they are excellent.  Everything is crisp, bright and beautiful, and all movement feels fluid and natural.  I especially like the depiction of the demon god, as it's quite appropriately icky-looking.  I also love the little forest spirits and their rattling heads - they're quite cute!  Anyway, the music also feels appropriate although I can't say I noticed it much.<br /><br/>Princess Mononoke is a film that any Studio Ghibli fan should see at least once.  Just be forewarned that it isn't as sweet and G-rated as most of Miyazaki's other films and definitely is not for kids.  If you're not a fan of Studio Ghibli, then I'm sure you could still appreciate this film as an excellent piece of animation!<br /><br />P.S. - The 2000 DVD release comes with one special feature which is a little featurette with some interviews with the voice actors and other people who worked on the U.S. localization of the film.  It's pretty interesting stuff.
B004LROMWU|1.0|I found Falling Skies to be boring and completely implausible. Falling Skies is full of bad science and a terribly crafted narrative. The technology, tactics, and motives that the aliens use is laughable. Falling Skies is like watching an episode of 1960s Doctor Who without The Doctor or the Tardis.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|Went into this movie with caution from friends.  I have no idea why people didn't like this movie.  Other reviewers have addressed the strange criticisms of plot and character development.<br /><br />What are we comparing this to?  People absolutely hated this movie compared to what?  The Transformers?  Battleship?  Not even in the same universe.  How about some more beloved scifi?  Say, Firefly?  Less cliched, more imaginative, better cinematography... but no Josh Whedon... oh well.  So much the better in this case.<br /><br />Visually, in my mind, I kept comparing it to Star Wars Episode I, but of course with less cheese.<br /><br />Thanks to Burroughs, I think, the story is fresh in relation to modern sci-fi stories and very enjoyable.  Overall a great effort with above par acting (for sci-fi), good visually and entertaining to watch... and watch again.

0345803507|4.0|I agree with the numerous reviews stating how repetitive James is with her writing, but honestly how many different ways can you describe the process of getting turned on and having sex? Sure, it's not a masterpiece series and the hype will likely die down within the month but as with any review of a book, it's all subjective. If you are looking for a read that will let you escape the everyday \\"functional\\" relationship that you might be in, this is a good choice. Of course it is not realistic, James was playing to an audience of adults seeking an exciting read that stretches the sexual imagination without intimidating them with the reality of a BDSM relationship. The book isn't getting rave reviews for the author's literary genius, but rather for her ability to spice up some sex lives around the country with a rather innocent novel. Shallow plot, fantastical characters (which lets admit, who hasn't fantasized about being swept off your feet and f@&$ed like an animal by a richer than rich stud who is completely addicted to you?) and repetitive language aside, James got me wet where it counts - which I believe was her intent.

B001A4LYN2|2.0|Supposedly loosely based on the first 150 pages of Upton Sinclair's excellent novel Oil!, the only reason any credit is given are the dialogue taken directly from the book.  Beyond the aforementioned dialog, there is an overall similarity in setting and premise, but that nothing even come close to the book.<br /><br />The movie itself, though well acted, is long and tediously tied together in a series of drawn out scenes.  The phrase that pops into my mind about the film is Peter Griffin's analysis of The Godfather on The Family Guy, this movie \\"insists upon itself.  It seems the writer and director eschewed the idea of making a good movie in order to make a masterpiece, but in the process failed at both.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|This was a good film, but when compared to the breathless reverence that the woman who recommended it to me (an admitted comic nerd) uttered it with, it was sort of a letdown. She made it sound like it was the biggest thing since The Godfather, and while that may be true for comic nerds who have spent their life tucked away living in mom and pop's basement, it's not really as big a deal for the rest of us -- or at least, not for me.<br /><br />That's not to say it's a bad film at all. Once it gets rolling, it's quite good. I especially liked the Hulk and felt he was portrayed much more capably than Edward Norton's rendition from a few years ago. Some of the special effects are fantastic as well. And while the main baddies look like shameless ripoffs from Gears of War, they're still creepy and fun to watch as the good guys Hulk Smash them. Samuel L. Jackson is also superb, as is Scarlett Johannsen as Black Widow. There are some serious drawbacks, though. The film takes a looooong time to really get rolling, and only ardent comic geeks will appreciate the more obscure heroes (I had no idea Hawkeye was even a hero until about halfway through the film). And that's really the thing -- when taken for what it is, The Avengers is a fun, summer, popcorn film that caters capably to most, but most especially to geeks, and when compared to the high watermark introduced by Nolan's The Dark Knight, it doesn't hold up from a pacing or thematic standpoint. It also does not feature an Oscar-worthy performance by Heath Ledger (in fact, none of the acting in The Avengers is especially good, though props should be paid to Robert Downey Jr's excellent role as the snarky Stark, although at least The Avengers doesn't feature Christian \\"MouthFullaNails\\" Bale).<br /><br />I enjoyed the film. Just don't listen to all the fan-things try and tell you it's going to change your life and you will too. It's a perfect summer popcorn blockbuster with likable characters and huge amazing setpieces that no one will likely remember in 20 years, but what's wrong with that? For now, it's pretty damn good.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|This album could have been named Think About the Days, as I feel that's the overriding concept. As the BBs think about the days, which is a very thoughtful theme, they give expression to the need that the \\"good times never end.\\"  With its beautiful melodies first trying to hark back to the times as they were, it winds up in reality, that we can't go back.  Yet we can enjoy life as it is in the moment. -- Shelter<br /><br />Still and all we miss the old times, but as the suite grapples with the fact that after all, Summer's gone. Perhaps in the next two albums (we can always hope) Brian and his collaborators will sing about some of the other many things that make life so wonderful -- good times. Shelter has really grown on me, along with the suite, and Bill and Sue.<br /><br />Thank you Brian et al for making this happen!

B002U3CBZM|1.0|For me the most distinctive feature of this novel is not the gory storytelling referred to by many reviewers, but the relentless detailed description of every scene, every meal, every person and every piece of clothing.  These descriptions seem to serve very little purpose and do not advance the plotline at all.  I agree with many of the reviewers that the characters lack motivation for many of their actions moving from one pointless action to another, although this does not seem to bother many fans of violent fiction.<br /><br />I rarely fail to finish a book but gave up on this after 44% despite a concerted effort to finish a book that was strongly recommended by so many reviewers!  Don't waste your money, especially at this price!<br /><br />Finally I would like to comment on the fact that the earliest reviewers of this book seem to have supplied negative reviews, check the first twenty or so reviews and compare with the later reviews.  Odd how it improved as more people read it.

B000BQ7BX2|5.0|Gary Bertini was an Israeli conductor who really helped get great music-making off the ground in Israel; and he was active in Europe.  USA hardly knew him or heard him.  But this set is a welcome, serendipitous opportunity to hear just how extremely fine a music leader and orchestra builder this dark horse conductor truly was.  Bertini belongs in a special class of leaders whose global reputations never quite got to jet set marketing levels; but whose legacy of recordings suggest he was actually one of the great conductors after all.  Jascha Horenstein and Gunter Wand belong in this list of discerning dinner party invitations.  After listening to what Bertini conjures and cajoles so magically from his Cologne players, I am deeply and persuasively reminded of none other than Yevgeny Mravinsky in Leningrad.  Yes, the playing as well as the discipline of ensemble and symphonic line grasped and given out, whole, is just that good.<br /><br />So many musical things are so elegantly and incisively right about the Mahler this set brings us, that criticizing or questioning seem ungrateful and disrespectful.  There is simply no terrible moment in all eleven discs.  And that is saying quite a lot about high quality.  Not only the Cologne players are flying high, but also the choral groups are exceedingly vivid and strong, able to match the distinguished sense of line that the orchestra departments serve up in heaps of glorious playing.  And the soloists match the rest.<br /><br />Let's start w the second symphony.  I grew to love it, via the absolutely classic reading from Bruno Walter with Canada's great alto/mezzo Maureen Forrester in the solo parts.  For some unfathomable reason, SONY has now remastered that release in DSD, but not yet made it available in real time SACD, but put out something rather fake SONY likes to call blue spec CD.  (Yes, I bought it; the improvement clearly stems from the DSD remastering, not whatever the blue spec deal is claimed to be.  SONY needsto stop insulting its classical buyers, but that is a rant for another day?)  I also really liked Wyn Morris' second symphony; but to my knowledge, it has never been released on disc in PCM or DSD.  Add Bernstein with Dame Janet Baker to the solid gold shelf, and let's say that in his own ways, Bertini measures up.  His soloist is Florence Quivar, who surely is one of the most active current Altos who sings the second.  Her soprano colleague is Krisztina Laki, whose silvery voice offers precious metal contrast to Quivar's caramello-covered-with-chocolate tonal richness.  I've been a Krisztina Laki fan, ever since I heard her sing Haydn's Creation oratorio under the Kujken brother in a complete set on Accent which never gets the applause it dearly deserves.  For Bertini, Quivar and Laki are just as engaged and musical as one might wish.<br /><br />Gwendolyn Killebrew is the third symphony alto soloist.  My fav shelf marker is Jascha Horenstein's British singer, Norma Procter...., or others like Christa Ludwig, Janet Baker, Jessye Norman.  Killebrew does not quite have the utterly heavy, deep well voice that I like to hear in this work, but she is a genuine low female voice with sufficient heft that I don't feel slighted when we get to the Nietzsche midnight song.  Her way with the line matches Bertini in depth and lyrical poise.  (This solo is among the most nakedly exposed of Mahler assignments, and just standing up to sing it must show some courage, wherever, whenever?)  And Killebrew handles the Wunderhorn movement that follows in company with the womens' and boy's choruses just fine, too.<br /><br />Our fourth symphony soloist under Bertini is Lucia Popp.  She is by far among the best singers who take the last movement's Wunderhorn song on recordings.  I grew up with Schwarzkopf under Klemperer, and was blissed out by Margaret Price under Jascha Horenstein; but who can resist Lucia Popp?  She matches Bertini in tone and in intelligence, so far as this Mahler goes.<br /><br />In the mighty eighth symphony, everybody is vocally present and saluting.  Paul Frey is good enough as Doctor Marianus that I sometimes get mixed up and think Ben Heppner has stepped in.  The ladies are varied enough in voice to embody their contrasting character parts, especially in the concluding Faust scene.  And for once, the three lower female voices do not have a wobbler among them?  Again the choral work is as good as it gets in this massed celebration \\"..... of stars and planets revolving in their orbits.\\"<br /><br />I can often take or leave alto, Marjana Lipovsek.  She has done several outings in Das Lied von der Erde, including a later career disc with Sir Georg Solti at the helm in Amsterdam.  I nearly always can understand and appreciate what Canadian Ben Heppner is doing in his masterly assumption of various tenor assignments.  For Bertini in Cologne, both singers rise to their finest moments.  And that says something, coming from a listener whose introduction became the long-standing gold standard in Das Lied, Klemperer with Christa Ludwig and Fritz Wunderlich.<br /><br /> To my ears?  No, I'm not giving my Klemperer Das Lied away, any time soon.  I was really happy to get it remastered in super audio.  But when I listen to Bertini's, I am carried off to a place that mesmerizes, another realm that is effectively just as much of a Mahler dream world where loss and leave-taking accost us so deeply in our shared human condition; and both of the soloists as well as the orchestra have their own special moments.<br /><br />If you want to sample Bertini's power and magic, pick your favorite difficult yet gloriously revealing moment in a symphony, and give it a spin.  One of mine that seals the desert isle deal for me is the final movement of the third symphony.  Bertini paces it so wisely, so richly, so expertly that one forgets everything but the culminating force, sealing us asleep to dream in rings of fire like Brunnehilde at the end of Wagner's Walkure.  Bertini's eloquence shapes the tenth symphony adagio to compelling effect, so much so that one wishes he had been able to record the finished performing version.<br /><br />One of the qualities that makes this complete set so persuasive to me, is that Bertini sounds like a believer in the kind of music-making we tend to associate with the last in the tradition of Old School Conductors ...a musician who embodies a calling, a commitment, to music as among the most transcendent arts.  Bertini has a technical discipline, seemingly second to none; a George Szell kind of ear for clarity .... which even some of the more dramatic Mahler leaders who have made waves among us, seem to lack.  In his own way, Bertini's path through Mahler is as filled with as much heady, deep feeling as, say, Bernstein or Tennstedt; but the clarity of fire that is so graciously elegant in retrospect, helps marks off Bertini as Grand Master in this music.  And, for me this melding of passion with clarity wins the day completely.
B006N9KFPC|5.0|and more.  It was well worth the wait, over a year, to get this album of new and exciting music from Adam.<br />This is an album to listen to from the first song to the last.<br />Great if your exercising, walking, or running,in your car. It starts out easy, fast, builds up(love Nile Rogers and Sam Sparro on Shady) and then cools you down with his amazing vocals, and his feelings come through on every song.  This album is, sincere and written from his heart and soul, for the masses, great for radio and everything you could ever want!

0765316994|2.0|Dear Mr. Scalzi,<br /><br />I really enjoy your writing and pre-ordered this book about 6 weeks ago. I have enjoyed all your material that I've read to date. However, this one misfired. I'd like $6.00 of the $11.00 I spent on the Kindle edition back. Or, if that's not an option, I would encourage you to spend that $6.00 on making sure that your next book idea is a good idea before you write it.<br /><br />This is like an SNL skit that was funny for 7 minutes, but really tiring at 90 minutes. (However, this is better than McGruber.) It just winks at the reader too often.<br /><br />The premise is entertaining and it is handled it a funny and thoughtful way. Like most of your characters, they're engaging and likable. I like the \\"Real Genius\\" thing going on. However, it some point it just gets too ironic. Too self-referential. It gets smug. Ironic is OK for an SNL skit - not a whole book. (Unless you're a hipster d-bag.)<br /><br />In closing, I'd like $6.00 back.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />T. J.

B003YI3D4K|4.0|Brahms' Second Piano Concerto is considered to be one of the greatest piano concertos, if not the greatest, and is a \\"desert island\\" choice for many classical music connoisseurs. Brahms himself played the piano part in the concerto's 1881 debut in Budapest. Consisting of four movements, this concerto has been described as a \\"symphony with piano obbligato,\\" and indeed the orchestra has a role equal in importance to the piano. The second movement, \\"allegro appassionato,\\" was described jokingly by Brahms in a letter to Clara Schumann as \\"a tiny wisp of a scherzo,\\" but it is the most dramatic movement in an otherwise sunny work.<br /><br />There are many wonderful moments in this concerto: the opening horn theme that is then echoed and developed in a piano cadenza, the mysterious passage that leads to the recapitulation, the sudden change from minor to major key in the second movement trio, the gorgeous cello solo that opens the third movement andante, and the accelerated conclusion of the last movement sonata-rondo, to name just a few. The work showcases Brahms' special talents as both a pianist and a symphonist.<br /><br />Russian pianist Sviatoslav Richter came to the U.S. to perform this concerto at a live concert with the Chicago Symphony under Erich Leinsdorf in 1960, a performance that proved to be a sensation. A studio recording, the one on this CD, was made a few days later and was one of the earliest stereo recordings.<br /><br />There is much to commend about this recording. Richter and the Chicagoans take very fast tempos, especially in the first movement, and I marvel at how Richter manages to keep the notoriously difficult piano part together and crystal clear. But this is more \\"allegro assai\\" than the indicated \\"allegro non troppo,\\" and though the rushing runs are exciting, much of the lyricism in this movement is lost. I don't think Brahms intended the movement to be played this rapidly.<br /><br />The tempo of the second movement is equally fast, but here it seems more appropriate for this almost frenetic scherzo, and Richter keeps the tension high, though there's a slight bit of relaxation in the trio section. The third movement andante is performed as a true andante, not as the adagio of many other performances, and Richter is adept at bringing out the lyricism of the piano part on its entry after the cello solo. He does slow in the piu adagio section, where the music becomes almost ethereal, but doesn't stall out the way Watts/Bernstein do in their recording.<br /><br />The finale is marked \\"allegretto grazioso,\\" but here it is performed at a tempo that I would call \\"allegro.\\" Once again, some of its lyrical quality is lost, and it is probably faster than what Brahms had in mind, though some other pianists and orchestras take it nearly as fast. Richter and Leinsdorf bring the concerto to an exciting conclusion.<br /><br />This is one of four versions of this concerto that I currently possess; the others are Ashkenazy/Haitink, Arrau/Haitink, and Watts/Bernstein. Although these are all worthy performances, none is completely ideal. Ashkenazy tends to be slower and somewhat ponderous, Arrau is also slower and a bit too fussy in the piano passages. Watts, at only 22, plays remarkably well until the overly slow movement is reached. I'd be interested to know what other connoisseurs of this wonderful concerto think is the best recording available.<br /><br />Also on the CD is a performance by Richter of Beethoven's \\"Appassionata\\" sonata. Richter gives this well-known piece a very dramatic reading; it swings from pp to ff and back again at the drop of a hat. It's a stunning bravura performance, much more exciting than the usual performance of this sonata, and almost worth the price of this CD on its own.<br /><br />This recording from the beginning of the stereo era has been put through \\"direct stream digital\\" remastering. The resulting sound quality is reasonably good, especially for the piano. The bass seems a littleweak unless it is boosted a bit.<br /><br />In conclusion, Richter is an impressive pianist, spectacular in the Beethoven, but rapid-fire and not very lyrical in the outer movements of the Brahms concerto. But it may please those who are looking for an especially lively performance of this work.weak unless it is boosted a bit.<br /><br />In conclusion, Richter is an impressive pianist, spectacular in the Beethoven, but rapid-fire and not very lyrical in the outer movements of the Brahms concerto.

1416562605|4.0|This is an eye opening novel of corruption and oppression in modern day India.  The protagonist cannot free himself from bondage of class and station without committing crimes, so even then (to my way of thinking) he is not free.  Somehow this book is both a fast-paced entertaining read, and a deeply challenging one the more you contemplate it.  It would stimulate a wonderful book-club discussion, since there are many metaphorical layers to consider and questions to plumb.<br /><br />This peak into Indian society made me grateful for the moral fiber of our nation; we spotlight exceptions to this norm, but mostly we take it for granted.  Even though we no longer live so close to the law of the jungle - eat or be eaten - we need to be reminded not to become soft and myopic. How can life dictated by ethical principle maintain the cutting edge?  If we refuse to kill or bribe, can we continue to rule?<br /><br />I give this book only 4 stars, but I'm glad I read it and am still thrashing it around in my thought.  And now I'm praying about the insidious nature corruption again, which, other than Monsanto, I have let slip off my radar since no longer working with NYC contractors...

B0041KKYCY|4.0|First of all, I have never seen the original though I have seen trailers. As I stated, many people will not want to watch this film. I read many of the  reviews written here, and, as always, I respect the reviewers opinions. I will say that I feel this movie is very, very well made, for it's type! While it is graphic, it does not wallow in gore! The rape scene does seem to last a long time, as one viewer put it, but there is surprisingly little nudity involved. Yet, it is one of the most gut wrenching I have ever experienced on film, you feel such sympathy for the victim.  As another viewer asked why make this film, and I say why make any film? I have got to say, that the revenge rendered is sweet, and well, maybe a little \\"elaborate\\" for such a backwoods location. It was also well acted - particularly our heroine! She deserves major kudos for transporting herself to such a desolate place. I Spit on Your Grave is what it is! If you are curious and have the wherewithall - give it a look.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|The book itself is written in quite easy to understand language. However, the author does go in a lot of details that might not be interesting to everybody, so you should stay alert while reading it.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that is actively against religion, look elsewhere. Having said that however, this is one of the best books about evolution and the discoveries behind it. It explains a lot of fascinating techniques behind the science of evolution, geology and nature itself.

B0067QPVJ6|4.0|By calling this movie \\"The Thing\\" instead of something like \\"The Thing Arises\\" may have been the main reason why it bombed at the box office. It turns out to be a prequel of \\"John Carpenter's The Thing\\" from 1982 instead of a remake.<br /><br />The cast is actually quite good, since the film uses actors who are from the actual places that the characters are supposed to be from, bringing a feel of authenticity in speech, personalities, and culture. The sets' details are done so well they look like the old sets.<br /><br />Viewers ages 10-15 may find it very scary; others, campy, which compliments JC's film. Die hard fans of the 1982 film may find some minor flaws and parallels that the casual viewer wouldn't notice. It's not necessary to have seen the 1982 movie to watch this one. Make sure to continue through the credits as it has additional scenes which link to the other movie. It's quite neat to see this one and then watch the 1982 movie afterwards.<br /><br />DVD BONUS FEATURES:<br />1. The DVD has 7 deleted scenes. (see comments section for what the scenes are, which will contain SPOILERS)<br />2. \\"The Thing Evolves\\" and \\"Fire & Ice\\" are behind the scenes footage on the making of the movie.<br />3. Feature commentary with the director and producer.
0553582038|1.0|The series started out great and pulled in you with the characters and the story lines.<br /><br />Unfortunetly book 4 is the start of George just unraveling his mind on paper.

B007Q1VUFA|5.0|Fantasic album from CRB! As soon as i started listening to this album my mouth dropped. The album has a very Cosmic/Trippy vibe to it. But what made my mouth drop was that the music on this album sounds so much like The grateful deads most prime years. There are many parts where i can hear lots of Europe 72. Even the guitar playing sounds like the dead but they even nailed the tone & vibe. There are parts where i can hear Dark Star & I Know You Rider about to begin. But then Chris Robinson kicks in with vocals & takes it to a different level. It is one of the best jam albums i've heard & a very good jam band. Just wait till you hear the musicianship on this album. And this album like most of the Black Crowes albums is recorded live in the studio. It just amazes me that they can record it live all in one room & get the tone & vibe even with the gentle soft touch parts. To me it sounds like a cross of the Grateful Dead in there prime with better recording kinda like Phil Lesh & friends or  The Dead with the newer members that they were touring with a few years back. If you like The Grateful Dead & The Black Crowes You should love this album.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I have been reading the reviews of this book and am amazed at the volume of wording in the responses. It is clear George pulled his readers in and we invested in the journey. Unfortunetly, Book 4 started to unravel the story lines and now book 5 has it completely lost. Their are few characters left to care about and it seems he is just going to kill them off anyway. The story lines are random, lengthy and uninteresting.<br /><br />I am giving up at this point with zero interest in following the journey through George cluttered and unkept mind. It is too bad he has left his readers for his own self indulgence.<br /><br />It really is just a mess.
0307454568|2.0|I was a huge fan of the first two books, but this conclusion of the trilogy really tried my patience. Layer after layer of investigators and journalists are introduced.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I hesitate in even calling this a \\"story\\" as I am sure that a great deal of it was taken from the experiences of the Navy Seals that are the actual actors in this movie.  Its also not just an incredible action adventure that is set in current time w/realistic situations(not the hollywood scripts!) but it also has a great story/lesson in it.  I watched it 3 times in the first 2 days of owning it.  When filming the movie, the Seal Team obviously had access to their own real equipment.  I mention this as you can tell the difference from your normal hollywood set/props in this film.  There is a boat scene that will simply blow your mind away when you see what they can do!!!  Stop reading, buy the movie.  Im going to watch it again tonight!

0439023521|4.0|I decided to read the book after seeing the movie, because It seemed I was missing part of the back story.  The book was a good read, the characters compelling, not as much in depth character development or Panem (where the book takes place) back story as I am used to with writers like Branden Sanderson or JV jones but that being said I finished the book within 48 hours.  I think part of the equation is that these books are young adult books. P.S. Jennifer Lawrence (Katness) in the movie is just as visualized in the book!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The best book of the trilogy! This story has lust, love, romance, drama, and suspence!

0307730697|5.0|Fearless is the fascinating biography of Adam Brown, a proud member of US Navy Seal Team Six who lost his life in Afghanistan.  Adam is a true American hero.  Yet what makes Eric Blehm's biography interesting is not Adam's military career, but what he overcame to join the military, become a member of the Navy Seals' most elite squadron and become a leader and a hero.<br /><br />Blehm conducted extensive interviews with Adam's family, friends and fellow Seals to create a portrait of a man who overcame his poor choices as a young adult to become a strong man of God; a leader willing to lay down his life for his family and country.  Adam's family wasn't wealthy, but he graduated from high school and started college before he started to drift aimlessly, unsure of what he wanted to do except party with his girlfriend Cindy.  His life became a downward spiral that included drugs and jail.<br /><br />It is nothing short of miraculous that Adam found God, found his wife Kelley, and was allowed to join the Navy.  He finally found his calling when he was accepted into the Navy Seals program.  The mental, physical and emotional challenges helped him to grow as a leader.<br /><br />Blehm's biography of Adam Brown reads like a good novel.  Yet the story and all of the characters are real.  Blehm shows how God can take a flawed man and make a hero that we can all admire.<br /><br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group Blogging for Books program for this review.

Now imagine you were given a sizeable budget and lots of computer time for CGI and told \\"make Monsters In Space, part V.\\"  If you were very, very sloppy and never re-read your script to catch inconsistencies and at the same time assumed your audience was so hopelessly ignorant and retarded that they just wouldn't notice that the whole thing was a pig's breakfast, this is pretty much the movie you'd make.<br /><br />In other words, almost any alternative to wasting two hours of your life would be better than consuming precious moments watching this piece of pretentious but utterly hollow and very silly rubbish. Avoid at all costs.

B005JZBP8W|5.0|WOW, WOW, WOW,       this is for the 50th anniversary edition,  We all love MY Fair Lady, or you wouldn't be reading the reviews, I have had MFL on LaserDisc (both pan and scan) as well as both DVD releases, none of them had a very good picture, (or sound for that matter) CBS has spent $600,000.00 to restore this film, and it shows, the only version I have seen that could compete with this BR, was when I saw the original release in the Theater, over 50 years ago, believe me when I tell you that you will enjoy this BR, the picture is fantastic, and they have even fixed the sound elements, if you love this movie do not hesitate to get the 50th anniversary edition
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|When I was a kid I learned to read from TinTin comic books. I loved TinTin more than Batman, Superman, Alice in Wonderland, or any other childhood character. As a result I was a bit dubious about the translation into movie form. The television cartoon had been awful and while it was Peter Jackson and Speilberg, so I knew that the effects etc would be good, I didn't know what they'd do to the story. While it's not in the exact order things happened in the comics, it's true to the spirit of the comics. All in all it's a truly excellent screen adaptation of what is one of the best comic books ever written.

B0051UP5NQ|2.0|Overall, this is a nice app with bells and whistles.<br /><br />However, I'm giving this a 2-star because the first time you start the application the developer wants you to buy a font pack with very basic fonts such as Arial, Calibri, Courier and Times New Roman for $4.99 I believe basic fonts should be included in this premium priced Office Suite. Did the developer just forget that I just bought the app?
0345802934|2.0|As with a lot of modern \\"great literature,\\" 1Q84 is a narcissistic exercise. One hundred pages in and she's still climbing down the stairs.  Tedious, tedious, tedious. I'm sorry I wasted the time I did on it.

B002JODV3S|5.0|Not for the faint of heart or aurally unqualified!  That being said, Vai and company really hit a home run with the bases loaded on this one.  It is my understanding that he won a grammy for one of the numbers performed (Now We Run?).  Bottom line; he certainly deserves a grammy for this performance; it gives new meaning to the phrase \\"shock and awe\\"!  Heck get the CD soundtrack as well as the video; it's worth it.  We're talkin' Mahavishnu Orchestra on steroids!  It's awesome!  Do it again Stevie!  Do it again!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome. I think everyone should absulutely love it. It is very easy. Just about everyone should have the game if they have a tablet.
B00000DOYH|5.0|I agree with most of the positive reviewers here.  I was in college when this double disc set first came out.  We were all Zep fans; we listened to and liked all their lps.  This one was no exception.  If there is something better than one disc of Led Zeppelin songs, it's two discs of Led Zeppelin songs.  Last night I saw (for the second time) this album performed as part of the Classic Rock Live series at Hard Rock in Orlando. Seeing the album performed note for note gives one a new perspective and appreciation of just what went into this recording.  For instance, I didn't realize how many times Jimmy had to overdub himself on many of these songs.  I'm talking about up to 5 guitars at times.  Also, I can't emphasize enough the tour de force that is Kashmir!  Twice I've seen this performed by the Classic Rock Live musicians (including a string section comprised of 2 violins & 1 cello) and twice it has left the entire audience absolutely stunned, breathless and speechless.  I was fortunate enough to see Led Zeppelin perform Stairway To Heaven (a few months before the lp containing that track was released) back in the '70's.  It certainly did impress, but Kashmir.....whoa Nelly! PS Rolling Stone Magazine's rock critics routinely trashed Led Zeppelin.  Shows you how much the culture elite know; nothing!
B008469DGY|5.0|I had doubts about this game at first,  but after I played it the first time I'm hooked!  The graphics are nice and even if you don't play golf,  you'll love this game.  There are a lot of levels to keep you busy for hours.
B000N4SADC|5.0|Fantastic recording!  The music speaks directly to me and I suspect a great many others.  It takes classic fusion and moves it foreward a generation or two.  Best recording of 2007.  I quite by accident checked this out from my local library.  I was not familiar with this artist or her music.  After one play I immediately sought out the SACD for purchase and I will never part with it.  Hiromi is hot and on fire, her mind complex and her hands are all over the keyboard. No wonder everyone wants her to be on their recordings. She is a breath of fresh air. All the other musicians on this are at the top of their game as well.  Please purchase this recording immediately.  Play it; learn it and you can't help but love it.  Also, there is a live concert DVD of these musicians performing these songs that must be experienced.  Brilliantly conceived and expertly executed!  Well done Hiromi!  Where have you been all my life?
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Comparing this to QuickOffice Pro, the layout in OfficeSuite is more efficient and practical for use on a small screen or a touch screen in general. Even without comparing this to any other office Android office software, it's still prettt nice overall. It has all the features to make a decent document, spreadsheet, or presentation.<br />However there is one problem with it that prevents me from giving it a full five stars. While this app was 99&cent; today I see as little of a deal with this as I would if I had just paid $14.99, but as soon as I started using this app it tried to sell me a $5 font pack. While this would be a nice feature, it's off-putting to have your software try to sell you more software right after you buy it as if it doesn't quite understand that you already paid money for the thing.<br />I'm not getting upset right now since I got it on sale for really cheap, but if I paid full price for this app and then saw that I'd be angry.
1451627289|3.0|I'll echo a lot of the other reviews.  This book is fantastic 5-stars in the first half and 1-star in the second half.  When it's a character driven story and the moral dilemmas about Jake's actions, it's great.  When it's a first person perspective of the days leading up to Oswald it's just dull and bordering on fanfiction.  The ending was eminently predictable and I'm not a particularly sharp reader in that regard.<br /><br />I would still just barely recommend it, but with the caveat that it's weak at the end so the prospective reader would be prepared for the letdown.
B000008LH5|4.0|My first time of getting to hear this classic live lp on CD reissue. I haven't heard this long player in eons. Total running time clocks in at 79:46. Wow. Not quite as out-standing as the much later Ten Years After release 'Live At The Fillmore East' 2-CD (see my review) but still a must-own. 'Recorded Live' was taped at four shows from the band's 1973 European tour - gigs from Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris. About every cut here kicks ass - like \\"One Of These Days\\", the jamming \\"You Give Me Loving\\", the Ten Years After two-part classic \\"I Can't Keep From Cryin', Sometimes\\", \\"Slow Blues In C\\", the all-too familiar \\"I'm Going Home\\" and the awesome blues rocker \\"Choo Choo Mama\\". Also read somewhere that 'Recorded Live' was initially released to deter the demand for a poor-quality live Ten Years After bootleg record. Trust me on this, mission was more than fully accomplished.

0312370849|5.0|This work of FICTION helps to further the understanding of what it was like for Parisian Jewish children who were taken out of school, corralled and forced to wait to be shipped out of France.  It's hard to draw the connection of how small children can't understand why they can't go home, can't be comfortable, have nowhere to sit or lie down whilst their machine gun toting tormentors are unsympathetic to their discomfort and tears.<br /><br />This book clouds that the Could Have Been Worse fate that Sarah must have learned of postwar was this:  [[ASIN:B0007K2SRG Piepel]]

0920236162|4.0|I do like how the female protagonist outwits the dragon without the use of violence.  However, I felt that the ending, \\"You're a bum!\\" lowered her to the shallow  Prince's level.  For my granddaughter, I changed the ending to read:<br />\\"You are not worthy of me, and I prefer not to marry you.  I am strong.  I am smart, and I am quite capable of taking care of myself!\\"
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is awesome! Similar to Xbox version. Good graphics on Droid Bionic. I'm very happy with the purchase. I bought it some time ago and recently redownloaded it.
0307730697|5.0|I'm sitting here with tears still streaming down my face. I just finished a great book about a great man.<br />A man who was a \\"Tender Warrior\\" - a man of courage, valor, compassion and brave beyond all words. He gave his life for his country- for his family, his way of life and ours.<br />After reading this amazingly well-written book I feel like the loss was personal, and I guess in a way it is. The soldiers who fight for us really do fight for me and for you. We forget that, don't we?<br /><br />Adam Brown was a man who conquered whatever he set out to accomplish \\"against all odds\\" time and again. He conquered drugs and crime, betrayal and his own flesh to become a man of uncompromising character and selfless determination. Adam was a humble hero. He loved as hard as he fought and he fought hard. He overcame his past,  physical injuries and then serious limitations- time and again...<br /><br />Eric Blehm tells Adams story in a manner that is rich in detail, honest, oh-so-honest, and riviting.<br />Adam Brown was a fearless Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator, but he shines in my heart still as a rugged, loving, Daddy who died wearing Batman underwear.<br />This book made me laugh, sob, and think- I know it changed me.<br />I didn't really think I would get into this book. I really ordered it for my husband. When it arrived I planned on reading it before him in order to get this review done, but he snapped it up first. He loves these kinds of books, and it's no wonder. He has become a similar kind of man. I thought of him at times throughout the book, the way he beat odds, refuses to give up, looks amazing in his uniform and uses his strength for others at work and then at home tenderly changes diapers on a drug baby because I'm tired and worn out, even though he might not have slept for 2 days straight. The world needs more men like these.<br /><br /> My husband read \\"Fearless\\" twice in a row before I got it, cried both times, and I know he was changed. Even in death Adam is mentoring men. Praise Jesus, who Adam Brown loved and served!<br />I think this should be required reading for highschool and college students. And housewives, plumbers, and anybody else alive. Seriously, there are not words for this book.<br />And you know something else, Adam Brown's wife was every bit the warrior he was. She amazed me just as much as he did. Kelley Brown is an American hero, no question.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I liked this book better than the first. There was character development and some cliffhangers that made me want to read the third.

B0086700CM|1.0|I thought this would be a good game based on the reviews but it wasn't. one thing that I don't like about it is that it goes on forever. there is never a end to the level or anything. I just have one thing to say. well the hell with this!
B000ZLFALS|4.0|When I first saw this film, I think I liked it so much because I was shocked it's wasn't a complete train wreck. After a few additional watches with friends, I have to say this is a really good film. I hate when people think they can muck about with Beatles songs and lyrics. It's rarely done well. It has moments of brilliance and some not so much. I think I like the edgy story and acting. It's not so sugar sweet, like some of the songs, so it works for me.<br />Any Beatles fan will at least like this enough to recommend.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book is truly extraordinary!!! It will captivate you and make you fall head over heels in love the characters I guarantee that once you read this book it will automatically be one of your all-time favorites and you will be craving for more! Discovery of Witches is so passionate and intense unlike any other book about vampires and witches book you have ever or will ever read I laughed and cried while reading this book I read it about 4 times and still can't say that I'm tired of it. Diana Bishop's is a intellectual women and challenged witch with great power and she doesn't even know how special she is until the deliciously sensual vampire Matthew Clairmont comes and makes her see herself and in the process he finds a side of him he never knew existed a side that no longer belongs to him but to Diana yet the rules say a witch and vampire are never to fall in love so it bound to get messy..... Discovery of Witches has a spark in it that just explodes and fills that reader up .... Beautifully written Deborah Harkness is amazing I can't wait for Shadow of Night to come out already I feel like I have been waiting my whole life!!!! <3

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|For those of you wondering ... yes, this is a prequel to the 1979 sci-fi hit [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien (The Director's Cut)]]. However, it is notsomuch the origin of the Alien (even though that is included), but it is more of the origin story of the Weyland Corporation (from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation of the original \\"Alien\\" movie franchise) and his true obsessive reasoning for space exploration. The overall story structure of the film follows closely to the original \\"Alien\\" in regard to the fact that it starts out slow and appearing as some mere space exploration film, but then all hell breaks loose! Not much happens in the exact story, but the overall legend that this story adds to the Alien universe is essential! Plus, \\"Prometheus\\" has a scene involving a high-tech operation table where my jaw literally dropped; I couldn't believe that writers Lindelof (of TV's \\"Lost\\") and Spaihts went there! And just when you think, \\"What's gonna happen now?\\", the film answers your question but with one minor caveat (the ending is still somewhat open), and ultimately ends on a great note that will give film geeks that orgasmic feeling. Performances are wonderful, effects are even better and the alien design is exquisite! Kudos, Mr. Scott! Kudos.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|I knew from the outset that this film would be nothing short of great. Especially after I heard that Joss Whedon was co-writing and directing the film. This is the man that has created some of the best television ever ([[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy the Vampire Slayer - The Complete Series (Seasons 1-7) (2010) 39 Disc]], [[ASIN:B003YF9Q08 Angel: Complete Series]], [[ASIN:B0000AQS0F Firefly - The Complete Series]], [[ASIN:B0042RUHVY Dollhouse: The Complete Seasons 1 & 2]]) as well as some great cinema ([[ASIN:B000Q9IZ5C Serenity (Collector's Edition)]], \\"Cabin in the Woods\\"). This comic book film adaptation is about as perfect as it comes; it's Marvel's equivalent to DC's [[ASIN:B001GZ6QDS The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]. However, it still has Marvel's trademark wham-bam sci-fi dazzle, unlike DC's more gritty realism (part of the reason I like DC more). Luckily, though, Whedon is able to pull it all off. His perfect talent of blending action, drama and humor pays off big-time! And, it doesn't hurt that he has a ridiculous knowledge and understanding of the Avengers and their mythology. Next to the Fantastic Four, the Avengers are the perfect dysfunctional family (that's one thing they *do* have over my favorite, the Justice League). I was especially happy to see that they finally got the Hulk's story right (third time's a charm). I'd still like to see a female Avenger other than Black Widow; but hope she might make an appearance in the new Daredevil reboot. All of the performances were solid, making the movie as enjoyable as can be. Favorite moment has to involve main baddie, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Every character has equal screen-time and their stories given some good light ... but not too much, leaving room for more revelation for sequels. One thing DC should do is take a cue from this film and if they EVER plan on making a Justice League film, they should try (and hope) to get the actors they've cast in other films -- i.e., Christian Bale as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern. However, unfortunately, seeing how Bale no longer wants to do Batman after this summer's film, and DC doesn't wish to connect their films, I doubt this will happen. However, there has been recent news that DC is in the process of making a Justice League film. Anyways, Whedon and company get it right! This very well might be the action flick to see this summer! There's no more to say other than this film is awesome!ian Bale as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Ryan Reynolds as Green Lantern.

0061743526|5.0|This was one of the books I have been wanting to read since my daughter was in school. I am glad I purchased it. This book was in good condition.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Okay, so first off I rarely give a movie 5 stars. To me that means it's as near perfect as a film can be. This one definitely makes the case. I won't go over what everyone else is saying about how well designed, shot & acted this is because pretty much everyone agrees on that. What I have noticed is many critics are saying there are too many questions left unanswered and it's too open ended. Well, Blade Runner got the same sort comments from critics (far worse actually) and after people sat with it for a while they realized it was a masterpiece. This is another one of those movies. So, since this movie does not tell you how Ripley's ship came to find a giant derelict on a distant planet (and why should it?) there are two big questions are left open to discussion, one is answered and one is not: SPOILERS START HERE: #1: Why did the \\"Engineers\\" make us? and #2: Why did they decide to end us?. #1 is a question that's really something that should be left open in my opinion. You don't do a movie telling us the purpose of life. That's preachy in my opinion. That's what faith is about. And though it's discussed quite a bit Ridley Scott is not making this movie to tell you if God exists and if so why did he make us. What it is doing is showing the power of faith & reason and how science and religion can co-exist. Big stuff for a summer movie blockbuster. #2 is actually answered in the film, just not expressively so. Why did they decide to send these bio-warfare ships to earth and destroy us? Well, it's all in the title my friends. We (the human race) began to use 'fire' in ways that were a threat to the \\"Engineers\\". They are themselves a violent race so it's not that they thought, \\"oh these humans are being bad, we've got to stop them from hurting themselves\\". No it's, \\"these humans are getting really good at making war and and someday they'll be able to kill us\\" (remember David's line: \\"Everyone wants to kill their parents\\"). And since we were genetic replicas of the Engineers they knew we'd someday be capable of creating faster than light technology and they knew there were signs all over the earth of where they came from..or is it where they were making the weapons to destroy us (back up plan maybe?). So they took measures to do the job by designing these parasitic life forms that would be really good at killing humans and possibly take our place on Earth. Again, David (who had the whole thing figured out) tells us \\"sometimes you have to destroy before you can create\\". Remember, as soon as the humans got into the chamber with all of the canisters that goo starting coming out. Talk about a smart bomb!  And a big clue is the carbon dating on the Engineer's body, about 3 thousand years ago they were getting ready to launch their mission to earth. In the movie's time that would be oh say around O B.C. when the Romans were conquering everyone and everything and Jesus came along to show us another way. As we all know things didn't work out too well. Riddley Scott even suggested in a recent interview with movies.com that maybe Jesus was the last ambassador to get us to change our ways. And of course, he was crucified. I bet Fox asked him to leave that one out of the film for obvious reason.<br />I guess there is one other big question that's left open, where do the Xenomorphs (original aliens) fit in to all this? Well the last shot of the movie shows the beginning of that race. Obviously related and another form of bio warefare but not quite the same.<br /><br />So, in short there are lots of great questions and lots of great clues. An entertaining movie that makes you really think which is all too rare these days.  If you're looking for a movie to spell it all out for you this isn't for you. But it is a perfect example of what good sci-fi is supposed to be. Asking the big questions in an entertaining way and in the case of Prometheus, scaring the hell out of you in the process.
B005KELW26|5.0|I love my tab folio.  It protects my Kindle Fire and allows me to keep my stylist with it.  I have a pocket to put receipts, and of course it's my favorite color.
B005F3XV62|4.0|So I got this out of the Red Box cuz I really like Kevin James and he always makes me laugh<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />There's very little about this movie that I didn't like.  First of all, Adam Sandler's voice was just plain annoying when he was doing the voice of the monkey.  I wanted to say to my television, \\"Adam, you're trying too hard.  You're better than this!\\"  Also whoever did the voice of the giraffe was just PAINFUL to listen to.  I wanted to mute my TV everytime I saw that damn giraffe but I didn't cuz I didn't want to miss part of the story.<br /><br />Also at the end when Kevin James is running around trying to find Rosario Dawson's character cuz he doesn't want her to leave the country before he can talk to her, when he's doing all this running around and trying to catch her...  Why doesn't he just call her?  I'm sure she has a cell phone and since they worked together for five years, I'm sure he has her number.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />So this movie had a basic cookie cutter plot, guy tries to get girl, realizes that he doesn't want her and goes after the girl he has known his whole life that he really loves.  It's pretty funny and I enjoyed it, it was worth my $1.30
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The subject area did not interest me initially but the story became increasingly compelling. Despite being labelled \\"Mommy Porn\\", I found it interesting to gain an understanding of this BDSM lifestyle. Naturally the romantic in me wanted Christian and Ms. Swan to have a happy ending and as a result, I found myself riveted to the trilogy, reading to the conclusion. The story made me frown, smile, laugh out loud, squirm and sigh.
B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|I love action movies, and I love spy movies, but I don't like movies that can't decide which one they want to be.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />At first I thought I was watching the set up for an action movie.  Then It went into a spy movie, then it tried to end being an action movie.<br /><br />This movie also tried to be Pulp Fiction where they show the movie happening all out of order, and it was just stupid.<br /><br />Also what was the point?  Why did they want her dead?  On top of that we didn't get to see the ending of the movie.  She just dropped on the guy's patio and he's all like, \\"Oh my god!\\"  Then we cut to black.  That crap didn't work for the Sopranos, one of the most successful television shows of all time.  What the hell made the writer think it would work for this thing that was released in January 2012?  Also in case you (my reader) doesn't know, January is where most studios dump their stinkers off because it's the beginning of the post-holiday slump and historically movie ticket sales are at their worst in that month.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />If you ask how I would make it better, I would say: Put the story in order, tell the main actress to put some actual EFFORT into her acting, tell Ewan to stop doing things for a paycheck, and can we stop with the constant chase scenes that essentially go nowhere?<br /><br />I am so glad I got this out of the Redbox and didn't actually buy it.
B0086700CM|4.0|Great app, but the accelerometer needs to be more responsive on the Kindle Fire, when I hold it upright then it goes to the right and he doesn't turn as responsive as the iPhone app. please fix this.
145162445X|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It is well-written and imparts valuable information with humor and wit. The topic may seem intimidating, but it is presented in a clear, readable way. For readers not familiar with the scientific method, Lawrence Krauss shows that the conclusions are not arrived at heedlessly, but with much empirical evidence and corroboration. I recommend this book to anyone.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I went into this film with no expectations at all, a free and clear mind.  And I can truly say, \\"Thank you Ridley Scott.\\"<br />Having read quite a few reviews here, Iv'e noticed many lackluster or negative reviews. Well, to each his own. Its been some years that Iv'e gone to a film that has truly blown my mind. Most of Science Fiction today is so poor and embarrasing, that it hurts to watch. This is the return of true Sci-Fi genius and done by a master of the genre.<br />Some people are saying, \\"They didn't explain that\\", or \\"I don't get it\\", or \\"that doesn't make sense.\\" Well, not all films explain everything, and to me, that's a good thing. I was glued to my seat the whole time and my palms were so sweaty, I dropped my pop.<br />I'm not going to go into a massive rant about the effects, or the plot or the macabre sets. There's plenty of those reviews here.<br /><br />(Thumbs up to Michael Fassbender who's performance as the android David was extrordinary.)<br /><br />So my point is basically do what other reviews have said, \\"don't expect Oscars\\" and go into this with a clear head and forget about \\"Alien\\". Even though you'll want to watch \\"Alien\\" as soon as you get home from the theatre.<br />I want to give this 5 stars but I have to go with my gut and give it 4 and a half stars. Still a remarkable accomplishment.<br /><br />This is truly unbelievable filmaking and this is what Sci-Fi is all about. Take it for what it is, a spetacular ride from start to finish.<br /><br />And thanks again Ridley for a truly remarkable film. Cannot wait for \\"Blade Runner 2.\\" And of course, \\"Prometheus 2.\\"
B000683VI4|2.0|the most pretentious, predictable movie. :/ i don't know why people refer to it as being one of the best romances... i normally like romance / drama movies but it's too predictable, no point watching when you know how it's going to turn out. i prefer titanic, the painted veil, romeo & juliet, benjamin button, atonement, etc to this. don't even get me started on superior foreign romances (moment to remember, frozen flower, my sassy girl). there are many more interesting romances than the notebook...maybe i just dislike nicholas sparks stories.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very very very fun app. i love this app. this app is a very great time waster.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love it on my Kindle Fire.  It starts off easy to allow you to get the hang of it then gets difficult to diabolical fairly quickly.  I only gave it four stars for two reasons.  First, even on my kindle it has to be zoomed out because it's so sensitive and with larger, more difficult puzzles you will definitely need a stylus (and I have small fingers).  Second, my Kindle gets shared with family and friends so it would be nice if the option to be able to switch between multiple players.  I have a hint for you players out there; the game will save your progress but not the undo button so be sure you are happy with your progress if you have to exit before you leave.
B00511ONPG|5.0|The book helped me get over 1500 likes, for my page on Facebook about my book recently published on Kindle, in less than 30 days. Likeable Social Media is focused on how to market today using social media, on understanding the rules and best practices for Facebook & Co. The book is full of insight on how social networks work and how to take advantage of them for marketing purposes. I enjoyed reading the book and learned a lot.

B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I never seen any of the previous Aliens movies and as this is the only movie I seen, I must have to said that this movie isn't that good.<br /><br />My friends invited me to watch this movie because they got free tickets to go watch it and so I watched it with them. I didn't know anything about this movie going into it. Only when I got there my friends told me it was a prequel to Alien, so that's good because I didn't see Alien in the first place, so I'm at a good start in terms of learning about the storyline.<br /><br />I thought the whole idea of one giant race of beings made us was so stupid. And, how it all started was the group told this one being that he should scarface his life to create the human race was dumb. Then, all he needed to do was to drink some black stuff out of a cup. This would start destroy his cells and then he would drops himself into the waterfall. When that happens all of his DNA will now somehow create human race. The very idea was so stupid.<br /><br />I only like the graphics and special effects in this movie. All those star maps are very impressive. Also the look of the beings look very real and the aliens too.<br /><br />What I found stupid was that the main female scientist didn't want to bring weapons into the cave/structure. She said it was a scientific mission and so they didn't need it. What in the hell was she thinking??? She doesn't know what's down in there? Is she thinking they can reason with whatever hostile inside? Well, that's usually not going to happen. Look, they are the invaders and for them to go somewhere totally new like this, 90% of the time, it doesn't turn out good. And, they're not just going to a new place, they're going to a whole new planet! Dumbest move ever made!<br /><br />What even proved main point even further was when, they actually meet the creator. They waked him from hyper sleep and not even 1 minute into the conversation were they all died!!! Anyone that was surprised by that must be on the same page as the stupid scientist. Also, only one person had a flame thrower? Oh come on??? Really??? They should had all had 1 weapon at least, but they thought they could just \\"reason with him\\". NO WAY!!!<br /><br />Again, they are the invaders and they don't know what they're going to find. Most likely, it's not going to be good when they meet with whatever down there. The only time, the female scientist ever thought she needed a weapon was after she got back to her small safe pod that rip from the main ship. Then, she hears a noise. So, she gets a weapon? What in the world??? She now thinks she can defect whatever she finds inside. Anyone else would had picked up a weapon and ran for the hills, but no. Not her. She got an axe and now she thinks she can go find it and kill whatever inside. Dumb move and dumber moves.<br /><br />This movie is below average in terms of story and common sense. My friends told me it gave them even more questions than answers and so it was worse for them than me. If I had watched the other aliens movie, I'll probably give this movie a 1 star!!!<br /><br />But, they lucked out and I gave it a 2 stars just because I don't know much than what I saw. But, what I saw wasn't exactly, the best I have ever seen. I've seen way better other alien type movies with better story plots and things that actually made more sense. If I were to pay to see this movie, I would had wanted my money back!!!

1609613937|5.0|Thank you John and Mary McDougall for another book explaining and expanding on the benefits of a plant based diet.<br /><br />Long before celebrities started jumping on the vegan band wagon Dr. McDougall was telling people how to get healthy and stay healthy.  This newest book is more of the same, with evidence and testimonies from \\"Star McDougallers\\" who have been reading his books and following his advice for their best health.  The standard American diet is making people fat, sick and nearly dead.  A plant based diet can change the future of your health.  Don't believe what you're reading?

1450419895|5.0|As with all of Delavier;s books, more bang for the buck than the others in the huge array of excercise books. Helps you learn the complexity of the muscles<br />you work, and the excercises to pinpoint each area. Straightforward, easy to follow, and no hype. The details of the excercises might be a little more complete, but you can get that on the web in videos, if you have questions. The author is knowledgeable, and though not that well known in the US, this deserves a place in the library of anyone at any stage of bodybuilding or sports training. The anatomy charts are clear. The graphics are good. Truly, even if you have a personal trainer, their talents can vary widely especially in large gym settings...this book can really make you know the right words that signal to the trainer he/she must really work with you, and not just give you a standard workout they use for a lot of clients.<br />The author does not to seem to have been associated with any of the large supplement companies in the US, so you;re getting, sound stuff. Well organized,<br />easy to follow, and worth the price.

0345803485|1.0|I was really excited to read this book, which probably sounds a little weird, but come on, we all know why we're reading it! Anywho, page 1 and I was immediately skeptical. The voice of the main character was just off. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it just didn't read the way someone in their last year of college would speak. Then when I got to page 9 and she said satchel, I was like, nobody calls their bag their satchel. So I put the book down and looked up the author because I was like this person is either elderly or not from America. Of course, I was right...sorta. She's not elderly, but definitely not young enough to know the voice of a 20-22yr old. My opinion is that this woman should have at least considered setting the story in England/Europe so that the voice was a bit more believable. Nonetheless, i'll give it a few more pages before I completely give up.
0736092269|4.0|Illustrations wow, just wish they include more insight about each exercise on the page. You get a short intro and thats it. DOn't get me wrong, you will learn and yes it has a lot of excellent info, but wished there was more insight about using the exercise correctly and why on the same exercise page.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bough this book because it was number 1 on the list of bestsellers for kindle. I cannot understand why! For me, this book is as if a friend is telling you a story, the story is not really that good and your friend thinks you are so stupid to believe that the story can actually happen: this guy is unbelievably rich, gorgeous and amazing in bed, and he chose her, an average kinda cute inexperienced girl.<br />I could not bear to read any more about her \\"inner goddess\\", her subconscious reprehending her, \\"fifty shades\\" of this or that and last but not least, her unbelievable ability to orgasm out of thin air.<br />Honestly, I am a woman and to have an orgasm is just NOT THAT EASY! come on, that's the reason why so many women fake it anyways!<br />Please, don't waste your time, money and brain reading this book. It just does not have any context, nothing interesting happens in the book. I cannot believe this is a bestseller.<br /><br />*By the way, English is not my first language, so please excuse my writing.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|OMG!! The ONLY reason I finished this horribly written book is because I put my Kindle on Text to Speech in fast forward.  I  do not understand what the hype is about. How are people getting turned on by a crazy person wanting to beat his girlfriend when she rolls her eyes at him?

044042321X|4.0|I recently bought and tore through the first edition of the Game of Thrones Graphic Novel series.  The story essentially follows the books (and also the television series) fairly closely.  The preface, written by George R.R. Martin, was good stuff and he has to love the success his series is having. At 183 pages, this hardcover could have been longer, and ended at a point where I was just starting to become vested in the story.  It seemed to end too early.  The artist gave the characters an original look, getting very close to the image I got from reading the novels.  I did like the artwork quite a bit and the artist definitely has a lot of talent.  The overall quality of this hardcover could have been better.  I would rather have seen sewn bindings instead of glued, and the plain white cover was a but dull.  The dust jacket helps, but i would prefer full color to the pencil drawing.  If you are a fan of the books, you would most probably enjoy this rendition.  If you are a fan of comics, this story is the beginning of an adventure on an epic scale that promises to be a series worthy of collecting.  Overall, I enjoyed it and will be looking forward to the release of the second volume.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|I'm not going to go on and on in my review, but I do consider myself a big fan of the Alien franchise, with Aliens being one of my all time favorite movies.  I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie but I will say now that I loved it and I think it is just what the franchise needs to save it from the ridiculous Alien: Erection film and the AvP films (although the predator/alien fight scene in AvP 1 was pretty bad @$$)!<br /><br />They did a much better job on choosing actors this time compared to the above mentioned films in the series and I think Noomi Rapace was a great choice for the main.  Like the other reviewers have said, they do some stupid things sometimes...like wanting to pet what looks like some kind of a lethal alien snake, but overall, they're good!<br /><br />It has a controversial plot.  I loved it!  But I think it will anger the atheist crowd somewhat as the main actor still believes in God nearly 100 years from now.  This shouldn't be a reason to give the movie a 1 star rating.  And it may anger the Christians a bit by saying an alien race created us (I'm a bit of a skeptic/humanist/ancient astronaut theory kinda guy myself).<br /><br />The special effects are bad @$$!  The lighting/sets/costumes/ships and especially the storms are all done great!<br /><br />I was thinking we would see the \\"alien\\" a bit more but this movie's intention was to tell us more about the \\"space jockey\\" (although I hate that nickname) and after watching it last night, I'm glad they made it the way they did!  The ending left a lot of questions unanswered and undoubtedly left it open for part 2.  Hopefully we'll be able to find out what happens next very soon.<br /><br />With that said, disregard the minor controversy and if you're an Alien fan or not, its a must see!
B0063IH60K|1.0|could have been my favorite solitaire ever,  but I will be uninstalling it due to the horrible ads that play full screen every minute or so. you cant turn the sound off on the ads, even when its off on the game,  which means no playing somewhere quiet. pretty despicable.  a lot of us would have happily paid for the app but the developer seems only to care about his ad revenue and wont release a paid version.

B001RTSPVY|5.0|Emotionally, this TV series is very hard to follow.<br />A decent man in Albuquerque, 50 y old chemistry teacher, 'breaks bad' after a diagnosis of lung cancer. His wife is pregnant, his teenage son handicapped. He thinks he must leave them something and stumbles into the drugs business.<br />He teams up with a former student and starts a meth lab. As a producer he is an instant success. His product is superb. He takes the pseudonym Heisenberg and becomes an underworld celebrity. However, business is more than production. On the distribution side, his small team hits one disaster after the other. One step forward, two steps back.<br />The harder he works at commercial success, the further away he moves from his original purpose. He risks losing his family in the process, when his wife senses that all is not right.<br />His self diagnosis is focused on the loss of fear: he had been a coward for 50 years, until the cancer cured him. He has lost fear, and may lose everything else. Fear has a role in evolution and civilization.<br /><br />I have no idea if the details of his business and of the law enforcement side, which we follow via the brother in law, who is a DEA agent and a bit of the clown of the series, is an accurate picture of the real world. It is fearsome and scary. Better not to lose that fear.

B007NESBK2|5.0|I'm a big Sade fan, but I'm also a connoisseur of quality recordings.  This was recorded in hi definition, HD 5.1 Surround and the film was digitally shot as well.  The production quality is fantastic...you feel like you're on the fifth row.<br /><br />Now...what can I say about Sade other than she met every expectation I had of her in this concert.  I saw it live last July 2011 in Dallas and she was amazing.  This DVD captured that evening very well.  I'm buying this for several friends who aren't believers...they will be after watching this.
0375704027|1.0|I really wanted to enjoy this book, and was hoping that it would be a nice introduction to Murakami's other novels, but unfortunately I do not feel the need to read more of his work. There were many passages that were well-thought-out and incredibly unique in their thinking, all of which I enjoyed very much. My biggest vice with this novel is the overwhelming and almost ridiculous amount of suicide, a bit more darker themes, and especially sexual relations, which I honestly felt did not contribute to the message of the novel at all. The scenes were too descriptive for my liking, and many were at times revolting. I admit that I am a bit of a young reader, so for those with better tolerance for those sorts of scenes the book may be much more enjoyable. I was forced to skip over more than a couple of pages throughout the book due to the explicitness of many of the passages. Overall it was a very contemplative book on life, death, love, and human nature, but the author focused too much on carnal descriptions to interest the reader, while I felt that they were unnecessary and only ruined what would have otherwise been a very insightful and reflective novel. I'm glad to return it to the library and don't plan to look at the book ever again. Only for readers much more mature than myself.
B0001932ZA|2.0|This is a tricky one to critique, because it's devastatingly stupid in every single imaginable way, but that's also precisely what makes it such a silly, reckless good time. In many ways it's the prototypical Arnold Schwarzenegger action vehicle: tons of bad one-liners, genuinely awful action sets, a romantic subplot with zero chemistry and a retreaded sci-fi premise are only the most glaring notes on its loaded rap sheet. That he's backed by two of the genre's most notorious overactors in Jesse Ventura and Jim Brown just amplifies the insanity, while a carefree, pun-loaded screenplay is only too happy to take advantage. Former Family Feud host Richard Dawson is noteworthy as the conniving silver age comic book villain behind the whole mess, a role he clearly loved playing. Mind-numbingly simple and eye-poppingly profane, it's the best bad movie you'll see all month.

B004RE29WW|3.0|A classic case of too many cooks spoiling the stew, Alien³ isn't necessarily a bad movie, nor is it devoid of potential direction. If anything, it tries to do too much: when Ripley crash lands on a sparsely-populated prison planet, she stumbles into no less than a dozen unique plot points and divergent storylines. Paired with the natural hide-and-seek drama surrounding the alien itself, a closer look at one or two of those may have resulted in a textured, interesting picture. Instead, first-time director David Fincher tries to delve into the lot of them, which often shuffles the alien to the backburner and discovers - after the fact - that they each didn't deserve such a microscopic analysis. That leads to a film with neither a distinct personality nor a purpose which is, often, inconceivably dull. By the time it gets around to wrapping things up, in an admittedly sharp, ballsy climax, the moment is already tarnished and wasted. Even the alien effects, which were so convincing and outstanding in the first two pictures, seem like a watered down afterthought in this chapter.

B0085157B8|3.0|Piranha 3DD is the sequel to Piranha 3D and other than the prehistoric origin of the title critters, it is connected through its use of gratuitous nudity, Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd. The original story has Richard Dreyfus getting killed in the first scene. In this production we are happy to see it is Gary Busey. In the original feature, porn stars provided most of the topless scenes. In this one they opt to use main stream women. Perhaps the first feature should be called 3DD and this one 3D.<br /><br />This story takes place in Arizona where Maddy (Danielle Panabaker) is dismayed that her stepfather (David Koechner) has changed the water park into an adult water park with topless \\"certified\\" strippers acting as lifeguards. Meanwhile the late Gary Busey has released the hideous piranha into the town's lake. So how do we get piranha from the lake into the swimming pools? Christopher Lloyd gives us clues.<br /><br />The movie is a teen sex romp. It has lines which are an adolescent's dream, such as \\"Let's take off all our clothes and go swimming\\" and a few I can't repeat. The van scene was interesting if not sacrilegious. There is an intense lake scene with our heroine and one of the weirdest sex scenes since \\"Teeth.\\" Up to this point I was thinking how much I liked what they did, with some new bits. Then at the climax scene, they made it ridiculous, especially the part with David Koechner.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, full frontal nudity, nudity (Irina Voronina, Cody Kennedy, plus many others)
0345803485|1.0|It's the only thing that can possibly describe the phenomenon. A bad social experiment conducted to better understand the further dumbing down of America. How are there so many people who appreciate this book? I shatter into a million pieces (much like Ana during an unrealistic orgasm marathon) each time I think about the attention this ridiculous book is receiving. The redundancy is infuriating. It's a wonder Ana didn't gnaw her own lips right off her face or Christians hair didn't fall out from constantly running his fingers through it. The only purpose this book could serve (other than kindling for a campfire) is a Sorority drinking game. Each time Ana flushes, take a drink. There would be an alcohol poisoning epidemic so the rule would have to be countered with taking a sip of coffee each time the author uses a \\"Holy\\" in any way.<br /><br />My breath hitches to think about a college graduate in 2011 not having an email address and referring to the only computer she's ever owned as the \\"mean machine\\". She's sheltered to the point of being a 21 year old virgin without email, yet she's willing to allow a sadistic freak beat her into submission with a flogger. And she orgasms each time the wind blows in her direction.<br /><br />I know this wasn't meant to entertain literary geniuses. If this was a fun read for people, there is nothing wrong with that. But I personally wanted to throw the book across the room at least twice per paragraph. And simply don't understand why there are so many people who don't feel the same way. I only finished it because I spent money on it. I will not be continuing because I can't take another page of Ana flushing, shattering, gasping, murmuring, whispering, or finding her equilibrium.<br /><br />Jeez, I'm going to clamber out and find something worth reading while clambering and flushing....as I flush and clamber. Oh my! What a waste of time.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita has an amazing story to tell. Any person who reads this will benefit from it.<br />It is written beautifully and you can feel Anita's loving, peaceful spirit in every word. Anita brings good news to all of us. I urge everybody to read this book.
B0087OXDDC|5.0|Great idea and great book!! This is an indispensable book to improve your knowledge of phrasal verbs . And also is a good thing that you can read the book in your mobile phone with the android app, perfect combination.
B005LAIGZU|1.0|Let me say that again, AWFUL! The acting is deplorable and the story line is unrealistic. I am in the Navy currently and none of this seems believable to me. I could get in to every detail that I found bad about this movie, but I've already given to much of my life away to it already.<br /><br />By all means RENT the movie to see it, but DO NOT BUY IT!!!
B0030IIYYS|5.0|who doesn't love toy story. I grew up watching it and now that I have kiddos of my own they love it as well. I got this for my 3 year old's birthday and she is the biggest toy story fan! I think I might need to purchase another one with as much as she watches her movie lol
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|After a week long struggle to buy this movie which was sold out at every major retailer(in Tampa) I finally got a copy of John Carter. When I started watching the movie the beginning was a little difficult to understand and I wasn't really getting into it. That all changed after watching it for 25mins and i fell  in adulation. When I finished watching JC I was a little saddened to know that there will not be a sequel. On a side note this is a movie that your kids can watch too.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the best games ever. that I played this is the best game ever!!!!!!!. love  this game
0670034711|2.0|I would actually give this book two and a half stars. There were some somewhat interesting parts, but overall I found the book to be pretty boring even though I have connections with two of the three countries written about. The section on Italy was the worst of all. There was absolutely nothing of interest there. India was a bit better and my favorite section was on Bali, even though having been there myself I know she is not accurate in everything she says.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a whole new twist on the game from the 90s! really enjoyable. kind of a mix between Sim city and the sims
B005J7K950|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite films of all time.  Walked into a theatre on a hot day in 1984 and was mesmerized by this film.  This is the perfect example of film as art. And I believe Giorgio Moroder put the perfect musical score into this updated version.  Have seen the original film, but somehow Moroder's version seems succinct and he has perfectly infused rock and roll music to the scenes and emotions of the film. I could watch this film over and over again and never get tired of it.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone -- maybe especially film students.  Watch and enjoy.
B0085LEU02|5.0|Patti Smith has released her best album. Her voice is beautiful and her songs reach into your heart. If you have never listened to any of her music before,this is a 5 star rated album. She writes poetry to make you look at what is happening to our Mother Earth and to us as people. I have read her book and that is where I first discovered her. Unlike most singers who lose their voice as they grow older, her voice is beautiful. The digital book is well worth printing. Her tribute to Amy Winehouse in a song called \\"This Is The Girl\\" is written like a Mother about her own child. Patti Smith is so connected with life and struggles of all who live it. She is a strong woman and is trying to change the world for the better without race, without labels and with all that she carries in her soul.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like this game.  It is very addicting.  fun for hours of enjoyment.  I can play this game for hours.
B00846REIS|2.0|I don't think this book warrants the hype at all. Firstly, there is no story. Secondly, the sex scenes are not hot. Simply having the characters say it's the best sex ever doesn't make me believe it. The two main characters are flat and stereotypical. I didn't like them, didn't care what happened to them, and certainly didn't find myself rooting for them. The secondary characters had much more personality and likability. I won't bother with the following books in the series and would not recommend this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game keeps me intertwined for hours!  love the challenge and how you have to meet the goals. cant wait to keep playing!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Great game that is addictive fun and challenging.  There are periods of frame rate issues which make me crazy but it's just a fun game so I deal with it.  Fix the frame rate and it'll be a 5.  Playing on T-Mobile Springboard.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Read the final installment of this series just so I could have resolution to the story line. All three books could have been combined into one well written story in my opinion. Story was interesting, but sex was redundant and predictable at this point. Paged through many, many pages. Sweet Valley High for adults...
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is the 5th book in the series by George Martin. The characters continue to evolve, sitting on the edge of my seat for most of it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Terrible writing, redundant, still not sure what all of the hype is about. Read entire series hoping it would get better, and while her writing did improve marginally, it was still a waste of my time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW!............  What else is there to say? Absolutley Wonderful!! Dont hesitate to buy this book or either of the other two, they are all Excellent!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This is still not a well written book, but marginally better than the first. Didn't really enjoy it and wish I had refrained from starting this series altogether.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very challenging and very fun! This game is addictive as well. I love all of the different goals to try to get.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I first saw this app on my friends ipad. I was soo excited to be able to get this for my fire! many hours of fun to be had.
B0086700CM|5.0|love this app...fun and addictive....soooo happy its available on kindle now and not just ipad or ipod touch...have been waiting a long time....
B007NESBK2|5.0|Great concert video, one of the best I've seen.  I thought both video and sound quality on my average home theater were excellent.  Sade looks and sounds great, her band tight and can rock when given the opportunity throughout the show.<br />As other reviewers have noted, the well choreographed stage show is what really had me doing double takes.  Along with the typical LED screen behind the stage, on several songs her show incorporates an LED curtain that drapes the front and sides of the stage. With the LED curtain, LED screen, and stage synchronized, it creates an incredible visual that flows with the music.<br />While I did not see her show live, the video is almost better since it captures \\"front-row\\" close-up views of her and the band and also distance views that give the viewer perspective of the whole show.  Excellent!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Crazy love story.  This book drew me in and kept my attention, something that doesn't happen often.  Would not want my 17 year old daughter reading it.  Too explicit for young adults.  Too explicit period....couldn't put it down.
B007G5O3K0|2.0|The cd is OK.  No song is memorable though \\"Burn Money Burn\\" holds my interest over several hearings and will make it to my I-Pod.  Otherwise, Morten isn't really saying anything lyrically or musically with this.  I found this cd a disappointment.
B007VGXS8M|2.0|it was really weird not to have the full page on the screen. it moved really slow on my kindle and it forced me to install a lot of stuff just to get it running.... so if u have money to spend..... I sugest not to use it on this app

030758836X|5.0|You must read this novel.  Be prepared - you will not be able to stop  reading. There are so many twists and  turns in this novel. I am  just in awe of how when it seems you've figured everything out things change. I devoured every page! This is absolutely the best novel I have read this year.

B007V2UGPE|1.0|i read the reviews and hoped the game wasn't that bad. but it is... first of all, it's studip-you don't  even fight the zombies. you can only move the samurai back and forth. stupid!!! and all those comments about the glitches are soooo true. game runs well only through one mini level. i don't understand what do people like about this game.
B00884GR0W|4.0|This game was awezome until I did the update and all my worlds are gone. All the hardwork erased. And it wants me to buy the stupid full version and the lite version at the same time. I already had the full one. THIS IS OUTRAGES. UNTIL THOSE PEOPLE FIX THAT BULL. DO NOT. DO THE UPDATE.
0439023521|5.0|the product is a thrilling novel and i really enjoyed the suspence of the novel and am ambivalent  towards how to describe the wonderful book i just could not put it down after i started reading it the seller did not lie when they said the book was in great condition. the seller was truthful and i would purchase another book from this person.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the ease of navigating... the reading plans... and my Bible is a little beat up... so it is perfect... also having all versions to reference! Love it!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is amusing and quite easy. take your time and enjoy it. several levels passed with little effort. enjoying it. worth the money. words wires word's words
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book was well written , very enlightening.  The pain and suffering that this young man went through is more than any one human should have to endure.<br />It makes a person really appreciate the freedom that we, in the USA were born with, and will die with. I still don't know how the world can let a country on our planet exist like this.  Something should be done to end the suffering in North Korea.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|Good quality.  Easy to put the kindle into it.  At first, I thought that it was kind of an awkward design to stand the kindle up, but OK when I got used to it.  The magnet on one side is a little weak, but I think it was designed that way for the business card holders on the side flap.  Overall I like it, but I miss the elastic of the original one  - it lets you close the case.  The magnets are a nice idea, but I like the elastic because it's firmer.
B000JBWWQ0|2.0|For some strange reason, this DVD will not play on any PC's, laptops, DVD players, or even PS3s. The DVD box states that the DVD was created in the U.S. and made to play in the U.S. I have gone to friend's houses, relative's houses, but to no avail. I cannot play the DVD. I was very excited to have been able to find it since I read the book a few years back. I will have to find this movie by other means. I just wish I hadn't thought I would eventually find somewhere that I could actually play it. Hence why I did not return the DVD in the allotted time to receive a refund.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I was somewhat skeptical of this book only based on the fact that it seems so many books are written about vampires and witches and werewolves for the past few years. But, this book blew me away. I couldn't put it down...aka canceling plans and staying up until the wee hours of the morning absorbing every word in it. One of my favorite, small, points (and it may seem ridiculous) is her descriptions of how the wine that Matthew drinks tasted and smelled. I felt as if I was drinking it myself and of course I was always left craving the wine(s) that she described. I read that this book may be made into a movie and I hope that it is. In the same token I'm nervous that Hollywood will butcher Deborah Harkness' beautiful storytelling. I have already pre-ordered the second book and am literally counting down the days until it comes out! I am especially looking forward to the book being written in the time frame she left us with. This is a book that was worth buying for me because I will read it again and again.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|i don't know where this amazing woman came from, but i began to listen to this album earlier tonight, and her voice, her songs, and her messages resound with the life that so many of us have experienced at one time or another. there aren't many singers who can evoke such emotions, but emeli is one of them. simply gorgeous.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like everything about this app. Of particular value to me are the Bible reading plans, with the ability to listen to them on audio during my commute.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a perfect companion for the avid backpacker or to keep in the drawer at home for quick touch-ups. I especially like that the Pocket Pal accommodates the sharpening of serrated edges. Fantastic product!
0385344228|5.0|I finished this book yesterday, and I can't yet bring myself to start a new one...still thinking about Jacob and his family!  The book is written from his dad's point of view, and I love the way it felt like we were sitting oh, at the bar or some such place, with him telling me the story.  Excellent job by the author of getting that personal feel.<br /><br />He was able to get me attached to all the main characters and to feel empathy for not just Jacob and his mom and dad, but for others who played into the drama.  And the ending has left me wanting a sequel.  Oh, not the kind of ending that leaves me hanging and cranky, but the kind that makes me so attached to the characters that I want to know what happens next.<br /><br />I like a book that makes me think, makes me wonder what I would do in those shoes.  This is a book that will make me think for a long time.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|One of the best series' ever created. A mix of drama, suspense, comedy/dark comedy, and a giant dose of reality when it comes to how a real family is. I love Breaking Bad, the actors are phenomenal, the dialogue is phenomenal, and the story is incredible. You won't waste your time with this series, it teaches you as much as entertains you.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I love this app now you don't have to lug the computer with you when you go out and need to work on word documents excel documents and Powerpoint documents
1407109367|3.0|Awesome book, better than the first! I'm 40 (and mom of 3 boys) and some parts made me laugh a little and some parts actually made me gasp a bit. I don't remember a book EVER stirring up emotions like this one!<br />I totally don't get why it took SO long to get here. It took about 3 weeks. I mean..come on!! It's a book for Pete's sake...how hard is it to ship it within a day or so; so it gets here in at least a week!
B006PTZNSY|1.0|Straight Trash, Nothing Left To Say About This Horrible Album. Nicki should hang up the mic and make duets with all the euro dance singers. Half of this trash is dance music but she can't even sing. Her vocals are so processed, I didn't know it was Nicki half the time. She needs to leave that type of music to Rihanna.
0802473156|5.0|Anyone who will ever be in a relationship needs to read this book.  Had I read it years ago, I might not have been divorced.  I could easily see why the marriage didn't work.  We spoke two different love languages.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great. It let's you compare different translations without having to spend a lot of money at the book store. It even lets you read some hard to find versions. I would recommend it to any serious Bible student.
B006XF5BTG|2.0|Not a big fan. He didn't cover anything special and his methods are actually flawed. Low reps do NOT create the biggest gains
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of the best books I've read.  Faultlessly grows in breadth and depth as the series progresses.  Great writing, great characters.  Very excited to read more of the saga (and other books from Hugh Howley)!  Thanks to Hugh for writing such a great book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this app cant get enough of it. Haven't put my kindle down for hours. Love the fact have to work to open new games because I love a challenge.

B0063IH60K|5.0|faster paced; more automated; such fun!<br />highly recommended to family and friends.<br />I don't know how it could be improved.
B006UG909U|5.0|Really good product,van halen is the best of best's!! State of art CD! and Amazon give me an excelent feed back
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I found this game really fun. having to keep unlocking more games and earning more points means there is always something new to play.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I don't know, I loved it. Only criticism I really heard was that it was a lot like Avatar. Well, it is. But this story came first. And personally, it's a story I wouldn't mind seeing a hundred iterations of.
B004EPYZPS|3.0|This movie is in a class of its own.  It would be difficult to say if this is coming of age movie, drama science fiction or a zombie movie but it is a mix of all for sure.  Set in  1980s it is a story of five high school buddies determined to make their zombie movie.  Bad things happen along the way: one of the boys looses his mother in the accident in a factory where she works; there is an alien on the loose in the small town; and all of these events are interfering with the make of the teeneage zombie movie.<br /><br />It must have been a fun project for Steven Speilberg and his mentoree J. J. Abrams to make.  But do not expect high art.  It is simply a fun movie to watch with no strings attached.
B002RVCD0U|2.0|I had to check I was watching a terminator movie.  Lots of explosions, and lots of explosions.. did i mention stuff blows up constantly?<br />You would think I would have been glued to my seat.. but I got pretty bored with this movie.  And the hybrid terminator that was more advanced than the Arny T101 was built by humans?  And the young Kyle Reese was kind of a dork.  If this was a free streaming movie on Prime I would have stopped watching it, but I paid 2.99 so I decided to see if it got any better.... NO.  It may be useful for like wallpaper background video while you have people over and your cranking some decent music.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a very fun game it is very adikting. if you have anger issues than this game is not the right game for you.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Quick read, really quick if you skip the sex.  Banter between the characters was fun - but got old.  I can't believe it took 3 books to get to the heart of his problems, and then \\"poof - all better!\\"  Filled the bill for keeping my mind busy for a little bit, but difficult to read and not shake my head wondering why I was reading it... but I bought the next book and kept reading.

1594745692|5.0|If you love zombies, campy humor, or 1950s style ads, this is The Zombie Tarot deck for you. The 78 card deck comes in a sturdy box that looks like an ammo box when you are taking off the lid. An instruction booklet is provided for those who want some guidance in how to conduct a reading. A description of the major and minor arcane are included as well - so you will know just what they mean for your reading!<br /><br />At the end of the book there are a few advertisements too. You know - for those items you just know you need like Zombigone: \\"Sufferers From the Walking Death use Zombigone to feel ALIVE again!\\" I'm sure knowing these items are available will come in quite handy.<br /><br />The cards themselves are masters of 1950s style art, with zombies added in of course. A favorite, The Wheel of Fortune, shows a zombie up on a knife-throwing wheel. The description of the card tells you this:<br /><br />  \\"Taking the Wheel of Fortune out for a spin may result in more than a little dizziness. Sure, some things are out of your hands, but you'd be silly to leave your fate to chance. You control more of your destiny than you think. Opportunities are headed your way. Don't try to fight it just go with the flow.\\"<br /><br />Another, the Six of Cups features a precious little girl all dressed up with her little zombie boy friend.<br /><br />  \\"Ahh, the carefree days of childhood! No zombie plagues, no hiding in abandoned houses, and your best friend was always at your side. Well, there's good news: someone from your past may soon arrive for a visit. Just don't mistake a friendly kiss on the cheek for a zombie gnawing off your face.\\"<br /><br />This deck will help you with the undeniable impending zombie infestation or zombie apocalypse if you will. It will guide you in the correct actions and help you remain calm in a time of turbulence. The Zombie Tarot is a \\"prediction/protection\\" resource providing \\"insight and ammunition for surviving the undead uprising\\". Adding this to your stockpile of ammunition and supplies hidden in the basement, attic, or between your walls is a necessity to ensure your future.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.to your stockpile of ammunition and supplies hidden in the basement, attic, or between your walls is a necessity to ensure your future.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.
B0064ORVCQ|1.0|This has surely got to be the worst 3D conversion I have ever seen and I have watched over 150 3d Blu-rays...The film was so dark most of the time that it was hard to follow the film..Poor 3D conversions always lose quality of film and make films look really dark and make the colors dull..Worst Potter films ever 1 AND 2...
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I bought this book, not really expecting a great read; mainly because some of the 5 star reviews that have been on some books are just dreadfully untrue. Truth to tell, I did go to a football game in the midst of reading (had tickets, made promises). However, I had already started reading, so I took my mini laptop with me in case the game got boring. Came home from the game & went straight to bed with mini laptop. Around 1.40am I finally decided to close up for the evening. When I awoke at 7.30am, I was straight back into story (actually, I think I dreamt about the story I had read so far).<br /><br />It was a joy to read the word \\"mum\\" in the story, instead of \\"mom\\". Thank you Anthony Ryan for being English. I am really looking forward to the next in the series, which I understand to be \\"Tower Lord\\". Please, write quickly & in the same style.<br /><br />Again, to anyone looking at this book, I found Raven's Shadow a thoroughly enjoyable romp through a world which was easy to visualize & characters that grew from child to adult; or in the case of the already adult characters, more entrenched in their roles within the story, with steady, organized writing.<br /><br />I can only suggest you read this book & know that you will thoroughly enjoy the time you spend reading it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an awesome game. Is great for the hand eye coordination.  Not only do adults enjoy it but my 8 year old loves it too! Wish it was a little more sensitive with the moves though!
B00125JP1C|2.0|Certainly not for me, or most people who enjoy stories with an actual point. (btw worst first date movie EVER...seriously, don't do it...)<br /><br />Sex and violence is the game of this movie, and honestly, the over the top action scenes got to be a little too much. I can only watch so many guns going off before getting bored. What little romance there was was ridiculously fake and half left me confused.<br /><br />However, if you're in to massive gratuitous amounts of violence, constant action, guns, and death by carrots, go for it. I give it two stars because it's worth watching if you like that sort of thing, and as some other reviewers have pointed out, it is SUPPOSED to be over the top. However, if you're looking for some deep meaning worthwhile movie to watch, look elsewhere.
B005K17RU0|5.0|easy to use. I love the hourly forecast. it's my favorite weather app to use. And it's pretty accurate with its forecasts.
0811879542|5.0|This book is a lot of fun for children as the get to interact with it. The way it is written it makes them feel like they control what happens, that the book reacts to them. My 18-month old loves having us read it to her. We just bought one for my Mom who teaches 1st grade and her kids love it too.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|bad. don't get it. it isn't worth wasting your time on.I don't like this app and I highly suggest not getting it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it and I can't wait to read the other two.  I know numerous people reading this collection and I couldn't take it any more and ordered all three.  I haven't heard one single negative review until I read the postings  here.  I have to laugh when I read them.  One has way too much time on their hands to actually count how many times something was said or written.  Some of the negative reviews you would think they are authors themselves as they sound as if they know how to write a book or best seller much better than the author...anyway...I love this book and look forward to reading the other two.  It is entertaining and sexy and I have to say my heart beats out of my chest reading the \\"hot\\" stuff...wow....get lost in it and don't take it so serious! Geez!  Love it and highly recommend.
0061733199|5.0|This is a really important book in uncertain times. I keep a copy of it in my car, just in case.

B004GYY714|5.0|The best onlain-radio, many station, another janres, and stabil work. The only thing really missing is scrobbling for last.fm. And I would like to automatically localize, as implemented in the google market.

B005LAIHXQ|1.0|What a stunning, totally unexpected letdown for me after anticipating \\"Prometheus\\" for months. It was simply godawful: the screenplay, the casting, the acting (except for Michael Fassbender), the editing, the musical score...all a giant mess. Advance word was that \\"Prometheus\\" was a turkey, but I didn't, could not, believe it. I was wrong.
0525478817|5.0|At one moment I could be over joyed with a huge smile in my face and at the next, balling my eyes out from pure sadness.actually being able to connect in some ways with 16 year old Hazel, the main character, even though she was created by a man, it still astonishes how perfectly he portrayed her. This book is much to good for my words and is much too good for me to want to share it beauty. Fantastic. Phenomenonal. Marvolus.
B00846REIS|3.0|I don't think there is any comparison to 50 shades.  I have been trying to find something to read after 50 Shades and this was the highest recommendation.  I just finished this book Bared to You and  I just felt that it was a book trying to be written like 50 Shades to many similarities.  I will read the next book, but I still thik 50 Shades is waaaay better.
0312430000|4.0|Great book that can be used for many different applications both professional and personal. The book also applies to any industry where there are steps involved. I would recommend this to anyone who has a goal of constant self-improvement.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I like a good trashy novel as much as anyone, but somehow the author relates sex with being hurt.<br />I don't.  Physical love making can be inventive without pain, unless it is a pulled muscle.

B000E6ET1G|3.0|I grew up in the era when these tunes came out so I recognized most of the names of the bands and the songs; but this CD is just not that good. There are only about 1/3 of the songs on this CD that are worth hearing again; that leaves 18 that are not that good. If I had it to do over again I would not purchase this CD.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I loved this book!  Usually I am pretty good at predicting the outcome of a story; however, this book actually caught me by surprise on more than one occasion (and in a good way).  The story has great momentum right out of the gate.  I love the characters in the story and I love that the character's are easy to relate to as they feel and react the same way \\"real\\" people do.  The story ebbs off closer to the third chapter and looses pace but makes a quick recovery after the first few pages.  I will recommend this book to others and impatiently wait for book two.

0984999302|5.0|Why do I call The Startup Owner's Manual \\"Disruption Entrepreneurship?\\"  Well...I was a student at the local college, and I was preparing to graduate with a degree in Business Administration with a specialization in Entrepreneurship, and then the college suggested that I participate in the business plan competition.  I submitted my business plan and a little while later I was subsequently nominated to compete in the business plan competition.  As I was writing the business plan, I must say that I got advice to add \\"creative elements\\" to it.  Honestly, was the business plan supposed to be accurate or just to make some people happy?  As Steve Blank says ...\\"business plans don't survive first contact with the customer.\\"<br /><br />After listening to the audiobook the Lean Startup, the Lean Startup raised some interesting points, and when I pressed my professor about my doubts before the competition, I got a lot of reassurances.  After subsequently getting 3rd place in the competition, I sought to expand what I had heard about in the Lean Startup.  I realized that my product concept was so large and encompassing, that it could be applied to various markets, but which market?  How should it look?  How do I know I'm doing it right?  I had so many questions, and the textbooks simply didn't suggest a good route to go.  They didn't talk of Customer Development, or the Business Model Canvas.  The big question is who are my customers?  This is where The Startup Owner's Manual: The Step-by-Step Guide for Building a Great Company comes into the equation.  This book shows you new ways to go about developing your product, and teaches entrepreneur's the right way to product development.  If I had only known about this a few years ago, I might have saved a lot of money in unnecessary product development costs.  As I build my next round of prototypes, I feel I have a better chance at success, as I can demonstrate what the customers want.  This book is a must have!<br /><br />Here's some more content of the book:<br /><br />As Steve Blank says \\"There Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get Outside.\\"(Rule No. 1)  Go out and interview the customer.  Find out what they want.  Don't wait until the last minute.  You simply don't want to build a product, based upon wrong assumptions.  That's simply a waste of time and money.<br /><br />Rule No. 6 of the Customer Development Manifesto also says: Design Experiments and Test to Validate Hypotheses.  Essentially, you create an experiment to validate your product or target market.  In doing so, you'll learn how to make your product better or where to pivot.<br /><br />These are just a few examples of what's not talked about in the traditional textbooks.
0684857219|5.0|Does this book contain everything you could ever need to know about bodybuilding, as some reviews here have claimed? No. But only because no book has ever covered every piece of information and ideas on their relative subject. I was given this book when I was 16 years old. For the last decade it has been the core of my training literature, no matter what fitness goals I set for myself. I have read dozens of other books in the past ten years on bodybuilding, weight training, and physical fitness. many of them are bad, a good number of them are good, a few are brilliant. I have steadily incorporated all the things I've learned (and always remembered the bad bits) and continually increased the results of my training. It must be said, (and is said in this book) that every person is different, and every body is different. Part of training your own body is learning the unique way in which it responds to training, and designing a training regimen for it. just as no two bodies are alike, no two training programs are either. The programs detailed in this book are meant to be a starting point - a basis that each person can tailor to their own training needs. But even as I've added new or different ideas that I found worked for me, this book has remained the relative center of my training universe. it has never been replaced, just added to, which is exactly how it was meant to be used. This book is not a list of dogma to be followed to the letter. It is a tool, and like any tool, it is meant to be used in whatever way best gets the job done. For those committed to training their bodies, whether to become professional bodybuilders or just regular people looking to improve their physique and quality of life,  it is likely to be the most powerful tool in their arsenal.<br /><br />Simply put, this book is an absolute must.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Scored big time points wit' the little woman for surprising her with this for Mother's Day.  Can't say that I'm a fan, but I don't find it as annoying as some other TV shows she watches.

Then she finds this prince charming from a 14 year old's dreams and falls in love like a 13 year old would fantasize.<br /><br />Not sure if I want to read the other two books. A bestseller? REALLY?<br /><br />Dont read this book. Unless you are a fan of prolonged description of a girl blushing, chewing her lips and orgasming at the slightest, most normal physical contact. The \\"erotic\\" part of the book is more ridiculous than erotic. Worst book I have read in years.

B005LZW8FO|5.0|I have to admit, there are few films that have literally blown me away in the same way that `Another Earth' has.  The combination of unique visual, emotional and dramatic approach have left me somewhat `conformed', completely overwhelmed by the beauty and unexpected poignancy of this little film.  The reviews were strong, the critical reception was telling, the awards recognition was respectable for such a small film and the cult following continues to grow.<br /><br />You can count me in that cult!<br /><br />`Another Earth' is a beautifully sharp character study disguised as a science fiction film.  The film opens with a still of Jupiter and then follows that up with a tragic accident that claims the life of a young woman, her unborn daughter and her son.  Her husband, who was also in that car, survived the crash, spent some time in a coma, and has basically lived his life since a shell of his former self; drinking away his sorrow in his filthy home.  The young woman responsible for the accident, seventeen year old Rhoda who is excited about her acceptance to MIT and completely obsessed with space, has spent four years in prison for her recklessness.  Upon her release, her depression grows and she eventually finds herself placing herself in this man's life in order to `help him' and in a way `help herself'.  The strength of this narrative would suffice in itself, but there is more here that adds to the depth of this story.  Hovering overhead (in beautiful visionary presence) is another Earth, an Earth 2 that was recently discovered (actually, it was discovered on the night of the accident) and it holds within its mystery the prospect of a different future.  As the understanding of that planet becomes clearer and Rhoda begins to contemplate her `other self', the depth of pain is exemplified as the question arises `what if, in another world, you didn't make the same mistakes you made in this one?'<br /><br />Visually, this is just as striking as it is emotionally.  The cinematography is breathtaking, reminding me of 2010's `Fish Tank' in the way that it frames the most intimate of rooms to feel suffocating and in other frames almost uplifting (the floating dust particles is a nice touch), and the visual effect of the `other Earth' is stunning.  Brit Marling is such a find.  Not only did she help pen this story, but her performance is so grounded and revealing and she never lets go of what makes Rhoda tick.  You can feel that pain seep out of her, but you also feel the emotional uplift as she begins to `forget' in order to move on.  William Mapother is also very well used here, delivering a shattering portrayal of a man who has lost everything and is desperately clinging to what he thinks is going to replace that hole in his soul.<br /><br />I'm so excited to see where Marling and director Mike Cahill go from here!The cinematography is breathtaking, reminding me of 2010's `Fish Tank' in the way that it frames the most intimate of rooms to feel suffocating and in other frames almost uplifting (the floating dust particles is a nice touch), and the visual effect of the `other Earth' is stunning.

0307594165|3.0|More of a novella than novel<br />Short but packed with emotion<br /><br />I liked it but wasn't blown away by it.  It was finely written.  It is detailed and descriptive. It was emotive.  But it was maybe a little too lean and sparse to be lyrical or poetic.  It wasn't overly complex, making it an easy read, but I also didn't feel that connected with the characters. The way the story switched narrators (almost The Done Thing in current writing!) was well done.<br /><br />I am trying hard not to compare it to Mudbound by Hillary Jordan but there is a similarity in themes (black poverty in the South, injustice for returned black soldiers) and brevity and I found that Mudbound resonated far more deeply.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|I have a real `love/hate' relationship with `The Fast and Furious' franchise.  I absolutely loved the original when I was like fifteen and still consider it one of the best films in its genre (thus, my five star review).  `2 Fast 2 Furious' was a tad overblown and nowhere near as fun without Vin Diesel.  Still, it had some great moments and I like it.  `Tokyo Drift' made no sense whatsoever and had none of the original cast, so it seemed wholly unnecessary and yet it was far more entertaining than the initial sequel and had a great star making turn (if you call this a `star making vehicle') by Lucas Black, so it was forgivable and certainly enjoyable.  `Fast & Furious' was cheap and ridiculous and a gross underachievement and a major disappointment.  It had almost no merit whatsoever.  After that bitter pill, I was ready to write off `Fast Five' before it was even released.  I mean, as much as I loved the original, do we really need five `Fast and Furious' movies (six now that the sixth film has been greenlit)?<br /><br />Alas, I gave in to temptation (much like I did with that terrible `Transformers' movie) and found out that my expectations were surpassed, in a really good way.<br /><br />The worst thing I can say about `Fast Five' is that it is too long.  The film itself is probably the best in the series, maybe even better than the original, but it needed to be edited slightly.  The ending just drags out, and it doesn't have the level of polish needed to justify an elongated story.  It is similar to 2006's `Casino Royale' in the way that it is expanded storywise, but `Casino Royale' justified it's extensions with sharp development.  `Fast Five' can't do that, because this story lacks the depth it wants to have.  It is fun, but it isn't particularly smart.<br /><br />That said; every other element works really well here.  Having nearly every member from the original and sequels come together for this really big heist in Rio was pretty cool and helped aid in the nostalgic feel (it made me want to rewatch the original) and other aspects of the film really soar, like the crisp cinematography and the visual effects (that train sequence was FLAWLESS).  The acting is decent, Paul Walker still as wooden as ever, but this is Diesel's wheelhouse and so he does what he does better than The Rock.  Seriously, it's a shame that The Rock stole Vin Diesel's career.  It's funny to see them opposite each other.  They are basically the same person and yet Diesel's career, which seemed so promises, has pretty much dissolved and The Rock has arguably received every role Diesel could have and should have gotten.<br /><br />It's fun and exciting and bold and sets us up for the third (sixth) installment that Diesel promises is going to be amazing.  I can't really see how they can take this any further since all five films so far have pretty much consisted of the SAME THING, but this one places all those elements in the best possible order.ostalgic feel (it made me want to rewatch the original) and other aspects of the film really soar, like the crisp cinematography and the visual effects (that train sequence was FLAWLESS).

B004LROUW2|2.0|Tournament of Books, Amazon Best of 2011, highly acclaimed<br /><br />This is one of those books that make you contemplate ...<br /><br />Why is it so highly acclaimed? Why is it so long? What is the point? Why did I finish it?<br /><br />When you look into a kaleidoscope you actually only see one fragment that is \\"real\\" and all the rest of the intricate pattern is repetition ... that is how that book was for me. Yes, there is lots of detail (lots and lots and lots and lots) and it it repeated and repeated and repeated. The detail isn't necessarily important to the plot or characterisation and the repetition is necessarily to emphasis. There were so many, many conversations where the characters simply repeated what the other person just said.<br /><br />One reviewer on Amazon used the analogy :<br />Imagine everything you love about your favorite cocktail; the way the ingredients intermingle, often with hints of flavors that, while unbearable on their own, blend magnificently with others to create a mixed concoction to stimulate even the most nether regions of the human tongue. Now dump your glass into a gallon jug. Fill the jug to the 3/4 mark with water. Then add clam juice, tabasco sauce, maple syrup, nutmeg, and vanilla extract til you get to the top. Voila! You've got 1Q84. Drink it down, consumers.<br /><br />And while I thought of my fractured kaleidoscopic pattern as I read (skipped, skimmed) this book, I think the above analogy is pretty good. There are many good points about the book and the author knits in interesting musical and literary references but it is swamped with so much trivial ephemera. While a reviewer called it \\"complex and surreal\\", I am more with the one from The Onion that called it \\"stylistically clumsy with layers of tone-deaf dialogue\\". I think the repetition made it simplistic and scrambled.<br /><br />BUT ... having now force fed myself with 1Q84, I will, when I have the chance, go back and read others by the author (reviews by fans suggest that this was not the one to start with!).
B003G4W49C|4.0|There were a few times I wish the story had gone in different directions but overall I really liked it.

0393080269|4.0|Changes are continuing to surprise.  Countries that grew at a fast pace during the last decade will slow down but see steady growth.  The US will continue to lead in  technology<br />innovation where there is a climate for such growth.  And if some countries continue to reform they will be forging a new strength in their economies.  These and other trends<br />are documented by the author.  The book is nice for an over view of global trends that are worth watching.  For those desiring to get such an over view, the book will not disappoint.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is soooo fun and i am sooo happy that we gpt it on tje kindle. i have been wating forever!!!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This was a lot of fun and there was much admirable about it in terms of creating a fantasy world that was realistic without being cookie stamped CG effects. The high tech was made to support the story wonderfully rather than to exhibit itself and flaunt \\"wow -- high tech.\\" That is okay too. I just saw Prometheus and loved the CG and based on that enjoyed the film despite very weak acting and embarrassing script. John Carter had a decent script and decent acting and with the great settings and characters combined it worked.<br /><br />If I were rating the critical professional critics I would give them one star rather than zero. The one star would be for meaty nit picking. Sure they found things to complain about that \\"one could.\\" Why they bothered to get into a snit fit  over the sorts of problems they dragged out is curious. One almost gets the feeling they were trying to second guess each other. Phew!! Glad I didn't let them scare me away from the film. It may not be the Hope Diamond but it is a small gem. So, okay, maybe not for everyone.<br /><br />Okay Carter was not on the edge of your seat Terminator etc. etc. It was cute and nostalgic for old fashioned science fantasy and quite well enough done. I want to read the novel. I wish the DVD had more features that SHOWED how they did the make up special effects etc. The director/producer commentary was above average but left me wanting to see how they did some of their tricks. I hope there is a sequel and maybe they will add this sort of special feature.
B007JUWM64|2.0|I watched only 30 minutes of the \\"Three Musketeers\\" before being driven away by all the strutting egomaniacs.  For a movie to get 3 stars or more, it has to be at least good enough to keep me watching the whole thing!<br /><br />A tip to film-makers who want their films to be popular: give the \\"Good Guys\\" some likeable qualities.  Make them human, don't make them utterly invincible, and even give them a few weaknesses.  Most people don't like pompous, invincible, cocky egomaniacs, if they are supposed to identify with them as the Good Guys.  In the \\"Three Musketeers\\" it seems as though the whole cast is full of arrogant megalomaniacs.  It's just that the 3 \\"good\\" Musketeers are the smiling, ultra-confident type of egomaniac, while the bad guys are the frowning, evil type.  And then there's the \\"boy\\" Musketeer, D'Artagnan, who seems to be a cocky teenage superman (extremely unlikeable), and the female lead, named \\"Milady,\\" is the cocky, back-stabbing, sexy type (also very unlikeable, although she is on the Dark Side).  Then, of course, are various other types of bad guys, the worst being, of course, the Cardinal, who is a hypocritical, religious egomaniac, and the evil Rochefort, who is a nasty egomaniac.  30 minutes into this thing, I realized that I didn't like any of the characters.<br /><br />Then there's the gimmicky, \\"gadget\\" flavor to the movie, where, for example, a Musketeer dispatches about 5 soldiers with some sort of whirling machine-gun crossbow.  The gimmicky gadgetry seems silly & distracts.<br /><br />But when the Musketeers along with D'Artagnan are surrounded by about 50 soldiers, and then proceed to easily slaughter them (D'Artagnan acrobatically dispatching about 20 himself), I had had enough.  I had to quit watching it.  I was really cheering for the soldiers to get in some good sword licks on some of those cocky jerks.  Maybe even dispatch one, or at least make them sweat.  Nope, all the poor soldiers were bascially cannon-fodder for the Supermen Musketeer Assassins.  Perhaps better actors could have made me care more about their characters.  When you start rooting for the \\"bad guys\\", it's time to give it up.
B007UXTG8M|4.0|Watched \\"Shame\\" and I was speechless. It sucked the life right out of me. I felt like I needed to get out and take a long drive and breathe in some fresh air and then take a few showers and scrub myself down.<br /><br />My mind was in overdrive making up all sorts or scenarios for how these characters ended up so screwed up. The film score was haunting and the acting was superb. Loved the way it was shot. Steve McQueen really made this film seem like I was spying on someone's private life.<br /><br />Something breathtaking in the movie was the rendition of \\"New York, New York\\" sung by Carey Mulligan. I don't know if she really sang the song or not, but wow, what an incredible and poignant rendition.<br /><br />This is not a movie to take lightly, and it shows the brutal reality of what can happen to you when you let things in your life get out-of-control. Will you be able to stop them? Most people never know if they can until it's too late.<br /><br />My heart hurts after watching it.<br /><br />Side Note:  This movie is rated NC-17 for good reason. I must say that Michael Fassbender does an excellent job of looking very comfortable while VERY naked.
030758836X|5.0|I love it when I'm reading, and that thing I thought early on might happen but seemed way too clever and elaborate to actually happen, happens.<br /><br />When I hit that spot in 'Gone Girl' - about halfway in, when the book went from \\"very good\\" to \\"amazing\\" - I couldn't sit still, I couldn't keep quiet about it, and I couldn't wait to turn the next page. And the next one, and the next one, in a race to the finish.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn starts out strong in 'Gone Girl,' telling the story of a wife who disappears under mysterious circumstances from two perspectives and from two different points in time. It's a confident story, written in an elegant, no-nonsense style and with character voices that feel very real. It helps that both of the narrators of the story are writers, which makes the occasional flourishes of language and description fit right in.<br /><br />And then I got to that point, the point that I had considered early on but thought it too complicated to come to pass - and there it was, the moment that everything I had read so far was called into question.<br /><br />What comes after is no less compelling, but with the added element of doubt becomes addicting. What seemed strong characters at first become complex and multifaceted, with hidden layer after hidden layer, which Flynn peels away steadily and deliberately. Flynn also finishes well, with an ending that is both satisfying and ambiguous, leaving enough open to the reader's interpretation to make the story feel expansive - to make me feel a part of it, a willing participant in a magic trick that had me thoroughly fooled.<br /><br />'Gone Girl' is one of the best books I've read this year, a little piece of dark sorcery that kept me glued to its pages and kept me thinking about it after I was done. It begins well, twists and turns repeatedly, and finishes just as strong.<br /><br />It's rare that a book will keep me under its spell this thoroughly from start to finish. But I love it when it happens.ens.

B0083GR6Y6|2.0|Even though I kind of knew what this movie was about, I was really, really disappointed.  It wasn't much more than a rip-off of \\"Alive\\" and \\"Frozen\\".  Frankly, there was just nothing original about it, nor was it very realistic.  Plane crashes in arctic, wolves hunt survivors. My personal favorite has to be the fact that in the movies, people seem to be able to survive being submerged in icy water for extended periods of time, emerge dripping wet in subzero temperatures and yet continue to plod on.  Yeah, yeah, I know... it's just a movie!
B007SSEBCU|1.0|This movie is so disappointing..i was looking forward to seeing this movie because I admire Margaret Thatcher so much.  I was disappointed in Meryl Streep for portraying Margaret Thatcher as a demented old woman, instead of the strong world leader that Margaret Thatcher was. It is disgusting to me to see Margaret Thatcher portrayed this way. Hollywood obviously disliked Margaret Thatcher's conservative politics so they chose to  portray her this way. It shows how morally bankrupt Hollywood is when they cannot tell the truth about one of the truly great women leaders in the history of the world.
B007MJKOY4|2.0|I sat through this mediocre piece of cinematography twice.  The first time, I was lost 30 minutes into the film and I never found the exit.  Having never read the book, it was virtually impossible to figure out what was going on.  So, I read the plot summary on Wikipedia and decided to give it another go.  The second time, I finally got the gist of what was going on, but the film never does much more than plod along.  Very disappointing since the trailers present a rather fast-paced spy thriller -- which this movie, sadly, was not.

B007SGM084|5.0|These are the best books that I have ever read:) I normally read murder/courtroom drama's. However I am now leaning towards 50 Shades genre.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|does great in the grocery store when you are on a budget as I am. Keeping up with prices, its the best.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I discovered Joe Bonamassa when a favourite author mentioned listening to his music on her blog. I bought \\"Don't Explain\\" cd as it was a collaboration with my favourite singer Beth Hart.LOVE it. Then he releases his next cd where the last song has Jimmy Barnes doing an oldie but a goodie of his own.  Damn it, I'm going to have to buy this one as well!!!<br /> Jimmy Barnes is originally from Scotland but has resided in Australia for years and years. He has toured New Zealand (where this review is being written) many a time and has had a lot of top twenties on both sides of the Tasman.<br /> Bonamassa and Barnes, Bonamassa and Hart...both cds are worth the purchase... Joe, do a Bonamassa, Hart and Barnes - Blues equivalent of Heaven on Earth

0812550706|5.0|...is taking the different strategy parallels Ender employs and transcribing it to my business model.  A must read for any science fiction fan or business \\"Art of War\\" strategist.
B002RI9TB4|5.0|Half of a Yellow Sun is a beautifully written revelation of how life can unravel when the political landscape changes. It should be compulsory reading for all those who believe that things can't fall apart.
B000IOM0X8|5.0|This is a good clean movie. One that you will enjoy no matter your age and you can watch with the kids.

B007PS0DTI|4.0|If you loved the Underworld series, you will love this one. Celine is mad and you do not want to be between her and her goal. Lot of action and a good story.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run. It's so adicting. I could run on it all day.I think that if I don't die every second I might be able to create a world record.The demons are kind a scairy but their suposed to be right?
B00881VLCE|5.0|The puzzels have different sizes that could entertain anyone.  I sit and do them with my children.  My son is challenged and he just loves to do them. I recommend this app if you want something easy and fun.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed all the books of Fifty Shades. They were interesting and suspenseful.  The only downfall I see to these books is not getting my housework done until I completed the books.  I just couldn't put them down.
030758836X|1.0|Could not get past the second chapter... Very stupid and poorly written and going nowhere.<br />Blah blah blah blah blah.
B004I744AS|5.0|Superb app. I wasn't happy with the default dictionary on the kindle fire, so I tried a few dictionary apps out and this one blew all the rest away. User friendly, excellent layout, quick response time and great extras. Hands down the best dictionary app out there.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This is probably the best game out there. I just wish they had a bluetooth system in it so we can play nearby opponents.-jvprint.com
B00799L3OM|5.0|Another Yanni masterpiece! Although I would've liked to see more imagery from the Island of Puerto Rico, Yanni delivered a one of a kind concert with very unique interpretations of Nightingagle and a Harp Solo that leaves one wanting more. This was a great production and I would recommend this CD/DVD 100%
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|The greatest strength - one of many - in \\"Prometheus\\" is that it is decidedly not another \\"Alien\\" movie. It's a film that exists entirely in its own framework, only borrowing elements from the series and hinting at things that would happen in other films.<br /><br />While \\"Prometheus\\" is clearly a prequel to the \\"Alien\\" franchise, I now understand why Ridley Scott has said multiple times that it's not a \\"direct prequel\\" to the series. It's not like last year's \\"The Thing,\\" which literally ends to lead into the opening shots of the 1982 classic. \\"Prometheus\\" sets the stage for \\"Alien,\\" yes, but it leaves plenty unexplained.<br /><br />So if you're expecting a retread of Ridley Scott's original monster movie in space, you'll be sorely disappointed. And that's why I think some reviews of the film are coming in so soft.<br /><br />But what were you really expecting? Even a quick glance over Ridley Scott's filmography shows that he doesn't tread the same ground twice. Even films like \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Kingdom of Heaven,\\" which share a lot of themes and elements, are entirely different movies. Why would anyone expect \\"Alien: The Prequel - The Tragic Journey of the Space Jockey\\"?<br /><br />At it's heart, \\"Prometheus\\" is a grand piece of speculative fiction, which opens some thought-provoking doors as to humanity, our beginnings, morality and immortality. It's the story of a scientific vessel traveling to a distant planet to discover our extraterrestrial ancestors. However, upon arrival, the crew finds some terrifying things and uncovers some unpleasant secrets about our origins.<br /><br />I won't say anything more than that, but rather will let the film sit for itself. Things in \\"Prometheus\\" need to be revealed by the film, not by trailers, marketing and spoilery reviews. Yes, there are bits and pieces you will recognize from the \\"Alien\\" universe, but it gives a very different view of that universe.<br /><br />Noomi Rapace holds her own as the lead of the film, playing abit of a precursor to Ellen Ripley. Her character is tough, adorable and complex, and she can be both the victim and the hero. She is supported by a strong cast that includes Charlize Theron as the corporate bigwig driving the mission, Guy Pearce as the aging benefactor and Idris Elba as the overly cliched but still enjoyable pilot.<br /><br />Still, the star that outshines Rapace in this film is Michael Fassbender as David, they synthetic human keeping control of the ship. (Yes, there's gotta be one of those in every movie, it seems.) Fassbender has been impressive in both indie and mainstream films lately, and here's another feather in his cap. It's an understated role, but like any great character, there's as much in what he doesn't say and do as is in what he does.<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" is best enjoyed is a relative vacuum from the franchise that left Scott's hands more than 30 years ago. It's good to be familiar with the films, but it's best to expect a grand space journey along the lines of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" with teeth and less psychedelic drugs. It is not quite what you'll expect, and it's a better film for it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|my expectations were surpassed  by a wonderful story of unconditional love ! i highly recommend this book for the reader looking for a love story but  you must read the first 2 or you will never understand this book
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome game and you should try it out cuz it is like and adventurous game for you to play
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I was hoping to buy the Kindle version, but then I noticed that it was $2 more than the paperback version.  Why is the Kindle version more expensive than the paperback version?  I can understand if it is priced the same or less, but more?  Forget it. I realize that it is most likely the publisher's fault and not Amazon's, but unfortunately, neither Amazon nor Brooks will be getting a share from my sale.  I will ask my daughter to pick it up at the library instead.
B003E74B24|1.0|I enjoy Chef Ramsay and respect him quite a bit.  However this book did not do it for me.  It is obvious he is a driven man. Perhaps I did not enjoy this book so much because I have the opinion that people who only care for work and money, which is the focus of the book, are not my cup of tea.  I prefer people to be more introspective and less.... focused on \\"stuff\\". I think being so focused on money and what it can buy is a large problem in the Western world. I am still a fan. Just not of this book.
B0086700CM|5.0|from the moment I downloaded this game I found it hard to put down. the gameplay never gets old. this is a good ap to get especially since it is free. trust me you won't be dissapointed.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|I purchase about 3 new albums a year and have never reviewed an album before.  I bought this album yesterday after seeing her on the Colbert Report.  I have listened to the whole thing 3 times already.  Wow. Love her voice and style.  This is my kind of music.  Kudos.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is the game that I get and play multiple games in one. it is one of the biggest games on the kindle fire. it is also one of the best.
B000HF2NF8|5.0|Huge fan of the movie and even more importantly the message behind it. Very applicable to what's going on in the U.S. now.  As far as the collectors edition go's; it's nicely put together, but I was expecting the mast to be a full size mask as opposed to a miniature.
B003R0MF5S|3.0|If you're looking for CHUCK Season 4, then you probably know about what the series was all about. It's okay fun, certainly much better any of those lousy, mindless reality shows. And certainly worth seeing Yvonne Strahovski, one of the most beautiful actress in recent years! Apart from that, not worth paying one penny more than the 40$ for the Blu-ray version.
B00499K9E0|5.0|This is the best thing I have ever seen on television.  Brilliantly done in all respects - acting, writing, filming. . .  I could go on.  But what really makes this show special is the fact that, unlike any other Sherlock interpretation I've seen to date (I don't confess to having seen them all), this one really gets Watson right.  Freeman's Watson is no bumbling toady as we typically see.  Rather, he is a force to be reckoned with. He may be humble, but he is also a bad-ass.  He is the perfect foil for Cumberbatch's acting acrobatics, quietly deflating him with a glance or a single word.  By the end of a Study in Pink, you know exactly why Sherlock relies on Watson so heavily and why Watson loves every minute of it.  Kudos to creators Moffatt and Gatiss for giving priority to the extraordinary friendship of these two characters, rather than the mysteries themselves. Watching Cumberbatch and Freeman is an absolute joy. Series 2 only gets better.  If you are a prior Sherlock Holmes fan, you will love the way that Moffatt and Gatiss have taken so much from the Holmes canon and turned it into something new and wonderful.  If you are not a prior fan, this will turn you into one.  I am now an avowed Sherkophile.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|very good and easy to use calculator. I like how big the numbers are. My kids like using it too.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this book after Amazon suggested it based on my reading habits. I looked at the description based on the title and the cover. I BOUGHT it because it had garnered so many great reviews.<br /><br />And I am reviewing it (and TOTALLY recommending it to you now) because it is top notch sci-fi. It does what great sci-fi should do: create a world where fantastic things seem real, create characters that we can't live without, and wind the plot tighter and tighter.<br /><br />A lot of reviews on this site give you a five paragraph book report (occasionally containing spoilers). I won't do that here, because I refuse to ruin your enjoyment of this book. Part of what's great about the book is that you don't know what will happen yet, unless some dweeb on Amazon wrote a damn paper for their 'review' of the book.<br /><br />Instead, I'll just tell you that if you like dystopian fiction, apocalyptic fiction, strong characters, unique speculations about what the future will look like, survivalist fiction, rebellion and a low-key approach to romantic situations (i.e. sure, somebody loves somebody else, but it isn't their driving force; this isn't Twilight, you know), you will love this book.<br /><br />Howey's writing is tight. He keeps the plot moving forward. He creates characters that you can *worry* about, which will keep you turning pages. You won't regret buying this book for one second, and you can rest easy knowing that when you buy a book from an indie author like this one, the vast majority of funds go to him. That's called patronage, folks, and it's what keeps true artists making art!
1612130283|1.0|Seriously, when she refers to him as \\"Fifty\\" all I can picture is 50 Cent. BLANCH.<br />All the other reviews are spot on. This book is laughable.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Works really good. I like the history aspect. Really big display. Buttons are big too. For .99 this is a good app to have.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|wounderful games. cant stop playing. so different games to choose from. you'll find games u played as a kid. very additive.  no problems with it at all.
B001DHXT2U|5.0|I like the bag its comfortable and perfect for a camera with an extra lens and filters and stuff.  the only part i dont like is the tripod strap isnt all that great it can slip out.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|I've played their free version for quite a while and was happy to see the full version come up as the free app of the day. The UI is easy to use, and the game is quite customizable. Yes, it has Open Feignt, but it prompts you to enable/disable right away, so you don't have to load it at all. Flurry is enabled by default, but that can be disabled in settings.<br /><br />For an easy to control sudoku game, with unlimited puzzles, this one is a good one.
B0078N2T8I|5.0|I see a lot of people who have given this movie bad reviews for being slow or boring.  Go watch Avengers.  This is a movie for people that like to out themselves in the place of the characters. It will make you uncomfortable for the whole 2 hours in the best way possible.  I knew nothing of this movie when I saw it and I'm glad.  Once of the most intense and emotional movies I have ever seen. The feelings this piece conjure up will stay with you for days!
0525423656|2.0|This book is the epitome of what's wrong with the current trend of writing trilogies when a story doesn't warrant that sort of treatment.<br /><br />MATCHED, the first in this series was a good book. A good story that, let's face it, was heading toward a conclusion. Had Ally Condie added about 50-100 more pages I'm guessing there could have been a solid story with an enjoyable, perhaps even gratifying conclusion.<br /><br />Instead we get CROSSED, which can be summed up in these two words: They wander.<br /><br />This is a book in which nothing happens. Oh that's not entirely true, the main characters Cassia & Ky leave all the characters we met in the first book (with the exception of Xander who pops in for a quick visit) & we meet some new characters, most of whom matter so much to the progression of the story that they leave before this book is finished. So we're back to Cassia & Ky wandering with their angst about whether or not they should be together. Sounds like fun right? Right.<br /><br />It's not that it was poorly written- it wasn't. It was just filler.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Free app of the day, but well worth 0.99. Want more levels!  13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I enjoyed this compilation volume of \\"Wool\\". I found it generally well-written and interesting. I'm impressed by the quality; especially given it is a self-published work. Well done, Mr. Howey.<br /><br />I really appreciated the world-building here. I also appreciated the genius of releasing a couple short stories in the \\"Wool\\" universe and expanding on that with later novels. Great strategy.<br /><br />That said, I'm glad I bought the omnibus, because I think I would've been miffed if I'd only bought the first story alone thinking it was a full book. But as a full-length novel in five parts, the \\"Wool\\" omnibus works quite well. It doesn't have the standard slow rise until the climax that most novels have, but the final climax is big enough, and the world and characters interesting enough, that it doesn't particularly matter. Think of this more as a \\"Martian Chronicles\\" work, where five individual stories paint a larger narrative and together explore a world.<br /><br />All the stories in the omnibus are brooding, character-based stories, by the way. So if you're looking for non-stop \\"Star Wars\\" action, this isn't the place.<br /><br />Still, \\"Wool\\" is a good addition to the sci-fi genre. My only criticism would be the sparse character and place description in the first couple books. Description is important. The more foreign the place, the more description a reader needs to \\"see\\" it.<br /><br />All in all this is a fun series, though. I recommend it.<br /><br />And don't bother buying individually. Just spring the five bucks for the omnibus. It is worth it.
0446530573|5.0|The stories and recipes are so Southern Italian, I felt right at home. Gave the books for Christmas and it's still a book I refer to for a couple of favorites that I didn't have any recipe for. You know, if you're Italian, recipes are all 'in the head' and passed down.<br />So, discovering some favorites with measurements, etc. was worth the purchase.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|Recommendation: Expect to pay an extra $5 if you plan to use most common fonts. Otherwise, the software seems functional.    Pros:  -Functioning Office Software    Cons:  -Tries to charge for common fonts such as Calibri, Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica  -It is always running    At first glance, getting this app for $1 seemed like an incredible deal (1/15th of the usual price) considering it was a 4 star office suite. Without looking into it too much, I purchased it (my fault, I know). The company opted to leave out some of the most common fonts and charge $5 for them. They let you know that you're not getting all of the pie you paid for the first time you open the app. When you click to download the update they request to charge you $4.99. To me this screams, bait and switch.    UPDATE: 4/16/13    -Removed critique of permissions after seeing the reasons permissions are used. See link here for explanation (scroll to bottom):  [...]  -added a star to rating to reflect the fact that I believe there is one less major issue with this software.
B0076L9W9Q|4.0|Her voice has quite a range, being able to do anything from soft & sensitive to screaning as well as any hard rocker.  She can scream like a real bitch, which isn't a bad thing!<br /><br />Their first album was good & their second effort is every bit as good.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Ms. Flynn's first book was superlative. Her second was befuddling. I don't even know what to say about this one. It starts out with a bang, the reader is drawn into the creepy everyman charm of the lead character Nick. His brittle sardonic wry commentary on his failings and foibles, his descent into mediocrity in Missouri (a fate worse than death). His irreverent relationship with his formerly beloved wife, who apparently has crashed from her former pedestal and is now an object of distaste. Did he do away with her? I couldn't turn the pages fast enough I couldn't put it down. Then shriek crash a 180 degree turn and we're careening off in a new direction. Hang on what goes here! And then...a gradual decline. By the time I got to the end I so thoroughly disliked just about every single character, most particularly the two protagonists, that I just wanted it to be over. It reminded me very strongly of War of the Roses, a good character study of a selfish venal vindictive couple. As they swing to their final crashing interlocked fate you are thinking did two people ever deserve each other more.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I am not going to waste any more of my time with this book so this is going to be a brief review. \\"Holy Crap\\" it was bad!  The writing was beyond poor (yes we worked out he had grey eyes and didn't need to be reminded 412 times), the characters were obnoxious, the sex was repetitive and cringe-worthy...my \\"inner Goddess\\" wasn't sure whether to laugh, throw up or aim the book at the nearest bin (or a combination of all options). Good luck to the author as she is raking in the $$. But I absolutely hated it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app was very much talked about and I had to try it. I can say I am so addicted to it. its a very hard but thrilling game. I highly recommend it to all who see it.

0312641893|3.0|I am almost sick to death of fairytale retellings. No, not true -- of Cinderella retellings. Sometimes it's as if YA authors have forgotten any other fairytale exists. I picked up \\"Cinder\\" anyway -- why? Because of the scifi angle and the Chinese cultural influences promised in its setting of New Beijing. I thought, well, THAT'S new and different, that's a promise of creativity and original thinking on the part of the author, and perhaps such a person is actually capable of injecting new life into this oft-retold story.<br /><br />But no dice.<br /><br />The science fiction is cute, but not very smart or integrated. There's an implacable prejudice against cyborgs -- regular humans who were given life-saving measures requiring mechanical limbs and other cyber enhancements. Why? There doesn't seem to be any particular reason, which is odd given their second-class citizen status and how they're drafted for experimental testing. We meet Lunars, an alien race capable of influencing the thoughts and emotions of those around them, a people who are clearly inhuman and yet... evolved from a human lunar colony? WHAT? Evolution does not work that way. Suffice to say, a lot of the science fiction elements come off as flimsy and decorative rather than thoughtful world-building. It's a disappointment, but it doesn't doom the book.<br /><br />What was particular damning, given my initial hopes, was the all-out mucking up of Chinese culture. The elements Meyer injects are either the kind you could pick up by walking through Chinatown -- lucky dragons, dumplings, chopsticks, pagoda roofs -- or simply wrong. Meyer uses -mei and -jie as if they were interchangeable with \\"Miss\\" and \\"Mrs,\\" which. No. That's not how it works. Seriously, picking up a Mandarin phrasebook would have explained at least that much. WIKIPEDIA explains that much. Also, no one in this book has a Chinese name, and it's clear from certain character descriptions that few of them (if any?) are actually Chinese. Prince Kaito might be, but take another glance at that name -- that's a Japanese name! In fact, there are quite a few Japanese-sounding names in this book. Plus someone wears a kimono. (ARGH.) Meyer proudly proclaims her love of the TV series \\"Firefly\\" in her bio, which might be where she got the idea that you could have a supposedly Chinese culture with so few Chinese people, or mangle the language with impunity, or mash together Japanese and Chinese elements and no one would notice -- but that does not make it okay.<br /><br />But what if you're not like me, and you don't give a hoot about whether the scifi holds up under scrutiny or the Chinese setting is anything but thoughtless appropriation. Is the story itself any good?<br /><br />Well, yes and no.<br /><br />The characters are not great. There is a strong whiff of Fanfiction Syndrome: characters fall in love without much pretense, certain characters are awful and mean without explanation, others are sweet and loving while lacking the same. There was also a tendency to sacrifice characterization for the chance to deliver snarky one-liners. This kind of thing sometimes works in fanfiction because you not only expect the characters to act certain ways, you actively WANT them to, and you don't need the build-up -- but with original fiction it can be confusing and lacking in emotional grounding. Honestly, it's hard to avoid comparison with fanfiction if you're at all familiar with the Sailor Moon universe. I'm not saying Meyer didn't make the setting her own, but the influence is really, REALLY strong, to the point where I was playing the \\"which Sailor Moon character would this be?\\" game.<br /><br />Yet I've still given it three stars -- why? Because with all its faults (and I'm legitimately angry about the screwed-up Chinese stuff), there's a definite joie de vivre to the book. The pacing is absolutely aces, and even if you don't find yourself particularly caring about the characters, even if you spot plot twists from page 20, Meyer is really good at maintaining the narrative tension in a way that makes the pages turn almost by themselves. I finished this book in two long, glorious gulps. Was it anything but an entertaining distraction? No. But it was fun while I read it.<br /><br />By the end of \\"Cinder\\" we've covered about 5/6ths of the original tale. Apparently Meyer plains to cover other fairytales in order to draw out this series over three more books, and I'll admit I'm curious to see what she does with them, even with my disappointments. There is some definite potential in this book's ending, and a promise to go darker and deeper than the usual happily-ever-after. Meyer has failed to live up to most of her promises in \\"Cinder,\\" but I'm willing to give her another chance.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read so many books that I just don't have time to do reviews; however, I feel the need to stick up for E.L. James in a rather big way, so, hence the review.. The fuss over this book is, it MADE it to the New York Times Bestseller list, so haters, go'way.<br /><br />I am not a teenager; I am not Anastasia's age.. I am closest to Mrs. Robinson's age, most likely, but still, I went right along with Ana as she fell in love for the first time. The author is British, and I did kind of give up and pretend that Ana and Christian are Brits living in Seattle. Their daily actions and dialogue flowed better that way, and it worked for me to do that. This is the first book E.L. James has written. She lives in London, and she writes with the dialogue that she grew up with. Deal with it, it's quite cute! I am sucked into this book series, and I will read it to the end.<br /><br />Let's throw out the things that EVERYONE here, AD NAUSEUM at that, is pointing out. The author has surely read and/or watched Twilight, The Reader, and 9 1/2 Weeks. Call it writers' inspiration, if you will. It takes one to know one.. we writers get our inspiration from other writers we like, and from movies we see. So leave her alone about it, sheesh. What has drawn me in to this Trilogy is the fact that I thought and felt so much like Ana did about her strange relationship with Christian. I GOT her, and that's a cool thing to have happen when reading a book. Ana is a perfect ingenue/steely heroine, and the reader shadows her life and her thoughts quite well. Christian is mysterious, wounded, bizarre at times, and the reader tends to agree with most of the decisions that Ana makes regarding him. And the erotica.. well, not exactly my thing, but it's this writer's prerogative to have as much as she wants of it. I see it as a necessary part to this story's plot, so I just went along with what E.L. James wanted to say. I'm just not getting what people are gaining from slamming her in book reviews on Amazon. Fifty Shades of Grey is an interesting, quirky, dominant read. I'm sure Christian would be irked that I didn't call it a submissive one. :)

B004CFA93M|3.0|This was my first Jane Austen experience, and it turned out to be mostly what I expected.  Flowery writing, wandering storyline, and mostly emotional drama, this is not at all like my typical reading fare.  That being said, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was an enjoyable read, with undeniably beautiful prose and often biting social commentary of old British society.  While Elinor and Marianne didn't face any life-threatening scenarios or experience any true danger, their experiences trying to attract mates while navigating the social maze of British aristocracy was nonetheless interesting and amusing.  The ridiculousness of that society when compared with our norms of today is spectacular.  When an entire class is judged by nothing more than the family coffers, and labor seems unthinkable, marriage is of the utmost importance, especially for those unlucky 2nd and 3rd born children who are unlikely to inherit the estate.  It seems totally bizarre today, but this kind of thing was apparently the norm a couple of hundred years ago, and is actually quite fascinating to think about (and learn about) while reading this book.  And while we still have some elites today, it is hard to imagine the massive social divisions, bigotry, and unequal opportunity of the past.  Jane Austen succeeds in her goal of highlighting the wrongs and inconsistencies of old British society.  This book is worth the read if you have the time, even if mostly for the stark comparisons it provides with current times.

It is cute and definitely a teen love story but I can see myself reading it again in the future. I also cant wait to start reading the other books in the series.

I thought it was an interesting concept and I found it because I was researching the lead actor, Andy Whitfield, and I was very sad to find out he passed away last year(2011) from cancer. I first enjoyed his acting watching Spartacus, And when I found he had been replaced I decided to find out what other movies he was in. All in all I thought this movie was worth buying, and was very well done for the budget it had.
