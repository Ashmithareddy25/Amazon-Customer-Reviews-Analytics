B000WO6I3W|5|very , very  impressive gift..it is not for everybody...ecxellent combinations of  flowers...just GREAT..!!
B000BZXTS4|5|I've been searching high and low for Obsession dusting powder,  and I'm afraid as of Christmas of '09 it is no longer being produced.
B005WKFS6E|5|Good stuff for colored hair!
B002TPO0W8|3|I got it all happy then barely used. That's mainly my fault but it's the truth. Do like the colors so it's fun when I try new eyebrow colors.
B004Y9GZRK|5|Love it.
B00KERBOA4|5|Not greasy, my skin feels amazing!! Will definitely buy again!!! A must have!
B00MC8QAPM|3|Not bad.  Does what it is made to do. Takes a short time to get the hang of how to use it. You can buy them from local beauty supply store for much cheaper. Was worth the buy just to hear my 6 year old daughter hand one to her aunt and say, &#34;Here you go auntie. This is for your mustache&#34;.
B004EEJPFY|4|I read other reviews that said these were too thick to be used at all. Generally glitter polishes are thick and harder to work with, unless you buy the expensive ones. It takes a bit of practice and a lot of patience but you can get beautiful results with these polishes. I am happy with them for the price I paid.
B005FK3M46|5|The images are crisp and clear.  They stamp beautifully.  Lots of unique images.  Great overall quality, I definitely am glad to have these in my collection.  And a great price too!
B003UJHSUI|5|I can feel it working un like other cellulite creams I've used... I like this one very much
B000AN00W0|5|I have long searched for a product like this.<br />My stylist recommended this and I am hooked!!!<br />It has restored the luster back to my hair.
B00FIY93SI|5|My favorite scent so far.  I've ordered several from this company, and they've all been great.
B00A8PFN90|5|My husband and I both love this lotion.  It's not too runny, and not too thick.  It has a nice, light citrus scent that is pleasant for both men and women.
B000AMDOAQ|5|Love these Aquis towels, both the hair and bath varieties.  I've given the. hair towels to most of my female friends, both long and short haired ones, and they ALL think they are a superior product
B0016B20EG|5|honestly i was hesitated to order perfume online due to negative reviews on here. But then i thought, people are ugly in heart sometime and they will never be happy no matter what. and again i have honestly never smell this before but my mom love it. so i gave it a try and order this from these guy, wen i gave it to her, she said yep! thats the smell i love. i thought wow! I'm going to have to purchased from them again. may be buying perfume online isn't so hard after all.
B0059GFR62|1|i askd the cream for whitening but it gives pimples on mah face ...its of no useee ...feels like throwing it
B000MT1GHA|5|This has a lovely fresh scent, I use it after a bubble bath, it's not too heavy or 'perfumey' for bedtime. A nice clean refreshing fragrance. Love the little powder puff!
B0038TVHGG|1|I bought this product and the hair mask from Target and i almost cried after washing it out of my hair. I am transitioning and my hair tangles very little usually. This left my hair a dry, tangled, brillo pad MESS! I had to wash my hair over 3 times to get normal feeling back into it. I'm not sure where this went wrong. I use the Thickening Mist and the Dandruff Mist and I love them both. This shampoo and the Hair Masque are a definite NO! I will definitely be returning them back to target for a refund, and sticking to Herbal Essence Hydralicious.
B00NULMIYW|5|I always thought professional looking make up cost a fortune you had to be rich to afford the stuff the celebrities were using and all these different things they were endorsing.  Then when we were getting ready for my best friends bridal shower she pulled out this little air brush gizmo and sprayed her face and in under a min she looked amazing. I had to get the details and use since we wear the same shade. That was it I was hooked I went home and ordered it. I use it every day and don’t have to use nearly as much as I do with the stuff I was normally wearing.
B00DZPZ6IS|5|Love this powder.  Really covers!
B00CNTJHQO|1|Main problem is dermatitis. This did not help as some revierers stated. Have been most off the self and some proscriptions shampoos and nothing has helped. I may be the exception. As far as dandruff I don't have that problem.
B0062GZB9G|5|I didnt realize i ordered the very black color, but actually don;t mind how dark it really is now that i've worn it a few times.  it goes on nice and thick so i dont need a million layers to get the perfect touch of volume!! it spread evenly with no clumps either which was a relief.  i havent worn it in the water or through a shower yet, but i have left it on over night a few times and it stayed on enough to be noticeable, which was nice as i was rushing out the door late for class.  ;)  I have noticed that it does take a bit more work to completely get off, but i guess that means its claim of 24 hours is a solid one!
B007NNEK08|5|Since I found DevaCurl products, I have never ceased to be impressed with their products. I don't think I'll ever use anything else on my curls. The hairspray smells great, lavender, and only needs a short spray after I diffuse and use the UltraGel to keep my curls looking great all day.
B00NBAKXIA|4|Love it!
B000YJ2SLG|5|No scent, goes on easily, leaves skin soft & lasts all day.
B003M5UOBK|5|Works good and products stands well.
B000YL5W94|4|Recomiendo al vendedor del producto a tiempo en el envio, en la entrega, dando buenos resultados con la entrega en la comodidad el domicilio
B0058PCTH4|5|I have no complaints. Came well packaged, arrived quickly and I love it for all my makeup. Will order again in the future.
B005IDTVC2|5|You can not go wrong with Estee Lauder. No matter where you might start looking and trying..you will be back. Give it a try with the sample. You will be amazed! And, thanks to the seller, Mayflower. So easy to buy from and a very trusted seller! Ms. Audrey K.
B00KGYWTJ0|5|Yunnan Baiyao tooth paste is great. But the price is 222222 high.
B00CAW7SD8|5|Works great for me as I do not have total flex-ability.
B000FGDID0|5|This is wonderful toothpaste, it's so effective that I end up using about 1/4th as much as the other brands I have tried.
B00CUG2582|5|As users of many different toothbrushes over the years, including some of the latest sonicare models, this one is truly a step up. It's expensive, there's no getting around that. Over it's predecessors, it's a huge step up. The extended bristles make for much easier penetration in between teeth and give that &#34;dentist clean&#34; feeling after brushing. The charge seems to last 2-3 weeks so far in between charges. No problems with mold or funk around the base of the brush as in previous models. The various modes they've introduced are a nice touch, but we don't use them mush in all honesty. The features added that have been very helpful are the sensor that lets you know when your brushing too hard, and the little pulse that it gives out when you have spent enough time brushing one quadrant of your mouth. If I can say one thing that is the biggest improvement it's the rate at which this new design vibrates, allowing for a much better removal of plaque. The carrying case is great to have when on the go, and the new charging base is easy to keep clean. Although the price is on the very high end, it's a piece of technology that will last for years to come. If anyone has any questions leave a comment and I'll do my best to answer. We did a lot of research and will help pass on any info.
B00HQN6QV6|5|Good. Fresh colors.
B003CN78GG|5|Absolutely love this stuff~
B002G5ULWY|3|I always buy this product since the day it came out. At walgreens or Cvs. However, when the drug stores stopped selling this, I had to look online. I ordered the same shade I always got. It arrived on time and in good condition. After shaking product and applying on sponge, it didn't last long. It had a very water like base to it which in other store bought products didn't.
B005G42K8A|5|its a great gift
B0068T115K|4|Great price,  fresh and clean sweet citrus settling back into a comfortable top end musk. This is a light and airy masculine cologne which refreshed throughout the day and was noticed but not overwhelming.
B003V9N1RQ|5|Love it.
B000C1VSJE|5|best ever!!
B0067USBRQ|5|Awesome for a day outside. Works well even when sweating - long bike ride, day on the water
B0010AZ3TM|1|Does not work? Sorry to say I tried this product and it really is no good not sure why it's allowed to be sold?
B002NGMEVM|5|This flat iron is great! It heats up really fast and has a dial so you can choose your temp settings. The steam comes out auotmatically (with my old one, you had to press a button every time). It takes me a very short amount of time to straighten my hair and my hair feels really soft when I'm done even without any styling products.
B001ECQ4L2|5|Vaseline is one of the best petroleum jelly in the market. It is specially too good for cold weather. I got cheapest prices on Amazon for a pack of 3 units which is the best value in the net.<br /><br />I recommend this product to everyone.
B0009MYUI2|5|Sounds very weird, but actually got this because I am in the process of losing a lot of weight and building muscle, and every time I go through my slimming phase I develop stretch marks on my arms near my arm pits and under my biceps. I needed a product that would moisturize and firm throughout this to keep the skin from having stretch marks appear. So far so good, I've been applying it using the instructions on the bottle and I haven't seen any signs of stretch marks, which normally I see them right away.<br /><br />If you are a bodybuilder/weightlifter and experience stretch marks due to rapid weight loss or muscle growth, then this will work great for you!<br /><br />So, this stuff is fantastic even if you're not going through a pregnancy. Please note that I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and un-biased review, however, that has in no way affected my review here today and I would recommend this to my friends and family.
B008NUWEIU|5|My hubby and I swear by this conditioner! Not only does it extend color, but it makes hair healthier. Since it doesn't contain SLS and is enriched with aminos, I know we are nourishing both scalp and hair. The difference is noticeable.
B008HBMRRS|1|I purchased this with high expectations but I ended up disappointed. It smells great, but that is about all I can say positively about it. It went on very thick, almost difficult to smooth on face and neck. It also left my face feeling and looking oily all day. I couldn't wait to wash it off when I got home. It took two washes to remove it. I wouldn't recommend this product.
B0009ET4R2|5|Soothing and hydrating mask without animal testing. What's not to love
B004Y9GTYE|5|What a steal! This stuff works. I have tried expensive makeup from department stores and sephora, butInstant Age Rewind Eraser works better. Cursed with very dark circles under my eyes constantly, this is a miracle worker for me.
B005OZOIKY|4|In order to keep my hair healthier I only wash it every three days. This product helps to keep my hair looking great on days two and three of not washing it. I just spray it in, give my hair a quick brush or a little blow dry and I am ready to go! My hair looks completely rejuvenated. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it does add a bit of a strange texture to my hair which is why I have to blow dry it for a minute or so, which gets rid of it.
B00G0Q5V0M|2|The oil is fine but, ever since I opened the bottle there is always a film of oil on the outside of the bottle. Not sure if the oil is somehow siphoning out of the top or what but I will not buy it again, just too messy. Another place I purchase from had a different kind of top and I didn't have an issue so I think I will go back to that brand.
B005MR9BU6|1|I would love to rate this product....but I never got it...ordered Oct.24th today is November 28th sent several emails...no response
B000W3XB9M|5|love it
B00KNEDQ72|5|Since I started using Anastasia Beverly Hills Dipbrow Pomade everyone has been complementing and asking what product I use for my eye brows. It's very easy to create any shape, and it does last for the whole day. Ordered 2nd piece for my friend as I recommended it for her.
B00DU6DWVA|5|Took awhile to get here, but I was very happy with what I received
B0050HO9MI|4|Just what I was looking for
B003NCXXIS|3|It does a good job shaving, but the battery charge doesn't last long and it takes hours to recharge. I don't know if it is just mine or they are all this way.
B000C1W44M|5|Ladies I have been wearing Ciara for many many years, so I was skeptical when I saw the price on here. Is this a cheap knockoff or the real thing? Well let me tell you, this is definitely the &#34;real deal&#34;.  I was pleasantly surprised, because I honestly thought it would be a cheap knockoff.  No more over priced department store for me! I even ordered 2 more bottles for what I usually pay for one bottle in the department store.  I am a very happy customer.
B00P8P0KVQ|3|Everrything looks the same.
B001AT53NY|5|WOW . takes some time but it def works.Getting tons of compliments on my teeth, so other people are noticing.<br /><br />I started whitening my top only to see if I could tell a difference. At first it was very splochy and uneven, but the more I whitened them the nicer they looked. I bought this gel for 3 of my girl friends they all love it too.<br /><br />be careful it is VERY strong. I left it on and forgot (I wear my retainers at night regardless) my gums were bleeding and white the next day. That was my own fault.<br /><br />This product is amazing.
B00BIALWQW|5|Beautiful color, cures beautifully and no shrinkage.  I always receive compliments on this color. It is a true creamy teal color with great coverage in just two coats.  Gelish is the only polish I will ever wear.  2-3 weeks on fingers and I have gone about 7 weeks on my toes before changing colors due to new growth. Perfect for the busy mom who doesn't have time to polish her nails 4 times a week!
B00525ZYXQ|1|This purchase was to replace a similar CHI brand dryer that was an all time favorite. This model has a different ON/Off toggle style switch that is very sensitive. So much to the point that when you switch hands while styling the power is often shut off by accident. I have small hands and consider myself to have good coordinations, but after 6 months I can not seem to avoid inadvertantly shutting the power off.
B009UYDOUK|2|I bought the Tonymoly Appletox for use as a massage cream based on the good reviews here. But I was disappointed in it.<br /><br />As an older woman, all my skin products and cosmetics have got to work overtime on improving my skin in some way. The Appletox seemed to have some good ingredients in it to help exfoliate while you massage, like fruit acids and papaya enzymes. However, when I got it and used it, there doesn't seem to be much going for it at all - nothing beneficial.<br /><br />People remarked on the skin sloughing off - that is not actually your skin. When the cream gets warmed by your fingers or the temperature, the formula  starts balling up into these solid pieces that may seem like skin, or that is marketed as your skin sloughing off. You can try it yourself - rub some on a piece of plastic - the same solids will form - it is definitely not your skin. If any cream got that much skin off your face that quickly and without much rubbing at all - it would be the holy grail of skincare! The solid pieces do help mechanically rub your skin, just as microbeads or other mechanical styles of exfoliants work.<br /><br />The cream smells nice and is easy to massage on, and it rinses off nicely - leaving a moisturized feeling as opposed to a dry feeling. I am using it as a quick cleanser in the morning in the shower. But I won't buy it again. Not enough real results. Not good enough as an exfoliator. Not good enough as a massage cream. Just meh.
B0016GNT7S|5|I'm usually an OPI polish addict but lately I've been getting little bubbles in my top coat. I tried this as a new top coat and was pleasantly surprised! No bubbles, goes on quick and adds a great top gloss!
B001CT09OK|5|This is my favorite perfume for a long time. I love the smell so sweet and feminine. I'm happy with this purchase
B00756HQNQ|5|The best for callous removing. It's a little gross cause it feels like you're grating cheese lol but it works wonders. My feet soft after I use this. Highly recommended.
B009W28L6M|3|This product is a little on the greasy side. I do like that it does give your hair some shine. Just remember to only a small amout of the product at a time.
B0039UTTCI|5|this stuff is really good. i bought it as a cheaper alternative to mac msf deep. and it's really good.
B00874L8RK|1|I've watched plenty of beauty gurus rave about how wonderful this stuff is.. but it's really not!!<br />I found it was super hard to get to blend in, and it dried too quickly which is somewhat a plus but not when it dries before you can get it rubbed in!!<br /><br />and after i thought i had everything blended, 5 hours later i look like a cheetah with all the streaking i had plus i showered and shaved before i put it on!!<br /><br />not a good product AT ALL<br /><br />AND I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND !
B004292BBG|4|Works wonders to firm things on a temporary basis but, aldo dose nice over a long term.
B0002T7CF0|5|This product is great for girls who insist upon a dramatic eye.  When it comes to makeup price is no problem for me, I use this stuff like its water and own every color! (See my list of makeup)
B0091H9XI8|5|Love this lotion I use it on every night
B00016XJ4M|5|I love this product! It's refreshing and smells wonderful.
B007S69QAY|5|There rollers are great.  They heat up quickly and they curl my rather rough hair perfectly.  There is a tony bit of a learning curve on how to set your hair using the clips that come with it but otherwise, after a few times, I'm already getting really good at using these in the most effective way.  Great price, great quality, exactly what I wanted.<br /><br />The one  con that  someone might mention is that these are rather heavy and with a head full of rollers it can weigh a bit, but this does not bother me much.  I love these.
B0012WLMTI|5|I've used this product for a while and have fewer, less visable lines around my mouth and eyes.  I love this product and have thrown away all my other \\"drug store\\" skin care products.
B001MA0QY2|5|great flat iron! i have been using the chi for at least 10 years and it finally broke-i decided to try this product because it was a lot less expensive and had great reviews! will never pay $140 for a chi again. Would definately consider an hsi if youre looking for a great flat iron!
B004DK8TUQ|5|Just started week 6 with this hair color, and it's still pretty strong in color. I love this color, it's not overwhelming, it gives off a dark natural brownish red color which is just gorgeous. I'm ordering another box so I can re-do the color in a couple of weeks, only because the grey hairs are poking through.
B002VECKK6|5|I normally use a mineral concealer and foundation and for some reason, it really sits in all of my fine lines and makes me look older and this is not a good look!  The Covergirl and Olay corrector doesn't do that at all.
B003UH0528|5|It's just perfect for foundation..I'm in love with this brush I can get enough of it...:-)  I recommend for your collection..
B000G1EQ1W|2|Let me start with the fact that the auto-cleaning function is really neat. This shaver also hasn't harmed me in any way, nor has it ceased to function. So, for those reasons, I believe it fully merits both of the stars I've given it.    Now for why it can't get any more.    1. Shave quality. This shaver can't hold a candle to my dear and departed 12-year-old Norelco 5863XL. It takes many more passes to achieve a close shave, and even after that it leaves low stubble where the Norelco left me truly clean-shaven. And that's just on my face. On my neck it leaves the hair basically untouched when shaving up the neck, requiring me to perform manual acrobatics and hold the shaver sequentially in various positions to get any kind of shave at all. Overall, I'm now spending about 8 minutes where I used to spend about 4, and I'm getting a substantially worse shave.    2. Noise. The last 3 shavers I've owned are the aforementioned Norelco, a cheap Panasonic wet/dry, and a $5 Vidal Sassoon hair clipper. The Braun is easily louder than the clipper (I ran them both to check), and probably louder than the Norelco and the Panasonic running at the same time. It's insane. It's louder than my cordless drill. Just as bad, the cleaning function makes the same noise (it runs the shaver on and off), so I can't run it overnight. I don't even like to run it while I'm in the house. Too bad I have to be in the house while I'm using it.    Suffice it to say that at this price point, I am extremely disappointed with this product.
B00KCFAZTE|4|I'm just about finished with the first month, and I do detect a subtle improvement.  Can't wait to see what happens in the next few weeks.  Otherwise, I've been using the cream/gel on my entire face and it feels great.  So cool and hydrating without being heavy or greasy.  I'm anticipating very good results.
B004QM4UMC|5|like i said its pretty good its not quite as good as the one i use to use that was taken off the market but it runs close and i took every ones advice on mixing and i had no problem my old liner lasted for way over a year ill update this and let every one know how long it lasts
B0000XMQHW|5|this is the shiiiii%  works amazing
B00C662YMI|5|Great!  Very hard to find soft gray.
B0052GTZ7Q|5|Best skin lotion I've ever used. I've been using it for 2 years now only on my face. No more break out/pimples. My only complaint is that the price always increases each time I reorder the product.
B003156NFM|4|I have been using this product, the Neutrogena Clinical Facial Lifting Wrinkle Treatment SPF30 for about 3 weeks and I saw improvement in my skin texture immediately and improvements to wrinkles/facial lines as I've continued to use it.  Although it is true that this is less costly than many other high end products I still think it is quite pricey unless bought on Amazon (and any mail in rebates/discount coupons help alot).  Our local CVS sells this same item for $39.95.
B002Z13TL4|5|Excellent ítem, thanks
B00NV9KMBO|5|Nivea body in shower body lotion I love how it make your skin so soft and I like the smell too. I will buy more of it. I won't go back to what I was using. so if you like soft skin like I do you will love it too.
B004NKWC4A|5|I needed for work. It works well enough for my needs. I only need to carry a single folder, a wallet, a pair of sunglasses, a make-up bag, and a small umbrella. I carry my keys and pepper spray in the small inside pocket. I do not carry a purse to work. This bag is not very heavy. It does NOT zip close, it has no zip and I did not need it to do so.
B000EGIEYY|2|I don't know what all the rave to this product is about, but it smells so awful. I received it as pictured, but when I opened the bottle to use it, it smelled really bad; there's a fishy combined with trash smell. It's so bad that after the 3rd day I felt too weird using it so I can't comment on the effectiveness itself but it does absorb quickly and the packaging is nice which I give it a 2 star.
B000E7YJYC|5|Love this stuff
B009Y8SHWC|1|I purchased this item from another web site, but it's the same photos of the shade guide.  This is a knock-off of a VITA shade guide and the shades don't match.  If you're using this only as a guide to show patients the progress of their whitening, it will work fine, but if you're communicating with a dental lab, and referencing the tabs on this cheap immitation, you will get a crown back from the lab that doesn't match in the mouth.  BEWARE.
B006UETDR6|4|The shade looks natural when applied and blended correctly. The consistency could be a little smoother.
B008TVNUNG|5|Perfect
B006E196FO|5|I love the smell of Inis. It's such a fresh smell - really reminds you of the ocean. I like that it's also uni-sex and not too sweet smelling. It's a perfect summer scent. The Inis Or and Inis Moonlight give a lovely twist to an already wonderful scent.
B000OD5UQ2|5|This KAI  Body Lotion is the absolute best.  I was first introducted to it when a friend gave me some for a Christmas gift.  It was on Oprah once as one of her FAVORITES.  It smells like a wonderful JASMINE-type scent and lasts on your body for a nice long time.  It really is one of my all-time favorites and also use the KAI body sponge with liquid soap inside it.
B006UETDGC|2|I used to use Maybelline's dream mousse blush and loved it. So when that product was discontinued, I thought I'd give this stuff a try. You basically pay the same price for less product and cheaper packaging. Surprise surprise. And the consistency of it is just terrible... It reminds me of Play-Doh, you end up just moving it around the container. Yuck.
B00HG1JFXY|5|I have been using this with Ultrax Hair Surge and I have to say that I didn't realize my hair could be so thick! I'm growing my hair out and the back part seemed to take forever to look like I had hair back there.  After using this for a week or so, I could already tell that my hair was growing so much fuller (and quicker) than it used to!
B000FTIY54|5|This soap is worth the price!  Each bar is 1/2 LB of silky smooth lather that  lasts!  When I used it I was amazed by how long the lather lasts on my washcloth.  Plus the bar itself is HUGE!  At least 2x bigger than any bar of soap I've ever bought.  And I have LAVA soap in the house....this soap is still bigger. It barely fits in my soap dish.   <br /> <br />I've been using Yardley's English soap, and I have to constantly re-lather my washcloth to get anything done.  Using this [Kiss my Face] after a hot day at work and I felt refreshed and very confident in it's moisturizing ability.  It also only has 5 ingredients, all natural.  I plan on buying more in the other fragrances, to have some variety.  Very glad that I took the chance.
B005XSZS60|3|great product
B002QIADS8|3|It's good, also for the price! I like it ! :)
B002Z7FSJ4|1|Way too expensive for a product that simply doesn't work for me.
B000AUIFCA|5|Fits all of our older model tooth brushes.
B004WPGXSW|4|I have used this little kit every day. I have black hair and very light skin and I use the darkest of the colours to fill in my overly plucked brows, and it fills them in perfectly without looking like I used a crayon I found in prison (we all know that look). I can see this kit would be good for all hair colours...and it is super easy to use. The price is right. I'll purchase it again.
B0097G4QY4|4|This product has diminished the dark circles under my eyes and they appear brighter.  It doesn't do much for the wrinkles so I a using another product for that at night.
B004KKQKGO|5|This is the greatest invention for cosmetics ever. Just wish I knew about it sooner. This case condenses every piece of impact cosmetic you have. I am a national traveler and this could not be anymore convenient for me than these Z palettes.  Plan on buying a couple more to further condense everything. And love the patter and colors they come in. A BIG Thank You for the fast shipping too. Just in time for my next trip.
B000WIIMYQ|5|I like this lipstick. It does really stay on a long time.
B0007OCL4M|4|for the price this product worked very well...if you want to always use it you may want to spend a little more money on one....but for the price this product works very well...
B0041MJMGQ|5|These are excellent tweezers. Of course, they are not inexpensive but the quality is definitely there. The tweezers grip perfectly and are precisely ground down to a perfectly smooth finish so when you rub them along your skin there are no rough spots on the tweezers themselves. I lost my most favorite pair of tweezers and have searched high and low for a replacement pair. Leave it to the Germans to make a superior product! I am very impressed with this Solingen product and will definitely consider purchasing again if needed.
B004FQGLQC|5|I have fine hair and an oily scalp, so I've tried every dry shampoo on the market. It doesn't matter how much money you spend, they ALL seem to run out quicker than you expect and leave a white powdery residue (unless you get the one's made specifically for brunettes). I really like this one because not only does it work great, it smells good, it's cheap, and it lasts all day long. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on the expensive brands as you're not getting any real value for the extra cost.
B00SSG1AZ2|5|Big pads thick good flavor
B000UWAWQU|1|The unit initially worked quite well; a great adjunct to the oral hygiene routine. I used a peroxide based mouth wash with water and had good result.  Yes, the reservoir is small but it's so easy to refill that I don't find that to be an issue.<br /><br />Within about a week of using the device, the power started to fall off quickly between charges.  I get one or two uses on high and then the high setting became like the low.  Eight weeks in the device wouldn't hold a charge -- and the entire assembly where the reservoir meets the main unit was moldy.  Maybe I missed something in the instructions, something about having to take the reservoir off each time and let the unit dry out?  I don't know because I didn't see any instructions that said anything about that. It would be been a pain but I would have done it.<br /><br />I didn't contact Waterpik because frankly my time is worth more than sitting on the phone or packing the thing up and sending it back.  It went into the trash.
B005HO0AR2|4|Had to get use to the smell after using scented bars, it has a very strong bland smell. After getting over the smell it's like heaven, it feels more moisturizing than the scented versions, and it doesn't dry my skin out afterwards. But I don't use it on my face, it dries that out.
B004E5PJE4|5|clipped in easily to my hair. got dark brown and it was a perfect color match. very silky and high quality hair. good price as well
B004ITBD82|1|I agree with the other 1 Star user. I am 46 and have very good skin. This product caused me to have purple swollen bags under and above my eyes with new dryness and wrinkles. I thought I started aging at an accelerated rate from stress. As soon as I stopped using it, the bags have now significantly decreased - and I purchased a new product that works great - glo-therapeutics eye restore. I have never written a review on Amazon but I really needed to let people know this is not a good eye cream for those with sensitive skin. It would be better to use a store bought cream without these ingredients.
B003TXO7XQ|2|WASTE of money.  Not only was this mascara clumpy, but the tiny brush makes it take forever to do my makeup.  If the brush tip had been thin instead of bulbous, at least it would be great to use in corners to get those difficult to reach lashes...however, who wants that many different mascaras lying around already crowded makeup drawers?  I actually threw this away after a few attempts to use it.  I do not recommend this product.
B005OYDID8|5|Have used a Remington for years, The Wahl has more power and lighter and easy to use.  Would recommend to anyone.
B00473MDPQ|5|Packaged arrived with the nicest surprise of a personal handwritten note. It's things like this that shows great customer service. Will definitely order again!
B004Y0FKNE|2|The color, Blonde, was much too dark for my hair. I will not use the product. The company needs to make a lighter color.
B00S096N6S|5|I love all of the Hempz products. This especially smells wonderful
B00FUV25UW|5|Everything I expect and more. I couldn't be happier with your service.
B005JV9A6U|5|I'm getting compliments ! Great value.
B00LNOV8JO|5|My wife loves it.  I'm going to make hand cream with it but haven't done it yet.
B0054LHI5A|5|Girlfriend is obsessed with these, I like them too.
B0083Z05PY|5|This is just the gun, no electric device or anything like that. The gun works flawlessly and its much quieter than the other ones that he has
B00T4JQNLI|5|I generally prefer baby/kid sunscreen on my adult face as it's gentler and have been very happy I tried Babo's Daily Sheer! No scent or heavy texture and my favorite, no balling through the day! I'm looking forward to having this in my bag for summer.
B0014P8L9W|5|I use this product about once a week. It doesn't take long to make, I mix mine with just warm water.I leave it on until it completely dries and then I take a shower to remove it. After my shower I use a moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and red or peeling skin is something I often have to think about. I haven't had any of those issues with this product at all.  I would recommend this product for anyone to try out. I plan to buy more from amazon when I finish this product.
B000I5DTGO|5|Bought this as part of a doctor kit for my son's birthday. My son has a minor orthopedic problem which requires a lot of doctor visits. I couldn't just buy him a &#34;toy&#34; doctor kit, he had to have the real deal. This BP cuff was medical grade, looks just like any cuff that you'd see at a doctors office. This was a huge hit in the toy kit as pumping up the cuff is always something he is trying to do.<br /><br />This also functions well as a real BP cuff and not just a toy :)
B00AU9VX3Y|5|Thought these were gonna come in plastic bowls byt they didn't.  Overall I am very pleased with this product. Arrived quick also.
B003H6FPVI|4|This epilator does what it is supposed to do, it pulls out the hair and leaves it smooth for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />cons: more ingrown hairs, leaves red bumps afterwards, HURTS the first couple of times<br /><br />But everyone has different skin so it might work better for someone else
B00CHJ34P0|4|This colorful sleeve worked great for my Macbook. Not for protection if dropped but keeps dust away and looks nice sitting out!
B0031RDT3E|3|Applying primer first, otherwise it will be a mess when you're sweaty!
B002L18V7U|5|I have reviewd this before and it is the best on the market.
B00APPLSVA|5|Love it
B0041SO88C|5|I buy this for my mom all the time, but I usually only can find single bottles.  Thank you for selling this in a six pack!
B0002RSW2E|5|I love this shampoo.  It works perfectly for my hair, not too heavy and really gets it clean.  The seller shipped it quickly and in good shape.
B00J86HFB4|3|They work but i would have liked the roughr ones for my bf, together we went thru one on one use. Pretty sure it was my bad thou
B00KHYHE44|5|Very cute and is on a nice long chain also. I wish it had different links to make the necklace shorter or longer depending on what shirt I'm wearing but other than that it is a great quality for the price!
B002AH5RS6|5|love this oil
B0007CXX82|5|I have used this product for years and love the way my hair looks and feels.  It does not flake and does not leave my hair super hard. It will also moisturizes my scalp.  Amazon sells this product cheaper than any where I have looked.
B006Z0ZV4Y|1|Hair was co washed before putting in black dye came out the hair. Braided the hair in a ponytail to go swimming when I came out the water to undo the hair to wash it it matted and tangled in a knot could not get it out. A hot mess
B003MGI89Y|5|This is the best moisturizer I've ever tried for less than $30.  It absorbs into my facial skin quickly, is very effective all day long and leaves no perceptible residue. You can use it in the morning before applying make-up and not have to wait more than 5 -10 minutes.  I love it!  But I noticed it disappeared from stores and so I went to the Biore website this week to find out it's been discontinued!  So I immediately went to Amazon and ordered 2.  Is this a conspiracy?!  Every time I find a great product for a reasonable price, it disappears.  Hopefully this is a temporary situation and Biore will see the light and bring their moisturizers back to the US market.  I'm not sure if Biore is a Japanese company but I know I saw their products all over Japan in the 80's before I ever saw them in the US. Their brand strength has always been their pore minimizers but they do so much more than that.  They need to promote themselves better as a total facial care line.  By the way, I keep mine in the refrigerator which makes applying it during a hot summer in Texas feel wonderful.
B0086I34UG|5|I have been using Fysiko for about a month now and have definitely noticed a difference! My eyelashes are longer! The package says it takes 4 months of continuous use to see the end results; I can't wait to see how long my eyelashes will be by then! Love it!
B001AO0WDA|5|I have think hair and wavy and frizzy so this product really works so great to me love it
B004DP7DPI|5|Works well to cover my under-eye circles and redness. I lightly dust it with a mineral foundation after application which helps to blend the color- otherwise it looks pretty yellow. One container has lasted more than 6 months- will probably take a year of daily use to go through the entire thing. Neutral smell (similar to beeswax)
B004UQPCNA|1|Product was dried up in jar....
B000052YBV|4|This is a good quick fix. Doesn't last as long as the relining kits but still does a good job and fairly easy to use with no bad taste or smell.
B005IVZ4MU|5|This stuff smells amazing and is quite moisturizing.  I have a hard time finding this except during the Christmas holidays so I stocked up so I could use it year-round.
B0085OD72G|5|This duo is a great size combo for a great price. The lids shut tightly to stop any leaks if they get tipped over.
B00BEFM64I|5|I love it, just not the price in the stores I paid less online I had to pay out the @$$. is this how it going to be with your products, you're going to have some people go to another brand :( some of us love this product
B005YB42A4|5|My daughter was so happy to get this for Christmas!  She wears it every day!  Amazon comes through again for me!
B0015A807Y|3|I come from a &#34;hair&#34; family - my sister is a Redken Elite salon owner, and many other family members are in the industry as well so I have grown up using a variety of high-end hair products.  Since my family is in another city, I ran out of shampoo and conditioner and decided to give Joico a try.  Overall, the size and price makes it worth the purchase, but there are many superior products out there that don't cost much more.<br /><br />My first impression was not good because the pump on the conditioner was broken when I received my package.  The pump that I have on the shampoo definitely works, but 1 pump barely distributes any product, so I have to pump about 8-10 times to get enough shampoo.<br /><br />I ordered this combo because another review stated that while it is a moisturizing shampoo/conditioner, it doesn't leave your hair flat.  I appreciated that it did not leave my hair flat, but it also didn't moisturize hardly at all.  After using this shampoo for about 2-3 months, I forgot it was even named as a moisturizing shampoo until sitting down to write this review.<br /><br />Finally, the product smells good and cleanses hair pretty well, so other than the broken pump and non-moisturizing, it's a pretty good deal for the price.  I will probably not buy again, but it has lasted for a really long time and I'm not disappointed in the purchase.
B000W3QDJ2|5|Works well and as promised.
B0011MT99E|5|Smells amazing and very moisturizing. Absolutely love this stuff!
B00A6H2DD4|5|Don't live your life without one of these. The long flat loop side is pretty useless in my experience, but the other side of the tool works incredibly well.
B0027VCNGO|5|this is the best topcoat in the world. If you have never heard of this, you need to try it ASAP. it's magic. this is what nail salons use to make your nails perfect and last a long time and dry quickly. it's amazing!
B001KREZAS|5|Love this brush. I did not buy it to use with Avon's gel liner but to use it with a cake eyeliner that requires me to dip a brush in water/mixing medium and apply. It did the job well and the slant feature makes things alot easier.
B001OOLLVS|5|Adhere nicely to teeth and results are instant. Great product to produce your best smile.
B004NRLKOG|5|I love this glycerin and rose water. I use it as agent.e make up remover  and travels with me everywhere.
B002KAB9XU|5|This night cream works like no other night cream I have used. If you are looking for the best age defying night cream on the market try this one. The buy one get one free offer make this a great buy.
B007C2J9DS|1|I've used hot rollers off and on for over 20 years, so I'm no first-timer here. I bought this set to start rolling my hair again after letting it grow longer. At first, I loved the rollers! The flocking made it easier to roll my hair onto the hot rollers. The ends of the rollers were cool enough to handle and the rollers themselves seemed very warm, nearly hot. Once rolled, the rollers felt very hot on the top of my head, but only the top, where my hair is coincidentally the longest, nearly 6 inches. After letting them all completely cool, I removed them and had super springy curls all over my head. BUT....about 5 minutes later, spots on the top of my head felt like they were ON FIRE! Four hours later, there are still two areas left where it feels as badly burned as with a curling iron. WHAT THE HECK? It doesn't seem like the ends of the rollers were hot enough to curl the hair, let alone burn my scalp. I'm guessing it was the heat from the core of the rollers, even though they didn't feel excessively hot on my head. Whatever it was....I've NEVER experienced this before, even after so many years of using many different types of hot rollers. This set is already boxed right back up and going to be returned tomorrow. Anyone have a fire extinguisher??
B000C21424|5|Wow... The reviews for this perfume were right on the money. The perfume smells so nice and lasts all day. I've gotten compliments about this perfume even at the end of work.
B004VS56VK|5|One of my favorite smells ever!
B00147X6DQ|5|I was so happy to find this product at a reasonable price.  I will definitely order it again and highly recommend it.
B003NU7I6S|5|I have tried so many different lotions, but this is the first one that worked for me. It was on the recomendation of a dermatologist and he was right.  On my hands its great and my legs no longer itch like crazy.  Its good on my feet as well.  I bought these 2 tubes so that I could keep one in my purse, and one in my desk drawer and I bought a big tub of it for the bathroom after a shower.<br />This really works great, I can finally stop buying stuff that doesn't work.
B003A1DWRO|4|The only thing I was not happy with is that the low setting is too strong for drying with the defuser.
B000AMBF5W|5|This is the best cream....I have used very expensive creams in the past, and I happen to have forgotten my moisturizer on a recent trip. I picked some of this up and I cannot tell you how impressed I was with this. <br />Couldn't find it in my home town, so turned to Amazon and found it. I am thrilled with it and recommend it to all.
B00HMDX1IQ|2|Only one came.  Great product but needed them for Christmas stocking stuffers and being shorted wasn't good!!!
B003RZPCU8|5|my husband loves this shampoo. he says it has a tingle on his scalp, and he sees results. the big bottle last forever, for him it lasted 7 mos.
B002T3SL7A|5|This product is expensive but worth every penny!  It makes your skin look healthy and glowing without making it shiny. If you don't need a lot of coverage you can use in place of liquid foundation. One of the best products I have ever used. I absolutely love it!
B00CQKWTP6|5|I bought this oil to add a nice scent to my oil cleansing blend. I use my blend to wash my face and neck. The lavender smell afterwards is so relaxing. A little goes a long way! I would recommend this oil to people with anxiety and/or trouble getting to sleep at night.
B000052WYL|3|effective sometimes
B0001YXXUY|1|This item worked for me for maybe 10 times, then shut off.  I could not get it to work.  It turned on, I think when it cooled off, just once.  It smelled an electrical burning, then died.  The product should work for tons of times....  It should not have broken.  I want a new one!!! to replace this lemon one.
B008L0AIUS|5|Cirepil Blue Wax is the ONLY wax I use on my clients with sensitive skin. Less discomfort, less redness and is high quality. I have been an Esthetician for 12 years and I use this wax for Facial and Body waxing. My clients REQUEST it because they love it so much! I will never stray from using Cirepil Hard waxes!
B009TCUCT4|4|One of favorite.....
B001BAN0FK|4|Product arrived when expected and in good shape.   No problems with the seller.     For the purpose I'm using the styrofoam head (to make a mold for a Halloween decoration), I would have preferred it to be a little more realistic in appearance. But it was a good deal for the price, and I can \\"tweak\\" it a bit with a little craft clay and an exacto blade.       All in all, a good shopping experience with this seller.
B001E0VBDK|5|I LOVE this soap. It was recommended by my Doctor and it is everything I expected.<br />Leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth, not tight and the scent is great.<br />Most importantly, it does not make me break out in mini rashes like other soaps do.
B004OK8QYY|1|I bought this soap thinking it would actually work but it doesnt it just makes yours boobs dry and itchy its a waste of moeny no miracle happened.
B002WBGBZS|5|I have tried the all - Furterer, Blandi, Suave, Tres Semme and paid a lot of money. None works better than Batiste. Other products seem to require you to use a lot of product to get the same result as a little bit of Batiste. I also found with other products that as the day progressed the fresh feel started to fade and my hair would start to get oily again.With Batiste it lasts all day with the same result. I even went out to the pool in the hot Florida sun and it held up perfectly! I can't recommend this enough.
B00112FL96|5|love this product
B0062CTOY8|5|Arrived fast and in excellent condition.  I put a few drops in my shampoo to promote hair growth.  I also put a few drops in my leave in conditioner.  Smells wonderful, and organic is the only way to go!
B003OZUTEU|5|Kerastase hair product it's amazing... It make my hair very soft and with a good shine look. I have a drye hair, but with the shampoo and conditioning of kerastase everything change. I love it! Thx!
B007TO50SM|5|Goood
B002QI8JFW|3|Too messy and hard to work with. Its ok once it dries.
B00I32AN4K|4|I do want this to be a wonderful hair mask but unfortunately I have not tried it yet.
B002M31MIW|2|I love almost everything Kerastase so I was very disappointed in this product.  It does nothing for my wavy, fine hair in terms of conditioning or anti-frizz.  I would suggest another product in their line instead of this one.
B0037MMJN4|3|So i kept hearing a lot of hype on this blush and every time i went to the pharmacy to pick it up it was always sold out so of coarse i ordered it from here. The package arrived on time and in one piece. The sender deff did his job, now the blush is ok, looks pretty yes and all but isn't as good as high end blushes. Glad i got it tho
B001765QGO|5|I HAVE BOUGHT PRODUCTS FROM THEM MANY TIMES, AND THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY GOOD. THEY DELIVER EVEN BEFORE THE DATE AND THEY ALWAYS SEND FREE SAMPLES.  I LOVE IT!!
B000S6QGIQ|2|Makes my hair straight. I bought it to help hold style. It would be great for someone wearing a straight style. It smells great and leaves hair shiny, but takes all body and curl out.
B00GSKNZZ8|5|Absolutely LOVE! It was good pricing as well. Great delivery time
B000VXV6Z4|4|I like this because it is the only peeling gel I can find anywhere that is just that (a peeling gel) and not a scrub or something you wash your face with. It's the only product I can find where you can actually see your face peel. The price is less than half of what you would pay for it anywhere else so it's a great deal.[[ASIN:B000VXV6Z4 Obey Your Body Dead Sea Facial Peeling Gel]]
B0000533FV|4|The price is a little high but I really like the product, Gina
B000NW9YTS|1|I use all Avalon Organics, but this one the smell is over powering.  Sorry.
B0019LV2QU|5|Product arrived within a few days and looked as pictured in perfect condition. Oil priced very well and plan to buy more in the future.
B00538TSMU|1|Horrible will never order again plastic waste of money 👎🏼 I didn't want to give it any stars but the way amonzon has this set up u have to pick a star in order to writ a review that sucks.
B000M0G80O|5|I love this product. I have only been using it a week but I have gotton a lot compliments in the last couple of days. I use it at night and after I wash my face in the morning(because it has a light tint) and where it like a powder foundation. I've already noticed that my skin tone, which was very uneven, has really improved. The only negative thing I can say about this product is that it is hard to figure out at first.
B008PEMOV6|5|This toothbrush saved my teeth.  Been using it for at least five years and my old one just quit on me.<br />Had pretty bad periodontal issues and now have none.
B00T2JM3VE|5|Excelent
B0011DKKGY|1|I can't say if it works or not, but I can say I no longer trust this seller. I got bacterial pink eye IN BOTH EYES the next day after using this the night before. Coincidence? I think not.
B00150LT40|5|Quick dry!
B003XXIMPG|5|Good item. Wish it did have a dropper. A tiny bit goes a long way. I live in socal, good to keep my hair hydrated and shiny. Doesnt weigh it down (i dont put it on my crown) just mid shaft and lower
B000C1Z5GQ|4|Terrific
B001E765FM|5|It's nice not to layer the chemicals under my arms every morning.  This only works if you're just out of the shower, and it doesn't include an antiperspirant, but natural is the way to go.  After trying 5 or 6 other crystal deodorants this is my favorite.  My teenager uses it too.
B007RKBEZ6|5|I'm usually not a big fan of gold, but this set somehow works really great. The first shade is a peachy pink with silver shimmer, the second one is more like a clear base with tons of gold shimmer, and bigger silver glitter, and the third one is also clear with big gold glitter. While I'm not a fan of the clear base and glitter combination most of the time, it looks pretty good with this one.<br />Application is easy, last on me for about 4-5 days, no chipping, just minor wear at the tips, and thanks to the clear base, the two glitter shades are awesome for layering over other colors.
B002WQ1AKE|4|Using these every day between great toe and 2nd toe for bunion relief. It has helped with positioning the toes and has reduced bunion pain and deformity. Praying it will prevent surgery in the future. I am able to wear more shoes without pain now than I could before using these spacers.
B00BMRZZ8M|5|Oh yea! This is it. I have many brands of perfumes - I keep this one on the front burner. It has a great aroma and lasts for up to seven hours. I have bought it twice (the Eau De Perfume to be precise). To ensure you buy the genuine thing, buy from Amazon. (Some vendors on Amazon.com sell counterfeit perfumes.) It is a lot more expensive at brick-and-mortar stores.
B0042MD7E8|5|I have very thick curly hair that is quite difficult to straighten, this blow dryer makes it seem like a walk in the park. I have never been so happy to spend 170 on anything before in my life!
B000C1ZB3I|5|I chose this rating because I love the perfume, it was at a good price and so easy to have it sent to my home..I would recommend it to anyone who loves the scent..
B00PS8M6W4|2|I doesn't work I thing its no good I&#34;ll tried to contact the seller but no answer
B000NWGCZ2|5|This was recommended by my dermatologist.  I have very dry sensitive skin and I have used a lot of other products out there.  The Vanicream Moisturizing Skin Cream is the best.  It goes on fairly easy and best of all it protects through out the day.
B001FDKGIW|5|So far so good...will update if anything changes.  I have used peanut trimmers for years, and this set is only to add another to our repertoire at home...the other ones I own have lasted years and years. It's a little noisy but is very gentle on tender skin and gets quite close at the same time.
B000H0ESTM|5|Good, smooth and clear soap.  I'm old, so I couldn't smell<br />the mint, but it's as good or better than my other soaps.<br />I did go for a walk after showing and cleaned house, did<br />my laundry and raked the yard!  Hmmmm, I wonder?
B0009OAHO6|5|A light scent, get a lot of compliments, have worn for years.
B005P0I1T2|4|Received product on time without any problems. I think the product has helped my hair, only gave 4 stars because I am using a couple of other products at the same time, but can't say anything bad about Goldilocks. It also has a nice odor, not as strong as some others.
B001AO0WCG|5|I've been using Moroccanoil for about a month now and I am in love with it! I have fine blonde hair and I was concerned that it would weigh my hair down or make it greasy but I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I recently moved to DC from California and my hair is not equipped to deal with humidity at all. Mair hair is usually so ruined after being outdoors for 5 minutes it looks like I didn't even shower and I have to pull it up immediately. Since I've been using Moroccanoil my hair looks fantastic - no frizz or flyaways. It makes your hair really shiny and smooth. The best part is that it lasts forever because I only use one small dab on wet hair. It doesn't do anything for volume but I'm sure you can use with a volumizing product and it wouldn't make your hair yucky. This is a great buy!
B001MA0QY2|3|I really don't understand why someone would have ever paid $100 plus dollars for this product. I purchased it on sale and still think I paid too much.
B003XQ7A38|4|I am very pleased with this product. For a \\"natural\\" cleanser it performs very well. I have always had trouble finding effective natural products, and I think it's because I was using the wrong type for my skin. This one really does work well.<br />I have mild adult acne and I can control it with this and some other products (like salicylic acid and benzyl peroxide and a weekly scrub). It definitely keeps the dead skin off without any irritation. After trying it I stopped to see if it was making a difference and after one weekend I started breaking out, so it works very quickly and well.<br /><br />As for the fragrance, it is stronger than other natural products. I would have to think if you are sensitive to fragrances this is going to be really annoying. I don't mind it so much, it kinda has a nostalgic grandma scent. Like cheap rose fragrance, but for me totally tolerable.<br />It does not remove make up well, I use something cheaper for that (Cetaphil for Oily skin).<br />I would recommend this product.
B00H5GQCP4|3|Not easy to open and close.
B0086VIA3O|4|I use these to brush my teeth.<br />They make my teeth clean.<br />I like the toothbrush they are attached to.<br />They are about $15 more than I would like to pay for a pack of 3<br />That is all.
B0013N88Z2|5|I have used this product for at least 4 years and it's fabulous. Have tried other long-stay lipsticks and they are either too drying or they don't stay as long as they advertise or the colors are too 'frosted'. This is a perfect color (Cinnamon)plus most of the other colors are great and the wearability is terrific. I put it on in the morning and never touch it again till I take it off at night - I do put the moisturizing balm on it several times a day.  The new 24-hour Maybelline lipstick is good for wearability but the colors are not good.
B0043OYFKU|5|Where have you been all my life!?  I adore this product because it works so well and feels so awesome on my face and neck.  It really works to clean your face and I will use it always.  Worth the buy and a must have for any woman.
B007YUIMRM|5|Fantastic and gentle
B001KA2R8M|2|I choose this rating because I really didn't like it<br />I dislike its hard to put it in ur eyes.. U have to go over n over<br />No one
B001DMF6C6|5|how can you make a bad loofa? this sucker keeps all my cracks and crevasses squeaky clean!
B00OYVZ6UA|5|This is excellent. My hair is softer then ever before. Absolutely love it. Price is very high though.
B001ECQ4Z8|3|Can someone please explain to me WHY is this cream $99.00?  HUH?  WTF?  Its cream...I used to use it and now cant find it in the drugstore just to see it on here for $99.00? For freaking real?  WHY?
B003YCCLIA|5|This stuff is great for clearing up your skin and giving you a nice healthy glow. You don't need to use it every day as advertised. I actually found my face wreaking havoc when I tried to. To me, it's a nice product that should be used in moderation when you see fit.
B00P8XOOWO|5|would totally buy this again !!
B00342ASVC|4|I have been using the product for past 1 year. It is really good. I don't have any acne in my face now and I make sure to use it once a day.<br />The price of the product has gone too up as I used to purchase it at 10 or 11$ from amazon.
B0015Z5BU8|5|excellent!! that's it!!
B0000ZHOH2|5|So this cream has helped my skin a lot. I have used it for a bought a month now and I see a difference with the amount of oil my skin produces. The oil production is way down and so are my breakouts. I get much less scaling and I don't feel like I constantly need to wash my face. I will be using this product for a long long time. I have tried everything and so far this has given me my best results. I apply 2x a day. No smell, no residue, no weird feeling on the skin after.
B000BO8OXU|3|I use a variety of creams and soaps to shave. This stick is convenient for face-lathering but that's about all. The scent is mild and the lather quality is average compared to other brands and types. In fact, this has been sitting in my medicine cabinet for quite a few months unused.
B00D9NV2D4|5|Very nice product. I used this to make an all natural deodorant and it worked perfectly!
B008XXR2AW|3|when you tilt them on the sides they are not all filled the same some. you don't get all the same amount
B0015TEFZG|5|my toe feels better!
B005IEKD8W|5|Halo Mist makes my silver hair sparkle!
B00NY64JJU|5|Love it!
B004VAP92E|5|I love John Varvatos scents.  It is an amazing item and deal.  I recommend this item to anyone.  It will not steer you wrong!
B00I60FXU8|4|I am sure that this product is very good for anyone who is determined to find solutions for their health with natural products. Myself I find it very beneficial and I use it additionally to all my other Mercola products and LifeSuperfood and some other very good products.<br />It goes without saying that it is stupid to smoke and or eat microwaved food, and that junk food should be avoided. Anyone who is conscious that they have to take responsibility themselves for their health (physical, mental, emotional and spiritual) is only too glad to find products like the &#34;Rejuvenating Phytoceramides&#34; and any other one with strictly natural, speak non GMO or GE, possibly glutenfree product. On the long run it is the only way to stay healhy.<br /><br />More and more people are waking up to the tremendous importance of taking the natural route, eating organic and stay healthy spiritually.<br /><br />My experience with this product, even though it's only been 3 weeks since taking it, regularly once day, is positive. My skin appears more hydrated and looks healthy. And I am. My age is 62.
B00E68O4JU|4|This product was super exciting to me. I got it on a Christmas sell and I'm glad I did. The curls weren't as smooth and I hoped for but I'm pretty sure that was my own fault. It worked just as it claimed and was very easy to use. I did manage to get my hair &#34;stuck&#34; once but it was because of my own misuse and after a very light pull it cut off and I got my hair out with ease. I have long thick hair down to the top of my butt.
B00AR03HRG|5|I purchased this for my young niece who has a tender head and hair that tangles easily.  A friend at work recommended this brush.  He uses it on his daughter who has very thick curly hair.  Another friend who is African-American said this is the only brush she uses on her daughter.  Please know I only point this out in order to show that it works on all hair types, thick, thin, curly, etc.  My niece would refuse to brush her hair because it hurt so much.  Now she asks to brush her hair like a princess.
B00J2ZLSBY|5|Tried this product before really helps ease the pain in my legs and lower back. Very, Very disappointed that about half of a bottle had liked into the plastic bag and out into the card board box.
B00NFCRBHK|3|The type of dress it was the bagging was wrong and dirt on the sleeve
B00AJ2LQDY|5|I love the sexy hair products and this was no exception.  It smells amazing and keeps my hair soft.
B003QJ6QZ0|5|This moisturizer, while a little on the heavier side for summer, works great the rest of the year with my skin. I never feel like it is goopy or oily, and I appreciate that they use the best of the best for ingredients. Highly recommend.
B005S28L9C|5|amazing item i am very pleased with my purchase!
B000F5DRC8|5|Great curling iron. The barrel is the perfect size: not too small and not too big.
B00J4VZCNQ|5|Helps severely dry peeling fingers!!
B00QJRKHOW|5|Fits good and wears well. Exactly what I was looking for.
B003YJAZZ4|5|I was already a Norelco user and was not happy with electric shaver compared to the Gillete Razors. The Razor gives awesome shave and with no much time. I needed a good shaver which would give me closest shave without much hassle.<br /><br />I tried the following 4:-<br /><br />1. Braun 550 cc-4<br />2. Braun 760 cc-1<br />3. Brain 760 cc-4<br />4. BRaun 790 cc-4<br /><br />There is a diffrence between cc-1 and cc-4 which was very difficult to judge or search online. Though from shaving point of view not much of a difference but Optifoil is better than Smartfoil. CC-1 is older model with Smartfoils and no Optifoil.<br /><br />All the products were awesome, 760 cc-4 and 790 cc-4 are exactly same except the LCD indicator and the Hygiene LCD indicator which I think was necessary for the difference I got. The washing system in 790 has quick wash option.<br /><br />The cc-1 are still more expensive. I dont know the reason. Perhaps the bigger pack size is the reason and it come with a plastic case instead of pouch. Pouch is much more better.<br /><br />The washing system in 790 is awesome . Infact you dont require a major wash if you wash it under quickwash daily.<br /><br />The overall Braun 790 cc is the best shaver in terms of treat to skin and closest shave. In one week you will be a fan of this product. I have seen Panasonics Arc 4 reviews and was sold for it. But when I tried 5 Series I realised Braun has class. I will agree that panasonic will also be good, but I doubt panasonic's clening system. Is it just there to give competetion to Braun or really a great, simple system, I doubt. Again for $180 getting a german machine is an edge. I would suggest guys, just go out and get a 5/7 series from nearest store and  Try it for 1 or 2 weeks and see the difference yourself....
B00KE5QC44|5|pretty colors, spring was a little bent on one; I had to straighten it gently myself. These are hard to find, so I am happy.
B00FULYKG4|5|This product is awesome!  I was able to reach all the contours of my back with ease.  The shave is very close, which was one of my concerns.  I also use this product on my legs, arms and chest.  I used to use a beard trimmer before, but with the Mangroomer Pro I shaved off 10 - 15 mins of grooming time (pun intended).  I still use the beard trimmer on my armpits and genitals.<br /><br />Construction is of high quality so I definitely recommend to any guy wanting to groom their body.
B0046ZOWJU|5|This iron is Very user friendly, ordered the 1 inch and it is perfect for tight or tousled hair whatever the length
B004HI5G82|3|I rate this product with three stars, so-so-satisfaction of product.  I am familiar with the twist container from like-kind products.  This particular item required twisting to the point of frustration: I thought it must be empty or broken.  At first some dry, crusted product came from the brush area..Yes, more twisting.  Finally some watery product started to to extract, it took considerably more twisting to get to the actual product.  It is important to note that the brush was clean when I began the twisting process.  Had I not paid attention to that, I would have assumed this was a used product that sat on a shelf somewhere for quite some time.  When the actual product finally extracted I applied it and was happy with the coverage result.  That is why I'm rating with three stars, the difficulty in getting to the actual product detracts from a higher rating.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B002VGXVY8|5|This lavender is awesome. I purchased this winter of 2011 and it still smells great a year later! Definitely worth the purchase!
B000GHYWTM|5|wowww sexy heady fragrance the perfect blend of floral and a hint of creamy musk its exotic to me the product arrived quick and it was the original perfume veryyyyy pleased
B001A42R1A|5|I am a singer (choir and solos) and my mouth would get so dry I could hardly sing.  My dentist recommended XyliMelts so I immediately ordered a couple of boxes.  They're GREAT!!!!  They don't create an excessive amount of saliva - just enough for me to be comfortable and able to sing.  I have them everywhere:  my bathroom, my purse, my choir folder.  They last about two hours in a singing situation.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!! .
B000HLH4RE|5|I have been looking for a convenient and healthy alternative to fluoride toothpaste. A friend mentioned Meswak. I purchased it here on Amazon from this vendor, and after using it for about a week, I like it so far. The Meswak tastes like cinnamon to me which is quite pleasant in contrasts to another natural product, Neem leaf powder, which tastes bitter like tobacco. It leaves my teeth feeling clean and my breath smelling refreshing. I've only used it for a week.<br /><br />The only negative is this - the product gives you 30 months from the stamped date for usage. My product was stamped 07/12 which gives me only a few months of usage. Although I will more than likely be finished with this tube before the date, it  would have been nice to have received a fresher product from the vendor.<br /><br />Other than that, I will more than likely repurchase this product.
B008EPPPDK|4|It has an interesting consistency. It isn't the most moisturizing. I believe the moisture boost works for my skin type (combination, sometimes dry) much better.
B00BC40U8U|5|I have used this one and the original one w/o the argan and to be honest, I can't tell a difference between the two- I love both and have been using them for a couple of years now.  They really make your hair soft and silky and makes your hair smell soo good!!  :)
B00IMLLW6A|5|My favorite - don't like to use anything else. This works well to take off makeup in a few quick swipes and doesn't leave a residue. Never makes me break out in the least. Not oily. There's nothing better for taking off eye makeup. I would choose this product a million times over the store brand eye makeup removers with their chemically products that leave somewhat sticky or oily residues. If this product does leave a residue, it's barely noticeable, and easily removes the blackest eye makeup with ease. This all natural eye makeup remover has a very faint chamomile smell. This is now the only makeup remover product I use.
B001BR4J8K|4|I just love this scent.  Light and fresh.  Great for anytime.  Just wish it didn't fade out so quickly. I give it n A.
B00DIIVM9Y|5|Handy case to carry my essentials oils in.
B00KMVFKU2|5|This is very nice quality  and it blended very well..I dyed it and it came out great
B001MS7NYU|4|What I like most about this product is that it is very light, yet gives me a dewy moist appearance under the eye. It seems to relax some of the under eye lines and great for a quick perk-up around mid-day.  It is pricey, but I use it sparingly with great results.  Most eye products are too thick/greasy for my tastes, but this is perfect!  I also like the night cream, as it is also light, yet effective.
B000EMYJ88|2|Overpriced.  Nothing better than many regular tweezers. Doesn't  have the &#34;spring&#34; tension I prefer.
B00E3N549W|4|I really enjoyed using this product because it is the perfect way to decide whether or not you want a tattoo or where to put it.  I think the kit could use some more designs though.  The first one I used smeared all over, but the others worked fine so far.  I will definitely buy this again in the future.
B007SV0B12|5|I use this for my dogs teeth as she is old and cannot get her teeth cleaned by vet with anesthesia. Helps to get the crud out and also great for me too!
B003KD5A68|5|I love these irons. I to this day can not use a clipping curling iron. The wands are so easy to use (though, it does take a few too many burns to get used to) and my hair has never held a curl in my life before I started using Cortex curling irons. I know this all sounds super fake, but I'm being sincere. With my smaller iron I don't even use hair spray or any setting/holding spray even. With the bigger wand my hair tend to give into gravity and it will loosen if I don't use a hair spray of some sort... but I am still really impressed.<br /><br />I even took it to a pre-wedding party to get ready with all the girls this past weekend and I needed up curling most of the girls hair with my wand because the clipping iron that was being used was not creating a lasting curl.<br /><br />5 stars.
B00T73KM3G|5|Love it!!
B000BIXP3A|2|I just bought this Gentle Shampoo and the Deeep Conditioner.  Sadly I was not really impressed with either one.  The shampoo didn't lather much and my hair ended up feeling not so clean.  Absolutely not worth the hefty price tag.  I'm going back to Pantene.
B001EJOQDS|4|A very thick rope like floss, but it cleans a lot better than the Glide brand I used before. It's a bit uncomfortable at first, but you get used to it.
B00LU0F8E2|1|I was doing good with this product, then suddenly I have developed dry, red, very irritated and flaky skin. Buyer beware if you have normal to dry skin, or sensitive to essential oils, willow bark extract, or alcohol.
B00JM8YXBI|3|I kind of wish it would have been a bit bigger
B00HUHJMEG|5|My wife has been very pleased with this cream! We were a little overwhelmed at the number of choices out there but decided to go with this one based on the many other positive reviews and the price was right. She has been using the cream for about two months now and really likes the results. With my wife's Prime shipping the product arrived very quickly.
B00NXZK0A4|4|Nice light but rich moisturizer, great for sensitive skin.  Would be great if they would keep this version, but also offer one with sunscreen for those of us that need protection.  They may not want to add ingredients that are not natural, but most dermatologists recommend wearing sunscreen daily to reduce risk of skin cancer.
B008QD9AJ0|5|This shampoo and conditioner combo is really wonderful.  It makes my hair feel good, it does add more volume and it has a pleasant smell.  I also bought the detangler and I have been very satisfied with that so far.  Will definitely order again.
B000P9IEO0|4|Works well. I didn't get burnt.
B000GHK6OW|4|Excellent product!
B0007LHTF6|5|Love the close shave I receive using these blades. I don't razor bumps with the use of them. Been using these brand of blades for over 7 years.
B00639DLV2|4|Usually when I use a sunscreen its very oily and i find my self burning up but this is so moisturizing minus the oil slick feel.
B00JJB1P4Q|5|The bottles are awesome and do not leak! Love they have sunction!
B009U9JUK8|5|This came super fast and is the only thing me and my family use now for our hair, skin, etc.  It really is great, we love it!
B008U8N26I|4|This product works! I had growth after only 1 week or so of use in the area of a scar that hasn't had any hair growth since I fell and struck my eye, just under the eyebrow, as a child. I was looking for options other than costly eyebrow transplants (I received a $1600 quote from a plastic surgeon!!) so I'm thrilled and looking forward to the end of the 6 weeks recommended. In the meantime, I see new growth daily!
B000O03F4O|5|Absolutely love what this has done for my damaged hair. After dying and bleaching all Fall, this product has made my hair feel soft and nice again--unlike my old shampoo which left my hair feeling brittle. It smells nice, makes me feel good, leave hair silky, and makes my scalp feel nice as well.
B000UPIQF6|5|Fast service. The Paul Mitchell Volumizer  works very well with limp hair. It is not sticky and holds the volume even during wet weather. I have used this product for several years. It is unscented and reliable. Amazon is a great way to find this product because it is not available at my supermarket and saves me an additional trip.
B004OT29MA|5|My new favorite.
B00FKIUGKG|4|very good skin product!!
B00HJKPZVI|5|It smells great
B00755FW2E|5|matches my décor, good quality.
B00LXQMZ62|5|So pretty!
B001MYYTP0|5|I would like to say that I am very happy with this product!  I leaves my hair very shiny and straight.  And also<br />very soft.  It has not damaged my hair at all.  I used a different one before and my ends were always dry and brittle.<br />Thanks for a great product!
B0012F0I7C|5|I love this gel. The can with a push button is awesome. i dont have to open or close any lids. I get exactly how much I want every time. This product works great on wet or dry hair. Holds all day if you dont run your fingers through your hair. I tend to run my fingers through my hair a lot and I can get my hands wet later in the day and run them through my hair and its like having freshly styled hair all over again. I am a big fan of this product. My 10 year old loves it also. I finally bought him his own can so he will stop stealing mine.
B005HNXJ6M|5|AMAZING smell, feel and excellent moisturizer!
B00L1KFQKC|5|Let's start with some background. I'm a young man with thick, coarse black hair past shoulder-length. I look at my dad's side of the family and see a history of unfortunate genetics in the form of baldness. That's pretty worrisome, but thankfully the hairline isn't receding yet. After some pro-active research, I decided to buy the Silk 18 natural conditioner along with Pura d'or Hair Loss Prevention shampoo. The shampoo has a strong medicinal smell, and I'm telling you this because this Silk 18 conditioner has a strong, masking vanilla scent. My hair kind of smells like spiced vanilla or root beer, which I like.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Natural and sulfate-free.<br />- Definitely silky smooth consistency.<br />- Strong vanilla scent. It isn't really subtle despite what some people say, so make sure you like vanilla before buying this.<br />- Very light feeling on hair with no residue. I also noticed unlike with typical commercial conditioners, there isn't any gunk build-up in the shower drain.<br />- No dandruff, scalp feels clean and not itchy.<br /><br />Con (just one):<br />- Only 8 ounces. I have a ton of hair so this is going to go fast. I wish Maple Holistics made a 16 oz. bottle, with a pump dispenser. That would be a dream come true.
B009QQQ30A|5|The hair was perfect other than not being the exact same color!
B0090UJFYI|3|I am still hopping to see better results , and I may order another one since every one say I should use hyaluronic acid with my derma roller .
B009T47YZ2|2|It's really pretty but it's too small for my head to be comfortable or to stay on. It's perfect for a child though!
B003EUP3O6|5|My favorite shampoo and conditioner.  Use it every day and it is awesome stuff.  Keeps the frizzies to a minimum and with the styling gel it is perfect.  Great company too.
B00FIZGLOG|4|Head and Shoulders has always been a good brand to go to for dandruff control - but one of my few issues with it has been the rather off-putting scent.  Head and Shoulders Full & Strong Dandruff Shampoo has corrected this issue, replacing the rather medicinal smell with a very light scent.<br /><br />As far as I can see this has been done without altering its dandruff control properties, and I have enjoyed using it since I was given a bottle to review.  (I can't comment as to the \\"Full and Strong\\" claims as it is difficult to tell any difference with my short hair.)  Recommended.
B003CTU5MO|5|I have 4 a/b hair and my hair HATES coconut oil so I only use JBCO.  This product is great for softening my new growth and sealing my hair including my ends.  I use it after I wash my hair and I use it to remoisturize my hair.  It works great for me all year around.
B001Q89YTI|5|I love this foundation! I was spending a lot of money on high end cosmetics because I thought that would be the only way to avoid some of the chemicals I've heard bad things about. This is one of the only drugstore foundations I've found that is paraben-free, and it works nicely for me.<br /><br />The coverage is buildable. You can go light or go full coverage, it's up to you. I like to mix equal parts of the foundation, Monistat powder gel(as a primer), and moisturizer, and then apply it with my fingers. I finish it with a mineral finishing powder, and my makeup stays on all day.<br /><br />The only problem I have is that it runs a little dark. I tried the second and third shades and they ended up a little orange-y on me. I had to get the lightest shade, and my skin is definitely not the lightest. I'm typically the second or third shade in other foundations. So if you're very fair, this probably isn't going to work for you. Then again, for the price, it's worth a shot.
B001E0VBDK|5|It smells so good and it works!
B00R1TAN7I|3|It takes a while to get used to brushing with this boar bristle hair brush. My hair is thick and find it difficult to brush thoroughly as the bristles barely reach the scalp. I wish that they could make a hybrid of sorts. A hair brush that would have sturdier but semi flexible bristles (similar to the Denman brush) incorporated to help massage the scalp for better circulation as well as the boar bristles to make hair shinier and healthier.... I'll be very interested.
B00AY1L6N0|5|Really works as stated and I saw improvement in just a few days
B0068J5K52|5|Perfect; thank you!
B000C210FU|3|the fragrant is a little over powering, so use is spearingly.
B0048IDICC|1|Received this item yesterday. The bottle wasn't full and there wasn't a safety seal on it. Probably won't use it due to these reasons
B000KIIJD2|5|I was purchasing this for my new son-in-law and had numerous questions<br />about the differneces between cologne and eau de toilette and every<br />question was responded to immediately with a clearly defined answer!<br /><br />I will definitely purchase from them again!
B00DZVKHXG|5|Best purchase I've made in the longest time. Not only do I get these really nice curls every time, I get to bond with my friends when ever they come over. They seem to come over a lot more just to use my curler. I recommended that they get their own, and one of them was like, \\"I'll get two, when payday comes, one for me and my sister.\\" And my other friend was like, \\"I'll get one, but still bring it over so you can do it for me.\\" Gosh, she's so lazy but I love her and this curler to death. I like to put the settings on really high, like all the way. I like it when my hair gets steamy and really curly. I like to look like a lion, and my friends all laugh at me for it. I just roar at them back. It's alright, I'm just having so much fun with this curler. Anyone would too, if they got one!
B00BFZFVW6|5|first time I have ordered it.  Does well as a carrier for essential oils.
B000EVGOS2|5|I am always happy with this product and it has helped my usually dry hair by making it softer<br />and healthier! never leave home without it
B001TH8Y60|4|Out of sheer curiousity, I tried these. I figured that at the very least I'd have something I could occasionally use while I'm at work & don't have access to a toothbrush. (Soup & Frito breath isn't exactly a great aroma to have on your breath.) The experience was both under & overwhelming.<br /><br />First off, I have to say that I like how tiny the brush is. It fits in my purse easily & I'll admit it- if it was bigger I'd feel guiltier about buying something big that I'm just going to dispose of afterwards. (It shouldn't get any tiner, though- as it is you'll have to put part of your hand in your mouth just to get the back teeth.) I also liked how soft the bristles were on mine. I've read how some of the bristles were harder for other users, so I don't know if it's just me or not but the bristles weren't hard at all. My teeth feel nice & clean, which is nice.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the mint drop in the middle didn't really taste all that great & I wanted to rinse my mouth out afterwards because it was such a strong taste. Since I wanted to know how long the flavor would last, I didn't & I have to say that it doesn't last as long as it would if I'd have brushed or if I'd have used some mouthwash afterwards.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good thing if you don't like bringing your toothbrush to work with you or if you are stuck in a situation where you can't, like at a work meeting or something. I do have to warn anyone who likes wearing lipstick- you WILL need to reapply your lipstick afterwards & I actually recommend removing the lipstick before brushing otherwise it'll get everywhere. This doesn't replace a good old toothbrush, but then I guess it's not supposed to. This is good for after meals where you can't get a toothbrush, but if you are traveling then I recommend popping out & getting a real toothbrush & toothpaste.
B00A20OQYE|5|Nice variety of brushes.  Great value!
B00HUBZCBO|5|Delightful smell!
B003TU4CB6|5|I ordered this because I had heard about the healing properties of manuka honey and thought it might help with my rosacea. While it didn't help the rosacea, it does help with the dryness I experience from it as long as I use it regularly. It's delicate enough I can use it twice a day and even with my sensitive skin, I've had no problems using it. It also has a nice, light scent. My second jar should be arriving in a few days! :)
B004O15ONY|5|i love this Boyfriend spray 'i use to buy something the same at victoria secrets ;not again this is really good i love the smell it is not strong and the oil drys so quick .Best ever ,
B0037BOLVS|1|I believe the product was tainted. The shampoo did not smell like purology. There was a hint of amonia to the sent. This is not normal for pureology products. I will never buy this product through this source again. Back to getting my supply from the slaon directly.
B002LJUD6O|5|Gave it to my daughter and she loves it. Received it quicker than thought I would. Will buy from this seller again.
B0035CFY24|5|Fast Shipment!!! Works great combine with other products !!!! I would defininely recommend.to friends and family to use for any at home remedies !! Is great in making at hair treatments!!!
B00Q0IDADA|5|This curler worked great on my short , straight lashes.  I had stopped using other ones so much because they were pulling out my lashes and pinching my eyelids,  but this one did none of that.  It allowed me to get a nice curved lash and didn't pinch at all.  YAY.  It fits comfortably in my hand and gives me the control I need to get the inner lashes ,  as well as the outer,  at the same time.  I really like the pad too.  It has more give and bounce to it,  than the others I have purchased.  Really happy with it.<br />I received this eyelash curler free for the purpose of testing and review.  All opinions are my own.
B000O1NORG|5|I love Jean Nate. I just wish that they would make he cologne again. I really, really, really miss it.
B00FU2K7ME|5|Excellent fast delivery. Marked Paris & New York not CHINA ET AL! Classic fragrance at a very nice price !! A-1 truly a gift that will keep on giving & your lady will love you for it! Merry Christmas to one & all! R. H.
B00GBJ9E9C|5|For those of you with fine hair this is a miracle worker!  I finally have full hair that doesn't go flat an hour after I style it.
B005DJ2FMO|5|This stuff is great. Works great for summer time. Don't use it in the winter. Wipes on wet but instantly turns into powder. Gave it as a gift to a friend of mine and he now orders his own. IF you suffer from sweaty balls during the summer this product is for you
B0016M1PVY|4|This color is amazing! It is a really pretty cool tone grey with a slight taupe undertone. Its not too dark but its still not too light so right in the middle. The brush I will say is extremely thin so it takes a little longer to do a full coat. The reason why it bothers me is because it makes me have to re dip the brush several times and can make it hard to get an even coat. The polish itself is also a little sheer so you will need to do 3 coats for a truly opaque finish. I only use two just for the sake of saving polish but it is streaky so if that bothers you use 3 coats. Overall the color is amazing but for a china glaze polish I expected a more opaque polish. Shipping was also extremely fast. 3 Days max!
B002U1PVDS|1|I think the lancets I received were corroded.  Some dark stuff that came off on my fingers when I tried opening two.  Definitely not sterile then right? I want a refund.
B0009V8N5E|5|It is the best color, nice smell easy to apply, a little pricey, but we get what we pay for. I would buy over an d over, very happy with this product.
B009NPOXT2|5|Daughter loves it.  Good price.
B009LOJ5MA|5|This is the only cream that Really Works!! I've used other creams and this is by far the best one that shows noticeable results, the only one that I'll continue using, worth every penny!!! Been using it over a month now and am very pleased with the results!!! The Real Deal!<br />And I am so Happy to Announce that I did in fact recieved my free bottle just for calling the 800 number on the bottle!!! It was shipped really fast:) I am so excited to see the results happening from this cream!!! I can truly see myself cellulite free very soon:))
B000QYEK88|4|It is one of the best shaves I have ever had.
B001EJONOK|5|The best brush shave cream I have found. I use it daily to achieve a clean, comfortable shave.The shaving brush is not obsolete with this cream
B00935AXAU|5|it does the job.
B004ERXVWE|3|Great, but super duper tiny for the price.  I don't know what I was expecting though.  I used it up entirely for my lid and brow bone.  Shimmery and sparkly but also pigmented.  Won't repurchase due to other more cheaper brands have similar shade...
B009NNFB0O|4|Just grew a beard for the first time a few months ago and I was looking for a product that would take away the feeling of having a field of wheat growing on my face. The product works as advertised leaving the hair feeling much softer and less unruly. The product smells &#34;vegan&#34; but certainly not unpleasant. I will buy more when the first canister runs out.
B000052XZX|5|For over 10 years, I have suffered from extremely dry scalp and scalp acne to the point to where I was constantly scratching my scalp so much that it would be raw and bleed and I started losing my hair quickly.  I tried many over the counter medicated shampoos, organic all-natural shampoos, I went to the dermatologist and tried medicated shampoos and I even tried home remedies such as tea tree oil, neem oil and apple cider vinegar rinse.  Nothing worked and I would cry as all hope would wash down the drain with my hair.  I even started washing my hair only once a week in an attempt to not lose as much hair.  I was browsing my local pharmacy the other day and came across the T-Sal Scalp Build-Up Control Shampoo.  I figured \\"what do I have to lose but $7?\\"  The first time I tried it, I will be honest and say I did not follow the directions exactly as stated on the bottle and because of that, I did not get the results I expected.  A week later (today) I tried it again and using some suggestions from fellow reviewers on here, I followed the directions exactly...I lathered it on my hair and left it in for FIVE minutes. Then I rinsed and lathered again and left it on for another FIVE minutes.  I noticed that the second lather foamed up a lot more and I believe it's because the first application removed the build-up and the second lather did it's \\"medicinal\\" purposes.  I did not condition my hair.  I noticed that I did not lose as much hair in this wash.  I figured after air drying, that my hair would be unmanageable & dry because I did not use conditioner (I have very coarse, frizzy, wavy hair).  On the contrary, it dried soft to the touch and I noticed it did not take as long to flat iron my hair. AND...for the first time in TEN years, I actually see a majority of a pink scalp rather than a white, dry, flaky scalp all over.  And I am not itching nearly as much I do on a daily basis.  If this is just after one (following directions exactly) try, then I can't wait to see results after one or two weeks.  I truly believe that after all these years, my scalp problem is a result of over processed hair and the use of chemical-ridden hair products and all I needed was a shampoo to help rid my scalp of that build-up.  TRY THIS...it's worth it!  (P.S. the acne is only at the nape of my neck, under my hair...I did not notice any relief from this shampoo, but I am now targeting that area with acne medication).
B0012WTHQS|5|I was introduced to this product at Cowlick's, a wonderful Japanese hair salon in NYC. It is slightly sticky but not dry like clay. So, depending on the length & characteristics of your hair & how much of the product you use, it could hold shapes or just keep your hair looking smooth instead of fuzzy when it's super humid. Great stuff.
B00A6VN56E|5|I think the shampoo and conditioner help to make my Brazilian treatment last longer.  I really like these products a lot.
B001P1ZC92|1|I have to admit i only used this once.. I cant bring myself to use it again.. it is stinky i think and i didn't see that it worked either.. It could have just been my attitude over the smell.. I really just prefer no fragrance..I don't like the fragrance in the smooth shampoo and conditioner either but they work amazing!..[[ASIN:B001P1ZEMC L'Oreal Paris EverPure Smooth Conditioner, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]] [[ASIN:B001P24STQ L'Oreal Paris EverPure Smooth Shampoo, 8.5-Fluid Ounce]] .. This just doesnt do it for me
B001JQLNM8|3|Avg. product, little \\"gel filling\\" you get what you pay for. for the price, it is ok.
B000GHVKEW|5|This scent is so intoxicating! I love that its a strong, long lasting scent with a clean finish.  The notes pair so well together. I'd recommend this scent to anyone 21+ This scent may get you into trouble if you have a boyfriend or husband! ;-):-)
B00EPZCE78|5|ABSOLUTELY HELPFULL... IT WORKS SO GREAT... I LIKE IT SO MUCH...
B000052YOX|5|Good moisturizer that isn't too greasy.
B005IIA5XG|5|Absolutely love it. It is the<br />Best toothpaste I have ever tried. It whitens your teeth & good for sensitive gums.
B002Z38M4Q|1|The other review is absolutely correct. I have bought this product before from other locations and it is a thick creamy body wash that smells like lavender and mint (as it should!). This product is the consistency of milk and smells like nothing.<br /><br />It is not the correct product at all! I have no idea what I was about to put all over my body! Avoid!
B0015I4LUQ|5|Excellent exfoliator!!<br />A must have for a nice close shave!<br />Thank you.
B000WOS71I|5|Remarkable difference on my skin !! cleared up dry , flaky areas within a week!! highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin! throw away everything else!!!
B00LVPDBA4|5|I have been using the Phillips Sonicare HX6212/05 for over 6 months now and I definitely notice an improvement in my dental health. My teeth seem brighter and my gums overall just feel much cleaner and healthier after using this product compared to my old Oral-B electric toothbrush. It comes with a great hard cover travel case that fits the brush and 2 heads, which I find infinitely superior to the older model's soft pouch traveling case. My only gripe with this toothbrush is that I have to take off the head and clean out the brush and head with a Q-tip to prevent mold from building up.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very strong vibration<br />-Nice hard cover travel case<br />-Comes with a second brush head<br />-Paid $30 for mine when there was a coupon clipping<br />Cons:<br />-Can be a bit loud but this doesn't bother me at all but it might bother others<br />-Have to remove head and clean to prevent molding
B001E96LUO|5|For all you sensitive people out there..THIS IS THE WAY TO GO! I've went through countless facial washes for sensitive skin and this is the only one that did the job and did it WELL! I can't go a day without using it and just one bottle lasts a little over a month, sometimes more. And I use it twice a day! The best part is how soft and refreshed your face feels afterwards. There is a hint of menthol in it which made me hesitant, but it wasn't an issue with my super sensitive skin. Just made the refreshing part that much enjoyable! And for the most important part, IT CLEARS ME RIGHT UP. I used to get what seemed like knots on my face because I had a hint of cystic acne, but since I've been using this product for about 5 months...I rarely see anything like that anymore. Just a few little pimples here and there. It's great! I've never been more happy with my skin!
B000Q6WBQE|3|Reasons I gave three stars : tint instructions are easy and they are packaged as described... The only problem is the tint only last three days.. I thought I was doing it wrong but I left it on for 20 mintues the second time and same results.
B0002OSDG2|2|I so so wanted to try this and like it...but just like the Murad line I first tried back in 2003, caused an allergic reaction (sulfur). Now, after just a week...I'm experiencing itching all over and notice my torso is a little red. At first, I thought it was the cold/dry winter weather making my skin itch and me, trying to use more lotion to relieve it...but nope, this morning I looked closely at my arms and upper torso and notice that I've broken out in hives :( Well, no more Murad for me and I have a whole bottle left too....Guess I'll stick to my ACV, Aloe Vera, Coconut oil and clay masks instead of trying to take the easy way out.
B001G47SI6|4|I've used this cleanser for eight months and it really makes a difference in your skin. It stings a little, but that's because it's working.
B00LNS7Y34|1|product arrived and most of the shadows were broken. It was just a mess everywhere. SO DISAPPOINTED!
B00AFCP6NY|4|Good results so far. I'm not sure if or how the power feature improves performance, and sometimes I forget to turn it on, but I feel like I'm keeping up with the Jones's.
B00I48BI3S|1|I made the mistake of buying 5 of these, even though I have never tried them before. I can't even use them. The colors are very pretty but no matter how smooth and hydrated my lips are all you see is lip stick built up in the cracks of my lips. I have tried everything to make it work and nothing works. Luckily I only got 3 of the 5 so far so I can still return the other 2 when they get here. Trust me when I say you are better off not wasting your money on this product.
B0055STG84|5|I purchased this thinking I was purchasing a special deal on the more expensive brand of Bare Minerals.<br />Although there was a little initial dissapointment, I decided to try it out. I had read the reviews on the brushes and decided to not even open them.<br />I was pleasantly surprised that I thought the poor reviews had really exaggerated, I felt that it was pretty good makeup with pretty good coverage. I wasn't going to re-order my Bare Minerals right away, I felt that this make up was fine, and there is a good chance I might switch due to the price difference.<br /> My 14 yr. old daughter likes it better than Bare Minerals ( smirk), so that gives it 5 stars in my book, she will now leave my makeup alone!<br />Turns out, she liked the brushes, they really weren't that terrible, what I expect from these cheaper package deals.<br />When it comes time to re-order, I will re-order this brand, it is a big cost savings and the only difference I see is the packaging.
B002DJU37G|3|This shampoo is just ok.  Does not lather enough for me and the smell is nothing special.  I would not purchase again.
B0091OCBJ4|4|I like this a lot BUT when I started using it twice a day, my skin began to get very dry and rough...Once a day is fine.<br />Really, this is the first brand I've tried that has a very high rating on EWG, and also works. Seems to have a filling effect on those unattractive lines around my mouth. Lifting and firming, as advertised.
B00BWS50RW|4|The clippers worked great! I used them in New Zealand. They were light and compact enough that they didn't take up too much space. They were durable and had full power when I used them.<br />Only downside for me is that I normally tweak my clippers blades position so that I can cut to bald and do my hair line. These would not u adjust them that low. So that was a bummer.<br />But, I'd still highly recommend them!
B001B9G4AO|5|excellent
B00AYZTQ9W|5|I love IT products and this lipstick is no exception. Feels great on my lips!
B009SOT4GA|1|This stuff was so hard to use because just the tiniest drop made me look I just step on stage at the Moulan Rouge.
B004WPGXMI|5|Very good.. like a lot
B000O3BDHW|5|Wonderful red/purple color that stays unchipped for days! Girls I hang out with constantly ask me \\"what color is that,\\" followed by a \\"where'd you get it?\\".<br /><br />A tip: if you want a darker shade, paint on two layers. Paint one hand then the next, come back to the first hand you painted (it should be semi-dry) and go once more over it for a smooth and darker color.
B0081NLRE6|4|Too pricey. But works.
B00MJG8618|5|First timer for this product and I love it.  Took me a few minutes to figure it out, but when I removed it, my skin looked AMAZING!  Just purchased a few other &#34;flavors&#34;.  Looking forward to trying those out.
B0018C0HLQ|4|Little foam hexagons. I didn't realize they were going to be foam. They last forever and are great.
B005TT8VMG|4|Smells very nice and fruity :) ...but yeah it did remind me of a tropical car air freshener. Not that that is bad because it DOES smell good. It's just that people may ask if you got your car detailed recently.
B0047EPULY|5|my favorite color.
B006L6908A|5|I struggle with dry/irritated skin and this smoothed my skin almost as well as Nivea Creme. The smell stayed on for a really long time and was enjoyable. I guess I would describe it as not very sweet but not very masculine it that makes sense. Will buy again.
B0041R7C4A|5|Love it!
B000OYJ9AO|5|This is a wonderful product. I love the scent and the way it feels on my skin. I use it all the time!!
B00D9D9EFC|5|I am not a hardcore all-natural type of consumer and still have non-mineral products in my collection, but recently I decided to give mineral eye shadow a try and I am pleased and will probably go with mineral shadow from now on.<br /><br />When applied with a moist brush the colors really pop around the eyes and I have been able to play around and get some very delicious looks using this eye shadow.<br /><br />The containers have an insert like a salt or pepper shaker and what I do is shake out a small amount into the lid and it keeps the rest of it safe from any gusts of wind or fans that might be nearby. The insert can be removed though if you need to get to the powder directly.<br /><br />The containers are also quite small but if you are a person who only puts makeup on occasionally or just not every day, they may be perfect. If you are a heavy makeup user you may want to find larger containers. They are definitely the perfect size to test out whether or not you like the makeup. I had zero problems with the size of them personally but I have read a lot of reviews on similar makeups complaining about the size.<br /><br />There was a slight shipping mixup where I was sent everything but this set, and in this set's place was a different one. I contacted the seller and was sent the correct set without hassle and I didn't even need to ship the other one back! Excellent!<br />I will definitely buy again.
B00J0OJJHW|5|I love this pencil. I have dark brown hair and taupe is perfect.
B0045VPINO|1|very disappointed with the fabric and the colors!!!!
B001B6963O|5|It works
B003JMYYQW|4|Have been using this product for many years.  It is easy to handle and dries and styles my hair to my liking.  You just have to be careful not to touch the metal part of the brush because it can burn your finger.  Overall I would recommend it to a friend.
B004220DQ8|5|Love it, great color.
B003KWVOD2|4|Great shave
B008PEXV3Q|5|i use this to decorate my phone, nails and crafts. great price. ive use all of them. loved it, really great !!
B00LJO6DYS|4|It seems to work very well, the product came complete and works. I have to wait a few weeks to see if works for me
B007XUP28U|5|wonderfu and light
B001ADSI3C|4|Great product!
B000I5HJ2Y|5|I used sponges to apply foundation when I was younger, but I thought they made the foundation go on too thick. These are perfect. They blend the foundation into my skin and I can easily add more coverage where I need to. I wet the sponge, squeeze out excess water, and then dab it with a towel before using.
B000HDLD9C|5|I've been lookin for a good moisturizer that wouldnt make me break out for.. forever, and I spotted this at TJ Maxx and decided to try it out since it was only $6.99. I wasn't disappointed one bit. this cream, I don't know what's in it but I woke up the next morning and my face was nearly clear (acne scars and zits).. it must like super charge your skin cells or something to make them \\"turn over\\" overnight? I've been using this for about 2 weeks now and haven't broken out once, my face is clearer than ever. even my scars are disappearing! and guess what? I even skipped wearing any foundation yesterday! :) I'm so happy I found something that is kind to my sensitive skin and is actually making it look gorgeous at the same time.<br />I really encourage everybody with problem skin to buy I and try it out.<br />You won't be sorry!:)
B0049JPZTO|4|I used too much the first time and it left a film.  You only need a tiny dab.  I can see where short hair styles could benefit from this more…but I like it for certain times…I have shoulder length hair.
B00I32AN4K|5|Very surprised, it actually helped to repair my super damaged hair
B008F5D0XG|3|As described.  The inclusion of the screw driver was especially helpful.  There is some concern that the batteries will charge properly because they are NiMH replacing NiCad.  One charge so far seems to be okay.  If no small solder experience/ equipment available don't attempt. It is difficult to remove circuit board and unsolder old batteries and solder new batteries without spreading solder on adjacent terminals.
B00LZWV0WY|5|I bought this cream for my wife and she absolutely loves it. We had a hard time finding a healthy alternative to the lotions out there loaded with chemicals and this one is perfect.
B009W6STV0|3|This notebook sleeve is well-constructed and the neoprene is quite thick and feels nice in the hand. The zippers are nice and smooth and don't have any drag around the corners.<br /><br />The problem is that it is too big for my Asus notebook. I am looking for a close-fitting sleeve - the width of this one is perfect but it is about 1.5&#34; too tall.<br /><br />I can't find a sleeve that is the right size so I am making one myself. In the meantime, I am using this sleeve.
B007O7AZ3O|5|I got the Real Techniques eye brush set, but the liner brush included with it was too large for my uses.  I like to use a fine brush for liner, and have the option to just build it if I want a larger line.  I find it easier, and more versatile.<br /><br />This brush is perfect! Well made, fine but still manageable and easy to use with my gel liner.  I cannot express how much I love this brush!
B009783UOY|5|Great Jars. Opaque and stackable.
B00288BVOQ|3|I have perspiration problems, and tried this out to see if it would help. I have noticed a decrease in the amount of sweat I've been getting, but I still end up with pit stains at the end of the day. The product suggests applying it before you go to bed, but my morning routine requires a shower, so I have to apply after I dry myself off.<br /><br />This is a solid deodorant, so try to apply it and allow a bit of time to dry before putting on a shirt, or else you'll get the white marks on the inside of your shirt.
B003H60F3G|4|This is a great product smells good . The only downside is you have to turn the powder container upside down to get the power on to the puff.
B00MGXV2IS|3|Have to be very careful around the eyes or oil gets swept into the eye with lashes. I like a cleanser I can use around my eyes for cleaning. However once oils enter eye difficult to shed oil for awhile and that is uncomfortable.  It's like water resistant sunscreens in the eye area. Like the feel and smell.
B001A82DY2|3|It does seem to make my hair fuller but the powder is very fine and a lot does get on the sclap and look like patches of brown
B002N5MHLU|5|Very please, very close shave and great value.
B0002Z8KAU|5|Great product. Just like what I buy from the salon.
B004KU9PN4|4|I bought this for my son. He has a scar on his upper lip where he got stitches. I put it on every night and he never fights (for a toddler that is saying something). I have started using it on my lips overnight as well. Great during these terrible allergy seasons.
B00GOYH4PA|5|It's great as a moisturizer. I had a small crack at the corner of my mouth and the Argan oil healed it quickly.
B00SC7ZOP4|3|I like it but they had to send my package twice so it took over a month for me to recv.it 😒
B005Z2X5JQ|5|Love love love this Wen!!  BEST scent, works perfect on my hair.  I'd use this all year around.
B000BEZO8I|3|I don't like the oil-control face powder,they send it to me ,because I ordered the the transglo pressed dark .<br />I'm dark skin like the soufflé
B0087QFTOG|5|This was a very well designed product. The last around the neck mirror that I bought had a very small bar to stabilize it and did not work, it was returned. This works good. I have one that I have had for about 40 years and this Hands Free Mirror is the only thing I ever found to replace my worn old mirror.
B003TQTFVW|3|Good size for travelling.  It is the simplest blow dryer, but it gets the job done.  The only thing is that it is extremely loud.  However, since I only use it when I am not at my house, it suits its purpose.
B00FAP3QH4|4|Love this hair clip... holds just the right amount of hair away from my face and seems to be quite sturdy!
B00F64NGEW|3|Made me chuckle, but for the cost it is a really tiny package. Gum was just okay also.
B00028M3N2|4|I thought I was purchasing something else but this came and I will have to find uses for it.  Very strong lemon scent but it smells good.
B005B0LC3S|5|I received this item at a discount in return for my unbiased opinion. I normally wouldnt try a yellow color on my eyes, but Im glad I gave it a shot. Since its a mineral color, its lighter than regular shadows, so its pretty. Its a great summer/spring color and I love shading with it. Bare Escentuals has never let me down yet!
B00912CL5K|4|Picture is fairly accurate to the actual product, which is always a plus. Clip doesn't hold a lot of hair, but it was cheap, and cute, so I can't really complain here.
B000BRMBDG|5|I used to always see women using this when I was little. I thought it was so fancy to see them with the powder puff...like the movies. As an adult, this item has been hard to find. This is a vintage type of item which is still made with the same formula I remember as a kid, and I'm glad I was able to find this as an adult. I put it on in the morning and love the smell it gives. Makes me feel very feminine and having very fair skin, it's nice to find something that blends nicely. Can't beat it for the price!!!!
B003WR3QSG|5|Excellent feel and lathers efficiently.  Holds a fair amount of water.  Fits in standard holder with no issue.
B004N8H2H4|5|I absolutely LOVE this salve! It's super moisturizing and smells good too! Plus so versatile! I use it on my lips, cuticles, and elbows and it moisturizes all three incredibly well.
B00CFNBDBA|5|Sublime Beauty.....never let's me down! Once again, I am totally blown away with how great a product this Fresh Citrus Scrub is! When it comes to exfoliating my skin and leaving it naturally beautiful, nothing beats this scrub. This product is, by far, way superior to other brand-name products I have tried in the past. I have very sensitive, sort of acne-prone skin & this Fresh Citrus Scrub doesn't irritate it at all. It also does a great job balancing my skin & giving it a smooth, soft texture. My skin has changed from dull to glowing BC I use this scrub in the morning, followed by Sublime Beauty's ageless serum with Renovage & Matrixyl & finishing my morning routine with Face Whisperer day cream. My night time beauty ritual is to first, wash with fresh citrus scrub, followed by ageless serum again, hyaluronic serum or collagen mask, finished off with Face Whisperer night cream. All products are Sublime Beauty bc in my personal opinion they have the best face products! I received a discount on this scrub for my honest evaluation & it is now my new favorite face scrub!
B000GSSQ8Y|5|I completely agree with the other two five-star reviews.  This product is refreshing but not overpowering. I absolutely love it.<br /><br />Please, Bath & Body Works, get with the program and make more of this product!!
B00D6OWWQC|5|Best natural deodorant I've tried by far. Works better than traditional deodorant.
B00JAOM5HS|5|Absolutely great, it's just as sharpe and cuts like the original BRAUN. I'm looking to order more but I can't remember what company I ordered it from. Can you tell me?
B0000AOWP8|5|All mothers should give their daughters this product and keep the razor out of their hands. I have used this for years and have to shave my legs every other week
B00PV15BPW|5|Nice strong smell. Fast shipping! Great Product!!!
B0002L93N2|5|I have curly hair that reaches just below my shoulders.  I bought this iron hoping it would give me long loose curls.  It seems my hair is not quite long enough for that.  However, it does straighten my hair quickly and give it one stretced out S wave that allows for some body.  I prefer this to using a flat iron.  I think this would give you curls if your hair goes down past your bust.  It is a bit have and awkward to use at first, but I got used to it quickly and managed not to burn myself or drop it.  I am glad I purchased this iron.
B000ILKUVA|5|This is the first frankincense essential oil I've tried and Im quite pleased with the results. I put it directly on my forehead to calm myself before sleep and also to diminish wrinkles. Another plus is frankincense has anti-melanoma properties (in horses). I like the frankincense aroma (smells like church) lots better than Aura Cacia's myrrh or lemon. Aura Cacia makes good quality oils at reasonable prices. Aura Cacia's definitely higher quality than NOW or \\"Herb And Oil\\" brands.
B001U7VW7M|5|I use this product and i love it it is a very hard item to find as this is discontinued sorry to hear but will order again Thank You
B0006HCE60|5|Good project. Purchased for my daughter to use for her homemade lip balm. It worked great and did the job.
B001FNRHX4|5|Love, love, love this product.  The smell is wonderful.  Make the skin super soft.
B004PATFDO|5|It gives me just the right amount of color and keeps my lips from becoming dry and chapped.
B005KR4U6S|3|This item leaves too thick of a gap so air seeps out, cannot get a good enough seal it see if it helps with nose discomfort.
B007HLWNT6|5|This is the best moisturizer I've ever used. It's worth every cent.<br />You need to use very little.  My face has never felt so soft.<br />I've been using this for 2 years now and can see lines in my cheeks diminished.
B002QANC2A|4|I like this set, used it for the first time this morning. It is something that you need space for as the kit is so big, but its nice if you like variety. I was worried that the eye shadow wouldn't smell good but they smell O.K. Its a nice experiment.
B000H3I3OK|5|I hated it when Revlon discontinued my favorite shade of lipstick, glad I found it here!  It's a perfect, soft light brick/coral shade with a natural tone, not too bright, and goes with everything.
B001QJQNQY|5|This is hands down my favorite hair product!  I love the subtle shine it gives my hair but without leaving it greasy feeling!  It also smells AMAZING!  A little bit goes a long way...my bottle lasted me over a year!  I love this stuff!
B007LSIW7W|5|Great product- have used it for years.  I won't use a moisturizer without sunscreen.  This does the job.
B00T1HQ7S2|5|LOVE IT! I got this on time, 500 nails exact, They are tough so they won't break too easily, the sizes fit my little fingers! ^_^
B00TSTZQEY|3|The actual oil itself is great, but I wasn't all that thrilled with the fact that my dropper came shattered in a million pieces. Fairly disappointing, but I am enjoying the lavender oil.
B00AHH00MO|2|Says it's non-greasy; is very greasy.  The smell is also a bit much. I returned this and bought some Eucerin which, while also greasy, at least doesn't stink like a teenager wearing Axe body spray.
B006YFCHSS|5|Soft and perfect size! It gets all the hair off. Works way better than the ones that come with most trimmers.
B001KYQ1I0|1|this is a very drying product.  I should have tried it in a store before I bought it here because the color is not what i expected either.
B004I36V0I|5|This gel makes my skin feel wonderful and gives me just the small amount of color that I need.  I don't need to add anything except some moisturizer.  Fabulous stuff!
B000V2ACH8|5|I like that I can style my hair perfectly with this and still move and restyle it throughout the day. Superb quality.
B00DTPZXLY|5|Dries a bit slow, but my wife reports she really likes it, and it only takes one coat. Shipping great.
B000EGK9VU|3|The soap itself is great, only 3 stars because I can't get past the fragrance. My face didn't dry out and was very smooth feeling. I now have it at my kitchen sink and I must admit, my hands are softer this winter!
B000NT2EE8|4|I bought this all the time, then ventured away, and then found it back here for a great value so I had to buy again.  Phisoderm really gives that clean feeling and removes all makeup and oil.  I love that this was a two pack because I can keep one in the shower and one at the sink, something I always mean to do but forget when I'm buying.
B005WKM8OY|1|This didn't do good at all my hair was still blond
B006KHFP8Y|4|it is very good
B0030HMQTS|5|Nice, good, dense and affordable.
B007U90J5U|5|This was my second order. I have gone threw four bottles already. I am hooked. My friend is also hooped. I got her into it too. lol Works perfect. when you paint your nails you don't really want to wait for them to dry so you put this on and it works as a fast-dry and top coat. Two in one. Can't beat it!
B009TB7Q1W|1|would not recommend
B003UNP20W|5|Asked for this set for Christmas, so glad I did! They work amazing and are such good quality! In my opinion way more worth it than Mac!
B003OVI21G|5|This can cause sensitivity, but it worked as early as the first 3 treatments!  I could whiten my teeth for weeks and still have plenty of whitening gel left.  This works, and it is a fantastic price for the results!
B004ZXN3XO|1|I read several reviews which stated this item quit working after 1-4 weeks. Well mine worked exactly twice. Make that 1.5 times. The 1st use when I closed the lid, The ultra blue violet light came on bright & kinda cool looking. The 2nd time the blue light came in very fun & then went out altogether after about 1 minute. I tested the batteries which were brand new with a full charge. 3rd try the green indicator light came on as it did the previous uses. However no blue light at all. I've tried it at least 25X and the uv light simply will not turn on. I've read so many reviews with similar problems.  A problem like this reported by so many people needs to be thoroughly & quickly implemented.
B007HJ9VFM|5|Great piece...trimmer works perfectly.  battery life is great, but i only use this as needed  No Issues at all....Great buy
B00L2SWF7K|1|I do not like it at all. Not absorbing, not seeing any improvement
B006CQKQ46|5|I'm glad I purchased these candles the vanilla sent is just what I hoped it would be not to mild and not to strong a vanilla scent. I do wish they were bigger.
B00H6PHS66|3|thank
B004367X70|5|Product came earlier than expected.  Works great for kids and adults.  All directions are in Chinese, but if your a 80s or 90s kid you don't need them.
B009VJ0T84|5|I didn't even know they made clips this big!!! I works great for my lond hair and I can keep my hair off my back for the hot summer days!!!
B000P20QT8|3|it came super fast...however the reviews talked this scent up and when i got it....it smelled just like all the other celebrity endorsed scents...nothing spectacular. I felt i had too many that smelled exactly the same. I got it for a good price.
B000UZB3Z6|5|I really like the new blade
B0027EWWIK|4|I thought it worked well.  My skin looked better.  I would reccommend it to anyone.  I only used one container.
B000XTGPZ2|5|loved! Very Sexy Looking
B00138Q4OO|5|I love Surgi wax!  I love the strips - they are easy to use and really pull out a lot of hair.  They are better than your average wax strips for sure.  I've used all the grocery store brands (Sally, Nair etc.) and these seem to be the best.  If you buy the large sized wax strips you can just cut the strips down to your preferred size as well.
B00006L9CA|5|I bought this shaver after owning earlier Braun models. I was diappointed with my last shaver in that it only lasted 4 years. (Braun gives shavers a 5-7 year life.) This one manages the battery charging which I believe will extend the life of the battery which is what failed on the last one. Worse yet, the battery was attached to a PC board and could not be replaced economically. <br />I read reviews prior to buying this model. The chief complaint was the cost of the cleaning cartridges, since they are quoted at a cartridge per month. It turns out to be much better than expected. First of all, the cartridges come 2 to a pack and are discounted online. Second, you need not clean the shaver each day. I clean mine every other shave and my cartridge worked fine for 2 1/2 months. <br />One last thing. I was able to take a week vacation without taking the cleaner stand along. The unit has more than adequate battery power to last the entire week and you need only brush out the shaver manually until you return home.
B002HRENL6|4|I bought this handy little wall hair dryer in 8/2010. Haven't had any problems so far and use it almost everyday.
B00FBPE79Y|4|Got for my husband as a bday gift, he really likes it! It took a couple shaves to get used to considering he had always shaved with a razors but this cuts time in half and leaves a smooth clean face.
B00GRUM71M|5|These are my favorite headbands for my 5 month old daughter. The flower is adorable and I love the actual band of the headband because it is stretchy and I know that she will be able to wear it as she grows (and I think it would've fit when she was younger also). It doesn't leave a mark or imprint on her head at all; she doesn't even notice the headband. The shipping takes a little while but I still received mine a couple days earlier than it estimated. Great product for a great price!
B0019CVT44|5|I love this product
B0014ZWHDS|5|This is the best hair spray!  I have used it for over 25 years and it is getting hard to find.  Maybe people LIKE to pay MORE for the same thing?  I don't!
B001QY8QXM|3|To me the blades are just okay. They dull pretty fast in my opinion, after just a couple of shaves. I would suggest using Merkur blades, they last a lot longer. It's like anything else, you get what you pay for. I wouldn't by any means say not to buy them, but just know that you won't be getting top notch quality.
B0064FF3XO|5|I used to use Origin's Reinventing the Heel.  It was a little pricey, but it worked really well.  It kept my heels and feet very smooth.  For some reason, they quit making it and I was left looking for something that worked as well.  I found it in AmLactin Foot Cream.  My feet are as smooth as silk.  AmLactin is just as effective as the more expensive Origin cream, and it's probably half the price.
B001A4F398|4|I think my problem is genetics and short of cosmetic surgery...I'm stuck with it. But I thought it worked for early morning tiredness
B001HKR6WM|5|Great quality for such a cheap price and very useful for beginners! Wish it came with a package to hold all the brushes though, aside from that wonderful.
B001CJFEMC|5|Some sunscreens irritate my skin, but this one does not. Great for everyday use, is invisible on the skin, and skin doesn't turn chalky white. Goes on smoothly, and seems moisturizing. Nice for dry skin, some may not like it if skin a bit oilier. Has not caused breakouts on my skin. I use Skinceuticals \\"30\\" when I expect to have more sun exposure, but I prefer the consistency of this product (\\"20\\") under makeup for daily use, since it seems like a moisturizer rather than a sunscreen, it is more thin and less sticky. A bit pricy so mostly just use on my face and neck.
B00A63WI6K|5|Love it. it came early too and my favorite perfume ever it is a must try do it. Ok ok
B00FQ13MPI|4|I order 4 of these n 3 were good. But I'm a lil confused why 1 of the boxes has a cvs sticker n electronic device on it. Not the same as the other boxes.
B007AWOF52|5|Great service, great product.  Thanks.
B004DK7DVC|1|My hair is naturally golden blonde and I've never dyed or highlighted it in my life. I've used this product 7 times as directed, (sprayed onto towel dried hair and then applied heat by blow drying and straightening or curling) and I haven't seen any results at all, and neither have my friends or family. I see more results just by going out in the sun for 1 day without having used any products. I wouldn't recomend this product for natural, un-dyed blondes.
B0006PS3Y4|5|as expected
B007F6FCS2|5|Great and good looking mug.  I will give years of service.
B00ILCCUN4|5|Love them!
B000NLHXEC|4|Works when you workout
B005PLQIQ4|5|I grew up using Colgate, but I switched to Crest during adulthood. I consciously made the switch because I found Crest milder tasting than Colgate.  Recently, I have switched back and forth.  Crest has fluoride (like Colgate) and a variety of versions (and flavors).  I now often choose the greater value according to price and volume.<br /><br />What I noticed first off about Crest \\"Complete\\" is that it is a step closer to tasting like Colgate (i.e. stronger).  They have added Scope(TM) mouthwash, and it is only slightly milder than most of Colgate's toothpaste.  Besides the freshness and strong flavor for your breath, it cleans your teeth effectively.  I have noticed less to floss and less to clean after brushing.  That is the greatest benefit, which I like best of all:  If it can keep the tartar off your teeth for more months until your next cleaning, it has clearly done its job.  So far it is the best \\"tartar control\\" toothpaste I have ever used.
B0038TN6JM|5|This is a great product because it doesn't leave your hair dry and it has a wonderful tingle to it with the conditioner.
B0018QHSAA|4|it's just makeup
B002ANLL1W|3|Bought this perfume at Macys 2 yrs ago and fell in love with it!!! Went back to purchase it and they dont carry it anymore:( Found it on Amazon.....Not sure if they Burberry modified the perfume but Im just not in love with it anymore.
B006PK4NQ6|1|I was disappointed with the coverage. Otherwise it's great on my sensitive skin.
B008BHO53M|1|The trimmer arrived in a confusing package with a hazmat label, despite it having no batteries (as was advertised and known), let alone the supposed lithium ion battery stated on the caution sticker.  The trimmer looked like a bargain until I inserted the two new AA batteries of my own and discovered it wouldn't work.  I have returned the unit under Amazon's return policy; and have asked for a replacement.
B00EP5S7HE|5|Love this product!
B005CWS2C4|4|My little sister is going to love this! It is a normal tooth brush that sings two songs. The songs aren't as clear as I wish...but it will be a fun gift!
B00FOLPQPE|5|Really happy with it! it's long , shiney , & beautiful. Super pleased !✌️
B00GQJR25A|4|My hair probably isn't quite long enough yet for this to be effective
B0006TW71A|5|I am obsessed with sunscreen and have probably tried 20 different ones in the past few years. This is the best sunscreen I've ever used! It's an SPF 55, it doesn't cause my skin to breakout, it is waterproof/resistant, so it stays put when it's super hot out, and it is not greasy or oily, but dries with a relatively matte finish. Due to its high zinc oxide content, it works really well to keep the sun off my skin. I usually tan with most sunscreens, but not with this one! I Love it!
B003BGSMSM|5|excelente
B007ZN5ATQ|5|Love my new sonic.  It 's amazing how fresh my mouth and teeth feels after using.  This is my second one, the former one lasted almost 4 years.  Very pleased.  Best price ever from Amazon.com.
B006GQYSGO|3|Its convenient to use, but the razor is too weak and has a short span. I could invest in buying new ones, but too lazy to do that.
B00JKGBP0E|5|Love this night cream and use it regularly. Totall non-greasy...instantly absorbed.
B000E7YK5K|4|My women love it
B000GCOTH2|5|Excellent product
B000VTO05G|5|Perfect product for synthetic wigs
B0056AE8I4|5|I like the product
B00QH35M7U|5|I love this soap , I got sensitive  skin and the peppermint shower makes half the house smells fresh,  the tingle as well in a hot shower wakes you up and invigorates, and it's real soap
B0058RVR6G|5|My favorite lotion out of the collection I love it especially matching it with my spray I would definitely recommend and buy again :)
B005HYM584|5|I REALLY LIKE THIS WIG BUT I DO WISH IT WAS HANDTIED INSTEAD OF JUST A REGULAR WIG CAP.  THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE.
B00V2GFEC0|1|Very disappointed with product, after application my skin was extremely dry, showed more lines, after a few hours started flaking off.  Definitely will not buy again, sending back for full refund.  Seller did respond quickly for sale, hopefully will be just as good with return and refund.
B00J6PCGL6|5|I bought this for my mother in law for Mother's Day, tried it, and then bought several more for myself and girlfriends.  The smell is enchanting but not overpowering.
B001TH8Q72|5|Great product
B00LENWJTM|5|I love Crabtree & Evelyn Verbena!<br />The cream is fantastic and they now have perfume verbena too
B003SDD9WW|4|I love the product, love how it looks on my lips only down fall is if i try to re-apply it begins to clump up. Other than def. Recommended
B001A43ELC|5|I have been using this product for years. It's so convenient and once you get used to it, it's very easy to use. It's not messy and it doesn't require those little strips I can't find anywhere.<br />The only negative thing about this product is that the heating directions are a little off.
B001CSZTFK|5|I love my Oral-B Pulsonic toothbrush and Amazon was the only place I could find the replacement  brushes.
B001DYQELG|1|First shave today with DE Dorco razor and blades Felt like shaving with a dull pocket knife. I still have 129 blades I hope it gets better  Followup review I just read about hand strop your blades 2nd shave no drag on the blade Much better New rate of 3 stars plus
B00FRVUQZG|5|Exactly what my wife wanted. She wears this everyday. Very happy with this product. Will definitely be coming back to purchase more.
B001ET7EM8|5|I bought my wife a tube of this some time ago and she finally started using it.  Now it's a daily application for her.  Rub it on, it goes in and leaves her skin smooth.
B00DPIUVH6|5|Best tooth paste for someone who has a dry mouth, or is sensitive to other tooth paste.
B003J352NU|5|As Advertised & Shipped Quickly
B0029RUOTE|5|I used this before I shampoo and I absolutely love it. My hair feels amazing. I think I will use this for the rest of my life.
B00BQU2ZG0|5|This is a light and refreshing perfume spray, perfect in the summer. I wear Eternity Classic in the winter and switch in the spring to this..  I love them both and love to  switch up in the seasons.
B003I8KE2U|5|This product not only moisturizes but does an excellent job leaving the hair detangled.  Instantly moisturizes!  When other detanglers<br />do not work, you can count on this one!  Manage type 4 hair without a struggle.
B00FS2N3FE|5|Product is amazing, have used it since it was delivered and I'm definitely impressed. Seller had it at my door step in 3 business days. Love the product, it's so much more than expected and then some. Deep cleans and I already see and feel a difference!  Would definitely recommend to everyone!! Thanks so much!!
B006WVCF18|3|But not my really color..
B002PJ36FU|1|This is a fake product. The real HBO brand is Sex AND the City, not Sex IN the City. This product is NOT licensed by HBO, so you will be ripped off if you buy it.
B00JLSRLT0|5|I used this whole container of mango butter over the course of a few months in my cold process soaps and it worked beautifully!
B00JLPM8AK|5|I would absolutely recommend this product -- like many others, I have also used several different expensive lotions and creams with little or no visible results.  I'm in my 60's and almost immediately noticed a brightening of my skin with the use of Best C Serum.  The customer service and follow-up have also be exceptional -- I especially appreciate the follow-up emails with suggestions for application and use.  And best of all, Best C Serum is reasonably priced.  I will definitely purchase again!
B008KHRLKW|5|This toothbrush is very cool. It plays two of Lady Gaga's most popular songs. It certainly makes brushing your teeth more fun.
B001FB5OC2|5|works great, .use it to shave my head every two days. don't burn especially as much as the previous one i used.
B001E919LU|3|Its a great product for dark spots that are not too dark. The results take a while also. However, the price is great so again its ok.
B001QTW2FK|5|Very nice little hair dryer for the money. Good reviews are what sold me, and I wasn't disappointed.
B000ALFROS|4|This is a good product and always useful to have in your arsenal of hair care products- it works best for me on styled hair when applied to highlighted strands to add definition. It is also good when mixed with a little hairspray in the palm of your hand to give a soft control without giving that \\"fixed\\" look. I like the clean, non-chemical smell, too.<br />Word of warning- don't, like me, assume that because this is such a unique product, other Fekkai products are just as good. They are definitely NOT! I've tried the shampoos, conditioners, glaze, hairspray, styling creams, etc. and they are very ordinary. Because I can only buy Fekkai online as it's not available in Australia, I have spent a small fortune trying all products in the range and , apart from the Glossing Cream they are simply not worth considering. The only exception would be the pink conditioner ( Technician Care something or other?) which is ok if left on for an hour or so under a shower cap before rinsing. It will make your hair soft with that same lovely fresh smell but there are definitely better products out there.<br />So, all in all, try the Glossing Cream as it does give good results but save your money and don't bother with other Fekkai products.
B006D0PO3E|4|Don't really have any complaints, works better than other brands I have tried.  Works better if applied the night before.
B00W1WEVRI|5|An excellent shampoo, felt so clean and I love the scent of this.
B006490HZY|5|I love this product.<br />It stands up to it's name.<br />My entire houshold uses it.<br />I will continue buying it.
B00EWNOK5C|4|I bought this for the price (it was an add on).  I have actually gifted it to another so I can't attest to the fragrance or actual functionality of it at all.  All I can say is the price was great and the packaging was very attractive.  Sorry I can't say more.
B000QZ6JFO|5|works great for my 88 year old mom who is shrinking
B001V9FPHM|5|Love this salve, best there is and only get it through the Internet. Local drug stores don't carry it.
B002TR8Y96|1|I have fairly fine shoulder length hair.  First, I ordered the largest size and was surpirsed to find it smaller than expected, but that's on me. I just had to try to do smaller sections than normal. The first blowout went okay and I attributed the awkwardness & difficulty to the fact that I'm used to a larger brush. HOWEVER, I went to do a second blowout with this brush this morning only to find that the bristles are deformed! Apparently, the heat from my hairdryer melted them and they're all misshapen now. So, the brush catches and will not go through my hair.<br /><br />Basically, after one use, this brush is trash. Don't waste  your money. I'm very frustrated that I did.
B0018DAUKI|5|I love this sugar scrub, I use it everyday!
B00997YO52|2|Just OK, stick with the towel version.  The gloves just don't have enough mass to soak up all my wet hear. I find I am taking them off and turning them around so I can use both the front and the back. Too much trouble.
B002XQ1WYW|5|Wonderful.
B00BS1ARF8|5|I've used for years except now bottled in plastic. Lasts a long time. Seems like the same quality I remember from 5 yrs ago. I use it post shower/and apply to damp skin. Great for winter flakey skin
B0092D04MA|5|I love it!
B001ET7HJI|5|I've bought several of these and have given some as gifts. It blocks out the light well and is cushioned against my eyes. The only thing I don't like is the velcro strap curls slightly at the back of my head. Not a big deal but just thought I would mention it.
B00CFTEDYI|5|very good
B003TP2M9A|5|It has not even been a month and I can tell a BIG difference !!!
B005PHAVRA|5|Love!!!! this product!!! I found my soul mate...!!
B0030HNNS6|5|This is an incredible eye liner!!!   I must admit that I like my make-up to be perfect before I get out of the house which means I spend too much time in front of the mirror in the morning- however that is only because I have not found the perfect eye liner. I usually purchase rather expensive eye liners and then regrets it bitterly realizing the brands do not live up to the price or the promised long lasting effect. At the end of the day they smudge or like the waterproof gel eye liner from Smashbox they simply just dry up within a week of use all though I have taken all precaution to keep the lid closed.   This eye liner from Maybelline is inexpensive and live up to the promise of being long lasting. It glides on smoothly so it takes no time to put it on- and it stays on!! The brush that follows with the eye liner is okay as long as it is kept clean after use. I even put it on my lower eye lid and it still stays on!! It is a beautiful product and as long as Maybelline does not alter the product I will without a doubt keep on buying it!!! I wear lenses and is particular picky about my eye make-up but for me this is a great product.
B004PCRUJS|5|I absolutely loved Vampire.  I tried the little tester I found at a CVS and just about died from the realization...&#34;I have just found my perfect scent&#34;.  After looking on Amazon I realized that this is not a &#34;top tier&#34; perfume meaning it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for one small bottle.  However, I find this brand to be superior to most &#34;top tier&#34; perfumes.  Beautiful price, and it's the perfect match for me.
B001MKBBUA|5|LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!
B003XJZJCE|5|This is my favorite conditioner!  No residue buildup, and it works great in the winter to help control the dry frizz!
B003YP27UY|5|Goody must have discontinued this style of hair clip, because I've had a hard time finding them. So glad I ran across these.    In case it matters to anyone, rather than the faux-tortoise clip pictured under the black one, I got a copper-colored clip. Don't know whether that was just the luck of the draw or they only have black/copper sets.
B00A7I27QA|5|Nice product. I like the smell. My skin is not dry after washing face,  unlike many other cleanser.
B00NVBWG4S|5|Cute!
B0098JU8TC|3|I prefer to wash my hair every other day or else it gets very dry.  However, since I have fine hair, adding this product to my hair on the days I didn't wash it made my hair feel weighed down and a little greasy.  I tried to use as little as possible but it still felt wrong.  I gave the product to my mom to use and she is having better results, but she washes her hair every day.  My hair appears thicker when I use a spray in root lifter such as [[ASIN:B003USIB9Q Pantene Pro-V Fine Hair Style Spray Gel, Root Lifter, 5.7 oz.]] or [[ASIN:B006WVCCUW Garnier  Fructis Style Hi-Rise Lift Root Booster, Extreme Hold, 5.1 Fluid Ounce]].
B000OL8P2U|5|I've been using this for over a year. I love it. Regular toothpaste feels weird now. I will say this: I think it helps heal oral problems. I was in need of a root canal over a year ago. I waited due to insurance blah blah blah so I go to back to dentist a year later and was told that the tooth in question actually looked a lot better and will only need a deep filling. Now I'm not saying this did it but the only thing I've done differently in my oral health routine is use this and the rinse.
B00OU17KI0|4|Great for the price!
B000MN63CO|5|This replacement foil fits both my old BG2020 and new BG2028 just fine.<br /><br />I've bought several over of these folks during lifespan of my BG2020, but recently had the chance to compare the performance of the new (original) cutter foil that came with my BG2028, to this replacement foil which I had bought for the old BG2020.<br /><br />As others here have reported, the replacement is hands-down better than the original, clearly sharper and more effective at going through hair, with both foils being essentially new.<br /><br />The combination of Subscribe+Save and a recent coupon made the price very reasonable.  Recommended.
B004ISXUGQ|3|This is the only hair spray I have been using for a fairly long time. I am not sure about its role in protecting the hair but it gives it a sleek and shiny look which I like a lot. It does not stick to the hair but its smell as you apply heat to the hair makes the eyes burn a little bit. I do take care of my hair pretty well, so I am not sure whether this spray plays a role in protecting my hair from frizz-ness or the other measures that I take.
B00CHMWAY8|5|Great product!
B009PZZ70O|3|For the price, its long, shiny, I would say buy two at least,. one isn't enough. its good and Its nice and long.
B00HRMLE7W|2|It breaks fast, super fast.
B008BHX5F6|1|When I received my package, it was not the item that you see displayed in the picture!  That pissed me off because I was expecting the item in the picture and not a bottle half the size.  More like a travel size bottle, one you could carry in your pants or shirt pocket.
B008KEJ1LM|5|GREAT!!
B00CGWE83A|5|the spray is excellent, the smell is wonderful and you don't need too much to put on, and last all day well most of the day at least. highly recommended to all men. thanks
B0016BHMKS|4|I love the smell of mint so this product seemed perfect for me. You don't need to use much to get a good layer on your face. It dries quickly and leaves a refreshing minty smell afterwards. The only problem was it was a lot more drying than expected. I would suggest applying a lotion right after (even if you have oily skin like me) to avoid dry,flaking skin. Other than that, it has been great!
B004D2DQ6G|1|Did not like this product. Made no difference In my hair whatsoever.
B005C2O3PO|5|This concealer  does  the job perfectly  and  it doesn't  take much to completely  cover  whatever one needs on the face. I'll  be using  this as long  as I live  and or the product  survives.  My youthful  granddaughters  use it is how I learned  about  it.
B002FIW15W|5|Very good!
B0065O3H78|5|great great great evrythibg about it was just great smell moisture treatment left my skin very nice thank you arrived well packed
B00T2QJWH0|5|great hair! no smell and no nasty color in my water when I washed it. It has minimal shedding. The wefts were thick and the ends were smooth and full.
B00KECQ8BY|5|The Dr. Song remineralization gel does its job very well! After whitening my teeth they are normally very sensitive. However, I did an overnight remineralization and my teeth were sensitive no longer! The gel does not taste very good so try your best to not let it touch your tongue, but the gel does a very good job and I love it.<br /><br />You don't need very much for a treatment, maybe 1/2 a ml. So, even better it lasts a long time!
B000O7PKZY|4|Decent shampoo. Definitely pick up the conditioner to go along with it.
B00I2VX0OC|5|These tweezers are tight and work very well, even on small light hairs around the eyebrows.<br />I bought several pairs of them.
B000NKE95O|3|I know i'm not the first to complain about itch after showering with a Caress product, but I felt the need to let others know my situation, for the last few nights I've been showering with this, and i've been suffering daily itching all over my body....    So if you believe you have sensitive skin or allergies, I recommend you pass up this product, otherwise it is a great bodywash that smells nice and not too overpowering.
B008P7HQ2K|2|VERY drying, disappointed in results. Will not purchase again.
B0009OAH0U|5|I love this scent! I have always been satisfied ordering from here. I got my perfume in 6 days, it was wrapped exactly how I buy it from the store. The only difference is the amazing price! I would and have recommend to my friends and family. It smells great and I'm always getting compliments.
B00T0O7G8G|4|This Cosmetic Organizer is GREAT. It has all the spaces for a great makeup storage. What I love about this product is the fact that I have so many little lipgloss pieces and other single eye make up things that the storage is great for them. I used to put everything in my medicine cabinet and then it would all fall out and drive me bonkers. I am one that likes everything to be in one place so when I need it I have it. This is great for even storing your bottles of perfume. I find this fits on my dresser just right and everythings neat and organized and in one place. I totally love this organizer and storage. If you are one that has alot of makeup this is just right for you. I received this product in exchange for an honest unbiased review which is 100% my own and may differ from yours or others
B002D48QPM|5|Very good
B00KUHAYGI|5|Loooove this product! I saw a video in Chinese of a girl using this so it sparked my curiosity. My husband and I both used it and it worked amazing! Warning : shave or wax your face before hand if you're doing the whole thing. It will rip out the hair making it hurt.
B00V58MSMY|5|It sheds for the first 2-4 weeks as do any brushes, then it stops, like how all good quality brushes do. You'll occasionally get a bristle pulled out over time, especially if you don't have your brush properly hanging (if the bristled lay up against a surface that's not too good in the long run), but that's to be expected.<br /><br />In short:<br />Very nice size.<br />Fits in my hand.<br />The surface isn't slippery and is easy to grip.<br />Fits most brush/razor stands.<br />Easily lathers up my shaving puck(s) without brutally turning the top of my puck into mashed potatoes.<br />Very comfortable on my face and scalp.<br />Easy to clean.<br />Can hold a lot of lather so a few swirl in your shaving mug is all you need.<br /><br />What more could you ask for?
B00756HQNQ|5|Can't believe I almost didn't get this. Worth every penny a few times over
B003JM4OCG|5|This was a great concealer that lasted all day.  I also liked the smell.  I will re-purchase this.  When I'm in a hurry, I've even used this instead of my liquid foundation.  It's very easy to apply.
B0028P5SDO|4|I was a little worried about how small it was-- .28 fl oz. However, a tiny bit of this gives you great coverage. The product comes out super thick, like a paste. I let it sit on my finger for a moment to warm up. This makes it much more blendable and smooth. It gives great coverage, I wouldn't say perfect or flawless, but much better than most concealers-- especially in this price range.<br /><br />I have this product in Neutral Medium. At first I was thought it would be too dark, as I am very light skinned. The tone is just perfect though.<br /><br />My only grievance with the product is that after a few hours my mascara always smudges down on my under eye. I think perhaps because the product is a little oily, the mascara settles. I set it with powder but still get the smudge. I just remember to give the mirror a check after a few hours and wipe away any dark areas. Besides that, the product itself holds up well through the day.
B004M1BO3U|4|Purchased a toothbrush June 26th of 2015. The toothbrush was great until it stopped charging about a month ago. I would have given it a single star but I contacted Philips and they are sending me another handle with no questions asked so it gets 4.
B003BB0VMC|5|Very happy with purchase
B001A42R1A|5|These things are amazing! I sleep so much better and I only use one!
B00WB883QC|5|Great for dry skin
B005V22SEI|5|I love this bottle of lavender essential oil! It has a plastic thing on the bottle so that it comes out as drops and so that it doesn't pour out. Which I love! It's an excellent product and I use it for so many things! Definitely worth it!
B000FYVOJC|3|I bought it in 2009, very light use.  First thing, the included case is of very poor quality, attracts a ton of dust, and is not quite fitted for the product's shape.<br /><br />Second, it worked well I guess for a couple of years of very light use, but recently I have been noticing the speed of the motor is varying while in use  - it speeds up and then slows down - sounds like it is \\"dying\\" - I've replaced the battery, but have detected no change.  I feel it is rotating a bit slow mostly compared to when it was new.  I probably need to buy a replacement pretty soon.  Good thing the price has come down a bit.<br /><br />On final note, the idea is quite good - it worked well when it was new, not perfect, but alas, the quality is a let down.
B003YJAZZE|5|Been using this for a month and it is way better than my old 3 series. It's a bit loud so I can't use it early in the morning or it wakes everyone up, but the shave is close and doesn't irritate my skin.
B00CFZJN2Y|2|I received the Braun CoolTec Men's Shaving System from a program run by Braun. For a razor, the Braun CoolTec is quite fun to play with, when you consider all of its features. As far as being an actual shaver goes, though, it was incredibly disappointing.<br /><br />The razor was easy to setup, as the instructions explained the process reasonably well. The cooling bar feels nice against your face, but it didn't seem to do much by way of keeping my face from being irritated. I had a light beard at the time of shaving, which should be easily taken care of by a razor such as this one. Unfortunately, it just would not cut my hair at all. I tried every which way I could think of to get the razor to cut my beard, but, I just could not get it to shave it down at all. Fortunately the little trimmer on the back of the razor worked to trim my beard down a little bit. Sadly, it did not trim my sideburns down at all (to keep them neat), and I had to go back to my old razor to finish them.<br /><br />After trimming down my beard, I tried using the head of the razor again to trim my face. This time, it worked, and it cut the hair down. Cutting to the chase though, it did a pretty poor job, and I was very disappointed. I spent a VERY long time, once again trying shaving every which way I could think of (within reason), including dry (recommended in the manual), wet, up-strokes, down-strokes, sideways-strokes, etc., but I just could not get a good, even shave. I also noticed that the razor was a bit rough, as I cut my face a little, which really never happens to me while shaving, regardless of whether I use an electric razor or a manual razor. As I stated before, the cooling feature was neat, but it didn't really do much for me other than feel good in and of itself.<br /><br />The cleaning station was interesting, and I trust that it cleaned the head of the razor well since it uses an alcohol based solution for three minutes of cleansing. I was disappointed that the trimmer part could not also be cleaned, as that was the part of the razor that I probably got the most use out of, and was therefore the &#34;dirtiest,&#34; but there is no actual physical way for the cleaning station to clean the trimmer.<br /><br />In the manual, it mentions shaving every day when it talks about replacing parts. I would probably say that this razor best suits somebody who shaves every single day, as it seemed to struggle to do anything to even a light beard, and could not evenly trim very short hair. This razor should be, first and foremost, a device for shaving and, though the technology built into it (and around it, if you consider the cleaning station) is nice, it does not and cannot make up for its lack of a good shave for me personally.
B00NLKAVL4|5|Light, refreshing, cool,energizing to the skin. I have not found any of InstaNatural product not worthy to review and continue to use. I am glad that I was selected to review. You won't be sorry with any product.
B003DRDHG6|5|I love when my husban wear this Eau De toilette it drives me crazy. And the price was a great deal
B005H3ZOAG|5|I received the boot 2 days before it was initially. Due. Only thing is when you are it from the company just know that they have to order it so you won't get any tracking information for a couple days 2 at the max. When the boot arrived the packaging was clean and the boot was wrapped in a heavy duty clear plastic bag. I opened that up and i had a true to size medium boot. I wear size 10 in women's and i was a little afraid that the medium would be too small but it fit perfectly.
B00GMP38EC|5|FROM NOW ON I WILL ALWAYS BUY THIS WHAT A NICE SCENT ,AND MAKE MY SKIN FEEL LIKE A NEW BORN BABY!!! IM GLAD YOU SELL IT IN PKG OF 3 :)
B0070Z7Q8W|5|Gift for my daughter she loved it.
B00J2APD0G|5|The fusion proglide line is by far the best razor Ive ever used. I only use razors to shave my head but i do not doubt that i would experience the same comfort on my face. I couldnt distinguish a difference between the original fusion proglide and the the one i received with flexball technology. There were instances were i felt the razor did not line up to my preference with a stroke or two but overall i have no major complaints
B000KJRK2M|4|I really love using Monoi oil on my skin and hair. This product is very moisturizing and easily absorbs into the skin an hair.. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the smell. The smell reminds me of a perfume my great-grandma use to wear.
B001ET7FP4|4|I say surprisingly, because the spray itself doesn't have an overwhelming minty or otherwise taste, but it actually does seem to keep my breath fresh for at least a few hours.  I like the nozzle how it reaches the tonsils.  Really a great product, I just wish it was a little more affordable, and/or available in my local grocery store.  I had some trouble with tonsil stones, and it honestly cleared right up after using this.
B003ZW2M5Q|5|This polish is amazing, perfect for stamping and it's so pretty! I am really running out of this product already and will definitely buy more! Nice color.
B00B4MH4G6|3|I am using this product from past 3 weeks. I used normal rogaine first but it caused flakes in my scalp, so I switched to this with low alcohol, as alcohol is the main cause of scalp flakes. Now I find this good, i did not get any flakes after using this product and it has oils in it to moisturize your scalp and increase the absorption of minoxidil. There are very few minoxidil product with low alcohol for women, this is one among them. I would highly recommend using this product. I did not see any hair growth yet but as I said I started using from 2 months only, so in one more month results will be visible. One draw back is it causes your hair and scalp to be sticky, but if you wash your hair every day even with out shampoo, the stickiness goes away. I would highly recommend this product.
B008DKYM8K|5|Its soap, does the job not sure what else to say?
B007A2Z4VQ|5|Pur minerals is much better than bare minerals because the pressed powder doesn't get all over the place.  I also travel a lot and never had the press powder break.
B00PS9280I|5|Well it was a good product very soft and thick also very long i loved them
B0009OAIEU|5|excellent!!!
B002U32G66|3|This stuff is GREAT... until you take a shower.  I bought it hoping to get super dark relatively quick.  It worked great during my tanning session, and when I got home my husband was really impressed.  We went to dinner that night and my tan looked amazing with my neon pink shirt.  However, when I took a shower later that night, the color all washed away.  The smell is a little off-putting as well, a tad too masculine for my liking.  I think for now I'll stick with the good-smelling, cheaper lotions, and save the White to Black for \\"special occasion\\" tanning when I need to look super dark.
B000GIL12C|5|Perfect!
B00AZQLPNU|1|They watered it down! I opened it and it was ALL WATER. Not black at all!
B005YRD5PQ|5|We love this hand soap; it has a beautiful light scent and doesn't dry out your hands.  You won't be disappointed.
B00BOJDQ84|5|My wife loves this product
B0079R6BD2|5|So my family is one of those that just creates bald men. And that's ok. But it's not like I had a choice in the matter!!! Haha. So I noticed my hair getting thinner when it is grown out some and I'm only 23! What is that about? So I decided to try some hair remedies. My conclusion was that since my scalp is really dry and I have a tendency of dandruff, that's probably what is causing the hair loss. So on top of needing a shampoo to help my hair loss, I also needed it to moisturize and help the dandruff! Well I found the dynamic duo with this shampoo. My scalp feels better overall and I've noticed a healthier thickness since I started using this. I would recommend to someone who is in need!
B0050WKP4E|5|This stuff definitely works.  It doesn't dry immediately, but it definitely decreases dry time.  My nail used to remain moist for hours & I would need to be careful for a long time.  Now, 1 good hour of waiting...much easier.  A ceiling fan helps too.
B00893SY5S|3|It does protect my nail polish from chipping as any gel top coat would.... however, it's not as shiny as I expected.
B001E6VHUQ|4|Great value
B000VFWV4W|5|My grandmother loves this stuff. I personally have been trying to remove the toxic products out of my life.
B005ISURDO|5|Very powerful, clean even cut, a little heavy, but you get used to it. Top grade quality clipper. Nice long chord.
B0000Y3FRG|1|This product is misrepresented and counterfeit!!  I have the same product from my dermatologist and none of the ingredients are the same!! Burned me once and once only!!
9790798075|5|Love this cologne always been my favorite, can't find it anywhere else! PLEASE KEEP CARING IT!  My friend wore thiw brand & If you walked into a room you can tell I'm there!
B004V45JHU|5|Love this perfume, always get compliments on it when I wear it.  Wanted to get a new bottle of it, shopped at Amazon and got the best deal on it. Arrived promptly, well within quoted time.  Very pleased!
B001O1M6II|5|iv had hyperhydrolisis my wholr life, always hated hideing my arm pits or makeing sure i didnt sit close to people. on top of being very shy i figured no guy wud date me and if he liked me he wudnt after he saw and smelled my armpits, all summer and winter. used maxim for a good paranoid that i was still sweating year and then it stoped working, and wasnt supose to lol. been miserable for last 4 years first boy friend and all at 25, found this,stuff and the formula doesnt break down from the product touching your sweaty armpits. i love it hav my 1st bottle like 5 months remember to use it less.,i may get a tiny smell not offten but never sweaty arm pits
B00QFKZJZK|1|I'm still using it and I can't give results yet
B0058P6S2Q|5|this is a great cosmetic storage case.. it holds everything.. keeps me organized.. hubby calls it my tool box.
B000PI13SU|4|Our rental is on well water and has old copper pipes. I had to keep scrubbing blue green stains off the shower tiles and my skin was dry and itchy and my hair dull. I have had this filter for several weeks now. My skin immediately felt better. My husband also felt a difference immediately. The shower head has good pressure and several spray options. So far there are no green stains at all on the tiles. My one disappointment has been with my hair. It feels stickier after washing. I found if I use no or minimal conditioner it helps but it still is hard to comb through and feels weighed down. The color has improved though.
B00I5U1ARE|5|Let me start by saying I've used a few beauty sponges and know that the one raved about is the Beauty Blender, but there is no way I am paying $20 for a sponge!  NO WAY!  So I looked online for recommendations for a good dupe and found many Youtube makeup women say this one was almost better.  I think I would agree.  THE FLAT SIDE IS INGENIOUS!!  I use that on all of my face and the pointed end for around eyes.  It's perfect.  I bought mine at Ulta for $5.99 several weeks ago.  I was in there yesterday and they were sold out!  I will be picking up a few extras because of the price and I like to wash them often.  I've washed the one I have several times and it's still in great condition, but I still want extras!  It gives a better finish with bb creams and foundations than my fingers or a brush.
B001RVAATC|4|I had a difficult time getting the hang of putting them in because it opposite of how you put in normal combs.  But once I got them in they held tight and stayed in all day.  They are look nice and are well worth the money.
B00GMDIKV0|5|great powder and foundation brush
B0045M2T12|4|So i admit i was expecting it to be a bit more gold because of the photo so because of that i'll take 1 star off cause details could have been a bit more specific. However, it is super pretty and blingy, mostly golds and orange so it gives off a mostly gold shimmer but theres a bit of silver and green and blue mixed in too (but gold is the main color). It goes on smooth and drys quickly, doesnt clump up like alot of nail polishes with a 2nd layer! Great product:)
B004NHQ12M|5|This is a really good flat iron, it just glides through your hair and makes it shiny and smooth. Also the design is very pretty.
B0057X7SNW|2|Pretty disappointed, brings hardly any color on your lips!!! Will not buy thus line again.
B00JLAOP3S|5|I absolutely love this brush. I use it daily with my Mac Face and Body foundation. It gives a flawless look.
B006FYTKNI|5|Ibd has previously proved they have great products. I LOVE this color!! Have gotten so many compliments in this purple
B003S56J4K|5|This straightener works very well. This makes my hair so straight and smooth. My hair is normally wavy and frizzy, so this has been a great help. I love the digital temperature setting also. Overall, I couldn't have asked for more.
B000OIBRZ0|5|I love using this every day. It protects my face from adult acne and helps reduce it. I would recommend this seller and the product to anyone looking for this kind of facial treatment.
B007UCBXF2|5|I had problems with severe prickly heat and no matter what I tried failed. I saw this powder and figured I had nothing to lose. What I had to lose was the prickly heat. I now use it all the time and haven't had any problems since. I would recommend it to one and all.
B00CG2LGL2|4|This product was a perfect new decals I have been looking for my collection.<br />It is perfect in size, not too big not too small and it is has great quality for the price.<br />This product is perfect for beginners as well as advanced nail technicians and I would definitely recommend.<br />I will definitely be buying from the seller again.
B00SF102LS|5|Very good
B00RPCDUO4|4|This is a great box. I was so glad to find it on Amazon!! I thought I missed out on this one last July.<br /><br />My box contained:<br />Butter London Nail Polish in The Old Bill (Full Size)<br />Laura Mercier Matte Radiance Baked Powder in Highlighter 01<br />L'Oreal Paris Extraordinaire by Colour Riche Liquid Lipcolor in Ruby Opera (Red) (Full Size)<br />Maison Francis Kurkdjian Paris Aqua Universalis Eau de Toilette (Perfume Sample)<br />Fekkai PrX Reparatives Intense Fortifying Masque<br /><br />Great value!!
B0090QJ8HQ|5|It makes my hair shine and it is not oily. It really smells good. Hair looks great.
B00008BFXJ|5|This was my first electric toothbrush and after only two weeks of using it coffee stains are gone and my teeth are getting whiter every day.  The Quad-Pacer (or whatever it is called) is a must and makes brushing your teeth much more consistent.<br /><br />Charger stand has a small foot print and the tooth brush already lasted a 3 day weekend at the ski hill without the charger.  Highly recommended.
B00BC0KXCW|5|i just love it!<br />My hair is so shiny and it looks amazing!!! :D i used to have dry hair and i was always looking for new products until my sister recomended me this shampoo and conditioner. You better try them ;D
B005BEF5EQ|5|My favorite product. I can't do my hair without it! I like all Kenra products.
B0052EDNWG|5|It is working great I will order again. I will love it more if I can get some discount or coupons to go with it.  But other them that product is great
B001PAXHK4|5|I can't make a comparison to what the originals were like since I never tried them  but these are awesome. I have had breast reconstruction and on one side the nipple is larger and somewhat puckered so it shows thru some clothing even when I wear a padded bra. I was self-conscientious and wanted something to camouflage just the one side.  I've been wearing the same Nippie every day for about 2 weeks now and it is holding up very well.  It is so easy to apply and virtually invisible under clothing.  You can't feel in on you and I've slept in mine a couple of times. Wonderful!  I am so thankful I found this product.
B0084PXVX6|5|Worth the price, exactly 5 lbs. Ivory creamy lite smell.  Received in a box the shea butter in plastic bag enclosed in another plastic bag. Very please!
B00B60GA6G|5|If you are concerned on the widely used aluminum anti perspirant, try this great product as it stops odor and doesn't create problems by blocking your toxins release.<br /><br />Update 19 August 2013<br />After buying several products from Deodomom, I like how they send my deodorant personalised with my name.<br /><br />My wife started using this as her TOMS gave her broken skin, and this deodorant was gentle and it works. I will continue to purchase this product.
B001428SE8|1|This product doesn't do much to relieve itching or to moisturize skin, even when used with the creme of the same name.  I wouldn't stop using Derma-E products though.
B001UDGO60|4|The Biolage Age Rejuvenating Conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable. It is wonderful and I'll buy more if I can find it.
B002D4J3VI|3|Ok so I have to say this works REALLY well for me as far as my nails not shipping. The low rating was because I couldn't peel it off to save my life!  I tried for 5 minutes on each nail and I had a good 3 coats of this stuff on. My nails didn't ship for a week though. Haha. Sephora sells or over for glitter polish in a black pump dispenser bottle. That got the glitter off!
B003FL3UNA|5|This eyeliner is the best. I use it to put in my water line, not on the top of my eyes. But it goes on so smooth and you just have to stroke once to get full color. Other eyeliners that i've tried I have to go over top of it multiple times because it is so light. loveeeee it
B00CCUFFOC|5|I just tried the product and enjoyed it very much. I would follow their directions to the letter and you will get great results. You can actually smell the grapefruit extract. I paid for another well known product that you buy from these well known dept stores, (Dillards, Macy etc) for 75$ and they were good but this product is just as good with pretty much the same ingredients for a very reasonable price. .
B001MKG4XY|5|This buy was great and what a huge saving from buying them elsewhere. . . . . . . .
B00AVP37G8|4|Beautiful colors! One coat coverage. Make sure you use a base coat or the colors will stain your nails.
B00AIP0UR0|4|These aren't as resin-free sticking adhesives as the name brand patches, however I do like the bright colors and the blackening part of the patches. I think those are good benefits.
B00LLMB3W0|4|worked very well however by the end of the day you get lots of little fibers all over your face.
B005VEDSJU|3|It is OK.  Haven't really noticed any significant results from its use though.
B000VHYLFW|5|Most eye masks are either too tight against your eyes, or they let light in around the bridge of your nose. Not this one! The beads conform to the contours of your face, effectively blocking out all light. It has the added bonus that you can toss it in the freezer if you need to cool your eyes. Particularly useful for those of us who suffer from eye irritation due to allergies. I absolutely love this thing!
B004JGKT6G|5|Love this flat iron glides through my hair without pulling any of my hair
B000GLRREU|5|I love this!  I've recently added a Water-Pik Ultra to my oral hygiene regimen, and I really love the results.  My mouth feels great ALL the time. While I also switched to an Oral B 9400 electric toothbrush ([[ASIN:B000A7W5DI Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush]])I feel that the Water-Pik makes a significant contribution to the improvement in how my gums feel and I won't ever be without either of these tools again.
B001330XFA|4|The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I haven't worked out how to use the brush to get voluminous hair. My very long hair dried perfectly however in 20 mins from really wet.  Great buy. I got compliments the next day from everyone.
B000O5UWTA|5|I have very dark black Asian hair and got some blonde highlights for the first time.  I was worried about my highlights turning brassy so I researched ways on avoiding that, and discovered that I needed to use &#34;purple&#34; shampoo.  I reviewed various purple shampoos here on Amazon and on different hairstylists' websites as well, and decided on this product after the consistent recommendations.  I have used it for several weeks now, and my highlights look shinier and lighter.  I wash my hair a lot, and use this product after using my regular shampoo (I read that the purple shampoos are not really for &#34;washing&#34; your hair to get clean), then condition.  For the price I paid here on Amazon, it is so well worth it.  You don't need a lot, and it smells good, too.  Note:  I notice that when I tried using just this shampoo, it does not lather well, but if i use it after shampooing my hair with a regular shampoo, then this one lathers a lot.
B00336EUTK|1|This product is only good is you have perfect straight teeth. I would recommend the &#34;5 Minute Bleach Whitening Gel&#34;. You get a lot more for a lot less money and it works on crooked teeth.
B00U8AOYAY|5|I was stunned when I received the packet of 10 Cosmetic Brushes. I was pleased with the aesthetic beauty of the product, and also by the 'feel' of it. Once I was satisfied, decided to invite a second opinion, so I discussed the set with a person who is a expert in make-up. She very thoroughly examined the set, brush by brush, and then together we tested their feel as well as their quality. After a detailed examination we came to o the following conclusions:<br /><br />**** The product is as good as the seller says that it is<br />**** All kinds of brushes that a person needs are included<br />**** Some brushes are made of synthetic fibers<br />**** Some are made of natural fibers<br />**** The selection of the fiber has been done carefully<br /><br />As a result,<br /><br />**** The brushes are very gentle to human skin<br />**** Make-up applied by the brushes give an even coat<br />**** Make-up removed by the brushes remove them evenly<br />**** It is easy to clean and maintain the brushes<br /><br />I found that the set is ideal both of use as well as a presentation item!!
B005UZLDTM|5|This oil is amazing.  No chemicals or parabens, just wonderfully smooth and moisturizer skin!  It's worth every penny and lasts forever because you don't need a lot.
B000P22UUG|5|On my 4th bottle of this perfume. I am constantly asked what scent it is and that it smells wonderful!
B0009F3O8Q|5|I have always had problems with dry skin, and I now work a job where my hands get dirty and wet frequently throughout the day. It can be agony. Palmers is, hands-down the best thing ever. Putting it on is instantly relieving. It absorbs quickly, is never sticky, smells great and is like no other lotion I've ever tried, regardless of price.
B00FK05IQG|4|good
B000C1VX9O|5|One of the best and unique gucci fragrances. A real classy flowery smell, not so many people really use it, unlike those highly advertised perfumes from their flowery line. If you wanna smell different, it's a good option
B00BL9DQ3W|5|good for waxing..
B0091SWB04|5|I was given a sample of this by a representative of the company at my local TARGET store.  It helped my dry eyelids to return to normal in less than a week.  I ordered this product from Amazon and am also using the day cream, night cream and serum.  Good stuff!  I first saw it recommended on the Dr. Oz TV show.
B0002RYHTQ|3|they arrived in same pkg as boots so they werent noticed under all the package material. theyneeded more obvious packing so i could see them on the very bottom of the box. I just thought to look more closely today and there they were in. clear bag the same size as the gloves. i hope they stretch and soften after they r washed. But i found them so Alls well that ends well. The 3 stars r for the lack of packaging.
B0085E6OC6|5|I love witch hazel!  I use on my face, and on my dogs skin
B000NW4OIE|5|I use this product religiously under my nail polish on my own nails.  It makes my nails stronger and helps to grow faster.  The product was just as described and the price was great.  Delivery time was fast and efficient.
B004XNEH9U|5|Real thick product, sticky but does define curls and waves. smells good also
B00JAHMU9I|5|This product is amazing<br />Powder is put a little water<br />Then moods<br />And apply it on my face<br />And wait for 10 _20 minutes<br />Dry<br />Remove one piece<br />No staining or mess<br />Given glasses to face whitening<br />I loved it too and I'm going to buy it again
B00N1AG5IM|3|I love Mrs. Meyer's cleaning products, but this one smells--and not in a good way. Normally, their products smell excellent. However, this one smells a lot more chemical-y and not as nice after using it. I'd almost rather just use the all purpose one on my bathroom and shower. However, it does the job.
B004JZIVBC|5|Love this parfum!
B001T8MSZ2|5|works great!
B003JKFEL8|5|ty
B0069VYSFM|4|This product delivered as promised and did exactly what I was hoping.  I was impressed enough to purchase three more to give as gifts.  Definitely helps extend the life of whatever product you are trying to stretch. The size is perfect to enter tiny bottles and the odd design ensures every last drop is extracted. I recommend it!
B000FS05VG|5|Dryer is very efficient at drying hair quickly. Hair is much more manageable than with other dryers that my wife has used.
B00GWBR5N6|5|its very very very nice and its perfect
B000JFRFCW|5|About a year ago I started getting flakes on my scalp around my crown and neck area and had no clue what to do to fix it.  I tried Neutrogena T-Gel (which was awful) and a few other over the counter products, all to no avail.  I considered going to my dermatologist for a prescription lotion like a girlfriend of mine has, but it was really expensive and there was always the potential that it wouldn't work.  A co-worker of mine recommended this to me a few months ago and I've been flake free ever since.  This might not work for everyone, particularly people with severe psoriasis or dandruff.  Mine wasn't too bad though, and this product really did wonders for my scalp.  Try it.... it's cheap and really, what do you have to lose?
B004K4LL0A|5|I have tried then all and spent a fortune in the process. Cabot Labs Vitamin E eye cream and Intensive Moisture Creme are effective without being heavy. I will never go back to spending a lot more for inferior products.My skin looks great.
B000H3I480|5|[[ASIN:B000H3I480 Ultima II CHR Gentle Toner, Double Action with Collagen for Dry Skin, 7.85 fl oz (232 ml)]]  I have been using this product for 30 years and love it.  I use it after a shower on my face and it releaves that tight dry feeling. I am glad I can buy this product on line since it is impossible to find it in the stores.
B00BD3R9JI|5|Very good product my make up lasts longer
B003QYFVRY|5|The toothbrush works fine. Uncertain though on how to use my coupon because I don't have a printer. Will check deeper into the matter
B00J0GCYIQ|5|There are many good reasons for choosing a sulfate free shampoo : sulfates are related to cancer, sulfates dry out hair and cause color treated hair to not hold the color as long as well as increase frizz.  Knowing all of these made me very happy to receive this shampoo in exchange for my review. I noticed the first time I used it my hair felt cleaner. It has a cool minty smell that embraces the deep clean provided by using this shampoo.
B000XDXENO|5|very old and very nice soft scent
B00FBVFQFW|5|I can't live without this stuff!  It is fabulous and is so healthy for your hair!  A lot of other mousses leave your hair sticky and dry.  This is like an extra vitamin treatment with volume.  Awesome!
B00M1WYYWK|5|Great bristle texture for keeping your beard in style and brushing through beard oil.
B0026938DY|2|I buy these for my mother's hearing aids and she said they do not last as long as the other same brand batteries.  Wondering if bad batch or maybe a knock off product..
B00H4HHQ2M|5|Love this lavender oil.  I add it to my eco laundry detergent or put a few drops in my detergent  dispenser of my washer!  Love the way the clothes smell and it also keeps my hE washer odors gone too!
B00466BAKI|4|It was a good product. Very useful for me. only complaint was that I wish it was packaged better.I paid 6ish dollars in shipping and it had a few dents on it because it was poorly packaged and shipped in an envelope. Overall my product is great though!
B0042QEFEK|4|Useful for carrying cosmetics or my chargers, earphones, Bluetooth when not in use, convenient for all those small things you don't want to get lost or tangled in your purse surfing the day.
B007VB50LU|4|I love this groomer but I misplaced all the accessories, I'm better off buying another one, the replacement parts are ridiculously priced but the uniut does what it states and does it well
B003JN4RGS|5|MADE HAIR LOOK FANTASTIC!!!!
B0017U06ZG|5|Good price for the scent. This particular scent and brand is much more expensive at Albertsons. Glad to have a six pack that will last a while.
B004KQFBUE|1|I made an error on quanity and the company never responded to my request to return two cases.  This was for a mission trip to Honduras and money for this is tight.
B000E1CMWE|4|Too soon to say it works but at least my hair stopped falling out.
B00NPW16QW|5|This is a great UV Light. It is the perfect size to fit one hand at a time and it has a timer that goes off when finished
B00983N5C0|1|This is my fourth assessment, was rejected by the ruthless three times before. Cause I don't want to say too much, you can see for yourself, the following pictures is that I got the perfume Because I bought the perfume is fake，I don't know why I did not upload photos, it makes me very disappointed
B00755JD56|5|I already love Benefit Cosmetics, so this was just a great idea! It was a a sure way for me to venture into new types of products, but without being completely clueless. I used it for homecoming and got so many compliments.
B004OUK4X0|4|This Product is Great. I truly enjoy usingi it. I would buy again. This is a product that I would suggest to others.
B002Q4UC1K|2|I have always liked the Aura Cacia product line so I thought that I would try their shower tablets after seeing them in the store. You are suppose to unwrap them and place them on the shower floor and allow the shower water run over the tablets and allow it to bring the aromatherapy scent into the air. If you have a cold or flu, I would recommend using all 3 of them to get the effect that you will probably want because it is not very strong scent.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- I think these would work ok if you had a cold, if you used 3 of them.<br />- They do take a while to dissolve, but the fragrance goes away quickly.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The eucalyptus fragrance is not very strong compared to their other products.<br />- The fragrance does not last very long. It lasted around 4 minutes in the shower without it being in the direct flow of water. The tablet lasted around 7 minutes.<br /><br />OVERALL: I will not be purchasing these again, I will be searching for another brand as I was not fully satisfied with the Aura Cacia Shower Tablets.
B00B1TKY8C|4|I am relatively new to wet shaving having switched from cartridge razors and canned soap to a DE Razor and Wet Shaving Soap/Cream about 3 months ago. This brush is so much better than the boars hair brush I originally used. It is much softer, lathers the soap better and loses far less hairs (actually very few hairs in total). Although I cannot compare it to an &#34;expensive&#34; Badger Brush, I am very satisfied with my experience thus far. And, it’s hard to beat the price. I hope this brush lasts a long time. I would recommend it.<br />By the way, although the proper way to store/let dry a shaving brush is by hanging it upside down; I have found that by rinsing out the excess soap, then squeezing out the excess water between thumb and forefinger, shaking it dry and then rapidly &#34;swatting&#34; the bristles back and forth against my other hand, the brush is pretty well dry before I place it back in my medicine cabinet.
B00AOUCN1K|5|Best color. Looks better with every wash and two months later I'm still getting multiple compliments every day
B001HKR6WM|5|I would buy ELF products with my eyes closed! I trust their brand and I am so happy that they are vegan and animal friendly and their prices, oh their prices, thanks to the Gods for ELF &#60;3 NEVER CHANGE, ELF!
B000UVZU1S|5|Have not used it long enough to know how good it is.
B00K5L4VEA|5|BEAUTIFUL COLOR!!!  Thank you!
B002DNAQHO|5|Perfect!!!
B008T85MU8|4|I bought this product becuase I needed something cheap that does the job. I am new at making designs. Well, I bought this at sucha great price and they are just as good as the more expensive ones. I totally recommend this product!
B000OIBUZW|5|I've used this for years; it's the most effective product I've found for exfoliation and moisturizing. My pedicurist is always amazed by my nice, soft feet.
B0012XO2W6|5|Love it! Does not feel too thick on my skin and coverage seems to work well. Dont be surprised that its a tinted cream, appears clear once its used on your skin
B008XN4JQC|5|LAST A YEAR GREAT FOR WRINKLES ,CLEAR SKIN AND FIGHTS ACNE AND GETS RID OF SKIN MITES THATS ON 50% OF PEOPLE.AND NO HARSH CHEMICALS
B00C02Z7HC|5|Product was shipped fast and arrived intact. Great razor.
B00CF2UZRY|1|I boutght this product because I was looking for a good less expensive waterproof mascara that didn't run when sweating.  This product works however I noticed that each time I washed it off my eyelashes would fall out several at a time.<br /><br />I went back to my regular estee lauder mascara (which runs) and removed it the same way without losing any lashes so it must be this product.
B00019A97E|5|I have always had dry skin and I used everything I could find. I have been using this lotion for about 2 years or more now and I won't use anything else.  I thought they sent me the wrong thing when I ordered it cause it is a liquid and I wasn't so sure about it, but after a couple of times using it, I loved it!  I only have to apply it once a day and even my massage therapist noticed a huge difference and that my skin wasn't dry and flaky anymore.   This product is worth the money, especially cause I buy it directly from porters.com and get the biggest bottle for around $40 and it lasts me about 5-6 months.
B00S4U0WYW|5|I was going to buy one of the more expensive steam curl- but this came out on the Amazon - so I thought I would try it. I received it ahead of estimated arrival date.This really works. All I need is to set the time and give some press. Fair price by the way.
B0001M1IJY|5|Shipping was expensive but thanks alot......
B003ZW5JJC|3|It's a good moisturizer but I saw no change with any firming. I would be skeptical of the picture.
B000GCURBO|5|yea it work for me
B001C26IH4|2|The mask does what it is supposed to and keeps out light and is nice and soft with two different materials to choose from to put over your eyes.  The only problem is that is stinks really bad!  It came smelling like a mixture of burnt plastic and diesel.  I have washed it several times and nothing has taken the smell away.  I'm glad it was cheap because I can't use it smelling that way.
B00KYZA8DA|4|I have used self molding trays for whitening products but this tray is much thicker and since I purchased it for teeth grinding, I do feel it will work well for that.  Basically any type of tray you have in your mouth is going to be somewhat uncomfortable.  I have worn it 2 nights and did ok with it.  The key is to get it to fit perfectly.  There is a YouTube video on how to fit the tray which I would suggest.  It gives you some tips and suggestions.  Just search by the product name and it will come up.
B001E77NS0|2|Not a bad moisturizing soap but I'm sooo disappointed and feel mislead. We bought this package of 6 containers thinking that this was the same beautiful almond scented soap that has the same name as the original product. This new product lacks the beautiful almond scent that the previous product had. Now we're stuck using up the 6 containers that came in this order. I'm hoping to load up on the original product if I can still find some online. The original had such a beautiful scent and seemed to have a smoother texture too. Did they really think no one would notice or care about them changing the product?
B000XP4I3C|5|Been using these for years. PRICE on Amazon was outstanding.
B00A6OTXOO|5|It realy is a great product
B00BB17Y1K|5|Just what I wanted - works great!
B002RT7BH2|5|Works great at stopping water from draining on floor
B0010AZ3TM|5|It was amazing, within a week my mole was gone.  The instructions were simple and the results are very satisfying.  I will use it again.
B005JRGIDC|5|Washes fresh and rinses regardless of how soft or hard the rinse water.
B001DKVBOK|5|This lighted mirror made for a happy wife. It has the usual magnification but also a more powerful insert. The lighting is quite adequate but, at the same time, gentle. When our old one died, and I could not find a replacement bulb, I found this treasure.
B0007X74GS|5|My hairstylist got me using this as a leave-in conditioner on damp hair after shampooing and using my regular conditioner. I have very fine hair; a spray or two on the ends is all I need and it really makes my hair softer, easier to style and comb or brush. I use it every time I wash my hair; it's not too heavy if you just use a little. I started using it years ago before I colored my hair just for how it made my hair style better; now it is a bonus that it helps my color last longer!
B005LB0HSI|5|This is a lovely, mild cleanser and it really smells great! Not too perfume-y so can be used by anyone. Shipment was fast.
B002L5WFT6|4|These razors work well and were a good price.  I have discovered that as you get older, you really need a razor that swivels, but these do a pretty good job.
B004232R9S|5|PERFECT TRAVEL SIZE
B005V4ZO0G|5|Love it's rich fragrance.
B0090UJFYI|4|Dries fast, not greasy.
B004SO2SVI|3|I am not sure if it's working or not. Maybe I am using it wrong or I am just at the wrong place. I partnered it with lacoste noir which was a strong cologne a couple of times. I put a small amount on my neck and wrist. The only place I go to meet women is the gym. I see several beautiful women there. Majority have boyfriends or husbands. If I see a ring, I pass and move on.  The difficult part is approaching them. I am just an average guy, but slim. I'm getting to be toned a bit. My specialty is core and balance.  Not a lot of guys can do that. Most of them just hit the weights and stay there.  They do have a lot of muscles though.<br /><br />I would say I am not really lucky with women.  And I am hoping this will give me the opportunity for them to initiate the conversation instead of me all the time. Most of the time I wave my hand a little to catch their attention. They normally respond.  It is always like that. I always initiate the conversation.  And often, I don't get any real interest from them.  Note that I'm a wide reader so I can have a smart and fun conversation at all times.  I sense if they are interested or not based on their responses.  I will still see. This time, I am just going to wear it by itself without any cologne. And I might try to be closer to the girl so she can smell me. Maybe that's the trick.  If not, I will try to go to the arts museum.  The last time I went there, I saw a lot of beautiful women.  Women are always attracted to art.  Guys just hang there to look for girls. So, my approach will probably be to stand next to the lady looking at the art and ask for her honest opinion about it. We'll see.
B000052ZB7|5|I have very sensitive skin.  I have for years been on a search for a facial moisturizer that is not greasy, not heavy, but yet did a good job of moisturizing my skin.  I typically tended to use creams because I had found they did a better job of moisturizing.  But they tended to be too heavy and sometimes greasy.<br />This lotion does not irritate my sensitive skin.  It is very light weight - a little goes a long way.  Yet even just a slight amount moisturizes better than many creams I have used.<br />I have been very happy with this product.
B004Y6NVFM|5|Works pretty well in about six weeks
B000KKRFDA|5|I can't believe the ridiculous price I pay and lengths I'll go to keep myself in Glowtion.  Why oh why did Revlon stop making the best make up ever?  Even tho I prefer the light-medium shade, light was the only one available.  I was able to add a lot of it to some old medium that I still had and  now it's perfect.  Periodically I'll be checking to see if another bottle turns up somewhere and am sorry that when I was in Canada last Sept. I didn't check out some of the stores there- I understand it's available out of the U.S.
B0009PVV4K|5|I got the 2 inch model, and it goes to 395 heat. I switched over to this one from a one inch Remington I found at walmart for like twenty bucks, so I'll do a quick comparison.  The Remington took me about 45 minutes to get all of my hair straight, and was only ceramic coated. It wasn't nearly hot enough for good straight hair, and turned my bathroom into a volcano.  The conair is the most amazing flat iron I have ever owned. Gets all my wavy and curly hair pin straight in about ten minutes. and the hair doesn't frizz up or poof out and being to curl later. I live in Florida, so there is high humdity, and my hair stays perfect all day. Definitely pleased with this. I really like the swivel cord at the end. When I turn the straightener, the cord doesn't turn with it to get all tangled and twisted.  It even came with a carrying pouch. Awesome purchase.
B00APEFE6G|5|great product!!! fast shipping- great price - thank you!
B00ODP4NNI|5|love them and are easy to use
B006SVCY6I|2|the brushes are really rough and they fall apart pretty fast. it was cheep but you get what you pay for with this.
B0041P9J8Y|5|I've been wanting to try Wen for a long time so when this Fig version came on sale (love Fig!) and had a little extra funds, I ordered in high hopes.  Was Not Disapointed. The fig scent is only really obvious to you went in the shower, so guys....you can use this too.  Actually only can only slighty scent it when someone else has used it when you're up close (like getting/giving hugs).
B00L5O22W4|5|Love it a lot!
B004VTWA1I|5|Makes me feel clean.  I don't worry about athlete's foot or jock itch when using this tea tree oil soap.
B00LAT4WZE|5|I'm a 45 year old woman and a smoker and I've got wrinkles that I've been try to get rid of. So when I got the chance to try this at a discount price for my honest and unbiased opinion. I had to try it and let me tell you for one the simple instructions makes it easy. Plus it mad my face soft and alot cleaner and after just a few days I can see the wrinkles getting better. I would recommend this toveveryone
B0067ETBJE|5|Love this product! Have written reviews before, but don't mind doing it again! The best chap stick in the world! I hope they never discontinue making it!
B000EOR49W|5|Great  product! It really works. Rub it on the area that works  and will  have  relief  in minutes. Try it.
B002WJHL4K|2|I've purchased this before from a gift store and the hand wash is supposed to be clear-no color and the wonderful fragrance is so long lasting on your hands. The one purchased from Amazon was yellowish and although it was the same scent it was much weaker and really didn't last long. Perhaps it had been sitting on a shelf exposed to sunlight too long. I gave a bottle as a gift also. Had I known the difference beforehand I would not have purchased it. The Thymes products are heavenly but I'd recommend purchasing them from a store to be sure you are getting a fresh product.
B0036ZA40W|4|To me it seems much softer than other brushes I have tried and much easier on the gums, I would buy this product again.
B009PZGYJM|3|yeah, it's not real hair. it's black but it's ok because my hair is jet black... but this gets tangled a lot :o
B003XPXIHQ|5|The best masque in the market..
B00013YYS0|5|Unfortunately for me, (but great for Burt's Bees), I have the worst nails and cuticles I have ever seen.  My cuticles grow faster than my nails, they get constant hangnails, are extremely dry and crack.  I was going to get a manicure to try to strengthen my nails and I didn't want to listen to the lectures from the tech about my nails and cuticles, so I bought a tin of Burt's lemon cuticle cream the day before my appointment.  24 hours later, it was as if there had been a miracle!  My manicurist couldn't believe how good they looked (and in only ONE DAY!). It has been about a week now and I am so proud of how my hands look for the first time in years!  I encourage everyone with horrible cuticles and nails to give this a try.  Having the manicure is also helping my nails grow.
B006QO4C1W|5|Works great and does what it was made for.  Haveing the two minutes gives me time to relax and enjoy my time better.
B002WTCK0U|1|I've always used Plackers, but ran out and this was the only item in store.  What a piece of junk.  The floss shreds right after the first tooth.  My teeth are by no means too close together, yet the floss gets stuck and I have to literally yank to get it out.  Never buying this particular product, better yet, this brand, again.
B001BIOPO2|5|I purchased the Herstyler shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask after I used my sister's Herstyler shampoo and hair mask which she paid FULL PRICE.  I am an African American female with THICK and long natural hair and the Herstyler products leave my hair soft, shiny, and moisturized!  I am really impressed by the products and the smell is magnificent!!!  I have gotten sooooooo many compliments on the look, smell, and healthiness of my hair.  I am now a true fan!!!
B0085RZKRI|4|finally got these to replace the aging Brush i had, and was instantly reminded of when i first bought my Sonicare Toothbrush.  i should probably follow their recommended replacement cycle... or at least something close to it.
B003BMI9DE|5|Love finding favorite colors!
B000RBDDFQ|5|This stuff is great.  It holds my hair in place without leaving as hard of a residue as many other hair clays.  highly recommended
B00ARF44O6|1|This is too expensive. I returned few trimmers which I bought from Amazon. I felt like they were not worth and not maintaining the quality of the brand and also too rough while trimming. And the product which I bought now doesn't look better than those two trimmers which I returned earlier. Now, I am bored of returning the products.I want to return this too but I am in dilemma whether returning it or not because the package was torn. Even though it was torn I decided to send it back now. I am looking for the good trimmer where I can trim my beard and sometimes hair too. Please  suggest me the best suitable trimmer.Cost doesn't matter.
B00D31WWQS|5|I've had problems with allergic reactions to many deodorants, but Dial is one I can definitely use! Works all day, thank goodness, and it doesn't have the &#34;smell&#34; that many deodorants have.
B008WG7X8Q|5|this is a great product. its a bit hard when you get it but if the container sits in a warm room, it soften up the shea butter.  i would recommend this product.
B00RDN9I3M|5|Perfect replacement for my Mia... couldn't be happier to get double the product for half the price.
B00J4J2QIM|5|Great brush! After being to the hairdresser and having her use a similar type brush I looked for one online. I have long hair and tangles after watching my hair. I've noticed this brush pulls much less and glides more easily thru tangles. Now I'm ordering one for my mom.
B000GG7NU8|5|This is going to sound crazy, but I use this in my little girl's hair to moisturize it.  She's almost 2 and has dry, red hair that is prone to breakage, so it just wouldn't grow.  We started using Queen Helene's cocoa butter stick twice a day on her face (she has dry skin as well), and once a day in her hair (before bed) and both her dry skin and hair saw a tremendous improvement, and her hair is even getting longer now that it isn't breaking off.  You do have to roll the stick in your hands a little bit to warm it up so that you can apply it, and for the hair I use the product that has &#34;melted&#34; onto my hands so as not to put too much in and make it greasy.<br /><br />I don't love that it doesn't come in a twist-up package, as my little girl loves to steal the whole stick and run around with it, thus melting it a bit in her hands.. but it works so well that I hardly care.  I definitely recommend this product!
B0038TVH3Y|5|All my life I searched for a descent hair product. I finally found it with Shea Moisture's Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Now my curls pop instead of just a big ball of frizz on top of my head. Also, my hair is softer and silkier to the touch. This is an excellent product. My hair is naturally a mess of thick kinky frizzy tight curls. Now those curls are more defined and much smoother. I highly recommend this product applied to wet hair.  Work it through the hair. I usually then use a big comb to get knots out. It is also great if I don't have time to do all that to just pull my curls out a bit on my dry high hair for a bit of a messier natural look.
B0046BV86O|5|This is a great color.  I initially got it to match one of my wedding colors (Guava) and then lost the bottle.  I liked it so much that I ordered this one.  I wish they still sold it in stores.
B001KYQ2KW|5|Walgreens no longer carries it....love it...even more expensive products look orange on my fair olive skin tone.
B0009VQ8J2|1|I bought this based on all of the reviews that say how great this stuff is and better yet, how wonderful it is for the money.  I have been using this cream for about a week and a half and my arms and chest where I have applied it are covered in a red rash.  I do admit I have sensitive skin but have used tons of other lotions, creams, etc. and they have never done this.  I bought 4 jars of this stuff but I will never use it again.  Sorry for the negative review but I am just being completely honest.
B001DHNBYQ|5|great
B00CP7BYPG|3|Pros: gets the job done, softens and adds a great shine to your face mane. Love the packaging.<br /><br />Cons: doesn't go as far as I would like...a larger size would be welcome, seems as though it really stiffens up in the cold, feels like I put gel in my beard if I'm working outdoors after application.
B007BLN17K|5|I like how small the brushes come, I do a lot of detail work, so this is awesome to have. Hard to clean though.
B00SKQFT4I|4|This is a really nice hair dryer, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that its a little heavy for me.  It dries nicely and very quiet compared to any other dryers I have had.  I will definitely keep it, I can use the workout.
B003V3476G|4|okay
B000FED5DU|4|This works okay but if you don't use a guard be prepared to bleed a little.  The battery is pretty good and I rarely charge it.
B005CE21YW|5|Love these rollers
B00JEMRAOY|5|I love the whole line of Andalou Naturals 1000 Roses collection and use most of it.  The exfoliator is gentle but works great and your skin feels well hydrated after using it.  It helps your moisturizer and foundation absorb even better.  I have extremely sensitive and dry skin and this is the first line of skin care products I have found that doesn't irritate my skin.  It's a keeper!
B0049WV3LU|5|I purchase for my granddaughter. I wasn't sure about the size so I purchased 2 different sizes. She loves them both
B0014P8L9W|5|I love this product so much!! I found it accidental on Aamazon and I freaking love it!! the positive reviews are right. this stuff rocks
B00LZWV0WY|5|This is a lovely cream which absorbs deeply into the skin.  It has a definite softening effect to the face, but I'm over 60 and need a little more moisture than most, so it didn't work as a facial moisturizer.  It works brilliantly for me as a body cream and I'm having great success with it for a few persistent eczema patches  LOVE the fresh natural scent.  Great product, price and producer!
B001BODNYO|3|I bought these for my husband after many disappointing encounters with battery powered trimmers. We have not yet used the Larger hair clippers. I decided to purchase the Andis after reading reviews saying this way the brand of choice among men. My husband did say the blades  are very nice and very sharp but the motor seems under powered. he feels that as soon as the blades start to loose their edge they will start to catch and he will most likely look at a different brand.
B00HMUDJXG|3|Not as immediate results as you would think
B00005A441|5|Like the others say, the clips are tricky.  However, I've gotten them to consistently work for me, once I practiced with them a few times.  My only complaint is that I wish there was a spot somewhere in the base to store them.  I'm a curler novice and I've only used them a few times, but have been very happy with the results.  The rollers are just the right size (I have fairly thick hair down a few inches past my shoulders) and I love the texture on the rollers that keeps my hair from slipping off.   The rollers heat up quickly and were easy to use, even for someone who didn't really know what she was doing.  Watching youtube \\"how to\\" videos helped a lot.
B00355SHG6|5|I am deployed and i needed something to restore my hair fromthe damage of the hard water and this works wonders. besides it smells so good! my hair is softer and the shedding is decreasing..
B00B7MCI6E|5|Hard time finding this hairspray.  I have used Mink for years.
B00FS2N32M|5|I love these but I grabbed the wrong color by mistake
B00IEU8TT2|5|I use it for blush. LOVE the size.
B007OAKA4U|5|Excellent Results! My mother loved it. Fine and oil hair. She needed to wash her hair every day and use blow dry. Her hair was damaged.<br />With this shampoo and conditoner , she washes her hair every two days and her hair still keep the shine and better, no oil. She loved the combo kerastase (shampoo, conditioner and serum)
B0085M2VHU|1|THis broke my out in hives and made my skin peel it was SOO  NASTY !! you should not get this
B00937VAQE|5|Excellent al around soap and shampoo
B00H2CGWH4|4|I actually really liked this. The package itself is a little bigger than anticipated but it still small enough to fit neatly into my purse and backpack. All the products work great! Only one that can use a little adaptation is the tweezers and only because the end is a little sharp that if not plucked correctly the tweezers just cut my eyebrow as if they were scissors. But once you get the hang of that it is a great product! Recommend! :)
B00455X8M8|4|Pros: Love this product. Gives great relief to know that it is organic. Very satisfied with the purchase. will never go back to any other eyeliner ever.<br />Cons : Needs sharpening quite often. so i am almost at the end of finishing this product.<br />will definitely but it again and again. Happy i found this product.
B00AN9CJDO|5|This peptide serum is working wonder's evening out my skin tone, I was skeptical but my skin has visibly improved. I can also  wear it daily under light make up.
B003CTU27W|4|After the first use of this toothpaste my mouth felt as if I had just come from the dentist.  I could not believe how clean it felt for most of the day.  I found myself just running my tongue  on the inside of my mouth.  Three weeks later it still feels super clean after brushing and I have gotten used to the clove aftertaste.  I have an issue with receding gums so I will have to see if helps to reverse it.  It is definitely worth trying if you have dental issues.
B001ET7ACW|5|If you don't know it yet, you should do research on the neurotoxins that are in most hair care products.  Go to ewg.org to see how your products measure up.  The Alba gel is very easy to apply, holds up well over the course of a day and best of all, no neurotoxins!
B00021DVF8|5|I have used the bareMinerals makeup for 2 years and am very satisfied with it.  It goes on easily and wears well throughout the day.
B0084HCIHY|5|This raw Shea Butter is easy to apply on skin.  I love it!!!
B00E3ENU9M|5|I purchased this for my elderly Mother. She has trouble combing her hair in the back due to some issues with her arms and shoulders. The extra long comb has helped her tremendously.
B00DPE9EQO|1|Unfortunately I don't have a glowing review about this product. I haven't noticed any change in the appearance of my skin. The one good thing I can say is that it didn't break me out.
B009M8FB3M|5|This is the best brow bar I have ever tried I have been using this everyday since I got it in the mail. This is a must have for your make up collection!
B000K71QJW|5|Great product!
B000VCW3HK|1|...and it's priced like the real thing.  I purchased the knock-off (a cheap imitation of the real product) from another vendor not realizing that the product was sub-standard.  The container was different and the fragrance doesn't last.  However, there were no misleading claims about this product.  Then I found and purchased what I thought was the original product at more than twice the price and received exactly the same product as the knock-off purchase.  This vendor promised no knock-offs and the display shows the original manufacturer's container and name (Lagerfeld).  Truly false advertising and pricing.
B00E4YN7L2|5|Thanks
B001ECQ7G4|5|Cleared my razor bumps right up! The only thing is it took a long time to and it dried out my skin, but other than that, it does exactly as described!
B0087P9PB0|4|I've had this starter kit for almost a year now. I love the gel nails, and if done properly they really can last 2 weeks! I use mine on my toes as well and it's lasts twice as long! If you get this just remember it does take more time than a regular paint job, just because there is alot of steps and then curing with the lamp in between.  What I have noticed is that the more times I use my lamp, the longer it takes for it to cure my nails...maybe it's just mine.
B00GY2B6D8|2|Dove/Unilver tests their products on animals.  Most notably, they test on Beagle dogs.  Go ahead and do the research and see the gruesome photographs that are out there.  If you send Dove an email complaining about their animal testing, they will respond with a long-winded message that explains that they test on animals because of government regulations, etc., and they are &#34;committed&#34; to end testing on animals, yet they still do it.<br /><br />Everyone gets the same email, year after year.<br /><br />The antiperspirant Deodorant works and smells good.  Probably not to Beagles, though.<br /><br />Boycott this one and go for companies that do not test on animals.
B004UIZFQW|5|Nice selection of blades for a newby to safety razors. Good price good service.
B001U0ONNY|2|I use this product couple days, I feel my face very dry and red. The I just stop use this product
B000B8YY3K|5|This is literally my favorite thing ever. For months I was trying to find a fine glitter to throw on my nail designs. Time and time again, I have used loose glitter and RUINED my nail designs because it's just too thick!!! This product is AWESOME!!! The perfect top coat of glitter! I do a lot of gradients, and I love to throw this stuff right on! It's blends my gradient better and puts such a gorgeous layer of fine glitter to dazzle my design up!
B0050K5QR2|5|Beautiful product
B0017LXT9K|4|The Ferrari scents are subtle however mildly strong if that makes any sense to you. My complaint is not with the product but whomever is responsible for packing and shipping. There IS a difference between the Ferrari scents and the Scuderia Ferrari. I specifically order Ferrari and 60% of the time receive Scuderia. My advice is to order the Ferrari and check on it after the order is received and before shipped (obviously).
B000BJ1CGQ|5|All I can say is GO BUY THIS!<br />I have tried all different methods of in home hair removal, Im 40 years old and have done it all.<br />I am so happy to have FINALLY found something that works! The pink creme wax that comes with this kit is a dream, I used it under arms, bikini, face, legs. It is FABULOUS!
B00564TEQG|5|I have a very sensitive, somewhat oily scalp, seborrheic dermatitis, and am allergic to sulfates.  For the past several years, I've been looking for a shampoo that I can use as often as I want without irritation.  I've tried pine tar, coal tar, Head & Shoulders anti-itch & sensitive skin; I tried products my hairdresser or my dermatologist recommended, slathered my head with a tea tree oil mixture before shampooing, and was almost ready to get the hair shaved off in desperation. Finally, this is the one!  It has resolved the itchiness and large flakes from the seborrheic dermatitis and leaves my curly/wavy hair soft, shiny and conditioned (no small feat for someone over 50).  I usually wash every other day, but sometimes need a daily wash because of swimming or exercising.  No problem.  Expect the low suds you would get with any sulfate-free shampoo.  I use a small squirt of a Pura D'Or conditioner on the ends after washing to keep frizzing to a minimum. The price was a little daunting (especially for an experiment) at first, but I will buy it again without hesitation.  For me, it truly is pure gold; eliminating that persistent itch and irritation has really improved my quality of life.
B004BD0YQW|1|This mascara clumps up when you use it and I have to use another mascara along with it to make it look good.
B00N3DH65I|1|Haven't noticed any change in my skin :(
B00MPDXHOG|5|great shaver
B006LFZTWC|4|Fast shipping, great lashes for the price!
B007ZXR4I6|3|The first time I used this,I was really impressed,but as I use,it more and more,am deciding that it is pretty much like all the other flat irons out there. It doesn't tug at my hair,and slides through easily,but doesn't really give me the smooth sleek finish that I was hoping for and burns my bangs just like all the others,no matter what products I use or what heat setting I have it on. I am disappointed in the product for the cost
B005M2ZVCS|5|I really, really, want Johnson and Johnson to put this product back on the market<br />so I can buy it. I know several others who want this and the lotion and the powder<br />with the relaxing lavendar and chamolie in it.<br />It is the only thing that helps my 88 year old Mom's pain and helps her to rest.<br />Please, she is on coumadin and unable to use most medication for rest. Please,<br />market this product.<br />Sincerely,<br />Debra
B001G5HZCY|5|Best shave ever my husband claims
B000E7SSI0|5|Excellent product.
B00CP4H3T0|5|I bought this for my teenage son. It's perfect!  He loves the flip up trimmer for keeping his stuble in check. Works great!
B001KYW2LA|4|Great price for the amount you get.
B0002MQ9GK|5|OEM part operates as expected.
B0094BQJPG|4|The color wasn't exactly as I had hoped. It came out more cotton candy sorta faded pink. Which of course is disappointing , I've used Pravana many times and have never had this result before. Maybe it was just this particular shade. As with all the others though it doesn't fade Which is wonderful.
B003YJ70NY|5|Don't let the critics steer you away from this razor.  The packaging and graphics look like cheap junk from a discount store, but Feather blades are awesome.  The company dominates the medical/surgical market, so they know how to make sharp and dependable blades.  They just don't comprehend our association of that labeling art style with inferior product.<br />The razor has a plastic handle, but so what?  It's a tool for shaving, not a prized heirloom to show off and brag about.  It is lightweight, but to me that's a plus, giving better control around the chin and adam's apple.<br />Alignment is good, blade fits perfectly on the metal center rib.  Blade exposure is perfect for shaving. The critics who claim it isn't enough for a close shave want a straight razor, not a safety razor., The mechanism is smooth and secure.  The top opens by twisting the metal ring at the top of the handle, so it won't loosen up by accident while shaving, but still opens easily to rinse or change blades. Cheaper than disposables, shaves better, and doesn't clog up like multi-blades.<br />I'll quit shaving before I go back to twin blades or disposables.
B001LF4I8I|4|We tried this on a family member who sometimes uses an iron costing several times as much as this Remington.  As such, I was ready for some heavily critical comments but in reality in turned out well:<br /><br />- Attractive compact unit.  This makes it easy to store away for those with tight bathroom space.  The compact size makes for a lighter unit; good for girls with weak arms so they don't have to get muscle-pains the next day in their arms compared to heavy units.<br /><br />- Digital control.  No old fashioned dial switch here.  Instead, a dead-on temperature precise modern digital unit.<br /><br />- Heats up quickly.  Got up to operating temperature quicker than more expensive units. Might have to do with the smaller heat plates.<br /><br />- The touted vitamin E with avocado oil is gimmicky.  Fact is, doesn't seem to matter.  Hair came out looking a little on the dry side.  This in turn means you need to be careful about making the passes so you don't damage the hair.  Maybe more of an issue with those who have drier hair to begin with.<br /><br />Overall, the unit does work and its price is hard to pass up.  Will make a fine gift for yourself or for someone special.
B001EM1BBK|4|These brushes are super soft and I love that they are eco-friendly. Unlike a lot of makeup brushes that are really stiff and irritate my skin these feel amazing.
B003D7L948|5|Bought for my mom she likes the size to carry with her in purse keeps larger ones at home<br />I great product she's very happy with it<br />She loved getting the 12 pack!
B006FYTKNI|5|great.. very pretty color!!!
B00AFAX4QW|5|Nice
B00FU8BC54|4|I liked it, but you'll need to hang it. it tangles easily.
B00456T4UM|5|Great product my wife loves it
B002S8VFHE|4|I liked it, I have olive skin and it worked well for me, I would not use it for darker tones or too light. Used it on my sister and it looked awful, but give it a try and I guess its all up to your skin if it blends in well with it. It does stay in long and it worked good for me.
B008LB614E|5|I usually pay a lot more for this product.  As far as I can tell it is the same thing.  I just finished my previous bottle and will be trying this soon.  It should be the same.  Came sealed.
B00GWBYAWK|3|I bought fullips a couple months ago and have been using it most days. It plumps my lips up but only last 5 minutes. A little disappointing.
B0009OAHIW|5|I bought this product for my mother for mothers day because I love the smell and this was the best deal I could find.
B003YF2HHM|1|there is nowhere near the amount of Lipshine needed to fulfill the amount of lip ink color in the bottle without the lip shine the lips look dry and crackely Wes not pleased for the price had to buy additional bottle of shine too expensive for what u get
B00QG3FEIS|5|If you're looking for something to cover up a bunch of flaws on your face, this isn't the product for you, but if you're looking for light coverage this is perfect.  I really hate wearing foundation, it makes my face hot & itchy.  This is the first that I've been able to wear, even on a hot day.  It provides just enough coverage to blend in any spots on my face, while still looking natural.  It also would make an excellent primer for those of you that don't mind a thick coating of foundation.  I have hyper-sensitive skin, and I can use this just fine, so although it has its flaws, I really love it.
B00AJXQEX0|5|This bolster offers support for knees, legs, and back. It is comfortable and durable. It is also very easy to clean. It is on of those things that you might not know you need. Once you use it, you will wonder how you survived without it.
B00538TSMU|5|Fantastic! I will be ordering more:)
B000TBTJOS|5|Since this soap is originally for black women, I have trouble finding it in my hometown.  I've used it for years and love it so I went to the internet to find it.  Just a really good soap that is not drying but doesn't. make your face greasy.
B00GBL0A6G|5|This stuff works great if you use as directed. You need to let it stay on your head for five minutes. This is the only prescription or non prescription product that has helped. I've had Oracea, plain old doxycycline, every medicated shampoo made. For me, this stuff is controlling the problem my dermatologist said that I would just have to live with.
B001AJ6YS2|5|I'll never spend big bucks on a shaver again.  This unit works great. Have had it now several years.
B0010LG7NW|1|I bought this because I couldn't shake down my peak flow meter (round hole) and this one could be pushed down with a finger.<br /><br />However, I can't get this meter to go over a certain reading.  It is always the same or close 250-300.  I cannot fit my mouth securely around this type of hole, and I figure there is air leaking around it because of that.<br /><br />So,<br />I went back to my hard to shake down meter - spouse has to shake it down for me - in order to get a reading that shows what I consider a reading that is more accurate - IOW, it varies, but not extremely so.<br /><br />I would not buy this again, nor recommend it.  What to do with it?  Who knows.
B004M1BO3U|5|My previous Sonicare died and I ordered this to replace it. It works well and my dentist says I have less tartar that has to be cleaned off. I would recommend it without reservation.
B004X36RBQ|5|Nice pop of color. Hold hair in place too
B001TP0A8M|4|This is a very nice felt tip eyeliner. The line goes on smoothly and evenly. The only drawback is that the tip seems to become dryer after using a short time.
B004Y9M4DE|4|decided to try a new mascara and gave this a shot...very happy with it. will buy again
B000A3AEO4|5|This  bottle of Pleasures was a gift for my brother.  He was very happy to receive this because his current bottle was almost empty.<br /><br />I ordered this less than a week before Christmas knowing it was scheduled to arrive after Christmas.  I was very surprised when it was delivered before Christmas. Great service!
B005KC1O1M|3|Good product, bad packaging.  At least 1/2 of the bottle leaked out before it arrived.  Otherwise, it was a good product.
B000HF4PE0|5|As expected.
B008XWU372|2|It doesn't work as well as Miracle Skin Transformer
B00HRGBSYW|5|I love the smell!!!!  During the winter months I have very dry skin (winter itch) I add this to my bath or right after showering and problem solved. I would definitely purchase again.
B00SCQVRQK|5|The Beautyfullness makeup application sponges are pretty darn awesome. I enjoy that they are shaped like a teardrop making them ergonomically beneficial. Others are hard to hold b/c they are so skinny, but these from Beautyfullness fit right in my hand and are easy to hold.<br /><br />I have been using mine with my foundation, and they really do a good job of helping me apply. I'm very picky about the types of sponges that I use, but these are anti-microbial -- and I appreciate that!<br /><br />I would recommend these makeup sponges for help with applying your concealer or foundation evenly and easily.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a 100% honest review.
B002C7487U|5|Great night moisterizer
B00P9RAFEU|2|I received this for review and i couldnt get past the smell. I never got it to my face because the smell was so strong.
B002VWK99W|5|I used HT sunless years and years ago. When they stopped making it, I called the company to complain. I just realized it is back on the market. LOVE LOVE this product. Easy to apply, moisturizes, and no streaks!  Please don't discontinue it again. Totally awesome, as is the rest of your products!!
B00EA5B5S2|5|This stuff is amazing and it's the perfect purple. I use the top coat with my OPI and Essie Polishes and it lasts at least a week.
B003XJ81FG|5|love it
B00KWV768G|5|Good quality
B00FFTOIE0|4|I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter at Christmas for just a couple of bucks.  Good price, good quality for the price and even though the colors of the butterfly are a little tacky being multi-colored instead of all the same, it's still a great piece.
B0038TN5KW|3|hummm ok i guess
B000RZPVV6|5|Great carrier oil for aromatherapy blends.
B003UKM9CO|5|good deal for the price. the model 1000 is worth the value compared to the 3000 or 5000.  bought this before for someone else and no complaints.
B00K19CYVI|5|fixed all the cracks on my fingers and relieves the dryness.Ilove it
B005YB42EA|1|I've been totally scammed!! I've written a ton of reviews on Amazon...& this is the first time I've rated any product with 1 star. This was an absolute waste of money & total rip-off!!!! Never had any issues with Ed Hardy till now. The scent literally lasts for about a minute....I believe this a bottle of tap water with a few drops of perfume in it. I truly do!!! Do not buy here!!
B0040I44N2|5|I really love the la-jay.just like my own hair.
B00KF9WSTC|2|This item the rubber bands look big like regular clip size which was what I thought when I ordered it but they are actually very small. My hair is very thick and I can't use these
B009BPOQXW|5|This travel iron is the perfect size to throw in my purse on those humid and rainy days.  It's also great when traveling and don't want to pack a lot of stuff.
B001J6O0HI|5|completely compatible with my system. comes in a nice sealed container. new ones simply snap into place could not be easier.
B00NX9A140|5|I love this and after using it only 2 weeks can see a difference in my skin tone. I use St Ives cream with this as it also restores healthy skin. I use the Clensure SNOWY 3x a day while watching tv or reading on my kindle. I love that it has 3 dials to set for what you want to use. I plan on taking it with me when I travel as it is light to carry. It really has helped tone up my skin as I use it on my hands, arms, throat and face. I noticed my skin tone is much better just after 2 weeks can't wait to see how well my skin tone is in 6 months. I find it a very good buy and love using it for tonning my skin up.
B006N0BM62|1|Awful!!
B000C1ZFFW|3|Smells differently from the original scent that I remember so well.
B00BE2OKXQ|5|Good quality and very cheap. The color and length are pretty cool. You can use it longer than you expect.
B00DDMIXJC|5|Smells wonderful and works well.
B004CHF8AY|5|This is  a nice change of appearance for me.  The color is about what my natural hair was before I aged.  And the styling is current
B0013NBW5A|5|Just what I expected and it arrived quickly.
B0087TVKXW|5|Great conditioner, leaves hair soft & shinny
B0094DH1RE|5|Such a great product for the price... Well worth it!  I am extremely happy with them and plan on buying again
B004L96O4W|5|I absolutely love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and my hair has never felt so healthy and soft!
B003AYEUZY|5|Have used this product for many years.  Local health store no longer carries it so I was surprised to find it on Amazon.  It was actually much less expensive than online than it had been in store when it was available.
B0018A33BY|2|It doesn't really show when I wear it so I feel like I wasted my money..
B00HS0NZJI|5|If you like the sting/tingle and you're not allergic to bee stings, this is the best lip plumper I've ever used. But be warned, if you kiss someone on the lips, if even a peck, they will tingle too!
B0087PWWT2|5|This is a great lite holding spray yet it set your hair in place, but yet you still have body and movement without the stiff and stickey feeling of a super hold.This is a great spray.
B002AYM52A|5|I've been an incense lover and something of a connoisseur for 30 plus years.  There's been some wonderful scents and incense companies over the years, but many of them are gone now for whatever reasons.  For the readily available brands these days Auroshikha is probably my overall favorite in terms of quality - and this quality assortment is a screaming deal!<br /><br />Another review mentioned this collection is about a 20% discount from buying the packs individually.  Huh?  The packs go for about $3 each on Amazon, yet they're just over half as much if you buy them as a collection.  PLUS you get the incense holder (cheap but actually one of the most functional stick incense holders I've owned) a scented candle (haven't tried it yet) and a very cool bamboo mat type pouch to store all these packs in (very convenient).<br /><br />As for the scents they tend their largely floral which is what I prefer (never a big fan of the woody scents).  So far I've tried the Amber (love it), Orange Flower (very very nice), Musk (scrumptious), Rose (excellent rose), Rosemary (burning now and it's very nice),  Frankincense (amazing - my new favorite) and finally Orchid (the only one I haven't cared for so far).<br /><br />I still have plenty left but I'm ordering another pack while it's still available on Amazon.  If you're an incense lover don't hesitate!
B004GZJOHU|5|I always received my product as promised. This is a very good light coverage for wearing alone or over foundation. I would recommend.
B000301ZF6|4|Excellent product for sun coverage.
B002R23DQM|4|Great pencil! But I did not get the one I ordered. I do love cabaret but received burgundy. Luckily I do like the color I received, hopefully I can still get the one I originally ordered though.
B0052V5CGY|5|This lotion is great for cold winter weather. It's almost scent free, and for such a heavy duty moisturizer it's surprisingly light. It's not greasy and absorbs very quickly. Unlike most lotions, this advises you to apply to dry skin (not after a shower or bath).<br />I like it a lot & will continue to use it.
B003RFA4QA|4|it's an ok cream . I compared it with Aveeno, and this last one was better, but still do the work
B00CBN6M7E|4|It was the style I wanted but doesn't work as well as I,d like, No fault of the seller, as it was new. But I will use it.
B001ET76AI|5|Keeps my mouth fresh for hours and hours. It doesn't dry my throat too.
B001CYCWNG|4|Silver has healing effects (for those not otherwise allergic, of course). SilverSept offers an aqueous gel compound containing natural silver, excellent for wounds from surgery or other procedures, to help them heal better, healthier, and more efficiently.
B001VEK1LW|5|Works great. My old razor feels like new.
B002UUIOMY|5|I've been using the twist-up stick for years, and prefer it to other hand lotions. I put some on my hands every night and I never get a hangnail anymore! Its great for a hand-quilter because it won't harm the fabric and washes out completely.
B00I5H5Z1O|5|I love this razor. I does the job.Basically this product works. It's useful because it's compact. Since it is compact you can take it everywhere with you. I know this because I have a small purse unlike my sister's which have these huge designer bags. I personally don't like to take everything with me like my sisters do. I only put important things in my purse such as this small portable razor. I basically need this now. Especially when I'm invited to special events. This product is like a life saver. Like literally if you miss a hair you can just reach in your purse and pull out your razor and shave but you need to add water though. Since you need water I now also carry a small miniature water bottle with me too. Wow, I guess that when you are in need of in an emergency you will also have to carry other stuff to go along with it. Either way I think think if this product never came out I would of kept my beach towel on.
B003V264WW|3|I liked this dryer a lot, and it was a great dryer for the price.  However, a month after the warranty expired it started shooting out green sparks and losing heat.  Probably won't bother with this brand again, as I see the same thing has happended to other users.
B00304XY24|1|I finally received the package from my shipping company today and noticed that the box on the outside was discoloured in certain areas and when I uncovered the box I discovered that all the shower gel had leaked out into the box and about half of the lotion have leaked out as well. The product is dry in the box and packaging which indicates that this did not occur in transit. The package should have been inspected before it was shipped. This was purchased as a gift for someone but I am ashamed to give it in this condition,
B00ARZ5BOI|4|Product works well. I can now use both of my hands to comb and style my hair on the back of my head.  I look forward to using it to trim my own hair when it needs it.  I would have liked a larger mirror but overall I am happy with the product.
B00AKKAR9O|4|I like it. it's so moisturizing.<br />not for oily skin.<br />didn't need to use my regular sunblock or face moisturizer .<br />this is for someone who is really busy and just want a semi coverage.
B00KQ06EPE|5|Love it
B00819JPMG|5|Unique design with triangular tip, quick way to get believable brows.  Grey/brown is a good color. Will repurchase.
B0006NZKAG|5|this is my daughter's favorite fragrance so I purchased this product for her ; it was a  special birthday gift
B000V1DJBU|1|Commodity use period is too short.It will expire in half a year.The emulsion texture is too thick,and color is too white.
B00639DLV2|4|Hawaiian Tropic has always been a favorite brand of mine. The lotion is smooth, not greasy and not runny. It's perfect for the beach or for a day working outside. The lotion smells amazing. Just the fragrance brings me right to the beach! I love the new bottle and the swirled design of the packaging/product. It's a must have for any beach bag!
B005V2UHIW|5|Great product! I put a few drops on my pillows and it worked as \\"aroma therapy\\" beautifully! It can be diluted in water and sprayed around the house in order to create a fresh environment. I also ordered the Lavender oil, I had bought this in Europe a few years ago, but now we have it in the U.S.
9533223510|5|I decided to purchase this product. I read the other reviews. And it seemed like everyone loved it. So I thought I'd give it a try. Best decision I ever made thus far. I love this thing. I'm addicted to the scent. And when I run out, I panic. And I'm always running out. Because I use it non stop. I just can't help myself. lol :)
B000A3V1QO|5|I love this product. Takes the hair off easily and has the perfect shapes. This product did not make me break out at all. I am very satisfied with this.
B00912CL5K|5|I gave this as a present for my mom, whom she loves clips like this style. She really loved it. Personally I didnt like the back part of the clip, but my mom said it holds on better than the new clips. Thats the only reason im giving it 5 stars.
B00PVGG1HO|5|Very pleasantly surprised by this polish! I just bought my third color. I have read articles about all the harmful chemicals in a lot of polishes. First they came out with 3-free, then 5-free and now this 7-free is the latest and best as far as safety concerns. I was concerned at taking so much out, would it apply and stay on as well as regular polish? The answer is it does! On my toes the polish went for 4 weeks with no chipping. I was amazed. I finally got a little chip on the 5th week, which they needed to be repainted anyway due to nails growing. Thanks Pacifica for a great product! Love the quality as well as color selection!
B000W12XA2|2|I didn't find this product to meet any of the expectations which the company leads you to believe will occur.  (Typical of the Skin Care Product Industry, which seems to be absolutely un-regulated.  Skip it!
B005YWBOHW|4|wife loved it --a bit pricey--but nice---if you want reviews don't make people write more than they wish---two more words required!!!
B00KMXQZC2|5|I like the smell of this and its not gressy!!
B0051AZBMQ|3|A bit too oily for me, as I have to be careful getting out of the tub and making sure the tub is not oily for the next person. Won't buy again.
B0016O92XU|1|Have used this 3 times now. The first time around it made my hair feel kind of dry / coarse, with super straight ends (it doesn't normally have those). It added no shine and, if anything, removed rather a lot of volume. My hair looked flat and dull the very next morning. So I decided to help BIG along. The second time, I used conditioner afterwards. Same thing. The third time, I used a mask which I leave in for about 45 minutes before washing, and have been really happy with to date (lots of shine). A single wash with Big undid the benefits I usually get from the mask. Same old same old - dry-ish, unimpressive looking hair which looked even worse the next day. It was clean and stayed that way for a few days but it looked so dull I had to braid it. My hair is normal - neither dry nor oily. It's not too fine or too hard, and has always been easy to please. My verdict - if your hair answers that description too, don't spend money on BIG, even if it does smell like, what's the name... Lily of the valley.
B000NPWQU4|2|Smells horrible, and streaks way too easily.
B001AZVRII|5|A friend recommend this and now I'm hooked on it. It leaves my skin feeling smooth without being greasy. I have oily skin and I feel this helps cut down on my mid-day blotting. It also smells really nice.
B0014X712W|5|Everything A ok.
B00Q7NHKKC|3|This item isn't worth the price but the Escada has nice fragrances. If you can find it somewhere else for less.
B010NJSMWK|5|Love them. Great!!
B000H724ZK|5|My friend loves this lipstick and wears it all the time so I got it for her for her bday and she was excited.
B00B5OTQVY|5|This is a hard to find fragrance and is really very nice. It's clean and fresh and I love when my husband wears it.
B00GOYH4PA|5|Thank you
B00H93NJLS|5|Wonderful oil.  Makes your hair and skin feel great.
B00Q3HN7RM|4|Feel great on the face. I use it after derma rolling and it seems to really soothe. I lay down and read until it dries and use the serum remaining in the packet on my neck.
B0034KYDQ0|1|I was so excited until I opened it and there were a lot of broken colors. buy at your own risk.
B000PTIM88|5|Found the best price here. I've been using Almay loose powder for years. Love it!
B000V2ACH8|5|This stuff works wonders on my thick hair. Strong enough to hold for an entire day. Probably the best product I've used in a long time. It's a bit pricey, but totally worth it!
B00WNGH08O|5|The hairbrush arrived a day earlier than anticipated which is always a plus . The packaging was minimal so it fit nicely in my key mailbox.<br />After trying it out I must say, this hairbrush is unlike any other I've used. I have very long hair and brushing my hair is always a chore so I was surprised at the ease of passing the bristles over my hair( it almost feels as if it's only penetrating the surface - not too worry though, it's working!) I have sensitive follicles as well- it always hurts to brush my hair and this brush is so gentle on my poor scalp . No tugging sensation at the roots AT ALL as I brush through the length!! My hair is in a fragile state right now as I've recently had a baby and I feel like the boar hair is much more gentle than my usual paddle brush.<br /><br />It looks nice too. Quality rich wood grain appearance but without the weight of real wood. This brush is super lightweight and easy to handle .<br />I love my new brush!
B003LY91JS|1|Not too happy with this product.  Will not be buying it again.
B002BAOMAG|3|Not the best natural deodorant. The texture is nice, and the scent is mild and pleasant, but it just doesn't last, even for a natural deodorant.
B00EEYAQLQ|5|I love it
B000SWXZ3O|5|Although I love the product per se, I believe I did not get the advertised size of the Kneipp Intensive Balm. In fact, now after only a few short weeks of using it, the tube is empty. The seller was not very receptive to my enquiries. I grew up pretty close to the original Kneipp village in Germany and therefore have been using Kneipp products practically all my life while in Germany. So, I know what I am talking about.
B003JMGIC0|3|I received the product timely and in good condition.  With naturally curly hair, I am always trying different products to tame the locks.  I would say this one is pretty good for a shine-free tousled look, similar to AG's Re-Coil.  I didn't like that it does leave that filmy feeling on the hair, especially the more product you apply.  My big complaint is the packaging!  Touted as a catalyst with 2 products mixing together at time of application, the bottle has 2 reservoirs with a pump style dispenser.  Works fine til you get to the end and are left with quite a bit of trapped product and no-way to get it out!  A pretty big waste at $28 per bottle...
B00ATBIT30|5|Love it! Very satisfied with this product.  Would buy from this seller again.
B00HRSWGCI|5|I like it a lot
B002XQ1W9C|5|Rica fragancia
B002H8TVVM|5|After years of trying to get my mother on board with skincare I finally did it. I don't even know how many products that I gave her went unused and then for some mystical reason she actually used this! Not only did she like it, but she started receiving compliments on how well rested she looked and now she calls me to get her more before the jar runs out!<br />I know this brand is a little pricey but to us it is worth it.
B003QYFVRY|5|Best brush by far. I bought the model below this one twice and it broke both times. Finally I stepped up and never had any regrets.
B002PBGBX2|5|The BEST! Highly effective cleanser with a well-designed soft, rubbery applicator - scublet - that makes cleansing fast and easy. Great for gentle yet thorough cleaning. LOVE the scrublet!
B004E2M53K|5|I don't like them as much as #2, but thanks
B0067F28ZW|4|Very good love it
B008TSPR9Y|5|Really increases the length & thickness if your eyelashes. I swear by it.
B00Q9CQYCQ|5|Started making my own lotion and these are perfect!
B00064JGBO|5|Other tongue cleaner manufacturers need to take note. This isn't the cheap plastic stuff that your dentist gives away for free, this is a quality tool that will last a long time. It is also the only one that kept me from gagging during use.
B0020X8BQ0|2|Both the lipstick and the lip pencil broke the first time I used them.  The gloss is nice but only as a moisturizer.  The lipstick color is pretty enough byt feels a bit dried out adn flakes on teh lips.  Not pleased.
B00R2L69EG|3|About Me: I typically pick my toothpaste based on taste. I don't have any special dental needs i.e. sensitivity, but do feel that I have thinner enamel. I normally use and continue to like Crest Complete with Scope.<br /><br />This product was sent to me free of charge for review through BzzAgent and Crest.<br /><br />Product Details: Crest Pro Health HD Two Step Daily System comes packaged with two tubes. Step 1 is a purifying cleanser that contains Stannous fluoride 0.454% as the active ingredient. This tube weights 4.0 oz. Step 2 is the whitening/polish step that contains a hydrogen peroxide whitening gel. This tube weighs 2.3 oz.<br /><br />Usage: The directions state to brush your teeth for 1 minute with Step 1. Spit. Do not rinse. Then brush your teeth for 1 minute with Step 2. At first, I was thoroughly annoyed with having to be bothered with having to do two separate steps. But in reality, it really wasn't that much of a hassle. Once I got into the rhythm of brushing, spitting, remembering to not rinse!, and then repeating with step 2, I realized that it really wasn't that more more work. If anything, I started to like it because it forced me to be more conscious about how long I was brushing my teeth. Sometimes, &#34;two minutes&#34; is probably more like 30 seconds when it's late at night, and I'm a sleep zombie.<br /><br />Results: Honestly, I didn't see much whitening effect. That might just be because I have thin enamel on my teeth which allows the yellower dentin to show through. The product claims to have 6x whiter teeth in 1 week. I used the product for about 3 weeks to see if I could see significant whitening, and unfortunately, I did not. This product also claims to have 6x healthier mouth. That I can almost believe, although I question how they truly quantify that. The purifying cleanser step definitely gave my mouth a squeaky clean feel that lasts all day. As far as the taste of the toothpaste, it's not as minty fresh as Crest Complete Scope. But again, I didn't mind because that because the &#34;minty fresh&#34; feeling was replaced by the &#34;squeaky clean&#34; just got a &#34;dental cleaning&#34; feeling.<br /><br />Summary: Overall, I think it's a good product. I like the clean feeling that lasts all day. Again, maybe I have a predisposition with my teeth that does not allowing good whitening. I am going to have my husband test out the product to see if he sees any significant whitening. IF the whitening portion of the toothpaste does as it claims, then I can see the product being a good value. One of the things that I did have a question about was the large difference in tube size for Step1 and Step 2. I haven't finished the product yet, so I can't say if I will end up finishing one tube before the other. I will update as soon as I finish the product. Also, I noticed that some people stated sensitivity after using this product. Personally, I didn't notice any sensitivity for me.again, I didn't mind because that because the &#34;minty fresh&#34; feeling was replaced by the &#34;squeaky clean&#34; just got a &#34;dental cleaning&#34; feeling.<br /><br />Summary: Overall, I think it's a good product.

B006L5BPCU|5|love it
B00GA3A2OK|2|So, this product worked for about 2 weeks, then my phone realized it wasn't an authentic Apple product and it stopped charging my phone. I wrote the seller and told them what happened. They were very apologetic and offered to send me another cord. I told them I'd rather just have my few dollars back and they immediately granted me a full refund. A few days later, a cord arrived in the mail anyways. The product didn't work, but the seller was very agreeable and now I at least have a backup cord in case I really need one in a pinch.<br /><br />All in all, it might be nice to have this cord as a backup at work or in the car, but it's probably best just to buy a cord directly from Apple even though it's more expensive.
B00I3VHKVK|5|I tend to go with Amazon's best sellers when purchasing a product and they never let me down. These brushes are great. I have a few expensive facial brushes from Bare Essentials and these are just as good.
B0093CLRE4|5|Bought this from another source because it was just there one day while I was shopping.  Thought if it sort of worked it would save money on pedicures, and that is exactly what it does, easily.  Going barefoot most of the time callus shows up in two or three days.  This took them off easily, safely and fairly quickly.  There was no breaking of health skin no nicks and no heat from friction.  I immediately bought one for my daughter.  It is easy to use, available at home at my convience and is certainly less expensive than pedicures every month.  Highly recommend this for anyone wanting sandal ready heels.  P.S.  Tried it on elbows... it worked.
B00I3VHKVK|3|They are ok. The handle broke off immediately on 2 of the brushes. I Imagine more will break as I continue to use them. They smell weird out of the packaging so I washed them (I prob. would do that regardless). You really get what you pay for.
B003LZUUK6|1|Product is not what it says it is. It's just normal original old spice aftershave. Although it says it is &#34;fresh scent&#34; scent. Contacted seller afterwards, said they messed up on website. They wanted me to pay 35$ to send it back.... Not worth it since product was around that price
B0075W9F7U|4|Very very small.
B012Q4M3DO|5|1st of all let me tell you I love the fact that this is made in the USA and Cruelty free, both big pluses for me. I love that it is all natural products that meets the highest standard of quality, I do not like putting things on my face that are not. I love how the formulation is blended to reduce signs of aging, eliminate sun spots and damage, restore youthful glow, and minimizing existing wrinkles while preventing new wrinkle formation. Heck what woman would not want help in all those departments. I love how it leaves my skin plump, hydrated and younger-looking without feeling heavy or greasy! I definitely felt it delivered an all day moisture, evened out my skin tone and shows off my skins natural beauty.<br /><br />This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review
B004BCT98W|5|I have used this primer for a couple years and my skin looks great. Keeps the shine away as promised.
B002GQMTAK|2|This hair dryer is undoubtedly a great price and it does get the job done.  I haven't had any fuss with the fuse or anything and I supposed it's nice having the kind of \\"fabric\\" (not really...suede like?) feel of the hair dryer (Vs. plastic) for wet hands.  That said, the buttons used to operate this thing are impossible.  If you've recently put lotion on your hands then you can just forget it.  Seriously....more than once have had to use a butter knife to operate it, my friends and my mom have had the same troubles.  I would definitely pay $5 for one with better buttons.
B005XQ8CLA|5|My little sister had one of these used on her in the mall. They told her it sold for $150 (almost three times what I bought it for on here). She refused to buy it for that price and asked for it for her birthday. She initially wanted the purple leopard print, but was stoked to get the limited edition Peacock. She loves it and was so thrilled for her birthday! It works great and she loves how soft her hair is afterwards.
B003AT91A8|5|I love this product. It's exactly what I need for my super pale skin. The powder is great quality.
B00514SM3M|5|Love this product. I wear it every day on my arms as when I drive back from work I get a lot of sun. I also wear it daily when I go work out as I do it outdoors. I like the texture of it, it does not feel greasy and it does protect. I tend to get red very easliy and this product helps a lot with that. Ordering more!
B002WJHKPK|5|such a lovely fragrance. reminds me of childhood in the summer. fresh and slightly sweet. soap not overpowering at all
B008QMWM5U|5|Perfect for sensitive skin. Creamy consistency, and lasts a long time. My husband is glad to have a soap that isn't full of flowery or strong scents.
B00BTB1DXM|5|Shipped fast and was exactly what I expected.
B00TWQCUX8|2|Didn't notice any difference
B009150TRY|5|Great product!
B00MF1X0JA|4|7/2015 Fast delivery only tried so far did not irritate my skin left it on for 4 hours also used with the waist trainer and definitely helps break a extra sweat. Update later on how it works
B007H257I4|5|Excellent I will buy again I am Satisfied with the product and services
B002X9XV48|4|I got the Luminary because it was the most expensive and promoted at the tanning salon I used to go to. They were selling it for $100. I have tried other Designed Skin bronzers that are cheaper and give you better results. This isn't bad, but it definitely isn't the best.
B00L2NG7NS|5|I purchased this before my mommy makeover. I use it twice a day for the last 2 weeks. I have noticed I'm healing beautifully due to this product.
B001AO0WCG|5|The abosolute best hair and skin product!
B00433Q5L8|5|I love this fragrance.  It can be worn alone or with another cologne and lasts all day.  The roll on feature is helpful and doesn't leave your fingers smelling like patchouly.
B004VM9JCS|5|I LOVE this eye cream. this is my second time buying it because i ran out. it's definitely sensitive and it helps with the dark circles around my eyes. i also like to keep it in the fridge and apply it cool.
B000OUBC8A|4|I had to replace my other Denman, it fell apart. So far this brush has been working very well as a replacement. Its very light, compared to my other brush. No complaints.
B000ALB1VQ|4|I finally bought the Panasonic ES 8077 Vortex after much research and comparing it to other brands like the Braun 360. here is my experience with it after 4 weeks...<br /><br />The finish is cheap compared to my previous shaver [Norelco rotary]. Shaving performance is good for daily shaves, the shave is reasonably close and comparable to the Norelco, maybe even better. However not as close as a razor shave.<br /><br />The trimmer gets wet when you wash the main razor which is irritating. Also when trimming longer hair, the main shaver foil gets stuck with debris - so I have started using the plastic cover for the main foil whenever i use the trimmer.<br /><br />Charging is easy and I can charge without using the base unit by just using the cord.<br /><br />Cleaning is also easy - just use hand soap.<br /><br />Overall charge lasts 10-12 days with daily shaving.<br /><br />Overall a reliable product with no frills and some minor inconveniences. Nothing fancy to write home about. No wow factor.
B00461F4PA|5|OMG it works!  I was leery because, as everyone knows, there is not a lot of truth in advertising.  So I ordered this because of customer reviews.  I soaked my feet for 1 hour prior to using as others suggested.  And definitely don't try to walk with the booties on because of the gel in them.  Within the specified time my feet peeled like they were supposed to and I'm very pleased with the results.  I would definitely recommend this product and will probably do it again at perhaps 6 to 12 month intervals for maintenance.
B007M819E4|4|yes this product is for sensitive skin but it doesn't leave your skin feeling really clean some times it stills feel like you never wash your face on fairly warm day yes continue to use it until you can find a better product that works for you sensitve skin people, oh i give this a seven-.
B0009RL86E|5|I love my Braun Shaver System. These refills do a great job of keeping my shaver clean as they extend the useful life of the system.
B003AXEGWW|4|NOTE: If you don't have wavy/curly hair, you shouldn't buy this product. Several reviews complain that it doesn't suds. It isn't supposed to, but if you have straight hair (or have never followed the Deva product \\"way\\") you would think you're buying a product that isn't working. Sulfates aren't good for curly hair, but they do make shampoo sudsy. You don't want that if you are just cleaning your scalp (like people with curly hair should be doing).<br /><br />I purchased this as something to change up my typical no-poo by deva. I already use Argan oil in my hair post shower as my finishing product. The shampoo is definitely different than no-poo in that it will lather, but it's not like regular shampoo because you really have to work it for a while before a flat lather appears. It is also clear, which leads me to believe there aren't any added chemicals to make it appear a certain way.<br /><br />The smell is almost identical to the Argan oil, but not as strong since you're rinsing it out. Since I use it to replace no-poo, I use it to clean my scalp rather than foam up my hair. It seems to be effective and my hair is nice and shiny whether I wear it curly or straighten it.
B00FQBO996|4|This was my introduction into higher end product paints, and I really felt it was good purchase. Depending on how much water you use is how opaque the product will be - my ONE complaint, and the reason this got 4 instead of 5 stars, is no matter how little water you use, the white still seems to come out kind of thin and see-through. The colors are gorgeous, and you get a really decent amount for the quality and price.
B003ZYGPOS|5|love the product. arrived quickly. great price. i highly recommend this product from this company. i will reorder if available.
B000PB0Q1C|5|Great!
B000CEFV94|5|Hair nets are just perfect! They are resistant, color-coded, and soft.  My daugthers are very happy with this product. Buy it!
B005FYJB92|1|AWFUL!!!!! It looks orange, not nude. Very disappointed.
B000LRHGTK|5|Fast shipping, great product, with wonderful original sent!
B00W8SBZBU|5|Very happy with my purchase work perfectly fine
B00F48C08S|5|Zealios is great stuff. It isn't oily and have I have worn it playing sport, mostly rugby, many times and have never had it run into my eyes or really ever notice I was wearing Sunscreen at all. Definitely recommended at anytime but especially for sport.
B00FZIUHL4|5|Tried for one month and had minimal results. A few months later I decided to try again and this time do at least a few months and that’s when I started to see some seriously awesome results! Long story short my hair is growing THICK AND STRONG and has stopped falling out. I have a receding hairline and this has helped restore about 80 percent of it in a mere few months. Awesome product, awesome results and thank god I found it.
B000NRSZTS|5|Great Price! Love it!
B001F51VZM|5|I don't think I can be without this product.  Superb, it keeps you fresh all day long.
B00HGA972Y|2|The &#34;shimmer &#34;eyeshadows just seem to have shimmer on the top as a cover wen u actually use the shadow there's no more shimmer underneath after the first swipe of the shadow,  its just a coloured powder after
B004TSFB1M|5|Perfect size, such soft bristles! Use this one daily!
B00EEK1LKK|5|I ordered this because I had a little bottle from a hotel we stayed in.  It's a terrific lotion.  I wasn't so sure about getting a sack of a jillion little bottles, but actually it's kind of handy.  They're everywhere!....my purse, my office, my bathroom, etc., etc.  Surely this way I won't be totally out before I realize I need to reorder!
B00C88BU1A|5|so mush better than costume shop wigs,fits the head well and is not uncomfortable even with long hair.  I am impressed
B004SGKMA0|5|100 blades for $10 they come prepacked in little plastic boxes inside the big cardboard one. Very smooth shave, and I have coarse facial hair.
B00B1DSHSW|1|I wish I could write the same review for all of these products. I've been using Pantene Pro V - Truly Relaxed and Truly Natural since before it was renamed. I started using these products when they were all one Shampoo And Conditioner just called Pantene for Women of Color back in 2002. Ever since the company decided to do a line for natural and a line for relaxed hair, these products do not work for me. The shampoo in either line or the conditioner. I'm writing this today because after continuing to use this line out of habit and dedication I've decided that I'm over it The only good version of their conditioner comes in the Textures and Tones hair color box - other than that, no. Try something else.
B00CH6IQSI|4|This item is exactly as it appears, except the massage rollers. My back scratcher does not have them as it shows.
B00366E8I0|1|I bought the 18inch and I was very disappointed. Hair extensions were too thin!  usually people double the tracks but these weren't. I feel like I got ripped off!!
B0037Y21I0|5|It is the perfect size. It really gets the roots. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. I highly recommend this Professional Hair Dye Applicator Brush!
B00K4PLC30|5|Great Product
B000C1UC8C|5|my favorite perfume...I get compliments all the time!
