B0001NBMBC|2.0|This is so not Slipknot. If you've heard Stone Sour, you'll realize this cd belongs to them, not Slipknot. Corey's vocals on this cd are just horrible. He doesn't even really scream anymore, which used to be really cool. He uses his clean voice more and while that might seem good, it actually isn't. i thought the drumming was pretty cool on this cd, that's why i gave it 2 stars, but besides that, there's not really anything worth listening to on this album.
B00006RU5B|4.0|I admit that when I first listened to this CD, I was a little  disappointed. Many of the lyrics on this album sound like they were thought up on the spot. \\"Just sing the first word that comes to mind, as long as it rhymes.\\" I'd rather hear the first word that doesn't rhyme. That would be more interesting, and less predictable. I really expected better lyrics from Chris Cornell. That being said, there are some great songs here. Where else are you gonna hear Cornell's latest? i.e.\\"Like a Stone\\" and \\"I am the Highway\\". I like \\"Hypnotize\\", it has a nice slow rhythm, and a good message in the words.\\"Shadow on the Sun\\" is alright, but the ending, when he repeats that line about 10 times, is too much.\\"Show Me How to Live\\" is a pretty good song. I still like listening to it. \\"Set it Off\\" is kind of weak, and sounds like it was made up on the spot.         The opening song \\"Cochise\\" is one of those songs I had to listen to a few times to really get into. \\"Bring Em Back Alive\\" is also one of my favorites, but would have been better without the extraneous guitar effects, though I do like the funky guitar effects on the other tracks.       I believe Rage Against the Machine started the whole Rap/Metal sound that is so popular now, but no one has been able to do it with the soul that they had. Audioslave is good, but it is less than the sum of its parts.
B000002UA5|3.0|I loved &quot;Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict&quot; I believe my exact words were &quot;It sounds like they set fire to a zoo&quot;. It was the funniest thing I've ever heard, and I love it for that, but I rather there be more lyrics. Instrumental albums rather annoy me.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I love this album, it has many great songs on it. By far the best songs are 'He wasn't', 'Forgotten' and 'Slipped Away'. I feel this album is very different to Let Go which is more pop music than real music. Under my skin has a much wider appeal. I can,t wait for the next one which I can tell will be far better and more satisfying.
B0000019PA|5.0|This is undoubtably the rareist type of album, a true classic, Iv'e seen complaints about the production, and his voice. two of the best qualities of this album. for those bad talking his singing, give it another listen. I dont think I have ever heard any other singer sing so strongly, and clearly without talking a breath. it's amazing. parts of this album are almost imposible to keep up with when singing along. The production is perfect as well, it matches the guitar,vocals,lyrics,and mood of the music. This album reminds me more of a vivid and beautiful dream then anything else. It seems like nonsense when it's over, but in the moment of listening, you dont care, you dont even notice how abstract it is. I think it's music more for the sub-conciance then concinace mind.
B00005R5G9|5.0|Andrew McCarthy,back in 1986 when he was a teen idol,co-starred with Kim Cattrall in this hysterical romance film. Jonathan Switcher(McCarthy) has held,but not for long,various jobs. Some of those jobs only lasted a few hours! But that all changed when Jonathan came to a department store and found his main superior,a late 50ish-early 60ish woman,very sweet and loving. He did everything at the store. He was a sales clerk,manager and even a security guard. At the store,in one of the ladies' departments,he discovers a beautiful female mannequin who comes alive. Cattrall,is the mannequin named Emmy. She even becomes the girl of his dreams! Jonathan couldn't be happier. Another security guard(G.W. Bailey) finds Jonathan pretending the mannequin is a real woman and romancing it. To everyone except Jonathan until the final scene,Emmy is an &quot;it&quot;. James Spader plays one of Jonathan's immediate supervisors. Steve Vinovich is the store's president. Jonathan had broken up with his pre-Emmy girlfriend. So the girlfriend and her new boyfriend spy on Jonathan in the store and with a camera. Jonathan and Emmy are riding a motorcycle in one scene in formal apparel,with Jonathan operating the vehicle. Everyone else observes the &quot;it&quot; behind Jonathan on the bike. Jonathan almost lost Emmy to a trash incinerator in operation. The shoes she wore were destroyed by the incinerator. Bailey's and Vinovich's characters were taken into police custody after committing some kind of devious crime. The surveillance camera caught them in the act. It was then when the mannequin &quot;died&quot; and &quot;was reincarnated as&quot; a real woman. In the final scene,we see Jonathan and Emmy tying the knot. The featured song is &quot;Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now&quot;,recorded by Starship. Bailey and Cattrall previously appeared in 1984's POLICE ACADEMY.
B00000JTB2|5.0|This is great stuff!! Two legendary blues guitarists which have a tremendous time together playing the blues. The CD contains fast rock/blues tracks but also long tracks of awsome slow blues. Sit down on your chair with a glass of beer and a cigarette and relax: this is some of the best blues you'll ever will get!<br />Respect!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Her album rocks and she's great. I love her! <BR>(and Britney sucks!)
B00008BRB5|5.0|Less predicatble than Ghost in the Machine, more coherent than Zenyatta Mondatta, more tuneful than Outlandos D'Amors, and more emotional than Regatta da Blanc, Synchronicity is the best album by The Police.  It starts off with the title track which is startling for being the best thing ever inspired by Carl Jung.  (The contrast with Margaret Atwood and Robertson Davies is particularly noteworthy.)  Then we have the eerie, nervous and always timely &quot;Walking in our Footsteps,&quot; although now we have environmental disaster more to fear than nuclear war.  The next song starts a tendency we will see on Sting's next two albums, in &quot;Love is the Seventh Wave&quot; and &quot;We'll be Together,&quot; making a slight reference to a song in the previous album.  There are few admirers of Andy Summer's &quot;Mother,&quot; but as a portrait of hysterical neurosis, it has few echoes.  Then we have Stewart Copeland's &quot;Miss Gradenko,&quot; a nice nasty little portrait of a police state that had a lot less time than anyone would have thought in 1983.  And finally on the first side we have &quot;Synchronicity II,&quot; which was the third American single and one of Sting's more radical songs.  This is a bitter song about modern life (&quot;the secretaries pout and preen/like cheap tarts on a red light street...&quot;) full of pollution, madness, abuse of power with a supernatural undercurrent.<br />But of course it is the second side that has made this album's reputation.  The last one, not originally on the record, is &quot;Murder by Numbers,&quot; a sardonic little ditty and more subtle than later Sting songs like &quot;History teaches Nothing.&quot;  There is the genuinely strange &quot;Tea in the Sahara,&quot; about unearthly sisters.  And then, of course, there are the three songs about the collapse of marriage and love that are perhaps the Police's three most famous singles.  It helps immensely that the object of &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger,&quot; is not amagus but a lover.  And then there is the simplicity of &quot;King of Pain.&quot;  This is one of the best songs of the 1980s, or ever, but it is obviously overshadowed by its predecessor.  Sting himself has commented on how people have thought &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; is a love song.  On one level this sounds alarming since the song is obviously about a stalker.  But this is more than just the well-known phenomenon of not paying attention to the lyrics.  There is a genuine sense of loss and feeling in the song which, while not love, is passionate enough to be confused with it.  Passion and ambiguity, alone with all of The Police's special talents, make this one of the best five songs of the eighties.
B00005K9QP|5.0|Why on earth anyone would give this LP a low rating because it's done by British white boys is beyond me. That smacks of puritanism at its finest. It's like saying Chet Baker was a lousy jazz guy because he was white. These guys were playing what they loved and emulating their heroes. Clapton plays with a passion and fire that transcends racial or gender issues. He was a young musician trying to make his mark and that's where we as listeners really benefit. His focus is on his music and the critics be damned. I'm originally from Chicago's southside and know the old southside (go sox) blues clubs intimately. You could walk in there and mention this albumn and the musicians (mostly black) and the patrons (mostly black) would sing its praises. The nay sayers need to get a grip. I've lived the Chicago blues scene and this albumn is a must. During a conversation I had with the late great Lefty Dizz he told me this was his favorite blues albumn. Go figure..a black blues musician disagreeing with the white purists. Does that make Hendrix a lousy rock player. Do youself a favor and but this albumn!
B00000JCOV|5.0|from the heart pounding of (Sic) to the amazeing sound of Scissors, this is an awesome starting c/d for the most amazeing and self owning band SLIPKNOT, with songs like, wait and bleed, surfacing, liberate, diluted, tattered and torn and no life this album is an amzeing heart pounding ass kicking metal album........stay sick f***ers
0553573403|4.0|First of all let me say that I really enjoyed this book, and the next two that have come out so far as well. It is engrossing and the world Martin has created is spectacular. Many people have a problem with the plethora of names, especially in the first book when they are all unkowns, and I admit that it threw me for a while too. However, once you start to get a grip on all of the names you begin to really get into a wonderful story that I would highly recommend. The reason I gave it four out of five stars, however, is the trashy sex scenes peppered throughout the series. At first you read it and think \\"Whoa, what just happened\\" then after the second or third such scene you begin to dread them coming along. Let me just say that using words like \\"throbbing manhood\\" or \\"taking him into her\\", things like that should be avoided like the plague. If you're going to talk about sex just say what you mean and avoid the cliche. If you're going talk about a penis then use the word. But besides that the series is quite good and worth the time, just be aware that the less clothing the characters are wearing the worse the writing will likely be.
0312263120|2.0|This book is readable, but just barely, because it is fast paced and action packed.  To me, it couldn't hold a candle to DVC - but perhaps that is because, even as an amateur, I know more about cryptography then I do about religion.<br /> Good fiction must be filled with details that are plausible even if they are fabricated, else readers can't suspend disbelief.  DF fails that test.  Other reviewers here have noted repeatedly the lack of research or depth of understanding about cryptography or computers apparent, but I would like to mention several concrete examples, of varying importance:<br />1. David Becker, the brilliant professor at Georgetown University in the nation's capital, has never heard of the National Security Agency, which was subject of the bestseller, \\"The Puzzle Palace\\", and is frequently mentioned in the Washington Post.  How smart could he be to miss a low value Jeopardy question?<br />2. The U.S. government keeps all its critical sensitive computer files in one central system without a backup, and it takes at least 45 minutes to pull the plug.  This isn't how it's done, and it makes no sense that anyone would do it that way.  Talk about a disaster waiting to happen!<br />3. The Digital Fortress computer file is allegedly encrypted with itself - but apart from the assertions of its author, there is no reason to believe that to be the case.  Apparently the top crypto guy at NSA believes it, as do savvy high-tech CEOs in Japan.  The inability to \\"crack the code\\" with TRANSLTR, when TRANSLTR fails to find any clear text, is equally consistent with there having been no clear text in the first place.<br />4. My favorite: The NSA's big iron, TRANSLTR, solves any encrypted file through brute force, that is, systematically trying all possible keys until it hits the right one.  Brute force works in theory but can't possibly be implemented to achieve this level of universal success in practice.  The book claims that TRANSLATR can solve almost any code in 10 minutes because of its massive parallel processing capacity.  But that means that if the key is extended by one binary bit - a one or a zero - there are now twice as many possible keys, and a code that could cracked this way in 10 minutes would now take 20 minutes.  Adding 5 digits would require 320 minutes (over 5 hours).  Adding 10 digits would require over 10,000 minutes (over 170 hours).  You get the idea - it's the story of the King, the Pauper, the Chess Board, and the Grains of Rice that the King must double each day on each successive square (see, for example, [...] ).  I absolutely couldn't get my mind around this fantasy.  I'm sure the NSA uses supercomputers (but less sure they are massively parallel) - but if it \\"reads\\" PGP encryptions, it is because it knows how to find the prime factors of numbers that are the product of two very, very large primes - and not through brute force.<br />5. The book claims the Nagasaki bomb wasn't based on plutonium 239, yet numerous authoritative sources on the web indicate it was.  I don't know who is right, but I do know you can't make a bomb out of U238, which is plain old non-fissile uranium.10 minutes because of its massive parallel processing capacity.

B0001UL7RY|2.0|She's not The Best But i Must Admit she's Better Then Some. She's got her own style and her own way of singing that I reapeat IS NOT PUNK! (Sorry but she's not.) This CD includes three of her best songs and popular singles, &quot;Happy Ending,&quot; &quot;Slipped Away&quot; and &quot;Don't Tell Me.&quot; Although in my opinion her first album was much better and easier to listen to.
B0000025ZF|4.0|No one can tell a story in music like Roger Waters. To him the lyrics are everything, and the music is there to support those lyrics. This can be heard throughout the \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\" as Waters' voice take precedence over everything else. This album was originally brought before Pink Floyd with another project to vote upon which to do. They picked \\"The Wall\\" instead, which was probably a smart choice. Although not quite Floyd quality, the album is actually surprising good, although it was outranked by David Gilmour's \\"About Face\\", which probably added to the strain on their relationship.<br />I won't even pretend to understand the story Waters' is trying to tell on this album, but I assume it follows some Hunter S. Thompson vision of wacked-out reality through dreams. What I do understand is that Waters' pulled out the stops to make this album successful by hiring Eric Clapton to handle the guitar work, and David Sanborn for sax. It is without doubt that Clapton carried this album further into mainstream acceptance than merit alone. Likewise, when Waters' allows Clapton free rein, the songs are good. \\"Running Shoes\\" rocks heavily, and \\"For the First Time Today, Part 2\\" (the first one) Clapton plays with a bluesy feel, which carries into \\"Sexual Revolution\\". The title track is the highlight of the album. <br />Although this album pales compared to Waters' \\"Radio K.A.O.S.\\" it is still better than his other studio albums. Clapton has some great licks throughout the album, and Waters' has some great lyrics in here as well. Waters' ability to compose music around his story is amazing, and none can match his talent. I may not understand the story, and the music alone may not be overly noteworthy, but when combined it is a formula that works. A must have for Floyd fans.
B000053SPI|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing Journey's DirecTV concert special before the Arrival album's release in 2001, and a lot of people had said the same thing before hand: &quot;Journey without Steve Perry is unthinkable...&quot; then out came Steve Augeri onstage and people were standing there with their mouths down to the ground hearing this guy hit all the notes. Anyone who thinks Journey should have changed directions instead of getting someone who could sing their biggest songs and do them justice needs to ask themselves: Does Journey need to do the songs that made them great or do they need someone like the lead singer of ZZ Top trying to sing Open Arms and Faithfully? Journey is known for those hits and so much more. You need someone who can sing them. Styx, on that same note, found the perfect act to follow Dennis DeYoung in Lawrence Gowan...and in return, we don't have to sit through songs like &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; and &quot;Babe&quot; in concert, which the rest of the band were never big fans of to begin with. Both Journey's &quot;Arrival&quot; and Styx' &quot;Cyclorama&quot; show what the bands are both made of...and it's a nice progression from what could have been disastrous for both bands. You won't be disappointed in either album...and last year they toured together with REO Speedwagon, and the shows just ROCKED. It's nice to remember all the hits they had with their former lead singers, but it's a testimony to their determination to remain vital musical units that these two albums are as GREAT as they both are. Wherever Steve Perry is, may he come out with some new music as good as this...and I hope he does...nothing against him for his choice to leave, but the band deserves to carry on, and carry on it does well...same goes for Styx!
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I got the new Slipknot CD yesterday already knowing what it sounded like because I am a member of Road Runner Records Street Team, so I got to hear it a week before it came out. When i first heard it, it astonished me that Slipknot had turned into Stone Sour. Look Corey we like Stone Sour but we wanted in all out pounding, thrash metal CD from SLIPKNOT not STONE SOUR! If you like Stone Sour i reccomend this CD to you. IF you're just now getting into Slipknot i Reccomend one of there older albums(Slipknot, IOWA). If you're a die-hard Slipknot fan and have all there CD's get this CD otherwise go get there old albums. Here's a list of there songs and ranks for them:<br />1.Prelude 3.0- 3/5 It starts out like a Slipknot song and is pretty good. <br />2.The Blister Exists- 5/5 This is an excellent song, this one definately sounds like Slipknot.<br />3.Three Nil- 4/5 This song pretty much is a mixture of Stone Sour sound and Slipknot sound.<br />4.Duality- 5/5 This is there first single and is a good song.<br />5.Opium of the People- 5/5 This is good track.<br />6.Circle- 2/5 Its a good song buts its acoustic and its not Slipknot.<br />7.Welcome- 4/5 This is a good song but it sorta sounds like Stone Sour.<br />8.Vermillion- 2/5 This an acoustic track and isnt that good.<br />9.Pulse of the Maggots- 5/5 This song is good and is actually the first song i heard from there new album.<br />10.Before I Forget- 5/5 This track sounds like Stone Sour.<br />11.Vermillion Pt. 2- 2/5 This is another acoustic track and it is a continue of Vermillion.<br />12.The Nameless- 4/5 This a good song but gets really slow in some parts.<br />13.The Virus of Life- 4/5 This sounds like Slipknot but it really isnt a song, its more of just talking, it sounds like something off of IOWA.<br />14.Danger-Keep Away- 4/5 This a slow song but it does sound like Slipknot and its good.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I've been listening to this album for a couple weeks now...(I got a pre-release copy)and I can see where people may say that Slipknot has ditched their sound or changed into Stone Sour....opinions are like...well, ya know.  <BR>   I get so sick of the same old &quot;cookie monster&quot; vocals over and over in metal.  I'm very glad to see some awesome guitar work, solos and actual SINGING!<BR>  There are a couple songs that are simply &quot;ok&quot;, but for the most part, this collection is solid and a step up from previous work.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I do admit her song &quot;Toxic&quot; is catchy, and her song &quot;Everytime&quot; is nice, but other than those two songs, the album is boring and the songs are horrible.  &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; stinks and I hate it.  &quot;Boom Boom&quot; is the most horrifying, annoying, pathetic song I've ever heard in my life!  There is no point to that song except for yelling out words on the off beat.  &quot;Early Morning&quot; also has no point to it but I believe it is definitely better than &quot;Boom Boom&quot;.  I am done with this review, and though there are two good songs I like, I believe a good album needs at least 6 out of ten songs that are good.  Britney's album just doesn't have that.  Sorry all you Britney fans, but she stinks!
6304698623|5.0|Let's just say it right now: This is one of the best children's movies ever made. It didn't do well at the box office, but that has nothing to do with its quality, which is spectacular. <br />Sara is a rich girl who lives in India with her father. Her mother was dead. As her father is called to Europe for World War One, Sara is sent to a prestigious boarding school in New York City. She quickly becomes a favorite among the students, who love her mystical tales. One person, the headmistress Miss Minchin, is not as pleased with Sara's imaginative stories. When news comes that her father died in war, Miss Minchin takes everything of Sara's and makes her a servant in the school. She befriends Becky, the other servant, and it's her imagination that keeps her going.<br />This movie has many beautiful moments. When Sara recieves the news of her father's death, the look on her face is devestating. When she is in trouble for having the other girls in her attic room, she confronts Miss Minchin, and hits a nerve when she asks about Miss Minchin's father. After Sara is locked away, Miss Minchin wipes away a tear, and we see that her father never loved her. It's nice that a villain has more than one layer for a change. When Sara dances in the snow, I think that's one of the most beautiful moments in the movie. And finally, when her father gets his memory back and they hug in the rain. That amazing scene pretty much tells you what the movie is about. It's about imagination, love, and never stopping believing that magical things can happen. This is a movie every family should have. In a word: Perfect.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When you think of a band like slipknot you would think back to there first album, a bunch of idoits wearing masks, and just jumping around to bad music, but dont let the sterotype get to you, this album is very mature and very musical, the araganment of the songs are brilant.Although i must say i thought the percusionst were not needed before, they actually do more on this album, but i still think the dj is uneeded. my personal favorite tracks are, dulaity, the blister exists, three nil, before i forget and pulse of the maggots, i highly recomond checking this cd out
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I loved the first album, the second was ok,but this thing sucks, you would be better off buying anything from Relapse Records that's where the REAL METAL is at!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne has a great album on her hands again. &quot;Let Go&quot; will always be classic and may always be thought of as her best album since it was her first, but &quot;Under My Skin&quot; will be remembered as a great and mature follow-up that can stand on its own. Avril may have needed &quot;Let Go&quot; to get her foot in the door, but now she has the freedom and experience to share deeper and darker feelings with her audience. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is definitely darker and she brings in new instruments like the piano and strings. She sings about heartbreak, frustration, and even death. The CD insert has some great photos of her too. All in all, this CD will definitely be playing in my CD player continuously for awhile.<br />Songs:<BR>Take Me Away- Features Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle) on drums which is always a plus. This is a great song to start the album off on. It didn't stick in my brain like some other songs and the way she sings the chorus can get a little annoying, but I think it will grow on me. I really like the guitar in this one.<BR>Together- I love the piano in this. Again, the chrous gets on my nerves a little bit, but the piano is so awesome sounding that it cancels that slight negative out.<BR>Don't Tell Me- Great radio song. I loved it the first time I heard it. Great lyrics too.<BR>He Wasn't- I think this is one of the weaker songs on the album.<BR>How Does it Feel- Very mellow song. It really shows off Avril's singing abilities, in my opinion. Also, there are violins and other strings, which sound awesome.<BR>My Happy Ending- My favorite song on the album. The great thing of it is that the lyrics are negative, but the music isn't dark at all. Just a fabulous song. Will probably be the next single.<BR>Nobody's Home- One of my other favorite songs. I love the music and the lyrics are moving. I'm sure everyone has had the same feelings of hopelessness that you can hear in Avril's voice.<BR>Forgotten- Another song with Josh Freese on drums. It has the same feeling that &quot;Unwanted&quot; had from &quot;Let Go&quot;. Just very angry. I like this one too.<BR>Who Knows- One of the only positive songs on the album. I like the versus, but the chorus kind of sticks out like a sore thumb.<BR>Fall to Pieces- Good song overall.<BR>Freak Out- The beginning of this song rocks. Actually, the whole song rocks.<BR>Slipped Away- A very nice tribute to Avril's grandfather. Nice strings and piano too.<br />I really can't stand pop music, but there is something about Avril that I love. Probably because she's the closest to rock you'll get out of that pond. I think she's a pretty talented artist who gets ragged on for no reason. Buy &quot;Under My Skin&quot;! You know you want to!!
0805062971|5.0|I had seen the movie Fight Club and really loved it, then I saw the book in the library.  At first I thought, \\"Well I've seen the movie so I've ruined all the surprises.\\"  A few days later I was still thinking about the movie and decided to go check out the book.    Not to use a clich but you won't be able to put it down.  Even if you have seen the movie, the book is so much more in depth that it will just consume you.<BR> This book covers so many topics that it is hard to place it in a specific genre.  It talks about materialism, love, conformity, bad parents, and more.  Because Fight Club covers so many topics I think it makes it a great read for everybody form teenage and up.  After I read the book I was suggesting it to tons of people but many of them kind of looked at me like, yeah right.  But really this book isn't just about a Fight Club. it has deeper meaning.<BR> This book also has really smart humor.  I am just going to share one little quote describing the safety pamphlets on airplanes:<BR> \\"In another picture, people as calm as Hindu cows reach up from their seats toward oxygen masks sprung out of the ceiling.<BR>This must be an emergency.<BR>Oh.<BR>We've lost cabin pressure.<BR>Oh.\\"<BR> The first chapter jumps around a lot, but keep reading as it just gets better as you go.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00011D1OA|2.0|WARNING: All the five stars refer to the movie itself, and does not address the issue of whether paying for the second disc is a rip-off.  Five stars for the single disc version was richly deserved.  I had half expected the 2 disc version to have DTS since they shifted virtually all the extra features from disc 1 to disc two.  The only thing left on disc 1 was the movie, same commentary, same subtitles and audio track.  If they had an audio track with Audrey singing in place of Marni Nixon, it would have been a dream dvd.  For some inexplicable reason, the single disc version was among the Amazon top 100 discs in 2002 for some time, although it has been out since the mid-90s.  Amazon's editor was correct when he said the main attraction of the 2nd disc was the 58 minute Documentary hosted by Jeremy Brett.  Move along folks, folks, nothing to see here, nothing really new unless you are time warped back one or two decades.  A concise version of this documentary would be \\"The Fairest Fair Lady\\" which is already in the single disc version.<br /><br />You already HAVE the Audrey Hepburn Vocals in the single disc version.  The rest of the stuff in disc 2 is usually given away FREE, like in Gladiator, Last Samurai, Master and Commander, where one viewing of the stills is more than enough.<br /><br />Now, the sellers of the 2-disc set have actually REMOVED the CAST AND CREW section found in the one disc version.  This Cast and Crew with filmographies and biographies contain a huge chunk of valuable information including the fact that Audrey's given name was Edda, not Audrey.  Do not throw away your one disc version.  If you bought the 2 disc version, you might want to buy the single- disc version to find out where Audrey Hepburn was born, won the Oscar and got nominated. What were the other actors like Wilfred Hyde-White doing other than My Fair Lady.<br /><br />I tell you what I like about the 2 Disc version:<br /><br />1.  the interviews with Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison at the 1963 production Kickoff Dinner, with a couple of jokes from Mr Warner.<br />2.  George Cukor directing Baroness Rothschild: a Henry Higgins coaching Eliza Doolitle parody.  The audio track ran for only a few minutes, and I had a new found respect for Directors. Even a Baroness needs lessons in elocution.  When I watch the movie again, I will imagine George Cukor speaking using the actors and actresses as his instrument.  It explains how Cukor's actresses got their Oscars.<br />3.  The Los Angeles Premiere in B&W is a few minutes of glitterati distraction.<br /><br />The rest of Disc 2 is really scraping the floor of the store-room.  For those who already own the single disc edition, and do not have disposable income to burn, get the 2 disc edition of the TEN COMMANDMENTS instead.  For the price of 5 commandments (about half the price of the 2 disc My Fair Lady), you will get more than double the enjoyment, making it look like \\"the TWENTY COMMANDMENTS\\".  That is where a second disc is not purely a money making exercise: thou shalt not steal from gullible covetuous dvd buyers.<br /><br />Rex Harrison Golden Globe Acceptance is a clip from the Andy William's show, where he apologised for not being at the real event, so he accepted it on AW's show.  Shame.<br /><br />Academy Awards Cermony Highlights: just one minute or less of Mr Warner accepting the oscar for best picture.  Not one bit of the other awards at all.<br /><br />So two stars for the additional info on disc two.  I would buy anything remotely related to my favourite musical, but if I were to search my heart for value added, I would say two extra stars is very very generous.  Now, if ever they come out with a DTS version, we will have to throw the whole TWENTY COMMANDMENTS at this bunch of crooks for not putting DTS into this version.<br /><br />Do you really need Martin Scorsese and Andrew Lloyd Weber's comments on My Fair Lady to supplement your own?  What is their connection to My Fair Lady anyway, that we must hear what they have to say about this musical in the \\"Special Features\\".  When we do not hear from Andre Previn who was responsible for the score, there is no need to hear from Andrew Lloyd Webber.pecial Features\\".

B000002JS8|5.0|This is one rockin' album! It is heavier than the other albums AC/DC released with original singer Bon Scott. Like Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap wasn't that heavy. But this is. While many may say Back In Black is the band's best, I feel it is this one. While the title track may be a little overplayed, all the other songs are pure 70's metal fury. All these songs are great to bang your head to. Girls Got Rhythym, the second song after the title track is one of the best on the album. The controversial Night Prowler is probably the best on the album. It is a slower, more melodic song. Sounds a lot like Danzig's Killer Wolf. Other great songs are Shot Down In Flames and Touch Too Much.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|She says the songs on the album are more rocking?? Yeah right!!!! &quot;ALL&quot; of her sounds sound the same. I just can't believe she spent 2 YEARS to record such a sucky record. Her first album was Great this one is nothing but the crap...its really bad. I recommend people to either download and burn her music ....or just start listening to katy rose . THIS ALBUM IS THE WORST!!!!!!!!!!! SOrry...AVril ...nice try!!!!!!!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First off, if you come to this CD looking for it to sound exactly like MFKR, the self titled album, or Iowa you need to go pick up one of those albums. Vol. 3 isn't a rerelease of any previous Slipknot albums, it's a new one. And that being said, this album kicks ass. It's art, pure and simple. Stand out tracks are the first single, Duality, Vermilion, Before I Forget, and The Virus of Life. Things you will find on this CD: The screaming we all know and love in addition to a more melodic vocal sound. The band is still rocking just as hard, but is expanding its style. (You don't want to keep releasing the same 14 songs over and over again under a different title, ya know?). What you won't find on here is any explitives. And it doesn't take away from the album at all. Thumbs up to the band for expressing their thoughts and emotions with an increased vocabulary that doesn't involve all of the four letter words that little wannabe rebel teenagers out there think are necessary to show how pissed off you are. Buy the album, you won't regret it unless you're one of those whinny brats that think a band should use the same sound on every cd they release.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|How anyone can say these guys have gone soft needs to listen to the other crap out there.  Even Pantera, my favorite hometown band, broke up and have gone soft on me.  Listen to the lyrics of the second to last song.  It's about a stalker getting ready to kill his victim.  Is that soft, I don't think so.  The drums are incredible in this album.  Rick Rubin is a master at pushing a band to their absolute threshold of talent.  They did it and I will be going off on people in my car for months to this cd.
0805062971|5.0|I didn't read this book until after I saw the movie, and I loved the movie.  What I really like about this book is how easy to read it is.  The story moves along more quickly than all of Palahniuk's other novels, which I suppose helped in its translatioon to the screen.  There is less build up and a simple plot.  This is one of those books that every once in a while I pick back up and read again, just because it is fun and easy.  The major messages about society and work and modern life are slap-you-in-the-face obvious, but that fact doesn't take away from their validity or from the more subtle points about friendship and relationships.
B00008CLOA|5.0|First I want to say that I am 15. The album was made 15 years before I was ever born. 30 years after its creation a lot of the lyrics could still be applied to modern day issues. The entire song Money (a great one by the way) reminds me of the enron scandle. Alot of the song Us and Them can be appiled to whats going on in the middle east. Brain damage for me is really the song that drives home what you have been listening to for the last 45 minutes. This is definately an album that will leave you in awe after its finished.<br />(I apoligise{stupid lack of spell check} for all the AWFUL music my generation is making and if I could stop them i WOULD.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is not as heavy as IOWA but its better. I was very shocked to hear an acoustic song. Thats the last thing i thought i would hear on a slipknot cd. The acoutic songs are very good though. Duality is the first single and the best song. If you liked the first album then this is a must have. Slipknots back and they RULE!!!!!!!!!
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I've heard the album, I hate to admit that after the first two Albums Slipknot has gone downhill.  Where is the rugged hard sound that they used to have.  Only a few songs on the album have that sound, that is why i gave it 2 stars.  Is it worth the few dollars to purchase, &quot;yes&quot; if you are a hardcore slipknot fan, &quot;No&quot; if you only liked a few of their songs to begin with.  I myself may not be getting this album.  The rest is solely up to you all.
078681859X|5.0|This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. From the very beginning you can tell this is not one of those standard issue sword-and-sorcery novels with the Dark Lord, the Quest, the many races (elves, dwarves, orcs, etc), the young hero, the Old Wizard, etc. So you won't be stuck with a Tolkien wannabe. On the other hand, despite having an eleven year old magician's apprentice as \\"hero\\", it's most definitively NOT a Harry Potter clone. For starters, little Nathaniel's motivation is pure and simple revenge, and that doesn't change by book's end. <br />In this modern day version of London, magicians are an aristocracy (although, since British magicians aren't allowed to have children to avoid dynastic conflicts, I guess oligarchy would be a better name) that rules Britain and its Empire, and commoners without magic have no political power. Taken from his family when he was five, Nathaniel has no friends and his whole world is his Master (a pathetic midlevel government magician), his master's wife, and his teachers. He grows up to be a very intelligent and gifted magician, with a relatively good heart, but also very arrogant and vengeful. So when the powerful magician Simon Lovelace beats and humiliates him in public while his cowardly master just watches, he begins his quest to get even.<br />It takes him a year but without any help he finally masters a very complex spell that allows him to summon a powerful djinni named Bartimaeus to steal the Amulet of Samarkand, Lovelace's most priced possession. Because in this world the only so called \\"power\\" that magicians have is their ability to summon and enslave spirits that do all the magical work for them. And believe me, the spirits don't like it one bit. And here is where the book begins, when we get our first look at Bartimaeus, who is one of the funniest characters you'll ever meet. Since all the chapters from his point of view are written in the first person, we get the full blast of his wit, which is considerable. It's the first time I've seen footnotes used with such a great effect. In them Bartimaeus makes little commentaries and explanations about what is going on, which is an excellent way to provide information about the back-story without interrupting the flow of the narration, and avoids boring the reader. Believe me, the footnotes are the best part of the book.<br />So Bartimaeus goes and reluctantly steals the Amulet from Lovelace's home and of course, everything blows up in their faces. From then on its one mess after another involving betrayal, power struggles and murder.  <br />A funny thing about this book is it seems there is no good guy. All the characters have negative qualities aplenty. All the magicians are arrogant jackasses with really tacky taste (they like jugglers a lot) who don't even consider commoners as \\"real\\" people. And that includes Nathaniel. In any regular book, by the end the hero has identified with the oppressed and taken up his cause. In this novel, Nathaniel's encounter with the Resistance only leaves him wanting to hunt them down to ensure the continuation of the magician's privileges. <br />This reminds me of another point I really liked about this book is that Stroud avoided the trap of trying to do too much. The Resistance plays only a small role; it catches your attention and really leaves you wanting more. He doesn't explain their abilities and their small plot doesn't get resolved. You can tell Stroud is laying the foundation for the other books in the trilogy. Personally, I can't wait for the next one. <br />You won't regret buying this book, believe me.

0380789035|3.0|British writer Neil Gaiman seems an unlikely candidate as one who would attempt a novel that seeks out the heart of America because he is not from here.  In American Gods, he introduces us to old gods and the modern technological gods of modern life.<br />Gaiman is experienced in the field of mythology as he has already written several novels pertaining to the topic.  He wrote The Sandman, a comic-book series, along with Good Omens, the dark fantasy Neverwhere, Smoke and Mirrors, a collection of short stories and poems, and Stardust.<br />American Gods revolves around Shadow on an adventure across America.  Shadow's name describes his character in that while he is likable, kind, and motivated by compassion, he is also troubled.  In effect he is a ghost, wondering without purpose.<br />After serving three years in prison for aggravated assault, Shadow is released to mourn the death of his wife, Laura, and best friend.  Homeless, wifeless, friendless, and jobless, Shadow finds his life nonexistent.  When a strange old man calling himself Wednesday offers Shadow a job as an errand boy, he has no reason not to accept.  Shadow spends much of his time wondering about his role in all this.  Laura's ghost comes to him several times and bails him out of trouble.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mystery in the form of fantasy.  And people who are interested in mythical gods can appreciate how they are represented in modern form in American Gods
B00003CXCT|1.0|GL shouldn't have messed with the original cuts of the movies.  It is impossible for me to watch these films now without my attention being instantly drawn to the changes, as opposed to getting \\"lost\\" in the excitement of the films.  And those changes by and large, are not improvements.  For one thing, Jabba (when Han steps on his tail) seems to have shrunk to about 2/3 of his size.  Ridiculous.  I'll not pain myself by describing the many other offences.<br />I'll not be buying these.

B000002LRX|5.0|FAITH NO MORE. The absolutely most influential and important hard rock band of the last 20 years, this is their greatest work. Angel Dust is the most amazing thing I have ever heard and the only album that can even come close is AiC's Dirt. Korn ripped them off. Disturbed ripped them off. Mushroomhead made an entire CAREER off one of these songs (check out \\"Jizzlobber\\" and tell me that every song on Mushroomhead's \\"XX\\" doesn't sound exactly like it. I dare you.) Each band member is a virtuoso on their instruments, but Mike Patton is the real star of this recording. Effortlessly jumping from operatic wails to death metal growl to bouncy rap to hilarious hick spoken word to lounge singing, this guy is absolutely amazing. He sounds like a different guy on each song. Who the hell else can pull that off? Another key player is Billy Gould and his amazing slap bass. Roddy Bottum holds each song together with his awesome atmospheric keyboard and this cd definetely wouldn't work without him. Here's a rundown of all the tracks:<BR>1.) Land of Sunshine: Dominated by keyboards and Patton's signature singing style, this is an awesome way to start off the album. 10/10<BR>2.) Caffeine: Awesome time changes and complete with a monkey chant in the beginning. Good, but one of the weaker tracks. 8/10<BR>3.) Midlife Crisis: Sick Melody, cool rapping parts, awesome drumbeat. Definetely a good pick for a single. 10/10<BR>4.) RV: Most people that own this cd hate this song but I think it's both hilarious and one of the stronger tacks. 10/10<BR>5.) Smaller and Smaller: One of the more death metalish songs. Sick time changes and awesome screaming. 10/10<BR>6.)Everything's Ruined: Never lets up and has an awesome keyboard. Has the best bassline on the cd. 9/10<BR>7.) Malpractice: If there's a filler on this cd, (there's not), this would be it. 8/10<BR>8.) Kindergarten: The CD is pure gold from here on out. Amazing song, awesome rapping. 11/10<BR>9.) Be Aggressive: One of the Best. Sick cheerleader chorus, awesome keyboard parts, and some pretty twisted lyrics. I SWALLOW! I SWALLOW! 12/10<BR>10.) A Small Victory: Amazing. 10/10<BR>11.) Crack Hitler: YES! TOp 3 songs of the cd, this one has it all. The only other track that comes close is....<BR>12.) Jizzlobber!!!!: Best Riff, Awesome Vocals, and inspired another awesome band single handedly( in my opinion, Mushroomhead). 13/10 ( 13/10 for Crack Hitler)<BR>13.) Midnight Cowboy: Sick Theme 10/10<BR>          I just can't say enough about this cd, you need it. absolutely. If you listen to any form of rock music, you can at least appreciate this. Some complain that it is too dark and inaccessible, but I disagree. If you buy FNM's cds in the correct order, you can crack 'em. Many say you should buy \\"The Real Thing\\" first, but I'd go with King for A Day. Not only will wading through this make Angel Dust instantly listenable, you'll also appreciate \\"TRT\\" more. Buy in this order: \\"King for A Day, Fool for a Lifetime\\", \\"The Real Thing\\", \\"Angel Dust\\", and then \\"Album of the Year\\". And if you like these four, try to find FNM's older album with Chuck Mosely as lead singer (introduce yourself). The two greatest hits and live collections are only for die hard fans, and if you can find the s/t be sure to pick that up. Everything Mike Patton touches is pure gold, so if you like FNM also check out: Dillinger escape plan, Tomahawk, Mr. Bungle, Fantomas, Peeping Tom, Maldoror, and all of his solo albums. Angel Dust is perhaps the best album ever made, and you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice if you didn't pick it up right now.
B00005JKG7|4.0|The Fog is not exactly a &quot;horror&quot; movie in the way most people think of them, and isn't that much like Carpenter's first hit Halloween.  Rather, it is a creepy and atmospheric ghost story filtered through Carpenter's unique perspective.  It won't scare the crap out of you or gross you out like The Thing, but it is consistently spooky and interesting, and looks way better than its microscopic budget should have allowed.  I don't think it quite measures up to Carpenter's best movies, but it is definitely worth a look.<br />The Special Edition DVD has a decent amount of extras, but the main benefit is the excellent picture quality and sound.  John Carpenter's commentary track is OK, but not as good as his ones on other films, especially the ones with Kurt Russel where he seems to have more fun and is more interesting.
B000002KDG|4.0|It's a raw sound, but full of emotion.  Young sings from the heart...he is not one of those high-image guys. What you see is what you get, and I would expect what you hear on this album is a good indicator of the energy one feels at a Neil Young concert. <br />He'll be rocking in the free world until he is 75!!
0385421982|5.0|John Grisham fans will not need to worry about being disappointed with this fast-paced thriller. The Pelican Brief, like many other novels that he has written is based on law. It has a thrilling plot and is suspenseful from the moment you lay your eyes on the first page. It will keep you reading into the small hours of the morning.<br />Most of Grisham's characters are related to law or to the government. Thomas Callahan is a professor at law, while Darby Shaw is a student of law. The rest of the characters are government officials and such.<br />The story begins with the murders of two supreme court justices. Supreme Court Justice Abe Rosenberg and Justice Glenn Jensen are both murdered on the same night by the same guy. Both murders where perfectly executed crimes. The murderer left no evidence and nothing for the government to pick up on.<br />After hearing about the murders, Darby Shaw gets quite interested decides to do some investigating of her own. After a few days of skipping classes and thorough research Darby put together a theory on what she found. She discarded it later on facts she thought proved it false. Thomas Callahan, a professor at Tulane, is having an affair with Darby. He takes her theory to an old friend in D.C. thinking it was ingenious. His friend, Gavin, thought it was amazing and sent it to the White house. It got to the president and eventually made its way outside of the White house.<br />When Thomas returned to Tulane, him and Darby went out to eat at a restaurant. Thomas got so drunk that Darby refused to ride with him. Thomas , being stubborn as he is, wouldn't let Darby drive and got in the car and when he started the engine a bomb went off. Darby hit her head on a bumper and got knocked out. While she was regaining consciousness a man dressed in a police uniform took her to a car asked her what her name was and then left her in the car. The police arrived soon after and found her lying there. The police deny that the man was part ofthe law enforcement.<br />The police took Darby to a nearby hospital and told her to wait there for help. She leaves when they are out of sight and gets a room at a hotel. She calls the only person she can think of at the moment, Gavin. She then finds out that she is a suspect at the murder of Thomas and the only person she can trust is his best friend.<br />This novel will take you through many twists and turns. It is gripping and will have you reading through to the very last word. Darby's theory has made someone very upset and they will go at all costs to have her executed. All Darby did was write down her best guess at the murders and now she is running for her life.

B00008NRLX|5.0|I bought this cd about a year ago, and I must have listened to it distractedly once, and then it got misplaced somewhere.  I have recently rediscovered it and it hasn't moved out of the cd player since.  I don't think I would be lying if I said this was the most heart-breakingly beautiful album I have ever heard.  Angelyne moves me to tears everytime I hear it.  The vocals and guitarwork throughout the whole album are magnificent.  This is an album I don't think I will tire of anytime soon.
B0000019PA|5.0|or perhaps it's more accurate to say that this album is the most hearbreakingly beautiful, charmingly awkward, and oddly poetic imperfection i have ever heard.<br />everyone must own this album, and if you don't like it right off, patience somehow lands you right in the middle of jeff mangum's landscapes, watching planes fly over oceans with him from anne frank's backyard. <br />honestly, i am in love. there's just no other way to say it.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I don't know how to explain it but, I just can't get into this new Slipknot.I'm all for new direction and the evolution of a bands sound but Vol 3(The Subliminal Verses) just sounds like it was mixed up with some Stone Sour tracks while Rick Rubin was mastering the tapes.<BR>And speaking of Rubin, who usually is a genius(SOAD Toxicity for one), but I wasn't impressed with the production of this disc, and like someone else said, the drums are kind of drowned out in the mix, save for the death march that occurs in &quot;The Blister Exists&quot;.<BR>I was under the assumption that Corey got the &quot;singing&quot; and acoustic thing out of the way with his other project, so when &quot;Circle&quot; starts to play, I'm a little confused as to it's purpose on the album.<BR>&quot;Duality&quot; is classic Knot but other songs don't stand out, there are alot of heavy riffs and PHENOMENAL Joey drumming on this cd &quot;Three Nil&quot; for example but nothing that stands out like those off of Iowa and the self titled cd.<BR>I bought it at Best Buy for $10 and I don't feel ripped off, I just was expecting more.<BR>I am basing this review off of only a couple of listens, but that's one more listen than your average critic would.<BR>So check it out before you make the purchase, it might even be one of those that grow on you in time.<BR>Let's wait and see.

1577311523|4.0|I learned a lot of wise advice from this book.  Overall it is well-written, although I disliked the question-answer format. I'd prefer a regular format, followed by question-answer sections in each chapter.  <br />I've never been exposed to such an emphasis on being in the moment. I have read up on Eastern wisdom, but have never experienced the point of being in the moment emphasized as vehemently as in this book.   In particular, the following idea resonated with me, a paraphrased epitome of the entire book:  anything we've ever experienced, or will experience, will happen in the now - therefore, resolve to live in the now, instead of the the imaginary abstractions of past and future. <br />There were however a few sections where Tolle seems full of it- especially sections where he restates a profound idea (obtained from elsewhere) without sufficient references to the source. His casual references to saints and prophets was also annoying. I objected to these, since it sounded like he perceived  the sources to be his peers. I prefer him to only focus on his concepts and stop sounding like he conceived the ideas, many of which he must've learned in traditional Eastern texts, without providing references.
B00009V8Z9|3.0|Most of the reviews for this album are five stars, so I'm expecting some people to click the \\"NO\\" button by looking at my rating alone. But anyway, the first time I ever heard of Gavin DeGraw was when I saw him on Last Call with Carson Daly (don't ask me why I was watching that). And his song \\"Follow Through\\" is pretty good, so I decided to see what his album, Chariot, was like.<br />There are some other good songs on here, like the title track and the song he has out now, \\"I Don't Want to Be\\". And when I looked at the lyrics to \\"Meaning\\", I said, \\"Oh boy, not another we-are-the-world song.\\" But that song actually works pretty well. My favorite song on the album, though, would have to be the smooth \\"More Than Anyone\\".<br />As far as the rest of the songs go, they leave something to be desired, especially the filler track \\"(Nice to Meet You) Anyway\\". \\"Chemical Party\\" and \\"Belief\\" have rather stupid lyrics, and \\"Just Friends\\" is fine until Gavin says something about that her body fits him like a glove.<br />I don't really Chariot is worth ALL the hype, but it's still a nice album to play to pass the time.<br />Anthony Rupert
6302752337|5.0|Revolutionary in its time but appearing somewhat dated now, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; was the ultimate road trip: two bikers on a cross-country ride from the west coast to Mardi Gras in New Orleans after scoring big in a drug deal.  Produced and directed by, and starring Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, and almost stolen by a then-unknown named Jack Nicholson playing a hippie lawyer, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; follows its two heroes across some of the most stunning scenery in the Southwest as they head towards Louisiana in search of &quot;freedom&quot;, whatever that means.  &quot;Easy Rider&quot; not only brings us two (or three, counting Nicholson) of society's dropouts, we also meet a community of hippies, some narrow-minded small-town lawmen, and some rednecks in Louisiana who seem to have a more-than-passing relationship to Neanderthals.  We wonder if the film's perhaps unwitting message is that the search for meaningless &quot;freedom&quot; results in meaningless and wanton death and destruction.  More than any film of its time, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; caught the mood of the late 1960s in America and the fear of the &quot;establishment&quot; for society's rebels.  It may be of its own time, but its timeless rejection of mindless conformity echoes down to us.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i've been waiting months for this album and i'm so glad that it finally arrived.  from start to finish, this album is incredible, not just as a rock/metal album but as a slipknot album as well.  you may attribute it to rick rubin who produced the album, or you can attribute it to the nine members acting in a cohesive unit again but either way, this is not an album to pass up on.  i heard a string instrument in their [a violin or a cello?], there's a piano, and a marching band's drum thrown in there.  if people were never going to change, we'd all be cavemen.  so for the people who believe an band can never change or else they sell out, maybe it's you who needs to evolve.  this album is a sonic masterpiece with some of the heaviest, some of the strangest, and some of the most beautiful musical elements i have heard this year so far.  and yes, corey taylor can still bite people's faces off, don't think the knot has gone &quot;sour&quot;.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|The anger set in first.  Today I'm still in denial.  I'm not sure if acceptance will ever come.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|To start off, don't go and buy this CD expecting Self Titled or Iowa. Slipknot has truley changed their sound. If your a hardcore fan of their old sound, it'll take some getting used to on this new CD. It took some getting used to for me, too, but now I beleive there change was for the better. <br />Prelude 3.0= Sounds like an intro title. But It's a really haunting song. 5/5<br />The Blister Exists= Heavy. Probably the heaviest one on the CD. Really shows how they can incorperate their new, very talented, sound into songs and still be heavy. 5/5<br />Three Nil= Another Heavy song, pretty fast and cool. 5/5<br />Duality= For some reason this song didn't strike me to much. It's like struggling between melodic and heavy and It just didn't work for me... 2/5<br />Opium of the People= SlipKnot+StoneSour. At least for the first couple riffs. All in all It's a pretty good song and really shows the drummer's excellent drumming abilitys. 5/5<br />Circle= WHOA! Acoustic Slipknot! A good song allthough it dosn't really strike me as a &quot;Slipknot&quot; style song. But w/e they want to do. The ending is really cool too. 4and a half/5 <br />Welcome= Another heavy song. Pretty good, too. 4/5<br />Vermillion= Interesting song... This again didn't hit me too much.  2/5<br />Pulse of the Maggots= Another good song. I like the live samples and intro. 4/5<br />Before I forget= The guitar is really good in this song. Allthough the strung out vocals in the verse's kind of get annoying. 4/5<br />Vermillion Pt. 2= ANOTHER Acoustic Song! This one is good too. But, again, dosn't seem very Slipknot like. 4/5<br />Nameless=Average song. 3 and a half/5<br />Virus of Life= Cool song. Reminds me of 'Scissors' off Their first album. 4/5<br />Danger-Keep Away= Serves as a good closing song. 4/5
1592400876|4.0|As one who was taught grammar the old-fashioned way by diagramming sentences in the fifth grade, I cringe every time I see such gems as \\"Every dog has it's day\\", signs advertising \\"apple's\\" and \\"orange's\\", the interminable misuse of their, there and they're, people acting like they never heard of past participles (a sign in a community center near my office exhorts the kids to \\"Stay strong, stay focus\\"), and the confusion of words that sound alike but mean totally different things, such as residents and residence.  Do residence live in the residents?  Believe it or not, I've actually seen this written.<br />One wonders if they actually teach grammar in the schools any more.  Given some of the notes I've read written by teachers to parents, it's doubtful.  I've seen teachers whose own grammar skills were so poor they wouldn't recognize the most flagrant grammatical errors if they were written in letters four inches high.  So Lynne Truss's book is long overdue for the hordes (not hoards) of the grammar-impaired.  (Yes, simply moving or omitting a comma can totally change the meaning of a sentence.  Try these three: \\"Eats, shoots and leaves\\"; \\"Eats shoots and leaves\\", and \\"Eats shoots, and leaves\\".)<br />The book is short, concise and very much to the point.  Unfortunately, it will probably be read and enjoyed only by those who already get the joke in the title.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|don't think that the knot has gone &quot;sour&quot;.  this album is a sonic masterpiece with some of the heaviest, some of the strangest, and some of the most beautiful musical elements i have heard this year so far.  attribute the sound to rick rubin who produced the album or to the nine band members acting cohesively again, but hands down this is one of the best rock/metal albums to be released all year.  corey's vocal style, a piano, some string instruments?, and definitely a marching band drum make this the most evolved slipknot sound.  some people may complain that the band are a bunch of sell-outs, however, humans were meant to evolve, or else we would still be cave men, so don't criticize them for evolving.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great book to read for high school kids.  I felt when I read it that I could relate a lot to Charlie the main character and books that allow you to feel what the character goes through are fun to read.  The whole story is really about Charlie growing up, experiencing every thing that a 15 year old would experience.  Charlie was a wallflower and it was good for me to see how other people who are totally opposite from me. But really the reason I liked this book is because I write just like Charlie, the way he uses his words and the way he writes. He writes the book as a journal using stream of consciousness. It was great to see how alike we write and that's why I liked this book so much.
B00020HEG6|5.0|This soundtrack is a whole different story compared to the other two Harry Potter soundtracks. It might be different but it is deffinatly awesome. The songs are very up-beat and moodier. This is one of the best soundtracks that John Williams has composed.
0385335482|5.0|I work in loans and had a customer recommend this book to me! I loved it and have passed in onto some coworker who also really enjoyed it too! This is a book for anyone that enjoys to shop and does not like to have debt! I never got into a character as much as I have with this series! When I finished this book I started searching for the next one in the series! I just started that one the other day and this evening already ordered the third book! I would recommend this to anyone!

B0000033WC|5.0|This album has the inexplicable experience of being labeled a flop by VU-philes.  The main reason I can imagine is that it diverted from the typical progressive-alternative-punk genre that had been laid down in the previous three albums.<br />But I can't see blaming it all on Doug Yule.  Yes, my loyalties lie with John Cale, but no one lambasts &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; (3rd album, 1st with Yule) as being a flop.  <br />Back on track, this is a good album, and it is filled with some catchy songs that are somewhat upbeat.  The most notable Reed creations are &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;Rock 'N' Roll&quot;, which are presented on the album....Sweet Jane in it's full (and only satisfactory) form.  <br />Those who have watched &quot;High Fidelity&quot; or listened to its soundtrack will recognize &quot;Who Loves The Sun&quot; and &quot;Oh, Sweet Nuthin!&quot;, and both are good songs.  &quot;Who Loves The Sun&quot; is a giddly little tune, but is surprisingly catchy.  The latter is a good &quot;sad&quot; song (it was used as such in the film), and has a good solo on Sterling's part towards the end.<br />Some say the middle songs on the album are &quot;filler&quot;, and at a first listen, they may seem so.  But after listening more and more, you will, in a way that only Lou Reed's songs can, be drawn into them.  &quot;New Age&quot; has grown on me, as well as &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Bill&quot;.  <br />But the most impressive &quot;filler&quot; track has to be &quot;I've Found A Reason&quot;.  Patterned after the old '50's rythym and blues songs, it is deceptively harmonic, soothing, yet rocking at the same time, and features great writing, both harmonically and lyrically, on Reed's part.<br />So, it doesn't deserve it's &quot;crap&quot; rating many give it.  But, which version to buy? <br />To me, there's not a question.  For a little more money (6 bucks at most), &quot;Fully Loaded&quot; gives you a ton of extra songs that are surprisingly substantiative tothe album itself.  To be fair, some of the tracks are demos, that either a. sound weird, or b. don't sound TOO much different, but there are some songs that never made it on the record at all.  Many ended up becoming solo Reed tracks later on, but hearing them in their original song formats are great.<br />Notables: &quot;Ocean&quot; is presented in a few varying forms on this album, which, in my opinion, is a suspenseful song, and keeps its charm well in these outtakes.  But the other highlight is &quot;I'm Sticking With You&quot;, led on vocals by drummer Maureen Tucker (YES, she does appear, but ONLY on &quot;Fully Loaded).  This version, unlike the one released on one of the &quot;lost MGM albums&quot; (&quot;Another View&quot; or &quot;VU&quot;), has an excellent acoustic guitar backing that gives it almost a folk feel, which suits the song better than the other (and more known) lounge-style accompianment.<br />All in all:<br />1.  &quot;Loaded&quot; was and is a viable album<BR>2.  Buy &quot;Fully Loaded&quot;, if considering buying &quot;Loaded&quot; to begin with.<br />The &quot;Fully Loaded&quot; variant is filled out with the extra tracks, and also allows you to compile some demo tracks without having to buy the boxed set.<br />Reccomended.
0064471837|5.0|This book is truly remarkable in the complex world it creates. The reality is confusing at first, but Garth Nix has a skill like no other author I have read besides Frank Herbert in his Dune series, to explain an intricate concept without just sitting down and telling the reader straight out. Captivating for any age this book went right around my school (ages 10 to 15) and then circulated among a few of the parents. Several younger kids enjoyed the thrill of having this book read to them as well.<br /> An inspiring fantasy book that never grows old.<br />-Herm

B00005JKQZ|4.0|I didn't know much about Nash or his theories before watching this movie, and while I'm aware that the movie isn't a 100% accurate picture of his life, A Beautiful Mind still tells a beautiful story. Ron Howard does an excellent job at conveying the difficulty of distinguishing reality from delusion and the frustration that Nash and Alicia went through. Both Russel Crowe and Jennifer Conolly put in great performances, especially Russel Crowe. He is incredible to watch in this film; he brings intensity to Nash's character and portrays the changes in mannerisms flawlessly. The supporting cast is also effective and the whole movie was shot beautifully. Overall, it was thought provoking, moving, and very interesting to watch. Definitely worth it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I thought she was an amzing artist when she came out with 'Let Go'... she has out-done herself! Every song on this album songs like it belongs, it makes a perfect mix! Every song is written well and easy to sing along to. Mature lyrics like 'Nobody's Home' and 'Fall to pieces' make this cd amaing... it still has its chatchy Hits....&quot; My Happy Ending&quot; and &quot;Freak Out&quot;. I have soo much respect for this girl!! She proves that a girl can be B E A U T I F U L  without being a skank! Go Avril! You really are all grown up! I love you! Keep Rocking with GOOD CHARLOTTE, baby! haha Im done.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|For those viewers who believe former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara is the \\"villian\\" of Vietnam, get ready to reasses that perhaps unfair viewpoint. This film by Errol Morris makes both a detailed and at the same time, a \\"big-picture\\" view of McNamara's career that may cause even the most strident anti-McNamara demonstrator to convert. Told with a remarkable tenderness and an eye towards history, this work shows McNamara as he would undoubtedly have been portrayed had he not been involved with Vietnam, which is to say a brilliant, thoughtful and sensitive government servant who deserves history's nod as one of (if not THE) most influential Defense Secretaries, possibly even Cabinet members in our history.<br />The film shows historical footage of McNamara as JFK's Defense Secretary being asked his opinion on the then accepted view of him as a \\"know-it-all\\" who never makes mistakes and presents a rather smug attitude to all who question him. His answer is surprising and humble and this clip sets the tone for the entire movie. Basically, this is a video interview with the now 85 year old McNamara, interspersed with many films and video spots from his long history in the Kennedy and Johnson Cabinet. What's surprising (and a welcome diversion) is how much is revealed of RSM on a personal level. Topics such as his parents, his mentors from his military service (he served in the Air Force during WWII), his personal relationship with his wife and children and heretofore little known intimate dealings with Kennedy and Johnson make this work much more than just a documentary. These topics, told in the unique McNamara voice style (an educated \\"frog-like\\" sound) carry a powerful dialectic which naturally drags the viewer along. I'd wager (as I've previously mentioned) that even the people that hate him the most will still enjoy viewing this to see what the REAL McNamara is about.<br />Major historical milestones such as the perceived missile gap with the Soviet Union at thestart of the Kennedy administration, the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis and of course the initiating events in Vietnam are covered by McNamara with a clarity and forthrightness that has seemingly characterized his post-government career. \\"Matter-of-fact\\" recounting's of decisions relating to troop enlargements and bombing plans in Vietnam are explained with contriteness and epitomizes RSM's rationale for his actions in this period...he was simply an important government official who's duty it was to advise the President on military matters. Indeed, the oblique \\"domino-theory\\" was his reasoning for the escalation there and he now lectures us on how not only that policy was wrong, but that the goverment should have more thoughtfully reappraised it's actions taken there. Portraying a surprising humility, McNamara now talks about how precious life is and how regretful his whole involvement was in Vietnam. At the same time, he still refuses to go into any great detail explaining some specific events, sighting the continued controversy that still surrounds his tenure in the government.<br />His career and some initiatives as President of the World Bank are covered and McNamara is humerous in his acceptance of the fact that he was \\"fired\\" by Johnson for voicing his realization of the ineptness of the situation in Vietnam. The strongest points of this DVD (in my opinion) are in the Special Features section...here we see the \\"cut\\" sequences where he deals with Kennedy and Johnson on a personal level and this more than anything else adds the depth to this work that really makes it stand out.<br />Whether you love him or hate him, you'd have to agree that McNamara was exceedingly influential in his term at the Pentagon and has continued it in his post-government career. This film sort of vindicates him (at least in my viewing) for those famous \\"international misunderstandings\\" (the domino theory) and provides an important history \\"bridge\\" between that seminalperiod and now...certainly still a point in history that continues to be an important lesson for today's government officials and a work worthy of the Academy Award.
B00005AR3G|5.0|When I was a kid, Disney's movies were enjoyable for me to watch, but not really funny (the \\"Little Mermaid\\" is a good case in point-I love the movie, but there was little ha-ha humor in there.) But, over the years Disney has slowly gotten funnier; they had already perfected the dramatic moments. Now, you have to look at each movie individually. \\"Aladdin\\" was meant to be mostly funny, which is why they contracted Robin Williams to play a major part. Likewise, \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\" was meant to send you into giggles at random moments, and it is my opinion that the gargoyles and Phoebus pulled that off perfectly. But \\"Pocahontas\\" and \\"The Lion King\\" were mainly dark, introspective-sort of pieces. Some humor, but when you have star-crossed lovers in the midst of a war and a sympathetic character death, the humor is lost.<br />However, the \\"Emperor's New Groove\\" is a laugh riot. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard at a Disney movie. Even though he spends most of the film as an absolute jerk and a spoiled brat, Kuzco is absolutely tongue-in-cheek hilarious. And the witch and her henchman had me holding my sides several times. Even Pacha's family was funny! I especially love his wife-she was really on top of things, even though she was pregnant and trying to control two small children and help outwit the bad guys. <br />The animation is superb! The colors are bright and clear, and the movements are very fluid. I had to suspend belief with the llama's movements, but he was a talking llama, so who am I to say that he can't sit like that or walk on two legs. <br />The voices were entirely appropriate to the character; Disney did a fantastic casting job. John Goodman did an excellent job with the calm, down-to-earth llama herder Pacha, David Spade is probably the only one who could have pulled off Emperor Kuzco, and Earth Kitt was the perfect choice for the put-upon, cynical advisor Yzma. <br />All in all, this movie is another in a very long line of Disney Greats.
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration is the best album I know of by The Cure.  That's not to say there is not a better one (though I doubt there is) -- just that I am not a dyed-in-the-wool Cure fan.  This album has already been praised in superlatives by painted-up goths, and scorned ruthlessly by guys who listen only to Slayer and Pantera.  I'm not writing to do either of those things.<br />And while I can easily listen to this entire CD nonstop for a day or so, I think it is worthwhile to point out the specifics of what makes it great.  Many people are already familiar with &quot;Lovesong,&quot; a quick, apparently cheerful testimonial of complete adoration.  And while its radio-friendly rhythm runs contrary to the rest of the songs on Disintegration, compulsive study reveals the core of &quot;Lovesong&quot; to be anything but happy.  It is in actuality three minutes and thirty seconds of obsession and desperation, the tale of a soul so empty that it can only find meaning and shape in the image of another, idealized person.  It might be one of the best pop singles of all time, not only because it is catchy and fun to sing along with, but because it is complex enough that it means different things to so many different listeners.  The fact that it stands in such stark contrast with many of the other songs on the album suggest that it is, perhaps, the saddest of all of them, just in its own hidden, extremely vulnerable way.  I've heard the recent cover of &quot;Lovesong&quot; on the radio, and I think it fails at least in part because the pace has slowed down so much.  The fast, desperate beat is exactly what made the lyrics so poignant in the first place.<br />The other track that really makes this album is &quot;The Same Deep Water As You.&quot;  I can think of no other song that so completely transports the listener to another place, another mood, another day, awash in a cold gray rain and steeped in the tranquil misery of a dying relationship.  The muffled thunder that heralds beginning and end, the melancholy guitar solos that punctuate throughout like a reflection warped by the surface of a rippling lake, the surging synth notes that drench the whole scene in a sense of finality, all contribute to what must be the most affecting breakup song of all time.  &quot;The Same Deep Water As You&quot; will seem ridiculous to some people, but it isn't for them; it is an epic mourning, a lamentation, and it can't be understood by people who don't experience breakups intensely.  But if it catches you, you may find yourself listening to it repeatedly -- much like the rest of Disintegration.<br />Best listened to on, yes, a rainy day, with some incense lit, and the lights out.ning and end, the melancholy guitar solos that punctuate throughout like a reflection warped by the surface of a rippling lake, the surging synth notes that drench the whole scene in a sense of finality, all contribute to what must be the most affecting breakup song of all time.  &quot;The Same Deep Water As You&quot; will seem ridiculous to some people, but it isn't for them; it is an epic mourning, a lamentation, and it can't be understood by people who don't experience breakups intensely.

B0000CAQ26|4.0|When I First heard that Pink had a new album in stores I was very specticle.Her Last Album &quot;Mizzunderstood&quot; took a very long time for me to get used to.But I kept in mind that the &quot;Cant Take Me Home&quot; Pink was not her at all.Once I got passed the Rock&amp;Roll/Punk sound.I finally noticed this is the real deal.This is not &quot;Pink&quot; per say but this is Phelica Moore.She's actually talking about something other than the usual &quot;you Did me wrong I want you dead and your girlfriend out my bed&quot; songs.<br />   When I heard Try This being used to the new and real Pink,I understood this album and it's sound.I actually loved this album.If she didn't prove her vocal abillity on &quot;Lady Momerlaud&quot;<BR>then she most definetly proved it on this album.With such songs as &quot;God Is a Dj&quot; sparking some contriversey and &quot;Unwind&quot;,where Pink strikes a very noticable vocal simularity with the great lengend Janic Joplin.The is even aparently suppose to be baised around the original white girl with soul,the legend miss Janic Joplins life.I wouldnt be surprised it's known that Pink is a huge Janic Joplin fan,and not by many but that next summer of 2005 Pink will be portreying the legend in a biopic of her life.Even though Rene Zellwegger will also in the highly anticipated &quot;Piece Of My Heart&quot; (Witch is a Janic Joplin song,for those who dont know).<br />   But all in all Pink proves with this album that she is and will always be a force to be recond with.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|I bought Avril's first cd and loved it, so first day released I bought her 2nd album. I think it is my favorite cd. The lyrics reach out to me and I feel like she knows what I am thinking sometimes. She did a great job on the cd and I can't wait to see some more of her work in the future.
B00008YJHC|5.0|This album was my formal introduction to a band that largely set the stage for the grunge generation of bands that followed after they disbanded in 1992, only to get back together in 2004 for the Coachella festival.<br />Though the comparison is a bit far fetched at times, for the most part, Pixies' 'Bossanova' makes me think of a raw Talking Heads (think &quot;All Over The World&quot; and &quot;Dig for Fire&quot;), showered with a shoegazing sound of sorts, such as the case of the closing track &quot;Havalina&quot; (my favorite in the album). There's plenty more great songs, like the brilliant &quot;Rock Music&quot; where the unsettling screaming goes in hand with the guitar riffs to deliver one solid album opener (though it's song #2, it feels as if the album doesn't start until you get to it), and the college classic, &quot;Velouria&quot;, which is to say that this is one album that deserves close attention and listening.<br />Though for most newcomers into their music, you might not find the album to sink in after just one listening, the true downside of the album is the short length of most of the songs, many of which don't even live to see the 3-minute mark. Definitely leaves you wanting more, after a few listens.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|After hearing the album (and seeing them live), I must say this is defintely their best album. Every track on here is incredible. It's not old Slipknot but it's not BAD slipknot. It's new and improved Slipknot. The only people that won't like this album will be the &quot;KIDS&quot; that only listen to that @&amp;!$ty metal that the same 20+ bands have the same drum beat for every song, and album along with the same @!$%ty vocals (I.E. Cannibal Corpse, Vile, Exhumed, Six Feet Under, etc.). This masterpiece was created for the &quot;True Maggots&quot;, not the 13-15 year old posers.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I would have not bought this album if I had a chance to (legally) listen to the whole thing first.<br />This album may be good in its own right, perhaps by another band or even as a side project, but I enjoy Slipknot for their style of brutality and this was such a major disappointment.  A little change or experimentation is good although this is just too much.  Also, the sound production is way overdone (mainstreamed, radio-friendly, or whatever you want to call it) for my taste but this may not bother most people.<br />I would return the CD if it were possible.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|After hearing this album (and seeing them live) I was struck with &quot;Aww&quot;. The songs on here are freakin' awesome. It's not normal slipknot, but it's not BAD slipknot. This is by far the best album they've put out so far. The only people that won't like this album are the &quot;kids&quot; who are close minded and probably only listen to metal that the same 6+ bands have the same drum beat every song, on every album (I.E. Cannibal Corpse, Vile, Exhumed, Six Feet Under, etc.). I loved the acoustic songs, and the heavy songs. This is their masterpiece for us the &quot;True Maggots&quot;.

6305922756|5.0|Hilarious!  I too was curious about the difference between this special edition and the criterion version, so I did a little internet research and found an entire page devoted to this question.  [...]<BR>Read it and you decide. I'm going with the Special.  Hope this helps.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I found this CD to be fantastic. The music is perfect! It really gets me in the mood for the film (not that it took much :P). My favourite track has to be &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, the choir song that can be heard in most of the film's trailers. I highly recommend getting this if you enjoy this type of music, a must have for your collection.
B0000024K1|4.0|Well this cd presents the dualities of rap: great flow and great beats and complete obnoxiousness. Both rappers Flavor Flav and Chuck d are obviously very talented and deserve more recognition than they get, unfortunately Flavor can get really annoying for example the yeah in Don't Beleive the Hype becomes rather irratating rather quickly. However the colloboration with Anthrax shines as a skillfully mixed combination of rap and metal. Songs like She watch Channel Zero and Rebel Without a Pause are true rap classics that mix superb music with a social message. Chuck D does say some somewhat racist things like &quot;selling drugs to the brother man instead of the other man&quot; which can be turn off for some but hilarious for others. Overall this is a seminal rap album but some songs can be easily skipped over.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I think this album is by far one of the best metal albums that I've heard in a long time. Yeah it's a different style then Slipknot has been known for but I think it's a good thing. The entire album seems to flow together so easily that it almost seems like one big song. I do especially like how the lighter songs are blended in with the heavier ones. It kind of keeps you on your toes while you're listening. The guitars in this album are awesome. It almost reminds of the old school metal bands that relied more on heavy guitar solos then anything. Joey is of course still one of the best drummers in the business. All in all this album is definately a bit different then usual but if you are a die hard maggot then it doesn't matter. Besides it's good to have a change of pace once in a while.
0385336810|4.0|I love the Shopaholic series and I was extremely excited for this book.  And I wasn't disappointed.  I still love the Shopaholic series, but I loved this book even more.  I liked that it was more about relationships and less about financial turmoil.  I felt stressed out for Becky Bloomwood.  Emma is more assertive and finally gets to speak out for herself.  I loved all the characters in this book and I could match them up with people in my life, so it made it that much better.  Everyone knows someone who displays similiar characteristics of Artemis, Jemima and awful cousin Kerry.  <br />Is this book fun and probably a bit unrealistic?  Definitely.  Is that part of the reason I love it.  Absolutely.  It made me chuckle.  It was a great distaction from everyday life.  And true to her form, Sophie Kinsella leaves us asking for more.  Oh and for anyone who might be interested, I heard that they were going to turn this into a movie that is due out sometime next year with Kate Hudson as Emma.  I hope it does justice to the book.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|So Slipknot decides to do something different and a lot of people go crazy...sorry to those of you that can't adapt to a little change, but after all, it would get old if Slipknot did the 'Self-Titled'/'Iowa' thing everytime out now wouldn't it?!  With this being said...'Vol. 3' absolutely kicks @ss.  Yes, it is different, and the same thing over and over and over would get old and worn out...compare it to something simple like eating the same thing everyday your whole life...now would you get sick of that??  This new Slipknot CD is brilliant, brutal, but at the same time beautiful.  Corey shows more dynamicness in his voice, the guitar work of Mick and Jim are better than ever, Joey's drums are still kicking...just everything about this CD is much more dynamic and perfected (that's a scary word, but it's not a bad thing in this case whatsoever).  Not a track on this album is bad at all.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion...This is just mine...I'm going to be a Slipknot fan no matter what...Slipknot is reborn in 2004, and I'm proud to say that the new album simply put...IS ABSOLUTELY AN AMAZING MASTERPIECE...<br />(SIC) 4/EVER!!!
B00007LTIA|5.0|Im not gonna make this long. This is my favorite Yes album by far and one of my favorite albums ever. All the songs are absolutely stunning and beautiful. There's not one second that is out of place or dragged on in my opinion at least. Some of Yes' best work. I dont understand why some people are bashing it so much here. This is a truly amazing peice of work and it deserves just as much (if not more) credit than Close to the Edge, Relayer, or Fragile. Way more than Fragile actually. Dont get me wrong, those albums are phenominal. But this album just puts all of those to shame. With CTTE in a close second. But again, this is just my opinion. It has everything that i love in Yes and in prog rock in general. It's just great.
B00008LDPU|5.0|It is rather chilling to see how much more entertaining and dynamic the Matrix storyline is in the hands other film makers. Thou direct connections to the theatrical movies of the series are sparse, the Animatrix takes the Matrix concept to those risky limits we caught a glimpse of in the original. These self-contained stories give the audience different views of the Matrix, showing how it can be an interesting medium for a variety of stories. If there is any effort to further the Matrix series, I hope the producers have the sense to put it in the hands of one of these filmmakers instead of the Wachowskis.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is awesome. As if Slipknot could disappoint.  Not like the other albums though...my wife even likes this one.  Very heavy at times, but also mellow. Seems more technical than the past albums.  Worth every penny you'll pay for it. Buy it!!
B00003CXBK|3.0|Great visuals, stunning animation, but the plot felt muddled at times. It is interesting and takes risks in its chosen method of storytelling, but I was cringing at certain moments toward the later part of the film.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This musical is another Stephen Shwartz masterpiece. I purchased the musical because it was nominated for TEN Tony Awards, and rightfully so. Then I was delighted to find that Idina Menzel was in it, a favorite of mine since Rent. I loved it immediately; it's a powerful musical, with breathtaking harmonization and chord architecture.<br />This is a musical person's musical, not a musical for fans of the book Wicked. To clarify, this is BASED on the book. It is an adaptation, and an open adaptation at that. If you are looking for the book set to music, don't buy it because it's not accurate (and not meant to be).<br />But, if you love musicals, and love Stephen Shwartz's previous work (Pippin, Godspell) PURCHASE this musical. You will not regret it. It deserves all of its Tony nominations, and I'll be rooting for it on June 6th!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I have a certain pet peeve about seeing a story through to its ending. Even if the plot starts to go sour, I want to see how the storytellers wrap things up. The Matrix began so strongly with such great, inventive ideas, you would expect the final installment to at least attempt to offer a satisfying conclusion to the tale.<br />But sadly you get more of a pause then a resolution. In short, nothing changes. There is no real development or evolution of the store. The characters simply perform their appointed duties and the world does NOT change. The status quo remains with little hope that anything tangible has resulted from all this fuss.<br />This movie is cryptically open ended when it should not be. The point of a story is bring the audience to a new place, a new revelation that is a direct result of the actions taken by the characters in the store. This movie fails to do this in every way possible, though it attempts to give the appearance being the final act.<br />Don't be surprised if somewhere down the line, yet another Matrix movie is released, possibly straight to video or at least in the hands of a lower budget studio.
B00008BXJF|5.0|This is the best King Crimson album since Red.  Unlike other album efforts since the mid seventies, this album works as a cohesive whole.  It's a 45-minute journey into chaos, destruction, Armageddon and ultimately redemption.  Drummer Pat Mastellato is a mad scientist who uses trick effects and bone shattering power to drive things forward.  Rush's Neil Peart and Led Zeppelin's John Bonham definitely come to mind.  But he is in no way derivative and can back up his special effects with power and technique.  Once I've recovered from this album, I'm looking forward to viewing the double DVD live set.
B00005MAM2|3.0|To do the lengthy Akira graphic novel series complete justice would require a Peter Jackson-like effort in a series of movies. Nonetheless, this anime does a decent job of taking us into the world of Neo Tokyo. Much oif the overall story is missing, but I did love the direction of this film. <br />I saw this movie when it was first released in the US years ago and even today I still fondly recall those flashback scenes of Tetsuo and Kaneda growing up together, best friends always, yet doomed to their tragic conflict.<br />I'm the kind of fan who always opts to watch anime in the original Japanese with English subtitles. You get more of the intended emotions from the voice actors that way I find.<br />Past editions of Akira in English were down right boring because of the dubbing. The new edition is better, but I still prefer to watch it in Japanese.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|J'ai trouvé l'album très décevant à la première écoute.  Mais plus souvent l'écoute est, meilleur est le cd ;-).. Je suis persuadé que lorsqu'ils viendront en show, le monde respectera plus ce troisieme album.  Mais je suis d'accord avec le fait qu'il fait un peu stone sour par moment mais en général, les tounes sont quand meme assez heavy (3NIL, Opium for the people).<br />Mais bon, c mon opinion.. je ne peux attendre leurs retours a montreal..
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended edition of Two Towers adds much more depth to the Lord of the Rings experience. Gondor, Denethor, Boromir and Faramir are much more fleshed out here, making the subesequent final installment of the series that much more enjoyable. <br />Most of the additional footage is scattered throughout the film as scene extensions. But the flashback to Osgilliath is the longest of the deleted scenes. It cements the demeanor of Gondor and its line of stewards. I felt more sympathy for Boromir and Faramir after watching this scene. It captured how much they love their country and the lengths they would go to serve Gondor. The scene made me think back to how vehement Boromir was in Fellowship and how insane Denethor was in Return of the King.  I can only hope the extended Return of the King DVD has as much additional, character developing footage.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I'm sure I'll repeat most of what has already been said here, but all in all - this cd was disappointing. This album is Slipknot's &quot;Load&quot; as I saw in another review. While I liked &quot;Load&quot;... it wasnt the Metallica, and same with this album &amp; Slipknot. I've given it several runs and I will say I do like it.... I'll say I wasnt looking for an exact replica of their first 2 albums, but to me, that is Slipknot, this is not. Yes yes, its great that &quot;all 8 members had input&quot; on this one, but it no longer feels like the band I swore by for years. I found so much non-mainstreamed anger and new unique personality in S/T &amp; Iowa, I found them expressing all the hatred, anger and aggression I felt, and I *loved* it (Made me want to funk some shizzle up, you know?). I also very much enjoyed Stone Sour's debut album - but I like these bands separately. Metallica did it, Staind did it, 40 Below Summer did it, Flaw did it, (Who else?) but I never expected Slipknot to do it. Maybe the primary members responsible for their first 2 albums will branch off into yet another Slipknot spin-off and pick up where Iowa left off. Lets cross our fingers.
B00005JLEU|5.0|It's not often that I enjoy anime dubbed in English. But Spirited Away was such a fine film, I enjoyed it in every language. I was captivated and drawn into this tale like the child I used to be.
0440234743|4.0|To start with, I take issue to annmason1, who wrote the review &quot;Hogie Sandwhich&quot;.  She obviously has trouble with Grisham and his stories...why read him if you have so many hangups with the man's talent? I also must add that hogies down here in the south must be MUCH different than they are in the pacific northwest, because here in Dixie we pile on the meat.<BR>And to be honest, southern-boy John Grisham did the same in this book-piled on the meat.  I won't go so far as to say this is better, or even in the ballpark, with &quot;The Firm&quot; and &quot;Pelican Brief&quot;, but it is on par with &quot;The Client&quot;, &quot;The Chamber&quot;, and &quot;Runaway Jury&quot;.  <BR>There are moments in the book, as there are in ANY book, that people will look at as nothing but filler (or bread, as it where, since we are on this sandwhich kick at the moment).  But as a whole, the story is well-written, superbly laid out, and flows easily from beginning to end.  <BR>If only ALL hogies sandwhiches could say that...
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Very dissapointing.  Slipknot used to be heavy, now they sound like Stone Sour.  Where's the anger in Coreys vocals? There's nothing like Heretic Anthem, or any of the good old songs on this album.  There are only three good songs here.  If I wanted to hear crap like this, I'd listen to Radiohead.
0061015725|4.0|Crichton is the master of showing us the dire consequences of man playing God.  This book is a thrilling ride, and superbly gives us a glimpse of some of the possible dangers of both nano-technology, and computers that can think and learn for themselves.  This book is fast-paced, exciting, and seems ready-made for conversion to the silver screen.  I wouldn't be surprised at all to see this one become a movie, or at least a cheasy television mini-series.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Under My Skin is similar to Avril's first CD, Let Go, so if you liked that you'll probably like this. It's a bit more evolved and grown up, and is better in my opinion. The songs are more diverse and you never really feel like you're listening to the same thing over and over again. Overall a very good CD, highly recommended :)
0440211727|5.0|This is not just a book, it is a spectacle to behold.  I was literally biting my nails as this book reached its climax, as Clanton, Mississppi, a small unsuspecting southern town becomes the home of the biggest trial in the nation.  The racial tension is this book is palpable, and it is the driving force behind what makes this story so compelling. This small town becomes a virtual war zone.  Fantastic!  I can't even find the words to describe how amazing and unbelievable a read this was!
B000002H33|5.0|i love every single track on this album.the best song is-disposable heroes. it kicks major A$$!!!! DH is like judas priests \\"metal meltdown\\" it just makes you want to punch somebody! go out and buy it now! hey isnt pogo BIG @$$.
0385510438|3.0|This is a much watered down Clanton adventure.  I really enjoyed the characters of Willie Traynor and Miss Callie, and this was really more a story of their relationship than anything.  The Padgit fiasco was definately interesting, but the ending is less than spectacular.  A good book by Grisham, though definately not his best.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|One aspect of Slipknot that attracted me the most to them was the hardcore, loud, passionate (filled with hatred and anger) metal sound. This is the ideal Slipknot, it's what us maggots have come to love and enjoy... and need.<br />Volume 3: (the Subliminal Verses), fails to capture that essence. Rather it's been lost in a persuit for a &quot;new,&quot; &quot;perfected&quot; sound. Yes, change is good at times, but in this case it's inappropriate.<br />A few songs, mellow songs, are descent, and I must give them credit for that. I'm not asking for a new &quot;Slipknot&quot; or &quot;Iowa,&quot; but I'm also not asking for a new band either, this is was Slipknot has become. They've lost something.<br />I am a fan, a maggot, and proud to be one, and I'll stand behind them, but am I dissapointed... yes.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|To stay alive, a band has to evolve.  Sometimes the risk of evolution ruins a band...this is NOT one of those evolutions. Although this album does not have the raw, ball crunching, uncontrollable anger of the previous albums, this owns up to a new darker power.  Its true deep human emotion grips a new part of the psyche that Slipknot has not evoked before.  It is true that the music is more &quot;radio acceptable&quot; but that does not mean it sucks.  If you are one of those persons who believe that a band should not change, then do not buy this album, but if you want to risk a little change, then do.
006016848X|4.0|This will not be a professional critique, simply my opinion. I am almost done with the book and I love it and have learned SO much. As a woman, I was surprised to learn some things about men that seem so plain when spelled out in the way they were. Now I feel like &quot;I get it&quot; in a general way. As I read, I thought &quot;OH! so THAT'S why he did that...&quot;. It has improved my confidence and &quot;validated&quot; my behaviour in my own relationship. Yes, I have been doing the right thing, as unsure as I was at the time. As for the non-supporters of this book, if you are not willing to give in a relationship then this book, and possibly a healthy relationship just isn't for you! We need to cooperate and accept each other and if you are dead set on things being on your terms all the time, you will certainly not benefit from this book. This book should be required reading for all, in my opinion. It's not the answer, but boy does it help unlock some mysteries and help us to realize the differences. Stereotypical as they may be at times, there is a reason for it. We came from a time when what we now refer to as sterotypes was the norm and we are still the same people just trying to grow and successfully cross those lines. We can't fight our own biology and chemicals, so embrace it and do your best to understand the basic nature of it. We ARE different, and much more than I had realized before opening this book. Give the love that you feel you deserve. Compromise and understanding are two words that can help sum this book up. Unfortunately I do not think very many single men will be reading this book on their own and I am certainly not about to suggest it to my boyfriend (because of many reasons explained in the book!) but maybe I can put my newfound knowledge of men to work and convey some of what I have learned to him in a way that will help him to understand me as I have learned to understand him better. If you are a single man who has taken it upon himself to read this book, then GOOD JOB from this Venusian! Thanks for reading my opinion!o read this book, then GOOD JOB from this Venusian! Thanks for reading my opinion!

B0000AXE8I|3.0|I loved the Matrix.  Reloaded is just \\"ok\\".  The action was good enough.  The big disappointment for me was Zion.  The scenes with people dancing, with loving close-ups of dirty feet squishing in the mud, made me wonder if the directors have a foot fetish.  It was really annoying!  But the ending at least made me interested in the 3rd installment.

B00009TB5G|5.0|This is easily my favorite movie of all time, and I've been alive for over 30 years now.  I will never get tired of watching this.  Lose ends are tied up nicely in the extended edition.  A real treat.  The battle scenes are some of the most amazing ever.  The director outdid himself.  Bravo!

0385336810|4.0|&quot;Can You Keep a Secret&quot; was a VERY light and funny read. Emma Corrigan is a sweet and simple woman who has a &quot;few&quot; secrets that she keeps from all of the important (and not so important) people in her life. She meets a handsome American man on a plane who she rambles all of these secrets to -- without realization -- because the plane hits a little turbulence and she truly believes that he is the last person that she will ever see. When she lands safely and realizes that she still has her life, she is embarassed, but convinces herself that she will never see this man again  -- WRONGO!<br /><br />  Unfortunalty not long after that mortifying scenario,Emma comes in contact with this man, who unfortunatly is someone very important and holds a high position for the company that she works for. Everything seems to go downhill for her after that point as she runs into comical circumstance after circumstance.<br />I thought that this book was hilarious, but NOT at all as witty as the Shopaholic Series.<br />  The ending of &quot;Can You Keep A Secret&quot; left me a little disappointed because I felt that it was a bit rushed. I also wanted to know more about how Emma's relationship with her parents was progressing. Overall, it wasn't a waste of money and would definatly recommend it for a day at the spa or beach. Enjoy! :)
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Like everyone else has said, I know bands change and thier styles change as well.......but this is not SLIPKNOT! Slipknot was the band I could turn to when I was upset about something and channel my anger to singing along with it, or something. I still like this CD, its good.........but totally not what I was expecting. It defenitly wasn't like Iowa which when I first popped into my CD player I set it full blast and loved every second. I'm sorry to say but the new Korn CD is more cutting edge then Slipknot's. I never thought I'd see the day....but Korn's new album has much more emotion. I think thats what this Slipknot CD is lacking, emotion.<br />Slipknot was born in Iowa by a bunch of kids/guys who were pissed off fro mbeing restrained with everything and wrote creative, awesome music. This album sounds like it was written by some guys who tasted fame and tried to hard to get back thier roots.<br />Don't get me wrong, the music is great........but not what I wanted to hear from the Knot.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|L j'ai de la misre  comprendre: Slipknot on puis leur talent aprs seulement 2 albums qui m'ont fait tout simplement jubiler pour en venir  un sorte de Stonesour. Le tout reste un peu aggressif, mais je m'attendais  de nouveaux riffs speeds et lourds. Je vous recommande de faire comme le cd de Limp Bizkit (aaaaark): achetez le premier album, point final.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|The first two Slipknot albums rocked.   This one is the best by far.   Slipknot takes some heroic risks on this album and I'm blown away impressed... Their new music is genius.   There is an incredible amount of quality and attention to detail in their writing and musicianship.   The contrast of anger, melody, rage, and harmony is so freaking cool.   Bow down.   Believe.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|This album is weak - sorry to dissapoint the fans...such as myself - who loved the powerful hard energy that the first two albums had....This album is soft.  My best analogy if how Limp Bizkit was hella hard and awesome on their first album (3 Dollar Bill Yall) to the weakness of their latest album....Thats all I gotta say..<BR>I wanted this CD to pump me up like the older ones. But that didnt happen.<br />This album is definetely not worth the 11 bucks I payed for it...<BR>If you want something hard more 'like' the old Slipknot then go buy KORN's 'Take a Look In the Mirror' CD! Thats a f...in awesome CD.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I'm not close minded to a band expanding there horizons, but this album is the exact opposite out that.  It is completly uninspired and instantly forgettable.  Previous Slipknot albums had both heavy and mello elements but they always inspired strong emotion. This album is conventional radio fodder.  Most great bands put out at least one crap album, hopefully Slipknot got it out of they're system and they'll come back in a couple years and put out more great material.
B000002LIX|5.0|This album is just magic i mean it is so excellent. It really is the epitome of alternative. Perry's vocals are just so melodic and beautiful.Dave Navarro's psychedelic solo's and guitar playing just add to the bands brilliance. Its a shame that Eric Avery left because he is a legend. This is very differant to 'strays' because this is more melodic and raw. I highly recommend this album for it inspired me in so many different ways.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I'll keep this simple.  When I first listened to this CD, I was awestruck, then scared.  I sing for a band called Crude Ocean and this style of metal is exactly what we are about to release. (Hence why so many people like our sound, it's very different...)  It looks as if Slipknot kind of beat us to it. <br />The blend between heaviness and samples with a thin accoustic lining making an unbelievable art form that can captivate you or make you demolish all the glass objects you own.  Put it this way, this is some of the best art that has been released in the past couple years now for Metal.  Once people stop thinking about the bands past records and really focus on what they have now created, I think a lot of people are going to realize how awesome it really is.  <br />I don't give it 5 Stars because I like the album, I give it five stars because it's truly nothing short of a masterpiece.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|As an equal new metal fan (I refuse to say &quot;nu&quot;) i always felt not one band today can put a finger on my absolute favorite band of all time...Iron Maiden!  This CD not only cements that belief, but it was also done right smack in the middle of all these &quot;young superstar acts&quot; of today, being relased in 2000.  For anyone who can trash this album, look inside your cd book and put out ONE SINGLE CD THAT IS BETTER THEN THIS ONE!  TRY IT!!!!!  Ahem, to the songs:<br />The Wicker Man: 5/5 great starting song, although it did suffer &quot;mainstream syndrome&quot; a bit.<br />Ghost of Navigator: 5/5 VERY good work, classic Maiden.<br />Brave New World: 5/5 Ah, a Maiden CD with the title track being weak?  SAY IT AIN'T SO!  Sorry to dissapoint, but it's all good!<br />Blood Brothers: 4/5 At first i really didn't get it, but after subsequent listening i do enjoy it now.<br />The Mercenery: 5/5 I loved the kick in the teeth guitar intro!<br />Dream of Mirrors: 5/5 This song seems like a dream, one very good one.  PPL rag it b/c it's over 9 minutes, but the patient know the goodness of the song!<br />Fallen Angel: 4/5 Hard!<br />The Nomad: 6/5 Another 9+ minute song, but this one kicks MAJOR BOOTY!  The solos in the middle, the Air Raid singing, and Nicko's drumming, DARN!<br />Out of the Silent Planet: 5/5 See a pattern?<br />The Thin Line: 3/5 In my professional opinion this one sort of pales face to face with the rest of them.  From anyone else this song would be a hit but it lacks a punch, espically being the last song on the CD, which is rare for IM.<br />Overall: 9 of the 10 kick major arse and 1 some bits.  Very good CD for any IM fan or ORIGINAL METAL FAN!  Up the Irons!
6305181772|3.0|Director:  Brian De Palma<BR>Cast:  Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, Emilio Estevez, Vanessa Redgrave, Harry Czerny, Ving Rhames, Jean Reno.<BR>Running Time:  110 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.<br />Based on the popular 1960's television series, this Brian De Palma (&quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Scarface&quot;) production possesses all of the qualities of a fun, top-of-the-line action flick--only to see it slightly crumble due to a storyline that is extremely tough to follow.  Tom Cruise stars as the slick covert agent Ethan Hunt, who has been assigned with a crack team of American undercover agents to set up operations in Prague to catch a double agent (Jon Voight) in the act.<br />There are many scenes that are very exciting, especially the chase scene on the train finale; however, De Palma does not expand on a script that assumes the audience knows all of the technological and spy jargon, leaving us loving the action but lost in the wind.  Cruise is only fairly adequate as Hunt, not given the chance to expand his character.  Excellent special effects, a riveting, catchy musical score, and some fine supporting roles from Voight, Emmanuelle Beart, and Ving Rhames.  A good action movie, but nothing more.  Luckily director John Woo stepped in as director the second film, creating a rough-and tough, out of this world sequel that surpasses the original.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|im not gonna sit here and bash the new album, cuz after a few more thorough sessions with this album, its kind of grown on me. most slipknot fans will sit here and praise anything that comes from their favorite band. my opinion is going to be as unbiased as i can make it. the musical structure is still the same. still brutal, pulsating, terrorizing, and all that good stuff. the one thing that disappointed me, and most others is Corey's new vocal arrangement. we're all used to the brutal growls, screams and OCCASSIONAL melodic outbursts. it created the perfect balance. yet, ever since Corey was praised and recognized for hi &quot;voice&quot; in stone sour, it seems he brought in his new found pride. this album is almost undistinguisable. you could probably fool most people who arent TOO familiar with all their music. they'll say its slipknot when its actually stone sour, and visa versa. especially with the acoustic stuff. but then again as musicians and people, we grow. we show different sides, and change is always good.
B00002E233|2.0|Director:  Renny Harlin<BR>Cast:  Thomas Jane, Saffron Burrows, Samuel L. Jackson, LL Cool J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport.<BR>Running Time:  106 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence, shark attack gore, and language.<br />In 1975, a miraculous, terrifying film created by Steven Spielberg was released, causing such an uproar that people did not want to get into the water because they were so scared of sharks.  This film, of course, was &quot;Jaws&quot; and still to this day can make the heart jump a few beats.  &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;, the goofy horror flick directed by Renny Harlin, is no &quot;Jaws&quot;.<br />A midocean research station where scientists are researching the effects of artificial intelligence on sharks, the creatures develop superhuman smarts and turn on their captors.  Samuel L. Jackson's presences is wasted as the head scientist who is running the research, the special effects are only adequate, and the preposterous script takes away from several fine supporting performances (mainly LL Cool J, who lights up the screen with his strong stage charisma and charming humor).  An enjoyable movie if you are looking to sit down for nearly two hours and watch a cheesy action-horror picture, but largely disappointing if the audience is expecting a tense, atmospheric, and believable fright fare.
B000000W5N|5.0|Before I start, I just have to point out a huge mistake that most of you are making (including the Amazon review above).  MICK TAYLOR ISN'T PLAYING THE AWESOME LEAD GUITAR PART ON &quot;SISTER MORPHINE&quot;, RY COODER IS!  Don't believe me?  Check the booklet for &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;.<br />Now that that is out of the way, I'll start on the review of this album.  It rocks.  One of the greatest albums in rock history we have here.  However, in my opinion, &quot;Exiles On Main St.&quot; is the best Rolling Stones album ever.  &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; comes in second.  <br />So the songs like &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; get all the radio airplay, but they are only a fraction of the greatness of this album.  The songs &quot;Sway&quot;, &quot;Can't You Hear Me Knocking&quot;, &quot;Sister Morphine&quot;, and &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; are just as awesome as &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; or &quot;Wild Horses&quot;.  Not to take anything away from those two songs (they're awesome songs).<br />Besides &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;, the rest of the album feels rather dark, which isn't a bad thing at all.  The darkness adds an awesome feel to the album, although I don't think it was intended.  <br />Anyways, this album rules.  Good thing this album is on Virgin Records (as opposed to UMG), so it's still affordable.  Universal Music Group has released a ton of Rolling Stones albums on hybrid-SACD format, so they're expensive.  And to make it worse, it's the only format they seem to come in now.
1594200106|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than this if you are seeking living, breathing characters who you'll come to care about, high excitement and a complex and intriquing mystery. I loved this book and envy all who may be opening to those first pages right now, as they are in for a real treat. This wonderful novel really stays with you. Extremely well written and nothing appears to have been lost in the translation as even the occasional humor translates very well. I look forward to more from this author.  Also recommend The Flanders Panel/ Gospel /The Quincunx /The Eight /The Magic Circle

B0000CAXIC|5.0|&quot;Colour &amp; The Shape&quot; by the Foo Fighters is a powerful and evocative album that showcases not only Dave Grohl's songwriting abilities, but the tightness of the band. I won't go over each and every song, but there are three that I must comment on: &quot;My Hero&quot;, &quot;February Stars&quot; and &quot;Everlong&quot; are extremely haunting melodies in the midst of a lot of straight-ahead rock and roll. While Dave has denied that any particular song is dedicated to or about Kurt, one senses his presence. I don't know why &quot;Everlong&quot; was rendered into such a droll video... it's a terribly moving, sad song, lyrically and musically. In any event, &quot;Colour &amp; The Shape&quot; is a must-have for any true admirer of rock and/or musical craftsmanship.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|after the first album it steadily went down hill, Iowa wasn't that bad, but nothing can or ever will compare to the self titled album. It's sad that it's only been out 1 day amd already there are about 10-15 used albums for sale on here. That should tell the people something. As for me being a true maggot I am, but I'm not a fan of this garbage. Stick to what got you to the top.
B000002TP7|5.0|Just about ten years after the release of their first album, the Beastie Boys (not quite boys anymore) reveal that you can mature without losing your edge. ILL COMMUNICATION is so chocked with great songs that it might sound like a greatest hits anthology. It is also the eclecticism of the tunes that give off that feeling: there's punk, funk, old school stuff, retro 70s soul explosions, hints of reggae, jazz... and they make it sound so easy... none of it feels stiff or self-conscious.While later Beastie albums are also quite good, I think this is the one where they jumped the shark. But what a jump! Sure enough, the guys soon disbanded, but the good news is that they are releasing (or just have released) new music. What a welcome relief!
B00005Q66T|5.0|this cd is the best my favcorite song is a tie between &quot;Human Nature&quot; and &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot; the rest of them were ok except for about 2, whose names i will not mention.
B000089RVX|4.0|Before you make this purchase, check out the band Lacuna Coil. Evanescence's style of music is far from new - only new to popular radio. Lacuna Coil does it much better. In fact, I used to really like this Evanescence CD. After listening to Lacuna Coil, I can't stand the sound of Evanescence. <br />I gave it an honest rating - it is a good CD. However, there are a lot of good bands out there that don't get the recognition they deserve.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is the best show I've seen on the WB in forever! I can relate to some of the problems on the show, but in a more realistic way. Smallville is a VERY good show! Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, Kristin Kreuk, Allison Mack, John Schneider, Annette O'Toole and Sam Jones all do a great job on the show! I really hope this show has tons of great seasons! It's too good to stop on the 3rd season! I have both seasons 1 &amp; 2 on dvd at the moment, and any of you who haven't gotten them yet, you're missing out! The special features and commentaries are great!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is flat a big improvement after the disappointing noise album of Iowa. In my eyes, this album  totally blows the first album (which is an amazing album) out of the water. Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses shows Slipknot's versatility, talent and musicianshipit also shows that Stone Sour has had a major impact on Corey and James.  From the crushing riffs in &quot;Blisters Exist&quot; &quot;Three Nil&quot; &quot;Pulse of the maggots&quot; and &quot;Duality&quot; to the creep acoustic songs &quot;circle&quot; and &quot;vermilion pt. 2&quot; My favorite track on this album is between both versions of Vermilion and &quot;before i forget&quot; This album is a great album anyone looking for a good Cd to rock out to.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Lets face it people. 'Let Go' was pop, tinged with some faux-punk, and it made Avril look like the biggest poser/loser/hypocrite in the world. However, 'Under My Skin' is a pure, all-out rocker. The music, lyrics and voice have improved tenfold. 'Under My Skin' is about the realest, most intimate album out there right now, aimed at teens.<br />The album starts off with &quot;Take Me Away&quot;, which has one of the catchiest riffs on the whole CD. After that, we're on &quot;Together&quot;, which can get stuck in your head for what seems like an eternity. After that, we're on &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; probably the only song out there, right now, that teaches young girls to say no whenever guys only want a piece or whatever. &quot;He Wasn't&quot; reminds me a lot of 'Sk8er Boi' however, it's a pretty catchy song. &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; is an incredible track, the words, music and Avrils voice sound sooo real and so amazing. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; is the next release from &quot;Under My Skin&quot; and is one of the catchist songs on the CD. Next, we have &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; which has hard hitting words, about a girls longing to return to her youth. &quot;Forgotten&quot; is an alright song, not bad but not amazing either. &quot;Who Knows&quot; is really the only positive song the CD, catchy, nice message. After, we have &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot; which is such a pretty song, I really like it. &quot;Freak Out&quot; has one of the best music on the whole CD, however, I didn't really like the lyrics. And finally the last song &quot;Slipped Away&quot; is worthy of a tear. It's such a sad, passionate, emotional song. An amazing way to close the CD.<br />Avril's voice and writing skills have greatly improved on this new CD. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; finally shows us what Avril was being made out to be when she first arrived on the scene. A rock chick who stands apart from the rest of the crowd in terms of image, attitude, music and voice. With this CD release, Avril is finally getting closer to making her own unique sound and style instead of looking like a puppet that record execs made to fill the void for people who aren't into Britney.
0440213525|4.0|This book was set in a little town.  This was a very well written book about a teen who watches a man kill himself.  This is not such a big deal, until they find out that he is defending a man on trial for the murder of Senator Boyd Boyette.  The little boy and the murder are the only people now that know where the body is buried.  The boy is being threatned and questioned by many police officers.  The boy has grown up in a trailer park with his mother and his little brother.  He hires an attorney.  The attorney defends him and then she outsmarts the authorties.  They tried to question him without the consent of his mother.  The ending of the story is the best.  It was a very good book.
B000002MY3|5.0|One of the best Albums of the 90's. It has a richness of sound and lyrical focus that she has never come close to repeating.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|for the new and loyal slipknot fans this is an instant classic....slipknot takes their music abilitys to a whole new level vol.3 the subliminal verses takes a whole new look into the life of this 9 man mafia then take a big step up and take it to you hard then they bring it all the way down with their single &quot;Circles&quot; track 6 i would reccomend this cd to anyone who loves music that will kick your A$$
B0001CNPLI|5.0|I really think this movie is great!  It's my favorite martial arts / action film (aside from Bruce Lee movies).  And unfortunately it's not appropriate for children.  If one is into these kinds of movies and don't mind gushing blood they HAVE to watch it.  My dad collected martial art movies when I was a child (I'm 35 now) and I used to watch this movie over and over with my brothers.  When the reference was made to Shogun Assassin in Kill Bill 2 I nearly choked on my popcorn in the movie theater.  I heard only one other gasp from another patron from across the theatre, so I guess it's safe to say not many people have watched this film, and thought how unfortunate.  I was lucky to catch the series playing on the international channel about a year ago.  And since watching Kill Bill I've decided to purchase the DVD series.
0385336810|1.0|I read the entire Shopaholic series and loved it..this book didn't get off the ground until the final 10 pages. If you want a better read that's more for a mature adult, buy GREEN EGGS &amp; HAM by Dr. Seuss..don't waste your money on this book!

B000148KK2|5.0|I like many of the reviewers, own all of Diana's albums.  I consider her a good jazz singer, but not great.  This album by far, makes the most of her voice and piano talents.  I loved this album from the first play.  Black Crow was outstanding, Joni would be proud of this cover.  If you are new to Diana this album would be a great place to start.
0385507755|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. A triumphant story about a man's struggle to recovery, but it is not that simple. So many threads of truth and elation and every emotion you can think of are expressed and felt in this story. Read it.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Edward Bloom is a storyteller. He has tall tales to tell to everyone who'll listen, and to some who won't want to. According to him, he has lived a big life, with big things, big events, big characters (literally!). And it seems everyone enjoys this tales...except for his own son, Will (Crudup).<br />Will is mad at his father for never showing him the real person that he is, and as a result of this difference, they've spent more than three years without talking to each other. Until the day his father falls seriously ill and Will comes home in one last attempt to get to know his old man.<br />Just as much as a story of Edward Bloom's grand persona, this is a tale about a father and a son finally seeing eye to eye.<br />We get to meet Edward Bloom as a child, as a young man (played by McGregor) and as an old man (played by Finney) as he lives many of his adventures, from the time he met the town witch (Bonham-Carter), to the travels with Karl the giant and the meeting and wooing of this future wife Sandra (played as a young lady by Lohman and as an older woman by Lange). Throughout his life he meets amazing characters like Karl, the circus folk (including DeVito as the ringleader), the singing Chinese siamese twins, the hometown poet (Buscemi) and the people at the fabled town of Spectre.<br />While this film deals with magical and unusual characters and situationes, this is not your average Tim Burton piece of work. Gone are the dark, moody and sometimes eerie and scary settings, replaced by warmth and fun, and a happier story than in his previous movies.<br />The acting in the film is pretty good, especially Finney, McGregor and Crudup, but the best thing about this movie is its setting. Everything seems to be made out of some kind of magic, beautiful and shiny when things are going well, broken and dark when things go bad.<br />If there is one thing that I could complain about, is that the film seemed a bit long. The pace was too slow in some places, but as a whole, I think that was important for the storytelling.<br />In the end, Big fish is a lovely tale about a father and a son, and the many tall tales that separated them and then joyned them in the end..., I think that was important for the storytelling.<br />In the end, Big fish is a lovely tale about a father and a son, and the many tall tales that separated them and then joyned them in the end...
B000148KK2|1.0|I bit. I wasn't gonna, but I did. This lady is just flat out boring, and I never got the hook about this lady.

0061015725|4.0|First off this novel contains several elements similar to most Crichton novels. They are as follows: 1.) One or two main characters with several subsidiary characters 2.) Tragedy meeting a couple of the subsidiary characters which we don't feel strong attachment to 3.) Elements of science and technology even though you don't have to be an expert in the technology to grasp the story 4.) Disastrous consequences when humans either underestimate the technology being dealt with or catastrophic results from something just not going as originally planned.<BR>Having summed up those elements familiar to most of his novels this book is fairly decent. It deals with a father named Jack who is a Mr. Mom type recently out of work at a computer company. He has a wife who is now the worker in the family for a company named Xymos. This Xymos company is basically trying to create cameras using nanotechnology. In other words, amazingly small particles not discernible to the human eye which can be used to do all sorts of things from looking into the human body (as in the case of small cameras) to being little factory builders for other uses. This is supposed to be the new coming thing. Nanotechnology. Anyway, Jack's wife and some other factory workers somehow release some of these nanoparticle swarms they are working with into the desert. There are a bunch of other factors involved such as environment, sunlight, temperature and all that but these particles basically learn how to evolve. Through evolution they threaten to keep getting somewhat smarter collectively and to put the whole human race on the brink of collapse if not stopped. Jack, being the hero that he is, realizes what may happen and manages through certain circumstances to be in the right place at the right time (the fab plant at Xymos) and with the right amount of brains to stop this impending disaster. I won't give the story away and there are several twists and turns throughout the book. The thing I feel Crichton did the best was to make the novel suspenseful and mysterious. There was enough mystery to keep you reading ahead to see if you could figure out what was going to happen next...Which made for a fairly enjoyable reading experience.  This book isn't a masterpiece but if you are looking for a suspenseful mystery with elements of science and technology pick it up and give it a try.

B00007BHOE|5.0|THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST EVER LIVE CONCERT ON DVD I OWN! IF YOU ARE A DIRE SLIKNOT FAN THAN LOOK NO FURTHER THAN RIGHT HERE. THE SOUND AND VIDEO ARE PERFECT ON THIS DVD. THERE IS NOT MUCH BEHIND THE SCENES STUFF EVEN WITH A SECOND DVD BUT THIS STILL AN EXCELLENT PURCHASE. I WATCH THIS DVD AT LEAST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK AT FULL VOLUME!
B0001LJC2K|4.0|If there were a war between muse and all the crappy, whiney, pop-metal b-crap, there would be three musicians left.  Three victorious men overlooking a field of smoldering teenage almosts. This is MUSE.  Buy this album or your not cool.  Trust me, we can tell.  Mozart on speed, heading North on 1st Ave doing eighty.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album is not perfect sonically, as you've heard.  However, the  clanging drums, and absence of gritty bass guitar make it unique and pleasant.  You know a song from &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; when you hear it.  Contrary to others' opinions, I think that the guitars sound awesome.  As a guitarist, I find the guitar recordings on this album to be the best I have ever heard in the metal genre.  The guitar sounds warm, smooth, deep, with just enough edge.<br />As for the music, these other clowns will tell you how remarkable &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Dyer's Eve&quot; are (and they are!), so I am going to focus on the less popular, but just as good if not better songs.  The album starts with the coolest sounding introduction ever in &quot;Blackened&quot;.  An ensemble of reversed guitar melodies fades in to reach a powerful climax at which the really heavy stuff begins.  &quot;And Justice for All&quot; is Metallica's most underrated song.  The guitar riffs are phenomenal.  After a breathtaking solo, the band cuts to a high-energy drive that backs down to a beautifully heavy melody.  It becomes thicker as more guitar layers pile on.  Finally, a rich climax of no less than four guitar parts blasts at you.  I get chills and an amazing high every time I listen to this song.  All metal albums sound pretty much the same. Metallica was always different, and this one is the most unique and epic.  Even if you hate metal, but you like classical, this album will astonish you.  Pure genius.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|What can I say....speechless.  From the time I picked it up yesterday I have had it spinnin' nonstop.  Incredible-Masterful-Metallic-Mayhem!!!  Their first two albums, although incredibly hard and masterfully done, did not have input from each of the 9 members during the writing stage.  In a recent interview, it stated that for the first time each member of the band has their fingerprint on this album.  This means that the true diversity of the knot and the atmosphere of their live show (not the insanity, the atmosphere) truly comes through on this album.  SLIPKNOT HAS RAISED THE BAR.  Look, anyone can play angry, chord progressions with choppy drums and scream like a maniac......sad, but true.  If you listen to &quot;Get Inside&quot; on the Stone Sour album, you can see that the &quot;style&quot; of the other Slipknot albums is easily duplicated with only 2 of the original members from the Knot.  But to exercise true musicianship in a scene that lacks diversity is rare.  SLIPKNOT has not only met the challenge but exceeded it.  <br />The sound on this album is Phenomenal, Unique and truly expresses the heart of 9 guys from Iowa.  This is their best work yet: diversity, mayhem, acoustic, prolific writing, a vocal range that decimates any true metal album (with all respects to Burton C. Bell), driving rhythms....just awesome.  If you are a true fan of the Knot and appreciate musicianship then you should run out and buy this album immediately....on the other hand, if you are only a fan of the &quot;sound&quot; from their previous albums, you will more than likely be disappointed, because they make a clean break from the norm and redefine the scene.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Kill Bill: Volume 1 was brilliant and definitely one of the most exciting, pulse-pounding cinema treats of last year.  Heavily influenced by kung-fu flicks, Tarantino set expectations at an unusually high level for the second part, promising itself to be a Western pastiche.  Of course, Tarantino is hardly a conformist and what initially struck me when watching Volume 2 was that it seemed to take great glee in undermining all my expectations of the Western elements I was looking for.  Take the promised backstory to the massacre at the chapel - we get a tense work-up with Bill coming to visit The Bride and then we hear but never see the massacre that ensues.  Take Budd, a bloated has-been who sits in his trailer guzzling beer and wearing a cowboy hat, the very picture of a genre truly dead and buried, past its glory days.  It's clear from here that Tarantino's toying with his audience's expectations, becoming a true master of suspense (notably in the scenes with Bill) and showing us what 'Western' means today.  It's not cops and robbers and epic gunfights but trailer trash violence Jackass-style where old-school warriors are misfits in a dead landscape.<br />Still, Tarantino's not lost his love of retro-pastiche and these still provide his most entertaining sequences.  The fight with Daryl Hannah is hilariously brilliant, with the two heroines reduced to fighting with foodstuffs and toilet bowls.  This and the training sequences between The Bride and Pai Mei.  Using the zoom shot, the begrudging cruel master and cheesy fight scenes, Tarantino manages to give his love for the genre with a touch of humanity when we get to see how The Bride uses her teachings to break free of a coffin in which she has been buried alive.<br />The main criticisms levellled at Volume 2 seem to be that it is slower than Volume 1 and has a masochistic attitude towards women.  The first is admitedly true in sequences and this never reaches the freewheeling fun of Volume 1, though once it getsgoing, Volume 2 is just as much a force to be reckoned with and is certainly anything but stale.  The second is a hard one, especially seen as The Bride is put through just about every kind of punishment possible, be it torture, near-death or the loss of her daughter.  In particular, the resolution, where an assassin grants her life because she's pregnant might seem hokey.  But Tarantino pulls it off to make this self-proclaimed 'roaring rampage of revenge' exciting and fun enough to get past any sentimentality.  A lot of people sneered at her love for Bill, but surely this was levelled by the apparent respect she had for him and Tarantino's acknowledgement that love cannot be simply transformed into hate so simply.  Thurman gives it her all as well, proving that she's one of the best actresses of her generation in a role that will probably define her for years to become.  She's impressed in her roles in Pulp Fiction and Gattaca, but never before has her performance been so determined and committed.  Of course, she's helped by a superb supporting cast.  Carradine exudes a surprising degree of menace and Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen are both a hoot.<br />Okay, so Volume 2 isn't perfect, but along with its first part, it's the one of the most interesting, thrilling cinema treats in a fair while and even if the style isn't really your cup of tea, it's sheer exuberance (not to mention Tarantino's obvious talent and attention to detail) should be applauded.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|If I were you I'd just go watch the movie - the reviews here are so disparate that unless you have a highly-advances statistical analysis deegree you aren't going to be able to get much out of them.<br />The reviews seem to be broken down into two large chunks:<br />1.  People who loved the movie.<br />2.  People who didn't understand the movie.<br />Sadly, the second group feels like their inability to get what the movie about means the movie wasn't good.  Instead of saying &quot;I didn't like it&quot; or &quot;I didn't get it&quot; they say the film sucks, the actors suck, the music sucks... personally I suspect they are a somewhat bitter about paying to see a film that was over their heads.<br />Don't listen to them.  Don't listen to *me*.  Just go see the movie and make up your own mind.  Or hey, here's an even better idea: go see the movie and *don't* make up your mind about the film, just see it and go about your life and a week or two later sort of casually peek around the inside of your head and see how well the film fit in with everything else that is in there.<br />Not a good fit?  No shame there.  But if the fit between the movie and any specific head is poor, the blame might just as well lie with the head in question and not with the film.  Things just work out that way sometimes.<br />Take me, for instance:  I play guitar.  I admire people who play the guitar well, regardless of the type of music they play, with one exception: I can't stand American country music, not for a second.  Now I know that there are many talented country musicians, and I've seen bluegrass players who must have cut deals with the devil to play so well, but when it comes right down to it the music doesn't resonate with me.  Note that I didn't say &quot;the music sucks&quot;.  It doesn't suck - some of it is damned impressive... I just don't like it because it doesn't fit into my head.  Nevertheless I am certainly not going to go write bad reviews of every country song I hear, because that's not disseminating helpful information, it's just spreading ignorance, something you'd think some of these people would be less eager to advertise about themselves.<br />Go see the film.  Think for yourselves.ecause that's not disseminating helpful information, it's just spreading ignorance, something you'd think some of these people would be less eager to advertise about themselves.<br />Go see the film.

0441003257|5.0|This book is a losely based on the film Omen. You do not have to have seen the film to thoroughly enjoy this book. It describes a very British Armageddon. <BR>At the centre of the story are one good and one fallen angel. The fallen angel was never really convinced about Lucifer in the first case, and the good angel has a skeleton in his closet. The good angel is actually the funniest character in the whole book. For instance, he collects bible with misprints in them - I still chuckle five years after I read the book!<BR>Prattchet supplies the humour and Gaiman the atmosphere, so even the most funny sections have a threatening undercurrent, and the scary parts are subtly funny. I hope they do more collaborations.

0380789035|3.0|This is not Neil Gaiman's best. That does not mean it is bad - quite the contrary, it is pretty good. I just got the feeling when I read it that after the well-deserved success of Neverwhere he felt he had to write something similar for the US market. Neverwhere dealing with London, UK.<br />It was kind of obvious to me that he is not as familiar with the mystic and magic of the US as he is of London.<br />The American Gods of the book are surprisingly poorly developed, and he chooses Odin as one of the main protagonists, which gives a bit of a tired feeling to me. On the other hand, the description of the restless wife and the protected American small-town are truly chilling and up there with his best.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Hey!<br />So I work in an HMV in the blues/jazz/easy listening/country/folk section and I just have one thing to say about this cd.  WOW.  I mean, it is all over the store (meaning it's in the rock/pop section, on the chart wall, and in my section.  I hear it everytime I work and it is one of my favourite cds to listen to.  Usually, you tune out the music because you just don't care about it after working for a few hours.  Everytime a song from this album plays, my attention is grabbed and I sing along.  From the enthusiasm that the employees show for this music, we are moving it off our shelves and into the hands of happy customers.  I love this cd (in particular, I love the song \\"Come on in my kitchen\\") and I reccommend it to all.<br />C
1878574590|5.0|If I said that this is the most hard-boiled, unsentimental, brutal, and shocking graphic novels I've ever read I would not lie.<BR>The black and white illustrations give that extra hard edge to the already hard story.<BR>Marv is a psycho, he hears voices in his head, he needs constant medication, he is a a contract killer, and he is the hero of the story! The villains are even worse.<BR>What makes Marv different from the bad guys is that he follows a strict code of honour. When a woman in his company is murdered he gets out for revenge.

6305922756|5.0|The Special Edition release of This is Spinal Tap packs a lot of extras--really too many to describe in a review. We know we're in the right place when we hear the band commenting on the menu as the disk loads (predictably, it's hilarious). In addition to a pristine (almost too slick for what's supposed to be a spoof of a low-budget documentary), anamorphic transfer of the film with quite good sound, we're treated to:    Audio commentary by Spinal Tap (I haven't sampled this yet),    Six TV commercials,    Two TV \\"appearances\\" including a Flower People Press Conference and an interview with Joe Franklin,    Over an hour's worth of outtakes that are almost a film in themselves. While it's all unessential (helping us to appreciate just how well edited this film is), much of it is priceless. This footage is full-screen and looks appropriately cheesy,    Catching Up with Marty DiBergi--an interview with the embittered \\"director,\\"    Music videos, commercials, and \\"Promotional Materials\\" that include trailers, TV spots, and the like.    Everything is, of course, played excruciatingly straight. In addition, MGM really did it right (unlike, say, Universal, who lately always do it wrong); there are chapters for every feature so one can easily navigate, and there's no annoying self-promoting of other MGM titles. There's not one thing wrong with this release, including the price, and it's in a nice keep case rather than a crummy cardboard \\"snapper,\\" too. If you agree with me, drop MGM a line to let them know they're on the right track. Highest recommendation for a job well done.  BTW, are there REALLY viewers who think this is an actual documentary of a real band?!

People who didn't like slipknot for this reason, may become new fans after this, and people like me, who have an open mind too all genres, will like the old slipknot, and love the new slipknot, as well as have an increase in respect for thema s a band. <br />Prelude-Slipknot hasnt changed in that they always open with thier ambient noise intros, this one however does turn into an instrumental, with some random lyrics<br />The Blister Exists- This song has a presence that actually feels like a song that would be one Metallica's St. Anger instrumentally, yet it brings in Coreys own twist of vocals<br />Three Nil-This song is one of the heavier on the cds, ones the heavy slipknot fans may run to for remembrance of the old slipknot on this cd, with Coreys rare screaming on this cd, this one brings his old ways back, and has heavier guitars, that display less talent than the other songs on the cd<br />Duality-Perfect single to represent the new sound, its heavy but u can feel the new sound and its a perfect display of the other tracks<br />Opium of the People-The guitar in this song stands out most, unbelievable solo work, the solo sound is  a main riff in the song, very unique<br />Circle-WOW. Caught me off gaurd. I didn't even know slipknot knew what an acoustic was, but they knew how to use it DAMN well. Great song<br />Welcome- A heavier song on the cd, kind of follows the same lines as Three Nil, another song the old slipknot fans will enjoy. Good solo in the middle as well<br />Vermin-Great vocals from Corey on this track. It shows that his singing talent is actually just that talent. Proves on heavy songs he can still sing well<br />Pulse of the Maggots- This song is a great fan anthem, and shows that the band has not lost thier usual train of thought<br />Before I Forget-This is a great pump up song. Heavy but still not the old slipknot. Corey does a heavy rap feeling sorta thing, but it dosnt feel like rap singing at all. Its unique, and one of the best on the cd.<br />Vermillion 2- An acoustic (yes i said it more than 1 acoustic on this cd)version of the first vermillion and done very very well.<br />The nameless- Yet again another song old slipknot fans can lean on...for about half of it, the other half...guess what returns, slipknots new weapon.. the acoustic, and again Coreys vocal talents. A very unique and musically imppeccable mix of heavy slipknot, and slow acoustic new slipknot<br />The Virus of life- An okay song, but nothing really special. Its pretty heavy, but the vocals are too distorted, and there is an annoying guitar riff sometimes, but besides that its just a space saver, but not worth reaching to the skip button<br />Danger Keep Away-If you love all music, this song you want to do the exact opposite of, you dont wanna keep away from this, this song has a piano, harmony great lyrics among other things. It is unique and takes some getting used to but it is musically well done, and another great slow slipknot on this cd<br />All in all this is one of the best albums this year, and without a doubt slipknots best work yet, and a great sound change for a band on thier junior effort, and they did it without selling out. If anyone says they sold out tehy are ignorant, and if musically expanding, and broadening horizons is selling out, then by all means let them sell out, it alows us to hera better music. Slipknot...Rock On
B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|I so, so, so was hoping this would end up being the album all the fans called for, but was expecting the worst. I have been disappointed by Marillion time and time again over the past numerous albums. I enjoy the poppy side they found on THIS STRANGE ENGINE, but still wasn't satisfied with it as a pure Marillion album. But after that one, they lost me on RADIATION,  MARILLION.COM, ANORAK, and I feared this would be the same.<br />How wrong I was! I put it on fully expecting it to be terrible. What I found instead was possibly an album to place alongside MISPLACED CHILDHOOD as one of my favorite albums ever. The only thing holding back from a five star is that it is still too new to get that rating. <br />The songs move in a brilliant way and the whole band is firing on all the things that they have worked on over the past few albums. To me, it now seems obvious that all of the albums since BRAVE have been nothing more than demos leading up to this. This is a collection of all the things that have worked on those albums, and a perfect execution of them. <br />Thanks you Marillion for restoring my faith in you! <br />By the way, so you know where I am coming from: I started calling Marillion my favorite band when they released FUGAZI. It's been a LONG journey, and I am glad to say I have stuck around for it all!
B00005JLO2|5.0|Four Feathers was a nice surprise-we just kind of found it on the video rental shelf and had never heard anything about it. It is clean-no swearing, no sex (one scene it is intimated, but not really shown), and the violence is not gory/bloody in the extreme. The story line is very well done and a good example of heroism at work. I highly recommend it to both men and women-you won't be sorry you saw this one!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Under My Skin is another album by avril lavigne, and believe it's another stupid alternative garbage, she is not punk<BR>songs are terrible, the writing is horrible and the writing<BR>is once again ridiculous, I'll be glad this so-called sk8ter punk<BR>era is over just like rap rock/nu metal pop punk trash<BR>is<BR>Under my skin is an early canidate for the worst albums<BR>of the year.<BR>and this should be it<BR>Thumbs way down for me.<BR>This is just terrible
B00006IK1C|5.0|Well this happens to be one of the greatest CD's that you will ever buy. If you like DIO, Queensryche, or Iron Maiden you are asured that you will absolutly love this CD. His voice is astounding and I can't help but listen to this CD over and over. It has been around since 1990 and I have listend to it proboly about 1000-1200 times. It is a must buy.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This is definitely different from Slipknot's other two albums.  Slipknot shows that they can have melody and still play great music.  Rick Rubin did an amazing job at producing this album and could end up going down as a Slipknot classic.  This album is very close to my favorite work by Slipknot, but not quite.  Don't worry though, it's still flippin' amazing!  Anything by Slipknot has to be good.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Duality&quot;, &quot;OPIum Of The People&quot;, and &quot;Pulse Of The Maggots&quot;.  This is definitely for all the maggots out there.  This is something you don't want to miss out on!<br />Slipknot 4 Life
B0001UL7RY|4.0|This CD is amazing and shows that Avril as really grown up! She's only 19, and the lyrics and music are very real. I'm not an Avril fan, and when I first heard the lead single &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; I didn't think her sophomore album would succeed. But after I went to MTV.com and listened to the full album, my opinion totally changed. This is a new sound than her previous album and it's not as teenage as her previous CD. There's so many moving songs on here that will give you goosebumps, especially &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;...Go Avril and go buy this amazing album!
B00009N83U|1.0|Although I like GM cars, Pink Cadillac stands as being the worst movie of Clint Eastwood's career. He plays a modern-day bounty hunter by the name of Tommy Nowak that uses skill rather then a gun to catch his suspects, although he does carry a gun briefly here. Bernadette Peters plays this little curly-haired blonde who lives in a trailer with her dead-beat husband and his speed-freak friends. Her husband owns a pink cadillac and she drives off in it with her baby and a bag of money. Nowak is then sent to bring her back from a casino before her husband's gang finds her first. When they do, and kidnap the baby, Nowak and Peters bond when they give chase to get it back.<br /><br />The movie is red-neck and full of trailer trash stereotypes in every way. It also helps define the classic example of the woman that takes the bad boy, but then learns her lesson when she finds Nowak. But the movie has poor acting. Clint's chessy impressions, including an imitation of a drunken red-neck, do little to raise any laughs. The gang of army wannabe's don't make the film any more dramatic. The whole concept of \\"Don't mess with a man's automobile\\" is literally worn out.<br /><br />Despite the semi-colorful cast of Peters, Frances Fisher, and even Jim Carey, and an expansive soundtrack, this romantic comedy falls short of anything close to a classic. It's a good thing that Eastwood didn't direct this himself; Buddy Van Horn took the rap instead. This is the only film of Eastwood's career that did not receive a theatrical release in the UK, and it remains his lowest-grossing to date. Sorry folks, but Pink Cadillac never starts. If you are an Eastwood fan like me, get it to fill in the gaps of your DVD collection.
0790749556|5.0|this movie is extremely entertaining. Ginger's accent is hilarious. (Vill you dell madame Robairta, that I have an engargment with de Marquis de Indianans.) She steals every scene she's in, and her 'I'll be hard to handle' number is one of my favorites. she and Fred have that friends type relationship which is very amusing. Wisecracks fly everywhere, incuding Fred biting Ginger's hand in the beginning!! They of course do fall into each other's arms at the end, but would the public want it any other way?
B0001AP12G|2.0|Talk about too much hype.  The sample thing has been done before (did he go broke paying for all those beats??) so I wish people would stop acting like he's the 2nd Coming.  Also, I'm mad that the radio stations are playing his entire album.  No need to buy it, just grab a tape and record! <br />Oh and that whole, &quot;I hate college stuff&quot; is really annoying and it only back up Bill Cosby's rant.  Sure, Kanye is not responsible for kids educating themselves, but he could show a little responsibility.  He may not have liked it, it is definitely not for all, but why does he add such a negative connotation to it? Young kids are so impressionable these days.  &quot;College was not for me&quot; is a FAR cry from &quot; College sucks!&quot; <br />He's not that hot. And if I hear him featured on ONE more person's track, I will SCREAM!!!<br />Yo &quot;Music Biz&quot; stop shoving these people down our throats!!!  We're choking!!!
B000148KK2|4.0|As a huge fan of Ms. Krall and a huge fan of thick red wines and candlelight, this is the perfect album for me.  Let's face it, life can be stressful and sometimes you just want to kick back with a big fat glass of meritage &amp; turn the lights down low while a leather scented fog swirls around in your brain.  If that's what you're looking for, then buy this album.  I have plenty of Ms. Krall's (and other's) music that bring me around to other sides of my psychological mood swings.  I was thrilled to be able to just sit and mellow for an entire cd without lifting a finger for anything more important that pouring another glass.  This is as decadent as my &quot;sick days&quot; from work and that entire pint of double chocolate fudge I ate last week.  Cheers to you Ms. Krall!
B0001ENYKS|3.0|Poor Franz Ferdinand.  They look so delightfully lovely with that moustache - yet they are treading on ground I / many of us have come to despise.<br />If Franz are proving one thing, it's that the &quot;scene&quot; as we know it may have run out of chords.  I was beginning to have a tough time with this album until I discovered it is a concept album of sorts - let me explain.  The Franz have cleverly decided (with bigger label help) to put out a &quot;strike while the strokes are hot&quot; kinda album, reworking their own original material with edges of their influences.  Here we have a track-by-track that tells of each songs kindered spirit, complete with sample lyric -so don't you worry:<br />1. jacqueline - &quot;I don't mind if you kill me&quot; - Dead Kennedys, Pearl Jam.  Do they play Pearl Jam in Glasgow?<BR>2. tell her tonight - the line 'tell her tonight' kinda sums this one up - Hot Hot Heat<BR>3. take me out - &quot;we're just a cross-hair&quot; - the 'Quadrophenia' beginning only leaks a Strokes vox effect that will NOT go away.<BR>4. matinee - &quot;so I'm on BBC2 now&quot; - take your pick of any spy-flick from the mid/late 1960's.<BR>5. auf acshe  - &quot;she's not so special&quot; - the Cure<BR>6. cheating on you - cheating! - Supergrass (great choice) <BR>7. this fire - &quot;I'm out of control&quot; - Interpol  <BR>8. darts of pleasure - &quot;you are the latest contender&quot; - those Strokes are evil, and somehow influential as well. <BR>9. michael - &quot;so heavenly&quot; - one of two originals left to be.  great song as is.        <BR>10. come on home - &quot;I replace you easily&quot; - U2        <BR>11. 40 ft - &quot;la la la&quot; - the second original Franz bit. Again, great song - wish they all sounded this good.<br />Go boys - sell 3 million.  Next.
B000000OTY|5.0|Peter Gabriel's Secret World came at the right time for a lot of people who came to the age when spiritual and personal questioning begins. For me, I went through an ugly divorce and self-imposed isolation far from home in the far reaches of Northern British Columbia. I needed to reconsider my life and discover truths from within my past experiences. While going through my healing path I discovered this CD in the town's only music store. I liked Peter Gabriel and this new release was about his latest concert tour, the one I missed, so I bought it and gave it a listen to. <BR>From the beginning it is a cracking and dissolving of hard protective layers and outer shell revealing the joyous and celebratory musical expressions within. I have never been so touched and fullfilled by a simple CD recording. Throughout Secret World I found anguish and release, &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot;, &quot;Blood of Eden&quot;, &quot;San Jacinto&quot; and hope and celebration with &quot;Don't give up&quot; and &quot;In your eyes&quot;. <BR>Paula Cole's vocals are awsome, Tony Levin's bass strums go right through me, Shankar's violin create a mysterious and subconscious element and Peter Gabriel's lyrics and musical arrangements are genious. <BR>Buy this CD, it is a must for any lover of music and those in need of a healing.
B00020HEL6|5.0|I have just Renee tonight and she is one of the greatest<BR>finds of our times!
B000148KK2|3.0|Coming from an alternative/indie music background, I listened to this CD from a more objective perspective, yet I'm a little puzzled at some of the criticism's. Let's take this at face-value shall we, Diana Krall was never designed to aurally pump adrenaline into listeners. 'The Girl In The Other Room' is basically a jazz chill-out recording, romantic, seductive, and loungy. Diana Krall has this smokey, soulful, raspy voice, a nice compliment to the jazz-minimalist ensemble reminiscent of Miles Davis' 'Kind Of Blue' period. Smooth, bluesy, and intimate. Delicate touch on the piano, swirly rhythmic shuffle, retaining that subtle cool-jazz swing. Let's face it, vocalist jazz is introspective and mellow, and if listeners expected intensity and power, you might have to question why you're listening to Diana Krall in the first place. I admit, I'm not an afficionado, but I listened to 'The Girl In The Other Room' with open-ears and found more to like as opposed to dislike...because I knew what I was 'expecting' as opposed to having any expectations.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|To all you so called maggots out there who are dissing on Slipknot, you need to respect the band for taking the risk of trying something new.  Whether you like their new sound or not, you must give them credit for making the music they want to make and not caring whether you approve of it or not.  That said, I think the new album kicks @ss!  While it is different, I think it is brilliant and can definitely hold it's own against the other two albums.  Yes, they have some melodic parts and some \\"clean\\" vocals in there, but have you all forgotten the song \\"Wait And Bleed?\\"  That song had \\"clean vocals\\" and no one had a problem with it, so why is it that now that they have incorporated more of that melodic style into their sound you call them \\"sell outs\\" and accuse them of being Stone Sour?  This album is still a lot heavier than Stone Sour (minus the acoustic numbers).  Does an album have to be super heavy to be good?  No.  If Slipknot had created \\"Iowa Part 2\\" then you all would be criticizing them for not changing and having no creativity.  You can't please everyone and Slipknot obviously know this.  To all the true maggots who still stand by Slipknot and are open minded enough to enjoy the new album, stay (sic)!  The rest of you were never true maggots to begin with and Slipknot doesn't need you for fans!
0688163173|5.0|US Marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, set off on an assignment to Shutter Island, home of Ashcliffe Hospital for the criminally insane.  Their assignment while on the island, just off the coast of Boston, is to investigate the unexplainable disappearance of a female patient/prisoner Rachel Salondo.  As Teddy and Chuck try to unravel her mysterious escape, they only discover more questions without answers.  Teddy can't shake the feeling that unethical and terrifying experiments are going on at Ashecliffe and if he's not careful he may find himself a patient/prisoner himself.  However he can't force himself to abandon his mission and leave the island because he has a motive of his own....to find and kill his wife's murderer who he believes is housed at Ashecliffe.<br />Dennis Lehane has written an extraordinary novel full of suspense, terror, paranoia and a plot twist that will have you thinking for days after you've turned the last page.
B000268QB2|5.0|Unlike the trend going on now in the music industry: one good song and the rest are crab. \\"Hopes and Fears\\" isn't like a debut album. It's more like The Best of Keane. Every single song is great and can be a hit. Most importantly, Keane show some concerns about nature in their hit song: Somewhere Only We Know. Don't forget to pick up the &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; single because it comes with two other songs that are not in &quot;Hopes and Fears.&quot;
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Wow. There are few words to describe the brilliance of this album. Avril's Under My Skin really shows her maturity, both in her singing and in her songwriting. Her debut album, Let Go was excellent, but Under My Skin greatly surpasses it. Avril's songs are much deeper, more personal, and have so much more meaning behind the words. Many of them touched me deeply, including &quot;Slipped Away&quot;, a song devoted to her grandfather, and &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; which actually almost brought me to tears, as I can really relate her words in the song. <br />All of the songs on this album are truly wonderful; I like every single one of them. I am so happy that she hasn't fallen into the dreaded &quot;sophomore slump&quot;, as so many artists do. Instead, Avril has proven her undeniable talent on this record. Those who liked Let Go will love this album, and I believe that those who didn't should give Under My Skin a chance, and they will find that it is most definitely an album worth buying. <br />My new favorite CD!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This sophmore effort is much better than the first (Let Go). Im 34, Male, and really enjoy the music. The whole album is catchy, and has some great 'anthem' type songs that will be really popular.<BR>Seems to be deeper and better guitar work than the previous album as well.<BR>Enjoying it immensely, highly recommended for those who enjoyed her first album, or who enjoy good old fashioned rock.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is a very real story about the struggles teenagers have to deal with. Charlie is a wallflower or outcast who is really searching for some sort of truth throughout the entire book. Weather you are a teenager or an adult I think everyone can relate to some sort of aspect that is presented. All of his thoughts and emotions are written in a letterform so we as readers get to experience everything with him, mostly for the first time. Charlie never says who the letters are too or why he writes them, he just writes. <BR> Although this book takes place in the early 90's, I could relate to the majority and of the feelings, emotions, and events that take place. Entering high school as a freshman unsure and unaware of who you are is frightening and we hear all of Charlie's thoughts. In the beginning of the book Charlie's best and only friend commits suicide and that really tarnishes his ability to trust people. Later he meets a few upperclassmen that introduce him to drugs, sex, and music-, all of which change his life. <BR> Charlie is trying to figure out who he really is, with an athletic older brother who the family worships and a sister who \\"sneaks around\\" with her abusive boyfriend he already has a reputation for the world. However, he does not want to just be a younger brother of the star athletic or the pregnant sister, he wants to be Charlie. Though he isn't quite sure, who or what Charlie is, he starts to figure that out.<BR> Charlie falls in love with a girl who does not love him back but when she does finally start to love him, Charlie finds himself overwhelmed with emotion and cannot love her. He is in a constant struggle over what he really wants. Charlie finds himself caught up with drugs and becomes a frequent drug user during a part of the book, wandering the streets, always searching. When his sister finds out the truth about his drug habit and confronts him about her own secret (being pregnant) Charlie findsan emotional connection with a person he though he would never have. When Charlie walks in on the star quarterback for their high school kissing his male friend, he begins to question his own sexuality. Again, he is searching for truth. All of the incidents- happening to an ordinary freshmen teenage boy. <BR> I would suggest this first to teenagers. Drugs, alcohol, rape, sexuality, teen- pregnancy are all issues that teenagers today have to deal with. I would also suggest this to teenagers because his emotions are so true of what high school brings you- happiness, joy, success and also sad, depressed, let down, and confused. Charlie constantly battles these emotions. I would suggest this book to adults to read with an open mind and try to remember what the strong emotions felt during high school and some of those may even linger on to present day. <BR> I loved this book and could not put it down. I felt myself wanting to write back to Charlie because he is such a genuine guy who is just trying to get through high school. Some may criticize the fact that many of Charlie's likes in music and television are much older then his age (The Smiths, M*A*S*H) but I wouldn't criticize, instead look at the fact that he is a misfit so liking things that most people of his age don't like or know about would be so fit perfectly for him. Other people may say that the issues he goes through are not real and teenagers do not have to deal with that. I am a teenager myself and can honestly say I know at least one person who has had to directly deal with drugs, alcohol, rape, sexuality or teen-pregnancy. <BR> I rate The Perks of Being a Wallflower a 10/10 and highly recommend it everyone.
B00005U122|1.0|wow.  where to start off with what's wrong with this horrible disgrace of a \\"concert\\"... first off, there's no emotion whatsoever.  i watched in horror as roger waters, a wonderful lyricist and concept-writer of our generation COMPLETELY mangled some of the greatest songs ever produced.  i'll sit through a video of a band i think is even average, but i couldn't sit through this.  i guess roger thinks it's acceptable to try to \\"recreate the magic\\" by bringing in faux-floyd members and having them play the parts nearly note-for-note written by the original band members.  this is most evident and disgraceful in the case of the extremely talented young guitar player (the next jimi hendrix?  he could be, if he stopped playing for roger).  this video proves completely once and for all that david gilmour cannot be replaced.. the guitar player can play the notes, but the guitar tone and emotion that gilmour provides isn't even closely duplicated.  overall the band is very BORING.. a horrible thing for a rock band to be.  roger seems happy though.  good for him, he doesn't have to be in the audience.  the audience looked even more bored than me... i've literally never seen such a bored audience in a rock concert in my entire life.  they would clap more for a penguin with a little suit on.<br />the fact that so many people are impressed by this DVD is pretty laughable, and can probably be attributed to the facts that most people don't know much about music (they've never been in a band or written a good song) and the people that bought this were hardcore waters devotees.<br />ideally, waters and gilmour would be united in one great rock behemoth, but since they've parted ways, you must ask the question \\"who is the real pink floyd?\\" or \\"who is the closest to the 'real' pink floyd?\\"  the answer is unquestionably david gilmour, rick wright and nick mason.  if waters didn't want to join the party and rock the world, he could at least have the self-dignity to not mangle the floyd songs in the worst way possible.  he is obviously a very psychologically sick person now..  it's obvious he rules over the other \\"band\\" members, not giving them enough leeway in improvising parts for the floyd songs, which could breathe new life into them and make them listenable.<br />i love roger waters.. he's very talented and did some great works in his day.  unfortunately, he's washed up now.  gilmour chose to move on with life and make great music (watch \\"pulse\\".. enough said), while waters chose to carry a grudge, probably to his grave.. it's sad really.  and why?  because david gilmour was tired of his controlling ways?  because pink floyd used to be more than \\"roger waters solo\\"?  boo-hoo!  this DVD is a disgrace not only to floyd fans, but to all music.  maybe roger waters will get a heart again one of these days.yd songs in the worst way possible.  he is obviously a very psychologically sick person now..  it's obvious he rules over the other \\"band\\" members, not giving them enough leeway in improvising parts for the floyd songs, which could breathe new life into them and make them listenable.  <br />i love roger waters.. he's very talented and did some great works in his day.  unfortunately, he's washed up now.  gilmour chose to move on with life and make great music (watch \\"pulse\\".. enough said), while waters chose to carry a grudge, probably to his grave.. it's sad really.  and why?  because david gilmour was tired of his controlling ways?  because pink floyd used to be more than \\"roger waters solo\\"?  boo-hoo!  this DVD is a disgrace not only to floyd fans, but to all music.  maybe roger waters will get a heart again one of these days.
1401300901|1.0|I admit I'm not a fan of Bridget Jones. But I love Mariann Keyes and Carole Matthews if that helps! I was curious about the hype for PS I Love You. Probably shouldn't have read it after 'Crow Lake' and 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven', though. Ms Ahern's writing is very ' clunky': even amateurish in places.  I know she's 22. And publishing a debut novel at that age is a huge achievement. But then Zadie Smith was 21 when she wrote White Teeth ..... (I think!)<br />I loved the idea of the list. Thought that was so original. But something never clicked for me as to why list making was so important to their relationship. Was Holly disorganized? She didn't seem so ...  <br /> Sharon and Denise were great! As was the funky baby sister with her pink hair.  The secondary characters were the reason I finished the book. Holly, the heroine,  never seemed three dimensional to me. <br />Honestly? I couldn't recommend it. Sorry!
B00005JMEW|5.0|Uma Thurman will stare right at you.  She'll continue to stare while you read the credits.  While you listen to the funky vintage music.  While you remember what it was like to feel like a superhero.<br />Then she'll wink, and you will suddenly realize she is there.<br />This movie is incredible down to the very last milli of a milli-second.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This album is much different from MM's later stuff, as has been mentioned.  It's very original, and it can't be classified in any genre.  I absolutely love every track on it, and it's got a very creepy atmosphere that's at the same time almost happy.  Favorites are 'Wrapped in Plastic', 'Organ Grinder' and 'Lunchbox'.  An absolute must-have, for anyone.  Even easily offendable people need to hear this, as it might open their eyes.  The lyrics are so true.  I was a christian when I started listening to MM... that time has ended.
B00002E285|4.0|I love &quot;The Wall,&quot; both movie and album.  The story is very close me, so maybe I'm a bit biased.  <br />I've heard people say you'd have to be stoned in order to watch it.  I disagree, I understood it perfectly. &quot;Tommy&quot; on the other hand...now there was a movie you'd probably have to be stoned in order to enjoy! <br />I give it 4 stars only because the album version of &quot;Mother&quot; was better.  Plus, the movie doens't have &quot;Hey You.&quot;  (It was filmed, but was cut out of the movie.  See it on the DVD and know why).
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Ok, from first impressions this album is AWESOME.  The heavy songs are as good as ever, and as other people said they mixed in a lot of mellower material.  The lyrics are better as a whole.  Corey uses his awesome singing voice.  People who put so much stock in heaviness shouldn't be aloud to write reviews.  The first 2 albums were long enough and had enough heaviness to last forever.  We don't NEED another heavy album, although that wouldn't be a bad thing.  I love this as much as all their albums but for different reasons.  I also don't think it's a possibility that they have 'sold out' as they already have tons of money, they wouldn't make another album just for that.  I love all the tracks.  Songs like 'Three Nil' hint that Corey is tired of being a rock star and having his discontent commercialized.  'Vermillion' is the story from 'Prosthetics' all over again.  'The Blister Exists' and 'Opium for the People' are my favorite heavy tracks.  I really do hope they make another album.  This shows some new maturity.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album is far superior to any album this year.   Musically and Vocally this album stands out above all albums.  No Parental Advisory, I don't give a damn, you may like Slipknot because they swear, then you are not a true Maggot [what slipknot calls their fans]  If you were to compare this album to any other Slipknot album, you may be dissapointed just because there are acoustic songs and no swearing. I dont Really like the acoustic songs, so i skip them.    Corey Taylor and the rest of the group have matured in a great deal. This album sounds alot like a mix between Slipknot and [corey taylor's] Stone Sour.    here we go    1.Prelude 3.0- just a intro but its pretty cool. [*/10]  2.The Blister Exists- very good song but you could get bored of it.[7.5/10]  3. Three Nil- amazing song. Very strong and melodic. [9.5/10]  4.Duality- This song is just so amazing its addicting. from the first 15 seconds i was hooked. [10/10]  5. Opium Of The People- good song. its easy to get bored of it it u listen to it too much[8/10]  6.Circle- an acoustic song. very melodic. If you like Stone Sour's BOTHER, then you may like this. [6/10]  7. Welcome- my 3rd fav on this album. Pretty amazing. great guitar and drums. [9/10]  8. Vermilion- creepy song...i didnt like it. i still dont know hy they made it a single [6/10]  9. Pulse Of The Maggots- BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM. this song is so heavy it will blow you away. The \\"Army Invasion\\" kind of theme is awesome/ the intro is cool too. [10/10]  10. Before I Forget- wicked song. another single [9/10]  11. Vermilion Part 2- least favourite song on the album [4.5/10]  12. The Nameless-good song..could have done without the soft parts though [8/10]  13. The Virus Of Life- pretty eery too. its great. [8/10]  14. Danger--Keep away- its kinda weird i dont listen to it often. more of an outro. bad way to end an album. Should have ended it with a poem like Stone Sour did. that was original. [5/10]    to sum it all up, BUY THIS ALBUM. its great.worthevery penny. Get the LIMITED EDITION.    Stand out tracks    Duality  Pulse Of The Maggots  The Nameless  Before I Forget  Welcome  ~  a little background trivia for you all. Slipknot recorded this album in HOUDINI Manson. where Harry Houdini [majician] lived.  They say its haunted. Slipknot says they saw ghosts. pretty weird.   Bottom line though, dont buy this album expecting their first release.
B000002LR6|3.0|I'm sorry but I have to dissagree with all hype surrounding this album. It's definately a let down from their previous two. Don't get me wrong, half of the songs on here are very good, but there are some songs on here that just sound like repetttttative noise. TVII makes me reach for the fast forward button faster than a starving Nigerian reaches for a sandwich. Not to mention the ridiculous \\"Jesus built my hotrod\\", which definately does not show the sinister edge that most of their songs,(especially the earlier ones)did so well. This album proves that the worst thing that can happen to a band is become mainstream. I do like the first track, N.W.O. and \\"Just One Fix\\",which is repetative, but in a good way. \\"Scarecrow\\", probably being my favorite. But, as far as the rest of the songs, I could probably do without. The classic \\"Land of Rape and Honey\\" is still their best, even after all these years.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|After the brutality of IOWA, this cd is a disappointment.  There are some nice musical tangents that they pull off, but if I wanted a cd that my mom would be comfortable listening to, I would have bought Clay Aiken's.  A message for Corey and crew:  This is Slipknot, not Stonesour.  I'd like to see how Stonesour fans would react if there were four songs on their new cd filled with blast beats and death metal vocals.   Slipknot should have stuck with what got them to this place and not have lightened up to appease other fans.   I guess I'll have to wait for Meshuggah's new cd to be impressed.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|I just listened to clips of the songs on circuitcity.com. Avril has made a great stride forward in music. some of the songs sound similar, and there are 2 slow songs. my favorite is together. like the last cd, avril speaks her mind, with loud break-up songs, and much more. you won't be dissapointed by this cd! i'm going to buy it this weekend.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i really love this cd! Avril ahs matured a lot with her writing! I love Don't Tell Me, Nobody's Home, Slipped Away, Forgotten, and My Happy Ending! These songs she has done has proven she has really matured more in her writing!!! I reccommend this album to anyone!!! This is the best album out there!!!! GREAT ALBUM!!!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Where to begin?  I honestly can't believe some of the poor reviews this album has been recieving.  Granted its not the same sound that slipknot has become known for.  When I first heard the cd, I found this kind of depressing.  However, as I listened to the cd again, I realized how increadible each song was, and have accepted the change as a positive one.  <br />I know everyone would have loved to have the same old brutal Slipknot, I know I would have.  However, this cd is by no means &quot;soft.&quot;  (Though it is hard to imagine them singing Circle live... That should be interestign) Listen to Vermillion and realize how sick it really is... Just like Prothetics.  Listen to the Blister Exists and love it for its creativity and its shear insanity.<br />The fact of the matter is, we've already got three great slipknot cd's where they scream their brains out and express only hate.  I think its awesome that the third cd still rocks and covers so much more ground musically.<br />I've been listening to this cd non stop for about 3 days (I cheated and downloaded it early... Still bought it at a midnight sale first thing on tuesday), and I've really, really come to love it.  Can't stop listening to Vermillion, The Blister Exists, Before I Forget, Nameless.... Well, the whole cd.<br />Please give the cd a chance, you'll find it makes a great addition to your Slipknot playlist.  You'll find there is a reason that most professional crytics give it rave reviews.  &quot;I am the damaged one, all my life and the damage done.&quot;
B000089CJI|2.0|Wow, what a letdown. After reading the impressive accolades being heaped upon this album here prior to buying it, I was really expecting so much more. It's pretty sad that this is what passes for &quot;pop-electronica genius&quot; these days. Other than a few rare exceptions, mostly this album sounds like rehashed bubble-gum-style 80's-electronica ear candy, without an original angle or any impressive instrumentation. <br />This album doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as last year's &quot;Neon Golden&quot; by the Notwist. Now THAT's electro-pop brilliance. This, I'm not sure what to make of, other than I'm about ready to &quot;Give Up&quot; on Ben Gibbard at this point. Between this album and the equally disappointing &quot;Transatlanticism&quot; by Death Cab for Cutie, it's becoming apparent to me that the guy is spreading himself too thin in trying to put out quality efforts with 2 bands. <br />He's plenty talented, no question. One listen to DCFC's &quot;The Photo Album&quot;, a phenomenal piece of work, proves that. It just seems to me that as he's expanding in different and numerous directions, the quality of material is suffering, even with greater production. Just personal opinion.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I have listened and grown to love the eclectic compilations known as Quentin Tarentino's movie soundtracks. I am total amorous of the discs for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and when I heard the \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\" soundtrack, I once again in love.<br />Soundtracks can make a movie that much better, and no one knows how to pick the selected pieces like QT.  From the opening song, \\"Bang Bang\\", sung by Nancy Sinatra, who is more famous for \\"These boots were made for walking\\" than this unknown recording, to \\"Don't let me be misunderstood\\" which is somewhat a lost disco classic. To \\"Twisted Nerve\\", which is whistling made cool.<br />Quite a difference in music genres there, and that isn't where it ends.  Highly entertaining and a feast for a true music fans ears, \\"Kill Bill Vol. 1\\" is a soundtrack worthy of a purchase.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I haven't been this disappointed since Metallica's LOAD in '96.  Most of he songs lack cohesion--they sound as if all 9 of them wrote 20-30 seconds of material per song and then drew the parts out of a hat and played them in that order.  The ones that do have some sort of unity, like Duality (ironic, huh?) and Pulse of the Maggots, are not up to slipknot's previous level.  Experimenting is fine, but remember that oftentimes the standard is standard for a reason.
B00008G9JM|1.0|Ask any Jethro Tull fan about Passion Play and you will probably get a passionate response. It seems you either love or hate this album. First of all, if you are only familiar with Tull because of &quot;Aqualung&quot; or one of their more commercial albums, avoid Passion Play. This disk should be labled &quot;For Serious Tull Fans Only&quot;. I am a huge fan of Ian Anderson and have enjoyed all of the bands other albums, but for the life of me I just cannot get into the 45 minute-plus song that is &quot;Passion Play&quot;. Maybe I just don't get it, or I am not deep enough to appreciate what Tull was trying to do here, who knows? All I know is that musically this album pales in comparison to the 5 star classic &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;, and that even as a die hard fan, I cannot understand why they would want to record &quot;The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles&quot;. With my first listen to &quot;Passion Play&quot; I was grateful for the diversion provided by the nursery rhyme like story of &quot;Hare&quot;, but after listening twice &quot;Hare&quot; gets old really quick. &quot;Passion Play&quot; seems very lethargic musically, and even Anderson's usually enjoyable flute work seems melancholy and muted. I found that unlike &quot;Brick&quot;, &quot;Passion Play&quot; seems very repetitive and vocally almost monotone. Buy &quot;Passion Play&quot;, if you want to own the entire Tull catalog, but don't plan on it staying in your CD player longer than the initial 45 minutes it takes to listen the one time. Or like another reveiwer suggested, &quot;Passion Play&quot; is good to pull out and listen to once every 3-4 years.
B000002UDB|1.0|The cover depicts people disguised as animals.  The album contains lite pop disguised as rock music.  Neither disguise works very well.
B000005JEM|5.0|By now I am sure most Tull fans know Warchild was the soundtrack to a movie Ian Anderson planned to do in the 70's. It's a shame the movie was never done, but at least we have the soundtrack to enjoy. From the opening of &quot;Warchild&quot; through &quot;Two Fingers&quot; Jethro Tull once again offer the listener a variety of songs only Tull could perform. &quot;Sealion&quot; as other reviewers have pointed out is a masterpiece of time changes and fantastic lyrics. &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot; is simply a great rock song, and from what I understand Tull's biggest single here in the US. Following on the heels of the critically reviled &quot;Passion Play&quot;, &quot;Warchild&quot; returns to what Tull does best, great rock n' roll. Every song is enjoyable and stands the test of time. Almost 30 years later the songs are still fresh, and you get to glimpse a time when true musicians ruled the radio dial. I see that &quot;Warchild&quot; is currently out of stock, which means a &quot;remastered&quot; version is on the way...(sigh). I am sure they will add some bonus tracks, or an interview, but if you can pick up a used copy of the original album, I see they are listed here for under $5, do so. You can't go wrong at that price, and hear the album that way it was originally presented, and envisioned by the band in the mid-70's. This is a Tull classic, and should not be missed!
0780631684|1.0|This movie was just disgusting, not scary. The plot was weak and predictable, and most of the cast was unintelligent. The acting wasn't too bad, but it certainly wasn't top-notch. I hate how most of these teen slasher movies are all basically the same argo most if not all cast members die at a certain point and the main character is sitting down and drinking champange at the end and of course he doesn't die because then there wouldn't be a movie. Well, if you enjoy watching people die/and or you like the sight of blood and lots of it, then this movie is for you.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Like my review says...this CD is just flat out phenomenal.  <br />First off, for all of you who say that this band has gone &quot;sour&quot; as you would like to say, you're totally wrong. If you think that these guys are sounding like Stone Sour then all you're listening to is Corey's vocals, you're not listening to the lyrics.  It's gonna sound somewhat like Stone Sour because, well, I don't think Corey can change his voice for different bands.  <br />Now, in this CD Slipknot shows the multiple reasons of WHY I love this band.  First off, this CD sounds absolutely nothing like their previous releases (Slipknot and Iowa).  Their sound has changed and evolved from CD to CD.  Their debut shows their start, a mix of thrash and heaviness.  Iowa shows their true dark side with the constant screaming of death metal from Corey and Vol. 3 shows their more melodic side.  And, not only does it show their melodic side, but they're also able to mix in with the hard, raw, heavy screams, guitars and drums that you're accustomed to with Slipknot.  <br />Vol. 3 shows the true talent of every band member in it.  James and Mick get to show off their guitars more with the solos.  Joey's drums sound better than ever.  But the most noticeable is Corey.  He goes from the hard, raw vocals like in Welcome, to the raw, manical scream in The Nameless to the softer, ballad like vocals that are found in Circle and Vermilion Pt. 2.<br />Then there are the lyrics in this CD.  They are just flat out amazing.  And Corey does an awesome job mixing heaviness with melody in a sound that is so different than what oyu are accustomed to.  The lyrics are so much more thought provoking and have so much more meaning than those of Slipknot and Iowa.  And the oddest thing of all...they oull all this off WITHOUT swearing.  And for all of those who heard Iowa...you, like me, were definitely not expecting that.<br />All in all this is by far the best CD of the year and easily the best CD Slipknot has EVER done.  Slipknot blew me away with their first one, amazined me at the changes they did with Iowa, and still, never ceases to amaze me on how they change, but still, in many way, remain the Slipknot of old.  Progressing, unlike what some people may think, is a wonderful thing.
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I rented this Dvd when it first came out in January and I wasn't that impressed, though I liked the old school FX and of course the yummy Kate Beckinsale. I heard about the extended cut, and since I had some extra money laying around I bought this newer version along with LOR: Return of the King today. I liked this version way better because it fills in the many plot holes and helps flesh out some pretty thin characters. If you want to buy this movie be sure to get this feature loaded Extended Version.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I first heard this entire CD on mtv.com. I was surprised. For not previously owning an Avril CD, I loved it.  Most of the songs are catchy which is great depending on what your looking for.  Defenitly worth buying.  I went out today to do just that, after hearing the CD several times, initially for one song &quot;How does it feel&quot;.  Miss Lavigne depics herself a punk rocker badass, but if you listen to the lyrics on some of the songs on this albulm she is not afraid of being real and a down right girl, feelings and all.  Call it rock, or pop, or pop/rock, its awesome. Her sound on this albulm? think Alanis.
B00008EYA5|2.0|Mr. Jackson is a true Great actor. However, he needs to be more selective in his roles. unless it is about the money.<br />I mean I am a big fan of his. But what impact did he have in this movie. Plus,The plot was weak. And the Villan was really boring. And You love to hate. I don't mean that in a Good way. No you actually hate his role and wish they could replace the actor along with his boring dialouge.<br />Movie should have been a TV movie.
B000002H33|5.0|This was by far the best Metallica C.D.  From the smashing sounds of &quot;Battery&quot; to the great instrumentation of &quot;Orion&quot; this is Metallica at their best.  If you are a Metallica fan this is the C.D. to buy.  I also suggest the Black album, and the ...And Justice For All album.  The best band of all time.  Buy this C.D.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Before I start, The movie is violent, and bloody, and Foul Language.<br />With that said, I can only hope Vol. 2 lives up to the expecations.<br />Anyway, VOL. 1 is an A+ Movie. PAcked with action, keeps you glued to the TV. I must also say that every character fills his/her role in an effiective way.<br />Tarantino humor that always amuzes me. And for the Tarantino fans you will enjoy this movie because his prints and creative direction is all over the movie.<br />Folks Please do not compare Kill Bill Vol. 1 with Pulp Fiction. Yes, Bot movies are the product of Quentin. However, It is a totally different genre. Pulp focus more on dialouge, Bill focuses more on martial arts action etc. So even the way the pace of the movie is going different.<br />Enjoy<br />Nawaf
B0001UL7RY|1.0|apparantly with the fading of the pop punk scene Avril had to slant her image and music towards the nu metal scene to stay popular. Her newfound angst (*insert laugh*) can be found throughout this extremely mediocre record. Although some songs are quite catchy, they quickly lose their kick and become boring rehashed songs with lacking melodies.
B00004XONN|1.0|Before Radiohead set out to make Kid A, I imagine they had a conversation that sounded something like this:<br />Radiohead Member #1:  Well, we just made OK Computer, one of the most creative and highly praised albums of the 90's.  What do we do next?<br />Radiohead Member #2:  Beats me, I'm tapped out.<br />Radiohead Member #3:  Me too.<br />Radiohead Member #1:  OK, let's make an album full of weird sounds and moaning.  People won't know what to make of it, so they'll say that it's brilliant.<br />Radiohead Member #2:  Works for me.<br />Radiohead Member #3:  Excellent.<br />Alright, they probably didn't have that conversation, but if they did, the result would have been this album.  It's tough to find anything to praise about Kid A.  How much you'll like it depends on how well you tolerate pretentious art.  Do you find meaning and pleasure in a painting consisting of paint balls splatted on canvas?  If so, here's the album for you. It's all about atmosphere, apparently. The moody tones, beeps, moans and random horns creating a sense of being stuck in traffic, and all the drivers are wishing they would die.  Yippee!<br />Musically, there's not much here.  One thing I can say for it: Radiohead had to have guts to release it at all, knowing that most people would say it was crap.  I can respect it on that level.  I just won't play it.
0393324818|5.0|It goes without saying - for baseball fans, numbers people, entrepeneurs, etc., this book is a must read.  But unbeknownst to most, this book is a MUST READ for one demographic in particular:  fantasy baseball enthusiasts.  <br />If you are a fantasy baseball owner, please buy this book, because essentially, Billy Beane is running a real-life MLB team no differently than you are running your fantasy squad.

B00004RF9I|5.0|On the 25th anniversary year of NETWORK a couple years ago, there were several news article looking back at the film and how its impact on movies/media seemed almost &quot;prophetic&quot;: the degrading mess of news turning into entertainment, the fourth network, etc.<br />NETWORK is still a powerful film and its many messages are still relevant today--perhaps more so.<br />I've always been a big Paddy Chayefsky fan and I consider NETWORK to be his masterpiece.  He's still the only screenwriter to win three Oscars (the other two were MARTY and THE HOSPITAL).  You feel that the folks behind this movie really knew what they were talking about.<br />The cast is brilliant: Peter Finch deserved his posthumous Oscar and Faye Dunaway was a cross between Mary Richards from &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; and Satan.  William Holden, who originally wanted Finch's demented newsman role, brings all his world-weary cynicism that started in SUNSET BOULEVARD with him.  And Robert Duvall has a few hilarious moments as, at first, the cool button-down &quot;hatchet man&quot; and then turning into a raving ratings monster when the Nielsens come in.  Outstanding.<br />I would hope that someday we'll get the Special Edition DVD release that NETWORK deserves.  Interviews, commentaries, whatever they've got.<br />We're waiting!
B00005ABI8|5.0|Ok, we all know that Cake did not win any intellectual awards for their music...that does not mean that it will lower your IQ if you listen to it!!  I love Cake because they are incredibly talented musically.  Their lyrics are fun to listen to and make me laugh, but more importantly their MUSIC is superb and is not repetitive at all, unlike most bands nowdays!  This is my favorite of their cds, I like every single song.  Not only are the songs different from each other, but within each song are many different musical elements that makes this cd great to listen to!  I definitely recommend this album.  (I personally like the edited version...just my preference! :))
B00003CXDZ|5.0|When you talk to people who have seen Moulin Rouge, they either love it or they hate.  But no matter if you understand this film or not, you cant deny how much work and effort went into making this.  The movie grossed about $60 million at the box office and won 4 Oscars.  <br />Its truly a feast for the eyes, each minute saturated with color and music.  So yeah, Nicole Kidman isnt the best singer in the world, but she sings with feeling, like an actress should.  Kidman, who was nominated for and Oscar for this role and won the Golden Globe for it, is absolutly stunning.  I still say she should have won the Academy Award.
6305781427|5.0|Since the first time I saw Yanni's beautiful black hair I knew this DVD would provide me with the opportunity to watch it flow as he did his thing on stage.  Simple put, this DVD has changed my life and the lives of others around me.  Whatever you do in life, what ever difficult decisions you encounter Yanni and his band will always be there with you.  He loves the world, he loves his band, and he most certainly loves his hair.(as we all do)
B0001BKAEY|2.0|By the time this superannuated, bloated overproduction finally groans to the finish line, one is left wondering what everyone was so excited about it the first place.  When you can't find a plot, resort to the next best thing --- lots of explosions, special effects, and violence.  I remember when devotees to this &quot;epic&quot; anticipated &quot;Reloaded&quot; like it was the 2nd Coming.  Once &quot;Revolutions&quot; finally was released, the prevailing attitude was, &quot;well we wasted our time with the first two --- we might as well see the damned thing to the end.&quot;  It almost seemed as though the viewers were reluctantly performing a chore, like cleaning out the refrigerator of all of the old scary experiments nestled on the back shelf.<br />Now the marketers try and tell us this is the &quot;greatest cinematic trilogy of all time.&quot;  Uh-huh.  Sorry folks, that honor would go to &quot;The Godfather,&quot; even with the relatively weak 3rd installment of that series.  I can only hope that the Geekowski brothers keep their word and do not release a 4th Matrix movie, because this was more than enough.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Avril Lavigne is Canada's answer to New Coke.  Can your product whichever way you please, it's still going to fizzle with sugary sweetness and have half the calories of real Coke.  In Lavigne's sophomore effort, UNDER MY SKIN, the self-mis-pronounced \\"sk8er girl\\" demonstrates that she's no longer a mixed up seventeen year old Canuck.  In effort two, Avril becomes a new breed of screech, namely she opts to wear the goth-like tennis player sweat catcher on her LEFT wrist.  Other changes for the new album include Lavigne donned in low-lights instead of high-lights and hair that is a few inches longer.  Aside from those changes, you get more of her first CD with less compelling hooks and repetitive lyrics.  The first line from the first song on her collection says it all, \\"I cannot find a way to describe it.\\"  Twelve songs into UNDER MY SKIN, she still cannot find a way to describe it.<br />The only true saving grace on the CD is the first radio hit, \\"Don't Tell Me.\\"  In the track, Avril waxes pessimistic (big surprise there) about a guy who is trying to tap her nineteen year old \\"sk8er\\" purity.  The second \\"to-be\\" hit, \\"My Happy Ending,\\" will inspire radio listeners across the country to IPOD their way out of AM/FM teeny bopper purgatory.  Unlike her first album, there are no fleshy narrative (en)trails to keep the CD in your player.  If you can, however, turn your brain to the \\"off\\" position, Lavigne's voice is pleasant enough to listen to.      <br />While her music is not a total bust, her television appearances are weighed down by six tons of suck.  Yesterday, I watched Avril give Jessica Simpson's gimp-brain a run for its money on a mind-numbing episode of T.R.L.  Apparently, \\"like\\" is the songstress' favored word filler.  When asked what she thinks about media outlets painting her as a rebel punk, she responded, \\"Like, the media (grabs her left breast and flips her hair to the side), they like (exhales a cloud of invisible angst), totally just, like, do things and (desperately searches for the word to NAIL it) stuff.  They, like, don't know (clearly lost in her own verbal vomit), like, me.\\"  After she said \\"like\\" sixty more times and scrunched up her nose, she, in true Courtney Love at nineteen fashion, flipped off the camera.  Sorry, I don't buy the tough girl \\"I'll flip you the bird\\" image from a steaming bag of \\"like\\" and cherry lip gloss.  Hell, if I have to watch this one walk down another city street shoving random pot-heads in another video, I am going to become the president of the Clay Aikan fan club.  If you are looking for substance or self-reflection, you'd be better off buying the first season of Dr. Phil on DVD.  Yes, ladies and gents, the newly ordained Queen-o-\\"Like\\" penned every track on the album.  Thankfully, she had some help.        <br />Overall, Avril, I recommend taking the red pill and going back into THE MATRIX (her first CDs producers).  Sure, it may not be as seductively packaged when you go down the rabbit hole but at least it's (not the) REAL (world you spit in our ears).  If you can't utter a single intelligible line in an interview, don't think you're ready to take more creative control of your musical endeavors.  While I'm clearly not a fan of this CD, I do think there's hope.  I hear that she's planning to part her hair to the RIGHT on her third endeavor.  Will the Gods of re-creation never cease to fail us?
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I picked up the new album a few hours ago.  I heard there were to be some mellower songs.  But I would never have expected acoustic guitar.  Now I gave this album a 4 solely on the fact that it's different than the slipknot i'm originally used to.  So i'm still adapting to it somewhat.  This album is great in it's own right though.  So I advice people to buy this.  But don't expect Sic or anything from the past.  This isn't 9 angry guys out to just scream.  It's nine angry guys out to do something that means something.  Not saying the previous two lack depth.  But thank you, Rick Rubin.  Another great album produced.  And my advice.  Listen to this album with an open mind.  I guarantee.  It can grow on you.
B000002JR8|5.0|This is not only Pantera heaviest and best outing, but it was the first ever heavy metal album to ever debut at No.1 on the billboard charts back in 1994. It's hard to believe but Pantera were the first real heavy band to ever do that .<br />The hyperspeed opener Strength Beyond Strength is an awesome song packed with lightning fast drums, insane guitar riffs, and Phil Anselmo screaming in absolute rage. Dimebag Darrell also rips out one of his best solos ever in that song. Becoming contains some good double bass work from Vinnie Paul, and some good riffs too. 5 Minutes Alone and I'm Broken continue the non stop heaviness. Good Freinds And A Bottle Of Pills has bassist Rex Brown just ripping up his bass. Hard Lines And Sunken Cheeks is another good song with neat tempo changes and another good  solo from Darrell. Slaughtered has the death metal feel, in which Phil growls in. 25 Years, Shedding Skin keep the album in a tight pace, while Use My Third Arm is an all out assault of raging blastbeasts, freinzied riffs and more of Phil's raging vocals. Throes Of Rejection has a good bass intro from Rex, and a good solo from Darrell. After 11 tracks of pure hate, rage, and adrenaline, the boys tuck everybody in with a cover of Black Sabbath's Planet Caravan. As far as this entire album goes, you want heavy, THIS IS HEAVY!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|I don't have to tell any discriminating fan what a five star review means.  Wow look at all of the people on here that rate The Subliminal Verses up there with great albums like Led Zeppelin 4 or Rush 2112.  Be honest with yourselves and realize that even if you like this album IT IS NOT A FIVE STAR!  These are the same people that would rate Police Academy up there with Citizen Kane!<br />That being said, disappointment is an exaggerated term when it comes to this album.  If I would have wanted Stone Sour, I would have bought it.  Accoustic guitars and Slipknot go together about as well as Pat Boone and Hard Rock.  There are some disastrously bad songs on this album.  Vermillion could be enjoyed by the most ardent Jewel listener.  Expect to hear some of these songs on your Friday night Casey Kasem listener call in show about boyfriends and girlfriends breaking up.  I am just wondering if Corey's wife left him and he decided he needed to win her back with this album.<br />The knot used to be hard edged and cutting music.  The band decided to put guitar solos on this album, which they said they would not do.  All of the solos sound like Slayer knock-offs.  I am going to see Ozzfest this summer, and if they pull out any of this crap, I will be turning my back with middle fingers raised toward the stage!
B0001NBMBC|2.0|This album is very uninspired.  Almost as if they put no time in making it.  If they truly do not care about the band anymore then they should just call it quits.  I would have liked this album better as Stone Sour, not Slipknot.  Once again Rick Rubin takes another great band and tries to commercialize them.  Slipknot should not ever put an acoustic song on their albums.  Thats not what they are about.  There are a few good tracks but they are not as intricate or creative as anything they did on the past two albums.  I just hope this is their last album.
B000002BHE|5.0|I absolutely love this album!<br />--It's All Coming Back to me Now: An extended version! Beautiful song and satisfyingly long. 5/5 stars.<br />--Because you Loved Me. A masterpiece of a song, both lyrics and singing. Impeccable job, Celine. 5/5 stars.<br />--Falling into You. &quot;In your eyes, I see ribbons of color.&quot; Also a very beautiful song. 4/5 stars.<br />--Make you Happy. This upbeat song makes you happy! 5/5 stars.<br />--Seduces Me. Excellent. 4/5 stars.<br />--All by Myself. Even better. 5/5 stars.<br />--Declaration of Love. I like this song alot. The refrain is catchy. 4/5 stars.<br />--Dreaming of Love. Not the best on the CD, but not bad by any means. 3/5 stars.<br />--I Love You. &quot;These three words, they could change our lives forever...&quot; True. 4/5 stars.<br />--If that's what it Takes. AWESOME song!! 5/5 stars.<br />--I Don't Know. Also not bad. 3.5/5 stars.<br />--River Deep, Mountain High. This song rocks. 5/5 stars.<br />--Call the Man. Decent; 3/5 stars.<br />--Fly. Not quite the masterpiece some of these other tunes are, but quite decent too. 3.5/stars.<br />On the whole Celine sang this album splendidly. It's a joy to hear and a necessity for every fan's collection.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril, what can I say? Her first album was a massive hit and now she comes out with Under my Skin. Anyone into punk/rock/skate/decent music will love this. It has all the ingredients a good quality album should have. A bit of anger, a bit of happy and sad - listen to the lyrics and you can really connect with it. This is the only album you'll need this year. Get it now, and you'll know what I'm talking about

I know I never rate a song below 3 stars, but that's because Celine consistently turns out top-quality music. This album rules (as demonstrated in the ratings.) It has some truly amazing songs on it that are well worth owning to listen to often.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Just to listen to JFK and McNamara discuss the plan for the Cuban missile crissis and how close to war we really were was eye opening and a wonderful historical account and well worth the cost.<BR>To see and incredibly intelligent elder, stone faced, tears welling up in his eyes, talk about America and what we did through out not only the cold war but Vietnam is stark, gripping and an extremely important account from one of the most influentail powers in recent American history.<BR>This should be required viewing for all Americans. It's dark and depressing and the truth that we don't really want to see but history that we must never forget.

If I were to have arranged my top 15 favorite Celine songs of all time on one collection, it would have differed somewhat, but this is still incredibly good.
B00000DFSK|4.0|When I bought this compilation I already owned Boy, Unforgettable Fire, War, October, Joshua Tree, and Rattle and Hum but all on cassette so I bought this so I could have the best songs on CD. The only flaws I find is the version here of &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot; is not the one I'd heard and loved on the radio. Also it's missing &quot;Gloria&quot; and &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot;.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I know what you're thinking but all I'm gonna say is don't be narrow minded and give it a chance, you might be surprised!<br />A much more grown-up and personal album from Avril both musically and lyrically. \\"Under my skin&quot; is an album which I found easy to relate to with heartbreaking songs such as &quot;Fall to pieces&quot; and &quot;Slipped away&quot; but it also shows light at the end of the tunnel with uplifting songs like &quot;Who knows&quot;.<br />&quot;Under my skin&quot; has the same sort of set up as Avril's debut album, a mixture of slow and fast songs, however the guitar riffs are bigger, the drum beats are faster and the piano has been introduced into some of the songs. Examples of this are &quot;he wasn't&quot; which has pop punky guitars, drums and bass to which the lyrics are well suited, and &quot;I always get what I want&quot;, which you can't help but sing along to. \\"Together\\" stands out with it's effective mixture of rockier music and piano, and an orchestra even makes an appearance in \\"How does it feel\\", showing the progression of Avril's music since \\"Let go\\".  My favourite songs on the album are definitely \\"Fall to pieces\\" as it relates to what I'm going through just now and makes me feel like I'm not the only one finding things hard and &quot;slipped away&quot; also hits home as i too recently lost my grandpa.  <br />Every song is amazing, I want to talk about them all but I'd be here all day so all I'm gonna say is in my opinion it's another brilliant album by Avril, every song is worth listening to, it's more edgy and heartfelt than her first, so go buy it...now!
0679311718|5.0|Lt. General Romeo Dallaire's book, &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; is an important and compelling book. His humanity, intelligence and compassionate leadership shines through what is clearly one of the most horrifying chapters of modern African and world history. The world needs more men and women of his personal integrity and humanity.
B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere in Time is by far the most underrated album of Iron Maiden, and frankly I don't know why? I like it better than Powerslave and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.Contrary to popular believe i think that this is the best and ranks up there with Piece of Mind and Number of the Beast. This album its viewed as the futuristic album of Maiden and it shows in the way the instruments were recorded. They used synths on guitars and drums to make it sound different. But by being different it doesn't mean that is bad or terrible, because this album is filled with brilliant songwriting. Unlike St. Anger by Metallica or any album by a nu-metal band especially Slipknot. Bruce Dickinson voice is as good as it gets and he deliveres a solid vocal effort but that is expected coming from him. Highlight of this album are: EVERYTHING, although Heaven can Wait could have been a lot better but overall is a good song.<BR>The bottomline is that this album is worthy of being on a metalhead or a music fan collection. But i am sure that every Iron Maiden fan has this album by now.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Low budget horror does not get much better than &quot;The Evil Dead&quot;. In fact no other low budget horror film even looks like &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; thanks to Sam Raimi (The director of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; for the ladies and gentlemen of you out there who do not know this.) So if you want to see how a big director starts from the real bottom end of film making and works his way up then you need to watch this film at all costs. Besides he was just a young kid when he made it (using a school's 16mm film camera)..... and so were his friends who acted in it.... and they ended up making a film which coined the term &quot;video nasty'! The movie was filmed in 1979 and released in 1982 where it hit the video market just at the right time. It was one of the very first cult classics promoted by the advent of video tape.<br />`The Evil Dead' IS one of the nastiest films ever made. It contains extreme violence, blood, torture, beheadings, dismemberments, mutilations, gore, violence towards women, chain saws - all in FULL VIEW of the camera. No holds where bared in the making of this film but some countries may show this movie in a censored form which entails the removal of about six minutes from the film (This is uncut and the UK recently released it uncut). The story is original, fast paced, scary and extremely enjoyable. Many fans watch it over and over and over again. Many of today's new film making talent watch this film over and over again and it is obvious to see why.<br />The camera work is used unusually, skillfully and surprisingly (so rare these days). The editing is dramatic and the low budget special effects must be given credit for the end results which beat the pants out of some of things that hit the shelves these days. In short, the film making aspect is really what &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; is all about. Here the director is really giving you a bang for what bucks he had.<br />The premise is a simple one to explain. Five young kids go to a cabin in the woods for a short vacation. In the house they find a tape recording which manages to invoke an incantation which wakes up the evil in the woods. It comes after them - turning some of them into the undead, demons, zombies and flesh eating ghouls. Cue lots of household items being used as weapons, an initially sissy anti-hero (Bruce Campbell) who becomes the GOD of million adoring horror fans (you'll see why when you watch it and certainly the sequel is even better still!!) and low budget special effects galore. Copied by a hundred thousand other horror films, exploited by a million uncensored bootleg copies - `The Evil Dead' is still the low budget horror king. And that is a hard act to beat!the woods for a short vacation. In the house they find a tape recording which manages to invoke an incantation which wakes up the evil in the woods.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This brilliant film didn't make much of a splash in the U.S. when it appeared in theaters. On DVD, though, it's getting the attention it deserves.<br />Which makes sense, really; it's not the sort of film you grok fully after one viewing. There's a lot going on here, and some of it isn't actually explained within the movie itself. (For the SF time travel/alternate universe skeleton on which the story is hung, you'll probably need to look online for excerpts from _The Philosophy of Time Travel_, a fictional book that figures prominently in the movie.)<br />The time travel bit is pretty well worked out, and this film would be a success purely as an SF film even if that's all it were. In its time-travel logic, it's not quite as tight as the first Terminator film, but it beats the heck out of _Timecop_.<br />But it's lots of other things too: a charming late-80s period piece (with lots of music -- including a gorgeous remake of Tears for Fears' 'Mad World' -- to satisfy anybody out there who happens to be nostalgic for the 1980s); a scorching satire of public education; a dark comedy about puberty, teen angst, and psychological disorders; a comeback vehicle for Katharine Ross and Patrick Swayze; and an extended parable the moral of which is that kids had better save themselves because adults are too screwed up to do the job. (First-time director Richard Kelly wrote the script.)<br />That's a lot of balls to keep in the air -- but, amazingly, the film succeeds in _every one_ of these aspects. Its success is due in no small measure to the mesmerizing performance of Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead role; he carries the entire film on his shoulders. His real-life sister Maggie is also delightful as Elizabeth Darko, and the adult Darkos (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell) are a refreshing change of pace from the usual teen-film parents. Jena Malone, as Donnie's girlfriend Gretchen Ross, is well matched with Gyllenhaal (and this is the second time in five years that she's appeared in a movie with wormholes in it: she also played Jodie Foster's younger self in _Contact_).<br />The rest of the cast is good too -- especially Swayze, who camps it up as a smarmy self-help guru.<br />Oh, and there's the rabbit. If you're reading this page, you're surely aware that Donnie is visited by a human-sized bunny who persuades him to engage in odd behavior while he's sleepwalking. (You may be reminded of _Harvey_ at this point, but director Richard Kelly says he wasn't thinking of that film at all.)<br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, you may be thinking that a film in which a teenaged boy is visited by a giant rabbit cannot _possibly_ work. I guarantee you you'll be pleasantly surprised once you actually watch it; this one is every bit as good as you've heard it is. In its way it's every bit as mind-blowing as David Lynch's _Mulholland Dr._ -- but with a gentler, lighter touch, a fine sense of humor, and, in its way, a more hopeful message (though every bit as dark as Lynch).<br />It's being rereleased in theaters in an extended 'director's version', but the current DVD includes about twenty deleted scenes that will presumably constitute at least a lot of the additional footage. If you want to see what you've been missing, grab this one while it's still available; if a director's-cut CD is ever released, you can buy it too.

B00005JLYW|1.0|this is about as bad as it gets. I was really bored and pulled it up on my cables on demand, and I turned it off after the diving off the damn scene (which was in the first 5-8 minutes). A high budget cheesy movie is about as bad as a low budget one. This stinks, and I dont care who is in it!
B0001L3LUE|2.0|This is a disappointing attempt by Mr. McNamara to wax profound on his tenure as Secretary of Defense. The DVD does contain a few short but interesting comments about people like JFK and Castro; in general, though, it is a superficial treatment of history. I remember vividly everything about the Vietnam War and Mr. McNamara's prosecution of it; he was a true automaton who seemed to relish spouting facts and figures. He hasn't changed much. I don't know what he was attempting to do in this film other than to salve his conscience.
B00005IC2H|5.0|After listening to this album, i nearly cried, because i was so touched. Once its over you can see things so differently in the world. This is one of my favourite albums ever!!!!! I wouldnt call this music though, it a celebration of tuned sound. Anyone with an open mind in music needs this album and all of sigur ros other works. Its all brilliant and im not joking, this will stay with you forever.
B000002LFL|3.0|And you will too when you listen the this CD. Not that it's that bad, it's just a let down, a big let down. The band is sloppy, too fast, and Morrissey vocals are openly over the top playing off on some derivative of his former self. Almost as if he could care less of what is now just all a big joke. Maybe I'm being too rough but that is what it seems like! Clearly the band final days were felt. All songs are inferior to the studio versions. This opposed to Hatful of Hollow which blew the studio versions away in many cases.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|at least nothing new or at least interesing
B00005YXZH|5.0|Will be hard for Wilco to top this album. You have to believe this will be their greatest effort. One of my top 10 of all time for many of the same reasons already mentioned. Agree with the earlier review about the Jerry Garica similarities. I've always noticed this especially with their country based songs - check out Forget the Flowers from Being There for a great example. Not just the Garcia voice but the entire Grateful Dead in some cases; and this is where I think Wilco shines the most as I have always enjoyed the laid back country style of Wilco the best. Their heavier rocker type stuff always came up a bit short and out of place to me in many cases. In YHF they hit a good progressive mix in their music although it flucuates considerably within the given range. Besides the Grateful Dead, you also hear hints, styles, qualities from others as well on YHF, Radiohead effects, lots of Beatles (Ashes/ Man who loves you), others like T-rex(Kamera), Tom Petty (Trying to break), The Cure (Pot Kettle Black). Having said that, they are not over the top about it, you simply here the influences and some techniques, but Wilco's own sound dominates. Great mixture all wrapped around a Wilco core which is unique and appeciated.

0345428064|2.0|With all due respect to Andy, I think he should stick with writing true crime/non-fiction books as he did before (&quot;Immediate Action&quot; and &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;; both great, especially the latter one).  <br />There is a good thing, though, that comes out of this book.  I learned how to go into hiding, how to evade the enemy, how to conduct survaillance, how to lose people in the crowds, how to lie when checking into hotels, how to ditch cars and never use credit cards while on the run.  Not to mention how to make home-made bombs using kitchen cleaners.  It's a good guide on what to do while hiding from government agencies or 'other organizations'.  &quot;A Fugitive's Manual&quot;.  <br />Otherwise, as a fiction novel, it's not all that good.  But I still appreciate the tips!

B00000G3Q4|4.0|I've only seen this movie once, so forgive me if I'm a little skethcy on the details, but I think it's an important edition to any horror collection. It's a nasty little splatfestival, the way zombie movies should be.<br />A bunch of young people head into the woods for a bit of (what's this) camping! And right off you can tell: they're doomed. But hey, we wouldn't have it any other way. What follows is a further hour of low budget dismemberment, slicing, dicing, chopping, slashing, cutting, you name it and I'll add it to the list. Anyway, great movie, I recomend it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it needed a better plotline, and because sence I've only seen it once I can't remember it well enough. But I can remember it well enough to identify it as the best zombie movie sence Night of the living dead.
B000148KK2|5.0|I'm a big Diana Krall fan and this CD is a little different from previous ones.  However, her voice and piano playing are incredible.  You need to take the time to listen to each song to truly appreciate the artistry and the arrangement.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknot has been around for about 5 years, startling people with their wild masks and relentless death metal anthems. Now, in 2004, with the release of their third album, they unleash to the world an amazing and diverse mix of tracks that range from dark metal to emotional acoustic. Corey has great lyrical talent, and it really shows on this album. Though many metalheads and die-hard fans will criticize this album for not being hard enough and not carrying a parental advisory label, it truly shows how Slipknot have grown musically since their first release.<br />Memorable tracks include: Three Nil, Pulse of the Maggots, Vermilion Pt.2, Duality, Blister Exists.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I will keep this brief, the music sounds like a heavier Stone Sour. It also sounds as if they were holding back musically, kind of like a guy fighting with one hand tied behind his back. The CD took a departure from the 2 previous albums by way of not going all out with 100% effort or reckless abandon. Many of the tracks sound contrived or disjointed or flat out do not sound like they belong on the album. The positive thing though is there are a couple of songs that do warrant a listen and make the album bearable. To be honest, this was not my cup of tea and wish that I would not have purchased this album. Listen before you buy. The album was produced by Rick Rubin who usually does pretty good work with bands that have the capacity to put out melody or have strong singers. Slipknot is not necessarily about normal melody and their singer is limited in terms of vocal capacity. Not to say that SK is talentless or anything of the sort, they just have a niche that they fill out very well and any departure from that is detrimental. Ross Robinson realized what slipknot was supposed to sound like and emphasized their strong points which really worked out well for the first 2 albums. My guess is the next album will probably be the make or break album. Hope this helped.

B0001Z363W|5.0|Alright, by now we've all realized that Zakk is one of the premier guitarists around today.  His last few albums have been very hard, very heavy, and dripping with his unmatched guitar sound.  Zakk is a virtuoso.  The fact that he put out this album, is nothing less than virtuosic.  Zakk is telling us that he can do absolutely anything with Black Label Society and it will sound absolutely amazing.  He makes sure we remember who he is with the song Takillya (Esytabon) - very Speedballesque... Zakk is one of the greatest guitarists of all time.  The songs are slower and much lighter, but it's these aspects which make the album incredible.  Zakk doesn't have to play so hard all the time, he can change it up.  Unlike common criticisms of Yngwie (claiming he plays the exact same all the time and it gets boring), Zakk Wylde never, ever gets boring.  This album is just what we needed after the last one, which was so intense that we needed a rest, a nice breather - Hangover Music, Vol. 6 does just that.  Bravo Zakk &amp; Black Label Society.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Sure this isnt the old heavy as f**k slipknot, but it still kick some ass. Its still has their sick and twisted style and they will never lose that twisted style. And for u fags who say it sounds like Stone Sour you need to shut the f**k up. You dont know what your talking about.

B000006NPY|3.0|Adore is not a Smashing Pumpkins album. Billy Corgan even said so himself. He said people are wrong if they consider this either an acoustic or electronic album, and I can see where he's coming from. This release was torn to shreds by critics, and I can see where they were coming from as well. Corgan was always considered a bone head because he didn't want to go in the direction other people wanted him and his band to go into, and I still admire him for it. With Adore this is all about his prose. This is more about the lyrics than the music bringing it out. Almost every track is soaked in dark romance, and I thought this was very interesting. As for the techno aspect, which Mellon Collie hinted at with the tracks Love, 1979, and Beautiful, it was fair, but what really stank was the fact that Jimmy Chamberlain wasn't with the band at the time due to a past scandal and numerous drug problems which led to his shall we say unemployment, and his absence showed dramatically, thus making the album a non-Pumpkins effort. Basically, if you are a fan of the early material, don't bother, but if you love the band to its core, wanting to see them evolve musically and lyrically, pick it up. It's worth the fifteen or so bucks.
B0000C1733|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are the iconographic band of the last 25 years.  As has been (correctly) in previous posts and reviews, to do a true RHCP hits album would require at least 2, probably more like 3 disks.  Essentially, everone looking for that sort of thing would be better off with a boxed set of their work (which, unfortunately, doesn't exist).  The problem is that the Pepper's stuff is highly contextual to their albums and segregating things out, at a certain lever, diminishes their effect.<br />Yet, paradoxically, a lot of their stuff also works as stand alone material.  That is amply demonstrated by this disk.  <br />This is not really an historical collection, it's a collection of fairly recent material.  And, strictly speaking, it's not really even a hits album--if it were, such hits as Aeroplane would have to be included.<br />However, the sequencing of the songs works, the songs themselves do truly represent a pretty good cross section of their last several albums, and the bottom line is that the peppers, in vitually any format you want to concoct for their mater, rock big time.<br />So, until that boxed set appears on the horizon, this'll do.
B000000WJZ|5.0|The first time I had listened to SD, it was when I occasionally stole the tape from my sister's shelf and immersed myself in the awesome sound. I was ten. Now I'm old enough to absorb more of its alternative energy such as Chamberlain's power drumming, Iha and D'Arcy's guitar riffs and Corgan's unique, sometimes introspective lyrics, but mostly sweet defiance. This is truly one of their best albums, and the album that ultimately put them on the map. I recommend it to anyone, rock fan or not.
B000005H7D|5.0|Ok, that is really bad.<br />But this cd is amazing.  Right now I am in my Coltrane period.  And I find Jazz to be the most personal of music.  The players seem more human, more vulnerable, and there is a connection to the music that I get out of no other, classical is nice, but a little more removed.  This is music  of nightclubs, of angst and wonder.<br />I have written before about the small moments of Jazz being heartstopping.  And there are great moments, a song called Moments Notice for one, but much has been written for good reason about the inspired playing of Coltrane.  He is a man on fire, a true combination of flame, passion and melody.<br />It is also said that Coltrane played way above his sidemen, but I think the other work here is amazing.<br />Like most instrumental music, it is visceral, subjective and alive.<br />You should give it a try.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I've been a slipknot fan since I heard &quot;Wait &amp; Bleed&quot; shortly after their self-titled lp was released. This basically how it breaks down:<br />Slipknot - The first attack in a looming war, the one that rallies the troops.<br />Iowa - The entire war. The air strikes, ground battles, firefights, the shelled out building, soldiers lying dead in the streets.<br />Vol. 3 - This album is the aftermath of a war thats been waging for far to long and needs to come to an end. We're almost there, we've won, we just need to press on a bit longer.<br />The underlying theme here is one of rebuilding. After years of being torn apart, the band feels reborn, and revitalized. There are your typical skipknot moments but they're infused with not only the sense of immediacy of past albums but also a sense of calm not heard before. There are also somber moments, acoustic guitars and melodic strings back corey on a few tracks. Yes, people are going to say its half slipknot, half stone sour, but i think in doing stone sour, corey taylor realized that metal and melody could coexhist with amazing results. It takes alot of courage for a band like slipknot to put out an album like this, and I applaude them for it, it echoes growth and maturing, which is something I cant say about their peers. Plus Rick Rubin is the best producer on the planet, as proven once again here (You can hear EVERYONE!).
B00000JLWW|4.0|This is a really great movie.  My fav of all time, but they really need to come out with a special edtion DVD.  The speical features really SUCKED on the recent one and many people who would have bought it but were boreder line probaly decide not to buy it because there were not that great of features.  All I am saying is that the moive makers would highly benifit from this. They would make millions and please many fans my self include.  So please if you have any power what so ever in this matter please convince someone that this a good idea.      <br />PS: it would be great if they started ad's for the movie very soon so people will antipatit it more and you might get a few people to go buy the recent DVD to remind them selfs how the moive plays out.  please help me<BR>             from a desparte Titanic fan

B000003TAB|5.0|Incesticide is just amazing.  Even the name, &quot;Incesticide&quot;, is clever. In my opinion the highlights are Dive, Sliver, Turnaround, Son of a Gun, Molly's lips (the covers of Vaselines songs are really some of the best) and Aneurysm. Seriously though, listen to all the songs on this album.  Even if you're not a Nirvana fan, you'll probably think it's great. Kurt Cobain was a brilliant songwriter and his voice has no comparison.  Buy this album if you dont already own it! <br />RIP Kurt Cobain
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne has arrived on the scene setting herself apart from the rest of the pop princesses out there. Her music, as well as her image takes on a harder side than what most of us think when we think pop.  This change comes as a relief to me, finnaly seeing someone like her able to get out there and get a record deal.  Throughout my 15 years, I have distinctly avoided pop because of the image it gets as prep music and have had a better appreciation for rock as I am a musician my self.  I have made my exception with Avril.  Her lyrics touch base on a lot of problems the typical (but what is typical) teenager has.  She also puts herslef into the album with songs like &quot;Mobile&quot; where she tells of how she has to keep moving and never gets to settle down.  It's song like these that remind us that being a star isn't all that it's cracked up to be, no matter what they want you to think.  <BR>Musically, I give it five stars for some exellent variation ranging from the hyped up &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; to the slowed down &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;I'm with you&quot;. Personally, they have overplayed &quot;Complicated&quot; on the radio waaaaay to much, but if it gets people to buy this album, I'm alright with it.  But don't just buy this for that single.  There are so many better things than that song, and I'm sure Avril would agree with me. (she must be sick of performing that song by now anyways) <BR>The reason why I did not give this freshman album a full five is this- I don't think this is her best.  I believe she can give out more and more and this CD is just the tip of her iceberg.  GO FOR IT AVRIL!! I am looking foward to your next cd, which I think I should go and buy sooner or later.<BR>If Avril Lavigne turns out to be a fad, I'll still be an old hippie whom is still a fan. O yes by the way, Evan, Matt and Mark, you guys play some good stuff too. I had to put you guys in there.<BR>Just go and get the CD, I think more people besides me will take a closer look at this sk8ter girl, and even pop overall. Thanks Avril.
B00009XITP|3.0|&quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is exactly the film for the teens who love Amanda Bynes, or &quot;what a girl wants.&quot;  It is unashamedly sweet and predictable, but to say so and blame the film for it is pointless, because the film knows the fact.<br />Interestingly, the film is based on one Rex Harrison film &quot;The Reluctant Debutante&quot; (1958), which follows the story of an American girl in English high society.  Like that oldie, &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is avout a girl Daphne played by Bynes, whose &quot;single&quot; mother (Kelly Preston) is a wedding singer.  One day, when Daphne is 17 years-old, she suddely wants to see her real father Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), who is going to be a MP, and marry a lady (Anna Chancellor, &quot;Duckface&quot; in &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot;).<br />No surprise that Daphne causes a havoc in the aristocratic society in UK; and no surprise that she wins the heart of some people there, especially that of Colin Firth and Eileen Atkins.  Well, the director Dennie Gordon's CV includes &quot;Ally McBeal,&quot; and the gags are often preposterous, and dialogues impossible, though in a delightful way ... if you're in a good mood.<br />But the natural charms of Ms. Bynes goes unscathed among the hit-and-miss shots, and certainly the chemistry between Bynes and Firth is undeniable, and compensates the wasted Jonathan Pryce and the ill-used leather jacket and turban Colin Firth had to wear.<br />I do understand the British people's dismay when watching the film -- it is often gratingly silly, but the Dashwood family (oh, they are really living in the house the film depicted) actually agreed to use the name, so stop complaining, please.  And to American audiences, true, the film is sugar-coated, but when you know it is, you cannot complain that it is too sweet.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from Slipknot after a few years off from Iowa. I loved Slipknot, most of Iowa, and I always liked a part of Mate, Feed, Kill Repeat as it showed more of the talents and musicanship. Thankfully Vol 3. is everything I wanted and more! Jim and Mick are finally showing some great leads, and riffs that are really groovey. This of course is coming from a guitarist prospective. After hearing this album for about two weeks now I can honestly say I can't stop listening to it. I have a few stand-out tracks which most seem to not like however I like them and that is all that matters to me. Opium for the People, Welcome, the every haunting Vermilion (one of my fav) the 1st version. Corey's voice is finally coming through. The drumming is just as good as any of the other albums. But Corey, Jim, and Mick have def come through! Dark, scary, to experimental riffs. I love it! Thank you guys for bringing something I've wanted for such a long time. It is very refreshing and I swear Ross Robinson was holding them back from what they really had. You can't say Slipknot's roots were just two or three chords. If you listen to the older demos, and MFKR you'd think otherwise. It is just as heavy but has more twists and turns. Def. one of the albums that I'm glad I paid for.
B00000DGUG|5.0|This album just floors me everytime I listen to it.  It's a pulsating, epic, emotional work.  You feel Alanis bleeding in every single song.  You feel her searching, you feel her crying, it's an amazing experience.  DON'T BE FOOLED!  It's not nearly as inaccesible as some want you to think!  The melodies are as memorable as ever, and there are qualitites that are absolutely timeless.  To call this album great would be an understatement.  HOW DID IT TAKE ME SO LONG TO CATCH ON TO HER??!!
0064430227|5.0|There's something about Crockett Johnson (real name David Johnson Leisk) that is instantly recognizable.  Like Matt Groening of \\"The Simpsons\\" fame, Johnson had a particular style of drawing that was both simple and infinitely adaptable.  Though he drew the comic strip \\"Barnabus\\" and the incredibly simple, \\"The Carrot Seed\\", it is \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\" that won Johnson the fame he has today.  The story has been ripped off a million times in a million different ways, but we can all credit this original as the first of the first.  All hail that spunky Harold and his oh-so purple crayon.<br /><br />When we first meet Harold he and his magical purple crayon are already well acquainted.  No picture in this book appears that Harold does not draw himself (aside from Harold himself).  Our intrepid hero sets off on a series of small adventures that are both intentionally and unintentionally caused by his crayon.  Drawing everything from the moon (which makes a point to appear on every single page that Harold finds himself on) to dragons to flying balloons to a policeman, Harold has a gay old time.<br /><br />Wanna hear a petty complaint?  A petty, insignificant, hardly-worth-listening-to complaint?  Okay, here goes..... it bothers me that Harold's crayon never gets smaller.  By logical extension it should, shouldn't it?  Of course, by logical extension I should remember that this is, after all, a MAGIC purple crayon.  Maybe magic crayons don't get smaller.  Obviously I don't know the rules that govern crayons particularly well.  If I did I wouldn't be having these problems.  In any case, that's my only objection to this book.  It is, I know from personal experience, a heavily adored and respected story.  People will carry copies of this book with them all their lives.  There is something about Harold and his tiny adventures that speaks to the hearts of millions.  If you've never had the pleasure of reading a Crockett Johnson book, this is the place to start.  If you have read this book, read it again.  It's just that good.read this book, read it again.  It's just that good.

B000001FA4|5.0|*The fourth Cd of U2's musical emporium, Unforgettable fire reveals a transition from War into Joshua Tree.<BR>  <BR>  *It can be said of &quot;War,&quot; that the album was and is the apex of U2's political [rawness] in sound and lyrical style.  Unforgettable fire has a phoenix like emergence from the ashes sensibility as the majority of its songs are in the key (or chord) of C, a regretful, longing chord . . . and usually melt into the G chord which evokes resolution and completion.<BR>  <BR>  *U2 for most listeners are the bards of political issues that become metaphors for the heart and personal relationships.<BR>  <BR>  *It can be said in a critical eye that as the band has progressed from its humble beginnings, they have lost their edge, (no pun intended) in dynamically representing the political turmoil of their or anyone else's homeland . . .<br />  *Unforgettable fire is the exempt of this criticism, since its creation was in the throngs of U2's involvement with conflicts in their country(s) as well as their own personal lives.<BR>  <BR>  *Brina Eno and Daniel Lanois do an incredible job producing, adding soft 80's synth and great echo and reverb.<BR>  <BR>  #1, Sort of Homecoming, the first song on the CD, is a longing tune about returning to what was once known, and a permanent hiatus that changes home to a place no longer home, and the regret of the movement.  The song is a perfect harbinger for the tone and aesthetic set for the rest of the CD.<br />  #2, Pride is an incredible anthem that undoubtedly most have heard on the radio over the years, if not on the conglomerate best album.  The song lyrically draws artistic similarities between the Historical and Christian Jesus with Martin Luther King.<BR>  <BR>  #4, Unforgettable fire reminds me of a traveling ballad where old friends meet at an inn at twilight after a crossing the Gaelic lands.  Bono serendanes an eeire falsetto, as the bard element here is clear and poignant, giving depth and meaning to the lyrics and melodies.<BR>  <BR>  #6, Bad is a great breakup song, as I listened to it in my adolescence almost religiously during one of my first breakups.  All relationships have emotional turmoil which often results in time apart from each other to dwell on what was done.  All of the members of U2 have a relationship with Dublin, the city (or town) this was written on.  Wonderful allegory in this song.<BR>  <BR>  #7, Indian Summer is an awesome fall-song about reminiscing of the summer and settling down into the tempo of fall.  I love how U2 utilizes the seasons in classic romantic style.<br />  *All in all, a wonderful CD with powerful statements and allegory whether you agree with them or not.  It is as effectual as it is full of energy and meaning.  It is as calming as it is thought provoking and invigorating.<BR> <BR>  *This album is a must-have with the best of.  It certainly is worth buying because of the omissions this CD contains from the Best of.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I find this CD INFINITELY better than her debut. She delivers on her potential and then some. That being said, you can tell she's still growing. But she has grown by leaps and bounds. Ms. Keys is sort of caught between two arenas, and she does a good job of co-existing between the popular music arena and the actual artistic MUSIC. As far as real artistry, she's still growing. But in the pop arena, she's definitely a leader, because she is truly an ARTIST, not just another person cast from a mold. Around song 8, this album becomes less popish and more... different. But in a good way. <br />As for comparing this CD with Songs in A Minor, I think this album overall is better, whereas the hits from Songs (Fallin, A Woman's Worth) are more classic than the hits from Diary (You Don't Know My Name, If I Ain't Got You). I think this album is a MUCH better buy overall for those who have been living under a rock and haven't bought Ms. Keys's CDs yet. <br />I love this CD. One of my favorites in my collection. She has a nice voice, but the best part of this CD is how everything comes together. It's just great. <br />1. Harlem's Nocturne- 7\10: Pretty good... not my favorite... but very good, and her piano playing is wonderful. <br />2. Karma- 6\10: Another pretty good. I like it, but it's a but manufactured for my tastes<br />3. Hearburn- 7\10: Hmm... I think they should've saved this material for the next CD when she's slightly more mature as a singer, but still a great song. It's funny and ligththearted and fun. This is a great song for background music at a party.<br />4. If I Was Your Woman- 8\10: Having never heard the orignal, I can't really complement fairly on this song, but I like it. She puts a hip-hop-ish spin on it, and its a very groove-able song, for lack of a better word<br />5. You Don't Know My Name- 9\10: In my opinion this is perhaps Ms. Keys second best song from either this album or the last. Very good. And her voice shines on this song.<br />6. If I Ain't Got You- 10\10: It was a good choice to release this as a single. It's not quite commercial, but it still makes money on the charts. The piano especially is beautiful. And it has a nice message. <br />7. Diary- 8\10: Nice collaboration. There's nothing wrong with it, it's just not as good as some stuff on the album<br />8. Dragon Days- 10\10: I don't care what people say, this is one of my favorite songs on the CD. It goes in a different direction than the rest of the CD, but it's a great departure. It's kinda funky, and I like it alot. <br />9. Wake Up- 10\10: This is a great one as well. Beautful. A cross between an anti-wat song and a love song. Wonderful! Yet another favorite. Definitely a favorite. Especially the bridge, which is awesome. <br />10. So Simple- 5\10: My least favorite. It's kinda... blah. When Alicia Keys herself is singing it's great, but the sound effects are just unneccesary and they bring the song down. <br />11. When You Really Love Aomeone- 7\10: Very good. I like this song. It's a bit derrivitive of Woman's Worth in my opinion, but still pretty good. <br />Feeling U, Feeling Me- 8\10: A good song. A bit meloncholy? It's not good or bad. It like, depends on what kind of mood you're in for this song. <br />13. Slow Down-  10\10: A big favorite. One of the best songs on the CD in my opinion. Great melody line. Sweet. <br />14. Sampsonite Man- 8\10: Great lyrics. Her voice sounds good on this kind of song<br />15. Nobody Not Really- 10\10: The best song on the CD. It's interesting, sharp, quick, wonderful. I love this song. My favorite!! Great.

B0001NBMBC|3.0|hey maggotts , i don't know what's happened in houdini's manion... i belive that the presence had discombned all the equalization of the master tape, because i can't bilive how f==kin ugly sonds this album... Rick rubin is a good producer , and he worked good with SOAD an mudvayne so why he choose to use a so horrible and vintage sound setting, there are only midlle range frequencies!!! So the guitars cover all the other istrument,the bass seems to be unhearable, the drums sounds so metallic that is difficult to distingue them from the percussion, the turntables and samples are also low, in this way the mixing kills all the real and unique power of slipknot , turning their sound close to stone sour... LET'S TRY THIS TIP... buy the cd...copy the tracks on yor PC, find a sound editing program, (4 example cool edit) apply a equalization filter, rise up the subwoofer , bass and the highest frequencies , lowering a bit the high-middle ranges , burn a cd , AND IT INCREDIBLY SOUNDS HEAVIER!!! you have finally in your hands the real new cd of SLIPKNOT!<br />P.S. in this way ill' rate it about 4 stars and half... i'm actually trying to digest the acustic ballads
1400031362|3.0|I am a huge fan of Alexander McCall Smith and I find the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series overall to be extremely heartfelt and compelling. The characters are so unique and each chapter seems to bring a smile to my face. No sex. No violence. No profanity. Yet I find myself wanting more. How amazing.<br />Yet Morality for Beautiful Girls is a noticeably weaker effort than the first two. The title is bland and hard to remember. You get well past page 100 before the beauty contest contestants are even introduced and there is only one chapter involving the poisoning case early on. So there isn't much detecting going on. Honestly, there isn't much of anything going on and the reader almost becomes as depressed as a certain major character, waiting for something, anything to happen.<br />To me, Smith stumbles this out. Not in a major way, but after the joy of the first two Precious tales, this time around things seem  a bit too dark in Botswana and some of the joy seems to be missing.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|...I guess I don't need to see anymore Tim Burton movies. Funny what a decade can do, huh? Stylistically, I feel like I'm done seeing him rummage through the same ol' bag of tricks, and storytelling-wise, I guess I now realize I was never really impressed. Granted, part of the problem this time isn't his fault. I thought the novel Big Fish was corny and obvious. And I find Ewan McGregor's performance to be way too.... Gumpish... for my tastes. But still, I unfortunately see Big Fish not only as a bad movie but a bad indicator of where Burton is headed as an artist.

0062502182|4.0|In the fable told by Paul Coelho, the character Santiago is a shepherd boy who dreams of treasures in Egyptian pyramids and leaves spain to make his dreams turn true. During his adventure, he learns many lessons on way and experiences the truth 'To listen to own heart' It knows all and explores to fulfil dream desires. Santiago meets many people but among them is a Alchemist who has a wise preach to Santiago. When Santiago confides in the Alchemist what he thinks, the Alchemist says that the fear of suffering is more than to actually 'suffer'. The fable is an inspiration to live upto dreams and live life fulfilling desires. If you do not dream you cannot reach for the stars and so does Paul Coelho has sound advice to make the most of inner aspirations and pick the pearls in life. Paul stress on importance of life and listening to our heart. We travel life's path once and hence, our aim should be higher to grasp and reach the goals to fulfil our dreams desire. A very good message and worth a Read - A great pick and must for bedside shelf.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne is quite simply one of the worst new artist to come out in recent years. This is in no way an improvement on her debut. She has labeled this as being &quot;Deeper and more emotional&quot;, yet the lyrics here are not the least bit more mature than those of her debut (although nothing here is NEARLY as cringe-inducing as &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot;) People, if you didn't like &quot;Let Go&quot;, don't buy this expecting to be pleasantly surprised. You'll be miserably disapointed!
B000002KKS|5.0|1980's Heaven and Hell stands as my favorite Black Sabbath album, PERIOD. It has more melody than previous albums (with maybe an exception of Sabotage and SBS (my two other favorites), and Dio and the band really shine. Too bad the band seems to want to forget about this period and not acknoWledge its greatness. This is the Black Sabbath album that KILLS NU METAL SHEEP who pick it up expecting Ozzy. Dio is a MUSICIAN, Ozzy is a VOCALIST who has had alot of stuff ghostwritten for him anyway (Bob Daisley anyone?). If you're into metal, you probably own this already!
B00008BXJG|5.0|AC/DC's final effort with singer Bon Scott, and their 4th album release (not counting the Australian versions of T.N.T. and High Voltage) is AC/DC's finest album of all time. What makes it so good is new producer John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, who improved Bon Scott's vocal sound, making it raw and raspy. He really took a leap above Vanda and Young's producing with this album- he really made the &quot;gang&quot; choruses sung by Malcolm and Cliff more prominent. This is what made a great album even better, in my opinion. The slick production. The songs are great, too, including their radio hit &quot;Highway to Hell&quot;, and others such as &quot;Shot Down In Flames&quot; and &quot;Girls Got Rhythm&quot;. &quot;If You Want Blood (You've Got It)&quot; is also a great tune with a nice chorus. Not really a weak track on here. All killer, no filler. AC/DC sounds their wildest on this album and Bon sounds like a madman! His lyrics on here still haven't lost any of their bite. And soon after this album Bon died, which is a sad thing, because even though AC/DC was great with Brian Johnson, they were even better with Bon. It was a sad and dissapointing thing, his death. And for this new Digipak reissue and remaster, it is great. I have the LP version and this sounds just as great, if not better. The sound is crisp, with good bass and drum sounds. It also comes with a 16 page booklet with liner notes and rare photos from the band. It's too bad the booklet dosn't come with lyrics for all the songs, but you can easily find them on the internet. for the digipak, it wears easily, but looks nice and is very attractive. This album is a excellent first choice for those new to AC/DC, and a must own veteran fans of the band (who most likely already have it in some form or another) Happy listening, and Malcolm rocks!
B000002G7G|5.0|This is a must own for classic rock fans.  It is, in my opinion, one of the five greatest albums from the sixties. This is in no particular order, they are all five equally essential     1) Let It Bleed---The Rolling Stones                            2) Bringing It All Back Home---Bob Dylan                        3) Revolver---The Beatles                                       4) Highway 61 Revisited---Bob Dylan                             5) The Velvet Underground---The Velvet Underground
B000063COX|5.0|Note that THIS is the Iron Maiden CD that I started with. No Number of the Beast, folks. It took a little bit to get used to the Maiden sound, but it was an absolute grower and now I can't get enough of it.<br />After a much-requested (by the fans) Soundhouse Tapes release, Maiden knew they had their work cut out for them to make their debut LP. So they did, recording it in 1979 and making it ready for release by early 1980. It was an awsome fusion of melodic rock, punk, and heavy metal, and it certainly showed what was to come for Maiden- if their debut was this good, what could come next? This lineup was one of Maiden's earliest album-wise, it had the rough and tumble Paul Di'Anno vocals (no high pitched stuff here- well, maybe a little, hehe) and original guitarist Dennis Stratton and drummer Clive Burr. Sadly this would be Stratton's last LP with Maiden. I usually don't do track-by-track reviews, but since this album is so good, I think I will. <br />Prowler- An awsome opener! Wouldn't think of anything else opening off this terrific CD. It's fast, tough, and has good guitar licks courtesy of Dave Murray and Maiden's old guitarist Dennis Stratton. Features some ripping solos in the middle. Funny but questionable lyrics, has a good song title though. Maiden hooks you with this song, and sets the tempo for the rest of the record. Greatness. 5/5<br />Sanctuary- Originally released shortly after this album as a single, Sanctuary is sometimes cut down by fans, but I, for one, love it. It just chugs along with some good backbone by drummer Clive Burr and bassist (our man!) Steve Harris. I like the lyrics alot- (&quot;Out of the winter came a warhorse of steel, I'd never killed a woman before but I know how it feels&quot;). Don't know why this song is so cut down by some people. The only bonus track on this reissue CD. 5/5<br />Remember Tommorow- Whoa. This is a knockout- you just have to hear it! Sometimes melodic, sometimes hard, but it rocks like no other. Memorabletrack. 5/5<br />Running Free- Don't like this too much- I think it is overrated, but that's just my opinion. It just dosn't rock that hard to me and dosn't go along at nice pace. Sort of boring too me, but still OK. Live staple, still to this day. 2.5/5<br />Phantom of the Opera- Best song off the album, and with good reason. Unbelieveable composition by Harris, it goes through alot of tempo changes and also features some firing and melodic guitar solos by Murray, plus the mean intro riff. Essential listening- you just have to hear the live version on Live After Death- awsome! 5/5<br />Transylvania- Fairly memorable instrumental track- it's great and I think the album wouldn't feel complete without a burning instrumental. Follows up Phantom of the Opera very well. 4/5<br />Strange World- MOST UNDERRATED TRACK OF THE ALBUM! Simply love this song- just because it's not heavy dosn't mean it isn't great- full of beautiful solos by Murray, great singing by Paul Di'Anno and solid bass by Harris. One of my favorites off the album. 5/5<br />Charlotte the Harlot- The sole Dave Murray composition off the album- he did the lyrics and the music. Starts off heavy and fast with funny lyrics, then has a tempo change, and what- back to the original opening riff! Can't help but like this song. 5/5<br />Iron Maiden- Pretty overrated too, but it's Maiden's signature track, and they do it at almost every concert. It is very memorable with the chorus, but not a very good long term song. Good, but not great. 3.5/5<br />As for the new 2002 remaster/reissue, well, I haven't heard the old one but as far as sound quality (it was remastered by Simon Heyworth at Chop 'em Out in 1998, and he, with Robert Fripp, also remastered the entire King Crimson catalogue in SACD and they sound unbelieveable. He does an excellent job) and packaging, it is great. It comes with some slightly informative notes (major dates in for the band in 1980) and full lyrics, plus some great photos. Also contains original album and singles artwork and comes with a slipcase. No complaints. It is well done and the Enhanced CD portion comes with two live videos (from 1981 I think- Live at the Rainbow, with Adrian Smith) plus complete tour dates and some more rare photos and info. <br />I would say this Maiden CD is simply essential and will be in my head (and CD player) for a long time. It is certainly one of metal's all-time best debuts.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|when i listened to the first thirty seconds of this album i felt chills go up my spine, just like when i discovered the self-titled album all those years ago.  this is probably one of most finely crafted albums one can ever come across.  at the same time i felt a pang of heartache as i knew this would be a difficult album to get across to the people.  on one hand we have the kids who like to wear black hooded sweatshirts and those wide-legged jeans, who flaunt their depression through their &quot;korny&quot; one dimensional music.  although the first slipknot album (the self-titled not MFKR) is awesome it leans more to that nu-metal side than iowa and most definitely vol 3; and it's what these dweebs swear by.  truth is they aren't bright enough, at least in a  cognitive musical sense to enjoy something that doesn't have to do with the lowest four notes on the guitar and the most rageful screaming that can be mustered in the span of a song.  they will not understand the brilliance...yes, brilliance of this album and will continue listening to bands that aspire to compose like slipknot. in the same vein there are those who are put off by the masks and earlier work of slipknot...as it's &quot;too nu-metal&quot; and not enough like vintage metallica.  they may have the capacity to love this album...but aren't expecting anything new out of the band so haven't a reason to check this album out.  to anyone reading this who is curious let me tell you that this album has it all.  there is a maturity that wasn't always present in their last two releases that bolsters the lyrics and music with seriously deep meaning.  most importantly of course is the songcraft which i can tell you from the viewpoint of a trained musician, is incredibly creative and complex.  the sampling and turntables have been more fully and effectively integrated into the songs, which gives the songs an edge irreplicable by other bands.  mick and jim's guitar work has been reconstructed into being a formidable pair of lead guitarists...often playing very different yet complimentary lines, something not so often done on the other records.  as always mr jordison's drumming is flashy yet tight.  maybe most poignant on the album are corey taylor's vocals, which have always been strong but have taken on an incredible evocativeness.  the subtlety he uses on the opening track with very understated, almost vulernable singing is simply bone-chilling.  open-minded, musically-aware rock fans should be blown away by this album.  truly incredible.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I have been waiting almost a year for there new cd. I read a review in a magazine in MAY of 2003 that they were going to be recording new music and that they hoped to get the new cd out in September of 2003. Never happened as I waited till October. I heard they would release it in December of 2003. Never happened. Now in May of 2004 on May 25 there new cd \\"Volume 3 The Subliminal Verses\\" was released. I like the song \\"Durality\\" and that song is awesome. If you liked Joey's drumming in the last two cd's wait till you here this cd. <br />I read out of magazines about it and saw pictures of there new masks and I thought this was going to be heavier then the last one by what there masks looked like. There masks are way cooler. <br />This is way different then both albums. Stonesour has changed Corey, but Murderdolls has not really changed Joey. No screaming. No parental advisory. At first I thought it was a joke. Now when I hear Corey I think of Stonesour and I don't want to. I want to think of Slipknot.<br />You have to listen to this cd two times to actually get use to there new sound. The first time you concentrate more on Corey's vocals but the second listen you start to realize that it's still good. You pay more attention to the drumming abd the guitar and realize that not everything has chnaged. They also brought back the turntable which is used in most of the songs. One big change is that there are no swear words at all. I think its cool though.<br />It now feautures acoustic guitar and a little violin in two songs. More guitar playing kind of like old Metallica. <br />1-Prelude 3.0-(3:57)-10/10<BR>2-The Blister Exists-(5:19)-10/10<BR>3-Three Nil-(4:48)-9/10<BR>4-Duality-(4:12)-10/10<BR>5-Opium of the People-(3:12)-8/10<BR>6-Circle-(4:22)-10/10<BR>7-Welcome-(3:15)-10/10<BR>8-Vermilion-(5:16)-10/10<BR>9-Pulse of the Maggots-(4:19)-10/10<BR>10-Before I Forget-(4:38)-8/10<BR>11-Vermilion PT.2-(3:44)-9/10<BR>12-The Nameless-(4:27)-9/10<BR>13-The Virus of Life-(5:25)-10/10<BR>14-Danger, Keep Away-(3:20)-8/10
B0001HAISG|5.0|I loved this movie. Loved it.<BR>WETA Digital quality CGI this was not, but despite what could be called \\"crude\\" CGI (let's say, rather, \\"obvious\\"), this movie is just first class. The acting from the children is impressive, the story the most faithful to Barrie's original (EVER), and the characters cast the most faithful to Barrie's original (EVER). So with this formula, we get a wonderful story, acted beautifully.<BR>Jeremy Sumpter's Peter Pan is just perfect, with a dreamy wide-eyed look, and the right mix of cockiness and innocence that Peter Pan was meant to exude. Let's face it, he wasn't this angel-innocent little boy. He was cocky and proud and smart-alecky, and a formidible swordsman and ace flyer, and, boy, he KNEW it.<BR>Jason Isaacs' dual role as Mr Darling and Captain Hook (Wendy's psyche's evil creation of her father, didn't you know?) is perfect. Never before have we seen portrayed the perfect Cpt Hook, and now, here we have him at last - dashingly good-looking, silky, sophisticated (he uses the most extensive vocab of all his pirates, and look at that waistcoat embroidery!), obsessive, dauntless and downright vicious... and, em, look at the interaction between Hook and Wendy... it's disturbing if you think about it.<BR>What Hogan has done is rightfully refocus this film onto Wendy. It may be titled \\"Peter Pan\\" but it is Wendy's imagination we're exploring - her fears, her desires, her fantasy. Hook has to be destroyed because she is killing off the tyrant of her father, the threat to her imagination and ultimately the force that would rape her innocence. <BR>What we are given is a fabulous tale of a crossroads - we are right at that point in life where childhood cares are being grown out of, and adulthood looms frighteningly ahead. We can all hearken back to these days and identify with these children.<BR>Points to watch for that shows Hogan's genius in adaptation: <BR>-Wendy and Peter's fairy dance<BR>-Cpt Hook's final invitation to Wendy to join asa Pirate<BR>-The retelling of Nana's exile into the backyard (Wendy's school hiatus)<BR>Down points (demerits) - the too long \\"I do believe in fairies! I do! I do!\\" sequence. One great thing is that it shows that Hook is TOTALLY immune to the lures and influence of Peter Pan, where the rest of the world is not;<BR>And the demise of Hook - too immature for one of his calibre. Ought to have been left to the original end where he is able to \\"triumph\\" over Pan, Hook having not left good form in battle (though, Cpt Hook really cheats, but it clears his conscience);<BR>The original ending not left in. Maybe they ran out of money. Who knows, but it ought to have remained.<br />So, thank goodness for Victorians to give us such disturbing glimpses into sexual psychology! Who else would have created such a fabulous, timeless tale? Wonderful, really.
B00004RF9B|5.0|I can't add anything more what has already been said about this incredible film.  With a number of &quot;updated&quot; films currently produced from previous ones i.e. &quot;The Thing&quot;, is anyone interested or brought up the question of new version of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;?
B0000AUHOH|4.0|The Good Captain and his crew finally get some shore leave and we begin the movie in beautiful Yosemite National Park - a very uplifting idea from the start, that Yosemite Park will survive into the 23rd Century!<br />I'm dismayed that if one reviewer/critic (oh, let's say Roger Ebert) wants to boldly label this movie THE WORST of the six starring the original cast, that everyone else feels obligated to nit-pik it to death. Remember, this movie came out the same time as BATMAN and perhaps we were all turning to the dark side anyway. I do, however, remember seeing this movie in a packed theatre and the audience enjoying it as much as the others in the series.<br />Yes, this movie IS sentimental.  Yes, the money DID run short (if you listen to the commentaries of all the Star Trek movies, all the directors were forced by the studios to do much with little compared to Robert Wise!) and some production values suffered. Yet I much prefer it to Star Trek VI because so much of the enjoyment for me are the ACTORS interacting in character.  The themes of brotherhood, blind loyalty, blind faith, facing your own fears and the question of just where GOD is are addressed on grand scale as well as gently.  That's a huge undertaking.  This is as introspective as I've seen the brothers Kirk, Spock and McCoy get.  Toss in some silliness and sweetness, and it makes for great entertainment. It's very close to what one of the better episdoes of Star Trek (The original series)was like. William Shatner as director also gives each actor known in the series a featured scene as well. So lighten up, people.  Go climb a rock! Then enjoy the Commentary by William & his daughter Liz Shatner when you watch it the second time!
B000089CJI|4.0|i normally don't listen to the genres of music postal service falls into (i guess it's electropop and sort of emo). i mainly listen to hip hop (del the funkee homosapien, madlib, atmosphere, latyrx, etc.) and very few groups/bands/artists of other genres. after a friend who was a huge fan recommended it to me, i went out and got the cd and really loved it (well the first 2/3 of it anyway...i usually pop another cd in after clark gable, the rest just got boring, hehe). just about every song up to and including clark gable sounds pretty good, except recycled air...that one bores me.<br />i'd recommend it to anyone hoping they'd give it a chance. the lyrics and the vocals just sound so good. the vocals and the synth beats also compliment each other so well.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|Let me start off by saying that this is much better than Songs in A- Minor.  It's good to see A.Keys growing so much after one album.  Although if you weren't a big fan you wouldn't know the difference between either albums, but there is much growth.  First her voice is noticeably stronger.  And this album is not as slow as the first.  I love the interludes I could listen to her play the piano for the entire cd.  I love KARMA its catchy and its nice to hear a diff sound from her.  HEARTBURN is my fave upbeat song on the cd.  It sounds like an old James Browne sample.  Very FUNKY!  The next song is a remake IF I WAS YOUR MAN/WALK ON BY I like it, but I feel that it falls flat towards the end.  But thats aight cuz the best song on the CD is next U DONT KNOW MY NAME! YES i saw the video 20x a day and heard the song 50x a day, but everytime I heard the song I became more obsessed with it.  It is one of the greatest beats I have ever heard.  KANYE IS A GENIUS! It is so old school, the vocals in the background are off da chain.  Sounds rite out the 60s.  The next jam IF I AINT GOT YOU, is a great smash too.  Actually 5-7 are the best songs on the cd.  The cd is worth these 3 songs.  Her voice is at its strongest here. And DIARY with Tony Toni Tone is destined to be a classic.  DRAGON DAYS comes and goes with me its a nice song nonetheless. The cd becomes a lot slower towards the end.  I still like it, but I really like SLOW DOWN.  But I really listen to music, to the average person it would be boring, but its still good music.  I would like to have heard another uptempo jam from her, but its great music, a great cd, and better than 95% of anything else out there now.  So how much can I really complain.  I love A. Keys!
0802130208|5.0|Twelve years after John Kennedy Toole committed suicide; he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for \\"A Confederacy of Dunces.\\" Toole was truly deserving of the prize for his hilarious and captivating story that follows Ignatius J. Reilly's interesting adventures (and misadventures) through New Orleans during the 1960s.<br />Ignatius J. Reilly is a thirty-year-old overweight man that lives with his mother in New Orleans. Ignatius is an interesting figure not only because of his stature, but because he enjoy wearing plaid shirts and a large green hunting cap. Because of the way he dresses, he draws much unneeded attention to himself, which gets him in trouble in more than one occasion. He retells all of his \\"traumatic\\" experiences to anyone absurd enough to lend him an ear. His favorite would be the time he rode along in a Greyhound bus that was traveling to fast for his liking.<br />Ignatius believes everyone has lost a \\"sense of decency\\" and are too caught up in the material world. He writes down his anger towards the regular dregs of society in his book \\"A Lengthy Indictment of Our Century.\\" Ignatius never strolls too far from his room where he creates his masterpiece, which leads his mother to demand him to get a job.  Ignatius however, believes he is unfit for conventional employment, which would be correct, but he finds a job anyways. <br />Toole exquisitely details Reilly's escapades as a workingman and is nothing short of hilarious. He first finds a job as a file clerk at Levy Pants, a clothing manufacturer. He befriends a elderly woman that has been working there many decades but has not retired because Mrs. Levy believes she would feel not welcome in society. Ignatius's stint at Levy Pants however was cut short when he tried to create an uprising for reforms. Shortly thereafter, he finds a job as a hot dog vendor. However when he his hot dog cart is stolen, he decides that, \\"The human desire for food and sex is relatively equal. If there are armed rapes, why should there not be armed hot dog thefts?\\"<br />Throughout this novel Ignatius meets many interesting characters. Mrs. Lee is a very strict and at times insane owner of the Night of Joy Bar; Police Officer Manusco, whose job was to find suspicious characters by dressing like one himself; Miss Trixie, the old lady who works at Levy Pants that tries to retire but is always stopped; and of course Myrna Minkoff, the closest thing Ignatius has had to a girlfriend. Each character at some point in the novel brings in comic relief.<br />A Confederacy of Dunces is a novel I believe everyone should read. It is a very humorous story in which Toole criticizes society through Ignatius. Toole however was incapable of taking his own characters advice: Boethius's rota fortunae. Wait long enough and the wheel of fortune will turn your way.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce may be a lil overexposed, but she is not overrated, she is the TRUTH.  I love her, her voice, her style.  And to all of you that do not believe she can sang with the best of them.  CRAZY IN LOVE leads of the cd and get it jammin.  Just when I was gettin tired of the song, I saw her perform it at the 2003 MTV VMA's and it became my fave again.  The dancin the arrangement, and the Chi-Lites sample makes it irresistible.  NAUGHTY GIRL is incredibly sexy.  I have to say I liked the song more after it became a single.  BABY BOY my favorite uptempo song on the cd, is just great.  It's bhangra sound just makes you wanna get up and move.  HIP HOP STAR is good, but its just a filler to me.  I don't skip over any of the songs on the cd, but if I did this would be the one despite guest appearances from Big Boi and Sleepy Brown).  BE WITH YOU is where the cd is getting good. Her voice and passion come out and grab you.  ME MYSELF AND I continue that trend, and this is where her vocals really shine.  BUT YES, SIGNS, and SPEECHLESS are the highpoints of the cd.  I LOVE YES! it is my fave on the entire cd.  The beat is intoxicating.  Signs is clever and features Missy, what more do you want?  Speechless ends this string of slow burners, but does it in grand style.  The last minute and a half of that song is classic.  She sounds great.  THATS HOW U LIKE IT is another bouncy track with Jigga.  I love the remake of THE CLOSER I GET TO YOU with the legendary Luther Vandross.  It is classic and their voices sound great together.  The next highlight is a GIFT FROM VIRGO a very sensual and laid back jam allows her voice to flow freely over the music.  The hidden track, DADDY, is nice, but forgettable.  I STILL JAM THIS CD! as if it came out last tuesday.  I love it and i love her and she is one of the best performers in the world.  She is sexy, talented, and gonna do what she wants!  She just has IT!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Ok, it is official. The new sound of alternative rock is to sound like punk/modern rock bands from the late 70's to the early/mid eighties. The Stills sound like Joy Division, and now Franz Ferdinand sounds like the Talking Heads. Even the video for &quot;Take Me Out&quot; screams Talking Heads. This is not bad because I grew up listening to this type of music, and I would rather listen to it even if it is recycled. These top 40 pop songs and boy bands of today are so annoying that to me listening to Ferdinand is a pure blessing.
B0000027RL|5.0|This album should not be considered under the great grundge albums, but under the great rock and roll albums of our time.  Pearl Jam is easily one of the greatest bands ever.  These songs sound great on a album and even better live.  If you dont have TEN, then your just SOL
B000069CWE|5.0|Whether you're a rap fan or a rock fan, you'll love this album. Rap fans are gonna love the songs with Kutmasta Kurt and Motion Man, Chali 2na of Jurassic 5, the X-ecutioners, and Zion, while rockers will love the songs with Jonathan Davis from Korn, Aaron Lewis from Staind, Stephen Richards of Taproot, and Jay Gordon of Orgy. If you're having a party any time soon, pop this CD in. You'll have a party no one will forget. :P
B00004TA41|5.0|This disc is 60 minutes of some of the most impassioned free jazz you will hear from an innovating giant in the field. Of the myriad posthumously released recordings of John Coltrane, _Interstellar Space_ is certainly one of the most profound.<br />Part of what makes the album intriguing is that the lineup is unlike anything else Coltrane did. Jazz duos became more common later. The entire album is improvised in duo format with Rasheid Ali on drums. Coltrane could have found no drummer more empathetic than Ali, who is a very different beast than the mighty Elvin Jones. Ali abandons the role of rhythmic anchor and follows Coltrane directly into the free vortex, and the two play against one another in a dazzling swirl of spattering cymbals, clattering rolls, tonally-straining honks and sqruawks, and spitfire runs of 16th notes. The sparse texture purifies the focus on the rich dynamics, intensity, and magical interplay. Meter exists in this music only by implication. The music is played around time signatures, but only rarely do they overtly appear. It's brutally passionate (&quot;Mars&quot;), shockingly beautiful and emotional, (the final third of &quot;Venus&quot;), and wickedly swingin' (for about 15 glorious seconds near the end of &quot;Saturn&quot;). And it's all dangerously jazzy and movingly spiritual.<br />If you want another masterpiece of monstrous duo free jazz, hunt down _Spots, Circles, and Fantasy_, Cecil Taylor on piano and Han Bennink on drums.
B000001IPL|5.0|I listen to this classic right now! Such an awesome album even after the years!
B0000C7PRY|4.0|I have followed the progession of the Spock's Beard trek since the second album was released. Aside from the vocal ensemble solos it was very hard to diferentiate between who was singing what. Buy the time the awesome &quot;Snow&quot; album came out (Neal's last SB ablum) and buying SB's drummer Nick (aka NDV) I realized the &quot;best voice&quot; sonically is the drummer, Nick's...and I was pleasantly surprised. Though I love Neal's vocals, SB's drummer simply sings better, and if one were to go back and listen to SB's &quot;Snow&quot; again they would find Nick (the drummer) sings lead on the most &quot;catchy&quot; cuts. Ala: Carie, Looking For Answers, etc. So as much I feared the &quot;change of the guard&quot; within Spock's Beard I must admit this is an awesome output by Neal, as is the same with SB's Feel Euphoria. Both albums are a solid 4 star effort and I feel quite confident that both camp's next outputs with each be 5 star outputs. Buy &quot;Snow, Feel Euphoria, &amp; Testimony.&quot; You will find all organic vintage sounds on all of these releases, whereas most other &quot;pseudo-prog&quot; acts simply sound like the &quot;Demo Song Button&quot; one would press on any keyboard you buy in a music store; what audio engineers refer to as &quot;test beds.&quot; <br />Neal Morse and any project he has been with that is solo, group, whether these projects are intact or defunct are all the real deal.
B000005ALN|4.0|the harsh review given by Roni Sarig was a hack job by obviously someone who knows nothing about the yes, ARTIST...George Michael.<BR>amazon...do a better job with your &quot;amazon.com reviewers&quot;...don't accept anything in crayon.
B00006J3WH|4.0|Well all I can say is that this was an amazing idea, adn it worked out splendidly. As mentioned before though, the actual visuals add alot, and they didn't leave in any dialogue which I think they should have. Well Sarah Michell, does not have a tremendous voice, it is very far from bad. SHe delivers her verses with good clarity and emotion. Amber Benson is definately the best singer in the cast, followed by Emma Caulfield and Tony Head. Jamnes Marsters is disapoinitng, since he is one of the 2 professional singers on the show. I def. recommend this, and I also recommend to buy the season 6 box set to get the full experience.
0385043805|4.0|This book boasts one of the perfect opening paragraphs, quite similar in &quot;instant classic&quot; feel to the 1st paragraph of The Haunting of Hill House. Manderly features as largely as any character, benign and malevolent, shelter and trap.  And in the end, I can't bear that it is no more.<br />I really feel that Maxim is awful and the narrator is a twit.  But neither weakens the story; they're just ideas of their time.
0156027321|5.0|I will not add anything to those hundreds of reviews. Just read the book and see by yourself. It is one of the best I ever read. The reviewer from Portland (re: Metaphorical Animals and Zoos vs the real thing) who wrote a review on May 20 2004 should read again Chapter 13 of the book, he will see that Hediger was well mentioned as a reference.
B000002UUX|5.0|There is not ONE metal album that can compare to this in terms of solo's, let alone the great symphonies of metal this album presents.  Marty Friedman has got to be one of the most under-rated lead guitarists ever.  Listen to the precision of his solos on Hangar 18, Lucretia, Tornado of Souls, and anything else he touches.  I don't know one other lead guitarist that could've pulled this album off so perfectly.  Some players wail and shred, some are really melodic, but I challenge anyone to find a guitarist who can combine these two as well as Marty (please let me know, cuz i want more like this).  The speed at which he's playing, mixed with real melodies, not just speed scales, is unbelievable. I can't say enough about his playing on the album.<BR> <BR>The album itself is just incredible.  I definitely think this album is the culmination of Megadeth, its highest point.  Theres fast riffs, as on Holy Wars, mixed with the solos, mixed with some really tight drumming - check Take No Prisoners - just leaves the listener blown away.  Though Countdown was a great album too, it strayed away from metal and went into mainstream in the same way as the Black album (though i love both these albums).  This album is uncompromising and pushes the boundaries of metal - not through obnoxious lyrics or screaming, but through pure skill and amazing music.  Once you really get into this album, you can listen to it over and over and over again, and find something new EVERY TIME.  Do yourself a favor and get this album, you won't regret it.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|&quot;Take me away&quot; is a rip off of &quot;Bring me to life&quot; by Evanescence!  Avril has trouble hitting the high notes on this song and also on My Happy Ending.  The lyrics throughout are childish.
B00009RDGA|5.0|What a great and fun movie!  Tatum O'Neal steals the show here; she definitely deserved the Oscar for her great portrayal of the way-too street smart for her age orphan (maybe) Addie Pray (Loggins).  Adults and kids can enjoy this together without much fear of the admittedly seedy subject matter -- con artistry, prostitution, racial exploitation, the corruption of youth, etc.  You can't help but root for Addie all the while knowing that Moses will never be a good father, role model or successful &quot;businessman.&quot;  <br />The black and white cinematography recalls classic Margaret Bourke-White Depression-era photos as well as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; but without the need for Prozac or counseling.  The soundtrack is comprised of Thirties pop radio standards that fit perfectly without calling too much attention to themselves.<br />Madeline Kahn is a scream as Miss Trixie Delight, John Hillerman excels in two roles:  a sheriff and his brother, a local bootleggar, and P.J. Johnson is great as Trixie's maid, Imogene.<br />I loved it when I first saw it as a 12-year-old.  I still love it now.  So will you.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Just a bunch of crappy pop songs that sound vaguely familiar....as in ripped off from somewhere else.
B00004YW6I|5.0|Stories was my introduction to PJ's work, and it's one of my  favourite records. Some of the tracks don't grab you and may seem slow, but they eventually grow on you. Either way, the tracks that do stand out at first listen are enough to make this album more than worthwile. I wouldn't describe A Place Called Home as &quot;catchy&quot;. I think this is one of the most beautiful songs to have been made in quite some time, and if you're reeled in right away, it has more to do with it's poignancy. <BR>I also think the word &quot;happy&quot; doesn't quite describe the album. Stories is more about taking urban decadence and making the best of it. In a way, PJ's music, as &quot;dark&quot; as it has alway been, oftentimes carries an element of fun. Try singing This Is Love while you shower. Isn't it a blast?
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril singing a bunch more crappy pop songs...whiny songs about hating her ex-boyfriends.  The songs are nowhere near as catchy as the ones on Let Go though.  Avril has done no growing or maturing as an artist.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|As an avid fan since way before the get go (four months before Let Go even hit stores), I've been keeping close tabs on Avril.  The first album came out, the hype started, and then Avril was blowing up all over the place.  Before you knew it, hypocritical music guru's were coming out to denounce Avril's supposed &quot;punkness&quot; (the same people who aligned themselves with the likes of Good Charlotte and Simple Plan), and began focusing more on the person than the musician.<br />With both albums, it's important to look at Avril the musician as opposed to Avril the girl.  Strip away the pretense and you have a freshmen album that was weak with a few promising points (Losing Grip and Unwanted being the biggest stand outs).<br />Under My Skin is a major improvement; not only because it depicts a more optimistic side to Avril, but it's shying away from the punk/pop roots more prevelant in the first album, and leaning more towards rock/pop.  And yes, there is a difference.  It's not as annoyingly in your face.  The album's biggest stand out is &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, the collaboration with Ben Moody.  It presents the closest thing you could get to potentially &quot;deep&quot; lyrics and is very reminecent of some of the songs on Michelle Branch's first album.  &quot;Take Me Away&quot; and &quot;Forgotton&quot; also feature great rock riffs and would be great as potential singles.<br />&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is, perhaps, one of the weakest songs on the album, which still goes to say a lot, as it's stronger than most of the songs on her first album.<br />Old fans will be surprised by a more mature and open Avril.  Potential new fans might find themselves grudgently falling for her similtaniously.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Slipknot got its fans because it was the musical equivalent of horror films. It was angry, powerful and relentless.<br />This is just music. There's a couple of songs that are alright, but nothing on the level of their first two CD's. <br />I'm not of the camp that thinks a band needs to &quot;grow&quot; on every album, or change their sound to show they've grown up. I liked Slipknot because they were different and actually had the anger in their songs and emotional impact in how they played. There's very little emotion in any of the songs on this CD, either anger in the heavy songs or sadness in the slow songs.<br />It's not an awful album, it's just not what I wanted when I bought it. I was excited when I heard it was coming out because there's nobody really like Slipknot, but it seems like all they tried to do with this CD was close that gap and be more like everybody else.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|thsi is a great cd. i think that this cd goes right with there other cd. it is a great cd. it is still metal like the first and second one and it is still metal. it people don't like slipknot then this a great cd to get to know then. duality is a great song and i think it sould be reconized of one of the great songs on the cd.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Yes, I admit there were a couple catchy tunes way back on her debut album. But every album, commercial, movie she has released since proves beyond any doubt that her early hits were merely a fluke.<br />When I heard \\"Toxic\\" on the radio my jaw nearly dropped. No matter how opportunistic record labels are, I never thought a monument to lack of talent this large would ever actually make it on the air. Even the other vapid acts on top 40 radio have at least a particle of talent, if even only of the lounge act/state fair amateur contest variety.  Britney is not even attempting to sing anymore, just this breathy wimper that's supposed to be sexy, I guess.<br />Get off the stage, Brit. The show is over.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot had to change it up a little bit. U can only milk a musical &quot;sound&quot;  for so long untill it sounds bad. They gave the fans a taste of fresh air and it tastes good. They still got it aggresive wise but the lyrics are a bit off of the usual slipknot topic. There more deep and musicaly they have reached a new peak of prefection. I love the album and they got balls for changing it up so GO BUY IT!!!!!!!! dont listen to anyone else!!!!!!
B00016POFE|3.0|10 stars for an excellent album as for this item...<BR>this dvd is interesting for the first 5 minutes then it just totally wears off. Why would I want the instruments in 5.1 when you see the band in Right and Left channels?  I guess these things are more for the tripsters or for just showing off your system. I have star wars for that... Id much rather listen to the original recording.  Plus my media room is huge so Im not big on having the music sound so spaced out.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Great movies... but GL screwed with the classics.<br />It's like reworking Lawrence of Arabia or Ben Hur<br />Shame on him
B00020HEG6|5.0|I won't lie, I am most definately a twenty-something Harry Potter fan. I have been a fan of the books for quite a few years now. I was planning on buying this soundtrack months before it came out. All that aside, I find this to be John William's best since Star Wars, if not better. The past two Star Wars films had beautiful music that really captured the movie's essence, but this captivates every single tiny emotion that the book is filled with. I have yet to see the movie, but I do have a sense of what music goes with what scene, and I am looking foward to seeing it on the screen. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban definately wouldn't be the same movie without this wonderful composer. If for nothing else, I would recommend this soundtrack for track 5 (A Window to the Past). If you enjoyed the first two films music, you will most definately enjoy this, but when I listened to this song, I thought to myself &quot;Finally, Lily and James have a theme&quot;. I could give rave reviews for this soundtrack for hours and hours. I'm not much of a musician, but I know when music should be appreciated, and I give a standing ovation to John Williams for a spectacular arrangement.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I like most of the songs on this cd, the only problem is they are stone sour songs not slipknot.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is the record that many people didn't think would happen. A year ago everyone thought they would be gone. Well with this record they proved that the band is still around and proving that they are better than ever. As a guitarist I am simply amazed by the musicaianship of this record. This album honestely has no filler songs each songs is unique and heavy. The opening song is incrediple even though Corey repeats the same lyrics a couple of times. I was most surprised with acoustic songs being included in here. Don't get me wrong the songs are really good and have a dark mood to them. If you like Bother then you like these songs. This album easily destroys there two past albums and shows that the band is maturing. This album will change slipknot forever just like the black album did for Metallica. Slipknot is back and stronger than ever.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|I am a big Avril fan..I mean, I LOVED &quot;Let Go&quot; so much, it was so much more different than what Britney and Christina were doing at that time. I especially liked &quot;I'm With You&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, &quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot; and &quot;Complicated&quot; from her first CD. Although Avril has faced a lot of criticism, about her songwriting, her 'poppy' image, I still love her. However, when I heard &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot; on MTV, I seriously thought I was mistaken, that song is totally boring, and can't be compared to &quot;Sk8ter boi&quot; at all. I have listened to a few of her songs online from &quot;Under My Skin&quot; and still haven't heard any thing that's as good as the first album. Have I just lost interest in her, or is her 2nd CD seriously not as good as the 1st one?
B0001KZM3O|4.0|THIS WAS THE LAST FLOYD ALBUM WITH WATERS AND DESPITE RECIEVING NEGATIVE REVIEWS FROM CRITICS THIS SOLD MORE THAN MOST CHEESY 80'S NEW WAVE POP BANDS DID AND THOUGH IT WAS NOT THEIR BEST IT STIIL PACKED A LOT OF PUNCH AND IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO PINK FLOYD FANS.
0920668372|1.0|i hate this book ... seriously, i do.  it's not about incest or whatever, it's about death ... it's telling a little kid: \\"hey, your mommy loves you a lot...and you love your mommy, right?  well, shes going to die, and youre going to experience it.\\"  is this something you want your kid thinking? \\"my mommy loves me ... but someday she will be dead.\\"  I read this as an adult and it left me feeling like crap, thinking about it still does.
B000002U8G|5.0|THIS ALBUM WAS ONE OF THE THEIR BEST ALONG WITH THE WALL,DARK SIDE OF THE MOON AND WISH YOU WERE HERE AND FEATURES EXCELLENT SONGS LIKE ST TROPEZ AND THE 23 MINUTE LONG EPIC ECHOES.BRILLIANT.ONE OF MY FAVOURITE FLOYD ALBUMS WHICH HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.A MUST HAVE.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Mr. Tarantino is a man who obviously loves movies.....LOVES movies.  All the better still, he loves good movies.  If other film directors loved movies as much as Tarantino we would have some good flicks out there, and a minimum of Michael Bays and Zack Snyders.  Tarantino sets out to make the kinds of films that he loves, but with his own personal twist.  Kill Bill is obviously a labor of love given Tarantino's passion for 70s kung fu flicks.  I love kung fu flicks too, not as much as Tarantino(though I do rival him in our love for horror flicks), but I know enough to get all of the homages in this film.  You have to go into this expecting a movie that's not 100% serious and has all of that 70s cinema corniness on purpose.  Lets face it, no major studio would have released this film if any other director had made it-this film is a little more violent, zany and bizarre for the average 2 Fast 2 Furious crowd.  It's a good thing Tarantino did do this or it would have just been an obscure cult hit.  Tarantino shows he can do action sequences quite well-he hasn't done much of that in the past.  The martial arts sequences are well done, not that Matrix-slo-mo crap.  Uma Thurman looks like she really knows her stuff, though I'm sure she really doesn't know martial arts.  I'm not a big Uma Thurman fan, but that takes a back seat when watching this film.  Similar to Alice In Wonderland, though she may be the main character, it's all the other characters along the way that are cool.  And what is Tarantino's obsession with Uma Thurman's feet?  First Pulp Fiction, now here.  Uma Thurman's got some nasty feet, folks!  I don't know why we need to have so many long closeups of them.  I can tell you I'm sure not gonna risk getting thrown out a window for massaging those feet.  The rest of the cast is great though.  Tarantino likes using actors he admires, not just casting Vin Diesel for a quick buck.  Usually he tends to revive an old career in the process.  Look at Travolta, Pam Grier and now, David Carradine.  Plus we get to see Daryl Hannah as a villian.  I've always liked her.  Some great cameos too by Gordon Liu and Sonny Chiba.  Basically, I'm recommending this film very highly coz you won't be seeing many like it.  Sure, the plot is no different than a cheap Seagal movie, but this film makes up for it with storytelling, style, gore and action.  So, as a favor to me, think twice before renting crud like XXX or Dorque.rier and now, David Carradine.  Plus we get to see Daryl Hannah as a villian.  I've always liked her.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|I've been a fan of the band for 5 years now ever since they came out. this album really cannot compare to their previous albums in terms of intensity. but there are some really heavy, fine moments on this album. the acoustic songs are great and  brilliant. some fans will say, &quot;acoustic songs? oh no, slipknot sold out!&quot; but just because they used acoustic guitars doesnt mean it's not heavy. in fact, acoustic can be heavy! it may not be as energetic but it can be painful and emotionally heavy at the same time. opeth does acoustic songs, and nobody said anything! my only complaint on this album is one acoustic song is good enough on a slipknot album... but three? it kinda gets boring after a while. the guitar solo's are amazing! ummm... kirk who?!?! the drums as always, are jaw-dropping, and the percussions are more noticeable. the bass is very smooth and the vocals are great... singing or screaming. there's little swearing, but i can live with that... no swearing doesnt mean it's not heavy. opeth doesnt use profanity as much, but aren't they heavy as hell?!? the production/mixing could've been better though... it shoudlve been like Iowa's boomy production. all in all this is a great album, it has it's moments... some people will like the path Slipknot took, some people won't... the band can't please everyone anyway. just like apples and oranges, y'know? but still definately a must have, brilliant album!<br />HIGHLIGHT SONGS: The Blister Exists, Duality, Opium For the People, Welcome, Pulse of the Maggots, Vermilion Pt. 2, Before I Forget
B00008J2DQ|5.0|A lot of people complain that this CD sounds just like Godsmack's previous two. I agree, it does follow the same format and feature the same heavy riffs, harsh vocals and booming bass, but I don't mind hearing it again. This is still a great record. I've seen Godsmack live twice and once on their DVD, and they put on a pretty damn good show. Their pretty good musicians, but in the future it'd be interesting to see some longer songs from them, instead of just the common 3 to 4 minute rockers. Anyway, here's my opinion on each track:<br />1. Straight Out of Line-5/5-This was the album's first single, and I didn't care for it much back last year when I first saw the video on MTV2, but it's grown on me. A heavy, hard-hitting rocker from beginning to end. Great lyrics. Should make the fans happy.<BR>2. Faceless-5/5-Another heavy one, very guitar-driven. Extremely aggressive. Once again, this should make the fans happy.<BR>3. Changes-5/5-It starts out loudly, like the last track, but has more melody in the riff, and I love the bass. There are quiet breaks here and there, but for the most part, it's a loud song.<BR>4. Make Me Believe-4/5-This is yet another heavy one, but it has a lot of melody. Once again, great bass in the opening riff. The drumming's awesome. The only part that this song lacks in is the lyrics. But still, it's a good song.<BR>5. I Stand Alone-4.5/5-As I'm sure you're aware of by now, this song was originally released on the &quot;Scorpion King&quot; soundtrack, which Sully produced. It's gotten kind of old, but I still find it to be a very powerful song. Great lyrics. One might even say it's inspirational. But this is probably one of their best when they play live.<BR>6. Re-Align-5/5-You'll probably expect this to be a general Godsmack heavy track for the first 40 seconds or so, but it starts kicking ass when the melodic part kicks in. After that, the whole track is changed for the better. One of my favorites on this album.<BR>7. I F*cking Hate You-3/5-As you can imagine, this is the album's heaviest. But it's really, really bland, and the lyrics are horrible (&quot;For everything you do / I'd like to swallow you / And every day I'm gonna blame you&quot;). This is definetly not the album's best, but you might think differently.<BR>8. Releasing the Demons-5/5-A great comeback from the last track. It's heavy for the most part, yes, but it's also very catchy. The verses are quiet, and I like the lyrics. One of the best on the album.<BR>9. Dead &amp; Broken-3/5-This is another track that doesn't really stand out for me. Generic music, lyrics and vocals. The band can do better than this.<BR>10. I Am-5/5-HERE WE GO. Great, catchy ass opening riff with great guitar, bass and drums part. A lot of this is quiet, but heavy, but it gets loud here and there. Great lyrics.<BR>11. The Awakening-No Rating-This is just a little intro to the next track. It has tribal beats and singing, that's about it.<BR>12. Serenity-4/5-The quietest track on the album...it's acoustic. I think they tried to pull off another &quot;Voodoo&quot; but this doesn't quite cut it. It can be boring, but it's not horrible. They could have made a better ending, though.<br />So there you go. As you can tell, I think this is, for the most part, a great album. If you like hard rock, or metal, or just like Godsmack, definetly get this, and if you get the chance, see them live. They're ten times better then.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|IGNORE THE PATHETIC HATERS, THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM AND EVERY ONE SHOULD LISTEN TO IT!  PAY ATTENTION TO THE MUSIC, NOT THE NAME ATTACHED TO IT.  IF YOU ACTUALLY GIVE IT A LISTEN, YOU'D REALIZE HOW HIGH QUALITY AND UNDERRATED THIS ALBUM IS.  FORM YOUR OWN OPINION, DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO PEOPLE WHO WASTE SO MUCH OF THEIR TIME ON SOMEONE THEY DESPISE!!
031286504X|5.0|My book is entitled &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, it is written by Richard Matheson. The thing that caught my eye about the book was that Richard Matheson inspired Stephen King to start writing, also the fact that the book was about vampires. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; is about every human on Earth turning into vampires except one man, Robert Neville. Robert is trying to keep himself alive while all these vampires are thirsty for his sweet fresh blood. Robert tries to find if the so called &quot;vampire&quot; is a virus or not, and tries to find a cure for them. Robert Neville is a hunter in the day and when night falls he traps himself in his room. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; is an excellent book, I recommend this book to everyone and anyone. It is an exciting book that keeps you reading and reading. Richard Matheson wrote the book in a way that I could picture everything that was going on. The dialogue was also believable. I could see people talking the way they did in the book. Remember the book is entitled &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, pick it up and read it you'll like it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love every song on this album and I can't stop listening to it!  This is by far the best pop record I've heard in a long time, and easily Britney's best.  I advise you to rush out and get it ASAP.  You'll be blown away!  Highlights are: Toxic of course, Breathe on me, Everytime, Touch of my hand, and Boom Boom.  Every song is great though, it's a must have and a bargain for what you get!
B00005CBTH|5.0|Well, this, in my opinion, must be JP's greatest LP. The awesome intro to the album with Hellion leading right into Electric Eye is dominating at first, but then you drive right into some equally massive tunes. After riding on the wind, a mediocre song, you are blown away by Bloodstone, with a super intro riff and a great chorus, thanks to rob, but that is just hte beginning. Chains is a great song, as is Pain and Pleasure, but then the cd climaxes with such great tunes as the MTV fav. You've Got Another Thing Comin, the title song screamin for vengeance, and then my favorite song on the album, the AC/DC reminiscent Devil's Child. Album version is simple but insanely &quot;riffalicious&quot; and awesome, and the live version lives up to the studio in every aspect.<br />   All in all, Screamin for Vengeance is the best non-compilation album... such great songs as were mentioned cannot be compared. Thank you.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is a prime example of what an artist can do after the restrictions of the first album are gone.  I know, I know, her punk image was made, and she doesn't write all songs by herself, (but who does in the music industry besides a few lucky ones?) but this type of music (rock compared to more pop) is much better suited for her.  Also, many of her &quot;pop&quot; fans will be upset, as present of a few reviews that don't like this album.  Rock on.
B00005QFE5|5.0|This is an incomparable film.  Many story tellers try to move their audience to reexamine what they thought they knew -- to leave them haunted and deeply touched.  Many attempts come off as rather silly and maudlin.  Not this film.  This film may touch you in a way you didn't think possible.<br />I urge everyone to not try to discover too much about the specifics of this story -- I recommend you simply watch and let the story unfold.  Don't be overly curious about the plot -- anyway, this film is not &quot;about&quot; the plot, it's about being human.<br />The plot of this film is not important in the same way a Rorshach ink blot is not important.  But, like the ink blot, this film will reveal something, possibly much, of what is inside the beholder.  This film is about something vital to the human experience, and that something is longing.<br />It's about a longing to reconnect with a purity of feeling and experience.  A longing for simplicity in life, and the kind of love between a man and a woman that fulfills in such a way that is all but forgotten in the modern world, but if the instinct is alive inside you, this film will touch what is dormant, and will awaken it.<br />Watching this film, you may have laid bare an essential quality of the human experience that before was likely untouched, and undiscovered.  To have this done is a deeply emotional experience; it is the meaning of the word &quot;epiphany.&quot;<br />All this is accomplished with simplicity, subtlety, and absolutely, magnificently beautiful filming.  The crisp autumn air of northern China, the turning leaves, and the almost exclusive use of the low, late afternoon sun, coupled with backlighting and side-lighting creates a visual masterpiece, and contributes greatly to the emotional masterpiece.<br />Watch this movie, and find out about yourself, if you dare.  Recommend it to your friends, especially your lover, and find out about them, if you dare.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|After viewing this film all my love for the second installment of the film went completely out the door.  The worst thing the distributors of this film could have done was end the second film with to &quot;be continued&quot;.  The third film is bad on so many levels.  The film is dismal losing all the glory of the first two films.  It loses sight of it's main characters and basically concludes with an ending that negated the whole story line of the initial films.  I left the theatre let down that the series I loved so much ended on such a horrible note.  I immediately sold back my copy of the second film as I guess (by looking at the ample supply of used Reloaded dvd's) many others did as well.  I'll keep the memories of the first film and forget the other two ever happened.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Strip away the glitzy MTV pop styling of her debut album and dive deep into her soul.  You will find this CD under her skin.  It's edgy.  It's hard.  She writes about her own experiences in her young life.  And she didn't hide a thing.  Life is hard.  Relationships are hard.  She knows it.  She tells it.  Now you will too.  Give it a listen!
B000063DGC|5.0|This is a great recording.  Ozzy's voice sounds good and obviously, Randy Rhoades is excellent on this.  The renditions of the songs are top notch and the band is tight.<br />I Don't Know-5/5-excellent by any standard.  There was real fire in this song, but the live recording topped the studio recording.<br />Crazy Train-5/5 Another piece of excellence with some great improvization by Randy.  Just missing the &quot;ALL ABOARD!!!&quot; from the studio version.<br />Believer-5/5 This is the version of the song I know.  It sounds great, I love it.  Especially the intro guitar is excellent and it has a dark undercurrent to it.<br />Mr. Crowley-5/5-Great rendition of the Blizzard classic.  Played with a little more fire than the studio version.<br />Flying High Again-5/5-This is such a fun song.  In the studio or live.  It makes me want to go completely nuts.  <br />Revelation (Mother Earth)-5/5-This is a great song.  I think it is about the environment and how we need to treat earth with more respect.  It starts out slow and contemplative, then speeds up at the end.<br />Steal Away (The Night)-5/5-Another great song that continues from the previous track.  A fun and fast-paced track that leaves you reeling and this rendition has a drum solo to boot.<br />Suicide Solution-5/5-This is where Randy shines on the disc.  The song is good, especially live. Randy's guitar solo is remeniscient of Eddie Van Halen's Eruption but is a little better.  <br />Iron Man-2/5-I looove this song.  But I felt cheated because it was so short and not played in its entirety.  Not that what of it was played was not good.  My only real complaint about this album.  This is a Sabbath Classic<br />Children of the Grave-5/5-This is a great rendition of a Sabbath classic.  It really shows Randy Rhoads ability to interpret Tony Iommi's playing in his own way and he helps to make this song his (and Ozzy's) own.<br />Paranoid-5/5-This does get a lot of hype but it is another well done Sabbath classic. The solo that Randy did in the middle of the song was excellent.<br />Goodbye to Romance-5/5-A good breather after all of the loud and fast rocking.  This was a great rendition.  Randy shined in the guitar solo here.<br />No Bone Movies-4/5-Decent song but not quite as good as the others.  It was a really good rocking track though.<br />Dee (studio outtakes)-5/5-This was a guy and his guitar.  Randy in the process of creating a nice melody about his mother Deloris.<br />To sum it up.  This is a great buy.  It shows Ozzy and Randy at their best and the work of a guitar talent, much like Robert Johnson, Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan, that was gone way too soon.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril has gotten down to the basics.  Her basics.  The lyrics are hard and real. The music is guitar-driven rock.  She's in great form here.
B0000033IS|5.0|I don't really know how to put this amazing classic into aspect,all I can say is it is amazing,and I'm actually kind of sure that's all that needs to be said.Aretha's voice,the catchy songs,the meaningful tracks,and,most importantly,the soul.This album is just breathtaking,the most breathtaking tracks being the singles,which is almost every single track on the album.This album contains classics such as the mega-hit &quot;Respect&quot;,the vocal-filled title track,&quot;Do Right Woman,Do Right Man&quot;...and everything else,for that matter.I don't have a verdict for this album,but I clearly don't need one.Just buy it while you are still alive!
B000026FOA|5.0|Yes, I confess, like a lot of people I came to Nick Drake's music because of that car commercial.  And, despite my aversion to \\"greatest hits\\" packages, the first disk I bought was \\"Way to Blue.\\"  I don't have any excuse for buying a \\"best of,\\" aside from monetary restrictions, but I don't feel bad for being sold an album because of a Volkswagon ad -- Carlos Santana once said it doesn't matter how you get the music as long as you *get* it, and he's a guy who openly admits to first really hearing John Coltrane's music in a Jeep commercial. <br />I eventually did get the music.  As I listened to \\"Way to Blue,\\" though, I discovered that the songs I liked the most, \\"River Man\\" and \\"Cello Song\\" and \\"Way to Blue\\" all came from the same album: \\"Five Leaves Left.\\"  I finally went out and got it and I'm stunned at how much atmosphere, how much tone, how much sensation Drake achieves with so little.  <br />\\"Five Leaves Left\\" is a flat-out amazing record.  It sounds like the nostalgized memories of a passionate romance after a bitter break-up -- and I mean that in the best way.  \\"River Man\\" is a song that never fails to beautifully cause my spirits to sag; likewise \\"Saturday Sun\\" consistently brings them right back up again.  A sad and beautiful bunch of music.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I reviewed this album earlier and the more I listen it has parts that I like and then parts that I hate and am embarassed for them. What is this pretty singing crap about love and stuff, how can you go from &quot;if your 555 I'm 666&quot; to your more than I ever wanted love song crap. I think they forgot they are wearing scary masks.I may just burn it and then trade it in on something better,hell there are christian metal bands that are harder than this, try Soul Embraced. They used to be SIC now I think I am sick of them. Biggest disappointment since Damageplan. What is wrong with all these used to be thrashers. this has to be a joke. I hope they read these reviews and wake the f**k up.
B0001FR3IQ|2.0|A seemingly ordinary psychiatrist finds herself locked up in her own mental institution for a murder she can't remember, and with a ghost that won't leave her alone. The background music creeps and skulks and spasms, as the camera undulates, but the content is scattershot and laughably melodramatic. Add to that a doozy screenplay that skips between the natural and supernatural with such wild abandon that you never quite know where you are. If the director had been less interested in getting Berry out of her baggy hospital costumes, perhaps we could have savored a thriller with some coherence.
B000062YAZ|1.0|What can I say? This crap is horrible. It's just a bunch of screaming around but because they play instruments people call it music. I could start my own death metal band. All I would have to do is turn on a lawnmower and scream and moan into a microphone, pay someone to bang on a trashcan, then record it and sell it to mindless losers.
0618526412|4.0|Some books take a certain station in life to be savored fully, and McCullers' epic has got to be one of the most depressing coming-of-age novels I have ever read.<br />Unsurprisingly, it had bored me to death as I trudged through it in my teen years. But when I re-read the book now, it touches my heart and soul.<br />The book's southern American characters lead simple, seemingly joyless lives. Their hopes and ambitions are stymied by circumstances and human foibles, mostly of their own making. It is a very laid back novel, despite occasional spurts of violence.<br />But it is McCullers' fluent prose that makes this book absolutely worth the ride, as does the wide sweep of thoughts and emotions covered in the book --- our struggle against isolation, religion as self-delusion, valorm, our search for connection and redemption, society's repression of the individual.<br />It is not the most cheerful of novels, but will definitely strike a clangy chord with people who enjoy solitude but also know its pitfalls.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|My expectations were very high for this album, but it is clearly a step below her first. There is only one potential hit on this CD (&quot;My Happy Ending&quot;). The production is good, but the catchy tunes she is known for are missing. The juvenile lyrics, while excusable on her first album, are still present here, and the profanity is unprofessional.
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is the best Harry Potter soundtrack! Its full of action and adventure. I think you can see that Star Wars Episode III (in theater May 19th, 2005) and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (in theaters Novenber 19th, 2005) sountracks are going to be really good.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|OMG, i thought i just purchased stone sour for a minute there... i expected harder stuff than this.  Hell, disturbed had its moments in comparison to this (&amp; thats not saying much)... <br />I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I bought this cd and I must say, it is beyond belief. Slipknot have changed their sound quiet dramatically, but in a much more beautiful and darker way. There is alot of emotional lyrics on this release, and the music is much more varied and sounds like death metal one second, (check out three nil), then industrialized rock (title track, amongst others, all songs have some industrial sound or sample to them), to just plain heavy metal. The acoustic songs are great too. My only complaint is that the songs just get cut off, and then the next one goes on. i find that distracting, i prefer when songs just flow one into the other(check out god forbids gone forever, amazing cd as well), or the song fades out, instead of just stopping, but i guess thats what they wanted.<BR>     Overall, this is an amazingly powerful cd and definately one of the best releases so far this year. Highly recommended to fans of any kind of metal who have an open mind.
0141439513|5.0|This is an amazing book; when I read it I just can't seem to put it down. This edition which is published by \\"Penguin Classics\\" proves to be a wonderful read because of the information included in the back.<br />Ms. Jane Austen does an impeccable job of describing the characters in the story. Each one has their own distinct personality which is part of what makes this book such a classic. Mrs. Bennet is especially cute, the way that she is always talking about the fact that she'd like her daughters to marry, and seems to think that it would prove to be the pinnacle of her life if one of them married into wealth. When Mr. Collins comes into the picture and decides to marry Charlotte, he can't stop praising the house in which will one day be his.<br />This is where the book really picks up. At the conclusion of volume one, an individual is left only to imagine what could possibly be happening with Mr. Bingley and his beloved Jane.<br />In this charming love story, two people learn to \\"get over themselves\\" and develop feelings for one another.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|In regards to everyone's extremely harsh and farfetched comments about her follow-up album not living up to her first, I dont think you truly understand what it takes to be a real musician. This girl is far from what you could consider a pop-star. She does her own make-up for goodness sakes...and she doesnt lip-sync her concerts. Just because there isn't a &quot;sk8er boi&quot; track on the album, you are so quick to say that it sucks. Sk8er boi was the worst track on &quot;Let Go&quot; by far. If you take a second to actually read the lyrics of the songs (which she wrote) and listen to the music (which she also wrote) then you might actually see what good music is instead of this pop-princess Britney Spears crap. Thank god for Avril Lavigne, maybe all these other &quot;pop-stars&quot; will go away and music will be what it once was. Buy this album!
0517548232|5.0|This work is a solid value for the price charged. It integrates some common sense Economics principles with classics by Adam Smith and others. The author starts by explaining how public works projects benefit the local economy in the short term while paying for themselves over the long term in terms of toll revenues and additional taxes . He believes that high taxes tend to discourage badly needed investment. Machinery does displace workers in the short term; however, the incremental productivity<br />has a permanent benefit. What would we do today without cars?<br />or planes?<br />Tariffs tend to benefit producers at the expense of consumers.<br />Prices are determined by the dynamics of demand and supply.<br />Rent control has benefits but the downside tends to discourage new building. Unions tend to provide for local employment while at the same time providing pay equity and benefits for the<br />membership.<br />This book is a solid value for economists, households, students of economics , journalists and a whole host of constituencies.
B0001Z36PK|4.0|I find it strange that &quot;Absent Friends&quot; is heralded by various editorial sources as being a &quot;return to form.&quot; More properly, it's a return to a stylistic base (I'm one of those people who believes that Regeneration was a fun variation on a common theme). But oh how good it is! Those who're hankerin' for a return to the chamber-pop indies days of the Divine Comedy will love this release...as should, well, everyone else, ideally.<br />&quot;Charmed Life&quot; sets the tone; from its piano intro, it's immediately evident that the &quot;old&quot; Divine Comedy vibe is back. Refreshingly, Hannon has learned from his &quot;Regeneration&quot; experiment, and manages to meld his older style with that newer approach on some tracks. &quot;Leaving Today&quot; combines &quot;Regeneration&quot;'s moodiness and atmospheric approach with a lush, dramatic string arrangement. &quot;Wreck of the Beautiful&quot; continues in this tradition. Essentially, the tone retains the old Divine Comedy playfullness, but isn't afraid to indulge in introspection.<br />The more characteristically Hannon moments are also delightful. I absolutely adore &quot;Come Home Billy Bird,&quot; which features some of the most entertaining lyrics on the album (I've seen reviews that critique it as being &quot;formulaic.&quot; Ehh. If it's by numbers, it's at least done very, very well). And I have a soft spot for &quot;The Happy Goth,&quot; a song I saw Mr. Hannon play while he was opening for Ben Folds in New York a few years ago (my formative DC experience, natch).<br />Cons? The album seems to drag somewhat near the end, and there is a distinct lack of uptempo numbers (&quot;Billy Bird&quot;) excepted. &quot;Laika's Theme&quot; is pretty, but doesn't really go anywhere.<br />Verdict? A worthy entry in the Divine Comedy canon; to experienced fans it could conceivably either sound like more of the same or a welcome return to normalcy, but I'll stand confident in my statement that I just *really, really like* the thing. &quot;Absent Friends&quot; is FINALLY available domestically in the US. If you've never heard the band before, this is a great place to dive in.
B000000OPZ|4.0|Can vintage pop metal from the 1980s be taken seriously by adults?  Sometimes, yes.  Case in point: Whitesnake's eponymous 1987 album, which catapulted them to international success and made them one of the top bands of the late eighties.<br />This album is the result of the songwriting collaboration between singer David Coverdale and guitarist John Sykes, and it has everything one could ask of good pop music: melody, wit, energy, and immaculate production.  Coverdale is in very fine voice, and Sykes' guitar playing--well, it simply must be heard to be believed.  This man is a virtuoso's virtuoso; his fingerwork alone is worth most guitarists' tapping.  One scintillating solo follows another, but the fireworks are always in the service of the songwriting, which is largely first-rate.<br />Unfortunately, David Coverdale's personality is not one that cultivates collaborative bliss.  By the time this album was released, Sykes had been fired and the Whitesnake lineup was completely transformed.  Indeed, the big hit off this album, &quot;Here I Go Again,&quot; was a recycled 'Snake song from the 1982, and featured a solo from Sykes' replacement, Dutch guitarist Adrian Vandenberg (and a fine solo it is).  That said, this is still very much Sykes' album, and an enormous accomplishment at that.<br />Who knows what heights Whitesnake would have reached had Sykes stayed and continued to write with Coverdale.  The band's follow-up, &quot;Slip of the Tongue&quot; (1990), was relatively lackluster, despite some good tracks, and they never again reached the level of this album.  Oh, well--at least this still makes good listening.  Even for people who are now older and wiser.
B000002JK2|5.0|Having bought this on vinyl when it first came out, I awaited the CD release which has rarely left my playlist in the last decade-and-a-half.  This is an album that defies pigeon-holing and it's highpoints overshadow its flaws (and there are several) by a high exponential factor.  This is one of the saddest and most joyous recordings I've ever heard.  Sad because it marked Ronnie Lane's diagnosis with MS and joyous because it souded like a bunch of guys just happy to play music together.  The hits outrank the stiffs by a large margin as well.  &quot;Street in the City&quot; threatens to be an other self-indulgent Townshend epic, but the sweetness of his singing and the wistful feel redeem its flaws.  Nearly every Lane track is flawless and the arrangements are great, bringing in banjos, mandolins and harmonicas, where needed,to give it a timeless sound.  Just writing about the record makes me smile.
0738203335|4.0|The book gives a complete history of open source development starting from the earlier days of RMS and Linus. The strong point of the book is that the depth of coverage on open source history is unmatchable.  My most favourite chapters are the ones that describe the early development of Linux and the history of Perl. <br />Reading the book gives the impression that author's bias against the RMS-style free-software. Also the author gives enough hints of his dislike for Microsoft's style of proprietary software. And towards the end, as the author starts explaining linux' entry into the corporate place, the book tends to be a bit dragging.<br />Overall, a must read for any open source enthusiast.
0064431789|5.0|I read this book many times when i was little. I don't read it much anymore (18 years old now).But i still keep it on my bookshelf. Whenever i happen to pass over it on my shelf it makes me smile. I have always had a great imagination. When i read this book as a child it took me right into the story. I am a great lover of books today And would not be surprised if books like &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; had something to do with it! I would recommend this for any kid!
B000089RVR|4.0|Her lyrics prove once again looks are deceiving, she is no angel...  My fave track is &quot;White Flag&quot;...  Her and Sarah McLachlan are two peas in a pod so to speak who have made it somewhat successfully in alternative music listening crowds as well as mainstream...  I believe it's because they both have talent, and are putting out music they believe in... If you enjoyed &quot;No Angel&quot; you'll enjoy this one as much if not more - so go out and buy it - Savannah Skye...
B0001NBMBC|5.0|All I gotta say is what a change slipknot has had.  I kinda liked their first album because it was really different.  9 people doing their own thing.  Their second cd Iowa was like a rehash of the first album filled with sick lyrics and full of swearing.  I liked a couple songs off of it.<BR>This cd after 3 + years is so incredible.  I never thought I would say that about slipknot.  Just to note there is no Swearing and no sticker, that's a shock to start out.  The first song is prelude 3.0 it's basically an intro, instrumental with some lyrics thrown in.  It sounds like a funk rock and roll blend.  The blister Exists, when it starts you would think here we go again.  It's a heavy song, they seem to want to go back to the rap screaming they did in the first 2.  But all of a sudden you hear lots of singing ala stone sour.  Three Nil is another heavy songs, but this is way different.  Theres layers of screaming and regular singing.  Theres also a huge drum solo, it sounds like all 9 are drumming different stuff notes  <BR>Duality, which is the first single.  Starts out with a piano and Corey sings, Theres a nice change between the music.  Good chorus in the song.  Opium of the people starts with a kick ass guitar solo one of many.  More of a rap song with fast singing, again lots of changes between songs, again a great chorus the likes of stone sour.  6 circle is where the craziness begins.  The song starts out like someone is pressing keys on a computer, and some weird sounds.  Then the song turns into GASP acoustic?  The entire song is playing toned down guitars and Corey singing is low as he can, violins ect.  The lyrics are great, at the end it starts with the weird sounds again.  Then funky, DJ thing starts with drumming 7. Welcome is a heavy song with a weird background music piece. Vermilion starts out as a heavy song, but it goes down.  Singing is through the song, mixed with guitars.  A twisted carnival thing going on at the end.  Great lyrics, and a chorus that seems like a lot of people are singing.  It's a song about someone you love that you can't have.  Unlike before it doesn't involve killing them.  Pulse of the maggots, starts out with an end of the world sounding siren.  Corey is chanting the world is ending type stuff and you hear marching.  The song is like a thank you to their fans (maggots).  It's a heavy song, with a lot of sound efforts and almost trancing lyrics it seems like.  Before I forget, is a stone sour type song.  Not really heavy, but not soft.  Great lyrics, and towards the end a kick ass musical piece with great singing.  vermilation pt 2 is a continuing theme and lyrics to the first Vermilation.  With the same button pressing and DJ scratches.  Then in the mist of it, the whole song changes and goes to acoustics again.  Even slower then the last time, a very slow song.  It seems to be a reverse to the heavier first part.  Great lyrics and once again ends great.  People who think Corey can't sing should listen to this.  The nameless is what I call the diseased song.  It starts out insane, then in the middle it goes to acoustic for the chorus.  It keeps changing like that.  It sounds really odd, the changing.  A very different song indeed.  The virus of life is easy the old slipknot.  But again with a twist, very crazy music but through the whole song he is whispering.  Singing as ruff as he can in an almost growl.  The chorus is where it picks up.  Hard to make out what he is saying.  The darkest lyrics and lots of screaming.  <BR>The last track Danger keep away, starts out like the first song but like the ending.  Great music, some lyrics.  Good ending<BR>I never really liked slipknot a whole lot, but after I read all the good reviews and the changed sound of them.  They actually used the 9 people to make something worth listening to.  Lots of people and calling them slip sour, because it kinda sounds like stone sour.  But there are still some crazy songs.  They just used the time to make different songs.  I love the cd, 3 Acoustic songs, pianos, keyboards, orchestra stuff, and so much more. People seem to forget Corey was in stone sour first and slipknots real first album was way more experimental.  No reason to call it stone sour, it still sounds like slipknot.  Listen to it a few times it is great.  Also you get alot of extras from slipknots site with the cd for 9 weeks.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I love this cd! You can relate to what Avril says in her songs, and the beat is cool as well. It's heavier then Let Go but just as good!
B0000C7GG2|5.0|It's nice to see MUSE popularity grow each year. I first saw the band in a club in Stockholm with a capacity of 500, however the last time okt/2003 the audience increased to about <BR>2500 people, 500%. And if MUSE continiues to release albums like this one i'm sure the capasity of the next show gonna increase with another 500%, aka 12500 people on their next one.<br />Apocalypse please is as pompus as a song ever could become with as one of you put it a &quot;Mozart on speed&quot; feeling to it.        Sing for absolution, and most of the albums songs are representing MUSE at their best. If the band ever would do a greatest collection a lot of the songs would come from this one.<BR>And for all of you that really love MUSE music please check Jeff Buckley out (Grace) , one of MUSE strongest influences...he's the source and soul of the 90's, and much missed since he drowned in 1997. Guess what the last track on their Stockholm show-setlist was... Intence is the word!
6304779356|3.0|I don't think I was old enough to remember this film hitting cinemas, but I discovered it before I got too cynical and still have a deep affection for it.  It combines horror, forbidden romance, comedy, and touches on issues of peer pressure, loss, divorce and the importance of sticking by your family (even if your brother is a vampire).<BR>A mother (Dianne Wiest) and her two sons (Corey Haim and Jason Patric) move from Arizona to sunny Santa Carla and in with their formulaic \\"crazy granpa\\" (you know the type I'm talking about) as a result of divorce.  The eldest son Michael (Patric) quickly falls in with the Wrong Crowd by accidentally moving in on Head Honcho's girl (the lovely Jami Gertz).  Things take a turn for the worse when Michael discovers these aren't your average bike punks, but a gang of wild vampires. Indeed.  It's all up to bratty little bro Sam (Haim) and his new allies the Frog Brothers to save the day, and stop his mother from getting too cosy with a new guy who doesn't just run an appliance store (a nice performance from Edward Herrmann who seems to pop up everywhere).<BR>Kiefer Sutherland is a treat as David, leader of the biker vamps, I still marvel at how he can make a peroxide mullet look cool.  He plays this role as a sort of seductive bully very well.<BR>Corey Feldman (because 1 Corey is never enough) also puts in a nice turn as Edgar Frog, plus you'll spot Alexander Winter of Bill & Ted's fame as one of the gang.<BR>It's better than any recent vampire movie, has a great 80's soundtrack (Cry Little Sister, you know you love it) and a greasy saxophone man in purple pants.  It's fun, there are a couple of scares and a nice hint of splatter (the Surf Nazi attack is like something out of Peter Jackson's Bad Taste).  I give the bare-bones DVD package 3, but the movie 4.  And fear not, there will be a special edition very soon with retrospectives, making of and tons more stuff, keep eyes peeled!
1577311523|1.0|When the love and hate disappear, maybe I'll understand it. Beware of this book people. Tolle didn't &quot;become enlightened&quot; by following his own method. His methods, if followed seriously, may, nay, probably will, drive you insane.
B0000025ZF|4.0|I have always wondered why people keep comparing different albums and try to have a point of reference.  Bottom line is if you enjoy Waters/Pink Floyd, this is a must-have album.  Clapton guitar adds a different dimension to Waters work.  It is as if you can trace the blues roots in the psychedelic genre.  Sanborn mixes the jazz element and Waters voice is as solid as always.  In fact his voice is just imperfectly perfect.  Now adding the late Michael Kamen and the National Philarmonic Orchestra and you really can't go wrong.<BR>Great songs are plenty. The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking, Every Strangers Eyes, Go Fishing and ...<BR>And finally the lyrics are strong as always.  What else is there to a great album?
B0000070QS|5.0|When I buy a CD, its usually for only one or two songs. I can say with conviction that I love EVERY song on this album. That is a rare thing. Songs like Spanish Steps and Los Angeles are the real jewels of this amazing CD.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Slipknots new Cd is awsome I think its better then the Iwoa Cd. Even thow this cd has some slow songs it still rocks and so do those songs thats all I got to say
B00000IBRI|2.0|Occasionally I watch a gross-out horror movie, if I like the actor and it has high reviews. I tend to forget that the high reviews always come from horror fans.<br />And I have yet to see such a movie that was really good by ordinary film standards. This is no exception. Basically the story and logic is sacrificed for cheap horror effects, like maggot-eaten faces.<br />The one good thing about it is Jennifer Connelly, who even at this tender age was the prettiest thing on two legs.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I loved her vocals on &quot;Let Go&quot;, amid the negative hype that sometimes would come up.  This album is similar, but with some maturity heard in alot of the songs.  Alot of the album has &quot;hit&quot; material, such as &quot;Take me away&quot;, &quot;Together&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, and most of the rest.  The lyrics are catchy, as they were in her first album.  The song themes are of more adult situations than the first, and the lyrics have improved, although they were good in Let Go, also.  A highly recommended album.
B0001ENYKS|5.0|the album's great. i'm not much of a student of music history, just a lil' undeserving fan, so i'll spare you a pitiful dissection of said album. 'sides, i ain't getting paid for this sh*t anyways.<br />got me a bone to pick with a certain DIRK VOETBERG tho(april 25 review) here are a few gems off of this genious' review:<br />\\"He also sings in a similar theme and tone to that of Joy Division (before they inexplicably dismissed Ian Curtis from the band to create New Order)\\" - wtf?!?! dear dirk, ian curtis' departure from the band was just a bit more dramatic and unexpected than you describe here. but what the hell can i expect from someone who insists on referring to the band in the singular. \\"but franz ferdinand is the name of a person and it don't have no S at the end!!\\" yes i know dirk, however uh..nevermind..<br />\\"Franz does and he completely decimates the Beatles with his superior facility for hooks and complexity.\\" oh wow, this dirk is really starting to tick me off now. HOW DARE you use a word like \\"facility\\" which i had to look up in my dictionary? but seriously, \\"franz decimates the beatles\\" with this one album???<BR>thank god insanity cannot be transmitted via comp. screens. <br />and here i'm probably echoing everyone's sentiment by saying thank you. thank you for finally shedding light on the meaning of the mysterious acronym \\"C.D.\\" who knew it stood for COMPACT DISC!!!! DIRK, your intelligence is such that my brain is straining against the walls of my skull trying to escape the reality of the here and now and enter the sublime universe that is your infinite faculty. and i'd like to call this new state of nirvana THE VOETBERG ZONE!!!  <br />c'mon everybody, let's all climb aboard dirk's magic carpet and fly away to THE VOETBERG ZONE!! listening to franz ferdinand's C.D. (Compact Disc, for you slow learners)  weeee!!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Rick Rubin has brought out the best of everyone in the band and to all the people who are jumping ship because they changed some stuff you should be ashamed to call yourselves Maggots. Being a maggot means loyalty and trust trust what they do and be loyal to them
B00001OH7V|3.0|As much as this is a David Bowie album, this is also a Brian Eno album (as well as a Robert Fripp collaberation). Two hits made it to the airwaves in 1977... \\"Beauty & The Beast\\" and the title track \\"Heroes\\". The 3rd track \\"Heroes\\" is worth the price of the CD alone. With that being said, I find myself sitting on the fence when I listen to this disc in it's entirety. The feel of the album is new wave and electronica, lots of bass and some funk... almost like it was ahead of its time and should have been from the early 1980's. Eerie sounds and too many instrumentals to be a typical Bowie album (4 songs in all are without Bowie's voice). Having listened to these tracks enough over the past few decades, I now find myself usually fast-forwarding over these instrumentals (\\"V-2 Schneider\\", \\"Sense Of Doubt\\", \\"Moss Garden\\", \\"Neukoln\\"). \\"Heroes\\" is dark and moody - hence you gotta be in THE mood to listen to it. Bowie has so many excellent cd's in his catalog... I find myself reaching for others first - like \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", \\"Aladdin Sane\\", \\"Diamond Dogs\\", \\"Young Americans\\", \\"Station To Station\\", \\"Scary Monsters\\", or even \\"Let's Dance\\". This is good Bowie... better yet, a unique and different side of Bowie... but, it is far from my favorite Bowie.
B000005YZM|5.0|One of my favorite albums, ever.
B000002TPS|4.0|Well I can't say I'm the biggest fan of Megadeth.  However I do enjoy there works, but Youthanasia is definitly one of the best they've done. Musically enlightning and lyrically inspiring, some of the best soloing I've ever heard. Dave and Marty have done homework in this one.  Still my only quarrel with the album is the track Victory, where Dave incorperates song and album titles into the lyrics aka., Manowar in the album Kings of Metal the song Blood of the Kings in 1988. Thats the only reason I give it 4 stars, sorry Dave been done before. Still if your a fan and it is definatly worth getting
B00005A46T|5.0|This is the best Slipknot album yet.<br />1. (515) - I refuse to listen to this cuz I listened to it at night. Scary. Still good. 4/5<BR>2.

B00002MZ2T|5.0|On their second and most recent album,Savage Garden bring more hits like THE ANIMAL SONG,CRASH AND BURN and the adult contemporary I KNEW I LOVED YOU. HOLD ME has the sound of Hanson. It's as if Hanson recorded the song. TWO BEDS AND A COFFEE MACHINE is a touching story tune. The title track and GUNNING DOWN ROMANCE sound awesome. All the other songs are cool. After this album,Darren Hayes recorded a solo album,SPIN. It was released in the spring of 2002.
1400032717|1.0|It is sign of how low standards have sunk when this book has received so much praise. I am so frustrated that the author felt that it was necessary to liberally use so much obscene language in this book (no doubt in the  cause of realism - but we all don't live our lives surrounded by people swearing). It's a disgrace that this book wins a children's fiction award. My daughter and I couldn't get through it. This book should have come with a warning for parents.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|this album really made me see my &quot;life&quot; in music in different way.i'm surprised when the acoustic mood song played by a brutal band.GOOD.you doesn't have to shout to express your feeling.it's really worthy when i bought this album.go get it in stores.open your mind when listening to this album.music must be dynamic.
B00004Z459|1.0|LinkinPark is the worst excuse for a band in history, they are just as bad as ICP. I cannot believe that I have to give them at least one star on this site, because they really do not deserve it. I really cannot believe that I paid money for this garbage. This whole intergration of rap, pop, and rock is BS! All those people that listen to LinkinPark do not know what REAL rock is. Because of LinkinPark there should be a negative star rating on this site. Burn in musical hell LinkinPark!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this album. When I heard Duality then Pulse of the maggots; I was siked like no other. After hearing this album, I wasn't in complete awestruck, but rather fullfilled with a new profound respect for the 'knot. They have proved that they can do more than scream the loudest and play the fastest that they can, but rather show that they can play their instruments well and show that they can write really soild songs. Corey writes some powerful lyrics and does it without having to say f**k all of the time. Granted it's nice to get fustration out and yell and cuss, but I wouldn't want to get this album if it sounded like S/T and Iwoa, when you could just listen to them over and over again and save the money. But there are hints of styles from the two major label albums. As for production wise, Rubin has never dissapointed. Some real cool effects with corey's volcals (ie. echo in circle; foreground and background mixture in the nameless). There is not one bad song on this album, and those who are not narrowed minded, it's a must. As for those say that they have &quot;sold-out&quot; for the money, it's a little to late. Iowa was a platinum selling album and actually would allow a band to either repeat the exact album(formula) and try to get platinum again, or put out what they want without the pressure of trying to make the big bucks. If you want a band that stays to the simular formula and is brutal, then I would suggest some Cannibal Corpse. The Wreatched Spawn is a seriously sweet album and is another must. And don't say this is not slipknot, this is stone sour, the last time I checked, the cover sleeve said Slipknot.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Ok, don't get me wrong, I love acoustic music, but I never in a million years expected not one but two acoustic tracks on a slipknot record. It just ruins everything. Slipknot was supposed to be about brutality... music to work out to, to play basketball, something physical. It was about pure agression in the beginning. Now the line between Stone Sour and Slipknot has faded into nothing.<br />I'm not saying it's not worth your money, or that it's a bad CD because it's not. Musically they are tighter than they've ever been.<br />For people who enjoy Stone Sour more than Slipknot, this is your disc. For true Slipknot fans who worship the first album, this will be your own personal hell.
B00000IL26|5.0|Some musicians do a particularly good job of expressing their personality through their instruments.  On this album, Lee Morgan's trumpet expresses both sheer confidence and the absolute joy of playing music.  <br />This album is the cure for everyone who thinks they don't get jazz. The music is funky,bluesy, brash and extroverted.  Fans of pretty much any popular music genre will be able to react to the groove here. Yet this is no dumbed down, watered-down piece of pandering.  Instead, this was a group of highly accomplished jazz musicians playing their butts off on a really good day.<br />The re-mastering of the original Blue Note recording sessions is also excellent.  Blue Note was famous for having being best recorded sessions in jazz and this album is a good example of everything that made the label great.  You can really here the interplay between the musicians on this very clean recording, without ever having to sacrifice the soulfulness of the music.<br />Lee Morgan was one of several jazz trumpeters in the 1950s who died in a relatively young age. Play this disc and find out just what we all missed.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|OK, well, first things first. This CD is definitely a new direction for Slipknot.<BR>I really enjoyed the first 2 CDs, but this one is quite different. They have added acoustic songs, which was a mistake. They certainly have lost that edge that they had 4 years ago. <BR>I am not gonna say that you shouldn't buy this album, because I am glad I bought it, 'cause I only paid $15. Every Slipknot fan should buy this, but don't be surprised at the different sound that they have.<BR> They still retained a little bit of the awesome sound that they used to have, but they have also decided on going in a new direction, but in my opinion, it is for the worse. I just hope that their next album rectifies this inadequacy.<br />-Sic-X-n-X-the-X-head
0385720920|5.0|Reading a Chuck Palahniuk novel is a guarantee for a unique and often frightening reading experience, and CHOKE is no exception. I devoured this book in one setting and would rate it as one of my favorite Palahniuk books. CHOKE is full of social satire and rude and gutsy humor that makes one examine the world around them in an entirely different light. There are virtually no sentences that are not affected by Palahniuk's social commentary.<br />CHOKE is centered around Victor Mancini, a sex addict and con artist who works at a Colonial living museum with co-workers who tend to dabble in pot smoking and other insidious drugs while on the job. When not at work he likes to eat out at restaurants and pretend to choke in order to make unsuspecting heroes when the other patrons save his life. It is safe to say that Victor has not had a so-called normal childhood; his mother continually performed stunts at the expense of others and society when she was not in jail and was known to kidnap him and teach him important life lessons.<br />Palahniuk creates brilliant and original scenes that highly entertained and made me chuckle out loud numerous times, including Victor's relationship with the elderly patients at the nursing home and his best friend's obsession with rock collecting. Highly recommended.
B000002RXS|5.0|I don't get the previous review. Honestly I think this is one of the greatest Carmens ever recorded. My favourite is still the one with Tatyana Troyanos but the Callas-Carmen definitely has her charms. And with Gedda and Pretre every operalover's dream for Carmen was fulfilled. Enjoy!
B00005QK3D|5.0|I think if you take out their two stupid song's Heavy metal hamster's,and Pink bubbles go ape,it could of been the next Keeper's album,if they would of had a better cover that is.But let's face it Helloween did some stupid song's even on those albums.I mean I think Future world,Dr.stein and Rise,and fall are really stupid song's,and way,way to happy.But let's face it.It's pretty rare to find a album that you like every song on.And when it comes to Michael Kiskes vocals who in my oppinion are second to none.You can alway's skip those song's...So if you don't care about the cover art,and can look past a couple of stupid song's then by this album.From the hugely influentual lord's of all Power Metal Helloween.Beside's I'd rather have Michael Kiske's worst album's than have Andie Deris's or Kai Hansen's best.Although I wouldn't mind Michael Kiske redoing the Wall's of Jericho album.He sound's really good on the song Gaurdians,and ext....
0920668372|5.0|I was astonished to discover that people see this wonderful book as being about stalkers, incestuous relationships, guilt, etc., etc.  NOW I know who comes up with the subjects for vile talk shows - and who watches them.<br />Get a grip, people.  This is a book about the deep, unceasing love that parents have for their children, and which they pass on through the family. Love creates love.  It takes it to absurd lengths to make a point.  If you're taking it literally, you seriously need psychiatric help; or maybe you've never loved.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I am still in disbelief!  I loved Avril's first CD - so much, that I've listened to it for over a year!  I purchased this CD and was shocked!  Shocked that is plain and simply STINKS!  There are NO HITS on this CD.  Avril's shrill and shreiking songs are poorly written and produced.  There is absolutely NO PERSONALITY on this CD, NONE!!<br />I think this album could set a new record...Quickest from release to the $.99 bin!!  Two thumbs down for this lemon!!
B000000P17|4.0|I figured this album would be like a two star thing when I bought it. But I was quite suprised when I found out it was very good. Apart from several mediocre songs, this is a great album of classic punk and hard rock covers. Some of them downright stink, which is why this album only recieved 4 stars. But some of them rock like there is no tommorrow. Often Axl Rose makes strange sounds with his voice. If you are looking for the heaviest GNR song ever, check out Ain't It Fun with its almost death metal chorus. This is a great bargain for any hard rock/metal fan, but if you are a beginner on this band, I would advise you to check out Appetite For Destruction or the Use Your Illusion albums first.
B000001E7V|5.0|I stayed away from this CD for the longest, scared of what I might hear--I mean Tricky does look slightly demonic.  But all that aside, \\"Maxinquaye\\" turned out to be just the opposite of what my initial perception was.  It is in fact a masterpiece that can only be tantamount to the works of Massive Attack, Portishead and even DJ Shadow.  With sexy vocals from Martina and Tricky himself, \\"Maxinquaye\\" keeps it appeal in 2004 with material that doesn't at all sound dated or forced, but instead sounds fresh and innovative as the day it was released.  Tricky is truly a \\"trip-hop pioneer.\\"  \\"Maxinquaye\\" is haunting, sexy, profound, intense and down right funky!  Highly Recommended!
B0001UL7RY|1.0|The last thing we need is another pop star sucking up the air waves; we have enough Michelle Branches and Jessica Simpsons already.  And this one claiming to be a skater?  I skated throughout high school, and I can assure you that rubbish like this was never listened to by me or my friends; we listened to Minor Threat, Pantera and Cypress Hill.  What kills me is that this is actually popular; one of the guys at my work actually bragged about this album coming out, and I nearly slapped him.  (...)
B000002JS8|3.0|this was the perfect way for Bon to go(R.I.P Bon we all miss you) Highway ton hell is a hard rock masterpiece especially with songs such as the title track &quot;Girls got rhythm&quot; &quot;touch too much&quot; &quot;shotn down in flames&quot; and the 6 minute plus &quot;night prowler&quot; which later gained controversy linking the song to a murder suspect this album is defintly one of my favorite classic rock almbums i just wish bon wouldnt have died so we could see how much further he could have taken it.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Another hard-whacker from Priest! Now, we all know that Judas Priest are the Metal Gods, and are one of the best bands out there. But on this they are THE best band out there. Sheer, sheer heaviness is exhibited on this album. Everything fits perfectly. Rob's vocal talents lay perfectly on top of KK and Glenn's guitars. Also, the bass and drums are some of the best in rock, let alone metal history. Like somebody wrote on a list, Electric Eye is probably the album's standout track. With that guitar intro, how could you go wrong? This is definitely one of the most essential albums to be released ever.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm proud to announce that I own all of the Radiohead CDs, and although this isn't my favorite one, it takes a close second--&quot;Kid A&quot; being my fave--that's right, I said it!!!  &quot;OK Computer&quot; is a phenomenal album, with outstanding musicianship and the usual stunning falsetto vox of Mr. Thom Yorke.  Present on &quot;OK Computer&quot; are the rock elements of all the albums since Pablo Honey and the electronica of &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot;.  Truly this is one of the greatest alternative rock CDs ever released.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I see a trend in reviews that this is a hybrid album of Slipknot and Stone Sour; tracks 6, 8, and 11 (while not being bad songs, they're just not Slipknot) only help to encourage that belief.  My personal problem with this album is that it sounds a little too close to Pantera; I like Pantera but I want Slipknot for its unforgiving brutality.  It's even hard to tell on this album that there is a dj and a sampler present.  Therefore, I must say I still favor the first two albums, but this one is quickly growing on me.  The solos rule and Corey can still growl and scream with the best of them.  It is a great shame that this might be their final album, but reviewers, please don't liken this to Metallica's &quot;Load&quot; - that's just wrong on so many levels.  The black album was Metallica's sellout point, &quot;Load&quot; just proved that they lost it.
B00006AFUR|5.0|okay, mostly i never write a review for things, but this is to good to pass up. this is the best cd ive ever had.  i listen to it constantly, when i play video games, riding in the car, going to bed, on the bus, everywhere!!<BR>you should definitely buy this cd.  its hard to describe what kind of music it is.  its kind of like space rock.  it sounds wierd but its incredible,  it blends soo well together.  here is what i think<br />Capricorn - 5/5<BR>Edge of the Earth - 5/5<BR>Fallen - 5/5<BR>Oblivion - 5/5<BR>Buddha for Mary - 6/5<BR>Echelon - 5/5<BR>Welcome to the Universe - 5/5<BR>The Mission - 4.5/5 (least fav. song and i give 4.5!)<BR>End of the Beginning - 5/5<BR>93 Million Miles - 5/5<BR>Year Zero - 5/5<br />thats what i think of the cd
0553212540|4.0|Basil Harwood talks to his friend, Lord Henry Wotton, about his latest painting, a portrait of a striking young man named Dorian Gray to whom he has taken quite a fancy.  He feels that his art has never been alive as it has since meeting this young man.  Intrigued at his friends acute interest, Lord Henry determines to meet the young man himself, and quite by chance, manages to remain in the studio as Dorian arrives and stands for the finishing touches to his portrait.<br />Once it is completed, Lord Henry comments on how youthful the painting is, remarking how unfortunate it is that the portrait will always remain as young as on the day it was painted, whereas Dorian will slowly age, losing his youth and looks to time.  Dorian frets over this and says that he would give anything if only his portrait would age instead of him.<br />Weeks later, after an unfortunate scene with his fianc&eacute;e, Dorian notices a subtle change to his portrait, a certain cruel turn of the lips.  As the days pass, he notices more changes and begins to realize that he can commit every vice and cruelty imaginable without any harm coming to him.  His portrait will bear the brunt of his adventures.  But at what price?  As the years pass, he begins to wonder about the state of his very soul and if he can change, perhaps bring the portrait back to its original beauty.<br />This is a great novel, dealing for the most part with man's quest for eternal youth.  Who wouldn't want to stay young forever?  We go through fad diets, gyms, botox, plastic surgery -- all in the name of trying to remain healthy and youthful.  Dorian is given a unique opportunity, the consequences of which show him the havoc that all the vices and cruel acts have upon his soul (or his conscience).  We also get to see how getting what you wish for doesn't always turn out the way you thought it would.<br />It's a well-written story, full of unique characters. The majority of the male characters seem to have no problem whatsoever having intimate relationships with other men.  By his actions, Basil appears to be in love with Dorian.  Dorian, in turn, is infatuated with Lord Henry, even thought both of them do have relationships with women (for Dorian, a fianc&eacute;e; for Lord Henry, a wife).  There's even a bit of jealousy on the part of Lord Henry's wife when she finally meets the man who's been monopolizing her husband's time.<br />At times, though, it does move slowly due to long passages discussing the place of art in society and philosphizing about the quest for youth and beauty.  In these passages the text seems to turn more into a lecture rather than a novel.  That, however, does not take away from the enjoyment of the novel.having intimate relationships with other men.

B00004XONN|5.0|The reviews on &quot;Kid A&quot; have been mixed, with more folks bashing the album than loving it.  This personally is my favorite Radiohead album due to it's more subdued and &quot;electronic&quot; nature.  Yes, there is still elements of rock as heard on &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot;, but it's the subtle changes in musical textures that really wins me over--not to mention Thom Yorke's chilly, almost ethereal vocals!  At any rate, I won't repeat what has already been stated so eloquently from 5, 4 and even a few 3 star reviewers--but I will say that Radiohead has opened my eyes and ears to a whole new style of music that I can appreciate more now than I did a year ago.
B000053VAZ|4.0|This is a very good movie. It gives insights into what it is to be mentally challenged in a tough world.  Johnny Depp's character is brilliant.
B000003S09|5.0|this is the BEST ALBUME EVER. if you had only 1 chance to listen to any record , listen to this.  My fav song is &quot;The Court Of The Crimson king&quot; BEST SONG EVER. BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY!!!!!!!!
0393312836|4.0|An interesting disutopic sci-fi book on alienation, violence and misogyny. It was even more interesting when I read that it had been published with different endings.<br />I wasn't as impressed with Burgess' using non-English words, because I speak Russian and that's all the &quot;slang&quot; really was. (Example, the Russian word for Friend is Droog; Hand is Ryka; Milk is Moloko). Therefore it was immediately apparent to me though I liked the mixing of the two languages it reminded me of how I talk at home using both languages interchangeably.   In a way I wish I could've read the book as most people did (who didn't use the glossary) and try to figure out the words through context.
031286504X|5.0|I am Legend is the best of two of my favorite genres; post-apocalyptic fiction and vampire stories.  Reading this for the first time many years after it was published, it is amazing to see how much it has influenced movies and books that came later.  It's a very quick read that makes you wish it were longer.
B0001UZZWW|2.0|Most people are missing the point of the short film featuring Shrek. The short film is the tie in between the first Shrek movie and where the second one begins. The short feature is only 16 minutes long and was originally made for Universal Studios. I saw this film in October of 2003 knowing that the new Shrek film would be out in 2004. The thing is if you have seen this film at Universal Studios in Orlando Florida and try to see this film with 3-d glasses at home, you will be very disappointed. 3-d at home is a lose lose proposition. At universal orlando the 3-d effects were out of this world. As well at Disney World. They also adde elements of feathers on your heels, spraying of mist and even scent. I want the short and been trying to find it by itself but have been unsuccessful. You have to buy the short with the first movie. I do recommend getting the short movie because it is a great Shrek &quot;movie&quot; but I don't recommend watching it in 3-d. I wonder now what will Universal Orlando show because the 2nd one is out? I rated it two stars because 3-d movies like this one and spy kids 3d have poor 3-d quality when viewed at home. The movie is excellent though and I rate that 4 stars.
0066620996|4.0|This was a not great, but still good book about the factors that allow companies to get \\"over the hump\\" to become successful long-term.  <br />This differs from other books that crowd this over-overpacked genre because of it's focus on companies that, rather than going hog-wild about big-name execs and the latest and greatest computer gadgets, don't treat their employees like commodities ready for the outsourcing mill.  Collins' book shows how successful companies focus on cultivating their people-- on picking the best ones, nurturing their drive to buy into the corporate mission, and building work relationships among each other that are strong enough to get thru the down times.  <br />This book is good if nothing else as an antidote to all the hoopla out there about how employees are dispensable and easily replaceable.  It's this poor set of ideas that causes so many companies to look at employees like just some other number on the balance sheet and outsource jobs abroad in a way that the employee relationships and teamwork aren't built up.  These companies can have success for a while, but they tend to break down long term because they lack those basic relationships among it's core people, all the trust that's needed to bring the company thru those tough trials when they come.
B000002HEP|5.0|If I could give this album 10 stars I would. I truly cannot begin to explain how great this album is, from the beginning riff or &quot;Gardenia&quot; to the instrumental end to &quot;Whitewater&quot; The first time i heard this album it just hit me hard and I had to listen again. I didnt listen to any other album for probably 3 months after I bought this. I just knew I was experiencing something momentous. Its incredible that no talent bands like Linken Park, Nickelback and Creed make it big but the bands with real talent like Kyuss dont. Oh well, that's simple music for simple people
B0000CC5CS|4.0|These 1-star reviews of this movie are just ridiculous.  Obviously written by bored wierdos on the Internet with nothing better to do than pleasure themselves to the scenes from T2 with Linda Hamilton in a T-shirt or something.<br />The fact of the matter is that T3 is a fun, effective action movie and a worthwhile sequel to T2.  Arnold does a shockingly good job pulling off a role he started about 20 years ago, though his days of getting away with teleporting onto the screen naked are probably coming to an end.  It also has one of the better endings I've seen in the movies lately.  While you can tell that Cameron didn't direct this movie (it has a very different &quot;feel&quot; from Terminator or T2), this isn't entirely a bad thing.  The bottom line is that this is a well-made and effective action/sci-fi movie.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|im here to tell you...dont listen to any moron, claiming they know ANYTHING.  think for yourself, and you will be gifted.  Naysayers, go plant a tree, or listen to something &quot;good.&quot;
0380789019|5.0|Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere is a highly imaginative, chilling tale of a normal man who's life is changed forever when he helps Door, and he is sent into the London Below.<br />This book is an awesome representation of London, showing the poor and forgotten people and slums in an interesting way (as the London Below). Very entertaining and impossible to put down! 5 stars all the way! :)
B0001NBMBC|4.0|First off I knew going in that this would be totally different than the previous two efforts. Im not a full fledged &quot;maggot&quot; by any means but I do really enjoy these guys and their music. I was extremely surprised to hear no explicit lyrics but F-bombs arent always needed to get your message across. After 3 days of listening to this album it has started to grow on me. My favorite tracks are &quot;Blister Exist&quot;, &quot;Duality&quot;, and &quot;Opium of the People&quot; but I also enjoy the acoustic tracks as well. What stands out about this album to me is  the drumming by Joey. I truly believe he played his heart out on this one. <br />All in all i like this album but not quite as much as their debut but probably about as much as Iowa (which i think is better than it gets credit for) If you buy this album expecting to hear music like on the self titled than you'll likely be disappointed. But if you go into it with an open mind and take a good hard listen you'll hear some good music
B0001BKAEY|1.0|A truly dismal movie, The Matrix Revolutions fails on all fronts, except maybe computer processor time used for the CGI.  The Matrix was an excellent sci-fi movie, and the disappointing mess of The Matrix Reloaded at least hinted at something cool happening in Part 3.  Well, we've got Part 3, and it stinks.<br />The acting has gotten progressively worse, the effects vary from awe-inspiring to lamer than old Star Trek movies, the story just kind of fizzles out like a bad beer fart, and all the potential plot twist coolness hinted at in The Matrix Reloaded is fortotten about in favor of a straightforward and numbingly dumb ending.<br />This is a bad ending to a series that should have never been made beyond the first film.  It is now clear in retrospect that the W brothers really had no clue what to do after cooking up The Matrix, and so just threw together some expensive crap and tied it together with CGI just to turn a buck at our expense.  The Matrix Reloaded and especially The Matrix Revolutions embody all the worst things about Hollywood movies: pointless sequels that replace the original sharp plotting with &quot;special&quot; effects and loud audio.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|It's always kind of sad to see a divided fanbase.  But this time the only losers are teenagers looking for just constant thrash.  I'm not here to call anybody not a true fan or whatever.  Who cares?  <br />I like all their albums, Iowa being the weakest just for the reason of having &quot;The Heretic Anthem&quot; in there.  I listen to that track and am half-annoyed, half-amused.  I don't care about the &quot;satanic&quot; part of it.  It's just a silly theme for a song.<br />This album shows maturity, growth and depth.  It has hard tracks, slow tracks, and a very good acoustic track.   There's guitar work that I've never heard before and some very awesome drumming in &quot;The Blister Exists&quot; especially.  This is simply their best album, and kids who can't see people grow up and do things for themselves are losing out.  Slipknot can't stay static.  If they did, they'd be gone in a couple years.  <br />Change is a way of life, sometimes it's good - as it is with this album.  Sometimes it's bad (Metallica from Black to Load, or pre-Napster to post-Napster if you like). <br />Just buy this album if you like Slipknot and were hoping for them to grow with you - they did.
0385510438|1.0|Not another one again! I just don't understand Mr Grisham's maniacal obssesion with juries. Who knows how many lawyer and jury books the guy has written? All I know is this: I'm sick and tired of reading about these dumb juries! The Runaway Jury was the only thing that was anywhere near decent that Grisham has poured from his stinking pen. Why does he think the average Joe is interested in judicial matters. I, for one, am not.
B000001A3H|5.0|Wow... If only every band was as good as these guys were. &quot;Thumb&quot; starts off slowly then kicks in and this album has already grabbed you by the throat and you are a slave to the music. &quot;Freedom Run&quot; is my favorite song but its so hard to pick a favorite when they're all so good. &quot;Writhe&quot; and &quot;Green Machine&quot; are very catchy. Though this album isnt as good as Sky Valley it set the table for the short lived greatness we all know as Kyuss
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This C.D. is good. It may be different from their other 3 C.D.'s. (yes three), but I respect their change.  I don't think anyone is giving them enough credit. I hope this C.D. will grow on people as it has on me.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I have to say I was in total shock when I picked this CD up. No stand out tracks, some uninspired acoustic numbers, and minimal cursing. I know thats not what the music should be about but theres no way that the cursing was left out without anyone noticing. I won't jump on the &quot;this sounds like stone sour&quot; bandwagon but those acoustic tracks don't belong. Thats not what this band is about. Evolving sound, Please?! A band that prides itself on an evil, heavy persona can not through in acoustic tracks and say &quot;Hey, were musicians&quot; Sevendust yes, slipknot NO. Speaking of musicianship this CD has none. Every song seems jummbled together, I gets no flow. I also don't like the fact that while the band memebers were with other projects they slammed the band and their image and then magically rick rubin saves the day. Doubtful. This is not the album they needed to make. Maybe they were afraid to be heavy after Iowa came out right after 9/11. Who knows. Another sad record of 2004, just like machine head, incubus, and flaw.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|the beatles are the reigning kings of music. that is that. and this is one of the greatest cd's me and my husband have listened to in some time. it includes all the songs that made the beatles huge. and some of the greatest songs ever to be released, if i may say so myself. if you don't own this album, you don't own any music.
B000083E79|5.0|How can anybody not like Cher.  Her music is top notch as a solo artist as well as the masterpieces she put together with her late husband Sonny Bono.<BR>This set collects them all and captures her magnificent voice that changed the music industry forever.<BR>I want to marry this woman!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I will admit that I have not listened to their last two cd's in their entirety mainly because they the songs I did listen to sounded similar, but not the same.  I read some previews of this cd and heard that they were going to try some new things and thought maybe I would give this cd a try.  I heard &quot;Duality&quot; and as soon as the cd came out I bought it.  I think people are arguing that they are too &quot;soft&quot; on this album but what they prove is that they have originality, and most importantly are evolving as a group.  Vermillion Pt. 2 is a great song, uncharacteristic of the group, but a good song nonetheless.  Another song &quot;Nameless&quot; may sound disjointed, but really is drastic changing from shredding to calm sounds good after a listen or two.  I loev the direction this band is headed in and can't wait till the next album comes out.  Don't beleive me though, listen to Duality, Vermilion, Vermilion Pt 2, and Nameless to get an idea of what this new album is all about.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This is a damn good cd from a damn good band. And I'm getting pretty sick and tired of these people blaming music on their children's behavior. Here's a crazy idea try being a parent. Telling your kids what they can and cant do is always gonna make them a more rebellious person your idiots. I'm sorry but im sure half these people are still stuck back in the 20's with the Rolling Stones. They sucked back then they suck now, Brusce Springsteen Sucks and all that other stupid sh*t you people listen too. It's not the music that casuses children to be hatefull its their parents stupid ass antics half the time<br />Now back to SlipKnot this is a great debut album and so are their other albums....If you dont already have this cd go get it, this is a AWESOME CD.
B00005UKKF|5.0|First she comes out with album after album of great music and now a DVD so great, it brings her to a whole new level.<BR>Britney is hot and you can witness it all here, from her dance moves to the way she entertains all.<BR>Highly, highly recommended!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Ladies and gentlemen its the new slipknot, back and even more crazier than before. Of course because of there changes (no cussing and acoustic tracks) many have now labeled slipknot as sell outs.....which makes me sick, I would like all you haters to one pick an insturment and play it. Then get toghether with 9 of your friends and see how close you can come to sounding as good as slipknot does. And all the crap about acoustic tracks not belonging on a slipknot album, well basically the answer to that is you reviewers arent slipknot and you didnt write the album so stop it. When I first heard this album I could not believe that it was still slipknot. Guitar solo's?? Thats awesome! I always knew the talent of mick and james but when I heard the solo's it was like nothing Ive ever heard. The best songs on this album are Three Nil, Opium of the People(Great Chorus), Welcome, Vermilion 1 &amp; 2, Pulse of the Maggots(Great Fight Song), Nameless, and Virus of Life. I personally like every track but those are my favorites. Another thing thats great about this album is production. For years slipknot has needed a better producer because on their earlier albums its hard to hear certain instruments, and on Vol. 3 I can hear every single instrument. The last thing I want to mention is that people should stop saying that they sound like Stonesour because both bands have a totally different message. The Knot 4 LIFE
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Many people wonder why songs like Circle and Vermillion pt. 2 are on this CD as it is the complete opposite of what Slipknot stands for. As Corey explains in his interview on Headbanger's Ball (which I hope you all saw), many of these \\"slower\\" songs were written a long time ago, pre-during Iowa. I think its great they finally had the guts to put these songs on an album and I find them enjoyable (enjoyable and Slipknot just sounds wrong). But the fact is there are still plenty of heavy songs on this CD and this isn't the first time we have heard melody and softness from Slipknot. Have we forgotten Skin Ticket, Left Behind (Radio versions of My Plague, Wait and Bleed). These songs come as no surprise to me (especially with the fact that Corey said \\"this album will put them in the books or go down in flames.\\" Hmm does this mean no changes, heavier than ever?). The only thing I am disappointed with is that maybe Slipknot held back a bit as there is no swearing, and holding back is never good (-1 star). As for the songs, most are great although some kind of blend to me (Opium, Welcome... -1 star).
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Well, well, well. What can I possibly say about this album? Can I say that, after Corey and Jim did the Stone Sour album I knew they would poison the SlipKnot sound with their psuedo grunge? Can I say that,  after the success of Stone Sour I knew the other members of the band would start seeming as if they're performing on a seperate stage, away from the all important Corey Taylor? Can I say, that after Stone Sour, SlipKnot would be put on the backburner?<br />Well, yes. I can say all of those things.<br />This album is pathetic. Gone are the days of SlipKnot being one of the most agressive bands around. Gone are the days of SlipKnot being worth the money fans shell out on them. And gone, are any strands of themselves that this band had on their two previous albums. In one album, SlipKnot changed to Slip Sour.<br />And it's really sad.<br />With Stone Sour's album, I was half impressed, half dissapointed by what was  being played. &quot;Get Inside&quot; and &quot;Orhcids&quot; were pretty good tracks. The rest of the album, including the overly annoying &quot;Bother&quot;, was dated and boring. And that's the same feeling I get from Vol. 3. The feeling of semi-controlled chaos has been left behind and replaced by desperate attempts at heavy metal.<br />If the rumors of this being the bands last album together are true, all I can say is this; This is a sad, sad way for such an amazing band to end what was a very promising career.
0316921173|5.0|I've run into several reviews of Infinite Jest where the reviewer hasn't actually been able to read the book, whether it be through laziness or incompetence but rest assured you can discard these &quot;reviews&quot; aside as unqualified. Entertainment Weekly featured one where the critic stated her review was based on the opinions of people who actually read the book. And this got published?!?<BR>It is daunting in size and complex in detail but the rich and creative style of DFW's writing is what elevates the story. The language is unique without being pretentious, the characters (there are about 30 of them) are well documented and personable and yes, the ending caught me off guard too but after digging back into the book to specific reference points, the possibilities of the conclusion are seemingly clear.<BR>There are parts of this book that are laugh out loud funny, really hysterical stuff, a couple of movingly beautiful descriptions of a seizure and an impaling death that rival Denis Johnson's &quot;Angels&quot; final scene and an undercurrent of sadness tied within the humor of America as a society willfully addicted to anything put in front of it.<BR>This is my opinion and although I loved the book, my opinion is not gospel. I just hope that others reading this review page will have the sense to disregard the &quot;reviewers&quot; on here that admit they haven't / couldn't read the book. The 'How To Be A Hipster' post is funny though!<BR>Cheers
B0001Z363W|4.0|i havent bought my copy yet, but i will soon.  i have heard it, and it is great.  its not the best by Zakk or BLS but it is great.  I expect no less than this.  in fact, it exceeded my expectaions.  <BR>as for the people dissing zakk, you dont know what he is like, about, and what his genre is.  He is a hardcore headbanger/rocker with a family.  he is a metalhead with a soft side.  take &quot;book of shadows&quot; for instance, or &quot;machine gun man&quot; off of &quot;pride and glory&quot;.  he has a very good soft side.  he is a heck of a song writer, and all of his music shows it. he also has played, writen, and hung with big names in metal such as alice in chains, rob zommbie and obviously ozzy. and for his genre, he is what ever he wants to be, cuz he can, and did or does, play anything he wants.  and thats cuz hes just that dang good.  he grew up practicing mozart and now hes playing heavy metal.  hes also played blues, jazz, and even country.  so, my rule of thumb is, if he plays it, it is good.  and he hasnt let me down on that yet.<br />in closing, all i have to say is, LIVE LONG ZAKK WYLDE<br />                   BLEED BLACK LABEL<BR>                      SDMF 4 LIFE
0393320928|4.0|This book is the follow on to the book &quot;Surely you must be joking, Mr. Feynman&quot;. In the first book there was a time line that progressed from youth to Professor at Caltech. This book is much different in that 45% of the book describes his pre- 1986 life and 55% describes his involvement in the Challenger shuttle accident investigation. This investigation was a mere 2 years of his life (and the final 2 years as well). The same brilliant character shines through in both parts of this book. There are many interesting vignettes of this iconoclast that are not in the first book. The most interesting part is the description of his relationship with his first wife Arlene who succumbed to TB while he was still a young man. He really had a great heart for those close to him. He didn't suffer fools willingly and often was abrupt to the point of rudeness. More interesting observations are available at feynmanonline^com. Detailed there is a more balanced view of the man and his foibles.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I've only had this cd for 2 days, and so far, it's growing on me. As a whole,it is not near as heavy as the two previous albums but at times it is. Not being really heavy doesn't mean it's not good. My only real problem with this album is that there are 9 members in the band, but where are they? On the first album, and even the second, you could hear all 9 members going crazy which produced a sloppy, heavy mix that was great. This album sounds like a 4 piece band. Not much going on musically. But all in all, good nu-metal.
B000002LFU|5.0|Ok, I didn't read all 89 reviews, but...       It seems that a great many reviewers have missed several points about this album. A dash of context and a little hindsight might help. First, of all, if you are familiar with Mr. Stipe, then you know how much interest he has in Andy Kaufman, having produced \\"Man On the Moon; \\" another of his film productions is \\"Being John Malkovich.\\" Stipe is interested in the cult of celebrity and a type of channeling various/varied personalities, a loss of self to some social \\"other\\".        Green's disparate songs and lyrical personalities fit these tendencies. Stipe has always been inward and obtuse; his newfound outwardness is a mask--it's him trying on these different personas.  He denounces  social graces and indifference/superficiality by channeling vapidity right on the first song, \\"Pop Song 89\\"...        Then he goes on to channel the political aspirant (\\"World Leader Pretend\\"), the handicapped (\\"Wrong Child\\"), the narrow-minded and politically oblivious (\\"Stand\\"), military leaders (\\"Orange Crush\\")--almost all in the first person. What he controls, rather brilliantly, is how these personalities are perceived: the stupid pop songs are clearly parody, but others are more genuine in their tone (\\"Hairshirt\\").  \\"World Leader Pretend\\" is really one of his best--a non-topical political commentary (hard enough to do by itself, really) that reveals insecurities and questioning beneath the bravado.        He tried it again--stylistically, without as much social commentary-- on Monster...          And that's Agent Orange covering the \\"green\\" on the cover.   Remember what it was initially used for?
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Most movies I watch and love in theatres are adventures and comedies. Having seen Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King, it became my favorite for Best Picture. After the Academy Awards I saw Mystic River and realized that the Academy Board must have had a tough decision between Mystic River And Return of the King. Clint Eastwood is a masterful director, and the cast is unmatched. Each character has a distinct set of emotions and reactions to everything that happens. The fact that the biggest question of the movie isn't answered until 5 minutes before it ends meant that the entire movie was always growing in intensity. Watch it for the academy award performances of Seann Penn and Tim Robbins, and stay for Laurence Fishburne, Kevin Bacon, and the rest of the cast. One of the years top movies, and easily worthy of being deemed a contemporary classic.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|First of all, this is certainly not a movie for everyone.  It is dreamlike, hypnotic, atmospheric and quiet and makes no pretense to being some great statement or telling some great parable.  It is impressionistic, and meant to be something you slide in to, not something that beats you over the head.  That being said, I do also feel like some people were disappointed in it because they expected either:<br />1. A \\"Bill Murray\\" movie (i.e. Groundhog Day, Scrooged)<BR>2. A \\"Romantic Comedy\\" (i.e. most Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts movies)<br />It is neither.<br />Looking back on the movie, I think the most telling sign of where it was going was the inclusion of many Kevin Shields/My Bloody Valentine tracks during the film.  MBV (a group that people also loved or hated) worked on the idea that all of the instruments, voices included, were equally important and shouldn't necessarily stand out in the mix.  This seems to be the idea behind Lost In Translation, where the setting, the actors, the characters, and the plot are all equally important (or unimportant) and not meant to take precedence.  What you're left with, if you connect with it, is a memory of a couple specific moments (notably the karaoke scene and the crazy Japanese talk show, which are two true \\"set pieces\\" of any length), and more a mood that \\"Lost\\" has set and a chance to wonder what these people actually found, because it's clear they never figured that out completely.  It is romantic, but not a cut-and-dry romance like most formualic \\"romantic\\" movies.  It's not a perfect movie (it does have even slower spots in an already slow film), and I might have liked to have a commentary track, although the bonus interview shows Sofia Coppola to be less than magnetic and interesting.  Not for everyone, but for those interested, a great rainy-day film, or one to watch in a quiet, introspective mood.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I loved this movie from the very first time I saw it. I have watched it over and over again and I'm still not sick of it. It really is the best version of Peter Pan that I've seen yet and I'm a really big Peter Pan fan. This story has been one of my favorite stories for as long as I can remember and every movie has been a little disappointing. This version is very true to the book which I think is important. If you are a fan of the book you will love this movie. <br />The soundtrack is also wonderful if you wanted to know. As soon as you see the movie you'll be humming the tunes until you realize you can't go another day without owning the soundtrack. And I highly recommend it. <br />Girls, let me tell you, Jeremy Sumpter is really cute. That was another thing about this movie that was done really well, the love story between Peter and Wendy. A lot of people don't seem to realize that the book is written that way, there is supposed to be a love story between Peter and Wendy. So why is it taken out in every other version? I think that the cast is wonderful. I couldn't think of anyone who could play Peter better than Jeremy. He has the eyes, voice, and smile of Peter Pan. <br />So, I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone, and even more so if you are a Peter Pan fan. It is a great movie with a wonderful cast and beautiful music. Watch it, and I bet you will fall in love with it in an instant...just like me!<br />Oh the cleverness of me!
B0001NBMBC|3.0|All I have to say is this is Stone Sour's second album.  Good god for acoustics and clean lyrics.  This is not Slipknot.  The vocals on this album piss me off so bad.  You don't even know.  Please release the new SLIPKNOT CD and rename this one to Stone Sour like it sounds.  Pulse of the Maggots is a good song but the vocals are still WEAK.  Where are the &quot;I eat gravel&quot; screams?  Weak...
B0001UL7RY|4.0|When I first listened to &quot;Let Go&quot;, I had never thought she was that good, by the videos on MTV. For months her first album was my favorite. I confess I was eager to listen to her new record, and now that I did, I was expecting some more. Avril has a beautiful voice, specially for ballads, but in this album looks like she's tired. The songs don't have the same feeling, that entusiasm of a first record that &quot;Let Go&quot; had. It's weak, and although it's a short album (around 40 min.), it's a bit difficult to listen to. You gotta listen more than one time to start liking it.<br />&quot;Under My Skin&quot; is not a bad album. Perhaps the production could be better, or could be better arranged. The songs have more rage, their louder, angrier (&quot;Take Me Away&quot;, &quot;Forgotten&quot;, &quot;Freak Out&quot;), and it made Avril lose some of the harmony she could achieve between her nice voice and the guitars. But I don't think it's only her fault. She's very young, and I think the pressure is so much that maybe she just need to be alone to make good music.<br />Although it's a difficult album, there are many highlights you'll notice after some times you play the album. The first single, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is the best song from the whole record, 'cause it looks like it has been taken from &quot;Let Go&quot;. &quot;How Does It Feel&quot; and &quot;Slipped Away&quot; are beautiful ballads. &quot;He Wasn't&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; and &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot; would complete the party. The rest of the album is not that bad, but could be better.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Slipknot are one the best heavy bands to ever come out since Pantera, Metallica, Slayer, and Cannibal Corpse. It's so amazing how nine guys from Iowa that wear creepy masks and different colored coveralls can create such sick chaotic but awesome music with so much anger and adrenaline. Comparing Slipknot to that phony punk poser Avril Lavigne is a big mistake. This band kicks the sh** out of her anytime anywhere. Best songs include (Sic), Eyeless, Wait And Bleed, Surfacing, and Spit It Out.
B00006879E|5.0|Who knew a white band could have so much soul?  I kid, I kid.  However, I have to say that I absolutely ADORE this CD.  It's like listening to a story about a guy's rollercoaster relationship with his girlfriend, Jane.  There's an edgy, alternative rock sound added to soulful, stirring lyrics, and a great vocalist.<br />I think I love this CD so much because it blends a lot of genres that I dig: soul, rock, alternative.<br />Even if you're not a &quot;rock&quot; head, I would recommend this CD because there will be a song (I would say SEVERAL songs) that will touch you and pull you in.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is one the greatest movies ever! Better than the first! Better action, creautres, and some new characters! I recommend this movie to anyone!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Man...I wasn't sure if I would get this CD, but I am so glad I did.  I love hip hop that contains mind-blowing beats with hard-hitting, edgy, conscientous rhymes, and West does that and so much more on this CD.  The skits are hilarious and potent, but then again, so is the whole CD.<br />If you haven't peeped this, make it your MUST-BUY now.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem For A Dream is not for the faint of heart. If you buy this movie thinking you're getting just some conventional, nonchalant film, you are sorely mistaken. Never before have I seen a film that displays the deterioration of people's lives as a result of substance abuse so realistically before.<br />The story of the film follows four characters: Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Marion Silver (Jennifer Connelly), and Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans). Harry and Tyrone are heroin addicts who want to get into dealing to make some real money. The reason Harry wants to make money is to help his girlfriend, Marion, open a store where she can sell her fashion designs. Sara Goldfarb is Harry's mother. She gets a call one day to invite her to be a contestant on a TV show. She is old and out of shape and decides to go on a diet to fit in her favorite red dress to wear on her big day. The diet is futile because she can't handle not indulging herself in the foods she used to eat. So she sees a dieting specialist who gives her diet pills (methamphetamines). At first she loves them and loses a lot of weight, but as time goes on she builds a tolerance and begins taking double, and even triple doses...<br />To be frank, Requiem For A Dream is an assault on you. After you've watched it you feel both mentally and physically drained, much like the characters in the film. Viewing the deaths of these people's dreams is a trying experience, but honestly, it teaches you the true horrors of substance addiction.<br />To me, a powerful film is one that can alter your view on things and change the way you act. Requiem For A Dream affected me in that way and I honestly believe if more people viewed this film it would greatly decrease the likelihood for experimentation with drugs.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This record really shows that Avril does indeed write her own song.  Her voice has also matured a lot.
B000002OX5|5.0|To say that this is a great album is an understatement.  What it is an example of is this:  Back in the 60's when you bought an LP you really didn't know what you'd get, what new sounds you'd hear, what odd little things might happen on the way through the grooves.  It was a fun experience and one that, sadly, generations since have missed.  Like &quot;Sgt Pepper,&quot; &quot;Are you Experienced&quot; and &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; there was an exploratory adventure going on between the artist(s) and the listener.  That's just one of the things that made the 60's so very unique.  the Who's creativity wasn't so concerned with commercial success as it was with being unfettered and bold and those qualities shine on this incredible album.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Despite its interesting premise and moments of heartwarming charm, &quot;Big Fish&quot; is more of a movie minnow in terms of its ability to satisfy the audience's appetite for engaging characters, enticing plot or enlightening themes. Weirdly enough, despite the big names, the biggest problem with this movie is the casting, which ranges from ludicrous (canonical New Yorkers De Vito and Buscemi as alleged Southerners, doing the worst accents ever captured on film) to merely bland (a sleepwalking Crudup and his generically French wife, plus Jessica Lange as a wooden stage prop) to earnest but utterly inapt (McGregor in the lead role) to actively irritating (Finney in the other lead role). Bonham-Carter is probably the only cast member who didn't embarrass herself. The script is also soggy, but it could have worked if the actors had made us care about the characters in the slightest; but they didn't. Basically a disappointing film that wasn't worth sitting through for the sake of a moving and well-crafted ending.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|under my skin is DEFINATLY better than Let Go.  even though they're both awesome.  this one avril had more control over.  so ya here's my opinions for each song:<br />1. Take Me away - awesome rock song.  good opening song.  it's been on the radio sometimes. VERY good 4/5<br />2. Together - one of the songs she wrote with Chantal Kreviazuk. pretty good.  i like it alot.  avril'll do good if she sticks with this kinda music 5/5<br />3. Dont Tell Me - every1's herd it.  its good. but not the best song on the album, i dont think it shoulda been the debut single 3/5<br />4.  He Wasn't - good song!! i love it! it gets me head banging lol.  it's kinda like a lillix/yellowcard song.   its really good.  definatly avril's most &quot;punk&quot; song..even though she isn't punk.  5/5<br />5. How Does It Feel? - good song.  1st ballad on the cd.  it's ok.   kinda repetitive though,  it's alot like a chantal kreviazuk song from Colour Moving and Still 3/5<br />6. My Happy Ending - AWESOME!!!!!!! i think it's gonna be her next single 5/5<br />7. Nobody's Home - GREAT!! awesome depressing song.  hahaha.  she wrote it with Ben Moody (formerly from Evanescence) it isn't really like an evanescence song.  but it's a REALLY good song.  Ballad #2...well its sorta a ballad i dunno. 10/5<br />8. Forgotten - another awesome song. i think it's my fav on the album.  it's alot like Alanis Morissette's &quot;jagged little pill&quot; era of stuff.   except betteer cuz its avril  :P  15/5<br />9. Who knows - megh. it's ok.  its a happy song.  nothing outstanding though 3/5<br />10. Fall To Pieces - wow.  another awesome song.  it sounds ALOT like an Our Lady Peace song. i guess it's cuz she co-wrote it with Raine Maida...lol.  but it's really good.  i could see (or hear i guess) Raine singing this song.  ballad #3  10/5<br />11. Freak Out - megh.  same as #9.  its good.  it sounds alot like something from her 1st record.  but hey, its still good 3/5<br />12. Slipped Away - Ballad #4.  a really really really sad song.  she wrote it about her grandfather who died in the summer. its REALLY depressing.  whoever doesn't even feel sadness is cold 5/5
B0001I562I|4.0|I waited a long time for this to come out on dvd. Bugs me that the companies don't get it right the first time though. They release the dvd with no extras what so ever just so they can release a special edition a few months later. Disney did the same thing with Tron. I'm sure they have a lot of stuff they could've put on this dvd but they chose otherwise. I would've liked to see some trailers at least and it doesn't even look like it has any.<br />  Anyway  Flight of the Navigator is a great movie for the whole family. It's under-rated and a lot of people might not even have heard of it. It's about a boy who's accidently sent to the future by an alien space ship. When he finds his family they wonder why he hasn't aged a day. Scientists then run tests on him to find out where he was. He decides to escape and find a way back to the past and getting a ride on the space ship is the only way back. Once he gets on the ship is when the movie turns more goofy as the alien is voiced by Paul Reubens (Pee Herman) after all. The movie is still tons of fun and it does have some clever science fiction in it too for a kids movie. So eventhough the dvd has no extras what so ever the movie itself is worth checking out.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|After the 80's, I thought...that's it for music. It's been done and I'll just fade away listening to Ultravox and Simple Minds. Not so fast, I just bought Franz Ferdinand's latest based on a newspaper review. I haven't heard music like this since the early to mid 80's. As I started listening, I first thought...hmmm Blur, then I said to myself...hmmm Duran Duran (first 2 records), then I thought hmmmm Chic...hmm the Clash's London Calling, then Gang of Four (the guitar riffs). Even though the production is so so, the bands focus is sharp. It makes you forget the lack of fullness to the sound. The tunes are so cleverly written, the riffs so nostalgic yet the songs are very NOW. It would be interesting to transport these guys back to the 80's and hear what they might have produced. It would have been revolutionary. I'm happy now anyway listening to Franz Ferdinand in 2004.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|OK, after writing my first review and reading back over other people's resons for hating the CD, I decided to express my own views on people calling Slipknot &quot;sell-outs.&quot; First off, why does everyone blast Stone Sour? It's one of Corey's shining moments as a writer and vocalist. And if anything, why did none of the people blasting this CD now label Corey as being a sell-out when he came out with &quot;Bother&quot;? Anyway, with that said, this is just an example of how sad of a state metal as a whole is now. When Metallica came out with &quot;I Disappear,&quot; people labeled them sell-outs...why? When Metallica came out with &quot;Load,&quot; people labeled them sell-outs...for cutting their hair. It's a sad day in all of metal if you judge a band by their hair length. If you're going to do that, why don't you label Slipknot sell-outs for letting their hair down? This is the reason nu-metal is dying, and quickly; fans of nu-metal don't have an open mind enough to support their favorite band in their time of change and experimentation. I'm an avid nu-metal fan, don't get me wrong, but whereas I was open-minded enough to accept the new Knot, others weren't, and that's very sad. Oh, and last bit of information...between albums (Iowa and this one), Corey's wife had a baby. Now, I would like to see any of you lyric writers/singers out there write about slitting someone's throat after having a child. It changes your views on the world when the miracle of birth occurs, and that's the main reason why Corey toned it down a bit for this CD. I would highly recommend it still for anyone who hasn't rushed out and bought it yet.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is one of my favorite movies.  It has action, drama, great cinematography, outstanding fight scenes, love, great acting, and most importantly, it's a great story.<br />For those who haven't seen it I don't want to give away the entire plot.  Briefly, Maximus, the virtuous and victorious commander of the Roman army over the Visigoths, is asked by the dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius, to become the protectorate of Rome upon his death and return the rule of law to the Senate, making Rome once again a Republic.  Aurelius's evil and ambitious son, Commodus - fully expecting to made emperor himself - will have none of it, striking out against his father and destroying Maximus.  Maximus becomes a slave, then a gladiator, eventually finding himself fighting in the Roman Coliseum in front of his nemesis, Commodus.<br />The story has somewhat of classic plot line - similar in some ways to the Tale of Monte Cristo as Maximus seeks revenge, but more than revenge, he seeks to carry out the wishes of a dying emperor and a higher cause.  The movie also paints Maximus as the classic Republican citizen, who wants nothing more after securing victory for Rome than to go home to his family and farm.  Unfortunately, events conspire against him as he forced to make yet another sacrifice for this country.  Even at the bitter end he seeks to serve Rome.<br />On a side note, unlike others I didn't find the special features that interesting.  They were pretty typical \\"The Making Of\\" documentaries.  And the historical piece was not that new, to me at least.
B00004XONN|5.0|The first time I heard Kid A was on a late night drive. I popped the CD in and immediately began to feel as if I was driving a spacecraft exploring undiscovered alien worlds. Everything WASN'T In Its Right Place. It was unsettling and eerie, but highly captivating.  I almost had to stop the car...<br />First of all, this album should be heard from start to finish, without skipping tracks.  Forget about traditional song structure, sounds and themes. Just let the music hit you. A beautiful wall of soundscapes, noise, rhythms, computer generated notes, and unearthly melodies will erupt and burrow themselves into your psyche. It may take a few listens to really appreciate the breadth and depth of the music, but it's worth the effort because the album is a brilliant work of art.<br />Volumes have been written trying to describe the music, so I'll try a keep it short. The closest comparison I can make to try to explain the sound is imagine Miles Davis' Bitches Brew mixed with Pink Floyd's Meddle. However, the music comes out altered through the Radiohead machine. Buy the CD and see for yourself...

B0000A7W14|5.0|An exemplary directorial debut from John Singleton, who managed to create an American classic with his first effort.<br />As we follow Tre Styles from childhood toward becoming a young adult (as played effectively by Cuba Gooding, Jr.), and attempting to dodge, with the cautious guidance of his parents, the many dangers and risks associated with growing up in inner-city America, the sense of ever-present danger and, often, hopelessness associated with attempting to avoid falling into the cracks of society is abundantly clear.<br />In the role of Tre's troubled friend Dough Boy, Ice Cube is something of a revelation, and his balanced performance, alongside Singleton's excellent script, prevent him from becoming merely another gangster caricature. Lawrence Fishburne and Morris Chestnut add further depth to a strong cast.<br />All in all a very real, gritty depiction of the challenges faced at every turn by African American men and women in modern America. The building anger bristling beneath the surface in so many scenes is particularly resonant given the outburst of violence in the Rodney King Riots that took place in the very same city of the story just one year later.<br />The film spawned several 'urban gang flick' imitations in subsequent years, but most glorified violence and placed an emphasis on a loud soundtrack and sexual explicitness at the expense of strong plot-line, good character development and a serious social message. All three are to be found in Boyz N the Hood.

B00009V7T2|5.0|Alright, when i first got a hold of this album, my reaction was &quot;what the hell is this crap&quot; but being the patient listener that i am, i gave a couple more spins and this thing grew on me like no other, &quot;eritarka&quot; is simply a beautiful song, personally, i like the ambinet moments which then lead up to barrages of vocals and guitars. i give this 5 stars because of the fact that they are different from anything out there and in a world where music is very abundant, this band just stand out.
0316168815|2.0|I had a hard time believing this was actually a 14-year-old girl narrating - she felt like an adult to me.  Better books with (believable) teenage narrators:  Feeling Sorry for Celia, Shadow Baby, An Egg on Three Sticks.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|I came across this album after hear &quot;time is running out&quot; on indie 103.1, at first i thought to myself &quot;damn this guy sounds like thom yorke, maybe i should pass on this&quot; but then i heard &quot;stockholm syndrom&quot; and i knew this was a keeper.  after a couple more listens, i could totally distinguish thome yorke's and matt belamy's voices easily because they are both unique, the whole band is unique. i would say this album's a mix between yes bends era radiohead and an alicia keys piano solo if she were on acid. highly recommended.
0393307050|3.0|The first in the Aubrey-Matruin series displays all of O'Brian's erudition, with only some of the verve and narrative mastery of the books that came shortly thereafter.  Essentially a series of cruises through the Mediterranean, the novel lacks the strong narrative arc that many of the other novels posses and it suffers for the lack.<br />Nevertheless, Master and Commander remains a fascinating and compelling story of life at sea during the Napoleonic wars.  Captain Jack Aubrey and Surgeon Steven Maturin are here revealed, for the first time, in all their complexity and humanity.<br />If you find yourself getting slowed down by this book, muddle through.  The rewards will be great when you dive into the next several books, beginning with number two, Post Captain.
B00003W8NM|5.0|David Fincher, hands down is one of my favorite Directors working in film. Seven,The Game, Fight Club, Panic Room and even Alien 3(The script sucked, wasnt his fault)are examples of how a Great Director can make or break a Film. Finchers style fits Palahniuk's visions perfectly from Novel to Film. Im not going to rehash the plot here but pick this one up if you havent already. In fact grab anything by Fincher, he rarely dissapoints you, even if the material he is working with is sub-par. Fight Club isnt though and he parades us through Edward Norton's world of insomniac laden malcontent, a  lifestyle of the 90's male stereotype. &quot;We are a generation of Men raised by women.&quot; Tyler tells us, raised in a era of Divorce and materialism.Youre not your f*&amp;(n khaki's!  Still though, Buy it now!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I'm really really really F**king tired of these probably 13-18 year olds with NO experience of music saying this sounds like Stone Sour. People really need to shut the hell up about this. If you want Stone Sour, buy their cd, this is SLIPKNOT and shut the f**k up!!!!!!! But one good thing, people who buy the cd and hate it are really supporting the band so I'm ok with people buying and throwing it away.
1878424319|4.0|This book was a good, fast read - though I found it slightly too 'new-agey' for my tastes. Nonetheless, the author does a wonderful job of breaking down very elusive principles into very simple, easy to understand steps toward lightening the load of stress, self-doubt and limiting behaviors we all struggle with.
B000099T3P|4.0|Director:  Stephen Herek<BR>Cast:  Dee Wallace, M. Emmett Walsh, Scott Grimes, Don Opper, Terrence Mann.<BR>Running Time:  87 minutes.<BR>Rated PG-13 for violence, some gore, and language.<br />Possessing all of the ingredients of a sure cult-classic even while still in the theaters, &quot;Critters&quot; is an extremely enjoyable science-fiction monster yarn that will make you laugh, scream, and cr...(well not cry), well you get the idea.  The premise is simple and humorous all the same:  A spaceship directed by fiendish little alien creatures that are searching for blood crashlands on earth on a farm owned by Dee Wallace and M. Emmett Walsh.  Their rambunctious teenage son, played by Scott Grimes, suspects that something is up, but he can not convince his parents otherwise--only the goofy repair man Opper believes Grimes.  The aliens speak their own hilarious extra-terrestrial language, roll into balls when they need to gain ground on their pray, shoot sedative porcupine needles, and grow larger with every victim that they eat.<br />In hot pursuit of the evil little creatures are two bounty hunters that can change forms and faces.  These crazy characters are nearly as tormenting as the flesh-eating critters, shooting their bazookas all over the place and causing a stur.  While almost too ridiculous to be believable, the great cast does a fine job keeping a straight face and with the blend of a few genuine scares, &quot;Critters&quot; is a superb, campy romp similar to frighteningly funny flicks such as &quot;Killer Klowns from Outer Space&quot; and &quot;Gremlins&quot;.  One of the better little gems of the horror genre in the middle 1980's.  Spawned three sequels--but the original is the best.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|this is easily slipknot's best cd. they've added more singing and less growling. they've added guitar solos. they've made accoustic songs and even a song with just corey singing and a keyboard. rick rubin did a heck of a job. no longer is slipknot nu-metal. they are now true metal.
6305313687|5.0|Director:  Tony Kaye<BR>Cast:  Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Fairuza Balk, Beverly D'Angelo, Stacy Keach, Jennifer Lien.<BR>Running Time:  118 minutes.<BR>Rated R for some extreme violence, harsh language, and sexual situations.<br />There are certain films that come out that raise enough commotion due to a political (\\"Schindler's List\\"), religous (can anyone say \\"The Passion of the Christ\\"?), and historical themes that are sensitive issues for many people.  Many of these films reveal to be an honest portrayal of the account in which they are trying to explain.  \\"American History X\\" focuses on the horrors that the root of racism can breed, spreading aimlessly throughout a small California town, and sucking in innocent young adults into a world of fascist and prejudice living.<br />Edward Norton gives the best performance of his young career as a skinead Neo-Nazi who returns from prison to his Venice beach home.  His evolution from a young, bright jock in high school to a thug full of hatred is a rigid, cunning depiction--but the film mainly focuses on his metamorphesis into an enlightened parolee and his relationship with a young brother (played exceptionally well by Edward Furlong, star of \\"The Terminator 2: Judgement Day\\") who is following in his toxic foosteps.  Director Tony Kaye's vision of how racism ravages a middle-class family is staggering until the last few moments of the motion picture, taking the audience through a whirlwind of events that will shock, disturb, and expose the true nature of hate--and also the strength and courage that it takes to break the chain.<br />Truly one of the most important films of the last decade, \\"American History X\\" is a bold statement that is not for all--adults and children alike; however, it sends a message and tells a story that should be embraced by all people and is articulate enough with its delivery to create a monsoon of emotion.  One of the best films of the latter part of the decade.
6302424887|2.0|I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago in my English class and was really looking forward to it, after having enjoyed reading the play. I was really disapointed. The music was pretty bad and at the very begining you hear someone coughing in the background. The youngest of the witches is now known in our class as &quot;The Bunny&quot;. The acting done by Francesca Annis as Lady MacBeth was absolutly horrible and at times annoying. She was suppost to be the dominating and controling factor over her husband, but instead she was sweet and sappy. At points where she was supost to be angry she was sucking up to her husband and crying! Then their was the witches in the cave or &quot;the grotto, where the Bunnies got their start,&quot; as we now call it, was just plain out stupid. I mean honestly, was it really neccesary for about a dozen old women to be dancing around completley nude?!? Also did we really have to see Francesca's behind during the sleep walking scene. And one other thing, than I'm done,I promise, if your egar to see MacBeth die in the end, make sure your fast forward button is working on your VCR. MacBeth and MacDuff have a sword fight for about 10 minutes, in which at one point, MacBeth's crown falls off and he stops fighting to go pick it up and put it back on his head. Finally he is stabbed, you think that's it,all thats left is to cut off his head, well that does happen, only after MacBeth is shocked that he is stabbed then starts climbing the steps, for about another 2 minutes. But finally he meets his inevitable doom. Finally!
B00000ILDF|2.0|Director:  David Fincher<BR>Cast:  Sigourney Weaver, Charles Dutton, Charles Dance, Paul McGann, Brian Glover.<BR>Running Time:  115 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<br />While it is unfair to expect any of the &quot;Alien&quot; sequels to equal the originality of the 1979 tale and the explosiveness of the 1986 follow-up &quot;Aliens&quot;, this third installment is a bitter disappointment.  Director David Fincher, known for making excellent cinematic experiences with lavish special effects and intense cuts does create a visually stunning picture, but does not have the ensemble cast or the script to produce and effective, intelligent, and respectable science fiction thriller.<br />Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash lands on an all-but-deserted penal colony that is used for housing madmen, murderers, and rapists.  The acid-spitting, flesh-eating alien creature has, unfortunately (for Ripley, the crew, and entire viewing audience of this poor sequel), hitches a ride with our heroine and again the battle against extra-terrestrial evil continues.  Weaver is once again very good as the tough, charismatic Ripley, but she is not supported well by the cast.  She was extremely lucky to have great colleagues in &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens&quot;, but &quot;Alien 3&quot; proves that her luck has run out.  Dark, uninspiring, and an overall mess.  Loyal fans of the series will enjoy, but this film should not expect too many darkhorse followers--stick with the first two.
0679735259|5.0|I've read this book about a hundred times, and I suspect I'll continue to read it forever. The prose, the descriptions of times and places, and comrades are brilliant. Many times I've showed my wife a passage that Herr has written as an example of what great writing should read like. I've tried to capture in my readings on Vietnam what the experience must have been like, and Herr is the only author that has helped me put a framework around that. I've recommended this book well over 100 times over these past years to anyone looking for an explanation of what Vietnam was, including the lunacy and the real stories underneath the &quot;official command&quot; stories, This is a must read (and own).
B00006JLX4|2.0|ok, this band is not that good.<BR>Plain and Simple.<BR>They sound like Beck trying to Cover Weezer songs!<BR>Whoever said that they are the 90's version of Sgt. Pepper or any Beatles CD is a MORON because this band has no talent compared to the beatles.  They have some talent, but not enough to impress me.  I must say that some of their tunes are catchy but other than that they are average underground to me.<BR>Also, Contuid for Sale sounds like Primus, but in this case, not in a good way.<BR>  If you really want the 90's version of SGT. Pepper, it's RadioHead...look at their transformation from songs like &quot;creep&quot; to &quot;Motion Picture SOundtrack.&quot; Anyways, yeah, Pavement is just another band that making weird music that doesnt sound good, and attracting alot of emo kids and underground kids to it...just Go listen to The Beatles, or Radio Head or Coldplay or even Dave Matthews Band if your looking for talent...
B0001UL7RY|1.0|don't believe the hype,she's worst artiest of all time.she 's punk?i doubt it,even stupidest person know it.don't waste your money buy the sh*t, it's not worthy.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I would have to say Slipknot has changed but not for the worse or better. It sounded like slipknot but It seemed the heavyness in Corey went out window.I loved Duality, The BLister Exist, POTM, Welcome and ThE NaMeLeSs. But in The Blister Exist and ThE NaMeLeSs Corey Howling screams would of kicked a$$ and there was not many scatches from O. VOL. 3: (THE SUBLIMINAL VERSES) shows how much has changed for 2 years. If i could give some advice mabey they should have Rick Rubin and Ross Robinson produce them together and with both there ideas i think it could be one of the greatest albums ever but this is only advice.
B00006RU5B|5.0|hey, this cd just rocks.  i heard &quot;like a stone&quot; a few days ago, on the radio or from a friend, or somewhere, i can't recall, but in any case I really liked it.  It had a great beat and just sounded like a great song.  I tried finding out what band played it and arrived at audioslave.  so, naturally, i look up their cd to see if any of the other songs would be something i would enjoy listening to.  I noticed &quot;show me how to live,&quot; the 2nd track, right away, and had always liked the song but never knew who sang it.  That convinced me enough to go out and buy the cd.  I buy a lot of cd's, this one does not disappoint!  I enjoy the heavy rock tunes of &quot;conchise&quot; and &quot;show me how to live,&quot; and i also like how audioslave can slow it down a bit for &quot;like a stone,&quot; and especially, &quot;I am a highway.&quot;  definitely listen to either &quot;show me how to live&quot; or &quot;i am a highway&quot; to get a feel for how audioslave can sound really good as hard rockers, or slow it down for softer ballads.  I'm really glad that I made the purchase and look forward to their future efforts.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Oh my Ms. Lavigne how quickly you have matured! <br />As someone well along in their 20's I have to say that it is truly refreshing to see that the kids still have someone to look up to. Avril writes her own music, keeps her clothes on, doesn't use sex to sell her music or for that matter herself....no instead she uses her lyrics, which she writes from her own experiences. <br />Sure some of the songs on the album still have that Sk8r Boi attitude and pop (He Wasn't & Freak Out), which are very good.  <BR>But the true character of this young woman is unmasked in songs such as How Does It Feel and the overly touching Slipped Away, which was written in dedication to her late grandpa.  It is with these songs that we get to see the softer side of this talented artist and with that we connect on a personal level because we have had to deal with similar issues. <br />Ms. Lavigne keep up the good work, the music industry and let alone the youth of this country need more artists such as yourself....for that I thank you!<br />Justin
B0000508U6|1.0|I bought this after hearing part of clocks, and let me tell you, I regretted it, a lot.  The only good track is 'Don't Panic'.<br />Tiring, terrible.
B000068GA4|5.0|danzig is the man! this album is evil sounding blues metal. if you are a fan of danzig's previous punk work, stay away from this one. this is metal to the core. it is definitely one of my favorite albums ever.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Tora! Tora! Tora! is by far the better film for anyone interested in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.<BR>This film is an epic of inaccuracy and the boring love triangle is contrived and completely predictable.<BR>The viewer sighs in relief at the conclusion of the Pearl Harbour story only to realise with a growing sense of panic that there's another hour to go to cover the Doolittle raid as well.<br />Why can't Hollywood simply find and show the genuine actual drama in stories like the attack on Pearl Harbour?  This film is an insult to veterans, the US, Japan, in fact the whole world.<br />Worrying is the fact that the average rating for the film is four stars, which betrays a general lack of knowledge and taste in the reviewers.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I must say that is refreshing watching an artist mature as much as Avril Lavigne has.  It seems that she has been a very deep person, adn it is reflected in her music.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Creative outlook on a superhero with a few changes.  All the characters in this movie had great on-creen chemistry.  A great cast, a great script and a good directort are all very important to making a good story.  This movie has heart, charm, and warmth as well as gracefully sweeping aciton and hi-fi explosions. <br />Peter Parker was perfectly cast by Tobey Maguire who was able to show the angst a reserved high-school kid felt trying to fit in as a regular high schooler as well as learnign to adapt to his new powers.  Like his uncle Ben stated, &quot;With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.&quot;   Most people doubted his casting as he doesn't seem like the &quot;superhero&quot; type, but once he committed to buffing up for the part, many of us (us girls anyway) took notice and changed our minds. <br />I was at first doubtful of Kirsten Dunst's ability to pull off Mary Jane after watching her in that puffy cheerleader flick &quot;Bring it On&quot;, but she was able to bring a sweet vulnerability to a Mary Jane infatuated with Spiderman without making her seem too sappy.  A kiss is everything, and who thought of the idea of an upside down kiss in the rain? Classic and original.  <br />Wilem Defoe was a pleasant surprise as the green Goblin and switched quite easily from mangeable to madness.  Very convincing and menacing.  <br />I loved Aunt May and Uncle Ben.  They suited each other quite well.  The on-screen chemistry all around just worked.  That's what made this a great film.
B0000630YA|5.0|Omigod, it was 1974, and I went to my very first rock concert at the Orange County Pavilion or something in Southern California.  It was &quot;Welcome To My Nightmare&quot;, and I FELL IN LOVE!  Of course, I bought the album, memorized it, but somehow lost track of it many years ago.  Now, On Oct. 29th, I am going to see Alice Cooper again at the Konocti Vista Resort in Northern California. So I came aboard to find my old favorite...I can't wait to hear the tunes again!  And I am really looking forward to the extra tracks.  OOHH!  And the Concert is a costume event, so I am going to dress as Alice in Wonderland, but with Alice Cooper makeup.  I'll be Alice Cooper in Wonderland! Get It!? lol
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The date is 2003 AD: 6 guys have come together to make a new CD.  It's that time for this band named Iron Maiden: go back to the studio after thrilling 250,000 fans in Rio and make a new full power CD.  Thus, &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is concieved, CD #13.  Here is a track listing for the CD:<br />Wildest Dreams: 5/5 this is a new take for IM: less then a 4 minute song!?  WOW!<br />Rainmaker: 5/5 Ditto #1<br />No More Lies: 6/5 Totally good stuff, more classic IM.<br />Montsigur: 4/5 good enough for me!<br />Dance of Death: 5/5 a rich tradition of the title track being a standout song on the CD.  Way to go guys!<br />Gates of Tommorrow: 4/5 Yeah!<br />New Frontier: 5/5 title is misleading: good stuff!<br />Paschendale: 3/5 decent, still IM approved!<br />Face in the sand: 5/5 what haters ought to do!<br />Age of Innocence: 6/5 Truly beautiful!<br />Journeyman: 5/5 Errie yet very hard cutting track to end yet ANOTHER fab Iron Maiden CD!<br />Conclussion: Yes, Iron Maiden ARE people, and yes they CAN rockout harder then any &quot;New-Metal&quot; band today, even after 23 years of success and seeing other collueges either fallout completley or just suck.  That is an accomplishment in it's own!
0446310786|5.0|This book is SO AMAZING! It's a flawless piece of work. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Atticus is the model adult, lawyer, and father of every era, and the innocence of his young children is beautifully captured. So, if you like reading classic novels with beautiful symbolism, READ THIS BOOK!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|When Slipknot came out into the popular mainstream view after their stint on the Ozzfest tour, they raised eyebrows with their A) costumes b) sound c) blend of metal/rap/dj.  Ok...moving on- we've seen costumes- we've heard the sound...we've seen the blend. Now was a time for transcendence, which seems to be the aim with choosing Rubin as the producer. The first album, which will certainly be remembered as one of the best inital albums by any group in the last 20 years, was a fierce firestorm unleashed upon an unsuspecting world.  &quot;Iowa&quot;, their second album, sounded quite a bit, if not a complete reflection, of the first offering. In a fan base sense, the formula seemed to work- so why change it? But question this- does Fear Factory sound like &quot;Soul of A New Machine&quot;? No.  Does Messugah sound like &quot;Chaosphere&quot;?  No. Bands change their motif as they grow.  If it's evolution, then ok...it's evolution, but it doesn't neccessarily have to be. Perhaps Slipknot is now trying to satisfy their own need when it comes to making music, much like Metallica with &quot;St. Anger&quot; (which ironically was the same philosophy they used with &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;). The fans of the first two albums of Slipknot will not like this album simply because they have refused to change as the band has changed. If they want to hear the same thing, all they have to do is press repeat on their cd player while the first Slipknot or &quot;Iowa&quot; is spinning.  That is - if they are able to read the button.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|If you are a fan of Avril's and enjoyed her first album you need to get Under My Skin. The slightly heavier sound of this album makes it one of my favorites! Favorite track: Forgotten. It seemed hard for Avril to top her first album, but she did it! On a side note, Avril rocked at Webster Hall in New York Monday night! It was a great show, fairly small (around 500 people). Well worth the wait in the rain!!<br />Mike
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have been a Slipknot fan for 5 yrs. After putting out 2 heavy albums this is a nice change. The acoustic tracks are sick, The drums and guitars are heavy. The vocals are awesome as usual Corey is a great musician. Go get the album now you will be surprised....
B00005Q66T|3.0|this cd would have been the best if only it had included &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; and &quot;Fever&quot;. If I was in charge of making the cd i would eliminate &quot;Drowned World......&quot;,&quot;Frozen&quot;, and &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; the songs that i mentioned at the beginning of my writing were way bigger hits than these ones.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This CD is a great CD it has every thing you could possibly want in a metal CD.It has heavy guitars that sound great and the best drumming you will ever here.The lyrics and chores are the best.The best song is &quot;duality&quot; and &quot;the blister exists&quot; has a great drum solo.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|it seems like avril might just have more fans in the UK than in North America...most of the reviews on the US version are putting her down not one review from the UK version did...we get that youve noticed shes not punk i agree but u now what GET OVER IT she writes her own music and has alot more talent than other so called artists out there (britney) <BR>theres just one thing im wondering...why didnt they throw in the UK bonus track in the US version I3 -  I Always Get What I Want (UK bonus track) maybe she doesnt think shes such a big shot heere in America....anyways i have the UK version so who cares haha i like that song thats y i mention it...thats my 2cents
B00008J2DQ|4.0|This is the best Godsmack CD of the four.Every single song is really good and the number one song that stands out is &quot;Straight out of line&quot;.Godsmack is one of the greatest bands out there.And they put on a good show because I saw them live in 2004 with Metallica.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|The double bass drums are kicking faster and louder than ever throughout the album. There are lead guitar solos. Here's something else new, acoustic guitars can be found on Circle and Vermillion Pt. 2. Duality is a great single that sounds kind of like Left Behind, but even catchier, like Wait and Bleed. Before I forget is just as catchy, and would be my guess as to what the next single will be. Speed tracks like Welcome, Pulse of the Maggots, Opium of the People, and Three Nil, with death metal style drum sections, are highly enjoyable. I especially like track 2, The Blister Exists, with a drum fill section at the end that sounds like soldiers marching off into war. All in all, I think this album works really well. Though there are a few soft ballad type songs thrown around here and there, the entire album is just as intense as the previous two. Rick Rubin did a great production job as expected. The chili peppers, System of a Down and Slayer would agree.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Get it.  Very listenable, with much of it potential hit material.  Not the same as her first album, but suprisingly, still good, and listenable.  She has grown as a songwriter, and also did not get as much help writing these songs.  I'm glad I got it, one of the best purchases this year.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|For those who enjoy Gene's sparser, more acoustic, country-tinged work, an initial reaction to his 1974 &quot;No Other&quot; is that it is overproduced. With subsequent listening it proves itself to be a complex and richly rewarding work. Other reviewers have commented to the effect that &quot;No Other&quot; may be the epitome of the &quot;Cosmic American Music&quot; Gram Parsons hoped to create. Here the folk-rock, country-rock, singer-songwriter genres collide and then coalesce with gospel, soul, funk and even hints of 1970's progressive rock. Thomas Jefferson Kaye's ambitious production and arrangements are epic but never bombastic, occasionally busy but rarely cluttered, and they don't detract from the strong songwriting. The sound quality is excellent. This was a very well engineered album, and the CD has warmth and depth. If it is a &quot;concept&quot; album, its musical and lyrical theme is one of embodying the excesses of the era while also striving to transcend them through spirituality and a return to simplicity. This remastered and expanded version is especially valuable for its bonus tracks which include earlier alternate takes of several &quot;No Other&quot; songs, recorded with a small band in arrangements more akin to his &quot;White Light&quot; album. No matter how much you have come to like the production and arrangements of the originally released versions, these alternate takes prove that the strength of the songs did not depend on those embellishments. A lower budget &quot;No Other&quot; would have still been a great album. As I understand it, Gene Clark intended &quot;No Other&quot; to be his grand statement, and he felt deeply discouraged by its commercial failure. How sad, because &quot;No Other&quot; could easily hold its own against any other &quot;classic&quot; 1970's album. In a just and perfect world it would have been a massive seller, routinely appearing on those &quot;100 Greatest Albums&quot; lists, and would still be in heavy rotation on the &quot;classic rock&quot; stations.n on the &quot;classic rock&quot; stations.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|As soon as I heard that Avril would be releasing a new single, I immediately listened to it on AOL. It was the most realistic song I've ever heard her perform--most likely because it was a song I was finally able to relate to. I thought, &quot;Okay, if the rest of this CD is good, I'll buy it.&quot; I heard a few of her new songs on Sessions @ AOL, where she performed them acoustic. Then MTV put her on &quot;The Leak&quot; and you could listen to the full CD before it hit stores--I loved it. I'm very pleased with the songs on this album, especially since I noticed more maturity in her lyrics, as well as her voice. Her song &quot;Slipped Away&quot; brought me to tears, because everyone has lost a loved one before. I'm normally not one of her &quot;die-hard mini-Avrils,&quot; but if she starts doing more albums like this, I may one day be.
B0001L3LUE|4.0|At the current moment the United States is drawing closer to the June 30th date in which we will transfer governmental power of Iraq over to the Iraqi people, though it is expected that our troops will remain there for quite some time in order to maintain stability in the region until the new Iraqi government has gained enough experience to do things for themselves. It has been over one year since the war in Iraq began and the controversy and debate over whether we were right in our decision to take action against Saddam Hussein still looms over the minds of numerous Americans amidst the slowly increasing death toll and the over-blown prison abuse scandal. Though President George W. Bush is taking increasing pressure from presumptive Democratic nominee John Kerry for improperly handling the war effort, the Democratic Party has set it sights more recently on Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in his handling of the prison abuse scandal as well as execution of the Iraq War. So much animosity for the man has grown amongst the party that many have called for him to resign, which he and the president have refused to allow. Such hostility for the Secretary of Defense has not been seen since Robert McNamara took heat for the U.S. involvement in Vietnam, which has led to his discussion of the events of his life in the latest documentary from Errol Morris entitled, The Fog of War.    The documentary centers on the discussion with the former Secretary of Defense under both President John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson on the significant events, namely the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War, which occurred during his time in office prior to his resignation in 1967. Robert McNamara, who was born in the early 1900s around the time U.S. involvement in World War I (what Woodrow Wilson coined, ?The War to end all Wars?) was coming to a close, was lucky enough to attend the University of Berkley in the midst of the Great Depression and went on to Harvard. In his time at the Ivy League school, World War II broke out and the U.S. Air Force set up a recruitment station, in which McNamara was involved in coordinating. From there he went on to work for the Ford Motor Company and, in time, assumed the role of president, only to quit the position five weeks later in order to serve as Secretary of Defense under the Kennedy administration. Within the course of his time in office, Robert McNamara oversaw operations ranging from the Cuban Missile Crisis (1963) to the early stages of direct U.S. military involvement in the region of Vietnam and took intense scrutiny not only from the Republicans at the time but also from people within the Johnson administration as well. After his resignation from the position of Secretary of Defense in 1967, McNamara went on to serve as the president of the World Bank from 1968 to 1981 and continues to offer assistance to the federal government in numerous areas today. The documentary The Fog of War offers a view on the concepts of warfare from a man many may have misjudged all these years. Though several of McNamara?s life lessons are reasonable and easy to apply to one?s own life, there are some, namely lesson five on the proportionality of war, that are incongruous in the modern age of warfare or in any time of war. This is not to say a nation should be able to fire-bomb another nation in the midst of war without facing limits but the basis of what he is proposing doesn?t make sense in the purpose of warfare. Another prominent problem was Morris? editing style which was overly choppy; leading to many to wonder what he was leaving out and for what reason he was doing so.    Overall, The Fog of War offers some clever insights into both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations but fails in its efforts to clearly express a unified message in spite of wonderfully crafted conversations from former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. McNamara?s conversations will either leave you, depending on your political stanceand prior knowledge of history, hollering at the screen or erupting in applause. He never sticks in one fine area of politics, which, in a way, makes him all the more interesting to listen to just for the shake of his unpredictability. Unfortunately, in light of that fact, the whole documentary feels uneven as McNamara starts in one time period (1963) jumping to his childhood in 1918 back to World War II then to Vietnam then back to WWII only to return to Vietnam once again, which may leave a few viewers unfamiliar with historical dates confused. The audience also gets the feeling that McNamara may have gone a little too easy on certain individuals, namely John F. Kennedy, with whom he seemed to have been pretty close to, no more notably then in the discussion of Kennedy?s funeral plot at Arlington Cemetery. He fails to focus on Kennedy?s failure at the Bay of Pigs which results in the Cuban Missile Crisis, which he called a victory (if only in his mind), as well as his failure to adequately end any conflict in Vietnam by ordering an invasion of the North prior to the Viet Cong?s infiltration of the South. Though certain individuals are quick to assume that in light of the Iraq War that this film should reflect significantly on the decisions made thus far by the Bush administration, this documentary is to be required viewing more for the Democrats then the Republicans if only to show that their party?s past candidates did far worse then what they accuse the Bush administration of doing in the midst of the War on Terror. It should noted that those going into this film should have some prior knowledge of the historical events that take place within the context of the documentary in order to full assess and judge statements made by Robert McNamara.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril's new debut album- Under My Skin, truely reveals the REAL down-to-earth Avril, showing the teen public that she is more than just a tie and a punk rock wife-beater. She experesses her love life, the trials of life, discovering yourself, and living life to the fullest. I could definetly relate to this album on many diffrent levels, she provides a plug for every broken teen seeking energy and restoration. I love her music on this album its so refreshing and real. Job well done. Avril You definetly made a kick-a** comeback u go gurl!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|This is a good album. but i found that the first 10 songs or so are not so great being that they were remastered, the mono versions were better.  Sometimes the new is not always better than the old.  Also alot of their best is left out, like there is no tracks from Sgt. Pepper's on there!!!
B0000640VO|5.0|An uplifting, feel good love story with a message. Great acting and the camera work is incredible. This is one of those movies you could watch numerous times and never get sick of it. A definite must have for your DVD collection.
B000002U82|5.0|I was amazed after I heard this album on SACD.  The Mixing is one of the best jobs I've heard.  (Cudos to Alan Parsons) Every song went along with its era (1973) David Gilmore's voice double tracks was cool, as well as the guitar over dubs, (Money)<BR>The thing I found the most amazing was the fact that the album did not stop, the music went on with little to no pause between riffs.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I bought this slipknot cd about a minute after midnight on the day of it's release. On the drive home, I was amazed. Yes in ways the band has gone a bit softer, which is not always bad. The drum beats and bass lines are as heavy as one can possibly want. Corey's vocals have been softed a bit, as most of the songs are given a clean vocal track. As for Mick and James the guitar tracks are alot more technical. Stand out tracks such as &quot;Before I forget&quot;, &quot;Opium of the People&quot; and the first single track &quot;Duality&quot; showcase they're improved showmanship for guitar playing. <BR>Overall this is a great buy if you're into metal that has some deep meaning to it. But don't take my word for it, just listen to it and decide for yourself!
B000002BPS|2.0|Ixnay on the Hombre can be grouped along Ignition and Smash as The Offspring's absolute best. Ixnay finds band at their catchiest, with their most accessible and appealing songs in all the glory the tunes deserve. Naturally, different songs stand out to different people, but I'm sure you'll enjoy at least a few of them if you like catchy rock music in any way, shape, or form. The great thing about this record is that there's a hook in every song (unlike The Offspring's tone-deaf self-titled debut where there are nearly no solos, no &quot;whoas&quot;, and no call-and-respond choruses). After stupidly giving this gem of a CD away with other albums I had grown out of and hated hearing (die, Green Day, die), I finally heard Ixnay again for the first time since 1998. It's such a refreshing alternative to the crap that other bands (and sadly, The Offspring) are playing these days. These four guys from sunny So-Cal have severely lost their touch since Ixnay, and it is truly the last great thing the band did. Not one song on any album after Ixnay is nearly as good as what's found here. No, The Offspring didn't sell out, they wore out. But no matter how much more The Offspring continue to sink their own career, we'll still have songs like these to remember their once-greatness by:<br />1.) &quot;Gone Away&quot; (right on par with &quot;Dirty Magic&quot; in terms of beauty)<BR>2.) &quot;Amazed&quot;<BR>3.) &quot;All I Want&quot;<BR>4.) &quot;Change the World&quot; (the drum beat was taken from their own tribal-sounding song &quot;The Blurb&quot; from 1990 and used here!)
B00020HEG6|5.0|I must admit that lately Mr. Williams has been quite boring.  To be frank, the first two HP films had kind of boring music to it.  But in the Prisoner of Azkaban, John has outdone himself.  This soundtrack, in my opinion, has more emotion in it than all his other works put together.  My favorite song is &quot;Buckbeak's Flight&quot;  its just amazing.  When I first starting listening to the first couple of tracks, I had to check the cd case again and make sure that it was John Williams that wrote it!  Im really proud of John Williams with this score.  He did an excellent job on it.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Well, ima big Slipknot fan, have been since Mate, Feed.......It was a long wait for the new album to come out n ive been goin to different Slipknot websites for news on it. When i found it was comin out in late may i was happy n excited. I first song i heard was Dont Get Close, I was like wat the hell is this!!! But then i heard the single Duality n was pretty happy about it. I went n purchased the album heard it n was very surprised. This wouldve sounded great if it said Stone Sour on the album not Slipknot. i do think that Slipknot has grown up, and yes i am happy with the album. This has to be Slipknots' best work . All the songs are good in their own way. I was just a little disappointed that Slipknot has the sound of the more softer Stone Sour. Great album though.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|With such a personal album like Let Go, you'd expect Lavigne to grow on Under My Skin just as she has herself. And she has, the lyrics (although still somewhat lacking) are much deeper, heartfelt, and especially darker. <br />Most people who probably rated this album poorly is because 1) they don't like pop music, 2) they find that the album is a lot of the same generic Avril shtuff. Now as true as #2 is, you need to take this album piece by piece. Almost every song alone is great, but if you look at the album as a whole you may think differently. <br />Despite many interviews where Lavigne mentions that her music has changed. . . it hasn't, she's just perfected her original formula. She has the same kind of songs on the album.<br />1.Slower/more emotional songs:<BR>Don't Tell Me<BR>How Does It Feel<BR>Fall to Pieces<BR>Slipped Away<BR>Nobody's Home<br />2.Catchy/Fun Pop Songs<BR>He Wasn't<BR>My Happy Ending<BR>Who Knows<BR>Freak Out<br />3.Rockier/Angry songs<BR>Together<BR>Take Me Away<BR>Forgotten<br />The only two songs on the album that really didn't work out were &quot;Take Me Away&quot; and &quot;How Does It Feel.&quot; &quot;Take&quot; is too forced, and &quot;How&quot; becomes annoyingly repetitive. Otherwise the album has many great songs, especially stand out tracks &quot;Forgotten,&quot; &quot;Nobody's Home,&quot; and &quot;Slipped Away.&quot; Forgotten is a great song because of how it builds to the chorus, it starts with simple ah's to an extremely energetic and head banging chorus. &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; which is the strongest track lyrically on the album, and was co-written with former of Evanescence Ben Moody, is a powerful song with a great bridge. &quot;Slipped Away,&quot; the best track on the album, shows Avril's sad side as she sings soulfully about her Grandpa's death. <br />Another track &quot;He Wasn't&quot; is almost Sk8er Boi Part 2 with simple lyrics and a high-energy catchy chorus.<br />If you're an Avril fan, then you'll most likelylove the other tracks as well. I don't see how anybody who bought Let Go WOULDN'T enjoy this album, because it follows the same formula, but it's just better.
B000002UDB|5.0|In a recent poll taken in England as to which songs are the most requested on radio,the Beatles masterpiece &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; was in the top ten,which can be found on this album. For that alone,this album is worth buying,but in reality,the whole album is a masterpiece...oh its true!!!!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|This isn't even a good album to begin with, writing is still pretty bad, boring toned down guitars, stupid clown making<BR>and the same old, same old tired songs and plot<BR>that even bone thugs and harmony would have done<BR>Vol 3: The Subliminal Versus is ridiculous<BR>and should be called the poorliminal versus<BR>Thumbs Down for me on this album<BR>this is not a good album.
B000268QB2|2.0|You genuinely only have to look at the title of the album to know what's up here, don't you? I was introduced to Keane by the magnificent 'This Is The Last Time', a true stunner of a song, derivative perhaps but saved by a fabulously soaring chorus that you could hum for days, and maintains genuine emotional gravitas. But its almost needless to say that, like Aqualung and Haven before them, one good single doesn't imply they can last the length of an album when they're so dependent on their influences. I feel almost guilty for saying 'Coldplay', because its such an obvious and irritating comparison to make, but unfortunately you just have to. The twist of not having a guitarist is plenty original, but with this exception there's little difference.<br />Now this isn't to say 'Hopes and Fears' is a bad album. Its not as earth-shakingly awful as, say, Aqualung's second. Of course, 'Somewhere Only We Know', actually the bigger hit, is fairly pleasent and nice-sounding, though it could never match up to 'This Is The Last Time'. And nothing here is essentially bad. What many of the tracks are, is faceless. Despite pulling out strong melodies on almost every track (much to their credit), they can feel like they fell out of the 'rent-a-soaring-melody' machine.<br />Because, let's face it, a catchy tune isn't enough. Steps had catchy tunes; Aqua had catchy tunes, but you wouldn't listen to them if someone paid you. No: you need something more. You need some sort of edge or originality. 'Hopes and Fears' is fairly cannily produced, too, Tom Chaplin's voice is melodious and slightly cracked: its all here. Everything except something to distinguish them from the many decent bands with a way with a tune like them: to prove they're more than just pleasent fooder but an object of passion and love. This they haven't yet done. You could do much worse, but on the other hand, you could do much better.
078681859X|2.0|I was excited by the premise of this book but I must give it a bad rating since nothing really happens in it. Having a djinni serve a young magician is a great idea but the author does nothing with it. The djinni does nothing exciting with his powers and the young boy magician is a snivelling bore. It seems many are trying to write the new \\"Harry Potter.\\" Many are trying and many are failing...but they're getting published anyway. A total mystery to me. So, avoid this book and look for your young adult fantasy elsewhere.
B00004TDTO|5.0|You may ask me why I am writing a review on a movie that's been made in the mid70's?  Because it is a great action film!  I read one reviewer say that it is on the tv all the time and that people should get a life?  Have you thought that there is a reason that it is on all the time?  The fact that it is on all the time should not be the reason to give it a bad review.  This movie set the standard for the summer blockbuster, in fact, it created the summer blockbuster event.  Make no mistake, this is an action/thriller, but it has a lot of humor in it and the characters grow, evolved tthroughout the movie and you get to feel for them.  You see Martin Brody go from being dominated by the mayor and suffering the consequences to demanding to resolve it his way.  <br />Spielberg keeps the shark hidden until near the end portion of the movie.  Up to that point, all you see is hints and clues of its presence.  If it was being made today,  They would show the shark all the time.  See 'Deep Blue Sea' for example.  <br />Get it!  By all means, buy for your dvd library!
0345457684|5.0|This was a great story, no doubt about it. It's the 25th Century, and amongst all the technology that now exists, the most radical is that which allows people to store their personas digitally on surgically implanted cortical stacks, and move to another body should death occur. Thus, it's very difficult to die a final death, and the ability to transmit one's persona between solar systems at the speed of light and arrive to be loaded (&quot;resleeved&quot;) into a cloned body has revolutionized interstellar travel.<br />The backdrop is astonishing, and amidst the adventures of mercenary Takeshi Kovacs, we explore every implication of the new technology: Do people ever die? Can a human persona inhabit a computer? Can you make copies of yourself? Can computer viruses infect your cortical stack? What implications does near-immortality have on religion?<br />Very good book. I'll recommend it to anyone.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Every once in a good while, the impact of a particular entertainment format is wholly contingent upon the emotional tapestry the viewer/listener brings to it.<br /><br />This is a classic example.<br /><br />In one of the most un-Burtoneque projects to come from Tim Burton, \\"Big Fish\\" is a mesmerizing fairy tale wonderfully reminicsent of the underrated \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" more than a decade ago.  Depending upon where you are emotionally, this can be not only a satisfying viewing experience but an equally thought-provoking one that, chances are, will leave an indelible impression.<br /><br />This time around Tim Burton abandons his usually dark fare for the southern tall tale.  He brilliantly brings to realization this regional cultural phenomenom with aplomb and moreover, with no condescension whatsoever for a very important art form.  As a southerner, I was quite pleased with the respect granted to an age-old southern tradition that shows us the consequences of not being able to see the forest for the trees.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the story follows a son's last attempts to discover who his father really is as the son insists that during his upbringing, his father has hidden his true self behind his tall tales.  The son and the father have their final confrontation on the father's deathbed and it is here the son finally realizes the time he has wasted because of his \\"inability to see for looking.\\"<br /><br />Albert Finney is simply captivating.  I have never seen him in a southern role and he was just wonderful as were the supporting cast.  While the brooding son, Billy Crudup, was most effective, this was indeed Finney's moment and proved to be a fitting vehicle for his remarkable talents.  Ewan McGregor personfies charm as the young Edward Bloom.<br /><br />This is a wonderful dissertaion on the intricate, intimate, and often complex father-son relationship.  It is also a wonderful movie for families to share together.<br /><br />Visually, Burton put his stamp on it as he helped to realize Edward Bloom's (Finney) tall tales as the special effects were dazzling and wonderful in helping the audience to see very well the kind of man Edward Bloom was.  While the end of the movie was somehwat melancholy, it was right on target and did not descend into maudlin sentimentality - it proved to be the natural order of events.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as you will enjoy viewing this one over and over again.  I have never been more pleased with a DVD purchase than I have with this one and suspect already as I write this review that it is steadily becoming one of my all time favorites, not only for its entertainment value but more so because of the valuable insight it provided into my own situation.nney) tall tales as the special effects were dazzling and wonderful in helping the audience to see very well the kind of man Edward Bloom was.

B000000WF0|5.0|Too bad Verve are no longer together.  At least they were able to release something as monumental as &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; before they disbanded.  Packed here is a collection of rockers and ballads that transcend the Rock/Indie genre.  &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; is pure brilliance and one of the most recognizable songs of all-time.  &quot;The Rolling People&quot; and &quot;Catching the Butterfly&quot; are trippy, instrument driven mid-tempo rockers with simple but effective lyrics.  The trio of &quot;Space and Time&quot;, &quot;Weeping Willow&quot;, and ubrballad &quot;Lucky Man&quot; round out a solid middle, and &quot;Come On&quot; is a rousing end to a great album.  &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; is one of the 90's essentials, and Richard Ashcroft greatest musical collaboration.  Highly recommended.

0446677450|1.0|I can't believe this book is a bestseller. That was the underlying reason for me to buy this book in the first place but what a disappointment!!!! If anyone reading my review and thinking of buying this book, let me summarize the content of this book in one sentence. BUY BUSINESSES!!! That's it. <BR>There is nothing more in this book than common sense financial advice that we have all heard before. \\"If you want to become wealthy, you have to own your own business\\". The funny thing is that Mr. Kiyosaki doesn't even tell you on how you can achieve owning your own business.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The story of John Nash--a brilliant man suffering from disorganized and paranoid thoughts--raises the issue of whether brilliant thoughts and ideas are typically created from those who are, well, a bit insane.  In my own experience, I've seen that those who are quite creative tend to have many quirky personality attributes, some of which would be defined as 'disorders' by pyschologists.  The movie certainly gives the impression that without his schitophrenia, Mr. Nash would not have been able to see the world the way it actually is, especially regarding his scientific theories.  If that's true, it certainly is an interesting subject for future scientists to explore.<br />But I did love the movie.  The acting was quite strong. . . I like the fact that the movie was able to present the 'invisible characters' in Mr. Nash's life in the beginning of the film without openly telling the audience that these individuals don't exist in reality.  That is left for the audience to discover later.  We are as fooled as Mr. Nash is.  That's the point.
B00009TB5G|5.0|First off don't believe ANYONE who says WalMart won't give you your money back.  Walmart will refund a peice of chewed gum, they are probably on of the best companies about that hands down.  If the edition doesn't play on your machine, it's probably YOUR machine, not the discs.  This edition is CHOKED full of special footage, extended scenes actually added back in the film(not seperate like most editions), and awesome packaging.  If you love these movies don't miss out on the TRUE directors vision and extended scenes.  WAAAAAY to much to talk about, just buy it already!!
B00000K19E|1.0|This movie is one big dull bunny of a tale.  Neo has nothing going in him at all and as the series developed he got worse.  He is as flatsouled and as empty as a house abandoned even by the demons and the ghosts.  His fall for Morpheus demonstrates the gullibility and even narcisitic death urges that lurk in his puerile soul.  Only a death urge and an extreme infatuation with himself, covertly needin g massive doses of ego-stroking could possibly explain how he fell for that equally shallow, utterly pretentious snake-oil salesman Morpheus.  I feel terribly bad for Lawrence Fishburn who is a tremendous actor, capable of roles more complex and interesting that the mono-maniacal con-man strait jacket he allowed himself to get pressed into.  Neo is the Messiah?  I prefer the scruffy, complicated, firey man from Nazareth.  This movie has been praised as innovative by people who are ignorant of the fact that all of its best ideas were stolen and mutilated from more competent science fiction writers.  How about the spirituality of the Matrix?  Millions of other-wize decent people have almost worshipped this film - as if it were a Revelation from the spiritual world.  I find the &quot;spirituality&quot; of this film to be cheap.  It lacks all of the complexity, difficulty, and traumas of real spirituality.  Spirituality is a world of tiny deeds unnoticed, momentary ecstasys, deep sadness, joys that cannot be comphrehended, momentary brawls with the spirits, midnight fist fights with God, beauty, and service.  The spirituality of this film is pure, self-congratulatory violence.  It is yet another Rambo-as-Frankenstein's monster film that seems to gratify American audiences who cannot get enough of killing in the name of God.  Don't buy it.  Don't waste the money.  You'll regret it. Go out and do something good for yourself and the people you love.
B000060MMI|5.0|Everything about this CD rocks from track1-track12 it's one of the best CDs I have.
B00005JLT5|5.0|For the record, let me comment on Dennis Littrell on his same review of this film. I find his opening statement repulsive, as he used the persecution of Jews during WW II as an excuse to justify Zionist persecution against the Palestinians here. Littrell is solely wrong if he thinks The Pianist is a film of Jewish supremacy overcoming all odds. Adrian Brody commented that in Szpilman's book (which this film is based), he narrates his experiences in an objective view. There were not just evil Nazis running around persecuting Poles and Jews, but there good Poles and bad Poles, good Jews and bad Jews and even good Germans among Nazi ranks. Even Polanski allows this in his film, where poor and suffering Jews complain of rich and influential Jews doing nothing to allevate their suffering. You can see the extreme contrast of rich and poor gap where you see the Jews in the restaurant where Szpilman plays the piano and the streets where you can see corpses lying on street, victims of starvation.<br />In the beginning of the film, the Germans have invaded Poland and the Szpilman family are adjusting their lives to the new ruling of the Nazi Germans. They find their living conditions deteriorate as they are hustled away from their comfortable home to Ghetto and finally to the \\"melting pot\\". We see two brothers conflicting with each other as Hendrik,  Szpilman's brother did not like the way he supposedly grovel to the authorities and using his privilage as a famous pianist which many Jews may envy. Even Hendrik was ungrateful when his brother freed him from prison. \\"Are you mad?\\" Szpilman asked. Hendrik's reply was \\"That is also my business.\\"<br />Szpilman's influence was so great that he was spared when his family was sent off to the gas chambers. He lost every one of his family and when he goes back to the Ghetto where virtually all Jews were wiped out, here is a man completely devastated. We see the second half of the movie being akin to The Fugitive where he wriggles awayfrom the claws of ever-suspecting Nazis. <br />When caught by Captain Wilm Hosenfeld and asked to play the piano, he plays the piano for the first time in a few years he had to be in silence for fear of alerting those around him (in apartment where he lives, he cannot play the piano as to alert everybody around him that there is a hiding Jew). This is one of the most redemptive scenes in the history of film, Szpilman plays the Chopin's Ballade reflecting the ordeal he went through. It is akin to Furtwangler conducting the great Beethoven Ninth in 1942 with battlefield sounds heard from distant.<br />At this age, where we cannot foretell the conclusion to the Middle East conflict and Americans squandering up their operation in Iraq, the pathetic music of MTV is contrary to music in Szpilman's time. Great music can only be created with great suffering. Gustav Mahler said that if his life flows like a calm meadow, he would not have the ability to compose anything. The classical music age has lost it's Szpilmans, Furtwanglers, Menuhins and the like. When another horrific World War comes, will there be another artist like Szpilman? Time can only tell.
076790592X|5.0|In the beginning, I thought that this would be another typical teacher recommendation type of book. But because of the positive comments I got about it, I decided to try it. Soon, I began to get into the story, the sadness of the disease, and I began to feel sorry for Morrie. However, as the plot showed me hidden lines written in between the sentences, I began to see not the sorrow, but the joy in every chapter. When Morrie could no longer get out of bed, I felt devastated because I had gotten to &quot;know&quot; Morrie through the book. It really showed me that in this capitalistic world that we live in, it is possible for someone that seems to have handicaps to show you the way out of them. In conclusion, I think that this book is one of the few that touched all the feelings hidden within a person.
B000002L82|5.0|this is one of my  favorite albums of all time. (look in my \\"so you'd like to...\\" lists to see what accompanies it if you want to). I'll tell you what about 1/2 of the other reviews already have, and that is that the original album didn't include \\"blue monday\\" or \\"the beach\\". it's true that the album does flow together more smoothly without them, but they aren't entirely unwelcome (though the last song really SHOULD be \\"leave me alone\\"; it's like adding something on after \\"some girls are bigger than others\\", know what i mean?) this is very moving music that never, ever feels smarmy. it's cold and detached while being warm and involving. i know that sounds impossable, but it's true. ok, yeah, as previously indicated, \\"age of consent\\", \\"the village\\", \\"your silent face\\", and \\"leave me alone\\" really are the best songs on the album, but the others aren't bad songs at all, it's just that these songs are so superb. these songs are all etheral stunners, and this album was the first masterpiece of the new genre.
0792839730|5.0|- History -<br />Operation Market-Garden, begun in September 1944, was an Allied military campaign led by Montgomery, the senior British field commander, in the latter stages of World War II.  While the Allies were still in France, a plan had to be formulated for making the major push into German territory, a difficult task, considering the Rhine River (one of the major rivers of the world) provided a natural defensive border with the majority of the German homeland.  Planning offensive operations required taking this into account, and how the forces would cross the river and remain safe while doing so, rather than have bottlenecks that would make the forces easy targets.<br />While Patton was in the south, pushing through France on the backside of the old Maginot line, Montgomery hit upon an idea to seize a series of bridges across the various rivers that made up the geography of the Low Countries, all the way up to Arnhem, one of the northern-most major bridges across the Rhine, a bridge outside of German territory, but a good jumping-off point for invading northern Germany.  His plan won approval, and in one of the largest military operations of the war, a major push was developed to secure the bridges.  This had the largest airborne component of any battle in the war, as troops were airlifted and dropped into position around each bridge, charged to hold the bridges until ground forces pushed northward linking up logistic and defensive lines toward each spot.<br />Operation Market-Garden was actually two operations -Market was the airborne component; Garden was the ground component.  It was meant to take the Germans by surprise (which it did) and exploit their disorganisation (which was, sadly for the Allies, not as severe as intelligence predicted).  The Allies were stopped short of their primary military objectives (securing an 80-mile corridor of bridges) by some 25-30 miles.  Hence the name of the film, derived from the book by Cornelius Ryan, `A Bridge Too Far'.<br />- Film -<br />Cornelius Ryan's book was adapted for the screen by writer William Goldman and director Richard Attenborough, a leading director of British cinema, noted for such diverse films as Gandhi (for which he won an Oscar), A Chorus Line, Cry Freedom, and Shadowlands.  Attenborough was nominated for a BAFTA directing award for `A Bridge Too Far' in 1978.  Attenborough is also well-known in front of the camera, too.<br />Attenborough brought together a monumental cast for this epic film, worthy of Cecil B. DeMille in scope and size.  At just under three hours in length, it is as unrelenting as the combat scenes it depicts.  While not matching the graphic realism of films such as `Saving Private Ryan', it nonetheless does a good job at combining a look at grand strategies (from formation to failure), tactical maneuvers, and individual combat situations.  The high command in Britain, hoping to capitalise on the continuing disorder in Germany arising from their adjustment to fighting a losing war on two fronts (three, in fact, if one includes Italy), saw the opportunity to strike.  Through a series of misfires and misunderstandings, they end up fighting not local police forces (the Netherlands had been spared intense battleground warfare for most of the war, and thus was thought to not contain any real combat-strength troops) but crack Panzer division placed there, essentially on a rest stop before being deployed in more critical areas.<br />The planning and preparations are realistic, from a look at the intelligence gathering and analysis (these were the days before satellite imagery), the gathering together of equipment and personnel, the execution of the operations, and the demoralising realisation that Operation Market-Garden is not going well.  One of the most outstanding scenes involves General Stanislaw Sosabowski (played by Gene Hackman) discussing the operation with his superiors - Sosabowski, a general of the Polish forces in exile in England,distrusts the operation, for good reason, but acquiesces to support the plan.  His uneasiness is palpable.<br />The cinematography is terrific, considering it was done largely without `trick' shots - no helicopter shots, no CGI graphics, no slow motion or composite tricks.  The airborne drops are breathtaking, giving the thrill and the danger a realistic tone.  The film does not depict glider landings (some of the most dangerous types of drops, and presumably because of this danger, omitted from the filming).  The desperation of the men who land without their equipment (or miss the airdrops later due to failed communications) is easily felt - the sense of the waste of war is driven home when one soldier sprints to get some desperately needed supplies that have fallen just outside of the secure zone - being shot by a sniper, the sense of futility is underscored by the breeze blowing soldiers' caps (which was the contents of the supplies for which the soldier paid with his life) drifting away.<br />The acting is stunning in many instances, but for the most part it is the usual good job rather than outstanding that one might hope for from such an elite group of actors.  The music is memorable and appropriate.  One drawback is that the editing of the film makes it a bit confusing to keep the various storylines going, particularly if one has studied the sequence of events in World War II history, which, while followed as a pattern, is not adhered to with rigour in the filming.<br />- Conclusions -<br />Operation Market-Garden was conceived as a plan to get the troops `home for Christmas', hoping to secure a passage into Germany prior to the winter, to force them into surrender.  As history would have it, there were major battles to fight before the war would finish the following summer.  This film captures a significant campaign in good format, showing the operational and human aspects in a high relief.distrusts the operation, for good reason, but acquiesces to support the plan.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|After releasing a very solid, and greatly received debut, the band went to work on their second album, simply titled &quot;Iowa&quot;. By then, the fanbase began to seperate into to seperate groups: The fans who loved &quot;Iowa&quot;, and the fans who lost alot of faith in the band due to it. I personally was not a big fan of Iowa and I thought they just lost it. But there was a light at the end of the tunnel... on May 25th, 2004, my faith in Slipknot was restored and I once again could be a proud fan of this band.<br />Alot of people will call this their &quot;Sellout&quot; album, or their swan song. I feel that calling it their masterpiece is simply not doing it justice. &quot;Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses&quot; is packed full of what made Slipknot break into the masses in the first place. Songs like &quot;The Blister Exists&quot;, &quot;the first single &quot;Duality&quot; and &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot; are prime examples of just that. But this album also reveals a side of the band that some never would have expected. Songs such as &quot;Circle&quot; and &quot;Vermilion Pt. 1 &amp; 2&quot; show what great songwriters the band really are and how they can let their sound evolve to do more than just metal.<br />In the end, I feel this album is their best work to date. It shows a band that is in top form in everyway, making some of the catchiest metal i've ever heard - while still preserving the sound which made them in the first place. Call them &quot;Sellouts&quot; if you'd like, but you cannot deny that they are back and here to stay!
B0000027RL|3.0|I've been a Pearl jam fan since i heard alive on the radio 13 years ago (i think) and i really consider Pearl Jam an excellent band, and Ten is an icon, but still i cant listen to the record all over without skiping songs, this album is great but its not perfect because a couple of songs, oceans and once, are really long and boring, but songs like even flow, jeremy, black, and alive kinda make it up for them, anyway this is not grunge.. pearl jam is no grunge band...whcih does not make them bad a t all, this record is too polished i guess, it sounds too clean for grunge.<BR>but it's a must for any good rock fan anyway, although i'd recomend Vitalogy first, its much better than ten
B000002HH9|3.0|This is a very interesting album. I read/heard alot of negative feedback concerning this album. But, true Cure fans can respect it for what it is. And like it or not, no one can say anything bad about Robert's awesome ability as a songwriter. He's a musical genius! <br />As far as liking it or disliking it goes, I say &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. I go back and forth. Sometimes I'll listen to it and think: WOW! Robert you've really out done yourself this time! Then, I'll listen to it another time and think: Robert, even though you blew it, you're still alright in my book! <br />Of all the Cure albums (and I own them all!), this is my least favorite. But still, it yielded some good things. Notibly &quot;This Is A Lie&quot;, &quot;Jupiter Crash&quot;, and &quot;Want&quot;. <br />A must have for all &quot;TRUE&quot; Cure fans.
B000003TAR|4.0|This album is probably not as easy to listen to as Nevermind, but i do think its brilliant, Nevermind might be better as a record but this one has better tracks on it, is just that very few of them are a little bit too raw for most ears, anyway this is an excellent record it features the band in both, their soft side (in dumb, all apologies, pennyroyal tea) and in it's most hard pieces ( in tourettes, scentless apprentice, and very ape)<BR> Nirvana was a ground-breaking band, and so was their last record, maybe not as popular as Nevermind but more Nirvana style i'd say, after all Nirvana's target was never to hit that big wasnt' it? get this record and give it a second or even a third shot if you dont get it right away, it takes time but is worth it
B00005NTJM|4.0|When I first discovered Jethro Tull about 20 years ago, I began to buy anything and everything I could get my hands on that the band put out. But I always heard two things regarding Tull, buy &quot;Passion Play&quot; but only after you have developed a serious ear for Tull, and &quot;This Was&quot; was not really a Tull album because it sounded so different from everything else they have done. On &quot;Passion Play&quot; I would agree, I wouldn't make getting that disk a priority, but I have to say &quot;This Was&quot; was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed this debut album even if it was slightly different from the rest of Tull catalog. But there are some true Tull classics here, &quot;My Sunday Feeling&quot; and &quot;Song for Jeffrey&quot; are still played in concert today by the current Tull line up. Mick's bluesy guitar work is phenominal, (If you haven't picked up Bloodwyn Pig's A Head Rings Out CD Do So!) and culminates in the fantastic, rocking &quot;Cat's Squirrel&quot; instrumental. Ian Anderson plays a really mean flute on &quot;This Was&quot; as well. Overall, I would say if you are a fan of Tull you have to own &quot;This Was&quot; if for no other reason than to hear how the band sounded at it's beginning. &quot;This Was&quot; is a great foundation for one of the best bands of all time.
0671027344|2.0|Where to begin...  I think what happened here is that Chbosky wrote a great book.  And then MTV stepped in (yes, this is a &quot;MTV Books&quot; book) and mandated that this be more marketable to high school kids.  The main problem I had with this book was a matter of believablity.  The main character's (charlie) best friend commits suicide before he starts high school, and for whatever, any other friends are gone now too.  So you have a kid, going into high school, and he has no friends.  Somehow, he manages to meet two people, become best friends with them, and then in turn become best friends with thier friends.  No high school on earth works like that.  Another key point that I found very insulting and disturbing is when Charlie's sister has an abortion, and there is absolutely no physical or mental recourse.  She sleeps for 5 hours in the back of a car, goes home, eats dinner, and life is normal again.  Thats not how it works.  Any woman that has had an abortion will tell you that you are mentally a mess afterwards.  This portrayal is about 1,000 times worse when you consider that the target audience here is high school kids.  Also, the fact that Charlie cries on nearly every page, gets particularly annoying after the first 20 times.  I now understand why emo kids love this book.  <br />As my title states: Don't buy this book.  Instead, read one of the books mentioned within this book.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|I have liked Slipknot from the begining, and loved them because of their true metal sound. They never let up. To me their first 2 cds were amazing. But this cd has changed.  First, his voice seems to have blown out. It sounds like its harder for him to screem. He has to screem higher and he cant keep it for long before he looses it, mixing yell/talking with screeming. Second, the lyrics arn't as bad ass as the old ones  \\"fill your lungs until you caugh\\" thats kind of stupid.The cd is filled with lyrics like that. And third, there are soft songs on it. Don't get me wrong, i like soft songs. My music variety is braud. But i would have never thought that slipknot would have done that. Personaly I dont like it. I listen to them when i want something heavy, (...). But the music itself is brutal. It goes somewhere i didnt think slipknot could go. All in all i liked the cd. But i like it much better when i just listen to it and not think that Slipknot made it.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I'm going to be honest here because I haven't been a Slipknot fan since I graduated from high school. That is when they let out their self-titled debut and everyone went out and bought those stupid jumpsuits and painted there nails black and all that other stupid poser crap. That particular album displayed alot of aggression and demented and twisted songs.This one shows that they are progressing with their style and overall is a good effort but it still seems to me that they are lacking a bit. The riffs are okay and the drum work is amazing but, it seems like they really don't have anything to write about. The lyrics are weak and seem thrown together in order to shut their fans up, which has been a constant problem for this band since Iowa(which is a piece of crap album) was released. What they really need to do is sit down and remember what made their first album so great and stop writing mediocre material. Okay cd But not good or great
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Wow! I cant believe Slipknots back with a raging new album, with a way different sound. Slipknot used to be a hard, death metal band, but in there new album they slowed donw a little bit. I think this was a great change! I think this is a break-through in metal history!I completely new sound! Any rock fan, from AcDc to Murderdolls will love this cd!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Wow!  What a great album.  SlipKnot have really come together and amazed fans and Maggots, such as myself, with their new sound.  They have gotten a bit soft, but it's new and it's going to take some time to get used to.  The only complaint i have of them, is that they did too much of the acoustics on it, making them sound like Stone Sour, but the album is still worth buying, no matter what.  I really enjoyed this album, but didn't really care for the acoustics, even though it sounds good.  But thus far, Slipknot, keep up the fantastic work.
B0000C7PRY|1.0|I've been a huge fan of Spock's Beard and Transatlantic for years, but...<br />This disc should be titled &quot;Cringe&quot;.  While there are some great little instrumental parts here and there, the lyrics are quite possibly the cheeziest I've ever heard.  IMHO, Neil's never been the greatest with lyrics (&quot;some people are like gravy...&quot;), but this is just awful.  It's a 123 minute series of cringe-inducing cliches.  It sounds very forced and unnatural.  The vocal performance and the song-oriented musical parts don't help much, and Portnoy's performance is by far his most bland.<br />Unless you are afflicted with a blind love of all things Christian, I'd pass on this one.

0060920084|1.0|As a reader from the much maligned town of Carbondale, Il., I feel compelled to set the record straight.  Bryson's account of his brief visit to my hometown is simply not true.  (Bill- you can't buy beer in convenience stores in Carbondale.  I know.  My family has been in the liquor business for almost 40 years.)  If ONE of his accounts is embellished, or, more accurately, a LIE, how can a reader believe anything written here?  Go ahead...make up moderately entertaining, if negative and patronizing, tales about travels in America.  But be sure to file them under Fiction.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This CD is soooo great!  I love every song on it.  My personal favorites are The Blister Exists, Duality, Vermillion, Pulse Of The Maggots, and Vermillion pt. 2.  But I like all the songs!  Definately a must have for music lovers!!!
B000002GFC|5.0|My first introduction to Cream was a song on the classic rock station called &quot;Crossroads&quot; and I loved the way Clapton and Bruce played the lead gitar/bass duo-melodies in the instrumental part, kind of like Yes did in &quot;Then&quot;.  Although I am not a fan of blues, I do like a beat and most of thier songs have a beat that sets them apart from blues.  This collection spans thier 66-69 carear together(I was born only a year after thier last song was published in 1969 so I missed 'em.).  Songs like &quot;I'm so Glad&quot;, &quot;I feel Free&quot; Where Ginger Baker played his melodic drum kit, and the haunting &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; as well as the ever classic hit &quot;White room&quot; and of course &quot;Crossroads&quot; are my favorite songs and easily stick in my mind enough for me to play the CD once more.  Yes, this band can be compared to blues, but if you like classic rock I promise you'll love this!
B00003CX95|3.0|Braveheart comes with an impressive list of credentials.  It is regarded as one of Mel Gibson's best performances.  It won five Academy Awarts, including Best Picture.  The musical score by James Horner is one of the all time favorites.  And it is one of the most popular movies of all time.  Billed as an epic historical saga filled with history, love and battle, Braveheart apparently is Hollywood at its best.  But is it really worth all the hype, and is the emperor really wearing any clothes?<br />First of all, the movie takes many historical liberties, deviating substantially from the real account of William Wallace.  For instance, both the \\"prima nocta\\" legislation, and the suggestion that Wallace fathered a child with Princess Isobelle are fictional.  But poetic license in movie making is not new, and can hardly be sufficient reason for trashing a movie - Braveheart never pretends to be a reconstruction of history.  But it does pretend to be an epic of cinema, and its success in that regard is debatable.<br />The basic plot of Braveheart is quite simple:  Man loves woman.  Woman gets killed by English.  Man gets angry and takes revenge on English killers of woman.  Man helps lead Scotland to freedom from English. Notice something?  While William Wallace is lauded for his efforts to free Scotland, the reality is that he is motivated more by personal revenge and anger over what happened to his wife. His character is ruled more by murderous passion, lust and revenge, than by politics; His actions are more the result of uncontrollable rage than the result of an intelligent desire to liberate his country.  In the process, Wallace stoops to commit some of the same evils as his English oppressors.  Just like the English tried to take his wife, so Wallace ends up bedding the wife of the English crown prince, rather than honoring her marriage to her own husband (who is admittedly a fool, but this doesn't justify adultery).  In principle, Wallace's adultery is just as heinous and dishonoring to her husband as the English's treatment of Wallace's wife dishonored him. But by this point most viewers have already been manipulated to think that this sexual conquest is a good thing; Braveheart clearly presents this adulterous tryst as a delightful thing, and even rewards the adulterous union with a child.<br />This is typical of the moral confusion evident throughout the entire movie.  While it pretends to be an epic about a struggle for freedom, in reality it is little more than a gory action movie with lots of fighting and passion, where the action is governed more by primitive and barbarian feelings and lusts than by reasoned and thoughtful intelligence.  The reasons behind the cry \\"Freedom!\\" are never explained, aside from the fact that Wallace is filled with rage at losing his wife, and this motivates him to fearless (and at times foolish and unbelievable) acts of \\"bravery\\".  He's a larger-than-life hero governed by passion without reason; is motivated more by a vengeful passion over his murdered bride than a passion for his country.  It's not surprising that Braveheart is nonetheless popular, because perhaps the masses today are largely governed by the same passions.  This kind of hero is appealing to those accustomed to the ongoing media spectacle which lauds mindless macho men, and brainless brawn.  Despite our advanced technological and educated era, popular culture is largely rendered passive and mindless through the influence of the mass media and thoughtless entertainment.  Perhaps then it's little wonder that we find Braveheart so appealing, that we fail to realize that its attraction is no more enduring than the emperor's new clothes.  And that today we find a more intelligent movie about a principled statesman and leader like \\"A Man For All Seasons\\" rather boring.<br />Not to say that Braveheart is all bad (although be warned that the violence and gore more than justifies the R rating).  I found it appealing that the movie didn't resort to a feel-good everyone-lived-happily-ever-after type ending.  The final tragic note is powerful, and is not altogether unlike its imitator \\"Gladiator\\" (2000).  The battle scenes featuring medieval weapons and hundreds of extras create an epic feel, and have to be admired for what they are - although at times the drama is exaggerated.  But when all is said and done, this movie pretends to be more than what it really is. Braveheart turns history into a blood and brainless love story.  It's no more one of the heights of cinema than the Emperor's new clothes are the heights of fashion. - GODLY GADFLYidn't resort to a feel-good everyone-lived-happily-ever-after type ending.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|This past weekend I had the pleasure of seeing one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I am speaking of Ever After starring Drew Barrymore and Angelica Huston.  This is a Cinderella story with a bit of a twist.<br />The film opens with an ageing Princess being visited by to two gentlemen who turn out to be the Brothers Grimm.  She compliments them on their work and mentions her fascination with the tale of the little cinder girl.  While the brothers joke about pumpkins and fairy godmothers the princess reveals the glass slipper and offers to tell them the true tale.<br />Danielle gains a step-mother and two step-sisters when her father marries a Countess.  Soon she runs into the Prince.  She thinks he is a thief and pelts him with apples.  When she realizes her mistake she offers up her life.  But the Prince in on the run so he rewards her with gold.  Danielle uses the gold to buy back the husband of one of the servants.  But to do so she must impersonate a courtier and runs into the Prince again.  She manages to sneak away but only after giving her mother's name as her own.<br />The stage is now set.  The Prince does not want to marry the Spanish Princess his father has arranged for and seeks out Danielle.  Under the pretense that she is a courtier they spend time together and a romance blossoms.  The Prince is all set to announce his engagement (made at midnight at a ball) to Danielle but her step-mother reveals her base heritage and the Prince becomes angry.  But in the end everything works out and the scene returns to the Brothers Grimm and Danielle's great-granddaughter.<br />There are no elements of the fantastic in this tale.  No magic of fairies.  Instead an attempt is made to place the tale firmly into history.  The story is set in France in the Sixteenth century with the Prince being the Crown Prince of France.  A little more cement is added in the form of Leonardo Da.. Vinci who has arrived to be the Royal Artist.  Could this be during the two-year gap in Leonardo's history?  I don't know.  I do know that the movie is filled with humor, adventure and romance and stars a Cinderella who is a bit more competent than other renditions.<br />Angelica Huston is perfect as the step-mother.  She really has the knack of being totally evil and proper at the same time.  My only problem with the film was that the younger step-sister resembled Drew Barrymore a little too much.  But that is a very minor point and hardly detracts from the film.  I whole-heartedly recommend this film to anyone who likes a bit of fun, adventure, romance or any combination of the three.

B00000G3PA|3.0|After watching Armageddon I am sort of reminded of the release of The Arrival and Independence Day where both movies dealt with a similar plot and one tried to be somewhat realistic while the other went the campy B route.  The same can be said of Deep Impact and Armageddon.  Like Independence Day, Armageddon is a big budget B movie.  Also like Independence Day, it is a lot of fun.<br />In this movie an unseen comet slams into the Asteroid Belt and sends a bunch of rocks toward Earth.  A brief, but very destructive, meteor shower precedes the main event that will be played by an asteroid the size of Texas.  In the eighteen days that Earth has left a team of the world's fines oil drillers is assembled and sent into space to plant a nuke to blow up the asteroid.  A simple plot.<br />During the course of the movie we realize that the writers no nothing about Oil drilling, oil companies, astronomy, NASA, gravity, or most any other topic raised in the movie.  There are a number of things I found particularly amusing.  The first was the rough-neck driller (Bruce Willis) who is also the owner of the Drilling Company and drilling rig and is also a multi-millionaire.  The rest of the drillers also seem to earn far more that their real-life counterparts.  I was also amused at the fact that with all life on Earth being threatened, including bacteria, that the President of the United States has the authority to scrap the mission to save the world (there are at least five countries directly involved in the operation).<br />Among some of the other amusing points are the space shuttles (with a metal skin and not ceramic tiles) have the maneuverability of an F-14 Tomcat.  They do some wonderful daredevil flying that is a credit to Top Gun (and without atmosphere yet).  The asteroid, which resembles a giant black snowflake, has some gravity.  There is enough that people don't move any differently than on Earth but little enough that a jump can carry you for miles or break out of thegravity well.  Then there is the aging space station that blows up.  Although the fuel is in a pod at the end of a long extension, there seems to be highly explosive material in every inch of the station.  The first meteor that hits lands next to a guy arguing with another guy.  The other guy is struck dead (no pun intended) and resulting in a hole that goes through to the subway system but leaves the first guy just a little dusty.<br />While Armageddon is a B movie it does have elements of other classic films including The Right Stuff.  I also liked the pro NASA and pro Space Program plugs that keep popping up (Thornton is excellent).  This is a fun movie but the plot and continuity have more holes than the average storm-door screen.  If you want a fun movie, this is the one to watch, if you want something a bit more serious, check out Deep Impact instead.

B00000ILBK|4.0|The rule of odds and evens continues to apply in Star Trek Insurrection.  Being the second true Next Generation film it is a must-see for fans.<br />The film opens with scenes on a tranquil, agricultural planet.  Then things heat up as we run into Data and some Federation personnel.  It seems they are observing the tranquil society in what is called Operation Duck Blind (the inhabitants don't know they are being looked at).  From there we run into the rest of the main cast and the plot begins to develop.  It involves a malfunction Data experiences while assisting at Operation Duck Blind that results in the mission being compromised.<br />As the crew of the Enterprise investigate what went wrong with Data they begin to raise more and more questions.  As the main plot is revealed the crew must band together and stand up for what they feel is right.  In the end the crew triumphs (did we really think it would be otherwise?).<br />This is really not a film for people who are not already fans of the show as it is the way the characters act and their personal interactions that makes the film so entertaining.  Brent Spiner, Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis seem to have a tremendously fun time with this film.  Fans are treated to some great scenes of their favorite characters (although Gates McFadden was not particularly important).  We even learn some more about Data's design and operation.  But do not be misled by the title and the trailer, the scenes are all there but in the trailer they tell a much different story.<br />There are a few technical problems in the movie but you don't really think about them until afterwards.  These include small things like not being able to count (claiming two slave races and showing three), the Federation is pretty stupid (giving membership to a race that has just managed warpdrive but only has been around for less than a hundred years, has only six members and seems to have better ships).  There is the inevitable total ignorance of nebulae and what they are and just how not dense they are.  But these are all minor things that don't jump out as the movie progresses.<br />So if you are a Next Generation fan and want to see the crew back together in a story that is really just a long, but very good, episode, then you really should take the opportunity to see this one.  On a final note it passes Lynch's Law for a successful Next Generation episode in that it does not rely on techno-babble to drive or advance the plot but uses situation, character and emotion for fuel instead.
B0000C2IQD|3.0|Please read this review to the end, because it discusses several important highs AND lows about this DVD package.  It'd be unfortunate & unbalanced, if you only got half the picture.<br />1)  The main DVD (1 of 2) has the widescreen version of the film on one side, and the TV-square version on the other side.  This format makes SO much sense, and is good value for the customer.<br />2)   Disney, which usually overloads their VHS video and DVDs with ads, and shovels them at you BEFORE the main feature, has let their ads sit in the PROPER place, this time-- under \\"extras\\" in the DVD menu.  There are LOTS of extras-- a kids' book built-in on the DVD case, and some slightly puffy ad-interviews... but generally satisying despite the happy-happy-joy-joy quality of the interviews.<br />3) If my copy is typical, then the plastic Disney used in the DVD is substandard.  My copy of the DVD has no other signs of heavy use, but already has a PAIR of fractures extending from the center of the DVD to the silvered data-bearing surface.  Repeated insertion and removal from its standard pressure/friction-fit DVD case, will cause this DVD to quickly disintegrate into an unreadable coffee-cup coaster.<br />4)  Oh yeah-- the MOVIE. *grin*  It's pure Dick Van Dyke musical.  I'd love to say it's Dick Van Dyke + Julie Andrews, like Mary Poppins, but it's not.  However, the Julie Andrews replacement used in this film is completely acceptable, and does a job equal to Ms. Andrews' performances, and almost as pretty onscreen.<BR>Like the Andrews films \\"Sound of Music\\" and \\"Mary Poppins\\", the childrens' performances are somewhat weak.  Dick Van Dyke, however, is at the top of his game.  Amazing, in someone old enough to have grey in in his hair (40 something, at this point ?) is energetic enough to do over 20 takes (by his own reporting) of the \\"Old Bamboo\\" piece, where he's required to jump over a piece of bamboo that he's holding for himself (at slightly over waist height).  Good GOD, I may only know one person who can do that, even ONCE.<br />The music is memorable, especially the \\"living doll\\" duet late in the film.  The plot is predictable, and silly kids' stuff, but-- heck, this IS a kids' musical, so one can't expect a Dustin Hoffman acting level, with a Michael Moore punch and a Silence-of-the-Lambs plotline.<br />5)  Do you REALLY want to buy a Disney film, this year ?  I don't.  It'd send the wrong message to them, after they've withheld distribution (through their daughter-company Miramax) on the latest Michael Moore film (Fahrenheit 9/11).  Their excuse is, it'd endanger the million-dollar tax breaks they get from Bush's brother, Florida Governor Jeb Bush.  So, they're copping out on their contractual obligation to distribute the film that got Cannes Film Festival's top award.  That ain't right.  If they'd had objections, the time to raise them was when the contract wasn't yet signed.  Don't support these guys.  Not this year.
6301967992|4.0|Late one night many years ago I had the pleasure of watching the great Roman Polanski vampire film.  Now, many years later, I have added the complete and uncut edition to my collection.<br />This tongue-in-cheek begins with Professor Abronsius and his assistant (Polanski) arriving in Transylvania.  The professor, who has one of the silliest mustaches of all time, is researching the legends of vampires.  He is convinced that they really exist and that he can eliminate them.  Shortly after their arrival it becomes apparent that there are indeed strange creatures about.  All of the evidence convinces the professor that his suspicions are correct.<br />When the inn they are staying in is hit by a vampire the two journey to a bleak castle.  There they encounter the local lord, who is a vampire.  The lord and the professor hit it off quite well as both are men (ahem) of learning.  During the day the professor and his assistant search for the vampires tomb.  They find it but are unable to dispatch the creatures and wind up losing all of their tools in the process.  Then night falls.<br />With the fall of night the two become targets and must avoid their vampiric hosts.  then they make a startling discovery.  There are more vampires in the castle than just the lord and his son.  There is a graveyard filled with generations of bloodsuckers.  As the vampires hold an annual ball at which they will feast on a number of locals, the professor and his protégée manage to make off with one of the victims and successfully flee into the night pursued by a hunchback sledding in a coffin.<br />The film then ends with a very dark note.  The woman they have saved makes the complete transition to vampire while they are fleeing and she bites the young assistant.  It is in this way that the bumbling Professor Abronsius enabled vampirism to spread out of Transylvania into the rest of the world.<br />This edition restores the twenty minutes that were cut out when the film was first releasedin America.  This is an unusual film in that much is communicated through action.  The dialogue is rather sparse throughout.  But with the almost exaggerated actions of a silent film combined with a haunting score result in a richer movie than had it been full of dialogue.  The special effects, what few there are, are quite effective and possibly more effective than current effects.  In one scene the vampire killers and the woman they are trying to rescue are leading a dance at the ball.  The procession advances towards a mirror and only the three are reflected although dozens are in direct line.  Spectacular.  The rest of the film uses small dashes of comedy to season an otherwise dark story.  This is a true classic among vampire films.  If you have not seen it you should.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|I like Seth Green, and he did a fairly good job taming and personalizing an overblown character.  <br />The Italian scenery was entertaining.<br />...And that's where the compliments for this movie end.<br />The &quot;Italian&quot; part of this job is just the first few minutes.  So is its legitimate plot &amp; well-filmed action.  After 10 minutes, you can safely ignore-- or curse at--- the remainder of the film.<br />This is a feature-length commercial for the small, british car that has also plagued us through product placement in Austin Powers movies.<br />If product placement doesn't interfere with a movie's plotline, and never makes even an astute viewer think &quot;I've just PAID to watch a COMMERCIAL&quot; for even one moment, then I'm OK with it.  If a character in MIB (Tommy Lee Jones, Will SMith) just happens to be wearing a cool watch or sunglasses, FINE.<br />However, this... is not that.  FAR from it.  This is a movie that is so governed by its product placement, that it's a complete insult to anyone who paid to watch it, even if it's as a $1-rental-video.  Plot, photography, dialogue, physics-- it's all plastic bubble-wrapping around this brick of a commercial, and it's hurled through your window.<br />We're asked to believe that these low-slung, cramped matchbox cars are the TOOL OF CHOICE for (get this) stealing heavy gold from a California home...that just happens to have super-wide hallways and (huh ?) special rules of physics so hallway corners, doorways, and staircases are still navigable by these pathetic excuses for cars....WHILE LADEN WITH HEAVY GOLD.<BR>Oh yeah...and then, these selfsame cars that're pushed at us in the house, are the TOOL OF CHOICE for racing along huge truck-wide sewers and city streets.<br />No, no, NO !  Damnit, NO !<BR>&quot;THe Marketing Genius of Product Placement&quot; let his moronic intern write this movie.  Murder both of them-- No, their entire warped, pay-me-to-slap-you product placement agency.<br />In Japan, this movie was named after the car:  &quot;Mini, mini, mini.&quot;  Doesn't that tell you everything you need to know about the film ?  Go buy a movie that works to earn its purchase price, not this ersatz car commercial.
B000022TSW|5.0|This is the best musical of all time period. In some scenes it may seem a little corny, but it is pure genius. Matt Stone and Trey Parker know great comedy. If you haven't seen the full-length critically acclaimed film, you don't know what you're missing. If you haven't seen this, you definitely should. It is the funniest film of that year. It is one of my favorite films of all time. <br />Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sneak in to the rated R film \\"@$$e$ of Fire\\" a Terrance and Phillip production, when the film is filed with nothing but toilet humor, and the boys fragile little mind get possessed by all the cuss words. Then as the mothers of South Park find out about this film, it is time to reach Canada and tell them their humor stays in their country. But as Canada bombs the Baldwin's it is war. Then if the blood of the innocent (Terrance and Philip) touches the floor, Satin and Suddam Hussan will take over the world. Then it is up to the boys and their friends to stop the war. This film is filled with music and comedy. It also shows a great message that young children shouldn't watch rated R films, but I would still let little kids watch them. There just movies. <br />Personally out of this film, I think this is a must see film if you think it is offensive or not. It shows a great message and tolerance. You really shouldn't get offended by watching this film, behind all the jokes, it's all just fun and games. Even if you don't like musicals, trust me you will love the songs on this movie. In addition to buying this DVD you should also buy the soundtrack. It is the best soundtrack ever period. If you love the show, I know you won't be disappointed by this film. It is obnoxious and a triumph! It would have been better though if they released this DVD with extra features like commentary or behind the scenes but the film covers it. This is a definite must buy film if you loved the show. Enjoy!
B00005JMEW|1.0|The dialogue was written by committee.  Dialogue seems to be stupidly stiff like nobility, and the very next line from the same character will be slangy and rude.  <br />The action is beyond unbelievable.  For example, we're asked to believe that there's a direct flight from America to Okinawa (the southern boonies of Japan), and that Uma Thurman is able to smuggle a samurai sword through airplane security, then steal a motorbike (and matching leather clothes).  <br />And the photography.... Ohhhh, pleeeease.  I was praying for some airbrushing, or at least not so much close-up, when the camera was thrust close in on Uma Thurman's toes.  No offense, Uma, but nobody's toes are pretty in closeup, nobody's skin is pretty in closeup, and &quot;uma&quot; is the Japanese word for &quot;horse&quot;.  Arrrrgh.<br />From Quentin Tarrantino, I expect clever dialogue and well-drawn characters.  Instead, I got cheesy violent effects and a script that your preteen brother could write better.<br />And, for pete's sake-- if you're gonna claim that Lucy Liu is raised in Japan and heading the Japanese mafia, then TEACH HER TO SPEAK JAPANESE WELL.  By thunder, aren't there any decent dialogue coaches on Tarrantino's staff ?<br />This film is supposed to be a tribute to comic-books and the 1960s/70s mafia movies of Japan.  Instead, it's a cheesy insult to them...and us.<br />If you want perfect Tarrantino, see &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;From Dusk Til Dawn #1&quot;.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Just as Jay-z was walkin out the door, im thinkin man all we got left is Chingy, Ludacris, J-Kwon, and Nelly (rap has gone down the drain), but then in the backdoor comes Kanye West with his intelligent lyrics, old-school-flavored beats, and the ability to connect with his audience.  Here's a track listing:<br />2)We Don't Care - this song jumpstarts the cd with a cool beat and catchy chorus.  It sounds cool with the kids singing the chorus.  At first listen the song, might sound negative.  But there is an underlying message of doing what you need to get by, by any means necessary and improving the hand you were dealt in life.<br />3) Graduation Day - Just a funny interlude, of how Kanye won't receive his diploma.  But, the beat at the end of the interlude is pretty dope.<br />4) All Falls Down - After hearing and seeing this song everywhere, I have to remind myself that this is one of the most intelligent rap songs in a while.  We are all self conscious, he's just the 1st to admit it. <br />5) I'll Fly Away - A gospel hymn sung by a quartet introducing #6.<br />6) SPaceship - One of the highlights of the cd.  Kanye's verse is smoking and it has a great message. He's like bump the gap, bump school, I'm a work hard and get in my spaceship and fly away.<br />7) Jesus Walks - The highpoint of the cd along with number 8.  He is talkin about GOd and Jesus like no one before.  The signature line of the song &quot;Well if this takes away from my spins, which will probably take away from my ends, but I hope it takes away from my sins and bring the day that I'm dreamin bout...&quot; C'mon Kanye, u went to church wit that one.  REAL HOT!<br />8)Never LEt Me Down - The other pinnacle.  Jay-z drops two hot verses on this one. This song is so influential and positive and the chorus singing the hook makes it a classic.<br />9) Get Em High - This is the JAM!! The true club banger, Kanye invites COmmon and Talib Kweili to help him do some dirt on this one.   I think Kanye's 1st verse on this one is the hottest on the cd.  ANd Talib is hot too.  But Common comes and goes, but nonetheless its hotter than anything out there now.<br />10)Workout Plan - FREE 99!! Listen and u'll see what I mean<br />11) The NEw WOrkout PLan - very catchy and another club banger should be next single, even tho its one of everyones favorites its prob the one song that doesn't fit on the cd. but very funny, &quot; And I rode a plane!&quot;<br />12) Slow Jamz - I love this version with Jamie singin more.  After hearin this I wish Kanye had 2 verses and cut Twista down, cuz he takes away from the song.  Kanye and Jamie make this jam a slow jam!<br />13)Breathe in Breathe out - my least fave song on the cd, i wish luda had a verse besides the hook. It's good, but coulda been left off.Maybe cuz it is too much like what everyone else is doin.  And kanye knows that thats why he apologized to Mos and Kweili.<br />15) School Spirit - Very catchy and short.  I like it how the hook is callin out all of the fraternities and sororities.  He is still tellin everyone to shut up cuz hes gonna do what he wants.<br />17) Two Words - a good song and i really enjoy the harlem boys choir, but i dont understand the song.  ive listenend to it a lot, but i can't decipher the meaning of the song.  Exposing our corrupt society?  Very good and strong lyrics, freeway and mos def hold it down.<br />19) Family Business - One of my faves prob after 7,8,9! It has the kids singing the chorus and its like describing a family reunion one of the more personal songs on the album.<br />20)Last Call - Is a hot song.  But i love the song for the 10 minute dialougue at the end.  He explains his coming-up in the rap game and the beat is classic. <br />Kanye dropped out of the 14th grade, did he make the right choice to follow his heart.  Buy College Dropout and u'll see!!
B00020HEG6|5.0|I was at a recent premire for the Movie, and they played the soundtrack over and over. You can feel the excitement in this one. John Williams is superb and so is the chorus. I am hoping to get this for my birthday, and be able to take it with me when I attend Accio 2005: The Firtt Harry Potter Conference in the UK! Truely remarkable.
0064400557|5.0|Charlotte's Web was an okay book. The part that made me very sad was when the girl's parents made the pig go to the the uncle's house because they really liked the pig and they begged the parents not to let the pig go but the parents didn't want the pig to stay because it was getting too  big to stay on the farm. The parents told them that if the pig was not that big that they would have let it stay but the whole problem was that it got too big right away. When the pig was at the uncle's house the pig made a friend with a spider and the spider really liked the pig and the spider made really nice webs on the pigs door.The uncle took the pig to a fair to sign him up for a contest to win the contest the pig took first place and got a prize. And when the pig got home he was trying to find his friend the spider to tell him the good news but when he found the spider the spider was about to die.Come to find out the spider was having some babies and had  them in a little crate. So the spider had its babies and raised them in the little crate. The pig was very happy but he didn't know what was wrong with the spider when he came back from the compition. But than he found out the good news about the babies.Than she couldn't go back home with him he took the babies back to his home and the spider stood home and died slowly and before the pig knew the babie spiders hatched all of them left excepted for three and the pig cared for them as much as he cared for the spider and they lived happily ever after. <br />  I did like the book . I would recommend somebody to read this book
B000089RVR|5.0|Music, much like other medium and experiences, tends to thread it's way through our lives like stepping stones. We often hear a song and our first reaction is one of emotional continuity. We remember it as an landing that anchors an entire chapter of our life.<br />Dido is both totally unique and totally familier all at once. Her voice is perhaps unlike any I've ever heard. Nothing lofty and nothing that'll put any power siren out of business. But special in it's flavor of of whispy sultry comfort. When I say whispy I'm referring to something of a hush. That kind of hush that makes one feel that everything will be okay.<br />The music shares a similar duality. Very simple on a light ear, yet if you listen closely it's obvious the work that's gone into each song. Simple is good because it speaks to everyone. The depth within allows anyone of those 'everyone' to listen as deeply as they like without dissapointment.<br />The mix is a masterpiece. It isn't noticed unless that's the intent. It can be said that if you can hear the mix, it's not been well done. Again we're graced with simplicity by virtue of mastery of a complex process. For those of us who've had a bit of mixing experience we know that this is how it should be done.<br />As to the meat of the matter, everyone is going to have their own subjective opinion. It's an acoustic synth hybrid that calms without being a sleeper. Beautiful melodies against simple yet well used harmony. Best of all, like the voice of Dido, there's an unspoken 'hush - everything will be okay' quality to the music.<br />I've been across a lot of harsh water in my time, and if ever there were a stepping stone; a place that will live in the best of me as a refuge and an anchor to better things, 'Life for Rent' remains indellibly one.<br />Best regards -Frank
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is going to be on television -- so, needing to lose a little weight in order to fit into her nice red dress, she starts a regimen of diet pills. Meanwhile, her son Harry (Jared Leto) keeps hocking her TV to buy drugs for himself, his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). And from there, everything pretty much spirals downward to hell.<br />_Requiem for a Dream_ is based on the book of the same name (which I haven't read) by Hubert Selby, Jr. (who also cowrote the screenplay and makes a brief cameo appearance as the 'Laughing Guard'). Essentially, it's a harrowing study of addiction and its effect on hope. Although the film's primary focus is on drugs, other objects of addiction (television, sex, even food) take turns in the spotlight. And it's all pretty grueling. (Parts are darkly comic at the same time, as when Sara has to sneak into the room so as not to arouse her hungry refrigerator.)<br />With a lesser cast, or with any more self-conscious moralism in the screenplay, it would have toppled off of its highwire and turned into just another Special Episode of 'Blossom'. And with even a _little_ more of its already-overused nerve-jangling speedy-uppy-slowy-downy Technique-with-a-capital-T, it would have toppled over in the other direction and become just another pretentiously arty soap opera.<br />And that would have been a disaster. The topic itself isn't exactly new; what else could there possibly be to show us about it that we didn't see years ago in e.g. _Lost Weekend_ and _The Man With the Golden Arm_ and _Valley of the Dolls_ (never mind _Reefer Madness_ and _The Cocaine Fiends_)? Had this devolved into just another film in an already overloaded genre, it wouldn't merely have failed; it would have crashed and burned.<br />But it manages, somehow, to work. As I suggested above, a lot of the credit has to go to the cast; Ellen Burstyn is by God magnificent, and the three younger leads bring life to a trio that could easily have cliched itself into a sort of bizarro prequel to 'The Mod Squad'. Credit also goes to the appropriately jagged score by Clint Mansell (much of it performed by the Kronos Quartet).<br />The lion's share, though, goes to director Darren Aronofsky (who was also the other cowriter of the screenplay). With nearly anybody else, I'd suspect a desire to impress the world by making his second movie an Idiosyncratic, Shocking, Yet Deeply Significant Work of Art. But that suspicion doesn't really make sense applied to a guy whose _first_ movie was _Pi_. (This one is actually somewhat _less_ gonzo than that one.) Appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, Aronofsky has his craft under careful control.<br />Overall, then, this is a much, much better movie than it has any right to be. There's nothing really new in it; it's right on the edge of unbearably preachy (and on a relatively uncontroversial subject; does anybody think addiction is _good_?); it's got a strong flavor of deliberate 'art-housiness', if you know what I mean. But much to my surprise, it succeeds anyway, and somehow its characters manage to become sufficiently real for us to care about them even while they're totally screwing themselves up.<br />It's not cheerful, it's not pretty, it's not even easy to watch. But I'm impressed enough to watch it again. I may even read the book.<br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go have some coffee.ife to a trio that could easily have cliched itself into a sort of bizarro prequel to 'The Mod Squad'.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|I really think the only reason this movie went too far  is because the director is Francis Ford Coppola's daughter.<br />You can imagine this movie directed for some stranger and you will see nobody would say is a good movie. I really think is a terrible terrible movie and I never thought a  movie so bad could even be consider as ANY Oscar winner.
B0001WTUH6|3.0|. . . but it doesn't live up to either its hype or its pretensions.<br />It wants to be _The Crow_. It wants to be _The Matrix_. It wants to be _Blade_. It wants to be _Dark City_. It wants to be _Lara Croft: Tomb Raider_. It wants to be the Next Great Vampire/Werewolf Movie. And it isn't any of them.<br />What it _is_ is a pretty good (and fairly novel) film in the gothic-horror genre. But that's all it is.<br />The idea here is a perfectly good one. Kate Beckinsale is Selene, a vampire who hunts 'Lycans' (werewolves, from 'lycanthropes'). Apparently there's been a war between these two species for lots of centuries, and there's a human being (Scott Speedman) who has something or other to do with a recent burst of Lycan activity.<br />The whole thing is fairly well handled (including the special effects), and it's at least fun to watch even if the characters are rather one-dimensional. If you want to see a sorta-PoMo/SF-inflected leather-and-guns goth wetdream, this is a good choice. It even bears up pretty well under repeated viewing.<br />But you'll be disappointed if you expect it to be everything it's been billed as. It ain't. The look is excellent and the production values are high, but it's mostly surface gloss: there is, let's say, a high style-to-substance ratio.

B00000I8DY|5.0|There's not much I can add to the previous reviews. However, I can assure you - they do not exaggerate.  Cosi fan tutte, is one of my favorite operas, and I thought we'd never see a recording that could rival Bohm's great recording on EMI, or Solti's great set on DECCA, and Davis' superb effort on Phillips.  Well, this set not only rivals those sets, but beats them hands-down, in almost every way, shape, and form.<br />If you're looking for your first Cosi recording or you're looking to add another to your collection - this is the one to get.  It's simply miraculous!
0060528737|5.0|There's no other way of putting it. It is amazing how clearly this book stands head and shoulders above *every* other book I've ever read (except for the first two of the series). I also love movies, but can't pick out any favorites, since there have been none that are so far superior. This series took my breath away. Both I and my wife read them in single sittings and have both started rereading them... Until he writes another sequel (an interview with him indicated that he *might*) or otherwise returns to the Old World what he has created will just have to do. Truly fantastic stuff. Given the absolute depth and sincerety of his writing and the way it resonates as being true to the harsh realities, and surprising joys of life is truly unique. I haven't read any of Garth Nix's other writings, as I hold him in such high regard for the Old World series and don't want to tarnish that. Anyway, I don't often take the time to write reviews, but I just had to put in my praise of these books! Abe
B000059Z8M|4.0|Woody (Tom Hanks), who turns out to be a rare collectible, is stolen by an unscrupulous toy store owner and slated to be sold to a toy museum in Japan.  Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and friends embark on a dangerous cross-town rescue mission.  This is a very entertaining and perceptive film that remembers the guilt that a child can feel over outgrowing a favorite toy.  Sammy the bear was my own constant companion when I was a young child.  As I grew older, I sometimes felt a pang of shame when I would encounter him lying unloved and unplayed-with in the bottom of my old toy chest.  I hope he's as philosophical and understanding about it as Woody is.  As cheerful as this film is, it takes on an added dimension by honoring that first melancholy that a child feels upon outgrowing a formerly cherished plaything.  The animation and voice talent are also top-notch.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|For all the people who just picked up on what slipknot was as &quot;Duality&quot; apeared on the radio and mtv.. this isn't Slipknot.  I'm glad you like the album and all, and i do like some of the songs, but the point is.. some of these songs (acoustic) don't belong on the damn album.  Honestly, i can't bring myself to listen to most of this cd.  It makes me feel as if i'm doing something wrong, or maybe i shouldn't even be listening to such a thing.  There should never be such a thing like soft Slipknot.  For the Veteran Slipkot fans, you should feel the same as I.  Slipknot was about the metal, the melodic, but heavy chorus', and the all inspiring audience who knows every screamed note in the chorus of &quot;Surfacing&quot;.  I don't think we'd find that in the hardcore followers of this album.<br />-Stay Sic-
0920668372|3.0|My three-year-old son has both Love You Forever and Guess How Much I Love You in his bookcase, and he never asks for Guess How Much I Love You and always asks for Love You Forever.  I don't particularly care for it; it's not very well-written and the illustrations bother me, but  I have never felt it was weird or creepy.  Isn't part of being a parent recognizing that your child may have preferences that are different from yours?
B00005JMEW|5.0|You shouldn't love these characters. Killers, every one of them. But you do. You find yourself rooting or the bride. Sorry she had to kill, but knowing it was for the best. Mabye you'd do the same if it were you. Mabye. I love Tarentino's way of making you suspend your belifs for a few hours. There is no good or evil. Just these slightly tilted characters. This movie was violent!!!! But in a satisfying revenge-or-die-trying kind of way. Excellent characters. Excellent story. Amazing movie. You MUST own it!!
B000001F5F|4.0|U2 have always been known for their exciting live performances, even into the 21st century with the Elevation Tour they still astounded everyone with their stage abilities. &quot;Under A Blood Red Sky&quot; chronicles the live U2 from the 80's when the band was just beginning to be seen as a true worldwide force in rock n' roll. It's an album filled with the youthful driving force of the band as they produced original, driven music and edged ever closer to world domination. &quot;Gloria&quot; opens things with a grand, religious fervor, it sounds like a hymn written for the modern age (U2 is considered a major influence on Christian artists). Guitarist The Edge shows his talent here for awesome slide guitar while Bono displays a lot of his range here. The band's first international hit, &quot;I Will Follow&quot; is here of course, the curious thing about this recording that will make some cringe and others listen with interest is that the mix has brought up Adam Clayton's bass almost over the guitar. Though one misses more the driving guitar notes, it's still fascinating to hear Adam Clayton's bouncing, skillfull playing. A rousing &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; is here with it's marching rhythm and vibe of war cry turned into a cry for peace. One of the stand out tracks is &quot;New Year's Day,&quot; the band really gels well here and turns the song into a scorching anthem or expression. &quot;40&quot; is a nice, passive moment and with lyrics borrowed from the book of Pslams it's a piece with depth. One of the rarities that makes the disc worth purchasing is also the fact that lesser known songs for the none U2 phile are here as well like the evocative &quot;Party Girl&quot; and almost punkish &quot;The Electric Co.&quot; 20+ years since this record was released hasn't taken away from the impact of the band's spirit and power which resonates in the music. It's a good live album, the only fault that makes it lesser than great is that it deserves to have more songs in it. It's a good candidate for a later remastered issuing.
6302814782|5.0|This is the movie that started it all for me.  Vampires into rock n roll, and the lead actor looking like Jim Morrison who can ask for anything more.  I loved how the culture of the 80's was brought out in this classic horror film.  The Big Hair, the tight pants, the rock n roll, and vampires all in one, who could ask for more.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants a scare.
B000089RVR|5.0|when an 'outofnowhere' singer became huge with her debut album release their followup album.<BR>some of them might get more creative control in their 2nd album. some of them might come out <BR>with a different sound, some of them play it safe. but not many of them really stand out as high<BR>as their debut effort. list such as, nelly furtado, norah jones, failed to captivate me with <BR>their 2nd effort. Taking that into consideration, i also doubt dido's sophomore album: which came out<BR>not like what i think it will be. Dido shines in her new album. I guess that what happen a brilliant<BR>songwriter team up with a brilliant composer(her faithless brother). Life for rent is a well crafted<BR>effort of a simple song writing with addictive sound. the message of the song strike straight to the heart<BR>of its listener.like it or not.Dido is one of the best female song writer. The one and only female<BR>song writer who can write song with simple words but meaningful. the album starts with <br />life for rent- well crafted, carefully written, addictive chorus. this song means alot to her. and<BR>im sure, to others also. 10/10<BR>stoned - this song is got a housey vibe in it.which is good. i reckon dido voice the house mix song.<BR>she has that soothing addictive voice. dj, mix this song will ya. 8/10<BR>life for rent - addictive guitar chord. simple. sad. OMG.this song popz! 10/10<BR>marys in india - dis is a storytellin song. its a bit country. ballad. a good song. just the guitar and <BR>dido's voice. 10/10<BR>see you when youre 40 - uptempo song. but slower than stoned. focus more on dido soothing voice and drums. 7/10<BR>dont leave home - dis is a love song. sweet.the message is clear. jeez! i just luv the guitar!!<BR>haunting!3rd single from the album.10/10<BR>who makes you feel - this song has many layer of sound. i like dis one cause its a bit of 21 question song.and<BR>the sound has this 'yeap yeap' everytime dido finish her question. kinda funky. kinda flirty.kinda dark.its hip. 8/10<BR>sand in my shoe - Im Soo into dis song. the music is hip. urban, fast beat. simple. straight to the point.edgy.<BR>addictive. great singing along song. totally a live show song. 11/10<BR>do you have a lil time - slow ballad, not dark enough but mellow. the music is kinda lazy. with one main 'sound loops' song and added sound<BR>here and there. least favourite. maybe shes experimenting.well...it doesnt work for me tho. 5/10<BR>this land is mine - somehow i cant help myself but imaginin a sun finally set after that dark slow ' do you have a lil time'.<BR>i keep imaginin sun risin up when listenin to dis song. a good relief. nice simple guitar riffs. dis is definately a camp fire song. :) 10/10<BR>see the sun - its the last song. and this song definately has that 'encore' vibe. a bit average but able to give that last satisfaction to press on the replay button again. 10/10<br />life for rent is definately a standing ovation piece of work. if theres an award for best sophomore album. dido is definately a winner!
B000096I9G|4.0|As a few of the other reviewers stated, the visuals of the DVD are not particulary engrossing. however, it was a recording of concerts they did actually play, and i found their performance on the DVD to be very similar to seeing them live.<br />I did not find fault with any of the songs - i never expected them to be studio perfect. the imperfection of the performance gave the impression that the band is just human after all.<br />what i did find particularly interesting was the commentary. i love getting a &quot;sneak peek&quot; into the minds of my favorite people.<br />I truly enjoyed this DVD and am very happy I bought it! I'd recommend it to any Cure fan!
B00000JNO2|5.0|Let me start by saying I tend to be fond of underrated albums by my favorite bands like The Who By Numbers, Led Zeppelin's Presence or Queen's second album, and Gimme Back My Bullets is another sample of it. Why this one is normally low-rated by fans of the true Lynyrd Skynyrd is beyond me. They probably blame it on the fact that the album is not as hard as the previous ones. So what? Doesn't a band deserve to evolute? <br />On this album Billy Powell's piano and organ are more present than on the others which adds variety to the music, like the acoustic guitars do as well.<br />Okay, there's no hit singles here but then again it's not what makes a cd great. The quality is obviously present here and Ronnie's lyrics cut so deep, pointing the finger at those who were squeezing the band by forcing them to tour nonstop (the title track) or showing his fondness for traveling entertainers (Roll Gypsy Roll, by the way one of my favorite Skynyrd tunes). Ronnie's vocals and lyrics are so heartfelt and the arrangement so moving......mmm, can't play this song only once.<br />Double Trouble is an autobiographical lyric about the several times his rowdy behaviour while drunk had put him behind bars. The riff is great though not as much as in Cry For The Bad Man. How I love this one. Gary Rossington was not as fast guitarist as Allen Collins (We miss you man) but the solo is fantastic. Another kickass tune is the cover of I Got The Same Old Blues, the funkiest Skynyrd ever got. Cool slide solo by Gary and also a great harmonica break by Lee Freeman, at last credited. <br />Ah, I forgot another moving (Though not slow) song - Searching. That melancholic guitar intro and solo by Gary is fantastic, and the final solos by him and Allen makes you miss the classic Skynyrd sound instead of the garbage (Hurts me to be so blunt but it's the truth) the current band are doing nowadays.<br />I also enjoy Every Mother's Son, Trust and All I Can Do Is Write About It, although not as much as the ones mentioned above.<br />All in all, a sadly underrated Skynyrd effort. The only complaint I have is that Ronnie's vocals are mixed so low. I'm still waiting for someone to clear this up.<br />4/5.
0141301066|4.0|Have you every noticed how some peoples, parents really care whether their kids do well in school or not, and there are some who want their children to do well in life. There are also different types of kids. There are some that want to learn and there are some that don't care if they learn anything.  There are also many combinations of attitudes differences between parent and child. For example, some kids don't what to learn and get an education but the parents do. <BR>Matilda by Roald Dahl tells a story about a five year old girl that has wanted to learn since she was 1  years old. But because of her parent's attitudes about learning, they did not embrace her extraordinary mind. She is so extraordinary that she taught herself to read by the age of three. <BR>Roald Dahl gives a wonderful view of how people don't want to admit that someone might be smarter then them. For example, Matilda thinks that her dad is jealous of her because she is smart. She also thinks that somewhere deep inside her dad wishes he was smart, like Matilda. <BR>This book also taught me how really important books are and how books are full of wisdom and a chance to learn something new. I strongly suggest this book if  you love learning new things.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow. That is the only word I can say about this CD. Christina Aguilera has grown up quite a bit, and her image is not the only thing that shows it. Her music has matured quite a bit from her first release, Just Be Free. A lot of this music on here displays her struggles, her feelings, and most of all, her true self. From the shocking &quot;I'm Ok&quot; to the powerful self love ballad &quot;Beautiful&quot;, Christina shows her emotional growth.<br />This album doesn't have nearly the commercialized pop vibe that her last release did. And that is what makes it so great. There are a couple of songs that I consider my favorites on here. There's the touching &quot;Voice Within&quot; that is an inspiring ballad to the young girls out there going through the turbulent teen years. &quot;I'm Ok&quot; is a great song that shows the pain she went through as a child and is still trying to recover from to this day.<br />I say buy this album if you're tired of the bubble gummy pop you're used to hearing.
B00006690G|4.0|\\"The Eminem Show\\" is a good CD, but a lot of the songs aren't very good.  The best songs are \\"White America\\", \\"Business\\", \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\", \\"Square Dance\\", \\"Soldier\\", and \\"Without Me\\", and just those songs make the CD worth buying.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I usually wait until after a couple months of a CD being out to buy it. But with this, once I heard it on Rhapsody, I knew I had to have it. <BR>What can I say? This is by far one of the better Britney efforts. From Me Against The Music to Everytime, the CD is addictive. It showcases her emotional tender side with Everytime, and her sultry sexuality exudes from Touch of My Hand. Britney is now a woman, and she's making sure to assert that fact.<br />The first song I'd recommend listening to is Shadow. This is a ballad, but a good one at that. Her vocal range is good on this track. It is also a well written song. She really puts emotion in it. Next up is Breathe On Me. It's got the most awesome beat, and just makes you feel like you're bumping and grinding in a dark club with lots of sweaty half-dressed people. The effects in this song are great. <BR>The other song that really displays her raw talent is Everytime. It's a slow haunting ballad that has such a chilling melody, including music boxes and chimes. Her voice wavers at times, displaying the emotional aspect this song has to it. I also find it to be an \\"I'm sorry\\" song aimed at ex, Justin Timberake. <br />All in all, I would recommend this album hands down to any of her others. This CD displays the maturing she did during her six month hiatus before it was released. An excellent buy!
B000002JS6|4.0|I heard one of their songs once (don't know which song) and I didn't like it that much.  But later on I heard part of &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, and I thought that it was pretty good.  So I bought &quot;Back In Black&quot; and I like it a lot.  The only song I don't like is &quot;Shake A Leg&quot; ( I don't like it becuase the chorus gets annoying).  Rock fans should definately get this CD.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Finally, after a long hiatus, withstanding the empty threats of a break up and numerous side projects, the crew in SLIPKNOT holed themselves up in the infamous Laural Canyon mansion (to name one, the Chili Peppers recorded there) to record their third major labeled record. It's technically their fourth overall album but many were unaware of their initial release so we will consider \\"Volume 3\\" the third effort in an impressive and commercially ground breaking set of albums. Once they announced they were heading into the supposed \\"haunted mansion\\" to record their record, press releases and interviews followed quickly with members of the band claiming how great and \\"totally deviant\\" the new album would be. Adding to the hype was their decision to have the acclaimed producer, Rick Rubin, at the mixing board. For any Slipknot fans, this is a definite must have! Every aspect of their music you enjoyed in the first two albums is here; Corey Taylor's signature growls, heavy but munching guitar riffage, unearthly loops and a sympony of tribal drumming. They did display a larger portion of their affinity to experiment in a handful of tracks but throughout the album they always came back to what made them the underground and commercial icons they are today. However, there were two important distinctions of note when measured up against their previous work; 1-the overall production of the record and 2-the application of massive grooves. Right from the beginning, you will clearly notice Rick Rubin's professional touch. He is known for his ability to polish and thoroghly clean up a bands sound as well as implementing his demands for technical perfection. It was obvious he expected no less from Slipknot and this album depicts a Slipknot in a way we have never heard before. For the first time, you can definitively hear every instrument. From the percussion, (including the pounding of the keg) the guitars, the loops and all of the backing vocals, you won't miss an ounce of noise. For once, the listener is exposed to ALL of the talented hooks laid down by the guitarists in addition to each band members contribution to this embroiled mass of orchestration we have come to love. The second distinction between this album and the previous ones is most apparent in the style of grooves that still retain the mosh style gusto but with emphasis on manintaining a smoothly catching harmony. Accompanying those harmonies are choruses that seem more rock based as they did in the \\"Iowa\\" record. Rest assured, this album was a natural progression for Slipknot and they didn't depart from thier epitaph of style. If you are a SLIPKNOT parvenu and are waiting to call them a \\"sell out\\", this isn't the record to do so. They truly and thankfully stayed true to their calling with some minor, but acceptable exceptions. They announced thier intentions for this record on many ocassions and delivered it on a silver platter. As it stands now, this could be the best metal record of 2004.
B000009ED0|4.0|&quot;Devil Without A Cause&quot; is a lot better than I thought it would be.  It opens up with &quot;Bawitdaba&quot;, which is one of the best song's on the CD.  My other favorites are &quot;Devil Without A Cause&quot;, &quot;I Am The Bullgod&quot; and &quot;F-ck Off&quot;.  If you like rap-rock than you should get this CD.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower, written by Stephen Chbosky, is a coming of age story that portrays the teenage life of a boy named Charlie, who is just entering High School. He battles with finding new friends, trying drugs, fitting in, and overall, just finding himself in the world. \\"I went to the library and checked out a book because I was getting scared . . . The book said that sometimes people take LSD, and they don't really get out of it . . . I started breathing fast in the library\\" (Chbosky 101). Charlie experimented with LSD, and realized that just because his friends did something, that didn't mean he had to do it too. <br /> I highly recommend this book. It's a page turner that has a lot going for it. There is a very clear plot. \\"I just wish that god or my parents or Sam or my sister or someone would just tell me what's wrong with me\\" (Chbosky 139). Charlie just wants to know who he is. He's tired of trying to find out on his own, and he's ready to just have someone tell him. Charlie deals with a lot in this coming of age novel. He is the source of the major conflict in the story. \\"Patrick did call me, but all he said was that Craig got really angry at Sam about me, and I should keep staying away until things got clear\\" (Chbosky 130). All of Charlie's friends got mad at him when he kissed his true love, Sam, instead of his own girlfriend, in a game of \\"Truth or Dare\\". Everyone turned against him, but this was just the beginning. Many things happen to Charlie, that by the end of the story, you feel as though you know him yourself.<br /> Read this book! No matter your age or gender, it's one that everyone can enjoy. It's the coming of age story of a boy who is lost, and it portrays a wonderful new perspective if a teenage boy. Adults will learn, or be reminded of what it's actually like to be young, and kids will just understand completely. The Perks of Being a Wallflower, written by Stephen Chbosky, is a well-written, well-rounded novel that I highly recommend!

B00005QZ7U|5.0|I could go on and on about Moulin Rouge, as it is one of my all time favs, but don't have the space to do so here.  The following is thus some exerts from a paper I wrote on Moulin Rouge shortly after its release.  The paper attempts to uncover and discuss what I feel Moulin Rouge is truly about.<br />Moulin Rouge is an exquisite example of a film that deals with a number of concepts that are highly important within the postmodern world.  Quite simply, one of the key components of Moulin Rouge, and possibly the main theme of the film, is its questioning and reaffirming of the value of art within a postmodern culture.  According to Jean Baudrillard in his essay \\"After the Orgy\\":<br />\\"When everything is political, nothing is political any more, the word itself is meaningless.  When everything is sexual, nothing is sexual any more, and sex loses its determinants.  When everything is aesthetic, nothing is beautiful or ugly any more, and art itself disappears.\\"<br />Within the postmodern realm described by Baudrillard, art no longer has the value it once did, and whether or not it even has any value at all is a valid question.  Moulin Rouge plays on this key notion of postmodern thought throughout the film, as it constantly questions this viewpoint.  In order to do so, a number of classic pop-songs are recycled within the construction of the film. The songs (two important examples being \\"Your Song\\" by Elton John and \\"Silly Love Songs\\" by Wings) are present not only for nostalgic and emotional purposes, but for master-narrative purposes as well, as it is through the use of such songs that the film does its questioning of the post-modern.  The songs (which are almost all directly connected to love) are obviously portrayed as still being important based on the lyrics that have been chosen.  The most prolific example of this occurs in the medley sequence of the film in which Christian and Satine sing the following songs from \\"Silly Love Songs\\":<br />\\"You'd think that peoplewould have had enough of silly love longs.  But I look around me and I see it isn't so.  Some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs.  And what's wrong with that?  I'd like to know.\\"<br />Because they play such an important role in the film, the referenced songs, must be seen as advocating that love songs (and on a greater level, the notion of art itself) still have value today within the post-modern realm.  Moulin Rouge can thus be seen as attempting to discredit the post-modern ideal at hand. <br />Yet, at the same time in reconstructing pieces of old songs for a new purpose, the film also employs one of the key aspects of postmodernism.  Because Moulin Rouge references and recycles so many ideas, it is in its construction a very post-modern film. Moulin Rouge is thus a postmodern film (in theme and in construction) that in some ways discredits one of the key driving notions behind postmodern thought (that art is dead) at the same time through its narrative choices.<br />****, (10/10)
B0000D96NW|5.0|Machine Head is back! After seeing them for the first time in concert when they released &quot;Burn My Eyes,&quot; not knowing who they were, I was blown away!!! I could not belive my ears what I was listening to!  Something so raw, full of color, a groove flowing so smoothly that's like an ever changing &quot;no holds bared&quot; attitude.  After years and albums, I'm glad to listen &amp; know they're not going to disappear nor weaken!  This album makes you forget your fears, takes you to another level and leaves you with an anxiety so nauseous you feel as if you're going to storm the beaches at Normandy ready to shred, seek out &amp; destroy at will, overcoming the fear of the enemy! They have come back stronger than ever!!!  Their best album yet!!!
0451526384|5.0|Over the years, I have read &quot;Persuasion&quot; by Jane Austen at LEAST 10 times. Simply put, it is my favorite book. While not everyone holds this novel with the same high esteem that I do, I urge those who have NOT read &quot;Persuasion&quot; to buy it.<br />This book has meant different things to me at different times in my life.  I have often reflected why I find the story so fascinating and believe it is because it so accurately portrays the human spirit and exposes our flaws and strengths with such transparency.<br />Jane Austen reveals those who are so superficial that they see no goodness or worth other than beauty and wealth (Anne's father and sister); those who are so dependent that they do not listen to their own heart - but instead leave their most important decisions for others to make (Anne herself); and those whose pride has been wounded.<br />And perhaps what is so captivating, Austen lets the reader vicariously &quot;undo&quot; an error in judgment. This is an excellent and timeless novel.
B00001NFCY|1.0|yeah this is great lololololololol the singer sounds like he's clearing his throat the whole time lolololol!!!!!
B000000643|5.0|when I first bought it.  I had heard the BBC version of Who Knows Where the Time Goes, and was intrigued by Fairport Convention, so I purchased this album, as it was a toss-up between this one and What We Did on our Holidays.  I listened to it, and really was horribly disappointed in it.<br />Then, after picking it up a few months later for another listen, it started to grow on me.  Now, I swear I play it at least once a week, if not more often.  IT REALLY SNEAKS UP ON YOU.  Not even mentioning the subtle beauty of Sandy Denny's voice, the guitar work is fantastic.  <br />Songs I like the least:<br />Percy's Song - too long, but the story the songs tells makes it listenable.<br />Si Tu Dois Partir  - I don't speak French, and didn't realize it was a Bob Dylan song.  But musically, it's FUN to listen to.  <br />Favorites:<br />Who Knows Where the Time Goes - the emotion in Sandy Denny's voice really makes it a wonderful tune<br />A Sailor's Life - at first I thought it was too long and drawn out.  It is by far my favorite.  There's just so much in it to listen to.<br />Autopsy - I like the time change in the song.  Not to many rock songs are in 3/4 time.  <br />Million Dollar Bash - just a cool song, musically and lyrically<br />Overall, it's a nice album to listen to.  Fairport Convention is such a complex band.  Worth the listen.
0316666343|5.0|&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold is an exhilarating book to read. It is full of suspense and keeps you reading until the last page of book! Sebold's word choice and descriptions make you feel like you are there in the book! I recommend that you shouldn't start reading &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; unless you can finish reading it! <BR>&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold is mesmerizing! Susie Salmon a 14 year old girl who is brutally raped and murdered by her neighbor tells the story about the circumstances of her murder through her eyes, while she is in heaven. I found this unusual story because it is told from the perspective of the murdered victim. Even though you know who kills her and how she is killed in the very beginning of the book, the story is still suspenseful through Susie Salmon's eyes, and her family and friends trying to cope with her death and find out the missing pieces of the puzzle. The question of whether Susie's killer would be caught was enough to keep me reading. You will also find yourself thinking about your ideas of life after death, as Alice Sebold presents a different picture of heaven than most of us have ever thought of.
0684808323|4.0|This book IS NOT fiction.  It is the true story that the movie Casino was based on.<br />In the book, the names have not been changed and there are a few more details than in the movie.<br />If you like the movie, I suggest reading the book to get the whole picture of what went down.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|Take away for one second the fact that this is an Eric Clapton album. Take away, too, that all the songs are by Robert Johnson. Listen to it as a piece of music, for what it is worth.<br />Sadly, you'll find it isn't worth much at all.<br />The arrangements are bland and contrived - monotonous, mathematically correct blues for beginners. No feeling at all. The singing is lacklustre and unemotive. If this were a band trying to get their first recording contract, they wouldn't get one. It sounds more like a self-indulgent bar band playing WITH their Johnsons, than an accomplished blues guitarist playing Robert Johnson.<br />What went wrong? Clapton loves the blues, and has made incredible covers of Johnson tunes before (whether sticking close to the original, or taking them off in imaginative new directions), always with a heatfelt love of the music. I can only assume he was in a creative slump, and decided to pull what he thought would be a guaranteed ace out of the hole. Sadly, it didn't work.<br />If you are a hotel manager looking for some nice, safe muzak that won't offend the little old ladies and can easily be tuned out, buy this stinker. If you are looking for a blues album, don't bother - I've heard more soulful, heartfelt blues in a Britney Spears song.
B000005JA8|4.0|O.K. PEOPLE, GET A HOLD OF YOURSELVES!!<br />The reviewing page for this cd has turned into a forum for the slanderous voices of many people whose votes get appreciated for similarity of opinion and not quality of review!<br />Literally I see a feeding frenzy of those who despise Captain Beefheart, for whatever reason, uniting in a campaign to support each other. This is not what reviewing is all about, and you people know it. One to three sentence reviews don't cut it, and personally I, nor any other near objective observer cares to read or be puzzled by the support of these pi$s poor reviews.<br />TO A REAL REVIEW:: <br />**Preface:: Many of the previous reviewers wish to convey their beliefs that Captain Beefheart is an elitist, who thinks his gibberish is, \\"more smart,\\" than regular language. They also wish to convince you that musicians such as Frank Zappa are where it is really at. For the purposes of comparison, allow me to quote some Zappa to show you where the real elitism is: \\"all you Jesus Freaks go home, no one wants to hear you,\\" and \\"I experienced the real depths of life.\\" Now, by no means am I a Jesus freak, and my own beliefs are not applicable in this review, but I wish to illuminate both judgment and elitism by a musician that thought so highly of himself he decided to melt from drugged out pop/folk into musical theory and compose a series of symphonies. I would be exhibiting repetitive language to explain myself here.<br />**NOW, Beefheart and his band of unstable (pre-avant-garde) musicians made no attempts to create their own language, like the pretentious Sigur Ros, or to recreate music. THEY ACTUALLY ARE BEING TRUE TO A STYLE OF MUSIC AND LANGUAGE THAT EXISTS. *****Trout Mask Replica is based on the musical themes, (more importantly style and impatience) of hobo music. That's right, hobo music. The American Hobo has more than a simple right to be represented artistically; he is the bedraggled bard of previous times, he is the source for authentic folk music. <br />Beefheart chooses to not romanticize the hobo aesthetic, but to portray it accurately and goofily, as the dispositions of hobos predominantly are. (I can speak from experience here, having been homeless in Boston for a time, and having traveled well across America.)<BR>This cd is out there, as is the mental meanderings of most homeless people or vagrants. Beefheart himself appears to stutter in the midst of his performance, so swept in the insane pseudo-improvisational style he chooses to adapt. Just look at the cd in simile to James Joyce's, \\"Finnegans Wake,\\" only in the sense that there is a synonymous artistic utilization of 'stream of consciousness'; but with a sense of humor, and (especially) without all the pretension. ;) <br />This cd is a light-hearted hilarious journey to the heart of the hobo aesthetic. If you can have a sense of humor about the performing arts, and don't have an inferiority complex when things confuse you; instead your response is laughter and wonder, then this cd will make your day.<br />4 and 1/2 stars.
0385510438|1.0|This book was a real snooze. It seemed to go on forever. The ending was incredibly anti-climactic. Grisham could have done something bold at the end (think sister), but went with some obscure, hardly believable, ending. Very, very weak. Don't waste your money or time.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never heard of this show until I saw it in the sci-fi listing. Bought it just to explore and was completely blown away with the quality of it. <br />The shows has a cool, serene aura to it, the characters are interesting, the storyline is compeling and the actors are great.<BR>I was completely smitten with Kaylee ;-)<br />I really, really liked it. I now I want more!
0062502182|4.0|Paulo Coelho's captivative novel is a mild well-written story that allows readers to interpret it in any way they choose.. A candid description of a person's and everybody's need to realize one's destiny as the only compulsion.<br />This is a story about an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago who ventures from his homeland in Spain to North Africa in search of a treasure buried in the Pyramids. Along the way he meets a beautiful, young gypsy woman, a man who calls himself a king, and an alchemist, all of whom point Santiago in the direction of his quest. No one knows what the treasure is , but the boy tries to overcome the obstacles along the way through the desert. At the end of the day.. what is important is the treasures found within rather than the worldly possessions.<br />The words of wisdom don't come as heavy logs , but in small simple bundles which are easily taken in coz its something that one already knows, but never traversed through that kind of thought process.<br />Follow your heart and you would never want to get rid of this one!
B0001DI0FI|5.0|This recent movie Master and Commander is a fascinating adventure story of the H.M.S. Surprise chasing the Acheron, a much larger and faster ship. I enjoy this movie because it brings you back in time to 1805 and shows the cramped life aboard a ship as well as how gruesome a sea battle was to fight. It shows the importance of hierarchy, cooperation and obedience that was needed aboard the ship to keep it going especially during battles and storms. I also enjoy this movie because of the sometimes gruesome action and battle scenes. For example, in the first battle the as canon balls hit the ship and splinters fly, a young midshipman, named Blakeney, is hit. His arm is eventually amputated because of gangrene. Then in the last battle between the Surprise and the Acheron you have canon balls, splinters and bullets fling in every direction; swords clanging and men killed all around. But in between the battles and storms, the captain and the surgeon play the violin and the cello.   Peter Weir, the director of Master and Commander, combined and adapted books #1 and #10 of Patrick O&#146;Brian&#146;s Aubrey and Maturin 20 book series. To make the fully sea worthy H.M.S Surprise he refitted a ship called The Rose*. He picked Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany to portray the characters Aubrey and Maturin. He had the characters hardly touch land to show the hard life aboard a ship during the 1800&#146;s and the gruesome battles fought at sea. With C.G.I. he brought to life the fearsome storms and battles and with the make-up, made the gruesome wounds of sea battle look real.In all, Master and Commander is a great movie. I highly recommend it to all who like action and adventure movies to see it.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The only way to appreciate this movie and the trilogy fully is to understand the source of its ideas.  As a student of mythology and cognitive science, I knew right away that this film had deep roots in perennial ideas.  There is the classic story of the psychological-mythical union of opposites, the power of love, the possibility of artificial intelligence, the duality of mind-body/subjective-objective.  All portrayed in the sort of charicatures that are mythic-archetypal icons rather than modern personalities.  In other words, you may have to be a bit of a scholar in philosophy, mythology and modern science to fully understand the craft of this movie and the trilogy.<br /><br />Mythic stories are an acquired taste.  They are full of ideas symbolically represented and if you aren't familiar with the symbols the significance of certain things will go entirely unnoticed.  The whole trilogy is an amazing study in story form of the possibilities of free will, exploring the boundaries of what consciousness is and the possibilities of technology to radically enlarge our universe.  Consider the notion that the real universe, the universe of the the machines and Zion, is only part of the whole of reality.  The other part is our imagination.  The matrix is only the most insiduous use of virtual technology.  If we immerse ourselves willingly in it then we can enjoy the powers that the Zionists had used to desperately pursue their cause.<br /><br />Matrix Revolutions ends with this arrangement as a distinct possibility, that humans are free to live outside of the Matrix.  Why not choose to live in both worlds?  Neo's sacrifice (both Christ-like and Taoist in its character (remember Luke Skywalker's willingness to lay down his saber?)) opens up possiblities beyond anything most of us have considered.  The scene with the Oracle and the Architect shows again how two opposite elements have, after a number of \\"cosmic cycles\\" of the matrix simulation resolved a higher balance in the program world between balance and imbalance, between a dynamic (chaos theory, complexity theory) and static equilibriums.<br /><br />This is merely one thread of perennial thought that this movie embodies.  It really is a masterwork of myth, philosophy and science fiction.  Beside that is does have kick ass action!between balance and imbalance, between a dynamic (chaos theory, complexity theory) and static equilibriums.    This is merely one thread of perennial thought that this movie embodies.  It really is a masterwork of myth, philosophy and science fiction.  Beside that is does have kick ass action!
6305428557|1.0|I would have rather spent a full 6 hours of an evening watchign a boring 1-0, 15 inning MINOR league baseball game than have to watch this again.  If i had a spoon within reach, i would gouge out my eyeballs instead of having to watch this ridiculous, awful film ever again.  Worst.....Film.......Ever!
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel really interested me. It was the first book in awhile that I just couldn't set down! The characters are all wonderful, but my favorite would have to be Moggot. His sarcastic and humerous ways lighten up the book a lot and gave me a good laugh. I love this book!
B0001HAISG|5.0|Holy cow that was a great movie! I don't think I can get enough of it! It was so spectacular...! My friends and I are even starting a site for it. The movie explained everything so well, and was actually better than the book. The chemistry between Hook and Wendy was freaky-cool, and the only fault the movie had was Tink's jerky moves. It was super great and is totally underrated for the classic that it truly is!
B00005Q4CS|1.0|Sure to make you want to turn the director upside down and shake him to get your money back. I honestly think this jack ass director only made this movie to degrade poor Jennifer Connelly. There is no point to this sadistic trash. Scenes of shooting up into an arm with gangrene that is eventually sawed off, Prostitution, vomiting, electro shock, stabbings, shootings and infantile over use of camera tricks insures bad times. No story or plot here. zero stars.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|When I watched the trailer for this movie I was left with mixed feelings, on one side I wanted to see it just because it was directed by Tim Burton, but on the other side, what I saw seemed too fantastic for my liking. Luckily, my wife was desperate to watch this film, so I was &quot;forced&quot; into watching it soon after the date of its release in DVD. I say luckily because the story is mesmerizing and the fantastic elements are fun and add a certain charisma to the film.<br />Will (Billy Crudup) is tired of listening to his father tell stories over and over and being the center of attention in every gathering. When at Will's wedding, Edward (Albert Finney/Ewan Mc Gregor) repeats his annoying behavior by retelling the story for the nth time of how he caught a big fish, Will gets extremely angry and they get into a confrontation. This leads to three years of silence between father and son, which is only broken when Edward gets seriously ill and the doctors have no hope left for him.<br />Will goes back with his parents' house and we get immersed into the different stories Edward told through the years, from a witch that showed him how he was going to die, to the time when he started growing extremely fast and had to spend three years in bed as a result. As the stories pile up, the son finally starts to understand who his father is and to appreciate that which has bothered him for so long.<br />Tim Burton leads us through a labyrinth of myths and legends, with skillful storytelling and scenes that will make even the toughest of you feel emotional and maybe drop a tear or two. It is definitely I movie I recommend everyone to watch!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|The people bashing this CD obviously don't listen to anything but Metal, because they can't see past the fact that there are some soft songs on this CD to realize how good it is. If its not heavy at all times it must be bad....WRONG!<br />This CD is freaking amazing. The musical complexity and the layers of sound are incredible. It is still VERY MUCH Slipknot, its just a different taste of them. I admit, when I heard an acoustic guitar on the 6th track, I thought, &quot;WTF is this?&quot; But then I listened to the song and realized it was a good song. It's kind of like if I gave you a bottle and told you it was full of Pepsi, then you drank it only to find out it was Lemonade. You spit it out because it wasn't what you were expecting, but that doesn't mean it isn't good.<br />In my opinion, Corey was screaming way too much on Iowa and it didn't fit with the music. It sounded like &quot;well im in a metal band, so I have to scream and sound pissed.&quot; The screaming sounded forced. Not to mention lyrics like &quot;if your 555 then im 666&quot; sounds like they are trying too hard. I love that song, but I couldn't help but laugh when I heard it. On their self-titled disc, the music was a lot more focused on beats and rhythms, including catchy spoken work type lyrics. I feel thats something that they returned to on the Subliminal Verses. They also incorporate other instruments and sounds that bring good songs to greatness. It's hard to take metal and bring in electronics and strings and make it all sound cohesive...Slipknot did a great job at this.<br />Overall, this is an excellent CD. I agree, I could have done with a 1 or 2 less softer songs, but don't let that stop you from realizing the quality work Slipknot put together here.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril's first cd called Let Go was a great album, there were many things I could relate to, but I enjoy her second cd I cant stop listening to it and cant help but turn it up soo loud, its different from her first album, much more angrier but i like it.  Its not as poppy. Awsome CD I really reccomend it.
B00000IGGA|1.0|AFTER MANY YEARS OF SMOKING AND DRINKING, THE AFFECTS ARE SO CLEAR THRU THE PASSAGE OF TIME, TOM HAS LOST HIS VOICE.  THIS CD WAS SO POORLY CONFIGURED AND EXECUTED THAT THE SINGER SOUNDS AS IF HE IS CRAWLING OUT OF THE GRAVE!  HE SOUNDS WORSE THAN LEONARD COHEN THESE DAYS!  I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYING, OR CARE TOO.  THE MUSIC IS JUST PLAN AWFUL AND LACKS ANYTHING ORIGINAL.  HIS EARLIER WORKS ARE SO SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Ok, this album is different and what is the problem??! This is a very good album with a great evolution...
B00005JMFQ|4.0|But it was released at Christmastime, has a holiday theme, a feel-good montage at the end... of course it's a little schmaltzy. On the other hand, it's a lovely romantic comedy in the Bridget Jones/Four Weddings and a Funeral tradition -- even complete with Hugh Grant proving he just can't shake that adorably pink-cheeked thing he has, whether he's playing the shy young fellow, the basta*d boyfriend, or the Prime Minister.<br />But -- it's not *just* a chick flick. Okay, the Keira Knightly plot and the Colin Firth bit, that was all pretty standard. Liam Neeson gave a wonderful performance but his girl-obsessed yet oddly-not-mourning-his-mum son was a bit off. Still, how many feel-good movies can boast the inclusion of a couple who meets while simulating sex, a sex-crazed fellow who finds bliss in Milwaukee, an oddly warming story about an over the hill rocker, and Emma Thompson, glorious in her non-gloriousness?<br />So, yes, of course it has the obligatory soundtrack, the corny moments, the schmaltz at the end. There are also quite a few funny bits along the way. Personally, I'm adding this one to the holiday repetoire, for annual enjoyment.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Until this CD came out, I have never heard of this talented young lady. Earlier this week, I saw an episode of her show &quot;Still Standing&quot; in which she sang the CD's opening (and beautifully arranged) track &quot;Summertime&quot; at the end...that alone made me want to sample the album.<br />It's wonderful to hear someone as young as Renee breathing new life into a collection of great songs, most of which we have had the pleasure of enjoying for years. David Foster (co-producer) deserves praise for helping to bring her remarkable talent to the record-buying public.<br />With careful handling, Renee can look forward to enjoying a long and successful career in the years ahead.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Daring it its successful attempt to capture J.M. Barrie's timeless story in a live action film, P.J. Hogan has created a masterpiece with his 2003 version of Peter Pan.  Promising to be a Peter like you've never seen before, this Pan delivers action, mystery, drama, romance, and adventure.  We are first introduced to the Darling house and a special girl named Wendy who is on the verge of childhood to womanhood.  After learning she must grow up, she luckily meets Peter who comes frequently to hear her adventure stories of Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and of course Peter Pan.  Needless to say, Wendy and her brothers run off-or shall I say fly off- with Peter Pan to the magical Neverland world in which one never grows up.  There they meet the Lost Boys, who are in desperate need of a mother, and have adventures with Tiger Lily and the infamous Captain James Hook, captain of the Jolly Roger.  However, this Hook is not the typical goof he is played out to be.  A tasteful dresser and fearful villain, Jason Isaac's puts all other Hook's to shame.  Remarkably, this Hook seems to be a decent match for the carefree spirit of Peter Pan.   <br />But appearances are deceiving in the world of Neverland; where eerie mermaids who's deadly sirens lure you to your doom and where fairies dances enchant you with a spell.  Since this movie is based on the book, the depth and darkness of Barrie's tale shines through and naturally there is a romance between Peter and Wendy.  Their \\"feelings\\" are explored in a beautiful fairy dance and a magical \\"thimble\\" or kiss, in the end.  Unfortunately for Peter, his desire for not wanting to grow up does not let him pursue his Wendy.  Moreover, the dialogue in the movie is cleverly used, especially many lines from Captain Hook.  The cinematography and props team worked overtime because the scenery and vivid colors were a sight to remember in addition to James Newton Howard's musical score.  <br />But my favorite thing about Peter Pan is how we get to see the story through Wendy's eyes.  She wants Peter, she would secretly like to be a pirate, and she wants to be treated equally and not like a \\"girly.\\"  She is the only female in Neverland and is not afraid to be a swordwoman or fight pirates and fly high in the pink frosted clouds. She is also not afraid to explore her feelings with Peter Pan- the boy who never wants to grow up.  All in all- a great adventure. One that I cannot forget. <br />Me? Forget? ...Never. :)
B0001UL7RY|4.0|When Avril Lavigne burst onto the scene two years ago with \\"Let Go\\" and it's accompaning radio-deluged songs like \\"Complicated,\\" \\"Sk8ter Boi\\" and \\"I'm With You\\" she was touted to be the new model of teen agnst. Part of the reason that she still had success was not only because the young could identify with the image she had, her music was also catchily enjoyable to listen to. <BR>Her second album has continued that formula albiet in to a varying degree. She brings to arm her anger but also has an introspective soul, covering issues such as abstiance, loss, revenge, obsession and lost love. But in doing so, the magical touch of the music that was present on her first album is somewhat diminished.<BR>While this album is fun to listen to, there is not a single song on here that has the instant hook that was on her first album. The first time we heard \\"Complicated\\" two years ago we knew this was something different. Now we get a very diluted version with the first single \\"Don't Tell Me,\\" a song that manages to cover the issue of abstaining from teen sex in a time when teen pregnancies are on the rise. A touchy issue that comes across well lyrically but again, musically is brings back to much of \\"Complicated.\\" <BR>Lavigne borrows too much of popular acts to be called innovative - \\"Take Me Away\\" and \\"Together\\" are rockers that instantly recall the sounds of Evanecense, \\"He Wasn't\\" is another fast paced version of \\"He Wasn't\\" and some of the slower songs like \\"Forgotten,\\" How Does It Feel\\" and Slipped Away\\" fade into the background upon repeated listenings. Not because an important messege is not there - Slipped Away deals with the absolute loss that can be found only in death - but because the music fails to bring them to the level that needs to be there to catch someone's ear and ingrain them in their memory.<BR>Indeed, the brightest moment on the entire album was the opening notes of \\"Who Knows\\" with it's melodic keyboard/guitar chords, and it seemed as if that was theone song that was going to go somewhere new and exciting, and dare I saw musically emotive. Sadly, with the chorus came yet another run of the mill upbeat messege but totally uoriginal anthemic songs.<BR>Still, it does stand out as a potential hit, as do the mid-tempo guitar driven \\"Nobody Home\\" and \\"Fall To Pieces,\\" the latter of which is lyrically a carefully disguised anthem about obession. Finally the other songs that will have the most likelihood of gaining airplay are \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and the most melodic song on the album, the upbeat and overall best song on the album, \\"My Happy Ending\\".<BR>This is a good album, from a good artist, and she is still young in her career. Hopefully with development she will be able to sucessfully combine the memorable music from her first album with the innovative lyrics from her second. But for now, she is not quite there yet.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|so, this band is still alive, huh? i've never been a fan of slipknot, when i first heared them i thought they're too noisy(that's totally true), but i do enjoy TRUE HEAVY BANDS suck like Deicide, Death, Suffocation, Dying Fetus etc. slipknot is truely crape. wearing masks and beating the carp out of each other on  stage can't make their music listenable. If you want ture heavy music, check out Suffocation's new stuff Soul To Deny, if you want rap metal, check out rage against the machine, if you want mosh music, check out S.O.D's Speak English or Die. the bottom line is, if you want some listenable music, check out Justin Timberlake.<br />and by the way, i wanted to give negative star, but there isn't anything like that, so, well.
B000060P79|2.0|ok ill admit it i used to LOVE this cd....... but then i bought a NOFX cd and thats of course real punk.... I think that if ur a screaming 8 year old ull love this cd. but if ur not dont even waste ur money go and buy the distillers new cd.... now that deserves 5 stars!or buy anti flag just if u own this cd... quickly go and crush before it kills ur cd player. and if u actually like this cd.. OMG thats gross to even think about!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I have to admit it...I LOVED This movie...Maybe it is a \\"chick\\" movie; maybe it borders on schmaltz and sentimentality..who cares?  Richard Curtis has crafted a movie that is wonderfully entertaining, peopled it with an outstanding list of well known and not so well known actors, set it at Christmastime, and I had a smile on my face almost the entire movie.  This is brilliant film-making.  I even enjoyed the deleted scenes!!!<br />BILL NIGHY & GREGOR FISHER - Bill is outstanding as the has-been rock star who wants his new unabashedly awful Christmas song to be the # 1 song for the holidays.  He is rude, crude, potty mouthed, obnoxious, but ultimately loveable.  His relationship with his manager Joe (Fisher) culminates in a wonderfully tender scene where Billy admits his love.<br />COLIN FIRTH & LUCIA MONIZ as Jamie and his Portuguese housekeeper are a delightful pair, whose descent into love is touching, poignant and humorous.  The scene where Firth proposes and the whole town joins in is cinematic hoodoo, but what fun it is!<br />LIAM NEESON & THOMAS SANGSTER - this is Liam's finest work since SCHINDLER'S LIST.  His recently widowed stepdad to Sangster's brilliantly precocious Sam is a highlight of the movie.  Tender, warm, and extremely funny at times.  Sangster's love for his schoolmate Joanna is so representative of young puppy love.<br />EMMA THOMPSON & ALAN RICKMAN - Thompson is superb; her scene alone in the bedroom without one word of dialogue reflects the kind of actress this lady is.  Rickman is good too as the husband tempted by his lucscious secretary (played very well by Heike Makatsch).<br />LAURA LINNEY & RODRIGO SANTORO have the less uplifting relationship.  She is a hard working woman who feels responsible for her mentally ill brother, who is institutionalized, paranoid and schizophrenic.  Rodrigo is the office nerd who is really quite a stud and when he and Linney finally get a chance to express their feelings, phone calls from her brother interfere.  Linney is a brilliant actress and she does wonders with this difficult role.<br />HUGH GRANT & MARTINE MCCUTCHEON - Hugh is at home in this movie, even improbably cast as the Prime Minister.  But Hugh is Hugh, and his dashing aplomb and carefree masculinity match the torrid undercurrent of McCutcheon's Natalie.  His putdown of President Billy Bob Thornton is marvelous.<br />MARTIN FREEMAN & JOANNA PAGE - what a hoot!  Here we have two young people who are standins for sexual scenes of some movie, and they talk about the weather, the Prime Minister and all other kinds of things while in very compromising positions.  Quite original and well played.<br />KRIS MARSHALL is Colin, a self-proclaimed stud who ventures off to America to find babes.  One would think that he would turn out luckless, especially since he chooses to go to Wisconsin.  But true to Curtis' originality, Colin scores right away with not one, but four luscious babes.  Charming.<br />KEIRA KNIGHTLEY and ANDREW LINCOLN - she's recently wed to Lincoln's best friend, and for all intents and purposes, it looks like he resents the marriage.  We all know of course the real reason for his behavior.  Wonderfully played out by these two charming actors.<br />There are so many wonderful scenes in this movie, and the entire cast is sublime and perfect!<br />I didn't think I would like this movie at first, but it is one of my favorite movies I've seen in some time.<br />Forget the schmaltz, just enjoy the company!!!ey is a brilliant actress and she does wonders with this difficult role.<BR>HUGH GRANT & MARTINE MCCUTCHEON - Hugh is at home in this movie, even improbably cast as the Prime Minister.

0385510438|2.0|Ok I am not saying this is a bad book - it does hold your attention and there is a little twist at the end but it is just not what I have come to expect from Grisham.  I expect more law talk, suspense and action - this bordered on Chick Lit.  There is nothing wrong with talking about people's feelings but that should be in a book by Danielle Steele not Grisham.

B00020HEG6|5.0|Wow! John Williams has done it again - he's had a break for a year and now he's back better than ever!! This new harry potter score is so inventive and new, and it will definetely go great with the film. Tracks such as &quot;The Knight Bus&quot; will just amaze you as it is unlike anything John Williams has ever chosen to do before. All Of the New Themes are beautiful and John Williams seems to be particularly inspired when it comes to writing music for flying, ;-). If you have liked any of John Williams scores then you just HAVE TO buy this soundtrack, and that's that!!
006092988X|5.0|Shortly after reading this book, I have come to realize why A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, is considered a true literature classic.  The story illustrates a beautiful picture of Brooklyn, New York during the turn of the twentieth century, and the types of lifestyles the working poor lived.  The story is focused on the life of Francie and Neely Nolan, the children of a sweet but heartbreaking couple, Katie and Johnny Nolan.  The mother, Katie Nolan, is brutally honest, never one to publicly express emotion or sugar-coat things for her family or friends.  The father, Johnny Nolan, is a charming young man who serves as the backbone for the family, but has a terrible problem: alcoholism.  Smith gives some of the most common problems of children, yet is able to elaborate on them to develop the characters and give the reader a real understanding of them.  For young Francie and Neely, their lives are subject to poverty, and they soon learn how valuable every cent is.  As poor children growing up in a rural neighborhood, they learn to cope with teasing of their social status and their given situation in life.<BR> With the sudden death of Johnny, the family learns to cope with an even tougher life, and the story begins to unfold.  It begins to tell of the physical and emotional changes of Francie as she grows older, and her trials and tribulations as she goes from a successful student to a vulnerable factory worker.  As life goes on for this family, we begin to sympathize for it, and come to gain respect for all that they must pull together for to get through whatever life throws their way.<BR> Not only will the story appeal to the reader, but also the writing style that Betty Smith takes on.  The setting descriptions that she gives of the beautifully constructed buildings, blooming flowers, passers-bys, and the whirlwind of life that Francie is observing are amazing and cause the reader to have an early fondness for the book.  Imagery also plays another part in the development of the characters and the story.  You could feel the warmth of the sun beating down through the windows of the bakery Francie made multiple visits to for cheap, day old bread.  You could smell the coffee that Katie had brewed the day before, and tasted the freshly cut rye bread to go along with it. <BR> Through the experiences Smith put the characters in, and the development of the tale of this unfortunate family, the reader is able to understand that many endless themes and messages are interwoven within the story.  Hope, survival, and courage are all included with these themes, and are illustrated through the way that Francie and Neely live their everyday lives.  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is a book recommended for any classic collection, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by people everywhere.  This heartwarming story is sure to touch all hearts of those who read it, and will give them a new view on life, and how lucky they are to live in the world they do today.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|After seeing the first Matrix I knew I had to see the second. Reloaded brings so many new questions and new ideas that the mind could go on arguing what is going on for hours. It's action packed with more Kung Fu than the last and the digital effects are awesome. Not to mention the most suspenseful scene I have ever seen! (The Freeway of course) The script is just incredible. Most people know the The Matrix is about Birth-The second, Reloaded, is about life and what the people of Zion and the main characters of the movie go through. The entire trilogy one can sit with and debate hours over without getting bored. This movie I could watch over and over again.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Yes, it is true.  Slipknot's newest album &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)&quot; is a much more different album than any other that has been created by this band of nine talented individuals who fight their demons through music.  The album is not as heavy or brutal as &quot;Slipknot&quot; or &quot;Iowa,&quot; but the darkness and edge is still very much there.  While I understand that this album will most likely make some fans angry or disappointed, I have to admit that I really love this new album--and this is coming from someone who loved &quot;Iowa&quot; a lot more than their self-titled album.<br />This new album is a unique experiment.  The band has taken their music to a new level and has expanded on each of their contributions to the project.  This album is a much more melodic and haunting album than the past two.  Corey does a little more singing on this one, but he in no way has forgotten to yell and scream like a man possessed by a dark power.  They have found ways to create memorable and dark songs that will stay in your head for days without just merely yelling out a bunch of curse words in a row (which I find nothing wrong with at all, but it's nice to see a change).  There are heavy songs, and there are more mellow songs.  And, there are also sick and twisted songs with lyrics that will rattle inside your mind once you allow them in.  Rick Ruben did a fine job producing this overwhelming work of musical bliss.<br />Does this album sound like a Stone Sour album?  I couldn't disagree more.  I've heard both bands, and trust me, THIS is Slipknot.  Anybody who is worried that the band has gone soft should listen to or read the lyrics in &quot;the virus of life&quot; and &quot;vermilion,&quot; which are probably the two most disturbing songs on the album--and yes, they're done without any profanities, which makes it all the more disturbing!<br />This is another album where I can pop it into the stereo and just let it play all the way through without worrying about skipping certain tracks.  I have my favorites, of course, but I really enjoy the entire album.  The ones that stick out to me the most are, &quot;the blister exists,&quot; &quot;three nil,&quot; &quot;duality,&quot; &quot;before I forget,&quot; &quot;circle,&quot; &quot;vermilion,&quot; &quot;pulse of the maggots,&quot; &quot;vermilion pt. 2,&quot; &quot;welcome,&quot; and &quot;the virus of life.&quot;<br />It's certain that the album has lost some fans along the way, kept some old ones, and gain some new ones.  With change--not the album, but just change in general--comes frustration and disappointment, as well as excitement and satisfaction.  It is just a fact of life.  If you really think about it, the band has evolved with each album.  They evolved with &quot;Iowa,&quot; and now they have even further evolved with &quot;Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses).&quot;  People who are expecting to hear the Slipknot from &quot;Iowa&quot; will most likely be disappointed.  The best approach to this album is to listen to it with an open mind, allow the album to play all the way through once, let it all soak in for an hour or so, and then listen to it again.  I can honestly say that I think this is Slipknot's most creative and risky album.  While it's not certain that it is my absolute favorite by them as of yet, it is an album that I have grown to love more and more after each listen. -Michael Cranerying about skipping certain tracks.

B000002KFJ|5.0|The opener here, &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; cannot be faulted. The obligatory instrumental follows (all 49 seconds!), providing a wonderful intro to what I believe (yes, maybe it is better than Sabbath Bloody Sabbath) to be Black Sabbath's finest moment - &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot;, outstanding. Listening to this track you are hearing Black Sabbath at their zenith. THe following track &quot;Megalomania&quot; is a great Sabbath track, a good rock standard, but listening to their catalogue chronologically, you will never hear the band top the heights of &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot; again, although &quot;The Writ&quot; comes close, as does &quot;The Thrill of it All&quot;. Supertzar is an interesting instrumental track, with its backing choir, different to the usual little geear ditties. &quot;Am I Going Insane?&quot; is a good song, but not by Black Sabbath standards, and points the direction that the next two albums were to take.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Im a musician...and im very open to all styles of music....and im a big Avril fan!....she writes very catchy songs that are enjoyable to listen to.....i dont understand the haters who gave this album a bad rating...even rolling stone magazine gave this album a great review.  Avril never claimed to be PUNK.....shes Pop...and says it....and shes done a great job on &quot;under my skin&quot;<BR>Every song on the album is worth a listen...its a bit short of an album....but its def still worth the purchase! i bought 5...u could at least buy one....u wont regret it !
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is my favorite movie. I haven't enjoyed anything more, and it is truly a wonderfully entertaining work of art. If you haven't at least rented it, please do, and as soon as you can. Great film. Great Great Film.
B000007MVL|5.0|The thing I have noticed the most especially from American fans of Kate Bush is that they don't get \\"Lionheart\\" as one reviewer succintly put it.<BR>True,Kate Bush has always been the most English of all English singers.Her looks and her voice recall the windy wily moors of Northern England,the lush greenery of the English countryside,the dark eroticism of English manors,and nowhere is this more apparent than in the brilliant \\"Lionheart\\".<BR>Hammer Horror is about a plot by an understudy to kill a play's main protagonist to steal the part from her or him for that matter.Hammer refers to the venerable Hammer Studios who produced all the Dracula and Vampire movies in Britian from the 50's to the 70's.<br />Coffee Homeground is another song about murder ,its 19th century atmosphere is amzingly produced and nowhere else is Kate Bush's voice more eerie.<br />Oh England My lionheart is a true classic in both lyrics and performance.You can actually feel the aching in Kate's voice as she vows her love for her country.In the hands of any other artist this song could have been a syrupy mishmash but with Kate Bush,it's a strong declaration of love without being aggressively patriotic.<br />Kashka from Baghdad is a sympathetic story of 2 gay men who even though shunned by their friends and families for being gay don't care because as the landlady can clearly see every night under the moonlight,they are deeply in love and obviously oblivious to what the world thinks of them.You can hear in Kate's voice her longing to join them.I find this to be typical of Kate's sensual persona.<br />And by the way ,Kate has always tackled taboo subjects long before it became fashionable to do so.How many of you know that the song \\"Moving\\" from The Kick Inside is about orgasm??
B0001WTUH6|5.0|I love this DVD. I had the original release but had to buy the unrated version. Totally worth it just for the comic book and sketch booklet alone.
B000002ORU|3.0|As a Who fan, I would recommend getting the box (BUT NOT at full price), it does not compare to the 4 CD Zeppelin set for example. I like the rarities and live stuff &quot;My Wife&quot; stands out, but I am no fan of remixes: For exanple: The edited version of &quot;Who Are You?&quot; You are much better off getting &quot;Who Are You?&quot; where you get two different versions of it, PLUS &quot;Had Enough&quot; (Perhaps the most unappreciated Who song ever).<BR>   I think that ANY Who fan is better off with the &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;, a much better set BOTH for content and money. That is a great set, this is simply good.
0743454529|5.0|Jodi Picoult has written a heartwrenching story of a family's struggle to deal with the illness of one of their own.  We get an intimate view of just how devastated a family can be by such a terrible disease.  Sixteen year old Kate has leukemia and her younger sister, Anna, who was basically created to be a donor for her sister, has reached the tender age of 13 and is sick of feeling like she may as well be sick herself given all the time she is spending in the hospital donating parts of her body to  Kate.  Enter Jesse, the angry older brother who is dealing with the hurt he feels inside by &quot;acting out&quot; as a juvenile delinquent.  We feel such sympathy for Sara and Brian as they try to hold onto their sick daughter with such fierce devotion, possibly, to the detriment of their other children.  <br />Ms. Picoult does a wonderful job bringing the reader into the heart of this struggling family.  I felt such empathy for all of them and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I recommend it highly.
0452282152|5.0|This was the first novel by Tracy Chevalier I had read and I love her writing.  This story about the famous painting is so imaginative and intriging. I have since bought a copy of the portrait and also enjoyed the movie.  Her other novel-  The Virgin Blue is very good as well.  I especially would recommend Falling Angels- the book is by chapters of each character's point of view.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I know alot of people have been bashing this cd, so I decided to write a reveiw of my own. Though this cd is like nothing else they have made it is still good. The guitars actully are good on this cd, there is cool drums, and they vocals are soft and clean. Now don't listen to this expecting a cd like &quot;Iowa&quot; listen to it with an open mind.
B0001WTUH6|2.0|The movie Underworld was a good movie, granted not the gothic Blade meets Romeo and Juliet that it was billed to be, but it had solid action, a decent story and great effects.  Yet they have seen fit to re-release the movie with additional footage, not a bad idea, when the footage adds to the story, like with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the added footage there is noticeable, enriches the story and let's face it is just plain cool.  But I digress, this &quot;added footage&quot; that they are making a great stink over is not even noticeable, there were times when I thought something looked a bit different, like a camera angle, or the way lines were delivered, but it was vaguely noticeable and easily forgotten about within two minutes.  There is no added footage here that enriches the plot, deepens the story, high ten's the senses or just plain makes you go &quot;WOW&quot;.  The footage, in fact, is so unnoticeable I honestly thought there was a 14min epilogue added, and I kept checking the counter on my DVD player to see if the movie was indeed any longer.  The bottom line, if you own this movie already, don't buy it again, if you don't own it, buy the cheaper version if you must have it, because you wouldn't notice a thing different between the two, and lastly (for you movie directors/ producers / or studio executives) if you intend on releasing a movie on DVD and then almost a year later re-release it because you've added or reworked footage, make damn sure it's noticeable and stop wasting our(the consumer's) time and money.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Imagine if you will the average Slipknot fan. In 1999 you were treated to the self-titled album, claimed by many as one of the greatest records of all time. Two years later, IOWA, a beautiful piece of metal masterpiece was released two weeks before September 11th. Without question, the post 9/11 world had no room for \\"I wanna slit your throat and **** the wound.\\" <br />Then there is Vol. 3. Before you can judge any record, in my opinion, you have to completely forget that the other records exist. The Self-titled record is WAY different than IOWA, and such is the case with Vol. 3. From the moment the beginning track begins, you know you've heard a new Slipknot. Is this bad?<br />Not at all.<br />Contrary to one reviewer, \\"Circle\\" is quite gorgeous and original given the sound effects in the background as Corey sings in 3-part harmonies. To hear Slipknot play an acoustic song is ground-breaking in itself. The heavy songs are very awesome as well. \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\" is sure to replace \\"Surfacing\\" as the new Slipknot anthem, \\"Welcome,\\" \\"Duality,\\" and \\"Vermillion\\" are the stand out tracks.<br />The choruses of this record are definitely something to write home about. Unlike the chorus of \\"Disasterpiece,\\" and \\"New Abortion,\\" Vol 3 comes stocked with sing-along choruses that are perfect for live performances and such. <br />The first time I heard this record, I wasn't too fond of it to be honest. I was waiting for \\"People=Sh*t\\" or \\"Spit It Out\\" but the 2nd time through, the beauty of the record really does shine. The sharp, ragged edges of previous Slipknot records is still there. It is still chaotic, it still doesn't hold back, but Vol 3. is perhaps Slipknot's most detailed record. You can actually HEAR the samples, the percussion, the bass guitar, and the back up vocals. <br />With that said, I think this album is amazing. Go pick it up. If you are a Slipknot fan simply because of the chaotic metal they made before, you will be surprised, but I hope that it will be apleasant one because this group has shown a lot of potential with this record, and I hope they continue it for years to come.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|WOW! avril's new album \\"Under my skin\\" is by far the best album of the year. listening to her songs, you can hear a more mature sound and a more grown up scence. in one song she curses by not even having a explcit label on the cd. i think that \\"Under my skin\\" is 2004's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" but even better than alanis. her new disc doesn't feature suggestive dancing, no hip-hop collaborations, no \\"sex you up\\" lyrics, just plain Avril! just plain great lyrics that more artist should sing about. her voice on this album is even more amazing then \\"Let GO\\" i never thought she could top her debut album but, i guess i was wrong, she did! this is more like a part 2 of \\"let go\\" but even better! you can hear each song over a hundred times and never get tired of listening to it, i can't get the cd out of my cd player.
B0001XAPX8|4.0|I would maybe watch this film 3 times at the most, it's interesting at times but 20 percent of it is pure drek, the other artsy and appeakling though...
B0001BKAEY|3.0|After reading all the negative reviews, and skipping out on its appearance at the local multiplex, I finally got a chance to sit down and view Revolutions in the comfort of my own home after receiving the DVD as a birthday gift.  Naturally, before even pressing play, I had a negative feeling about the film, and was somewhat skeptical as to what the Wachowski brothers were gonna throw my way.  <br />However, after viewing it, and letting it sink in a bit, I must say that the film is far better than I expected.  Mostly due to the pacing, which is much swifter than the middle installment.  While the 2nd film seemed to get caught up in its on existential and spiritual hokeyness, this film seemed to be quite a bit more balls to the wall action and straightforward in terms of plot.  Again, the acting leaves a lot to be desired (did anyone buy into Neo and Trinity's 'love'?), and there was the occasional talky nonsense, particularly in the scenes with the 'new' oracle.  But the Battle for Zion makes up for most of it, as does the final confrontation with Agent Smith.  I must say though, the ending leaves open quite a few questions and is somewhat open ended... but again, would you expect anything less?
0060934700|4.0|In &quot;Neverwhere&quot; Gaiman seriously bit off more than he could chew.  But in this book of short stories, Gaiman's intensely creative ideas and fantastic imagination are perfect for the art that is the short story.  I like how he puts two entirely unrelated ideas together.  Like his opening tale of an old woman who finds the Holy Grail at her local thrift shop and is pursued by a handsome Knight of the Table Round (Yes, somehow he is from the past) who desperately wants the cup so he can complete his quest.  You won't believe what he offers her in the way of exchange!  These stories are so cool, I highly recommend this book!
B00020HEL6|5.0|With a voice as nuanced and controlled as any jazz great, Renee Olstead is poised to take the music world by storm!  Her phrasing is perfect and the maturity is amazing for a 14 year old.<br />This disc of standards performed by Renee is sure to become a classic and I can't wait to hear more from this talented teen.  You have to hear it to believe it!
B00003CXFV|5.0|this amazing movie has touched my heart. based on a true story, it was made in to a motivating box office hit. with a small suply of heroes, this truly tells us what we can accomplish and what a difference we can make in any1z life. with memorable lines that you can remeber such as.. <BR>\\"They're called (...) Ed\\"<BR>\\"You want my number? How about this for a number, 6, that's the age of my daughter, 8 is the age of my son, 2 is the number of times I've been married and divorced and 16 is the number of dollars left in my bank account.\\"<BR>\\"Not personal? That's my work in there, my sweat, my time away from my kids ... if that's not personal I don't know what it is.\\"  <BR>I could just watch this movie over n over again...
0792101448|5.0|Sergio Leone made some good films.  This one has Henry Fonda as the bad guy, Frank, and Charles Bronson as &quot;Harmonica,&quot; with the stunningly beautiful Claudia Cardinale as a former lady of the evening who has the misfortune to marry a man who is murdered at the beginning of the story, Joe McBain, whom we never meet.<br /><br />Jason Robards plays a great part, as Cheyenne, a part with humor and character.<br /><br />Frank and his cohorts are after McBain's land.  Robards likes Cardinale, and Bronson is playing his own hand.  A good story, well played, with a great ending.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre,<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books
B0000C7GG2|5.0|Mix the melodious renderings of Radiohead, and the addictive beats of Nirvana, adding symphonious melodies and you have Muse.  Following the trend of their previous albums, Absolution creates a hybrid of a classical presence and powerful rock compositions, though the production of this album is takes a less industrial turn.  Their growth is apparent in the lilting and inviting rhythms that mix perfectly with Matthew Bellamy's voice, like in the mesmerizing ballad \\"Sing for Absolution.\\"  They have abandoned some of the more eclectic styles, allowing the classical and modern rock to meld rather than clash, creating an enigmatic production.<BR>A sign of their maturity as artists, the theme that resonates throughout the album is the desire to overcome inner struggles to find liberation.  The songs embody a series of life's big and little problems, becoming an anthem for each.  Every song creates its own world to enter, whether it be obsession, like the pompous electricity of \\"Hysteria\\", or indifference which comes from melancholy tunes like Blackout.  Lyrics like \\"Don't grow up too fast/ And don't embrace the past/ This life's too good to last/ And I'm too young to care\\" cannot be ignored, and personify the prevailing emotions, while it is the hypnotic music which leaves the lingering effects.<BR> What seems to be the heart of the album is \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes,\\" which is at once intimidating and inspirational.  This song with its provocative yet simple lyrics awakens the audience with Bellamy's voice that shifts from a wistful lullaby to a resounding operatic strain.  His vocal styles mixed with the fusion of dominant orchestral authority with intense rock music create a song that leaves the listener breathless.  <BR> Incorporating the spirit of Beethoven, and the innovation of such inspirations as Radiohead, Jeff Buckley and Nirvana, Muse brings the past alongside the present.  Hopefully if they continue to produce magic like this, they will live up to their name and inspire future musical generations with their unique style.  As for Absolution, I have walked away from it purged and thirsting for more.
0060254920|4.0|This book was very interesting and creative. Also this was a fun book to read for young and old because it had action, adventure, and drama. I liked this book alot when I was a kid because it was short, fun, clever. When you are a child you mostly like action or adventure.  This book had it all.  Very fun to read aloud and to yourself. My opinion on this book is that it was a great fun book.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|Okay, I have not really enjoyed any release from EC since From The Cradle... and it is really due to the fact that I feel EC is bored.<br />In an effort to conjure up some fire, it seems he went to the source of his inspiration, RJ.  Well, the only problem is, it sounds as if he is playing at RJ's funeral.  Blues is indeed, after all, sort of sad music, but I have heard it explained that blues is 'Sad music to make you happy' ... and I guess that is where this piece of work seems to lack a certain happy fire that blues deserves.<br />Don't get me wrong, it is not BAD, and the songs are brilliant songs, but they are just not brilliant here.  I like how EC does them, but he does not play them like his life is depending on it.. and that is how EC has played blues in the past.<br />There are some folks who are going to kill me for writing what I wrote, but keep in mind, it is just my opinion.<br />OVERALL, not a bad recording, not one song is bad.  Just not a 4 or 5 recording, that's all.<br />Riding with the King is a lot better.  The only stand out since From The Cradle.
B0000DC13U|1.0|The footage of the Stones' working sessions is great. I loved watching and listening to the metamorphosis of that great song. But Jean-Luc Godard's interspersed, incoherent &quot;cultural revolution&quot; playlets with the little pinball Love Grrl and the Black Panthers...I can't describe how utterly awful it is. There's something wrong with the fast-forward button on our dvd player remote, so I went to the tv and pressed the fast forward on the player to get through these parts after the first two bits. Needless to say, I ended up sitting in front of the player, a foot from the TV, so I wouldn't have to see any more of these parts. Won't somebody please edit this movie down to a great 15 minutes of Stones in session, please. I'd add a couple of stars for that.

B0001M0A4I|5.0|Tony Banks' &quot;Seven: A Suite for Orchestra&quot; is one of the best Romantic orchestral efforts by a formerly popular/rock music composer I have heard.  It has interesting, pleasant melodies, at times a spirit of grandeur and striving (&quot;Gateway&quot; and &quot;Neap Tide&quot; segments), and at times a spirit of hope and delight (&quot;Spirit of Gravity&quot; and &quot;Spring Tide&quot; segments), that conveys pure love of life to me.  It is most reminiscent of dramatic movie scores of the 1940s, or of adventure film scores by John Williams in recent years (&quot;The Ram&quot; segment). However, it is not at the high level of classical music by Brahms, Rachmaninoff or Tchaikovsky, of course.

B00004THAY|5.0|Okay.  I have just purchased the new Eric Clapton's CD called Me and Mr. Johson.  And boy, did I dislike that CD for its lack of inspiration.<br />I wrote a review of it.  Gave it a 3 star.<br />Then I got to thinking... when has EC made some decent music in the past ten or so years?  Well one recording is THIS ONE.<br />This recording has passion, great singing, and some fantastic interplay between two guitar players.<br />I totally enjoy every song, and perhaps the presence of BB KING EC found that he must be on good, inspired behavior since he does not sleep walk through this recording like he seemingly did on some others.<br />Another great recording to grab onto, From The Cradle.  Perhaps the best EC release in 20 years.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|*sighs*<BR>Reading these reviews makes me sick.  Young kids complaining how &quot;the heaviest band on earth&quot; went soft.  Perhaps if the only things you have ever listened to were in the Roadrunner catalog, in addition to Disturbed, Korn, ect, than maybe that statement is true.  But listeners of a diverse array of heavy music know that Slipknot was never so catastrophically heavy.  My point being is that I prefer good songwriting in favor of heavy for the sake of heavy, and this is what Slipknot delivers on this album (heavy doesn't automatically equate to good).  This band are actually trying NEW THINGS, this is what artists do, grow and evolve.  Personally I like where they are going.  Anyone that has seen this band live knows that their previous heaviness didn't translate to the stage anyway, they sounded like a confused mess.  Perhaps with this album they will be able to have a decent stage show.  Maybe Slipknot will get rid of all their 12-16 year old fans (moronic followers) with this album, and will simultaneously gain some actual respect in the music industry.  Not a bad tradeoff in my opinion.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|This stuff for Oscar? Maybe with the Marketing scale exist only in America. B.t.w. Wish I had a dad like that.<br />Dull conversation lack of intelligence, cliché after cliché, superficial mockery of Japanese, cheap feelings worthy of no sympathy... next time if the director wants to explore some \\"moment\\", or \\"self mental state\\", or \\"deep\\"/\\"subtle\\"/\\"sensitive\\"/whatever human loneliness, please go directly with a reality TV so the audience can at least know what they'll get.<br />For some viewers who give it 4 or 5 stars, you are entitled to your opinion. However, please stop patronize by saying \\"...oh, it's not for everyone, some people don't understand the movie, they don't get it...\\" Please bear in mind that there are many viewers who watched hundreds (if not thousands) of movies including tons of foreign movies, arty movies, there are many people who visited Japan many times, many who live in different foreign countries for years, (me for one), therefore people can tell between crap and gem. <br />Plus what are we supposed to get from a movie if we just want to be entertained, which is the ultimate purpose of movie. We like it or dislike it naturally.
B00005JM0B|1.0|This movie is riddled with inconsitencies, it's the same plot as T2 and the actors are pretty awful.<br />If you are thinking about buying this movie please do not get T2 if you must have one of them in the trilogy. The movie at some points does not make sense example the kid is holding the steering wheel but he never looks at the road. It's pretty awful.<br />rent it first you will see.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is an amazing show that has a great story and wonderful loveable characters. The score is amazing My favorite songs are for good which is an amazingly beautiful song all about friendship, Popular, i'm not that girl and what is this feeling. Kristin Chenoweth shows of her vibrado and does an amazing job at it she makes the show as great as it is. Idina Menzel is also very good. I would really reccomend going to see the show first and then buying the cd which is what you'll want to do after seeing it. You'll find yourself humming the tunes as you leave the theater.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|haha...amazing! i always wondered who muse was. and now i know. i actually AM a coldplay and radiohead fan, which is why i was attracted to &quot;time is running out&quot;, becoming obsessed with this song after only hearing it twice on the radio. i needed to find out who it was. big surprise- a band that derives its influences from the likes of thom yorke...delicious. i don't own this cd yet, but will buy as soon as humanly possible. i'm so happy. to have found them.
0380778556|3.0|I thought this was a pretty average book.  It could have been a lot better.  I didn't get into it after the first 150 pages because it was extremely boring and there were a lot of random things written in it that didn't need to be in the book because they didn't add to it at all.  I skipped a lot of paragraphs and even whole pages because I couldn't stand how boring it was.  But as it went on it got a lot better and I became much more interested.  It was a good story and must have taken a lot of thought to write.  But once in a while it was confusing and I sometimes had no idea what was going on.  But overall, I think that I liked it because it really wasn't too bad and I would have given it a five-star rating if it only was more interesting in the beginning.
B00018D44U|1.0|How could Norah, of all people, let us down like that? Me and my wife were enourmous fans of this blossoming young artist's debut album, and anxiously awaited the next one. But this is crap! It is pure country! That's okay, I guess, but this is taking it too far. We were hoping for another Come Away With Me.<BR>It makes me sick to think that artists like Norah don't give a hoot about their fans. They just do what they wanna do. Me and my wife feel like Metallica fans must have felt when the band turned alternative. Please, at all costs, stay away from this one. It is not worth anything.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|first of all, Slipknot is THE band that changed my taste in music. i believe all you people who are sayin that slipknot has sold out or whatever r retarded. what da hell do u want from slipknot? same boring formula over and over again? u expect slipknot to be super hardcore and just pursue 1 type of music? u guys r stupid. slipknot has matured. they are not young little kids who go out of control like idiots anymore. they have EVOLVED and this is a NATURAL PROGRESSION. u cannot expect bunch of 30-something yr olds to act like maniacs forever. they have changed and u jus gotta embrace them as how they r now. this album is not bad at all. of course it is not a masterpiece but it is enjoyable. if u want great drumming, u would love this. also if ur not dumb and open-minded, you would appreciate this change. all u stupid people sayin  this is album is &quot;crap, not hard enough, they r sell outs, they only care about money, blah bla bla...&quot; r, again, RETARDED. Look at Radiohead, did they stay the same for their whole career? hell no. change is necessary sometimes and slipknot has gone the right direction. i'm also happy with DJ Sid having more input in this cd. SLIPKNOT, ROCK ON! all u stupid people, go listen to britney spears; now that's REAL CRAP, not slipknot. u guys r just trippin hardcore
B0001NBMBC|5.0|My first exposure to this controversial band was back in the days of Wait and Bleed.  Even then, I remember thinking to myself, &quot;if only this ecclectic mix of hardcore and melody could be part of the whole album...wow!&quot;.  <br />What Slipknot has given us is just this:  balance.  The brutal energy does nothing but further highlight the beauty of the harmonies during the melodic parts, and the existance of melodic phrases goes on to make the hardcore sections sound more extreme than ever!  <br />In films, think of how much more effective a murder scene is, when set to the likes of Bing Crosby.  Relativity is key...and it just might have worked out for these boys from Iowa.
B00005O5CM|4.0|As a blonde myself, I really should have been offended by this feature-length blonde joke, but hey, this flick is first-rate fluff. Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) is a self-absorbed sorority president and fashion major who expects to marry her college sweetheart Warner (Matthew Davis).  When Warner dumps her because she isn't the perfect accompaniment to his expected Harvard Law degree (too much Marilyn Monroe and not enough Jackie Kennedy), her whole world crashes around her until the solution hits her:  Why doesn't she become the woman Warner wants by following him to Harvard Law School?  To Elle, who has a specialty in The History of Polka Dots, this seems like a no-brainer, and since she doesn't seem to know how to use her brain, the hilarity begins.  She manages to get into Harvard through a brazen video, great LSAT's (for which she actually studied), and by stunning every last member of the admissions committee.<br />Who cares about realism when you've got a clueless blonde mixing with over-achieving, nerdy law students?  The always popular Elle becomes the class outcast, with a tongue-tied, good-hearted manicurist (played memorably by Jennifer Coolidge) as her only friend.  Director Luketic deserves enormous credit for keeping Elle's core personality intact despite the intellectual transformation; the sight of her colorful iMac in the sea of charcoal gray laptops is pitch-perfect as a symbol of her increasing seriousness but unwillingness to give into the nerd culture.  In her sorority house, Elle is but one of many blondes.  At Harvard, she is an individualist.<br />This film is completely preposterous and doesn't care - that's the fun of it.  Although the eventual triumph of Elle is predictable, how she gets there is not, making this film enjoyable every step of the way.  The script is surprisingly smart for fluff and is a huge reason for the success of this extended blonde joke.<br />For mindless entertainment, you can't beat this film.  &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; is one of those guilty pleasures you might hate to admit having.  Remember, you can always watch it in the privacy of your own home where no one but your closest relatives can hear you laugh at the antics of Elle Woods.nde&quot; is one of those guilty pleasures you might hate to admit having.  Remember, you can always watch it in the privacy of your own home where no one but your closest relatives can hear you laugh at the antics of Elle Woods.

B000148KK2|5.0|I've been listening to Diana Krall for a couple of years now. I bought the CD &quot;Love Scene&quot; some while ago. No strings, just bass, gitar and Diana. I bought another record for my mom, it had string arrangements, but seemed descent. This has been typically Diana, hasn't it, a record for your mom. She has been somewhat overhyped. She is clever, but a bit too slick and easy. The Girls in the Other Room is, as I see it, is her first no-compromising album so far! This is GREAT musicmanship (is this an english word?). Diana performs with a feeling for the music that is both unique and admireable. I don't care much for many of her earlier albums, I find them too easy. This one I really enjoy. Her best so far!! What else do I like? Miles, Mingus, Monk, and not to forget Polly Jean!! And now: Diana Krall.
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great should be required reading for school administrators.  There are some striking concepts that make sense for school leaders.  First, it's not that Level 5 Leaders aren't ambitious or have self-interest, it's just that their primary ambition is for the success of the institution.  Humility and will (an unwavering resolve) are essential for Level 5 leadership.  One of the analogies of a Level 5 leader is \\"plow horse rather than show horse.\\"  Great leaders tend to come up from within the company, rather than a celebrity outsider.  <br />I found it interesting that Level 5 leaders tend to attribute their success to luck, not greatness within themselves.  This seems to contradict earlier thought wherein women were encouraged to stop attributing success to luck and to accept kudos for doing well.  In the past, it was thought women limited their acknowledgement of success by attributing it to sources outside of themselves.  <br />Another concept in the book that I strongly agreed with was to lead with questions.  This strongly concurs with what I believe about good leadership.  Companies that tend to ask open-ended questions and search out the \\"what if's\\" would seem to be positioned to capture market changes more quickly than companies that stride ahead on one path without considering options.  Cisco Systems seems to do this well and, as a result, didn't suffer in the same way as many of the other Silicon Valley companies.<br />It seems to me that Warren Buffet exemplifies Level 5 leadership.  He strikes me as a steady, methodical plow horse, rather than showy.  Collins also addresses the importance of mentoring others to eventually replace the Level 5 leader.  I wonder how easy or difficult it is for great leaders to mentor others?<br />Many school leaders typify Level 5 leadership; however, some are still are on the journey to get there.  I would encourage every school leader or emerging leader to add this book to their reading list this summer.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|I expected this to be an interesting romantic comedy, but it turned out to be more like a fast-paced television sitcom with a mish-mash of insignificant plots, none of which had any good characterisations. Good actors were wasted in their roles. this movie is so hackneyed, dull, stupid. the director has made movies like this 15 times already.. dont waste time and money on this one. not even worth renting.

The things that come together in this book make it quite the adventure.
B000002MY3|4.0|Let's face it: the singles became so huge, the filler was overlooked by almost all the fans of this album. But the singles are excellent. I think Head Over Feet is excellent. The secret song is also very very good. The best song on this CD is All I Really Want. It hints at the greatness to come on later albums. It's incoherent, out-of-control, and I love it. We all love Ironic. Anyone notice the irony inherent that there is NONE in a song called &quot;Ironic?&quot; But who cares? You Oughta Know, the song that launched Alanis, is a personal favorite. People rave about the going down in a theater line, but my favorite is &quot;and every time i scratch my nails down someone else's back i hope you feel it well can you feel it?&quot; Hand In My Pocket is happy-go-lucky, and You Learn tells us that no matter what, we can grow from experience. Even if the filler is overlooked, I really like Not The Doctor. Overall, it's not her best album, but it's better than most albums anywhere.

B00005JMUA|5.0|Tarantino found the perfect form for this film. Now that I've seen Vol. 2, I can say for sure that the split works perfectly well. And yes, sure, I would like to see it as a whole reunited film some day, but now I see that the 2 volumes strategy works in an entertaining and artistic way too.<br />I won't say much about plot. You can find that everywhere else. It's true that the first volume was all action, and this one is more of a complete films. It also makes the previous one even better, because now you see the substance behind all that virtuos action scene.<br />The final dialogue between The Bride and Bill is the great pay off. It puts the whole thing in a new perspective, and you'll find yourself liking that Bill a bit too. He is a tragic chraracter, as much as the Bride and the others. This is the great thing here, there is no good and bad side really. I mean, The Bride herself was one of them, and only motherhood made her change her ways. But think of O-Ren... She became what she was because of a tragic childhood, so she's a victim too. Everyone is a victim here, and everyone is a killer because of that... as a song I heard recently said \\"you become the monster / so the monster will not break you\\". Think of Vernita's daughter... she is a victim of The Bride too. She might want satisfaction some day, and if she killed Beatrix, no one could really object. Of couse, what maked Beatrix more human and closer to us is that she became a mother and that made her a real person, not only a roaring rampage killer. She trascended the killer she was, and almost pay with her life.<BR>And Bill... when he explains the reasons behind his actions, you'll find it hard not to simpathize at least in some ways with him. <br />All of this, plus the brilliant single-minded and virtuos directing (Tarantino has become a great director now; the great screenwriter is no surprise of course) make this one a milestone film.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Dang I have been reading a lot of Avril Hater reviews, and it fails to amaze me, something as incredible comes out like Under My Skin, and a lot of people act like they hate it. Unbelievable!! <BR>    I have just recieved Under My Skin, I admit with a little skeptism, but since I love Avril's first Cd \\"Let Go\\" I figured I would give this cd a try. I am very glad I did. Here are my reasons why<br />1. Take Me Away: This song hints the anger that Avril feels when a boyfriend is a complete jerk.  I commend you, Avril for releasing this track. 5/5<br />2. Together: Very catchy tune, the chorus could have been a little better, but it still gets stuck in my head. 4/5<br />3. Don't Tell Me: All I can really say is WOW!!!!  Finally someone releases a track that says \\"YOU CAN SAY NO\\" I love it. Maybe people will realize sex shouldn't be done with just anyone, but someone you truly love. 5/5<br />4. He Wasn't: Avril's sophmore \\"Sk8ter Boi\\", very catchy 3.5/5<br />5. How Does It Feel: I can totally relate, that's all I can say. 4/5<br />6. My Happy Ending: I love it, I am truly glad that this song is being released as the next single. I feel as if she stepped into my brain and picked apart each of my relationships, and wrote a song about them. 5/5<br />7. Nobody's Home: I love Evanescence, so to see Ben Moody's name in the byline, made me very happy. 5/5<br />8. Forgotten: Very Haunting in the melody. Makes up for the lyrics, even though they are great.  4/5<br />9. Who Knows: I love how the song makes you think it's gonna be slow, and then bam, pure Avril rock. I like it a lot 4/5<br />10. Fall To Pieces: I didn't like this track as much as the rest. To me it just wasn't catchy enough, and the lyrics are kinda off for the rest of this album. 2.5/5<br />11. Freak Out: Total head banger song. Love it. 4.5/5<br />12. Slipped Away: For anyone who has lost someone close to them (myself included) this song is definatly going to be a tearjerker.  I lost both my grandparents and 4 very close friends all within the last year, so this song has a very special meaning for me. Thank You Avril for helping ease my pain, slowly day by day.  6/5<br />           Over All I think that this album deserves the Five Stars I gave it. I would give it more, but I can't. I highly recommend this album to anyone who can truly enjoy music for what it really is worth.

0679777547|4.0|The Club Dumas is really a good and surprisingly fast read. I thought the story was clever and was certainly as dark as advertised. The upside includes excellent &quot;literaturesque&quot; prose and a wealth of knowledge about Dumas, his writings, The Three Musketeers, and arcane occult practices. My only critique is that I was a little disappointed that it was not written like the Dumas serials it is mostly about and had barely any action in it. To me the writing style was more like that of Hemingway for example. I was hoping for a good Dumas styled swashbuckling conclusion with maybe even a good sword fight but instead the ending was more or less flat. Had the ending had more of a confrontational and victorious &quot;good over evil&quot; conclusion it to me would probably have made Dumas quite proud -a homage to his writing and legacy. Instead the reader is left with a story and ending surrounding the world of Dumas and with characters reminiscent of Dumas' Three Musketeers, but certainly without the flair, style, and feel of Dumas' work. Though perhaps this was not the author's intent or cliche, he certainly had the opportunity to end his story much like the Dumas he centers his story around and did not take it. All in all a really good book and accurately billed as a &quot;beach book for intellectuals.&quot; I'd recommend this book as it is fun and interesting but to me could have ended better.

B00005RYKU|1.0|As much as I loved the film, I have to give this particular release one star because it suffers from RCE (the pathetic pseudoprotection supposed to prevent its playback outside R1 areas); to watch it, I had to switch my player's region from 0 to 1, which takes 6 key presses on my remote and is therefore time-consuming... all right, so it was not a real problem, but since RCE DVDs are universally boycotted, I feel this warning is in order.
B0000028UK|5.0|First I want to comment on the reviewer before mine. I totally agree with what you are saying. Pj, nirvana and AIC aren't the only bands out there. However, i disagree when you say that pearl jam don't break new grounds. Pearl Jam takes new steps in different directions with every album. Pearl Jam is so often put beside nirvana and AIC because they were all grunge bands, but I think Pearl Jam is more a straight rock and roll band that deserve your attention. And this album is a good place to start.<br />This album is a classic, however it is living in the shadow of the commercial success album 'ten'. Vs sold almost 1 million copies in its first week of release. Back then, they counted 5 days as one week, making vs selling that many copies in only 5 days. Today, N'sync own the record, however, today they count all 7 days of the first week of sale. Even N'sync needed more than 5 days to beat this . Therefore the record still belongs to pearl jam in a way!<br />On to the album. <BR>The first 2 songs are go and animal,both fast rockers that an be frustrating in the first listens. <br />Daughter - Pearl Jam's first acustic song. This song is great and recieves a lot airplay on the radio. <BR>Glorified G - A fairly straight rocker with a great solo at the end. They seem to have fun.<BR>Dissident is the albums first masterpiece. A great riff with soaring lyrics and a powerful voice by Eddie. <BR>WMA - A hard first listen. It features a cool drumbeat and a haunting Eddie. The song is great and you will grow to love it. <BR>Blood - This song is heavy and craaazy with eddie screaming his loungs out for 3 minutes.<BR>Rearviewmirror - The albums second masterpiece! WOW, this song was the song that got me into pearl jam. Watch out for the finale of the song, magnificent stuff! <BR>Rats - A cool song with great bass! <BR>ELderly woman behind the counter in a small town - the albums third masterpiece. This is a concert favourite and with good reasons. The song is acustic with Eddie singing about fate. Its one of those songs everyone likes. Very catchy to be pearl jam. <BR>Leash - a rocker that was written on the road during the ten tour. Fast and heavy. Nuff said! <BR>NOW comes the greatest piece of music that has ever been recorded.<BR>Indifference - First time I heard this song I was recovering from a major hangover and I started to cry. Talk about a simple, yet POWERFUL song. Eddie's voice is so good on this track, it's unmatchable. If you don't buy this album, at least do yourself a favour and listen to this track. It an't be described in words. Only Eddie can.<br />So there you go, A great rock album with plenty of rock and many different styles. If you want to check pearl jam out (which is something you definately should do)get this album or 'ten'. Can't recommend them enough!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Seems like all the rock bands that were big in the 1970's HAD to have a live recording released. Deep Purple, Rush, Kiss, Foghat, Aerosmith, Cheap Trick and Peter Frampton all had classic 'live' performances recorded and released with much success (okay, maybe with the exception of Aerosmith's \\"Live-Bootleg\\"). But the die-hard rock fans and followers of a one Michael Schenker know that 1978's \\"Strangers In the Night\\" by UFO is one 'live' rock gem that has stood the test of time decades later. With perhaps UFO's most consistent album (\\"Obsession\\") coming out the same year, it baffles me that in 1979 and into the 1980's that UFO was not a bigger band and more of a household name. Phil Mogg was a very unique singer, and the rest of UFO (including one of my favorite drummers, Andy Parker) were all talented musicians. Schenker was (and still is decades later) a god on the guitar. I truly wonder if the fans back in the late 1970's knew they were watching brilliance in a teenage Michael Schenker. All the classic tracks are here... including \\"Doctor Doctor\\", \\"Lights Out\\", \\"\\"Rock Bottom\\", \\"I'm A Loser\\", \\"Love To Love\\", \\"This Kids\\", etc. UFO's best albums are well represented on \\"Strangers In The Night\\" taking 2-4 songs from each album - \\"Force It\\", \\"Lights Out\\", \\"No Heavy Petting\\", \\"Obsession\\", \\"Phenomenon\\". The remastered sound is crisp and this new release contains 2 bonus tracks - \\"Hot 'N Ready\\" and \\"Cherry\\". Please also note that the track listing here on Amazon is incorrect (Track #1 should be \\"Hot 'N Ready\\", #2 \\"Cherry\\", #3 \\"Let It Roll\\", #4 \\"Love To Love\\", #5 \\"Natural Thing\\", etc. I would rate this live release in my top 5 'live' rock albums ever... this is an easy pick. This is one recording were the songs and the energy sound as good or better than the studio versions. \\"Stranger\\" was a great performance by a very underrated band.

006092988X|5.0|I am writing a review on the book, Maggie-Now, by Betty Smith.   I have yet to read A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, but I am excited to do so. I could not stop thinking of the Moore family characters and how real they seemed. The values and the traditions of the day were so important then, I feel sad that there is a lack of tradition and heritage in America today.  It grieves me so that I really do not know much about my family history and wonder if others feel as I do.  This book made me laugh, cry and wonder.  It truly deserves the time and effort to read. I looked at my own children differently and dreamed their dreams through their eyes.  Wondering if that spunk of my middle child was the Irish in her, or thinking of my maiden name and wondering what my English ancestors were like and how they came to America, what did they do for work, were they poor like the Moores, having to take in laundry or sweep a street? So many questions I have now, because I picked this old book out of a closet, dusted off the cover and opened my mind to the past of all of us. The characters are believable, the vivid detail of the late 1800,s and early 1900,s was depicted effortlessly, and humor and pain will engulf you.  The flavor of heritage and tradition flows throughout the book and takes you back to a time you may have never lived in, but one in which you are strangely familiar.  The characters felt like family. Already I was lonely and missing them when I read the last page and had to close the book.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I agree when people say it's different. I agree when people say it's not as heavy. But what i disagree with is when people say it's not good. Even though this cd is not as heavy and probably cannot be compared to the older ones, it still shows how good Slipknot is in making music! This cd cannot be described because it is different but still shows what they are really made of!

B0001UL7RY|5.0|The first time I heard &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; on the radio, I knew that we would be seeing a more mature hardcore side of Avril. On tracks such as &quot;Take Me Away&quot; and &quot;Forgotten&quot;, you'll see that compared to Let Go, this album shows a deeper side of Avril that I know we will all come to love. She proves on this album that she has definately grown as a writer and an artist. This album is definately more mature than Let Go, I'm not saying that I like this album better or anything, Let Go rocked! I'm just saying that you can see more signs of immproovement.
B00004UEE5|5.0|After a struggle with the gloomy preoccupation with mortality in the first two parts, the symphony bursts forth into a celebration of life.<br /><br />  Daniel Barenboim's conducting is graceful and elegant--he's there for every phrase of music, and is completely involved with it.<br /><br />  If you're a fan of audio versions of this symphony, you'll really appreciate SEEING what's going on.  Kudos to Video Director Bob Coles who has the cameras right there at the right time to catch specific players at their key moments.<br /><br />  This is definitely not a static view of a symphony performance.  It moves and flows as individuals work together in inspired unison.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril has change ALOT over the 2 years. And yeah, you've probably heard bad things about Avril like she dislikes her fans or she doesnt want them to copy her but that doesnt make her MUSIC bad. It's actually pretty good. I absolutely fell in love with her 1st album. (It's truly one of my favorites). I dont have the bonus track so I dont know what that sounds like but her single &quot;Dont tell me&quot; is good and I enjoy &quot;My happy ending&quot; On her 1st CD I loved every song, but on this I like everyone. So dont always judge her by personality with her music 'cause they're two different things (Like, I dont think Britney Spears is a good role model but some of her songs are good I must admit) So just give her a second chance. Wait til another single comes out and see if you like it or download one of her songs and see if that is good too.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I have no technical or artistic explanation for why I loved this film.  I just know that as a whole it completely mesmerized me and left me feeling somehow lucky to have seen it.  I saw it a month ago, bought the soundtrack because it seems perfect for the visuality of the movie; I feel kind of haunted in a way because I can't get over the fact that I have to see it again.  The list of movies that have affected me in that way is very short.  If you can't sit still and absorb things don't bother with this, it wasn't made for you.
B000000H64|5.0|Brutal, tight, furious. These are the proper words to describe this industrial-metal masterpiece. In my other reviews I've already stated that &quot;Demanufacture&quot; is one of the four albums that elevated industrial-metal genre from zero level to state-of-the-art perfection and spawned countless clones.<br />Fear Factory style is different from what other icons of the genre like Ministry or Nine Inch Nails have to offer. After all, in the beginning Fear Factory played Napalm Death-style death-metal, and it shows. The music is built with incredibly catchy and rhythmically effective guitar riffs backed by similar sounding bass-lines. Think of the riff in Ministry's &quot;Thieves&quot; and you get the idea. Drumming is absolutely superb. The speed and precision of those double-bass kicks is incredible, I even thought it was a drum-machine. But it was not. To add even more industrial feel to the sound, various factory noises are played in the background. Burton C. Bell varies his vocal tone from angry death-style rasps to clean anthemic singing. The latter, being sound-processed with a little reverb, makes the record sound kinda epic at times. The album is a relentless sonic attack, that, being played at considerable volume settings, has all the power to knock you off your feet and shatter glass windows.<br />Conceptual lyrics add more depth to the album. They tell a story of a man who grew tired of government lies and started up a rebellion. In the end he turns into a killing machine, then surrenders to regret, but when death comes, it refuses to take him away, so he has yet another day to live. Not the finest story, but it mixes with aggressive industrial music perfectly.<br />This album is one of the landmarks of rock, and surely Fear Factory's finest hour. If you are even mildly interested in metal or industrial music, you must give a listen to &quot;Demanufacture&quot;.<br />PS I found myself among those few people who actually liked the remix albums &quot;Remanufacture&quot; and &quot;Remanufacture v2.001&quot;. I think it shows the diversity of this band excellently, because I can't think of anybody else who feel themselves perfectly at home as with death-metal and grindcore, as with industrial, breakbeat or digital hardcore. While the lyrical integrity is lost in remixing, yet the music is good. Underground dancefloor DJs might also take notice.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I would like to say that i wasnt a big fan of their first 2 cds, but i love this album.  They needed to change because i was getting tired of old slipknot.  My favorite songs are Duality, Before I forget, Circle, Pulse of the Maggots.  Some people are upset that they changed their sound a little bit, but it would get old if this cd sounded like the other 2, and bands need to change.  So if you didnt like the other cds, check this one out, you might like it
B00005614M|5.0|Nine musicians. Twelve songs. One of the most influential records in jazz.<br />The year was 1948. Miles Davis had moved away from Charlie Parker's band and struck out on his own. Neither a virtuoso like Parker, nor a genius theoretician like Dizzy Gillespie, nor a showman like Louis Armstrong, Davis sought a way to define his own &quot;voice,&quot; to make it substantially different from those who had come before him. He became intrigued by the arranging work of Gil Evans, who had developed a laid-back, low-vibrato &quot;cool&quot; style, using unique instruments like the tuba and the French horn. To Davis, the Evans style seemed an interesting alternative to the standard modes of large- and small-band jazz, and a sensible step away from the manic, frenzied music of bebop, while at the same time incorporating the best elements of that sound. <br />Davis gathered a revolving collection of nine musicians around him to explore the possibilities of the Evans sound, including drummers Max Roach and Al Haig, pianist John Lewis, trombonist J.J. Johnson, and Evans protege Gerry Mulligan on baritone sax. The series of sides they produced between January of 1949 and March of 1950 touched off the West Coast &quot;cool jazz&quot; movement, inspired dozens if not hundreds of musicians, and are still acclaimed today, over fifty years after their release, as some of the greatest jazz recordings ever made, in a field that has no shortage of great moments. The singles were not collected and released as an album until the late `50's, by which time Davis had moved on to other things-several times, in fact-but the music sounded just as good, and Birth of the Cool is just as acclaimed today as it was then.<br />It's not hard to see why. The music swings gorgeously, effortlessly. The musicians are a true ensemble; they form a fluidly functioning unit, using elements of big band and bebop but fully embracing neither. Davis, Mulligan, and alto sax player Lee Konitz in particular found excellent ways to use this, especially on &quot;Move,&quot; &quot;Rouge,&quot; &quot;Jeru,&quot; &quot;Israel,&quot; &quot;Rocker&quot; and &quot;Boplicity.&quot; This new style was especially beneficial for Davis, who had to learn how to work within his technical limitations as a trumpeter. He starts to develop his style here, a slower mode of playing, exploiting the lower registers of the instrument, using just a few notes to suggest the flurry of bebop virtuosity without actually having to play it. This was an important step for Davis, and for jazz in general, for it reminded people that one did not necessarily have to play like Paganini (or, more to the point, Parker) to play well.<br />Birth of the Cool is a lot of things-a transition between what came before and what came after, a strong musical statement by a group of musicians that had a lot to say, a strong beginning to the solo career of one of the most influential jazz musicians-but above all it is a timeless collection of great tunes, played ably by a collection of great musicians. Davis would go on to explore jazz from a variety of angles-modal, hard bop, orchestral, and fusion (unfairly maligned by purists, who resisted it much as big band aficionados resisted bebop)-but it was this album that started his journey, and it's this album that shows the rough promise of all that is to come. If it was important for no other reason, it's important for that. The fact that it's important for so many other reasons makes it a must have for anyone who loves jazz music. Simply put: if you don't have it, you should. And if you don't like jazz, this may be the one recording to change your mind. How do I know? Because that's what it did for me. It turned me around and made me receptive to a music I didn't understand or even particularly care for, and not only made me like it, but made me want to hear more things like it. I think it's safe to say that if it wasn't for Miles Davis and his nonet, I wouldn't love jazz the way I do today.<br />Pretty impressive, for just nine musicians, for just twelve songs, for just one record.

B00008VGL6|4.0|I'd give it 3.5 stars if possible.  Why?  Martin's music is more like a religion than an interest, so everthing should be 5 stars, right?  Well, these aren't his songs, but they are really good.  The two best are on the UK import of Loverman (Loverman and the German ditty), alas, they're probably not the album versions.  Five stars would be all the songs being as good as these.  Four stars would be different production.  People seem to really like blips and squeaks atop sub-sonics, but I think this is just the Depeche Mode version of being on the bandwagon (instead of building the wagon like they did in the beginning).
B000005ALN|5.0|And suddenly the silly boy grows up.....George Michael has scored a fantastic adult contemporary CD. He brings together his upbeat club world with that of a 40's jazz singer and merges the two worlds in a classic setting with beautiful music attached.<br />&quot;Jesus To A Child&quot; is musically brilliant. &quot;Fast Love&quot; is upbeat without being obnoxious. &quot;Older&quot; is pure sentimental jazz. &quot;Spinning The Wheel&quot; merges two worlds without colliding. &quot;It Dosen't Really Matter&quot; soft and quiet. &quot;The Strangest Thing&quot; another musical gem. &quot;To Be Forgiven&quot; traces of a romantic movie seduction. &quot;Move On&quot; back to the jazz club. &quot;Star People&quot; classic George club beat. &quot;You Have Been Loved&quot; great slow cut both musically and vocally. &quot;Free&quot; a final trace of Film Noir, mysterious and calling. <br />Bravo!! George Michael has convinced me he isn't just another pretty boy but a true musician with an inventive mind who is willing to take a risk on something out of the ordinary. I hope we all age so well!
B00005B36H|1.0|Since I am not old enough to have any real perspective on what I'm saying I'll just start by saying that nu metal rulz and Tool sux. I mean I like metal just as much as the next guy. Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, Staind, those guys rock. They're innovators and originators. Tool is just a bunch of lame old posers. I mean they don't even play these guys on MTV. I tried to listen to this crap but my attention span is too short to appreciate something like this. Maybe if I took my ritalin I could get more into it. Hey I know what good music is and this is not it. These guys are actually playing their instruments and the singer is actually singing. Whatz up with that? There's no yelling or screaming and he doesn't even try to rap. This band is so lame that they don't even have a dj. How is this guy supposed to freestyle if there is nobody on the 1's and 2's? This stuff is slow and boring. When I'm banging my head against the wall I need something a little more upbeat. I know my music history. I know that good music didn't start getting made until like 1999. It's a good thing all the good bands of today like Linkin Park(u guys rul) influenced themselves or we'd all be in trouble. Oh well I gots to go. I gots to get the new Hoobastank cd before it sell out. Later losers.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|Listen, if you buy this album thinking it is going to be the Slipknot of five years ago...save your money.  If you appreciate musicianship, and trying new things, buy this album even if you arent a metal fan.  This album is not even close to the groundbreaking sound of the first album, nor is it as catchy as the &quot;pop&quot; album Iowa, it is a great cross breed of heavy crunching riffs, and heartfelt lyrics that will find a way to touch you.  People can act tough, but you have to appreciate the fact that a band that has been labeled after two records as a demonic, hate metal band, can take this album and shove it in their face and say f*ck you, you're wrong!  A perfect blend of melodies, percussion, guitar solos and amazing harmony.  Yes, it does sound like stone sour at times, duh, its going to at some points.  You can tell they are holding nothing back in their music and truly want to give the fans something fresh and new.

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a brilliant novel, portraying the intricacies of Southern life during the early 1900s.  The plotline, consisting of the experiences of a eight-year-old girl, Scout, and her family, seems so simple, yet Harper Lee creates a much deeper understanding of love and hate.  <BR>Describing the events from the viewpoint of a young girl made the story much more fascinating because adults and even teenagers forget how innocent and pure a child's mind is.  Although fictional, this story was so realistic and honest in Southern ways, and I realized that that's how life really was back then: harsh and unforgiving.  This book really made me laugh out loud, sense friendship and hatred, but most of all, stop and reflect.  Because of this novel, I feel a great deal of appreciation for our world today.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The hilariously perverse answer to the entire Disney fairy-tale franchise is the CGI-animated, solidly PG-rated SHREK (2001). Considering the fact that Jeffrey Katzenberg, the \\"K\\" in the still-new (and highly successful) Dreamworks SKG studio, worked for Disney in the early 1990's and suffered under an extremely acrimonious relationship with CEO Michael Eisner (who infamously referred to Katzenberg as \\"that little midget\\"), this flip-of-the-bird spoof was inevitable. But this movie is not a letter of anger directed at Disney; no, it's a satirical ode *to* Disney---albeit one that is full of adult humor with a definite \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sensibility to it. Starring Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy---both of them \\"SNL\\" alums---this is a movie that makes many grownups laugh even louder than kids! <br />Mike Myers, as the titular ogre, gives one of his greatest comedic performances ever, doing basically a variation on his Scottish \\"Fat Bastard\\" character from the AUSTIN POWERS films (which in itself was a variation on his \\"SNL\\" character, the All Things Scottish storeowner---you know, the one who used to greet his customers by barking at them, \\"If it ain't Scottish, it's crap!\\"). Anyone who wonders how an ogre with a Scottish brogue ended up with the name Shrek, here's your answer: Originally, Shrek was a German-accented ogre (sounding quite a bit like the Dieter character that Myers used to play on the \\"SNL\\" skit \\"Sprockets\\"); however, during production, it was decided that the character came off funnier with Myers' hilarious---and dead-on accurate---Scottish accent. Because the film already had SHREK as a working title, the German name was kept for the character and the film. (The name was derived from \\"schreck\\" which is a German and Yiddish exclamation, used in place of \\"Oh damn\\" and \\"Oh sh*t.\\") Just to be helpful. :)<br />Anyway, the tone for the film is set with the green ogre narrating the beginning of a typical fairy tale book, and then ripping out a page and usingit for toilet paper---with Smashmouth's hit song \\"All Star\\" playing in the background! It doesn't slow down from there: soon, the aggressively alone Shrek is being pursued for friendship by a motormouth donkey---known simply as \\"Donkey\\"--- whose life he saves, and who is voiced by an irrepressable Eddie Murphy (who also gives one of the most inspired comedic performances of his own career). Tasked with rescuing the feisty Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from an ivory castle tower by the tiny and full-of-himself Lord Farquaad (voiced by an equally-inspired John Lithgow), Shrek and Donkey set out on...well, as the tagline says, The Greatest Fairy Tale Never Told.<br />You know all this already. Chances are, you have probably seen this incredibly rude and hilarious film more times than I have. So have your kids, I'm sure. (Although I do not believe this film to be appropriate for any child under the age of 8, I suffer not from any illusion that aussmes most kids under this age have not seen it by now.) Considering the fact that I first saw SHREK in the theater during the last glorious summer of 2001 and have owned it on DVD for the past two years now (seeing it probably about five to six times during this time), I can't believe that I have waited this long to review it here on Amazon. This was not by design; rather, I think it has been out of sheer laziness. However, laziness had nothing to do with my running to my local multiplex today to see SHREK 2, which has set a brand-new five-day opening record for any film---that's right, beating even the revered recent film made by Mel Gibson! It's an amazing film in its own right, but I'll get to reviewing it in a minute...in the meantime, the original SHREK is <br />MOST RECCOMMENDED
B00003CXCT|4.0|I never saw the special editions that came out in the late 90's,  but I think it would have been better to have the originals available on dvd. Still, Star Wars, with or without the enhancments, is still an awsome trilogy. I look forward to getting this when it comes out.
B00006IU73|5.0|A breathtaking journey into progressive rock. Each song on this excellent body of work is superbly crafted and presented. My personal favorites from this masterpiece are Gravity Eyelids and Strip The Soul, but every song is a gem, to be sure.
B00005A46T|5.0|Iowa is a lot better than the self titled, because it has that death metal feel to it although Slipknot aren't exactly death metal. Jim Root and Mick Thompson's twin guitar attack is more better sounding on here. Joey Jordison's heart throbbing double bass gets me juiced up, and Corey Taylor is more pissed than he was on the other release. Listen to him on People=Sh**, and you'll know what I mean. A very recommendable album. Other good songs include Disasterpiece, My Plague, Left Behind, I Am Hated, and Heretic Anthem. Slipknot rules.
B00000JNO2|5.0|Gimme Back My Bullets is generally considered the least successful of the original Lynyrd Skynyrd albums, but it has always been my favorite.  I rate it just slightly ahead of the essential \\"Pronounced\\".  I remember staying up late as a teenager, to hear its midnight debut on the local radio station (WDVE, Pittsburgh), and buying it ASAP after that.<br />\\"Bullets\\" is a transitional album for Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Most obviously, it features a 2-guitar line-up, coming after the departure of Ed King, and a few months before Steve Gaines joined.  The 2-guitar sound is a bit leaner that previous albums, but Collins and Rossington are more than capable of carrying the load!  But it's also their first production with the legendary Tom Dowd replacing Al Kooper who had produced their first 3 albums.  And it has the debut of the Honkettes, the female backup vocal group consisting of JoJo Billingsley, Cassie Gaines and Leslie Hawkins.<br />Gimme Back My Bullets is very much Allen Collins' record.  Over the first 3 Skynyrd albums, the songwriting was spilt pretty evenly between the 3 guitarists (along with Singer Ronnie Van Zant, of course).  Allen Collins co-authors 8 of 24 songs, Gary Rossington and Ed King each co-author 7.  But Allen wrote many of Skynyrd's best songs, including \\"Freebird\\", \\"Gimme 3 Steps\\", \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" and \\"Needle &amp; The Spoon\\".  On \\"Bullets\\", Allen has songwriting credits (along with RVZ) on all 8 of the original songs (Rossington is also part of the team on 3 of the songs).<br />Musically, \\"Bullets\\" didn't have any big hits, but does include several Skynyrd standards.  All of the songs are great.  The title track, \\"Double Trouble\\" and \\"Searchin\\" are all Skynyrd standards, along with the acoustic-ish \\"All I can Do Is Write About It\\".  \\"Roll Gypsie Roll\\" is a reflective piece about life on the road, and one of my all time favorite songs.  \\"Every Mother's Son\\", \\"Trust\\" and \\"Cry For The Bad Man\\" are all solid songs.  There's also a cover of J.J.Cale's \\"Same Old Blues\\" that has a great, almost funky, feel.  Trivia note: Lynyrd Skynyrd only did 2 covers on their first 4 studio albums, both were of J.J. Cale songs.  The other was \\"Call Me The Breeze\\".<br />If you're a casual Skynyrd fan, start with \\"Pronounced\\", or the original band's live set \\"One More From The Road\\".  But if you want to get deeper into the spirit of the band, this album can't be beat.'s \\"Same Old Blues\\" that has a great, almost funky, feel.

B00007LTIG|4.0|I only left out one of the 5 stars in the rating because I think the Dead have gone through so many changes and created so much variety of music that they deserve an extra star for all the work they did to acheive this.  What a band of variety.  <BR>     None-the-less,  I think they really kicked butt on this album with songs like Beat it on Down the line.  That song alone, to me, established the guitar style of Jerry Garcia.  Of course he branched out a whole lot but you hear the basic style he has on a lot of later stuff.  The album seems pretty tight and pretty original to me.  I'me sure Warner Bros. or whoever did the album was probably pooping their pants, wondering if it would be a go, but ironically, the band went in so many different directions, no one would have guessed they'd turn in to the cult band of the century.  To me it was a great job for a first album- plenty of energy and lots of variety.
0783228457|5.0|It is impossible to watch this film and walk away the same.  One only has to transpose the mediums used circa 1983 (Television names, cathode ray) with their modern counterparts (usernames, plasma screen) to understand that this film is just as relevant to the electric playground in which we live now as it was then - if not moreso.<br />Cronenberg is bloody brilliant.  First time I sat at watched this film near the end of the 80s it took me a few weeks to stop thinking about it.  Watching it again from the mid 90s onward, it has lost none of it's impact. It has, in fact, gained momemntum in the twenty-first century.<br />     LONG LIVE THE NEW FLESH

B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's sophomore album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, may be an angsty album filled with pain but it is her best work yet! The first single, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is an anthem to all young females around the world who have felt pressured to have sex before they were ready. Lavigne sings &quot;Did you think I was going to give it up to you, this time?&quot;. Showing her angsty yet playful personality. On another track &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;, Lavigne criticizes a particular someone &quot;Nice to know we had it all thanks for watching as I fall, and letting me know we were done&quot;. Other angsty songs include, &quot;Take Me Away&quot; and Forgotten&quot;. Non-guitar heavy highlights are the ballad &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;, and &quot;Slipped Away&quot; (a song dedicated to Avril's Grandpa who passed away last year). This is a surprisingly more mature and more admirable record than her prior, &quot;Let Go&quot;. Lavigne coloborates with another female Canadian musician Chantel Kreviazuks who's influence is subtle yet distinct. However, Lavigne keeps her same old playful tounge-in-cheek sound with songs like &quot;He Wasn't&quot; (which could be a part two of &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot;) and &quot;Fall To Pieces&quot;. Avril has definitley proved herself to the world and has found her niche in the music world. The media proclaimed &quot;self-proclaimed Punker&quot; has grown up a little more and made a delightfully successful second album.

0399143904|2.0|In reading many of Clancy's other books, he makes several references to things being too &quot;movie-like&quot; and very naive. Well, that is exactly what this story is. All the events that occur meaning the takedowns by the operative groups are all flawless, where none of the major characters get injured. Very boring.<br />Also, Clancy seems to lack a sense of imagination when it comes to naming his characters. There are four people in this story alone that have the first name of John. Also, his other famous character, Jack Ryan, is named John, Jack being a nickname. In his other book, Patriot Games, John Clark (Kelly) is not present, but a man with the last name Clark is there also. Also in Patriot Games and Rainbow Six, both of the leading Irish terrorists are named Sean. A little repetitive, isn't it? One other is the name Ryan. In Without Remorse, there is a policeman with the last name Ryan (maybe Clancy missed his Jack Ryan and had to put in another one to remind himself of it, i don't know). Though it may not be that important, it still shows Clancy's lack of creativity.

Kiyosaki spends the first third of the book explaining the difference between an asset and a debit.  At 40+ years old, I don't need that explained to me.  Then the author went on and on about how he worked for his \\"rich dad\\" for free and the valuable lessons he learned about commitment and hard work.  Finally we get to read Kiyosaki's real financial advice.  At one point he relates how he helped his friend finance his childrens' college education.  Kiyosaki advised him to sell his business and then he could further the kids' education.<BR>I'm sorry - I got absolutely nothing out of this book.  I was very disappointed and truthfully feel a little ripped-off.  I'd give it zero stars, if I could.

B00005QCVY|5.0|How do you describe Frank Capra's style? I once called it like Orson Welles, only happy. Visually, these two film-makers were both fond of high-contrast photography and capturing emotions in the characters of their movies. But whereas Welles seemed to focus on all the terrible things that human beings can become, Capra focused on life lessons and the good that lies inside of all people.<br />While Capra created many masterpieces, this is probably his greatest. It's easy to see why. Rather than focusing on just one aspect of life, this film (like Citizen Kane) captures a person's whole life, with all it's ups and downs. Basically the story is a simple tale of David and Goliath relationship between the small businessman and the evil monopoly, and the internal struggle in a man between what he wants to do, and what he feels that he has to do.<br />Perhaps there is a bit of George Bailey in all of us. He's a perfectly normal person with perfectly normal dreams. He wants to see the world, build things, become important. But over and over again, in order to help (and in some cases save) others he is forced repeatedly to give up his dreams in order to do what he knows is right. Along the way he builds relationships with all sorts of people in the town where he is forced to spend his entire life. But was what he gave up really an unfair trade? Or did he actually attain a treasure far greater than he could ever imagine?<br />The emotional climax of the film at it's end (where everything comes full circle and we finally understand how George Bailey got to the point he was at in the film's beginning) has got to be one of the greatest performances in any film ever, and Jimmy Stewart's moment of moments (perhaps only rivaled by his breakdown at the end of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). I recall the first time I saw this movie, and the huge emotional reaction I had at seeing a man who has done nothing but sacrifice all his life kicked when he's down (if you remember what happens immediately after he prays for help you'll know what I mean).<br />Ultimately, this movie changed my life. It taught me about the importance of friends, self-sacrifice, and living your life doing what you know it right. But even more than that, this movie is an absolute tour-de-force, and stands out in my mind as one of the greatest films ever made.immediately after he prays for help you'll know what I mean). <br />Ultimately, this movie changed my life.

B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I have been an animation fan all of my life. I've seen almost every Disney animated flick countless times. I've studied the work of Chuck Jones and marveled at the best of Don Bluth.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Japanese animation in particular for years. I have seen countless animated films and studied them in depth. I own almost every Studio Ghibli film ever made (including Whisper of the Heart, the Cat Returns, Castle in the Sky, and Castle of Cagliostro). I am here to tell you that Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is without a doubt the greatest animated film I have ever seen in my life...<br /><br />First of all, this is the first film that the animation genius Miyazaki ever attempted through his own studio. It is also a greatly condensed story, being adapted from a manga that it's creator wrote which was quite lengthly. That being said, this movie is PERFECT.<br /><br />The animation may be old, but it rivals, and sometimes even demolishes, animation released in the theaters today. The action sequences (and particularly the flight sequences) are truly amazing to behold. The sound effects are marvelous. The music is mind-blowing. The pacing is perfect, the voice-acting beyond perfect. The quality of the artwork continues to astound. But that's not why this is the greatest animated film ever.<br /><br />At it's heart this is s complex story of man vs. nature and man vs. man. How many times have we been over the topic of how man's meddling is threatening to destroy the world, and how perhaps one day the world will fight back? In the world created in this film, the world has been destroyed by what can only be described as an apocalypse (of man's doing). In response, plants and giant bugs are taking over the whole world and inhabiting vast patches of wasteland. Various countries are fighting endless wars with each other in a quest to survive. A new danger arises though, as one of the ancient weapons which destroyed the world is found.

What really holds this movie together though, is Nausicaa herself. This young girl is the single greatest anime character ever to grace film. The key lies in something Miyazaki himself once said. A man who is the protagonist would destroy his enemies and defeat them. But the real world is not like that. In the real world, empathy and understanding is the only thing that can save us. And so rather than fight everyone to the death, Nausicaa takes on the far more dangerous goal of making everyone stop fighting before they annihilate everything worth saving.

0452282152|3.0|This book got lots of good reviews, but I didn't think that it was all that great.  Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, was a fun read, but i didnt like that lack of emotional involvement.  I read it, and i was just begging for more depth and intensity, but it was just too shallow.  <br />Griet is a girl hired to work for The Famous Painter Vermeer under the instruction of his wife.  She starts cleaning his studio, then eventually she helps him mix colors. Soon she is helping him more with out Catharina's, his jealous wife's knowledge.  <br />Whenever the painter Vermeer and Griet were together, you could kind of feel there might be some feelings, but i guess it was too subtle, because i didnt know what was happening with them.  This book was a fun read, but nothing to lose yourself in.
B0001GL3KE|1.0|Look at the other reviews on this site; people either love it or hate it.  I generally enjoy romances, comedies and romantic comedies.  For the reasons below,  I loathe this film and feel that I must speak out (&quot;I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore&quot;) against garbage.<br />1) there is not an original thought or premise in this whole film.  everything is cliche, trite, cloying sweetness, trying way too hard to be &quot;cute&quot;.  It is a disjointed barrage of pap.  as another reviewer pointed out, this is 10 bad episodes of the old TV series &quot;love american style&quot; torn apart and shuffled together randomly.<br />2) there is no romance in this film.  there is only lust, infatuation and obsession.  there is no &quot;feel good&quot; here.  for the only mature, genuine characters who might actually be experiencing love, their love is a source of emotional pain.  most of the other characters are shallow, creepy losers.  the characterization is so paper-thin that frankly I didn't care about any of them.<br />3) there is no humor in this film.  plenty of attempts at humor, but it's not funny,  It's not intelligent, it's not even clever.  Even making allowances for &quot;British humor&quot;.  this is at a 5-year-old level.  &quot;she said the F-word in front of the prime minister!!!  get it?! get it?!&quot; not funny, stupid.<br />4) this film completely lacks integrity.  the 10 sub-plots are woven together by the thinnest of pretenses, and I find this very annoying.  is that the best the writers could do?<br />5) the actors and actresses are top-notch, but completely wasted in meaningless shallow roles.<br />6) I have the feeling that whoever's responsible knew what they were doing: recycle some sappy, air-headed drivel, wrap it in Christmas and &quot;romance&quot; and people will buy it.<br />I could go on and on. Don't waste your time on this.  see When Harry met Sally, Room with a View, Shop around the Corner, anything by Jane Austen.see and support something real, funny, heartwarming, not this cultural Twinkie.
0061015725|4.0|Prey is the first Michael Crichton book that I have ever read and it certainly brought my attention to his work. I can be absolutely sure that this won't be the last of his books that I will read. <BR> <BR> In this book, Michael Crichton masterfully blended science with futuristic technology to create a suspenseful thriller full of twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. I simply could not put the book down. Prey showed the potential of humans to advance very quickly in technology, but it also showed the dangers of it. Even with today's advanced technology, some inventions can still have faults. With this in mind, the story Prey shows that these faults can be deadly when applied to \\"intelligent\\" machines.  <BR> <BR> Prey is about a swarm of nanoparticles that were originally built to be used for medical research and military reconnaissance. They were very easy to control, except for the fact that high winds could disrupt the structure of the networking nanoparticles. Because of this fault, funding for the project ceased. The leftover particles rampaged out of control as they continued to evolve. They could reproduce, learn from experiences, and kill. It had been programmed as a predator and it was fulfilling its goals as a predator. The story follows the main character, Jack Forman, on his mission to find the origins of the renegade swarms and destroy them.   <br /> This book was very entertaining, but I was disappointed by the ending. Although it had a terrific climax, the conclusion left me sitting with a dull feeling. Nevertheless, this book is a great work and I highly recommend it to everyone that likes sci-fi/ thriller books. However, I must say that it should be geared toward adults, due to the vulgar language.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne has managed to pull off what few artists have done before her-she has delivered a second album which is better than her first highly acclaimed album. Avril Lavigne has maintained the quality of tracks in her first album;just as every single track of her first album was enjoyable and had a catchy melody, so does every track in this album-some songs are particularly powerful and addictive and are undoubtably of hit quality such as &quot;Take me away&quot; &quot;Together&quot; &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; and the single &quot;Don't tell me&quot;. The musical direction of this album, which is harder and edgier, suits Avril's voice and allows her style to truly flourish and reach impressive heights. I loved the first album, but I was entirely unprepared for how much I would love the second album. Avril is one of those rare artists in the current popular music scene who is indeed an artist. She  is a rarity as a public figure in her impressive strength and personal conviction, and her character shines through her music <BR>and conveys something that many of her colleagues in the popular music scene do not-soul.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I see that everyone here has established the &quot;shame on FOX&quot; idea (an important one).  I was shown this series by a friend who lent me the DVDs.  After watching all the eps, I thought that maybe I could get away without buying the series for myself.  Then a few days passed and reason returned.  The characters are too lovable and interesting, and the writing is way too sharp to not be part of the increasing number of people who are discovering this show and helping to preserve its life through the DVDs and the upcoming movie.  Buy it, watch it, love it (and scowl at FOX).
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Where is the world going these days ? I mean, can't people recognize real talent from complete crap ? I really hope most of the people who bought this album are teenage &quot;skate girls&quot;. If you are an adult (18-...), and you bought this, you should be ashamed for your ignorance, and total lack of knowledge in music.<BR>Hey, I got an idead for Avril, go make a duet with Blink 182, I bet you'll make tons of money !!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie was filled with gore and lots of violence. This movie is by far the goriest or violent movie ive ever seen. We get chopped off limbs, decapitations, There is one part in this movie, which was quite a funny part. IN the begining, a young women fights with a knife with another yound women. Thus making a rucus, than, when a young girl walks in the door, being one ot their daughters, they hide the knifes behind their backs and claim that they were cleaning up a mess from their &quot;dumb A*&amp; dog&quot;. Than, the young girl goes upstairs to her room and we see Uma Thurman violently throw a knife into the young womens chest. Than, in another scene, we see a young women, Lucy Liu, run across the table to an older man and with her sword, remove his head in a violent fashion. Than, a fountain of red blood spurts up from the stump of the head. Lucy Liu than holds up the head, revealing some of the mans veins and talks to the rest of the people about talking back to her.Uma Thurman than goes on a killing spree, decapitating many people and leaving many people limbless. Overall this movie was a gore fest, but a wonderful movie. Uma Thurman is wonderful.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Prelude 3.0: 6/10<BR>The Blister Exists: 5/10<BR>Three Nil: 6/10<BR>Duality: 7/10<BR>Opium of the People: 6/10<BR>Circle: 0/10 (COMPLETE garbage, no matter how you look at it, and I like Death Cab For Cutie)<BR>Welcome: 7/10<BR>Vermilion: 8/10<BR>Pulse of the Maggots: 7/10<BR>Before I Forget: 7/10<BR>Vermilion Part 2: 0/10 (absolute trash, and just like Circle, ridiculous lyrics that couldn't possibly have been written by Slipknot and disgustingly unoriginal acoustic guitar work. shameful.)<BR>The Nameless: 4/10<BR>The Virus of Life: 8/10(weird intro, huh? I hate that buzzing mosquito sound, but not bad really, worth a few listens)<BR>Danger - Keep Away: 6/10 (The only half-decent light song on the album, the keyboard work is atmospheric, but could have been a lot more varied)<br />Overall, it's very average Slipknot with some wrenches in the mix that tend to do more harm than good. The light songs are completely unoriginal garbage that are the basis for the term sell-outs, and the average, almost forced-fed heavy metal pieces have crap lyrics and none are particularly outstanding. Leaves you feeling cheapened.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is the story of good and evil and the value of choice. The main character, is a 15 year old lad named Alex whose life consists of crime, cruelty, and recklessness. After being betrayed by an accomplice, he is sentenced to prison where he volunteers for a program that corrects the seemingly uncorrectable. Only then does he being to suffer the consequences of his crash and burn lifestyle. <br />A Clockwork Orange is what I believe to be a fabulous novel. It may confuse a reader at the start because of the language, but its not that hard to understand the slang dialect if you have a firm grasp on English and are a few pages into the book. Also, one must be patient when reading it because the main ideas aren't revealed until later in the novel. There is a lot of building up the characters before hand, which is valuable information but may bore those who are already have a distaste for the book's violent nature. I also highly recommend that you read the British version because the last or 21st chapter is quite important.  <br />Anyways, the book is more oriented those who can see past the gore and sex and can grasp the main ideas the author is trying to convey through a clockwork orange.
B00000JPH6|5.0|Maybe my review is a little biased as this was my favorite film as a kid (Yes, the Garthim gave me nightmares, but that didn't stop me from watching it), but I still love this movie. I recently got the DVD after it had fallen into the dust bin of my mind, and I found that this movie is every bit as good as I remembered it. Kids will enjoy it, but there's much more depth to the film that adults will appreciate as well.<br />This movie isn't without it's faults. The script suffers at a few points and the voice acting isn't as good as it could be, but the great puppetry effects and the story more than make up for it. It's incredible just how much work Henson put into this film. Watch the documentary on the Special Edition. It took them 5 years (and nine tons of foam latex) to make it, from conception to final cut. There were often several people operating one puppet, watching what they were doing on a monitor from inside. Try to imagine getting one take just right with all of the Skeksis in one shot. Henson even put $2 million of his own money into it.<br />The look and feel of this film is incredibly unique, thanks mostly to artist/conceptual designer Brian Froud. Some call the plot cliched, but I don't think so. Sure, there's no such thing as a completely original story. What makes a movie good is that it brings enough new material to the old formula to make it interesting, and The Dark Crystal delivers with a passion. It's hard to find a film that is as original as this one, especially with the deluge of garbage that Hollywood has been churning out lately.<br />The soundtrack of the movie also delivers. Trevor Jones (shame this guy isn't better known, perhaps The Dark Crystal was the peak of his career) created a magnificent score that complements the movie perfectly and accentuates the mood at all the right points.<br />A casual viewer might dismiss this film as nonsensical kiddie fare, but it becomes much more complex when one actually sits down and watches. The characters have a depth to them that you may not see right off the bat. Even though there's never a human in the film, you get a definite feel for the characters of the film and share the triumph at the end. There are several surprises throughout that often catch the view off guard but don't detract from the movie at all.<br />I was brought up with this movie, and I'm going to make certain that my own kids are brought up on this movie. It's a wonderful film that adults and children alike will enjoy, one that has yet to be matched. Jim Henson later did Labrynth, which was fun, but lacked the depth of The Dark Crystal. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a huge favor and rent it, then buy the DVD, which has plenty of extras on it (But where's the commentary??? Frank Oz, are you listening?).
B0000AQVCL|2.0|I heard &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;, and I love garage rock.  So I picked this one up expecting more of the same.  Unfortunately, that song was the high point.  I listened to this album several times through going to and from work for a few days.  Nothing else caught my ear.  The rest of the album is a lot slower and duller.  At this point I don't remember anything else about the album at all.  One song, a great song, gives this 2 stars.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|First off to the moron Ron The Almighty, do yourself a favor and listen to the damn cd before you start passing judgement. You are of the lowest form of musical fans. I really love the close minded fans that have flooded the metal genre. Anything that has a miniscule hint of melody is considered selling out for money. I listen to all types of music and as far as metal goes I go for Pantera, Slipknot, Superjoint Ritual, American Head Charge, etc. Furthermore I absolutely love Slipknot and think they are the most interesting band in metal today. The self titled debut was amazing and Iowa was brutal. With Vol.3 I think the band may have gotten a tad bored with only expressing one style, being brutally heavy, and have decided to branch out. People who think a bands only cool if they make your ear drums bleed can say that they've sold out and thats fine because they obviously don't know about music and furthermore it seems that most of them haven't heard the whole album. This album contains some real heavy Slipknot metal, thats really a blend of Iowa's brutality and Slipknot's style. However on top of that the band dips into metal songs with melodic choruses and interludes, and I believe there are 3 acoustic songs on the album. My favorite of the acoustics being Circle. Oh no did I say acoustic? SELL OUTS. The fact of the matter is that the acoustic songs may be radically different from what slipknot used to play but they are still very well made and involving songs. They are not merely pop singles that the band wants to make money off of. They don't need the money. And the songs that blend styles never seem cheapened either. Of course there are also tracks like Duality which have more of metal rock sound, but does this make them bad?? Hell no, it's still an awesome song. Once again just radically different. I think the problem that people will have with this album is that they're not willing to accept change. Slipknot has branched out and delved into different styles ofmusic. So what if the whole thing isn't death metal from beginning to end, it's still good. Anyone who claims they sold out is an idiot. This cd is new territory for Slipknot and it's somewhat exciting to see them becoming more artistic. Hell there's even some solos on here, and on a whole the guitar work is much better, and the drums are insane. Best drumming on the planet. Corey's scream sounds a tad different but nothing to complain about. And it's also interesting that there aren't any swears, I guess he figured they weren't necessary which for the most part they arent. If you're a real fan of Slipknot and furthermore a fan of music, then you will clearly realize that they have not sold and continue to make solid heavy music.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 is one of several up-and-coming bands along with The Darkness, Jet and N.E.R.D., that although are very different in style, all are creating great music in striking contrast to the endless slough of whiny alt-metal bands around now that all sound the same. When I first heard the lead track &quot;Harder To Breathe&quot;, I was knocked out immediately; finally at long last, a band with actual TALENT that writes positive songs as opposed to the angry, self-loathing tripe from bands like Staind, Puddle Of Mudd, Nickelback, etc.<br />&quot;Songs About Jane&quot; is a solid and consistent debut, filled with catchy hooks and surprisingly good musicianship; after listening to the entire CD, I felt that I had stepped back in time. Maroon 5's fusion of R &amp; B and rock is not new by any means, but is a VERY refreshing change to the load of crap that is clogging up the airwaves these days. This album and The Darkness' &quot;Permission To Land&quot; are my choices for the best albums that have been released in the past 5 years.  If these guys don't become immensely popular and successful, something is very wrong!
B0000844I8|4.0|Excellent concepts and terrific special effects.  James Spader is very cool, but Kurt Russell doesn't have much to work with and only has one expression throughout the movie.  The TV series takes all the best elements and does an amazing job.<BR>Stargate SG 1 is certainly the best sci fi today.
B00008EY9G|2.0|Director:  James Mangold<BR>Cast:  John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, John Hawkes, Alfred Molina, Clea Duvall.<BR>Running Time:  90 minutes.<BR>Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<br />One of the most bizarre thrillers to ever hit the screen, \\"Identity\\" attempts to pull off a \\"Sixth Sense\\" style finale, but fails miserably with a disjointed, confusing story that is well-made and well-acted, but ultimately fails to follow logic.  It is a film that jumps into action extremely quick, with a family fixing a flat tire in the middle of the pouring rain on a deserted highway.  Ex-cop turned limousine driver John Cusack accidentally hits the mother of the family while she was attempting to help her husband with the fix-up, but they cannot drive to the hospital for medical attention due to the horrific weather.  They find a place to stay and tend to the woman's wounds in a ratty, old Bates-like motel.<br />In all, ten strangers find themselves at the mysterious motel fighting for their lives against an unknown killer that is walking the premises.  They are many twists and turns, points fingered at numerous killers, and so many strange occurrences in the last ten or 15 minutes of the film that is it hard to distinguish exactly what is the truth and what is not real.  Cusack and Liotta give suitable performances in the lead roles, but certainly nothing spectacular-the rest of the cast is not given much of a personality, mainly used as cookie cutter characters that the audience does not give a flip about if they are slaughtered.  \\"Identity\\" is a nice attempt at trying to bring some psychosis/schizophrenia terror to the suspense genre, but director Mangold seems more focused on making scary scenes with lightning and down-pouring rain that creating a film that is halfway understandable.  Some of the DVD extras are slightly useful, although the extended version is basically the same motion picture.  A thriller that had promise, but it does not succeed in establishing exactly what kind of movie it wants to be, loosing its own identity in the process.
B00005N5S5|5.0|The Terminator is one of the greatest action sci-fi films ever made. It has one of the best performances of Arnold Schwarzenegger's historic carear. <br />In 1984 the world is safe. Safe that is until The Terminator(Schwarzenegger) appears and stars killing woman. He's looking for Sarah Connor(Hamilton). He's been sent from the year 2029 to kill Sarah Connor the mother of the son she hasn't had yet who will one day stop the machines. The Terminator is a cyborg. He has a skin outside with a metal exo-skeleton and he has one purpose....to kill.<br />Sarah knows she is in trouble and she's scared. She meets up with Kyle Reese(Biehn) who warns her of the danger. She is skeptic at first but goes with Kyle. The Terminator will not stop however and Kyle and Sarah must find a way to stop this killing machine before it kills them.<br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is the man in this film. He was originally cast to play Kyle, but after he read the script he said wanted the part of the bad guy. He plays it to perfection. He has very few lines in the film, but he is terrifying in the movie. The whole look with the glasses and leather jackets and with Arnolds body makes one of the best bad guys ever. Actions speak louder than words in this movie. Arnold really is good enough in the moive to earn an Oscar nomination. You don't think they will ever take him down in the film, and the ending is great.<br />Linda Hamilton is great as Sarah Connor. This is one of the best performances of her carear as well. If it weren't for Hamilton in this movie and Weaver in Aliens we wouldn't have the big woman action thriller that we have today. You like her in this a lot and she's even better in T2.<br />The special effects are great in this movie. James Cameron's movies have always had great special effects Terminator is no exception. The movie is made so well. James Cameron really is the man and this guy really does deserve more credit in Hollywood. Very few directors over the years have made moviesthat are consistently good and Cameron has never made a bad film. He also needs credit for writing this masterpiece of a film.<br />The Terminator is one of the greatest films ever made. It's a huge movie and especially with pop culture today. It's stood the test of time. The famous line &quot;I'll be Back&quot; is from this movie, but it's always been here. If you haven't seen this movie you must go pick it up and watch it. If you have and don't own it, go buy it now.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Crowe does a fantastic acting job here.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter has quickly established itself as one of the most valubable franchises in the world. This is one of the best family movies of this new century and it moderns classic fantasy movie tales like the Wizard of Oz. It's so good because it stays true to it's roots and it dosn't offend the original book.<br />Harry Potter(Radcliffe) has no idea that he's a wizard. He has no idead that as a baby he stoped the most evil dark lord wizard the world has ever known. Harry lives with his mean Aunt and Uncle along with their son Dudley who hate him because he ins't normal. After letters start appearing at the home inviting Harry to Hogwarts School of Wizardy and Witchcraft he starts to realize things might not be what they seem to be.<br />Harry is rescued by his mean family by Hadgrid(Coltran). He arrives at Hogwars almost an instant celebrity because of his defeat of Voldemort as a child. He quickly becomes friends with an outcast Ron Weasley(Grint) and miss know it all Hermoine(Watson). The three develop a quick friendship and are all the three really have. Trouble starts to arise at the school though and because I don't want to spoil the details for you, but it's up to the three to save the day.<br />One of the reasons this movie is so good is because of the awesome cast. All three of the big young kids are perfect. Radcliffe got hand selected from thousands of kids who wanted the part and he's a good child actor. A lot of kids stuggle with such big roles. Look how much Jake Elliot struggled in The Phantom Menace. So much is on there shoulders and Radcliffe picks the ball up and runs with it. He's perfect as Potter.<br />All the adults are casted perfectly also. Alan Rickman is great as Snape. This guy can flat out act and you have to love him in the film. He is so awesome. I like Richard Harris as Dumbeldore. This was one of the last performances of his legendary carear and it's great.<br />Chris Columbus did a great job with this film. This guy was perfect for the movie. He's done blockbuster family films like Home Alone and Mrs.Doubtfire and he can add this one to the list. He shot the movie well and made it an instant family classic.<br />A lot of respect has to be given to Steven Kloves. He wrote the script for the movie based of the writings form J.K. Rowling. He stayed true to her book and didn't offend her or the fans. To many writers do that way to often and it's glad to see it not be done.<br />If you want to sit down with your family and watch a great family movie than this is it. It's a modern day classic Wizard of Oz and is a great tale of friendship and love. Two qualities we need more of in this world.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|Pink Floyd's 1983 album &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is a sadly underrated gem in the band's vast music catalog. While the album lacks the strong musicality of &quot;The Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and the dramtic theatrics of &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; still qualifies as a strong effort and is an outstanding piece of work.<br />&quot;The Final Cut&quot; is largely a solo work by Floyd bassist Roger Waters with drummer Nick Mason and guitarist David Gilmour acting more as sidemen than bandmates. Floyd keyboardist Richard Wright was completely out of the picture when this album was made having left (or fired by Roger Waters depending on what you read) after the extravagant &quot;Wall&quot; tour. The rest of the album's sound is filled out by session musicians and a full orchestra.<br />The album's overall concept deals with war and politics and was written as a tribute to Roger Waters late father who died in WWII. Besides its strong musical contributions, &quot;The Final Cut's&quot; lyrics are gripping and seem almost autobiographical. Its content alternates back and forth between contemplative tenderness and ranting raging bitterness (a trademark of Waters).<br />The newly remastered version of &quot;The Final Cut&quot; displays the album in its best sound quality yet giving more punch to the drums and bass. The sound effect sequences heard throughout the album have an eerie realistic quality to them as if you're standing in the middle of a war zone. If this isn't enough, the reissue includes one bonus track &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot;. This song had been released as a single at the time of the &quot;Wall&quot; movie's release but was left off the &quot;Final Cut&quot; album for various reasons. Now, we can finally hear the song in its proper context slotted between &quot;One Of The Few&quot; and &quot;The Hero's Return&quot;. It's like reading a missing chapter in a book and having the rest of the story make sense because of its inclusion.<br />While &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is personally still not my favorite Pink Floyd album, it is still a great album to listen to. With its superb remastered sound quality and extra material, it makes it worth buying the album all over again.sense because of its inclusion.<BR>While &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is personally still not my favorite Pink Floyd album, it is still a great album to listen to.

B00003CXCT|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy is a movie set classic. All of the movies are classics and are spectacular films. It's about time the movies are be released on DVD and we only have to wait until September 21. The only flaw in the trilogy will be the simple fact that we are getting the special editions instead of the originals. If you love the movies though that really shouldn't matter to you.<br />When Lucas made these movies he was broke. He had a vision for the movie but wasn't able to do some of the things he wanted to do because  he simple couldn't afford to do so. The technology wasn't available for some of the things either so he had to wait until he could get the technology to do it. This was his vision for the film. Most of the special edition stuff isn't all tha bad. I though all the special editions were great except for the singing in Jabba's palace and the dumb song that was played at the end of Return of the Jedi.<br />The films are going to look briliant. They looked good when they were restored on the VHS over a decade ago. If you saw the Indiana Jones trilogy on DVD then you know that Lucas doesn't play around. The extras I hope are fantastic. Many specials have been done over the years talking about the making of the moives and these should be just as good. The specials on Episode 1 and 2 are both fantastic and there is no reason to worry that these won't be as well. <br />It's to bad we can't get the originals and I'm looking past that flaw. These DVDs are going to be spectacular and they will be here to test the tale of time. This is the greateset trilogy ever made and yes it's better than Lord of the Rings. This is an essential to any one that calls themselves movie fans or Star Wars fans. You have to get this when it comes out and it's only a couple of months more wait. So hold on just a little bit longer.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I would just like to say to all the whiners out there that claim that Slipknot has gone &quot;soft&quot;...experimentation CAN be a good thing for a band. Remember the Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat days? Slipknot did disco. DISCO. If you can handle that, surely you can handle the artistic expansion allowed by this amazing album...
0395925037|2.0|In order to give any clear review for Mein Kampf it is necessary to attempt to read it as just another book by just another theoretician. While this eventually became untrue, viewing it this way helps to see it as it was initially encountered, which in turn may help us to understand how it went from long political diatribe to near-eternal infamy.<br />If we do that, here is what we discover. Adolf Hitler's long tome is not unintelligent. One could, in fact, make a list of quotations from Mein Kampf that are easy to agree with. This is due to the fact that in exploring his ideas Hitler touches on many areas of human and even natural experience. In doing so he states many things which would be difficult to not call truisms.<br />Yet in investigating this philosophy Hitler makes errors that perhaps it is easier for us to see in our time, but might have been harder when this was published. In describing human structures, Hitler is quick to designate terms that he feels he can pigeon-hole people into. Given his racial views this might not be surprising, but without that assistance, it might not be as easy to note his logical flaw when, for example, he divides activists into idealists and politicans; though he acknowledges that occasionally one is both, what he fails to notice is that the line between the two is not nearly as easily definable as he thinks it is.<br />Besides his use of this belief system as it relates to race, his tendency to do this extends to the rest of his writing. Mein Kampf is packed with various lists that Hitler feels can describe different phenomena. The more he lists, however, the more that you see someone in love with his own self-created systems than with any desire to map them accurately to reality. This is in spite of the fact that Hitler spends a good portion of the first 1/5 of the book discussing the evolution in his views as his old opinions fell in the face of adult-acquired evidence.<br />There is also a problem for the non-German reader in that Hitler spends a good amount of time focusing on specific words that appear to drive the debates of his time, the same way that the fight over words such as \\"liberal\\" or \\"alternative\\" defines ours. So when Hitler describes the battle for proper use of the word \\"folkish\\" to describe his utopian state, most lack the social history necessary to even fully understand his points, let alone judge his accuracy in describing them.<br />So the question comes: do you need to read this? That's not easy to answer. At roughly 700 pages with highly complex sentences that often go to more than 10 lines, Mein Kampf is a very difficult read. On the other hand, because we now know of the nightmare Hitler unleashed on the world, it is natural to want to read this to find out where he went wrong so we can avoid these problems in the future.<br />For people who feel that way, I would answer this \\"yes\\", as the answer for this is more hidden than you might guess. If you get into this with the mindset that you will find a one-to-one correlation of his philosophy to those of some modern-day leader or party, you'll be in for a surprise. Elements of right and wrong are interspersed all over Hitler's rambling. That makes it even harder to work through, but it also provides a reward more fulfilling than any black-and-white rallying cry. And given that that was the kind of world that Hitler saw, and we now know the results of these ideals, that might be all the more reason to put the effort in and understand with more maturity and clarity exactly where Hitler missed the point.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|one of my friends has this cd and i think its awesome, i just want to know the name of the song that is playing when oren ishii is walking with her posse down the hallway
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Although his music has just begun to reach my town (it's not even on the radio yet), I first heard this album from my sister, who lives in Nashville. The next time I went to visit her, I picked up &quot;Chariot&quot; at Tower Records, and listened to it three times on the drive home. I have since played it for all of my friends, and they, too, have loved it.<br />For the record, I am a guy who likes girls. I like this music because it's good quality stuff, not because of any attraction to DeGraw. This, I think, speaks volumes about just how good the music is. However, if you are attracted to men (particularly if you are a girl), then you will only need to hear this album one time, and you will love Gavin.<br />Anyway, his most obvious musical influences are Marvin Gaye, Elton John and Van Morrison. His lyrics are genius, and show a passion with obvious Bob Dylan influences. My favorite songs are &quot;Chemical Party&quot; (with a great country-rock sound), &quot;(Nice To Meet You) Anyway&quot; (which shows a maturity that would shame anyone else currently making pop music), &quot;More Than Anyone&quot; (an awesome ballad with great range and  progressions), &quot;Meaning&quot; (just a fun song) and finally, &quot;Crush&quot; (which risks becoming the next in the line including The Goo Goo Doll's &quot;Iris&quot; and, more recently, Maroon 5's &quot;This Love&quot;).<br />All that to say that this is a great album by an artist who shows more promise than anyone I've seen in a long time.
B0000041XX|5.0|This CD is terrific on so many levels.  In celebration of one of the world's great sporting events - the World Cup of football (soccer to us stateside), three great tenors and one masterful conductor (Zubin Mehta) were brought together in one of the world's great cities - Rome -- for a special evening that we are blessed to have been able to listen to again and again.<br />The concert was held during the World Cup in 1990 at the Baths of Caracella, which are ruins of the once great Roman baths.  In this beautiful setting Luiciano Pavrotti, Jose Carreas and Placido Domingo came together for one of the best CD's ever made.<br />The singing is exquisite.  The passion of the crowd in this live performance should equal the reaction of the listener.  This is art at its highest level.  It is a celebration of great music, not just of opera, but in my opinion, the soaring human spirit. What power to move the soul! You don't need to be an opera fan to enjoy this music.  If you like any kind of music, you cannot help but be affected by the power of this special evening. And what an evening, those in attendance were lucky to have been there!!<br />The casual listener will already know some of these arias, as they are from some the great operas of all time.  However, I believe even the most hardenend opera fan, unless he or she is a real stiff, cannot be helped to be but moved by this music.<br />It is heavenly!  I recommend this CD to you, because in my humble opinion, it will bring sunshine to your heart!!! : )
0380778556|4.0|Rebecca is the riveting and romantic tale of a country girl, trying to fill the shoes of a deceased goddess.  The story takes place at Manderley, a beautiful mansion over looking an English bay. Rebecca, an elegant mistress, has recently died and her widow, Maxim, decides to remarry.  He marries the narrator of our story who is a shy, simple girl now placed in the spotlight by the well-loved deWinter reputation.  She must battle the previous standards set by Rebecca and her known way of life. At times she is frustrated to the point of tears, not thinking she fits in. She discovers shocking truths and an abrupt turn of events changes everything.  du Maurier does a wonderful job of leaving surprises at every corner, and keeping suspense until the last page.  Although the introduction and some of the descriptions tend to be tedious, don't let yourself put down the book.  The characters are charming and the events breathless.  Rebecca lives up to its reputation as an all-time classic, which should be savored until the very end.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Oh dear. What an album this could have been. Eric Clapton finally dedicating an entire album to the songwriter who inspired him, and who he popularized. But perhaps he waited too long - this album is not quite awful - it is too bland to be truly BAD - it simply reminds me of the kind of music you can hear live for free. That is, bands who play in bars, restaurants, casinos, airports... off to the side, where you can talk over them, ignore them, listen for a while if you wish but never feel the need to applaud. This album is that bland. Clapton has taken some of the world's bluesiest, most haunting, evocative music and turned it into elevator muzac.<br />First of all, his voice sounds... well, odd. Whether this is bad production or a deliberate attempt to sing differently than his usual style, I can't tell. But he sounds like a middle-aged balding bar singer. Occasionally, when he shuts up for long enough, the backing band really get going. But even they sound like an average bar band going through the same emotionless motions for much of this album. The arrangements have removed all of the passion of the originals and turned the songs into uplifting toe-tapalongs. Yuk. Perhaps most disappointingly for an Eric Clapton album, even the guitar solos are uninspired and lost in the happy-clappy album mixing.<br />If this album had been by any other artist, it would probably never have been released. As it is, perhaps &quot;Clapton sings Johnson&quot; could never have lived up to the weight of expectations. But it should have been a darn sight better than this.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I've been a fan of Slipknot since 09/99 when on a whim I picked up their self-titled opus...SLIPKNOT and was blown away by it's raw power and inventiveness(is that a word?  well it is now).  I could not stop listening to that album, finding something new every time I listened.  Then came IOWA.  There was much I loved about IOWA and some that I didn't.  It came out like this behemoth slab of metal with no apologies.  In that respect it was a great gateway to other metal bands I now cherish such as Suffocation, Decapitated, Immolation, Soilent Green...the list goes on.  At that point in my life it was what I needed, but I knew there was more to Slipknot than just brutality.  Now we have VOL 3.  I'll admit, the first time I listened I was thrown back a bit.  Acoustic songs?  (Pick your number)X radio friendly ditties?  Conventional songwriting?  The more I listened though the more I was drawn in.  All the little nuances, all the hooks, all the...things that make Slipknot the great band that they are.  Since downloading this 2 and a half weeks ago (I have since bought it) I have not been able to stop listening to it.  I haven't been this excited about an album in a very long time.  So for those who have listened and written it off...give it another chance.  And for those who've been listening and love it...keep listening.
0385336810|5.0|I know a lot of people who adored her Shopaholic series, but I was not one of them.  I read one, but couldn't get into it and it simply stressed me out.  I picked this one up because just the sound of the plot amused me - Emma spills her guts to a stranger on an airplane, who happens to be her boss and who manages to make all kinds of entertaining comments as they meet throughout the book - and it was completely worth buying the hardcover.  Emma was sweet and charming and vulnerable, and Jack was imperfect and clever and mysterious.  I am not a person who laughs out loud at books, but this one cracked me up.  No, this doesn't have a complex plot, nor does it require in-depth research or a great deal of thought, but if you're looking for something fun to read, this is it.  It is absolutely hilarious, and it is definitely the best girly book I have read all year.
0345406680|5.0|For me, what makes this story so special is that I bought it, not out of choice, but because I had to study it as part of an English course. Of all the other books I own, none have affected me in the way that Eric Lomax's has. None have been written with such painful honesty. None have made me so  simultaneously ashamed and proud to be a human being, and none have made me cry like I did during the final pages of 'The Railway Man'. It is a testament not only to human endurance, but also to the spirit of men, many of whom died in unspeakable conditions, and to Eric Lomax, who was 'lucky' enough to survive the torture on the Burma- Siam railway, and the torture of its memories years later. Read this book and you will have nothing to complain about for the rest of your life.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|The latest album from Avril Lavigne, an &quot;artist&quot; that was put on a pedestal by the media the second that she arrived on the scene.  Without her, we wouldn't have such &quot;profound&quot; lyrics as &quot;He's just a sk8er boi / She said see you later, boy&quot; and &quot;I'm not the milk and Cheerios in your spoon&quot;.  And you have to love her affected angst whenever she's on television, in her misguided attempts to prove to us how &quot;hardcore&quot; she is.  I can't wait to see her in concert with Simple Plan - I'm sure the mosh pit is going to be the most brutal one in the history of punk rock!<br />All kidding aside, Under My Skin is Lavigne's second album, and instead of collaborating with those corporate hacks of The Matrix, she opted to work alongside Raine Maida (frontman of Our Lady Peace) and Chantal Kreviazuk, among others.  However, upon listening to this album, one wonders about the nature of the contributions from these talented songwriters; all it takes is one listen to see how flawed the songwriting is, and Lavigne's flat voice doesn't help matters much at all.  And for some reason, she continues to pronounce all of her &quot;s&quot; sounds like &quot;sh&quot; - i.e. &quot;Guys are sure hard to trussht&quot;, &quot;I'll have to kick your ash&quot;.<br />Surprisingly, Lavigne seems to have the critics in her corner with this album, as many have commented on how she &quot;bares her soul&quot; with Under My Skin.  This much I'll give her credit for - there is nothing as embarrassingly juvenile as &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; on this album.  But there is also nothing that lends any validity to Lavigne's claims of being a &quot;hardcore punk&quot; on this album either - it's filled with the same tame, docile teen pop/rock found on her last album.  If anything, the sound of this album is even more controlled and safe than the last album, if that's possible.  The album sounds like the work of an innocent girl in her early teens, which is in contradiction with the image that Lavigne portrays.<br />The songwriting is where this album really falls apart.  Examples: &quot;It's there inside / All I do is hide / I wish that it would just go away&quot; (&quot;Take Me Away&quot;), &quot;You held my hand and walked me home / I know / While you gave me that kiss / It was something like this / It made me go ohh ohh ... Did you think that I was gonna give it up to you / This ti-e-i-e-ime&quot; (&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;), &quot;This is when I start to bite my nails / And clean my room when all else fails / I think it's time for me to bail&quot; (&quot;He Wasn't&quot;).  Keep in mind that I'm only scratching the surface here - this style of writing is the general rule rather than the exception.<br />In summary: Another lackluster effort from one of the most overrated acts in the music industry.  Lavigne fails to impress with Under My Skin, a very ordinary, unspectacular collection of pop/rock lacking any kind of depth or substance.  Don't fall for all of the publicity that Lavigne and this album have received - this album is not worth your time.
B0002234LS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie alot.  The ending was the best part of all. I was laughing the whole time.  Johnny's character is enjoyably funny and i recommend this movie to all you depp or even anti-depp fans.
B00009V7T2|5.0|the first time i heard this band was live.  the sound they made was mind blowig.  i can honestly say that they make the most beautiful sound i have ever heard in my life.  so i went out and bought this cd.  it was hard getting passed roulette dares since i couldnt stop putting it on repeat.  but anyways, the whole cd is great. it sounds like led zepplin and pink floyd had a shroom party and somehow ended up with offspring. i think the mars volta is like, the come back of good music.  after hearing them, all these new bands that all sound the same sound even worse.  buy de-loused in the comatorium.  its the best 10 bucks i've ever spent.
B0002234LS|5.0|Johnny Depp shows again just how talented he is by creating a realistic character that captures the audiences attention. He plays Mort Rainey, a writer experiencing writier's block after his recent divorce.  Things get intersting when a stranger, Shooter, arrives at his desolated cabin in the woods, and accuses him of plagerism. Mort fights for his life trying to prove this crazy stranger wrong, but can he do it in time? This movie is wonderful and is perfect for a night with friends!
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril's second CD is much better than her first.  i bought it and took it home listened to both and decided that the second is much better. the first is more pop, and while the second still has some of that with songs like &quot;he wasn't&quot; and &quot;my happy ending&quot; the rock songs like &quot;forgotton&quot; and &quot;together&quot; are really good.  its really good that she managed to write some of the songs herself and although they aren't taht good, they do express her feelings instead of some professional songwriter taking their songs to people like britney and asking if she likes them.  not all of the songs are good, but it definately beats the first.  shes not a poser and she doesnt try to be punk, she just wants to be herself.  and the fact that shes hot as hell just adds to it.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This is one of the few CDs that makes me want to jump up and play air guitar.  I saw their video for &quot;Take me out&quot; on MTV.  I was hooked.  If you're looking for some fresh dance music, take my word.  These guys will hit it big soon- be one of the first to sing along.
B00000099Y|5.0|i cannot understand how someone cannot like tool.  Ive been reading some of these bad reviews and these people are idiots.  One guy, Nick something, said that tool gets shoved down our throats on mtv.  Has anyone ever seen tool on mtv?  i heard parabola in the background during headbangers ball once and prison sex was on beavis and butthead, but other than that you wouldnt even know tool was a band if all you did was watch mtv.  And another guy thought maynards name was steve.  Im not gonna say anymore about that guy, he said enough. <BR>   Tool is the best, buy all their albums, if you dont like it then you are in denial and lying to yourselves.  If you haven't seen them in concert, then that just sucks for you cuz the shows are like 20 times better then the albums(...)
B00003CXXJ|3.0|Shrek (voice of Michael Myers) is a cool digitally-animated film, but I do not like the Eddie Murphy donkey.  Too annoying.  It ruins the love story.  A talking Irish horse would have been better.  I like the \\"Hidden Mickey\\" with the fried eggs.  This is not a Disney film.  It is a Dreamworks film.    Kathleen Freeman (Jerry Lewis movies) did the voice of the \\"Old Woman\\" before she passed away in 2001.

B0001UL7RY|4.0|I bought Avril's first c.d. and I thought it was great. I bought her second c.d. and thought it was pretty good. Everyone was waiting for another pop album from Avril but, she said that this album was going to be more rock. I like the first album &quot;Let Go&quot; better but I still think this is a good c.d. It's hard to compare &quot;Let Go&quot; and &quot;Under My Skin&quot; because they are two different genres of music. I think Avril performs well in both genres of music. I wish she could have created a c.d. with both pop and rock because it would have eased her audience into the rock genre. I also think that her lyrics deal with what many people go through but, there are some lyrical &quot;difficulties&quot;. Unfortunately, the difficulties usually happen during the chorus. It is an improvement from many singers who have other people write their songs. I wish Avril didn't have to rely on a computer to make her voice sound good because it would be so much more meaningful if it was just her singing. Overall the c.d. surprised me. I enjoyed it but I thought that when Avril said that her album was going to be more &quot;rock&quot; it would simply be a little bit rougher pop.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I couldn't have said it better than dan norbut below me did. I like diverse music and if some people would actually listen to an album long enough to get to know it, they might understand. Oh well, those of us who can appreciate new and evolved sound get it. Songwriting is what its all about...that's what rocks. I've heard the album about 4 times now and I like it, period.
0684833395|5.0|This was the most humorous book I've read recently! Very entertaining from beginning to end! It is about a World War II bombardier, Captain Yossarian, who desparately wants to be sent home but he is caught in the military's Catch-22. Catch-22 states that one can only be excused from flying missions on the grounds of insanity; one must request to be excused; one who requests to be excused is presumably in fear of his life, thus proof of his sanity so therefore he must continue to fly; one who is insane would not make the request and would continue to fly the missions despite the fact that he would be excused from them if he were to ask. The typical no-win situation. There are many characters presented in this book, adding to the confusion and enhancing the hilarity. The plot...well, there doesn't seem to be much of a plot but once the reader becomes caught up in the circular logic of the military, the plot doesn't seem important anyway. There are grisly moments of realism interspersed with the absurb humor. The time-line of the story is not chronological, but somehow it all makes sense. Throughout the book, I found myself cheering for Yossarian and his efforts, hoping that in all the confusion he would come out a winner in the end. If you enjoyed the T.V. series M*A*S*H, then you're sure to love this book as the writers of the sitcom were inspired by Joseph Heller's amazingly bizarre tale.
B00000099Y|5.0|WITH THEIR 1996 RELEASE AEnima, TOOL SUCCEEDED IN TAKING THE SOUND THAT MADE 1993's UNDERTOW SO SUCCESSFUL, AND REFINING IT TO SHEER PERFECTION. UNDERTOW IS A FANTASTIC ALBUM, BUT TO ME IT ALWAYS SEEMED A BIT RAW IN SOUND COMPARED TO AEnima. UNDERTOW WAS JUST STRAIT FORWARD METAL, WHEREAS ON AEnima, THEY CHOSE TO EMPLOY A MORE MELODIC APPROACH (SUCH AS \\"H.\\", \\"JIMMY\\", AND \\"EULOGY\\" FOR EXAMPLE). THIS ALBUM ALSO BOASTS CONSIDERABLY MORE MATURE, THOUGHT-PROVOKING LYRICS THAN THE LAST RECORD. THE ALBUM TOUCHES ON SUBJECTS SUCH AS FALSE MARTYRDOM (\\"EULOGY\\") DRUG DEPENDENCY (\\"H.\\") HUMAN EVOLUTION (\\"FORTY-SIX & 2\\")ARMAGEDDEN (\\"AEnema\\"). AND SELF-RECONCILIATION (\\"JIMMY\\"). AT FIRST THE MEANINGS OF THESE SONGS MAY FLY OVER YOUR HEAD, BUT BE PATIENT. THE MORE YOU LISTEN TO IT, THE MORE THE MEANINGS WILL START TO SINK IN. THIS IS NOT AN ORDINARY ALBUM. IT'LL CHALLENGE YOUR INTELLECT IN A WAY FEW OTHER ALBUMS CAN. YOU ABSORB THIS ALBUM OVER TIME. LIKE MANY REVIEWS BEFORE ME HAVE SAID, THIS ALBUM IS TRULY AN EXPERIENCE IN AND OF ITSELF. THIS IS AN ALBUM THAT YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO TO BELIEVE. TOOL IS DEFINATELY THE BEST GOING IN MUSIC TODAY, AND DEFINATELY ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME!! HOWEVER, AS DEEP AS THIS ALBUM IS, THEIR FOLLOWUP, \\"LATERALUS\\", IS EVEN MORE SO. HAPPY LISTENING.
044022165X|5.0|Rudy Baylor couldn't buy a job when he graduated from law school.  He eventually gets a job but the guy who hired him tries to still his case that is worth millions.  The night he gets fired that office gets torched and he is the one blamed.  His friend then gives him a job with one of his friends.  But his boss is in trouble with the law to so he and a friend of his from the office get their own firm and work on that one case.<BR> Through the Rainmaker John Grisham keeps the story going so you can never put the book down.  One other thing I like is how Grisham kind of makes you feel bad for the kid in Rudy Baylor's main case.  He is diagnosed with cancer and you don't know what to think.  Grisham describes the details of his cancer very well.<BR>John Grisham makes the Rainmaker very witty, and is always gaining a new story to keep you along.<BR> In my opinion this is one of the greatest books that he has written.   I like how The Rainmaker is always gaining a new story so you want to finish that one small story to get to the biggest story.
B00005R2M3|4.0|This album is excelent. The songs are great. The best song in this album is &quot;The One&quot;.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's new cd \\"under my skin\\" is a great follow-up to a great artist. Avril's lyrics are unique because they tell a story of a bad realtionships but in a symbolism kind of way.* being the worst, ***** being the best!<br />\\"Take me away\\" is a great opening song ****1/2<br />\\"Together\\" has a very catchy chours that shows avril's vocal ability ****<br />\\"Don't Tell me\\" is the first single, and this song is very good ****1/2<br />\\"He Wasn't\\" is a song about a pervious relationship that Avril wasnt appericated as much as she wanted. ****<br />\\"How does it feel\\" is a great song but a little mellow for me. ***<br />\\"My happy ending\\" is avrils second single VERY GOOD song probably one of the best avril wrote and sung *****<br />\\"Nobodys Home\\" great song. catchy chours and great feeling to it. ****<BR> <BR>\\"forgotten\\" this song is really good. she sounds more angrier on this song\\" ****<br />\\"Who Knows\\" REALLY REALLY GREAT SONG, she is really happy in this song and its catchy and good AND i love the part where its just the drums and her singing sounds really good *************<br />\\"Fall to pieces\\" is a great song that deserves all the credit it can. really great ****<br />\\"Freak Out\\" is a great song that really sticks in your head ****<br />\\"Slipped away\\" is a song dedicated to her late grandfather who died while she was on tour. its a really great song and a song that everyone can relate too. *****<br />great cd, she has matured and so has her lyrics. she has lots of potential of being one of the greatest!
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I just wish someone could tell me what in the hell the brothers were thinking.Talk about watching paint dry. This movie was so bad I can't stand it. Even after months I still can't believe it. They had so much potental, they had it all. All they had to do was coast to the finish line. But instead they stopped a yard short ran backwards poured gasolene all over themselves and flicked a match...... Just horrible.
B00000I9MK|5.0|I adore Belle &amp; Sebastian, but I must say that half of my favorite B&amp;S songs are on this album and the other half are spread throughout the rest of their work. Not that I don't love every other album (with the possible exception of Storytelling), just that every single song on here is infectious, moving, funny, and stays with you a long time after you've stopped playing it. On all the other albums, I find songs that are a little too slight or meandering. But this one is 100%.<BR>'The State I Am In' is one of the few songs I've heard that makes me laugh out loud, and contains some of the wittiest biblical allusions I've ever heard. 'Expectations' should be required listening for every high or middle school kid who thinks no one understands them. &quot;Write a song, I'll sing along&quot; I wish I'd heard it back then: even though I'm a boy, I can relate to every incident in the song. I could really go on and on, but every song is fabulous.<BR>If you're just getting into B&amp;S I highly recommend this album as a starting point.
B000031XCR|5.0|This album is very well put together!  I went and got it when it came out!  Celine is one of the best female singers at her craft, and her hits are well documented here--&quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;, &quot; It's All Coming Back To Me Now&quot;, the funky &quot;Love Can Move Mountains&quot;, and others. The slick David Foster/Diane Warren pairings are well represented here, but she pulls it off every time.  I esepcially loved &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot;, as Celine gets off of the big ballad overkill and gets funky with this dance tune.  The newer songs are all solid, as she has a balance here with old and new songs within the 16 tracks.  Live, I Want You to Need Me and All The Way (with Frank Sinatra) are beautifully done. I would have liked &quot;Misled&quot; on here--those hip-hop beats sound so good under her and its fast pace is why it's one of my favorites. There no doubt most of her albums went multi-platinum in the '90s--Celine's such a superb pop singer and her vocal gifts are very well represented here!  Buy it!!!!!
0399226907|5.0|While on occasion I can persuade the youngster to read Michael Holt's \\"Rise & Fall of the American Whig Party\\" with me, she seems to prefer the caterpillar.  Who am I to argue?  I would have been disappointed if someone hadn't given us this book when she was born, and it remains one of my guilty pleasures, I suppose.  We got an extremely cute onesie to go along with the book as well.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Her last cd was my absolute favorite, and now it's kinda tied with her new one.  I love almost all the songs, especially Take Me Away, Happy Ending, and He Wasn't.  The songs are really upbeat and catchy, and i am so glad i got this cd!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|OK so they changed,big deal!wouldn't it be great if more people could start to appreciate the slipknot experience.I think the album is brilliant,Iowa was ok but the first two kinda sucked in my opinion. But then again most maggots are probably high school dropouts that sit around cooking meth.
0394818237|5.0|Like some other reviewers, I am disapointed the unabridged version is not available.  <br />But, even abridged, this is one of the funniest and most absorbing books in print.  This book is full of delightful cutaways showing the internals of houses, streets, and factories.  Like most Richard Scarry books, this one explores and explains a world which is fun, colorful, comprehensible, and full of well meaning people.  <br />Five stars is not enough.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|Nach langer kreativer Durststrecke lieferte Dylan nach der Trennung von seiner Frau Sara Lowndes sein meiner meinung nach bestes Album ab. &Uuml;ber den Opener &quot;Tangled up in blue&quot; sagte Dylan einmal &quot;that song took me two years to write and ten years to live&quot; und die Lyrik ist einzigartig in ihrer Verschmelzung verschiedener Zeitebenen. Das todtraurige &quot; You're a big girl now&quot; ist wohl das pers&ouml;nlichte St&uuml;ck, da&szlig; Dylan je verfasst hat.<br />Weitere Highlights sind &quot;Shelter from the storm&quot; und vor allem &quot;Idiot wind&quot; mit sarkastisch-b&ouml;sen Seitenhieben (it's a wonder that you still know how to breathe&quot;)auf einen verflossenen Lover(seine Frau?).Aber nicht nur die Texte sind herausragend, auch die Melodien sind die sch&ouml;nsten und besten in Dylans Werk, besonders &quot;If you see her , say hello&quot;.<br />Wie schrieb ein Kritiker im englischen Mojo-Magazin:&quot;Never sounded divorce so sweet&quot;. Dem ist nichts hinzuzuf&uuml;gen!

1582432678|4.0|After reading the first couple dozen pages, I thought this novel was going nowhere.  I was almost ready to toss it aside, but all the positive reviews here kept me reading, to which I am thankful for, as this is one of the most chilling examinations of the psychopathic mind that you are ever likely to come across in fiction.  Aside from this slow start, the only other fault I had with the novel was that the dad seemed totally clueless and constantly explained away his son's acts in one way or another, though I suppose this may be the wickedly humorous part that some reviews alluded to.  One may debate whether the etiology of Kevin's behavior as portrayed in the novel is accurate or not, but it certainly is miles ahead of Gus Van Zant's critically acclaimed (!!!) pseudo-documentary about the Columbine massacre, ELEPHANT.  This book makes a good companion piece to Putsata Reang's DEADLY SECRETS, a true crime book about two high school buddies who massacre an entire family.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation is a beautiful movie that will probably go over many peoples heads. No surprise in a society that is hooked on American Idol, anti-depressants, and viagra all at the same time. There are so many things in the film that appeal to me, I do not know where to start. Elements of realism stand out to me, in addition to a story line that has taste and class. Like most stories involving love, a man and woman are together for a short period of time and share a momentary connection that effects their lives forever. The exotic country of Japan plays so well into the film, and in my opinion is what really allows the movie to be so sucessful. Great acting, a unique plot, a soundtrack worth paying money for, and so much more. For the harsh critics of this film, I will recommend something on your own level, perhaps 'Independence Day', 'Deliverance', or even 'Schindlers Fist'.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Slipknot's days of pure aggression are clearly over.  While they seem to have evolved as musicians, it appears as though they've softened up a bit.  The guitar work is pretty impressive at times and the drumming is some of the best I've heard in a long time.  However, the thing that used to stick out about this band to me was the chaos caused by the 9 different members.  Most of this CD sounds like any other 4 or 5 piece band.<br />Basically, if you're a fan of Slipknot or any other &quot;heavy&quot; band that you may hear on the radio or MTV, chances are you'll probably enjoy this CD.  I'm sure all of the little snot nosed, pimpley faced high-school kids ran right out on May 25th to buy this one.  For those who have ventured out and actually listened to a variety of music, I'm sure you will realize that this a pretty generic effort.  If you're looking for good &quot;metal&quot; bands, I can think of about 50 bands off the top of my head that will blow the doors off of Slipknot.  I recommend the latest releases by The Haunted, God Forbid, Darkest Hour.....I could go on forever.
B000063DS1|5.0|\\"There's a flood out in California, and up North it's freezin' cold! And this a-livin' off the road is gettin' purty old!\\", drummer Levon Helm twangs as The Band gives a fiery performance of 'Up On Cripple Creek,' one of their many signature songs. And indeed, the actual meaning of \\"The Last Waltz\\" was that The Band (or more specifically, songwriter/guitarist Robbie Robertson) were saying goodbye to the touring life, and had the intent of being reborn as a studio unit (think Steely Dan). But that didn't exactly go as planned, and the odds-and-ends album \\"Islands\\" was the only product of this idea (but even that album was released mostly as a contract-filler for Capitol Records). And though Band members were still talking about a new album as late as 1979, Robbie Robertson was obviously now focused on his work in terms of films, and the legendary five-man version of The Band was no more. And though some critics are cynical as to why a group would give up touring when touring is what a rock group does for a living, Robertson obviously had good reason to say goodbye to the road; it was obviously taking its toll on the personal lives of the Band members, most notably pianist and one of three lead vocalists Richard Manuel. Robertson said in 1987 \\"To see people teetering on the brink constantly...Richard scared us to death. We scared ourselves to death.\\" (It's been argued that the touring hassles that the reunited Band went through in the 80s is what caused Manuel's suicide, but that's too personal to get into.)<br />It's ironic that Helm could deliver such a powerful vocal performance, belting out the lines that began this review, but the whole time, he was certainly not happy to be a part of this \\"celebration.\\" And indeed, the rest of The Band may not have been either, despite bassist/vocalist Rick Danko's energy on stage and the musical prowess of Manuel and genius Garth Hudson. They were not ready to end The Band's life as a touring unit, or else they wouldn't have reunited without Robertson. When \\"The Last Waltz\\" was released as an album of film it was a definite success, and the movie has been called the greatest rock film ever made. But Helm was the most disappointed. He wrote has gone on record as saying \\"the camera focused almost exclusively on Robbie Robertson, long and loving close-ups...the film was edited so it looked like Robbie was conducting the band with expansive waves of his guitar neck...for me it was a real scandal.\\" Helm also claims he was scammed financially, but it's easy to agree that the film does feature Robertson a bit prominently, which is why this beautifully packaged box set re-release is an essential item, showcasing each brilliant member, even if sometimes they're buried under the guest stars.<br />This 4-CD set features a heap of tracks that were left off of the original release making it the almost-complete concert. Band essentials like 'Rag Mama Rag,' 'The W.S. Walcott Medicine Show,' and 'This Wheel's On Fire' are fortunately included, as well as additional performances from the long line of guest stars that appeared at the concert (the songs from Eric Clapton, Neil Young and Bob Dylan are the best of the guest-stars). Concert rehearsals (including another essential 'King Harvest') and studio sketches are enjoyable listening as well. The album (and film) \\"The Last Waltz\\" is a timeless, definitive piece of rock history, and an important if not controversial piece of The Band's history.<br />In conclusion, it's important to note the song 'The Last Waltz Suite' (from the wonderful six-part \\"Last Waltz Suite\\"). Ironically co-sung by Robertson, this song is eerily but charmingly prophetic; as the song goes, \\"It's the last waltz, the last waltz with you, but that don't mean the dance is over...The last waltz was through, but that don't mean that the party is over.\\"<br />How true this was. It wasn't meant to be finished, the studio was meant to be The Band's new home. And though that notion never unfolded, the dance was certainly not over Helm, Danko, Hudson, and Manuel, as they would re-unite as The Band in 1983, touring until Manuel's death in 1986, and releasing three studio albums to surprisingly good reviews in the 90s, until Danko's passing in 1999., the dance was certainly not over Helm, Danko, Hudson, and Manuel, as they would re-unite as The Band in 1983, touring until Manuel's death in 1986, and releasing three studio albums to surprisingly good reviews in the 90s, until Danko's passing in 1999.
B00000ADG2|5.0|The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is most definitely one of my favorite albums ever. This is how true music should be: full of passion, soul, and emotion. Lauryn's voice is absolutely beautiful; it gives me the chills, especially on the song 'To Zion&quot;. After listening to the album, I was not at all suprised to find that it had one all those Grammys, including Album of the Year. I would recommend this album to anyone; it is simply superb.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|a band changes their sound...and all of a sudden they have &quot;sold out&quot;...and its &quot;no longer about the music, its about the money&quot;...astounding what some people are able to read into a change in a band's sound
B0000017CA|4.0|This is truly original, groundbreaking music.  And they just happen to be from the city I was born in- Metairie, La.  These guys definitely don't sound like anyone before them, or after them for that matter.  This CD is totally awesome.  It's hard to believe it is their 1st studio release given how melodic and polished it is.  Really all that I can say that hasn't been said in other reviews is simply BUY THIS CD!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|blah blah blah this sounds like stone sour blah blah blah im a dumbass blah blah blah they sold out blah blah blah its not heavy enough for me blah blah...fvcking give it a rest.  <BR>if it would make you feel better just loop three nil and pulse of the maggots over and over again, that way you won't have to piss and moan about how they put out an album that is somewhat musically diverse.
B0000648WZ|1.0|Definitely not for the squeamish and not too much in common with the book.  I don't really like Caspar Van Diem.  He looks too pretty to be playing a soldier and seems more suited for a Soap Opera. Denise Richard gets her start here, but she did not seem right for the role either.<br />It seemed like very poor casting all around, even if Doogie Howser is in the movie.  None of the characters had any on-screen chemistry.  And the whole look to the movie is a bad cross between Dune and Beverly Hills 90210.  Yuck. The only real character I liked was the female commander.  <br />Even worse than the bad sci-fi/high school crossover theme in the film was all the goriness. It was simply just gross.  I know the bugs are meant to be horrible man-killing beasts, but we could have done without the extra goop.  <br />Skip this movie.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Everyone else seems to think their &quot;enlightened&quot; opinion is better than all those &quot;13-15 year olds who think they know everything&quot;, so I figure'd I'd do the same and share mine =).<br />I can fortunately say I managed to download the whole album for free.....a definite plus after I listened to it.  Worth 2, maybe 3 dollars. Slipknot has totally destroyed the baseline that supported all of its previous music.  It is much weaker, and it does sound a bit like stone sour, although there are a few gems that do make this CD not a total loss.  The presence of an accoustic guitar on a slipknot album is a little disturbing.  It has been obvious for a LONG time that the &quot;ideals&quot; slipknot &quot;represents&quot; are all totally fake....if you honestly believe they as a band stand for something, you are an idiot.  They are entertainers, not philosophers.  All in all, not what I was expecting, and definitely not worth my cash.<br />P.S. - All the music you buy is made by &quot;sellouts&quot;.  If they weren't, you'd get the music for free ;)
0792164903|5.0|I once went to a school called Washington Irving, home of the Headless Horseman.  Naturally, I was intrigued to see this movie because I love Tim Burton, Christina Ricci, and of course, who could miss out on Johnny Depp?  He was perfectly cast as Ichabod Crane, giving him a comically quirky persona, but those are the type of roles Johnny Depp is known for and pulls it off well.  <br />Ichabod Crane is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the mysterious beheadings in the town.  Armed with his scientific know-how, he marches directly and tactlessly into the investigation, raising the eyebrows of the skeptical villagers.  At first he scoffs at the villager's superstitions of a headless horseman, but as more people turn up dead, he begins to doubt his rational explanations.  But Crane is detemined to get to the bottom of the mystery. The closer he gets to the truth, the more his life comes close to peril. <br />With Tim Burton's stunning yet haunting visuals and a wonderful screenplay, you'll be gripping your seat as this foreboding, more athletic version of the headless horseman comes to take the head of his next victim.  Who in the town is trustworthy?  Who will be next? You don't know until everything is unravelled in the end.  Burton and Depp, rejoined for the first time since Edward Scissorhands are both known for their artistic eccentricity. Together they made a smashingly good film.  This is the one to watch on Halloween if you want a scary good treat.
0553296981|5.0|Anne Frank's legacy has become an actual personification for the worst traumatic tragedy inflicted on God's chosen people, the Jews. And it's damn interesting in iot's right too!
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie has a great cast, great cosutmes, cutting edge action, original storyline and it's just plain cool.  The leather duds, flying kicks and black glasses have brought back the popularity of the trench coat, brought back appreciation for kung fu movies and sent the sunglass revolution on a spinning craze. <br />The script is quite clever that to this day I still find it mind-boggling.  It has definitely sparked after-movie discussions because I've had to ask my more intellectual friends to explain it to me.  I am glad that it decided to throw in action sequences which suited the less brainy audiences.  All around a novel concenpt and should have just stopped right here. <br />The following sequels seemed somewhat of a disappointment.  As you were expecting each sequel to become more novel and orginal, it had to come to deal with teh reality of the Matrix in the fight of humans aginst the machines.  It was better to have left you wondering and thinking &quot;what-if&quot;. <br />My favorite characters, by far, are the agents.  In their secret-service like manner to be anti-cool, they were very cool and just as lethal as the rebels.  &quot;Find them and Destroy Them&quot; is one of my favorite lines followe dby an agent slowly bringing his hand to his ear piece.  <br />A neat film.  Conceptually confusing at times, but the action more than makes up for it.

B00005OCMR|5.0|Tron is Disney's first computer-animated motion picture made in the early 1980s. A story about three friends who help each other to regain access to their programs.  One of them, Flynn, played by Jeff Bridges, is literally digitized and sent into the computer itself to be a part of the games.  He becomes acquainted with other freedom fighters and together they help free all the programs from the clutches of the Master Control.    This sounds like a very rudimentary precursor to the Matrix, but even in Tron's day, the idea of the computer taking over human-like qualities such as freedom was a very popular concept.  Disney added it's charming tradition of heroism, animation and hi-tech computer graphics to create this electronic world.    The DVD further enhances the back-lit animation effects of the environment and the characters.  And there's a Lucas THX sound option.  Disc 2 has several extras depicting the conceptual design that led to the development of Tron.  I was more interested in the Making of Tron feature, but even that's a bit long-winded.  You can fast forward to the cast interviews.      If you've never seen Tron, don't expect this movie to be a hardcore, gritty sci-fi drama.  This is Disney's more romantic version of an adventure within a computer. The special effects are outdated compared to CGI and the action sequences are much slower than the lightning quick maneuvers we're used to today.  But this still manages to be a very good story maintaining its great style.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I read a couple reviews this is crazy. Just like Songs in A minor! I loved both cd's. Every single song on the cd is GREAT! It had to grow on me, but I love it. This cd has sooo many different styles its crazy its like goin back to the good ol days when we could all listen to music and b happy. Maybe the 60's. <BR>No need to mark just a 10-10 for ALL songs<br />1-Harlems Nocturne-10 Just like the last showing us the great piano tricks.<BR>2-Karma- I love this song fits my ex perfectly!!

I would tell everyone to get it if I had a say so!!
B00005221M|2.0|Sure, the movie is fine for what it is. But what is it? An updated screen treatment of an inadequate 1936 screen treatment of a sterile and verbose early American novel. Cooper was not a great writer. But he was the first to voice a theme that Mark Twain finally successfully realized in Huck Finn. That American culture--flaws and virtues--springs from its contact with the frontier.    It's a shame that the writers didn't return to the original source material to find the urealized potentialities of Cooper's work. Maybe someone will succeed one day in doing what film adaptations of earlier unsuccessful films and books should do: remain respectful of the author's intentions, but find the core of meaning that the earlier artists missed. No one has succeeded so far.    I give this film two stars for the actors' performances, the film's technical merits, and the wonderful scenery of the Smoky Mountains.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|In short great direction with song lyrics. Not as noisy as iowa was. putting more emotion into their lyrics. And really good fusion of Stone Sour with Slipknot. Corey's vocals are still great and guitar is amazing. Top Rate Album by far.
B0000025WQ|5.0|I love Cyndi Lauper. I grew up on Cyndi's music. She is one of my favorite pop artists from the '80s that I still have a lot of respect for (sorry Madonna, you lost your edge and my respect with that kabbalah schtick, \\"American Life\\" and its unintentionally hilarious lyrics, and your awful movies which I am truly sorry for ever paid money to see (just \\"Evita\\")). Being a product of the '80s, I grew up on the music that came out of that era. Music for me then was fun, and listening to Cyndi's music was one of them. Unlike her then rival Madonna, Cyndi had and still has an incredible vocal range, just listen to \\"Time After Time\\" (as well as \\"True Colors\\" from the album of the same name). Twenty years later, I can still listen to \\"She's So Unusual\\" and still enjoy listening to it as much as I did back in the '80s. It is a given that I love the smash \\"Girls Just Want to Have Some Fun\\". It is bouncy, catchy and oh so fun to jump up and down like a spastic 12 year old on a caffeine binge. My favortie ballad as to be \\"All Through the Night\\". I like \\"Time After Time\\" but \\"All Through the Night\\" is my personal favorite. I love singing along to the song which is pretty scary to see and hear considering the fact that I am tone deaf. My other personal favorite track is \\"She Bop\\", an ode to the joys of, um, well...go use your imagination if you have one. I just love that deep synth line. It is incredibly infectious and addictive. The perfect pop song. All the more reasons why I love music from the '80s. It was all about fun. After twenty years, \\"She's So Unusual\\" still holds up well all these years. It brings back memories of when music was fun and interesting.
B00018TI5E|3.0|...uh...for the mind.  Or in this the the ears.  The textures are perfect, and John's voice more accessable that it has ever been.  Also worth noting about this album is that on Frusciante's website demos and acoustic takes of these tracks are available for download.  The beauty of these songs shine just as well, in their stripped down form.<br />Rock on John!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is definately one of the best slipknot albums depending on what kind of fan you are.  If you are a fan that can listen to a broad range of rock music, then this is most definately for you. If you are the kind of slipknot fan that ONLY enjoys a band that will scream in your face for an hour and no make any sense whatsover (in my opinion, the stupid kind of fan) then you will probably say they have \\"sold-out\\" because they have changed their style. I love their old hardcore, fast, and agressive style, don't get me wrong, but i think that this album is a change for the better.<br />First of all, I think that they have gotten much more mature on this CD.  The lyrics are much better than on some of the previous CDs (which is saying something cause they were pretty good on the other albums.) Guitar solos are also added to the mix on this bad boy.It is also a very dynamic CD, there are many differnt styles of music from the fast and hardcore style of slipknot, the the stripped down acoustic \\"stone sourish\\" slipknot, and I think they do an excellent job of pulling it off. Highlights of this CD are Three Nill, Vermillion, Duality, The Blister Exists, plus many others.<br />Don't listen to people who say they have \\"sold out\\" simply because they changed their style. These are the morons at the concerts whos intention is to seriously hurt you in the pit instead of having fun.  They are jerks filled with nothing but angst. Sure, it is softer than you are used to hearing from slipknot, but i mean with 9 guys in the band, im sure it mustve been a mutual decision because everyone has some sort of say.  Some of the reviews below me are totally stupid.  One kid said \\"i wouldnt even download, let alone the buy this\\" which means that they didnt hear it or didnt really give it the time it deserves, they are just an angst filled person that cant enjoy very well written and sounding music. Another said if you like KoRn, stay away from this. Come on, I mean look at the change from KoRnto Untouchables, and you still like both styles dont you? Anyway, pick up this CD if you like slipknot and even if you dont.  This is a totally unbias review because theres had been times when i loved slipknot and times where i doubted them a lot, but this is very very good for them. After a few listens, you'll agree with me.
B00005JMEW|3.0|Okay, so it's probably a little unfair to evaluate a movie when you've only seen the first half of it, but I can assure you that it's no less fair than having to pay full ticket price (about $10 here in Toledo) to see the same half of a movie.  Of course, there are those rare exceptions, movies so good that theater owners could practically send ushers up the aisles every half hour to make collections, and I'd happily pay (think &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot;).  Unfortunately, &quot;Kill Bill Volume 1&quot; is not one of them.  So, fair or not, here it goes...<br /> As I look at the cover of this DVD, I'm reminded of a famous pitch Robert Evans gave at the Cannes Film Festival about twenty years back.  While trying to sell investors on &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; he said, &quot;If you don't like the poster, then don't buy the movie.&quot;  Well, you could say the same for &quot;Kill Bill,&quot; if you don't like the cover, featuring Uma Thurman in Bruce Lee's yellow track suit and sporting a confused look on her face, then this probably isn't for you.  The reason is simple, that &quot;is&quot; the movie.<br /> Okay, so maybe there's a little bit more to it than that, but not much.  The simple fact of the matter is this, &quot;Vol. 1&quot; is as much a study in excess as it is a homage to the grind house films that inspired it.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  After all, there's no other director working today any better at it than Quentin Tarantino.  The problem is, the strengths he exhibited in &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; &quot;Jackie Brown,&quot; and &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; are notably absent here.<br /> When I think Q.T., I think smart, fast-paced dialogue and great casting.  He's done it time and again, but here, his biggest assets have become the film's greatest flaws.  The most notable of which is the character's interaction, limited to predictable one-liners and delivered with tongue planted firmly in cheek, which in turn has a trickle down effect onthe actors.  Some, such as David Carradine, are perfectly suited for this, but others are not.<br /> Which lead to the movie's greatest fault, the casting of Uma Thurman.  Don't get me wrong, I think she's one of the best actors working in Hollywood today, but she simply has a grace, a presence, a regalness, which doesn't fit this kind of genre filmmaking.  Another thing she has going against her is, well...  I don't know of a politically correct way of saying this, but she's white.  And I, personally, think that white people look totally ridiculous doing the kind of acrobatics she's called upon to do here.  I mean, seriously, can anyone sit though one of those &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; movies without falling out their seats in absolute hysterics at every fight sequence?<br /> You kind of get the sense that this is a point not lost on it's star either, as much of the film she looks extremely self-conscious.  Now, as a wannabe filmmaker, one of the greatest lessons I've learned shooting various short films (none of them very good) is that you can never allow your actors to feel uncomfortable or awkward at any time, but this is something that Tarantino's never had to confront.  See, prior to this he's always been working with the very best of scripts, but here is trying to make a movie that's essentially a homage to films that are predominantly not very good.<br /> Others, such as Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, have navigated this obstacle much better.  When they set out to make the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series, for example, they took all the best parts of the classic serials of their youths and junked the rest.  Tarantino, though, isn't as discriminating and, as a result, is far too conservative when it comes to making cuts.  That being said, though, still I have to admit that as soon as this movie ended, I couldn't wait to go back and watch it again.  Go figure.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I have read many of the reviews on this album and as much as I'd like to say &quot;You all make me sick&quot;, I really can't.  After all, everybody has their own preference on music styles.  So, I'll refrain from bashing anyone who thinks Slipknot has gone &quot;soft&quot;.<br />The first thing I noticed was the rhythm section has been quieted down a little bit.  Sure, there's still that prized &quot;double-bass&quot; sound that the proto-metal-fans dream about, but its a bit softer.<br />Frankly, when I bought this album, I was a bit worried.  I would not have bought the album if Rick Rubin was not on board since he has a pretty good reputation.  I thought, &quot;Man, maybe he was able to help Slipknot become one of the best.&quot;  I bought this album with the hopes I would be hearing a great Slipknot album as opposed to just good.<br />Well, Rick has produced an almost great album.<br />First of all, Slipknot can play.  They play with a good amount of precision and there are these awesome guitar wails that they've slid in amongst the chaotic chug.  THere isn't much showing off (a hallmark of &quot;nu-metal&quot; in my opinion) but you can tell their professionals.<br />Second of all, Corey can sing.  And because of the rareness of those &quot;clean&quot; moments, his singing is... dare I say... &quot;precious&quot;.<br />However, the writing does not match up.  A lot of it turns into extreme nonsensical hate rants.  This is not to say that it ruins the songs (see &quot;Pulse of the Maggots&quot;) and that all the lyrics are below par (&quot;Opium of the People&quot;), but a lot of its typical.  It's understandable in some wierd hate-drenched way, though, so I forgive them.<br />Overall, the CD is a very creative exploration.  I'll even go out on a limb and call them progressive grindcore.  Of course, they could use some help in the writing department and sometimes the music is a bit numbing.<br />Slipknot, good job.  And just because you use acoustic guitars does not mean you've gone soft.  Just different.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Slipknot proves their talentless efforts in their latest release. Face it-this band is just out there to make money and thats all they care about. How else could you explain this horrid cd: they try so hard to appeal to every genre of music. The outcome is one God-awful record. If you like it, go ahead and pick it up-its your money. It will bore you soon after a few listens. But by all means everyone needs to stop calling this crap metal. If the band calls themself a metal band, this is really a poor attempt at it.<br />In my opinion-this band has some serious problems. They arent psychopaths or serial killers or hate filled satan worshippers, but they do have some rare case of ADD-that in which if they dont get any attention they'll probably run off into a corner and cry. This project is all for show. The only thing worth taking a look at is the percussion. Everything else will just bore you within a few weeks
0446310786|5.0|When my mother first recommended Harper Lee?s To Kill a Mockingbird to me, I was quite reluctant to read it.  I had tried once before, but I was impatient with it, and the story seemed slow.  All the plot consists of is a girl and her brother in a slow-moving southern town.  Boring, I thought to myself.  <BR> Interestingly, now that I have actually focused on the book, it is one of the most thought-provoking books that I have read.  It is not about incredible quest and danger, sorcery and knights, or massive wars.  In fact, it is a story about young girl?s small ventures, which in perspective are great adventures and challenges.  Jean-Louise Finch, better known as Scout, narrates the story with interesting and colorful intricacy. she tells her many tales with a viewpoint that cannot be replicated by an adult.  Attempting to catch a glimpse of the infamous maniac, Boo Radely, with her brother Jem and summertime cohort Dill becomes a great mission with twisted plans.  Consulting her all-knowing father Atticus turns into conferring with a great wise man.  All this woven into her attempts to understand the stubbornness and prejudice of the adult world makes for a wonderfully deep story.       <BR>  All through the book, what at first seems like a slow plot evolves into a simple yet intriguing plot that will keep you reading.  Though probably not a book for those who don?t read a lot, specifically kids, it definitely will catch the eyes and trigger the mind of most avid readers.  A great book, strongly recommended.
B00004U45G|4.0|Don't undertstand this release. Why would Jimmy Page tour with the Black Crowes, not long after he tours with PLant? Sounds like a little animostity between Page and Plant. Page did that rap version of Kashmir and his solo album with David &quot;Coverplant&quot;, JImmy has made a second career out of some of the &quot;many&quot; Zeppitators. It's not a bad cd, but why would you want the immitation instead of the real thing. The canceling of this tour consequently was the end of the Black Crowes. Chris Robinson does a good job , but he certainly proves he is no Robert Plant. One of the highlights was a cover of Fleetmac's &quot;oh well&quot; (peter green era).I just understand why this was released, other than to upset Robert PLant.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This was the second album I bought straight from its release. For me, I was curious what Madonna would come up with following her last release, &quot;Music.&quot; Well, I learned a valuable lesson; put aside expectations. I'll be honest in saying that it took more than a few listens for this CD to really set in with me. This isn't &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and it isn't &quot;Erotica.&quot; This is an album that is done in the same fashion as &quot;Ray of Light.&quot; It's revealing, more like a diary of Madonna. It speaks of her life as of 2003. We see her pealing away her image and getting down to her core. Yeah, it may be dull to some but for me, this is musical genius.<br />Some reviewers have chosen not to speak about the music at all. Not every release from an artist is going to top the previous. This is worth more than a listen; it's worth some reflection. I thought it was interesting that Madonna used a blend of rock and techno to spin a very unique album. There are some great tracks on this CD and Madonna explores what it means (not for everyone but just for her personally) to be an American. &quot;American Life&quot; rivals her old image of being the &quot;Material Girl.&quot; She speaks a lot on this album of how having access to money and wealth isn't everything in life. This album, I believe just as much as &quot;Ray of Light&quot; deals a lot with her Kabbalah beliefs. &quot;Mother and Father&quot; speaks of her parents and has Madonna breaking down into a child-like state, complaining about her childhood and mocking her own foolishness in not understanding them earlier in her life. &quot;Nobody Knows Me&quot; is amusing because it goes with how she changes her image often, and how critics attack her (look at many of the reviews on this site) but how she's living her life as she wants. &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; seems to be a follow up to &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; in that it has the gospel choir, it deals with a loved on and has Madonna taking on her position as an individual. &quot;Love Profusion&quot; is a great song that unfortunately got too much play do to the commercial it was used in. I still love it because rarely do we get a love song from Madonna. It goes against &quot;Frozen&quot; in that its a brighter song that shows her in conflict while experiencing true love and satisfaction and still having limits.<br />  Dare I say this is one of those pieces of work that will never get the credit it deserves? She took three years to release this and it was worth the wait. It has a great deal of thought in it. The music and messages stick with me more so than those of &quot;Music.&quot; Madonna put out an album that explained who she was, who she is, and who she wants to be. It's a revealing album that may be rediscovered with her 2004 Re-Invention tour.

B00004C8TC|5.0|Radu Lupu, André Previn, and the London Symphony Orchestra give us two of the finest accounts of these great concertos.  Hands down, these are marvelous interpretations.<br />Radu Lupu's handling of these concertos is very intelligent and passionate.  Lupu is in full control of his fantastic technique, which allows him to bring a level of depth to his part that is very deep and thoughtful.  Never does he simply &quot;pound&quot; out passages - rather, even during the most dramatic of parts, Lupu is always in total control.  His power is wonderful, and he brings a full-bodied approach to the louder passages.  But it's his lyric beauty that is truly astounding.  Lupu's gentle touch in lighter passages is breathtaking.<br />Previn brings a level of understanding to his part as conductor.  As a pianist himself, Previn's sympathetic and insightful interpretation never drowns out the soloist, but accompanies the piano with a high level of sensitivity.  In essence, Previn knows what he is doing here, molding the LSO into the perfect companion for Lupu.<br />All together, these two performances are wonderful.  Highly recommended.
B000002N3J|4.0|This is one of those works by Madonna that gets over looked for some reason. Call it another \\"greatest hits\\" with a twist. Madonna puts forth an album with ballads that are not so much the love songs as we're used but are songs about love. Whether it's romantic love gone wrong as with \\"You'll See,\\" the love that exists between fathers and daughters in \\"Oh Father,\\" or diminishing love as featured in \\"This Used to be My Playground,\\" Madonna sets aside an album to reveal her more intimate side. While it may be somewhat of a shocker from a woman who put out albums entitled \\"Bedtime Stories\\" and \\"Erotica\\" and has been seen rolling around a stage singing 'Like a Virgin,' Madonna truly is amazing on this CD.<br />There were new tracks such as \\"You'll See,\\" \\"Take a Bow\\" and \\"I Want You,\\" they go well with tracks that have been popular in the past. This is one of the few CDs you'll be able to find her \\"This Used to be My Playground\\" from the movie 'A League of Their Own.' This CD also has a remixed version of \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" which is beyond excellent. It's moving, sweeping, the drums and sounds in the background give you a sense of longing as well as anger over a lost love. There is also a second version of \\"I Want You\\" done with an orchestra. This was one of the best tracks in my opinion. It has Madonna showing off her vocals. She gives a sense of haunting, hurt and a mix of emotions that leaves you with an odd feeling.<br /> While this could be counted as a \\"best of\\" collection, it stands out on its own as a collection of Madonna showing off her sensitive side. She re-invents herself here, stripping down the sexed-up pop singer we knew from the early 90s. Here she settles down which actually works for her. I'd say this and her later albums \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"American Life\\" are in their own league because they are albums where Madonna puts aside the desire to produce dance chart topping hits for more meaningful songs filled with substance. This is an impressive collection of some of Madonna's best work and its unfortunate that it isn't given a lot of attention and or recognition these days. If your a Madonna fan, this is a must for your collection. If not, I'd still suggest you give it a try; you may discover that your a fan of the less flashy Madonna.ive collection of some of Madonna's best work and its unfortunate that it isn't given a lot of attention and or recognition these days.

B0001AVZA8|5.0|I found it an enchanting movie, which (rather like the best of Mozart) took formulas and conventions, and created something more than the sum of it's semi-predicatable parts.  I underline the semi -- there are unexpected twists!  Diane Keaton is pitch perfect -- looking every one of her beautiful 57 years old.  An inspiration for those of us coming to terms with reaching \\"a certain age.\\"  <br />I may be in the minority, but I really wanted to see Keaton's character stay with Reeves.  Not only because he's better-looking (in this context, perhaps that is damning him with faint praise), but because of the interactions between his character and Keaton's, in which it evident how much he values the entire person that is \\"Erica Berry\\" -- unconditional love such as that is exceedingly rare.  It would also have been interesting for Harry to have to come to grips with how he's lived his life, a bit like Julia Roberts in \\"My Best Friend's Wedding.\\"  We can't always have what we want, and sometimes it is too late for \\"I'm sorry, I've changed\\" to make it all okay.  I perhaps should learn that lesson while submitting this review...after all, it is JUST A MOVIE!
B000002NJS|4.0|This is one of those CDs that is hands down good. Reviewing it, it's important to point out that it's good because its such a departure from the rest of her work. As other reviewers pointed out, it had been a long time sense the music world had an appearance by Madonna. She returns after \\"Bedtime Stories,\\" ending on the song 'Take a Bow.' During her new call to stage, she returns completely re-done and remixed. \\"Ray of Light\\" is not really pop. It experiments with trance which back then was rather new. She's of course continued to experiment with it since using it but it was here when it was all new for Madonna.<br /> This was a turning point in Madonna's personal life and her musical career. She made \\"Ray of Light\\" personal, mixing her new-found religious beliefs in with her gained insight on life she picked up during her departure. The striking difference is that she's mature and so is her music. \\"Ray of Light\\" doesn't have love songs that are about sex and lust as in \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Bedtime Stories.\\" It deals with growing up, growing into the person you're meant to be, letting go of old things. I call this album the \\"Gospel of Madonna\\" mainly because you can walk away from it touched in some way. It's a moving piece of work, appealing to everyone on some level.<br />  While the title track is fun and deserving of all the acclaim it recieved and still gets, I think another release on here by the name of 'Nothing Really Matters' seemed to set the tone for this massive music star. She begins, as I said, to remix her image by scolding those who may go after material wealth and goods and overlook other important lessons and matters of life. It's a song that pulls you in and gets you moving. It's touching and even sad in some manner while having a great deal of power and influence. \\"Little Star\\" is soft and like a lullaby; something new for Madonna. It's written to her newborn child and has Madonna stepping into her new role as a mother. \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" is another track that is fast moving and gives you the sense of urgency and progress as Madonna gives you some instuctions on how you should conduct your life. 'Shanti/Ashtangi' is another track that stands out. Though it'll take more research on your part to translate it all, it reveals that Madonna has newly acquired knowledge on life and spirituality.<br />  \\"Ray of Light\\" isn't my favorite Madonna CD but it stands as a moving piece of work that shows that Madonna is indeed a perfectionist. She put work into this and you can tell by the thoughtful songs and their moral lessons to be picked up. It's one of those CDs that you have to listen to closely to pick up on everything and once you do, it sticks with you. Inspiring in many ways and sets Madonna apart from most other artist. I can't think of many who have put out a CD as personal and moving as she has. It's a personal CD, very revealing and brutally honest which makes it great. It stands out among Madonna's works that take you into her life and mind in a very revealing manner, such as her earlier CD \\"Something to Remember\\" and her 2003 release, \\"American Life.\\"ack that is fast moving and gives you the sense of urgency and progress as Madonna gives you some instuctions on how you should conduct your life.

0812550706|5.0|I loved Ender's Game. I only read it though because my seventh grade brother did(I'm a fith grader,). It wasn't picture-book easy but I enjoyed and understand it so much I read it over and over!As soon as I started I became attached to Ender. The characters are so relalistic It seems like they're with you in the room. I also,in some ways, relate to Ender. I have been the small smart one in some things so I have to work to the top.I am very competivive although my competivnes can't compete with Enders. I bet your wondering Why won't she tell me about the book?!. Well I don't want to spoil the book!!!!!!
B000002MUW|4.0|This is one great piece of work. Madonna experimented with R&B and it sounded great. There were a few tracks that, to me, didn't seem to click. The title track \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is rather bizzare and out there. I'm not sure if I understand it completely and for me that was one of this release's flaws. The others are a great assortment of materials that seemed to go with the flow for Madonna. \\"Erotica\\" had Madonna flirting with the audience over sex and her views on it. After the flirtation, she takes you in, seduces you with these tracks, and closes out what seems to be her \\"Sex\\" days. It's rather smart musically.<br />  There were great tracks on here that have over the years come to be known as Madonna's staple hits. \\"Secret\\" has one of the most alluring beats and chorus' that I've heard. It's slow grooving with an nice story that you have to admire Madonna for taking on. \\"Human Nature\\" is right up there as being one of the best tracks from this CD. It's shocking when you first hear it; she curses and then tells you she's not sorry. Songs like this are worth a listen to. They're not just mindless releases but thoughtful and empowering. \\"Take a Bow\\" is a fittinc conclusion to the CD. It sounds different from her other things and the message seemed to allude to the fact that Madonna was moving on in her career, life, and progress. It was a great transition into her future releases.<br />  As for tracks that don't often get much mention, they were surprisingly good. I found them all to be different from her other material. They were less pop and, as she set out to do, sounded more R&B-like which was a genre she fit in well to. \\"Survival\\" is a great song- up-tempo, great vocals, a nice rhythm. I think this was single-release worthy and I'm not sure if it ever got that treatment. \\"Don't Stop\\" is a good song that's meant for dancing; the only flaw is that it has lines such as \\"say la-dee-da-dee\\" but other than that, a good take on a song. To round out the seduction Madonna lays out, \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\" is catchy and leads into the more intimate part of the CD. \\"Inside of Me\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\" are moodier, more sensual while not being overly vulgar.<br />  This CD could be summed up in many manners. Great, a masterpiece, interesting. Sure. It's all of those things. I also would like to say that it's fun. I look at it as a continuation of \\"Erotica\\" and I'm not sure why it doesn't get its deserved acclaim and attention. Regardless, this is a CD that belongs in your collection.onna lays out, \\"I'd Rather Be Your Lover\\" is catchy and leads into the more intimate part of the CD. \\"Inside of Me\\" and \\"Forbidden Love\\" are moodier, more sensual while not being overly vulgar.<br />  This CD could be summed up in many manners.

B0001NBMBC|4.0|Well, all i can say is if your only into heavy hardcore music and that you don't caare about melodics, it might not be your thing. I like almost all styles of music especially Death, Black and Thrash metal. <BR>It's a good CD but like that other dude said, It aint Slipknot. A stone sour fan would like this album. I bought this album and don't regret it, but i must admit i wouldve loved to have another (sic) Slipknot album like the Self-Titled... Even a similar one as Mate Feed Kill Repeat...<BR>If your only into thrashing and sic music, listen to some songs on the album first before buying it.
B00005Q66T|4.0|From the previous reviews, you get the idea that this CD is great. There are a few things that, in my opinion, keep it from being an ultimate collection. As other reviewers noted, there are some hits that are left out. I'd had liked to have &quot;This Used to be my Playground&quot; included as well as &quot;Nothing Really Matters&quot; which while it wasn't as large of a hit that many hoped, had spawned many great remixes. That's another point; some of the songs on here are in their edited/remixed version. I think the best example is &quot;Human Nature&quot; which is tidied up from the great original form as it was on Bedtime Stories.<br />If you haven't listened to any Madonna before, this is still a great place to begin though. This and the Immaculate Collection are not all but a good collection of big hits for Madonna. It's a fun, upbeat listen, something to get you on your feet and at other times, something to get you reflecting on your own views, opinions and life. For any Madonna fan, or simple a fan of pop, this is in my opinion an essential for your collection. This is Madonna through her may re-inventions. It leaves you wanting more which a great thing. Perhaps on down the line, she'll have enough material to release a greatest hits spanning her entire career that'll include all the hits that some fans noted are missing. Until then, this is a great start to revealing this pop star and cultural icon's influence on our culture.
0844663662|4.0|The novel Slaughter House Five is a great story.  It describes Billy Pilgrim's time travel and adventures throughout the whole book.  The writer kept me going and I could not put this book down.  It is definitely a reread and I look forward to reading more of Kurt Vonnegut's writing pieces.  Though, the reason I am giving this a four star, is because of the introduction.  The introduction did not have a good foundation, and lacked interest, though I enjoy Kurt Vonnegut's honest style of writing and I look forward to the next Vonnegut novel I will read.
0452282152|4.0|Usually when I find myself reading a book, I can't read for more than an hour at a time. When reading Girl with a Pearl Earring, I sat for about four hours striving to finish it. I have been extremely fascinated by artwork ever since I can remember, and this book kept me fastened with historical fiction of Johannes Vermeer being one of its characters. <BR>This book takes place in Delft during the 1600's, and casts a picture perfect imagery in your mind of what the town looks like. Griet, the main character, has become the maid of the painter, Vermeer's family. Griet is to leave her family, change her lifestyle, and be surrounded with a religion she does not find comfort in. She is to clean Vermeer's art studio and help around the house. Not everyone is pleased with the selection of this maid, including Catharina, Vermeer's wife, and Cornelia, a daughter of Vermeer. The book presents a pleasant plot that has different facets and boasts a visual image. <BR>This book gave me a perfect view of what everything looked like. His paintings were delicately described, when I looked them up after reading the book, they were surprisingly similar to my visions. A couple times in the book, Chevalier flashbacked to a time in which was already covered in the book. I found this to be both distracting and confusing. Although, it also brought some edge to the book, which in the end I found to enjoy this twist in format. <BR> I found myself questioning the authenticity of this story. Griet is 16 when she goes to work for the family, but somehow she is more experienced than everyone living there. For example, Griet shows Vermeer how to add a kick to his paintings, a twist to the eye. And at times it seems as if Griet is observing the whole story more than participating in it. Even though there were a couple slips in this book, I still found myself remarkably entertained.<BR>I had never read a book that took place in the 1600's and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  After readingthis book, I looked up paintings of Vermeer, and saw the movie, starring Scarlet Johansson. This book helped me to rediscover my love for art.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|the fakers have been revealed. open your eyes and ears and witness slipknot at its finest. this is a huge leap forward for slipknot i didnt expect this album to be this powerfull and advanced. obviously it took alot of people by suprise and for those who dont see the greatness of this album we dont need you. slipknots last two albums are disposable after awile, this album is extremely powerfull will leave a lasting impression on you.
0062502182|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read, especially in this time of world conflict.  While I'm not sure that every sentiment could withstand close scrutiny, it should enable any reasonable reader to do some worthwhile thinking.  Long ago in French class we read &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot;, and if there were a Portuguese class at the same level, this would be the book for it.  Some confuse literariness with sesquipedalianism, but this author is not one of them.
B00018D44U|5.0|I was surprized that this CD has lots of bad reviews the first time I listened to it it seemed very mellow to me but it really grows on you there are a few great songs on here and the rest are very good. Its on the edge of folk/country reminds me a bit of Nancy Griffith and Michelle Shocked It is a very good CD It is mellow but her voice is much matured on this CD its different yes But Very Very Good .
B000002N3N|5.0|Music from Heaven; her songs touch your soul like none can.
B000001FE0|5.0|I'm in agreement with the unanimous reviews: this is one of the Bee Gees best efforts, and my personal favorite (a close second to &quot;Cucumber Castle&quot;).<br />To anyone who has derogatorily and incorrectly defined the Bee Gees (and there are many) as a disco phenomenon, listen to this CD and realize what true fans have come to embrace about the group.  The music and lyrics are lush, complex...the harmonies and arrangements, simply beautiful.<br />Though this concept album was riddled with production/creative issues that resulted in a less than ideal conceptual release, there remains a cohesive element that makes it a success nonetheless.  Several reviewers have commented that some of the tracks were not conceptual and were added to the album  more or less as filler, resulting in a &quot;missing element&quot; feel to the album.  For me, this has added to the mystery and mood of the album: (i.e., why would a shipwrecked sailor think about &quot;Edison&quot;...why not??).<br />Whatever the history of this album, it is a masterpiece and in a class by itself.  It achieves a beautiful yet melancholy mood that makes you feel like you are living in the sea-faring past of old England, each song a voyage in itself.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|The solos are the most intense of any VH album.  &quot;Fair Warning&quot; was when all the stars aligned for Eddie's playing, and the rest of the band follow suit.  <BR>This is also the darkest of the VH albums.  With &quot;Tora Tora&quot; soundling a little bit like Mercyful Fate, and &quot;Sunday Afternoon&quot; is a very atmospheric dark synth composition (almost goth).<BR>Michael Anthony lays down hulking funky grooves and great backing vocals, Alex keeps pace and puts in fills that accentuate the whole rhythmic statement of each song.  Dave smothers the songs with tender loving raspy sleeze, thus seasoning this volume of the devil's music to utter perfection.
6305971935|4.0|\\"The Philadelphia Experiment\\" is supposedly the about an experiment the U.S. Navy conducted in 1943 to make the U.S.S. \\"Eldridge\\" invisible to radar.  However, the experiment goes (surprise) horribly wrong and the ship is contaminated with a deadly dose of radiation.  Two of the sailors, David Herdeg (Michael Pare) and Jim Parker (Bobby Di Cicco), jump overboard as their crewmates are catching on fire and getting trapped in bulkheads and end up traveling through a rift in time to 1984 (i.e., the present in terms of that being the year this movie was made).  One of them gets sent back but the other does not and not only are the authorities after him but it seems that pesky hole in time is wrecking havoc with the climate (not as bad as \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" but serious enough).<br /><br />This is a fun little B-movie that most science fiction fans can enjoy as long as they do not take it too seriously.  The reason it is considered to be based on a \\"true\\" story is that it is based on a 1979 \\"non-fiction\\" book that claimed the Navy was fooling around with Einstein's Unified Field Theory and sent the \\"Eldridge\\" from Philadelphia to the harbor in Norfolk, Virginia, and then back again.  The story is based on some dubious evidence and apparently since the U.S.S. \\"Eldridge\\" never ever docked at the Philadelphia Naval Yard the title appears to be suspect as well.  The Navy has offered an official explanation that what happened was a routine degaussing of the ship, which meant it was surrounded with electrical cables to negate the magnetic field (the idea is that it would render the ship invisible to radar but not to human eyes).  Of course to some people this explanation just screams cover up.<br /><br />Ultimately this film is not concerned with the \\"science\\" of the so-called experiment because that is all just an excuse for a more traditional time travel story and within that genre there are few interesting things going on here.  There are some fun moments as Herdeg encounters the brave new world (Orwell's \\"1984\\" did not come out until 1948, so he does not know that the future is brighter than people had thought in the 1940s).  Herdeg hooks up with an airhead, Allison Hayes (Nancy Allen), who eventually comes to believe that he is not lying about when he is from and tries to help him get back home.  It is just as well because there is really no chemistry between these two.  After \\"Eddie & the Cruisers\\" and \\"Streets of Fire\\" we all thought Par' was going to have a career, but this film seems to have derailed it.

B000255LIY|4.0|It is impossible for me to watch this Showtime remake of \\"The Lion in Winter\\" starring Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart without constantly comparing it to the 1968 theatrical film with Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole.  That was the first Hepburn film I ever saw and the way she delivers James Goldman's great lines (my favorite would be \\"I could peel you like a pear and God himself would call it justice!\\") is forever etched in my brain.<br /><br />However, I also think that it is clear that the specter of the original film hangs over the entire cast of this production.  By that I mean that it seems like every single memorable line from the play (and there are literally dozens) is delivered in a decidedly different way.  Specifically, Close plays Eleanor of Aquitaine as being much more emotional, which is rather ironic given that her ex-husband, the late King of France, is described as being a weeper.  This means that when Eleanor has what should be her final emotional collapse at the end of the film, it is really just another in what has been a series of emotional moments.  As for Stewart, his Henry II tends to underplay all of the key moments.  It certainly seems that every time O'Toole engages in bluster and bombast, Stewart goes quiet, bordering on a whisper.  Again, I can only conclude that these were conscious choices because they stand out so boldly against the original film version.<br /><br />This is not to say that I am against new productions of the play.  I would have loved to have seen Robert Preston and Rosemary Harris on Broadway or the Roundabout Theater production starring Laurence Fishburne and Stockard Channing.  But Stewart and Close make choices, obviously endorsed by director Andrei Konchalovsky, that remove much of the fire from Goldman's brilliant dialogue.  For those who have never seen a production of \\"The Lion in Winter\\" they may get a sense of the high quality of the drama, but I do not believe they get the complete picture.<br /><br />\\"The Lion in Winter\\" takes place during Christmas 1183, when Henry II, King of England, summons family to his castle in Chinon, France.  At issue is the question of who will be Henry's successor to the English throne.  Henry wants his youngest son, John (Rafe Spall), while Eleanor supports their eldest surviving son, Richard the Lionheart (Andrew Howard), which leaves middle son Geoffrey (John Light, in what I think is the best performance because I like his spin on the character).  Also along for the ride are Henry's mistress, Alais Capet (Yuliya Vysotskaya), who is supposed to marry the heir, and her brother, Philip (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), the young King of France.<br /><br />The chief attraction here is that while Henry and the rest play out their power games through a series of confrontations, feints, compromises, and sudden reversals they are delivering their lines with an extraordinary level of insight, wit, and irony.  That is, of course, provided they are delivered so as not to undercut the power of the lines.  The confrontations between Henry and Eleanor are supposed to be a clash of heavyweights and the cast here is dropping down in weight class.es place during Christmas 1183, when Henry II, King of England, summons family to his castle in Chinon, France.

B00005JLR8|5.0|I missed IN AMERICA when it was in the theaters, and I vowed not to miss it when it was released in DVD. The reviews of the film were excellent, and I knew I would enjoy an Irish family moving to the United States. I decided to purchase the DVD rather than rent it, knowing that when I saw it I would enjoy it, complain about a few clich&eacute;s, and put it away to view it again in a year or so. I certainly expected it to be somewhat lighter fair, in the same category as WAKING NED DIVINE. I was hardly prepared for the dramatic intensity of the film.<br />The story tells of a young couple, Johnny and Sarah Sullivan (Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton respectively) who move from Ireland to New York with their two daughters after the tragic death of a younger son. The parents are too busy trying to care for the children to attend to their own grief which provides for much of the film's conflict. The two daughters Christy and Ariel, played by real life sisters Emily and Sarah Bolger, are endearing, and see a magical side to an area of New York most people would avoid at all costs. This seems to be due less to the fact that they have left rural Ireland for the big city (Dublin, Belfast, Cork, and Limerick have their share of seedy neighborhoods infested with drugs and poverty), but rather it is due to their outlook on life. The family befriends a neighbor who is dying from AIDS who allows the family to deal with its own loss and celebrate life once again.<br />While the plot of this movie has been retold in many different ways in film and literature, IN AMERICA has many qualities that make it outstanding. Writer and director Jim Sheridan is able to capture the girls' innocence remarkably well. Johnny and Sarah are authentically Irish yet they have a universal appeal. New York City is colorful even in the midst of pain and tragedy. Family life is celebrated yet the conflicts are real. Perhaps what made this film most outstanding in my eyes is that even though I instinctively knew how the film would probably end, it still held my interest and had a degree of suspense to it. This only happens when a film captures a viewer's heart while respecting the viewer's intelligence.new how the film would probably end, it still held my interest and had a degree of suspense to it.

B000002L5P|5.0|This is my favourite Smiths album(not counting compilations). I'm not alone in this either; a Rolling Stone article agreed with me, and so does Mark Simpson, author of 'Saint Morrissey.' (OK, now I probably sound like a Smiths fanatic, but I'm  not, I promise; I just happen to like intelligent, accessible, and enthusiastic writing about popular culture!) I admire 'The Queen is Dead,' and 'Strangeways' and 'Meat is Murder' have their many virtues. If you fell in love with 'The Queen is Dead,' it's possible you may not like this as much, because it's quite different. If, however, you liked 'The Queen is Dead' but came away not fully understanding the fuss over this band--try this, as well as (and perhaps first)'Hatful of Hollow,' a radio sessions and B-sides compilation that has better versions of some of these tracks plus more great songs in the same vein.<br />Popular music history has been unkind to The Smiths' debut album because the band had already generated enormous expectations before they even released an album and because the legendary poor production apparently failed to do justice to the songs' potential as proven in live performances. This is pure dusty, cobwebbed abstraction to those who discovered The Smiths after they split up, like me. I consider the unpolished nature of the production and of Morrissey's riveting and unearthly voice at this stage an aesthetic enhancement, perfect for these songs about romanticized desolation and squalor. The theme of the album (intended or not) is the passage from innocence to experience through sex or trauma (or traumatic sex), conveyed through ambiguous, evocative and suggestive lyrics that hint at kinkiness without ever being vulgar or sensationalistic. The entirely unique imaginative universe Morrissey introduces the listener to manages to convincingly blend the ordinary and the exotic, allowing the listener to identify but still be intrigued. Johnny Marr's haunting, delicate, achingly melancholy compositions beautifully assist in conjuring this universe. No, not every song is a masterpiece--but 'This Charming Man,' 'Still Ill,' and 'Reel Around the Fountain' are, 'The Hand That Rocks the Cradle' and 'Suffer Little Children' are must-hears, 'Miserable Lie,' the album's one rock-out, is an insane experience (sort of 'Helter Skelter' with a hoarse falsetto and opposite lyrical content), and the others are seriously catchy, lyrically original guitar-pop.<br />There's already plenty of self-mocking irony at work in Morrissey's lyrics, but it's after \\"Hatful\\" that his work becomes largely divided into novelty songs and flamboyant melodramas, with some crossover, while Marr becomes increasingly experimental and rocks harder and the production gets slicker. However, this is like arguing about whether The Beatles are better circa 'Revolver' or 'Sgt. Pepper'--buy all the albums, this is one of the greatest bands in pop/rock history.utifully assist in conjuring this universe.

B000001GXJ|5.0|Ask ardent Verdi fans to name their five favorite Verdi operas, it is likely that SIMON BOCCANEGRA will be on the list. This opera contains some of Verdi's most beautiful music which is able to convey the drama of this great work. Sadly, the work is somewhat unknown. There are no show stopping arias, well known choruses, and the duets rarely are recorded or performed outside of the opera itself. The work was a failure at its premiere, and was later revised by Verdi and the great librettist/composer Arrigo Boito. The revival was somewhat successful, but the opera did not endear itself to audiences. Unfortunately, the opera is not performed as often as it probably deserves, except at major opera houses such as The Metropolitan Opera in New York where it is staged on occasion.<br />The plot of the opera is grand in scope, and there are some empty spots in the libretto which does not help the work. The story contains political intrigue in fourteenth century Genoa, conflicts in love, and tangled familial relationships. While the plot may be complicated (though not convoluted as is the case of so many operas), the characters are perhaps the most compelling in all of Verdi's opera. The title character is powerful, yet flawed, and his tenderness is evident when he discovers that he has a long lost daughter Amelia. Fiesco, Boccanegra's sometimes enemy has the kindness and wisdom that come with age, though he likewise has his flaws. Gabriele, Amelia's love interest and Boccanegra's young political rival, is young and impetuous, but has personal insight which keeps him from becoming a tragic hero. Some would argue that the Verdi, who is known for his portrayal of fathers, is at his best with Boccanegra when he discovers his daughter Amelia.<br />Unlike Verdi's better known operas, there is not a plethora of studio recordings of this work, but this recording under the direction of Claudio Abbado sets a high standard that would be difficult to emulate, speak less of surpassing. Each principal performer; Piero Cappuccilli as Boccanegra, Mirella Freni as Amelia, Nicolai Ghiuarov as Fiesco, Jose Carreras as Gabriele, and Jose van Dam as Paulo are in their vocal prime and are able to create the dramatic intensity through their voices that make this opera a masterpiece. The opera was recorded in conjunction with a mid-1970's production at Teatro alla Scala in Milan which gives this recording the benefit of the authenticity of a live performance and the perfection of a studio recording.<br />I may never see this opera performed on stage, but when I listen to this recording, I am transported to an opera house due to the dramatic power and sheer energy of this recording. Since its re-release, it is now a mid-priced recording, which makes it even more of a bargain.Each principal performer; Piero Cappuccilli as Boccanegra, Mirella Freni as Amelia, Nicolai Ghiuarov as Fiesco, Jose Carreras as Gabriele, and Jose van Dam as Paulo are in their vocal prime and are able to create the dramatic intensity through their voices that make this opera a masterpiece.

While the previous two movies were superb, but sometimes lacking, this one is just absolutely GREAT. A must-see.
B0000029GA|5.0|I purchased this album in 95 and must say the Hip-hop is in no way, shape or form the way it used to be.  Hip-hop should not be about satisfying all listeners.  Presently, A great deal of MC's use hip-hop to showcase thier material things and party antics.  To me, hip-hop is rhyming about life to people who want to listen.  It's about showcasing pure talent.  It is ironic to me that one of Nas' most provocative albums also brought him the least amount of success.  There a many theories as to why this happened, but the fact of the matter still stands, he recorded this album w/ hip-hop in his heart.  Undeniably, the record does have an old school vibe, but you must keep in mind that it was recorded in 94.  Still, you will notice that it is ahead of it's time.

B0001AP12G|5.0|I'd say that this is one of the best cd's that I have heard from all genres.  Kanye brings his beats and his lyrics together to form the best cd of the year.  <br />songs on the CD<br />Get em High-  Best song by far, the beat is tight and the lyrics are too.  Talib Kweli and Common contribute to the song and makes it a good solid club banger. 10/10<br />Jesus Walks-  Best song lyrically on the song.  This song is going to be huge once he makes a music video for it and it is already out on the radio. Kind of short though shortest song that he raps on on the album. 9.5/10<br />Two Words-  It's not really Kanye's style it's a little too hardcore but it is still a very good song with Freeway and Mos Def. 9.5/10<br />We Don't Care- Brings humor to the album from the beginning.  9/10<br />Family Business-  Brings back the whole feeling of the cd after the hardcore Two Words and hot single Through the Wire. 9/10<br />All Falls Down-  Iwas upset to find that this would be his first single following the release of his album because i would have preferred Get Em High or Two Words but it is still a good song featuring Syleena Johnson. 9/10<br />Never Let me Down-  Jay-z makes this song good with his verse at the beginning and the end.  Kanye also contributes telling stories of his mother when she was a child and his girls father. 9/10<br />The New Workout Plan-  Funny song, it has too much fill at the end but the girls stories about their use in the middle of the song makes it okay to add the end section 8.5/10<br />Spaceship-  Kanye tells his story about working at the gap- Great song but it's 5:24 and the verses after Kanye's by GLC and Consequence are pretty weak.  8/10<br />Last Call-  Great lyrically and the part at the beginning but its hard to listen to the full song more than once because he tells a story for about 8 minutes but if it were just the beginning it would be a 9.5 but instead an 8/10<br />School Spirit-  Good song but it is censored even on the Explicit Version of the cd for some reason 8/10<br />Slow Jamz and Through the Wire-  They were great songs but were very overplayed for months 7.5/10<br />Breathe in Breathe out-  Could have been better.  If ludacris had contributed a verse instead of just a chorus that Kanye wrote it would have been a hit like &quot;Yeah&quot; or &quot;Holidae Inn&quot; 7.5/10<br />There are many skits and singing songs on it but none the singing songs aren't Kanye and the skits get stupid after about 2 times listening.

0385504209|2.0|Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code purports to be an brainy thriller of the same stripe as Umberto Eco's [[ASIN:015603297X Foucault's Pendulum]] or Iain Pear's [[ASIN:1573227951 An Instance of the Fingerpost]], but it isn't, quite: it's a stupid - very stupid - thriller spliced with rather a lot of meticulous (I'm not sure I'd necessarily stretch to \\"brainy\\") research on some cloak and dagger Christian stuff.<br /><br />The research side is interesting enough, to be sure, and had Dan Brown set out to write and idiot's guide to Christian Symbolism in art and literature (i.e., had he left the thriller element out of it altogether), I'd have been more charitable in my assessment of his book. It is good meaty, controversial stuff. I couldn't give a fig whether it's true or not, to be honest, as long as it gets up the nose of the religious authorities, which apparently it has. Kudos to Mr. Brown for that.<br /><br />But the thriller? Dear, oh dear. There's not one element of it that passes muster.<br /><br />Firstly, the characterisation is astoundingly weak - so weak that it completely undermines the unfolding plot.  The gating question Dan Brown fails to answer is this: why would a four-by-two, dull-as-ditchwater university beak, actually do any of this?<br /><br />Next, the dialogue throughout is awful (a large contributor to the woodenness of the characterisation) and about three of the characters seem to \\"chime\\" everything rather than saying it. Grrr.<br /><br />Then the plot, however you look at it, is plain ridiculous. We asked to believe that, among other things (NB the following aren't really spoilers):<br /><br />* pillar-of-respectability Robert Langdon, a world-renowned Harvard professor of symbolism, before even informally being accused of a crime he manifestly could not have committed, would seek to run from local judicial police (instead of co-operating with their inquiries) to the extent of (among other things) hot-wiring an armoured truck, breaking through police lines in a borrowed Range Rover and fleeing French airspace in an illegally chartered plane.<br /><br />* the murder victim's grand-daughter Sophie - estranged from said victim for ten years (as a result of witnessing him participate in a bizarre sex cult) and a complete stranger to Langdon, herself an employee of the French Police's cryptology department to boot (convenient, eh wot?) - would be the prime mover in Langdon's decision to do, and his main accomplice in doing, this, thus (one would think) completely obliterating her own career in public service in the process for the sake of a dead man she manifestly thought was a pervert.<br /><br />* on the run from the French judicial police (as well as a rather nasty bovver boy from Vatican hardliners Opus Dei), said professor would frequently stop and deliver lengthy homilies to said granddaughter about L. Da Vinci, the Priory of Sion, the Merovingian Kings, the Knights Templar and all the other usual suspects of Christian legend.<br /><br />* The point of the pair's flight from justice is apparently not to prove Langdon's innocence, nor solve the actual murder themselves, but instead to find - on this night, of all nights - documentary proof of the last resting place of the most Holy Grail itself.<br /><br />* that this, along with all other action in the novel (and there's plenty more, you may rest assured) takes place in the course of one uninterrupted evening. About four lines in the novel suggest that Sophie and Robert may also get it on. What a busy pair!<br /><br />Now I know fiction is all about the suspension of disbelief, but this is ridiculous. We are introduced to an increasingly ludicrous array of plot-functional characters as the drama goes on, whilst Brown spoon feeds his hysterical theories of Christian cover-ups, secret societies and hidden symbols by way of unsolicited authorial essay, pompous soliloquy (usually delivered, as noted, in the teeth of approaching police and/or bovver boys), or straight-out travelogue. There are pages of The Da Vinci Code that read like [[ASIN:0312385811 Let's Go Paris]].<br /><br />Where the opportunity really knocked was to fold the symbolism Brown has researched into the text of the novel itself. This is what sets apart the likes of Umberto Eco - real skill in the craft of writing. None is in evidence here. There is no figurative structure at all, which is remarkable for a book all about hidden codes, so it is really a straight out holiday page-turner.<br /><br />Which is why the masses like it, and have bought it in their droves: The Da Vinci Code is a dead easy read, but one can feel the achievement of having read (and understood!) a book described on its cover as \\"erudite\\".<br /><br />Makes me sound like a snob, doesn't it?<br /><br />So be it.<br /><br />Olly Buxton312385811 Let's Go Paris]].

I bored quickly of the predictable rhymes of an eighth grade poet. Listen to &quot;He Wasn't&quot; and &quot;Fall to pieces&quot; and tell me you don't know every line that is coming.<br />She needs to take some lessons from Fiona Apple, Veruca Salt, and Alanis. All sang with real emotion and they all know what a metaphor is. Avril's singing lacks both the complexity and the sincerity that could make her music great. <br />But, maybe I am forgetting what her demographic is.<BR>Avril will succeed in part because there are not many competitors in the teen angst department of pop music these days. But if you want to hear some young women rock with emotion see if you can dig up Fair Verona's album.

You can credibly believe the cruelty being doled out by both sides - neither Irish or English side is idolized as being the righteous one - and the pure shock will have you shaking just as much as the characters on screen.<br />The relationships here are beautiful, whether they're platonic (Michael's dealings with Harry, his best friend, and De Valera who in certain places would have you believe that they are like brothers) or romantic (with Kitty Keirnan) and the reactions of the actors are fantastic - especially De Valera (Alan Rickman)<br />However, if you're looking for historical accuracy... read the history first. The film takes plenty of liberties, to the extent of having one attack in Croke Park (Pairc Ui Crochaigh) that never actually happened and inaccuracies in the manner of some deaths.<br />And good gracious, someone kill Julia Robert's voice coach! <br />If you'd like to sit down with a moving film that never lets up, Michael Collins is perfect ^^;;
6303159966|5.0|Cujo is one of those great Stephen King movies. The book translates well into film (sure, the ending is different, but while the one ending is right for the book, this ending is right for the film). The acting is superb. The writing is great and believable. The direction and cinematography is great. Dee Wallace is wonderful as is Danny Pintauro (who played Tad), but the true star were the five St. Bernards, the one mechanical head the the guy in the suit that played Cujo. A lot of King's books have trouble making it to film. Cujo isn't one of those.

6304618344|4.0|This John Woo action movie doesn't really bring any great surprises to the table, but it is a highly entertaing, and well done film. You have to excuse the believability of it first of all, but after that you can sit back and enjoy it. Cage gives a good performance. Alessandro Nivola, who plays Pollux Troy, gives a great performance. And Travolta gives a five star, truly remarkable performance. He mimics Cage perfectly. Travolta truly shows how great of an actor he is here. This is one action movie I do recommend.
B00005JMH2|4.0|\\"Shall We Dance?\\" (2004) is a remake of the superb Japanese musical dance comedy which was released in the U.S. in 1997. This new version stars Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon and Stanley Tucci. There's not a chance in the universe that this new version will be better than the Japanese classic, which was just about as perfect as any film has ever been, ever. But I'll definitely go to see the new one, only because it probably will be very enjoyable to compare the two versions, and any dance film is better than none. Plus I think I'll really enjoy the new one--it's just that I KNOW it could never approach the Japanese original, for many reasons. Sure, they'll try to adapt the screenplay to American customs and vernaculars, but many charming nuances of the original will be lost because it will not take place in Japan, and the original was really about how the Japanese are relating to something very Western and alien, ballroom dance. If you want, you can go to Hollywood.com and watch the preview to the new version. Just type in Shall We Dance? in the Search field. The preview is pretty good. I will enjoy the film, but I strongly urge you to buy a copy of the original \\"Shall We Dance?\\" here on Amazon, and also go to the \\"Shall We Dance?\\"(Japan) Amazon DVD page and vote to have it released on DVD. It's a crime this hasn't happened yet! (I gave this American version 4 stars, because I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt, also based on the preview I saw).
6302516919|4.0|for some reason i thought this movie was only mediocre, but then i rewatched it, and to be honest, it is quite good. john carpenter did a good job making it. good acting, good effects. good job overall. quite enjoyable.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I preordered this album May 8th strongly believing that I would greatly enjoy this album. I sure did enoy it, and I'm glad I bought it, especially after hearing it on &quot;The Leak&quot; on MTV and was so excited to hear it when I found out about it a week before it was released.<br />However, I can't understand why a lot of the reviews I read hated Avril so much - Someone mentioned that UK always liked it - no one there submited bad mouthing of Avril &amp; her music - A lot of US people wrote hate of it. I'm from the US, but I'm part English, and I am geographically closer to England than most people in the US (Coast of Maine), so I don't know if that has to do with why I like her music or not or I just happen to like her music. But anyway, people shouldn't post comments about music they don't like just because they don't like her style of music. Everyone should respect other's tastes, and not to ruin a good rock album's popularity just because they only liked classical music. People like that should have listened to previews of her music or on the radio and not be dumb enough to buy something they didn't like and post a bad comment about it just to scare off other rock/Avril lovers from buying the good, worthwhile albums they'd actually like.<br />I love the new songs, it's way better than Let Go. I like Avril's personality and how she is so against guys trying to push her into doing things she shouldn't and people telling her what to do and what not. She wrote her lyrics and music herself this time unlike last time by virtualy having others rewrite it for Let Go. The change is good. When I clicked the &quot;Process Order&quot; button for this album, I was hoping I wouldn't regret wasting my money - I didn't, and I never will!<br />She used Pianos this time as well as guitars like before, and the mix of them really makes a difference. The songs are very emotional, like Together, Forgotten, How Does It Feel, and Slipped Away.<br />Avril has done very well with hernew album. Amazon Sales rank was 67 when I preordered, then 37, then #1, which made me happy and I strongly believe that this will be a debut album much better than debut &quot;Let Go&quot;. If not, I just might rush off and live in the UK where it will be because I should be there with Avril Fans but not here with Avril haters. I can socialize there without someone shouting &quot;Avril? She's not music!&quot; like what someone at high school said to me (insultingly).<br />Way to go, Avril! Keep up the good work and singing! I wonder what your next album will be like - can't wait to hear it!
6302824729|4.0|I felt Avildsen's followup to The Karate Kid was slightly better than his initial film. The story was much fuller and the fight scene was better. The characters were more developed and the karate was better choreographed. Unlike the flop of a third film, the second is really good.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think is the best pop album of the year.. I mean, this album is no way BORING.. she cowrite 7 tracks of 12.. In The Zone is full of great dance tracks like \\"Toxic\\" \\"Breathe On Me\\" \\"Early Mornin'\\".. to the sexy \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" wich is the best song on the album; is a trip-hop song with Britney in her best.. also have hip-hop songs like \\"I Got That (Boom Boom)\\" and \\"Outrageous\\". In addition are two ballads.. \\"Shadow\\" and \\"Everytime\\" with EXCELLENTS lyrics by Britney.. full of substance.. I love that 2 tracks. If you wanna hear something different, you have yo Buy This Album.. it's perfect.. ur not gonna regret this!!!!
0393039765|5.0|This book could be called nothing other than a cult classic. It inspired one of the greatest films of all times (another cult classic), and while it isn't as good as the movie, it is a pretty great book. Full of satire, political commentary and philosophy. A book well worth reading.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This CD is slipknot. They've changed, of course they have. It's not the same exact sound as they've used before, which is good cause they aren't photocopying their old songs. This album shows off more guitar talent then the previous CD's have, and some Stone Sour-ish elements have been thrown in (that should be kind of obvious), but this cd still kicks ass. If you like Slipknot, you'll like this CD.
B00000490M|4.0|This 1984, 'modern classic' by director John G. Avildsen (&quot;Lean On Me&quot;; &quot;8 Seconds&quot;) is a solid movie--very entertaining. I'll admit there is nothing truly spectactular about it. Robert Kamen's (&quot;The Fifth Element&quot;) writing is good, but nothing truly great. Macchio and Morita put in solid performances. The karate is only mediocre, but the principles aren't exactly martial arts experts. Still, it is one of those films I fondly remember as a child, and one I can still go back to all these years later. It holds up over time.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|This was the worst excuse for a movie!  A plot that really made no sense, this movie seemed to be made so that we could see how cute Russell Crowe looked in uniform and enjoy the battle scenes.  While I love, and own, several of his other movies, I totally disliked this movie, and will probably not watch it again, let alone recommend it to others.  It's so bad, that I'm sure Russell Crowe could not have actually READ the script before he agreed to do the film.

B0000035E7|5.0|This is a great nirvana album for a debut.  Its raw and is loose and relaxed unlike the later nirvana recordings.  It has some of the best nirvana songs like blew, negative creep, &amp; love buzz.  It may not be as developed as nevermind or in utero but bleach is definitely one of the best early grunge albums of all time.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is a very diverse album.  Christina has a beautiful voice (eventhough I think she strains her voice a lot).  I am very proud of her for coming out with this CD.<br />She displays great songwriting abilities.  I look forward to hearing more.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I just purchased this album a few months ago, and have been listening to it nearly every day since. I love how The Clash manages to blend so many styles into their songs. Sandinista! may have more diversity, but London Calling just has stronger and faster paced tracks. Standouts are Hateful, Rudie Can't Fail, The Right Profile, Clampdown, Guns of Brixton, Wrong em' Boyo and Revolution Rock. The only weak tracks are Brand New Cadillac and Lost in the Supermarket, but they are still tolerable and only become filler due to the greatness that surrounds them.

B0001FR3IQ|2.0|Somewhere in this gloomy picture they're may be a decent women's prison exploitation flick. But as a horror film, the movie seems unable to settle into a niche of the gender before abandoning it and exploring another. At once, film noir, simple detective, horrific, &quot;Gothika&quot; changes hands like a deck of flip cards out of chronological order, finally settling on a bizarre plea of social conscience. Before then the movie is often just flip. When a local newspaper's banner front page headline reads, &quot;Local Girl Commits Suicide&quot;, the fine line between black and white isn't grey, but completely colorless.

B0001XAS1W|5.0|Al Stewart's &quot;Year Of The Cat&quot; was one of my all time favorite albums alongside Cat Steven's &quot;Tea For The Tillerman&quot;. Al Stewart had a way of writing beautiful songs with a style all his own. Examples of standout songs are the title track &quot;Year Of The Cat&quot;, &quot;Lord Greenville&quot;, &quot;On The Border&quot;, &quot;Flying Sorcery&quot; and &quot;Broadway Hotel&quot;. His unique blend of folk and rock made him a favorite among listeners of Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, and Jim Croce. Thanks to Rhino Records the remastering makes a great cd even better. Buy it and remember just how awesome the music of the seventy's was (and still is).
B00020HEL6|5.0|Help me, I'm under Renee Olstead's spell! I've been playing her new CD for like the last 5 hours. This girl is the future of music!<br />I don't know jazz the way some people do so I can't comment on the specific solo music stuff, but it's all great. The band really cooks! But I was listening mainly to Renee's voice. She sounds a little like Betty Boop in Someone to Watch Over Me, doesn't she? Then she sounds a lot like Jewel on some tunes and a little bit of Norah Jones and Sheryl Crow, but mostly she sounds like herself. She really has an amazingly pretty voice that comes across as both strong and vulnerable.<br />The best stuff is her uptempo songs. She was born to sing this kind of music like Is You Is or Is You Aint my Baby. Her words just bounce along in perfect syncopation. I wasn't so impressed with Breakin' Up is Hard to Do because, in direct contrast, it drags along. A Love That Will Last is the best of the slow ones and it brings out the deepest emotions.<br />So ...... I took a break long enough to type this review. Now it's back to the music - Renee's music from which I may never recover!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Simply put, this CD is bad. I have no sympathy for anyone who buys this CD, because anyone who's dumb enough to spend money on this, gets what they deserve.<br />Everyone knows she can't sing. She tries to make up for it with dance moves stolen from Janet Jackson, but for those of us with brains larger than peanuts, it doesn't cut it.<br />In The Zone is Britney's pathetic plea to be taken seriously. Sorry Brit, this doesn't do it. She tackles more risque subjects with In the Zone, I guess she thinks it will win her new fans. The jury's still out on that one.<br />But despite her complete lack of talent, there are 2 good songs on the CD, but she isn't the good part. The 2 good songs both have great beats &amp; original sounds. Her singing is the worst part of both of them, but I can stomach it. Everyone knows &quot;Toxic&quot; by now, it's a great song. That's half the reason why this CD sold the way it did. The other is &quot;Showdown&quot;. Not sure what she was thinking when she wrote the lyrics, but the beat is amazing. She should release that song instead of the garbage &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;, &quot;Everytime&quot; (her ode to Justin), and &quot;I Got that Boom Boom&quot;. All 3 of those songs, along with all the other songs on the CD (minus Toxic &amp; Showdown), are terrible. <br />Save your money &amp; buy a more worthwhile album (Diary of Alicia Keys, Stripped, Damita Jo) from artists that know what they're doing.

B000002GQE|5.0|Still rated as one of the Best albums of all time the Moodys took us into a new dimension with the release of this album !!!!<BR>         The Second Phase of The Moody Blues <BR>It was hard to believe  a year before, back in 1966 the Moody's lost their Lead Singer Denny Laine who decided to leave the band  for a unsuccesful solo career ( but then found his way in Paul McCartneys Band Wings in 1971) along with Bassist Clint Warwick who also decided to quit !!! Two New Members were added Lead Singer Justin Hayward and Bassist John Lodge the Moody Blues hit the Jackpot with these guys, not only were they good musicians but Brilliant Songwriters to and brought a whole new style to the Band !!! Released in 1967 the same year as the Beatles Sgt Pepper this album to me was more of a concept album than Sgt Pepper in fact it really didnt take of in America until it hit the Billboard Charts 5 years later in 1972. A must have album to start if your not familar with the Moody Blues !!!!
B0001ENY6M|5.0|No one ever said that the duduk is an Azerbaijani instrument -- read more carefully. Not only did I <br />cite the relevant quote from the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, which I recite again below, but here's <br />my only quote relevant to the national belonging of the duduk: &quot;The instrument used, duduk, is an <br />ancient one used in the Caucasus, particularly in Western Azerbaijan&quot;.<br />The duduk musical instrument cannot belong to any one nation, it is neither exclusively <br />Azerbaijani, nor Armenian, nor anyone else's, but instead common in the Caucasus region and the <br />greater Middle East. There are some nation-specific variations, like &quot;Armenian duduk&quot;, Azerbaijani <br />duduk/balaban&quot;, &quot;Turkish dtidiik&quot;, etc., which all are duduk's. Although, we should consider the <br />following facts and evidence, proving the duduk to be slightly more relevant to Turks and <br />Azerbaijanis, than any other nation. <br />First, the word duduk is Turkish, as the relevant entry from the Great Soviet Encyclopedia (edited <br />by two Armenian academicians) and another Armenian source proves.<br />&quot;DUDUK (from the Turkish du:du:k), a wind instrument having a pipe about 300 mm in length with nine <br />fingerholes and a double reed. Usually two duduks are played--one performer plays the melody while <br />the other holds a single tone (the pedal point). The duduk is widespread among the people of the <br />Caucasus&quot; (Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd edition, vol. 8, 1973, in English, p. 438).<br />&quot;The word &quot;duduk&quot; seems to be derived from either the Turkish duduk, whistle, or the Russian duda, <br />pipe. The phonetic resemblance between the Turkish and Russian words is probably coincidental. The <br />word and minor phonetic variants are used throughout Eastern Europe, Russia and the Caucasus, but <br />the name in much of the earlier literature is applied to various forms of the Turkish duct flute<br />.... Thissometimes results in uncertainty as to the differences between duduk and dtidiik, in <br />other words, the differences between a Turkish flute and an Armenian or Georgian oboe. In addition, <br />the duduk is often referred to as an instrument of the Caucasus, an area that is home to over <br />thirty nationalities&quot; (from Arsen Grigoryan, a prominent Armenian duduk player).<br />Second, to prove the duduk predating Armenia and Armenians, here's a quote from an Armenian <br />propaganda source: &quot;The musical ancestors of the duduk existed as long ago as 4,000 years ago. <br />These musical instruments were found in Egypt, however, its use was more widespread in the <br />Caucasus.&quot; (Gayane Abrahamyan, ArmeniaNow magazine, June 13, 2003). <br />What material is the duduk best made from? &quot;From the informative folder we learn that the duduk's <br />body must be carved from the root of the apricot tree, while the reed -- called &quot;ramish&quot; or &quot;<br />yegheg&quot; -- is ideally cut from canes growing along the banks of the Arax river.&quot; (Again, an <br />Armenian source: Gevorg Dabaghyan, Miniatures: Masterworks for Armenian Duduk, Traditional <br />Crossroads, 2002). The Araxes river in the left bank mostly flows through Azerbaijan, and the <br />entire path of it along the right bank, the Iranian side, is populated by ethnic Azerbaijanis only. <br /> Same it is in history, ancient Armenian historians write that the southern border of Caucasian <br />Albania, the predecessor of Azerbaijan, is along the Araxes river -- naturally. <br />Finally, to show how common the duduk is in the Caucasus, let us remember that even Georgians have <br />the duduk as part of their culture and traditions, having two famous songs, &quot;Duduki&quot; and &quot;Duduko&quot;, <br />and many prominent musicians and theaters using the duduk (e.g., The Dancing Crane Georgian Dance <br />Theater presents Songs and Instrumental Music from the Republic of GeorgiaTraditional and City <br />Songs, Church and Classical Music).
1577311523|5.0|Eckard Tolle takes several tenets from universal philosophy, which can be found in different religions, but specially in buddhism. <br />If you are kind of analytical person that would like to know step by step the process of how to liberate our minds, find inner peace, and feel 100% responsible of our lifes this is an excelent option. <br />It is not an easy book, it might require time and previous self introspection. It will definetely require from us an unbearable life or thoughts which will be the driving force to get out of our hole and learn little by little how to live in a happier way. Let things happen the way they do is the &quot;magic phrase&quot; of the book, but the arguments that support it are what is meritorious of this book.<br />Excelent book ... After reading it I could breathe that humanity is evolving, out there are numerous books with this topic, with a different approach of course, but this shows evidence that humans, we are looking for the next step in trascendence besides this pragmatic life.
078401213X|5.0|Since I just recently reviewed director Darren Aronofsky's sophomore effort, I figured I might as well review this one too.<br /><br />I like it a lot myself, but it won't be for all tastes (even for all who like _Requiem for a Dream_). It's bizarre in all the right ways, but if you don't like things a little surreal, you won't care for this film.<br /><br />The setup is simple enough: Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is looking for 'patterns in pi' -- the famous transcendental number that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter and that (like Euler's number e) keeps cropping up all over the place in mathematical investigations of pretty much everything. Max is convinced that if he could grok that pattern (and through it, the underlying pattern of all of nature), he'd be able e.g. to predict the ups and downs of stock prices.<br /><br />Is he a 'mathematician'? Hardly. We do see some evidence that he's a lightning calculator, but -- despite some brief references to actual mathematics here and there -- Max's own 'investigations' look like the same sort of nonsense long perpetrated by pseudomathematical cranks. He's also subject to really nasty migraines that send him careening into hallucination. And yet -- his mentor Sol (Mark Margolis) suggests that at one time Max _was_ a promising and even brilliant mathematician, and at one point Max's stock market predictions appear to be uncannily accurate.<br /><br />Overall, though, Sol is on the mark when he implies that Max has gone in for numerology. Somebody else thinks so too, and regards that as a good thing: Lenny Meyer (Ben Shenkman), a Hasidic Jew who is investigating number patterns in the Torah in order to discern the Name of God. He gloms onto Max and starts teaching him not only about Torah observance (there's a nice scene where the two of them put on tefillin and start to recite the Shema) but also about Kabbalah -- specifically Hebrew numerology, a.k.a. gematria, although the film doesn't use that word. (The gematria stuff is accurately presented but, again, the math is not; at one point Max suggests -- and a rabbi appears to agree -- that the Hasidim have actually tried intoning the phonetic equivalents of every single possible 216-digit number, a feat that, with a hundred people at a time each intoning one name per minute, would have taken them on the order of ten-to-the-208th-power years.)<br /><br />There's also some corporate entity after Max's secrets as well. So Max, whose 'research' looks to be nothing more than sheer crankery, is nevertheless at the center of a whirlwind of conspiratorial activity for some reason. Is it because he's really onto something? Or is this all just -- a la _Foucault's Pendulum_ -- an echo of Eco?<br /><br />You probably won't be sure of the answer to that question even _after_ watching the movie -- even after watching it repeatedly. At least, after numerous viewing myself, _I_ still don't know exactly what's supposed to have transpired here. But some people (like me) enjoy that in a movie. (At any rate, the internal resolution of Max's distress works out about the same way on any interpretation of the external events.)<br /><br />The film was produced on a budget of, I think, about a dollar and eighty-seven cents, so don't be looking for ILM-level special effects here. The whole megillah is brilliantly shot in grainy black and white and backed with a spare, disturbing score by Clint Mansell. Gullette pretty much carries the entire film, with the help of an excellent but very small additional cast.<br /><br />This is, in short, the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing.

B00008EY9G|4.0|While I was sure that the theme of personality disorder was so exploited in all kinds of mystery books and movies that nothing new could be created on this theme, 'Identity' surprisingly brings a new twist to this subject. Just for this alone I would give it four stars. Add to this a very good actors ensemble, especially great perfomance by John Cusack, very fast pace of the movie (a lot of things are packed into 90 minutes, which could be good or bad) and good suspense. On the weak side, I felt that a movie plot was too much for me to handle - not because of its complexity (it's actually quite straighforward and logical) but rather because of too much action compressed in so short time. But maybe it's just me. Overall, recommended to anybody who likes thrillers with good suspense.
6305949980|5.0|Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, dissatisfied with his lot in life, decides to take over Christmas in order to bring shrieks of joy rather than terror to the people of the world.  He enlists the twisted denizens of his domain in his cause and it is rather touching to see their inadequate but sincere attempts to understand what brings delight to ordinary people.  As part of the plan, Santa is kidnapped, and the evil Oogie Boogie takes advantage of the situation to attempt a take-over of Halloweentown for himself.    This is a very amusing story told through the vanishing art of stop-motion animation.  The visuals are eye-popping, and I fervently hope that director Henry Selick and others will keep the form alive in the face of the onslaught of computer animation.  Danny Elfman's music is enchantingly sweet and catchy, but always a bit creepy and off-kilter as well--perfect for the material.  This world bears the unmistakable mark of producer/co-writer Tim Burton's unique imagination.  Highly recommended./

I had a roommate who played this lots, after hearing it in the 70s from his older siblings. I was hooked immediately. The production is occasionally slightly dated, as are a couple songs (&quot;Cindy Tells Me&quot; especially) but even at it's &quot;worst&quot; it's still fascinating. But at its best??? Simply put, I don't know that I've ever heard a record like this...it's utterly vital sounding in 2004, 31 years after its release. And for my money, if I had to pick the single catchiest guitar riff in history, it's the title track. If you've heard it...you know the one.<br />I came of age listening to indie rock in the 80s and 90s - yer Pixies, yer Pavements, Yo La Tengos, all dat. And this record sounds like it could be released today up against any of them. Buy it NOW!
B000002JSP|2.0|I was and am a huge Led Zeppelin fan.  I looked forward to the release of this album more than any other album in my entire life.  On first listen, I was disappointed; what happened?<br />After several hundred listens, I am of the opinion that John Paul Jones (and perhaps Robert Plant) realized the gravy train was grinding to a halt, and that they had better get another album out before Page and Bonham grew entirely unable to create music.  Hence the four album covers, etc.<br />This is a pleasant enough album.  But it nowhere approaches the high standard set by the band on their first six albums.

0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is a book that truly makes one wonder about the possibilities of literature. In reading the book, I found out that the theme is not that complex: basically, a tiger and a teenager named Pi Patel get trapped on a lifeboat for many days. This is the story of their survival. While at first, the reader's expectations would expect something magical, he/she will discover that Life of Pi is more like a reality TV show. The book goes into great detail about how Pi survives the unimaginably hostile circumstances (no water, food, salt, toilet facilities, and a 450 pound Sunderban tiger). Also, this book has more than a tinge of spirituality. This would be expected, as Pi later attributes his survival to his &quot;forgetfullness&quot; and belief in God. Moreover, Life of Pi would make a good beginner's guide to understanding the change from a human being to a castaway. Ultimately, I feel, it is the superb style of narration that will last in my mind for a long long time. I was more than once astounded about how much you can write about such a simple situation. But Martel accomplishes much more than masterful narration: he has a truly marvelous sense of humor (at times offensive). Now, after having read the entire book, I am still fascinated by mere thought of Pi's unforgettable journey.
B000001F26|5.0|Eric Clapton is the best!! I remember my fiance' dedicated &quot;wonderful tonite&quot; to me at my prom. So everytime that song cmes on, he sings it to me.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I'm a fan of all musical styles from all time periods, and this is the culmination of all Rock/Blues styles. The hit, the Strokes-ish 7 Nation Army is misleading. The album is much more sophisticated than that one song. Black Math is perhaps the best here, with its Hives-like riff &amp; Zep-like soloing. If you're a hard rock fan this isn't necessarily for you, because only 1/2 the songs are exploders, the other half being gentle &amp; even humorous (the last song). The magnificent Ball &amp; Biscuit is a blues stomper with the most impressive soloing I've ever heard - Hendrix quality! #13 &amp; #11 are dynamite garage-punkers. They'll make you groove. In contrast are songs that will melt your heart, but there is plenty of energy; even the gentle songs are not boring, they're actually very colorful. The range of styles &amp; emotions make Elephant the best Rock album of all time. I think one reviewer summed it up when he said &quot;it's like Raw Power with a G.E.D.&quot;
B000002UZ6|2.0|In this CD.  After I heard the poor quality of the recording and rendition of the songs I wished I could return it and get my money back!   Tiny sound and lots of static on the CD.  Also not the quality of performances I am use to w/Tina Turner in the past.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Before you stop reading and call me &quot;closed minded,&quot; keep in mind that I actualy have a good reason to why I dont like this cd.<br />People keep saying this cd is good because it shows a more melodic side to slipknot and shows off Corey's vocal range. That is stupid to say because both of the previous slipknot albums had five tracks that did just that. On the self titled there was Wait and Bleed, Me Inside, Prosthetics, No Life, and scissors. On Iowa there was My Plague, Gently, Left Behind, Skin Ticket, and Iowa. <br />The point is that each of the previous cd's also had tracks like this, the difference was that they were balanced out by tracks that were very hard and heavy. The self titled had a more raw energy feel, and Iowa had a more brut force feel. On this cd there is none of that, beyond the soft tracks there are about three or four songs that attempt to sound hard but come off as very forced and tame. The whole cd felt like Corey had to strain his voice to get across the lyrics, (which have very little variety on this cd.)<br />The other problem I had was that they relied a lot more on the guitars than on Joey. This was a mistake because the riffs here are nothing to brag about. On the previous cd's you never heard anyone saying good things about the guitars. They sounded good when Joey had his machine gun drums going in the background, but here they are very simple and repetitive. You would also never know that there was a sampler and DJ if you didn't know anything about the band itself. You could hear all of them on the previous two cd's, but here they relied only on about four members.<br />I am all for bands moving on to try something different, but I can see why this is Slipknots last cd, they just don't have the rhythm anymore. I am very glad that they had the great self titled and Iowa, so for that they are still one of my favorites. This isn't a bad cd overall, but compared to the previous two it is very lame. <br />good tracks are Virus of life, Duality, Blister exists, vermilion, and Opium of the people. I give it three stars because this cd is good. But its just a good cd, not great.
B00000DFSK|4.0|I agree with most of the reviews below. This is U2 Lite. A lot of great songs on All That You Can't Leave Behind isn't on this disc. SOngs like 'Kite', 'Walk On', 'Elevation' were the staple songs of the Elevation tour. I can't believe 'Running To Stand Still' isn't included on this disc, but well, this greatest hits collection is what got me hooked onto U2. So obviously it's worth the purchase. Because if you don't like the stuff on this CD, chances are you won't like U2. <br />One note though; October is included on this collection. Fast forward a little bit after All I Want Is You (The last track) and you'll hear it. One of the most beautifully melancholic tunes ever.
B0000CABBW|4.0|It is always interesting to get a slice of indigenous life, and Whale Rider offers a compelling look into Maori culture in New Zealand.  Keisha Castle-Hughes stands out as Pai, a teenage girl determined to take part in the coming-of-age rituals which she feels is her birth right.  The only problem is that she is a girl and has to get past her rigid Grandfather in order to do so.<br />The movie tries to balance modern-day realities against age-old customs, while offering an optimistic view of Maori life. It builds slowly to its dramatic end. Pai is dealt a cruel blow when her grandfather refuses to train her in the ancient rituals.  Her grandfather is the spiritual leader of the village and hasn't been able to overcome the fact that neither of his sons have been able to give him a grandson.  She had chosen to stay in the village rather than go off to Europe with her father.  Pai's grandmother offers some solace, but ultimately Pai has to take matters into her own hands when a pod of whales is left stranded on the beach.  She had learned the rituals from her uncle, who sees in Pai what her grandfather is unable to.  Pai has a natural calling for whales and feels it was her fault that the whales beached themselves.<br />The scenes are evocatively handled and one sees much of the beauty in Maori culture with very little of the harsh realities.  Niki Caro gives the movie the feeling of a parable, which should play well with young audiences.

The four leads, Ash, Lamott, Mitchell, and Bailey, remained, for page after tedious, self-indulgent page, nothing more than cyphers on a page, and painfully obvious writerly exercises.

One character speaks more or less like any other. A departion from this pattern, an American professor, is caricatured as using a lot of obscenities and being very hostile. She is fun, but very obvious. She sticks out like a sore thumb.<br />One exceptional character achieves life -- Beatrice Neff, a very minor, disliked, and irritating character, is vividly enough drawn that she did feel real to me.<br />\\"Possession\\" is shamefully BULBOUS.

I never felt a moment's tension for the fate of any of the lovers, or their works.

B0001DI0FI|4.0|I knew I should have viewed this movie in the theater, but listening to negative press about the movie, I decided to wait until the DVD came out.  What a mistake.  This movie ought to be seen on the big screen.  Somehow, my TV set did not do justice to Weirs incredible cinematography. <br />Having read almost all of C.F. Foresters Hornblower series, I was wondering if Weir could capture the atmosphere of a 19th century man-of-war.  I was not disappointed.  Perhaps the greatest strength of the movie was Weirs meticulous attention to detail. It was simply amazing.   Weir captured the nuances of 19th century naval warfare- crowded berths, the rotten food, and constant danger due to accident or war.<br />We can learn much about leadership from Master and Commander.  Leaders are paid to make decisions and many of those decisions are not easy to make- does Aubery rescue the drowning sailor, or risk his crew to save him? He lets the sailor drown.  Leaders just do not make decisions, they must motivate people to follow them.  As Master and Commander, Aubery motivates his crew to do the impossible, engage and defeat a much more powerful enemy.  <br />Was this a great movie? Not really.  The story line was weak, and it seemed to drag somewhat is the middle, but nevertheless, it was a very good movie.
B000000OQF|5.0|To put it simply, the careers of Axl Rose and co have been somewhat all over the place. A four track live album from 1986, combined with another four track album from 1988 and a 2 hour album split into two parts, as well as a live album compiled over 6 years of shows is hardly an outstanding discography. To say that none of the above discs are worth 4 stars, it is a testament to the power of this album that Guns n' Roses are still given legendary credence. From the aggressive, adrenaline charged opening of \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" to the beautifully tender closing of \\"Rocket Queen\\", it is arguably the greatest heavy metal album ever made. Rose screams out his tales of L.A.'s underbelly with an anger that could only come from a survivor of the booze, sex, drugs, crime and racism that dominates his world, while the gritty and raw interplay between Slash and Izzy Stradlin provide a suitable backing. There is not a single weak track on the album, and all of them contribute something unique to the album (note the heroin ode \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" and the sleaziness of \\"Anything Goes\\"). However, the most remarkable thing about this album is not the hostility of Guns n' Roses, but their ability to balance anger with sentiment, demonstrated to ample effect in \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\", \\"Think About You\\" and particularly \\"Rocket Queen\\".  A legendary release, and essential to any rock collection, or any music collection for that matter.
B000002A3T|5.0|Where Wish you were Here was a tribute to founding member Syd Barrett, The Division Bell is an examination of the situation between Waters and the Band at the time. The two stone heads facing each other on the cover pretty much sums up the problem: both camps were being stubborn and neither were budging. However, The Band recognized that communication needed to be restored and Gilmour did attempt to restore that communication with Waters, as summarized in the final verses of the second to last song, Lost For Words. While communication is the major theme running through the record, the internal band problems are suggested through various Floydian references all throughout the album. What do you Want From Me uses some of the funk grooves from Have a Cigar, while Gilmour asks Waters clearly if he wouldn't rather just take back complete control of the band again. Poles Apart starts out being about Syd and his descent into madness while the second verse (Hey You!) addresses Waters. The interlude uses sound effects of things that rotate on an axis, except for one snippet of a plane taking off from the original Atom Heart Mother performances, and then ends with Gilmours own self doubts about where he stands in the grand scheme of Pink Floyd and realizing in the end that his own personal life and love is where he keeps his sanity grounded. Marooned is a mood piece that suggests that impasse that people reach when they can't come to a good compromise. It's both sad and angry all at once. A Great Day For Freedom talks about different occasions of breakdowns that lead to new beginnings, again with the reference to the Floyd and it's total state of chaos by the end of The Wall project      (On the day the wall came down this ship of fools had finally run aground) and Waters  break from contract and the legal threat with all the court paper filings (promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight.) Wearing The Inside Out is a personal aside about Wright's own exile, both physically from the band, and mentally. Take it Back uses the analogy of how Mother Nature might one day take back the earth if we continue to abuse it, with how we all fight back against personal abuses and attacks and Coming Back to Life details the struggle to rise up after all of those attacks.<BR>Keep Talking expresses a regret for not saying something sooner before problems got out of control, whispered in an almost Waters like tone, while Lost For Words again details the battle of words and the attempt to patch things up that gets met with viscous words in return. High Hopes concludes things with a fond look back at happier days and the hope that those happier days aren't  completely lost in the past.<br />On a side note I want to address the issue of Gilmour and the slew of writers given credit on Momentary Lapse and to some small extent on this recording. Jon Carin said in an interview that he had made a sound with the keyboard that Gilmour liked and used it in the song Learning to Fly and then gave him a writing credit for it. Gilmour spent many years helping to form a lot of Waters' work without ever getting credit, only to find that now it has come back to haunt him because it looks like Waters did everything. So Gilmour decided to be fair and just with everyone and give any input a credit to the person who provided it. But you just can't win because now he's getting damned for that too, because it makes it look like he can't write anything without a lot of help, whereas Carin made a point that 99% of the Momentary album is Gilmours own writing. Being generous is just in his nature. Waters claims to be the exact opposite of Gilmour philisophically, and it certainly seems like it.<br />While Waters still continues to belittle Gilmour's work in Pink Floyd, and rewrites his own history of what happened in the band (these days he's saying he was forced out of the group!), The Division Bell is musically and lyrically a poetic observation on that whole mess andthe only perspective that seems to have the ring of truth about it.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Give 'em Johnny Cash!<br />From the opener &quot;Folsom Prison Blues,&quot; through the addictive (no pun intended) &quot;Cocaine Blues&quot; and the epitomy of gallows humor (&quot;25 Minutes to Go&quot;), this CD is a pure classic.  Through such classics as &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; and the powerful adultery/murder song &quot;Long Black Veil,&quot; you'll wonder how the CD could get any better.  When the humorous tunes &quot;Dirty Ol Egg Suckin Dog&quot; and &quot;Flushed From the Bathroom of Your Heart&quot; meet your ears, you'll think you're in heaven.  When June Carter lets loose her growled vocals on &quot;Jackson,&quot; you'll know your beyond heaven.  The pounding &quot;John Henry&quot; will hammer it in that you're listening to PURE COUNTRY MUSIC, while the closing &quot;Greystone Chapel&quot; (written by one of the inmates present at the concert) reminds you what this album is all about.<br />Wow.  That was a lot of words right there--but not enough.  You know who Johnny Cash is.  You've probably heard of this album before.  JOHNNY CASH AT FOLSOM PRISON is an album that you need--whether you're a fan of country, rock, disco, hip-hop, what have you.  Cash trascends typical musical genres.  Cash is a legend who will be sorely missed.  AT FOLSOM PRISON is just a small piece of his legacy--but it's a damn good piece.
0345409671|5.0|While i consider Anne Rice to be an exceptional writer, sometimes i find it hard to work through a few of her books. For example, i thought that The Vampire Lestat and The Tale of the Body Thief were really good stories, but i was wondering while reading when the next big development might happen to make the story progress. From what i read she tends to go alot into detail (not like that's a bad thing) and it sometimes loses me because i want to get into the story fast. That definetly wasn't the case with the detailed story called Memnoch the Devil.<br />The whole idea behind the story is Lestat meets the devil (of course, right?) and the devil gives him the choice of working with him or with God to end the religious battle that has been going on for centuries. To aid Lestat in his choice, the devil tries to pursuade Lestat into joining his side by telling him the story of creation and how he fell from glory up to the present day. Anne Rice does a wonderful job in writing this tale. I read over 2/3rds of this 400+ page book in one day, i absolutely could not put it down. <br />The way she describes things, her spin and her idea about the beginning of time and how the devil fell from grace is, while at times disagreeable, incredably interresting. While Memnoch is telling Lestat the tale he pulls both Lestat and the reader into the story. The book is well written and the way she portrays the creation is incredable. I recommend that anyone interrested in religion or faiths or in the series itself should read this book because it brings fourth not only and interresting story that will make you never want to drop the book when you hit page 182 but because of the controversy of her theory on creation. <br />In the end; read it, you will not regret it and, possibly even like me, this book may just become your favorite book in the whole series.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|I can't believe people like this stuff. It is the lowest, worst form of hip hop out there. I don't even want to call it hip hop, it is just pure crap. Don't waste your time with this garbage, go get yourself the new Ghostface album (Pretty Toney Album) or the new Vast Aire album (Look Mom, No Hands...) or the new album by Diverse (One A.M.) and find out what good hip hop is all about. God Eminem is bad when he wants to be, and D12 is just as sorry but without the promise to have some sort of talent.
B000007R1E|5.0|This classic album was the last the Moody Blues performed together before they temporarily split in 1972.  Later in 1978, Mike Pinder rejoined the group for the uneven album, \\"Octave\\", before he left forever.  This collection on DTS surpasses all other recordings in sound quality and depth.  Guitars barely heard before stand out and the percussion is spread about with distinct clarity.  Even the vocals are clearly separated but keeping the harmony.  The only other album the Moody Blues put on DTS is, \\"Days Of Future Passed\\" and they both sound like brand new recordings.  For those who never heard DTS surround sound, it is an event.  These sound systems are fairly low priced now.  I hope it's not too long before the entire Moody Blues series is released on DTS.
B000001GQQ|5.0|I cannot believe that David White and the so-called &quot;music fan&quot; are listening to the same CD the rest of us are!  This recording<BR>is what made a Martha Argerich fan out of me.  Her playing throughout this collection is just spell-binding and thoroughly amazing.<BR>Argerich has recorded the Prokofiev 3rd twice already, and a third recording is reported to be ready for release.  Each of them are as different from the others as can be.  The later one, with Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Symphony, is both more austere and more poetic than this one, but here we have the young Argerich, full of the fire, brio and self-confident daring<BR>and risk-taking which made her reputation.  Few other pianists would attempt to take the outer movements of the Prokofiev at the<BR>tempoes Argerich does here (FAST!).  To say that she pulls it off<BR>with abandon is an understatement!  The slow interior movement is<BR>as thoughtful and beautiful as anything you will find in Prokofiev, with notes falling from suspension like drops of water off icicles in the first thaw after a long winter.  The way Martha turns on a dime, from peaceful contemplation to firey<BR>agitation is something to behold.  She is so good, it's almost silly!<BR>As for the Ravel pieces, both solo and with orchestra, Argerich's<BR>affinity for Ravel's music and her ability to communicate its<BR>profound, yet subtle, emotional content is unsurpassed.  Nobody<BR>plays Ravel's piano music better than Martha Argerich.  They can only play it differently.<BR>If you are already an Argerich fan, why isn't this CD in your collection?  If you have yet to discover her artistry, this CD<BR>makes an excellent place to start.  Welcome to a larger universe!
B0001I55OC|1.0|Time travel is an exhausted movie theme.  Sometimes it works, but most times it doesn't.  Welcome to a time where it doesn't.  Michael Crichton's novel gets 'medieval' quality in this poorly executed film.  You can read the plot in the description above, but basically, several time travel students go back to 14th Century France to rescue their founder.  There are no great special effects and everything looks like a standard (or substandard) movie sound stage.  The acting is as wooden as the stage sets and every sincere attempt at emotion is embarrassingly tepid.  The medieval castle scenes resemble something Monty Python would assemble and the fighting scenes are cut so poorly that you never know who's hitting whom.  But that's being picky.  My biggest beef is the time machine.  It took years to invent and assemble and gets blown apart in a (really dumb) accident.  But, it is repaired within the six hour window needed to bring everyone back.  How's that again?  Well, this is Hollywood, not literature.  No need to discuss the extras other than to say there is no need for three documentaries on \\"Journey through Time\\".  Next film please.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I was not expecting the level of musicianship displayed on Vol 3.  Not having been a Slipknot fan before, I had heard &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; and lumped them in with standard &quot;Nu Metal,&quot; though I despise that term.  Creative and spirited musicianship, coupled with a flair for a melody (and when to avoid one) and complex and completely unorthodox arrangements make for a stellar and extremely listenable effort full of interesting surprises, for those inclined to the heavier side of modern rock.  This disc is slightly better than Mudvayne's &quot;The End of All Things to Come,&quot; and that's high praise.  Slipknot prove that their &quot;schtick&quot; is for fun, but when it comes to the music, they can certainly deliver.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|First of all I've liked Slipknot from day 1. Before their major label release. So all you nu-metal babies shut the F up. This album is for the most part crap and a MAJOR let down. If i wanted to listen to stone sour i would kept it when i got that. I liked Knot because of the power, aggresion, anger, pure heavy kick in the mouth metal. Now they just sound like good old radio friendly (most of the songs) nu metal crap.They do still get me pissed off and angry but not in the same way. When i heard Rick Rubin was producing this cd i thought nothing could go wrong. Low and behold another heavy band that made their $$$ and then went soft. If your going to Ozzfest skip Slipknot and check out the real metal bands like LAMB OF GOD, HATEBREED, EVERY TIME I DIE.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Best documentary EVER. Arnold mentions in the extras they called it a \\"docudrama\\" rather than a documentary, but it is--even if some if fictionalized. It's great, captures the essence of the sport and the drive to be the best. And Arnold's attitude brings along great humor!<br /><br />If you're a bodybuilder, a bodybuilding fan, a fitness enthusiast or a fat, out of shape couch potato, you need to watch this.<br /><br />If you're in shape, this will motivate you to step your training up a notch. If you're lazy, this will motivate you to get moving. There's no hype here, no fancy gyms, no marketing coming at you; this shows some of bodybuilding's best not as extremely large people, but as people who LOVE FITNESS. It's a great film you'll watch over and over.<br /><br />And with this DVD, the extra's are amazing. You'll probably find yourself watching those more than the actual movie!
B0001NBMBC|3.0|I had been waiting for this for quite some time.  I had anticipated and expected something as good, if not better, than Iowa which I consider one of my favorite CD's.  What I got was something that sounded to me as if thrown together for the sake of a waiting mass of fans.  Something promised that does not live up to it's potential.  <br />One thing I loved about Slipknot was the fact that they didn't sound like everybody else.  They were hard, yes, they were angry, yes, and their songs fit and flowed as if they just natually came to be.  Slipknot fit ME.<br />I supported them when it was time for side projects.  I enjoy both Murderdolls and Stonesour, but neither lived up to the Slipknot legacy.  I heard the rumors they were breaking up, I heard this was the last masterpiece...<br />I hope so.  Granted they've all been through a lot, and you don't really need to swear and scream to get the angst out or your point across.  But Vol 3 does have more of a Stonesour feel.  I found 4 songs that are ok (just my opinion) where as on Slipknot and Iowa I loved almost all the pieces presented.  These 4 songs are:<BR>The Blister Exists (the verses, chorus, bridges and riffs all flow nicely but I had to listen to it a few times to get the feel of it)<BR>Duality (this song was made for radio, that's plain to hear)<BR>Pulse of the Maggots (you KNOW this is going to be the \\"anthem\\" this year)<BR>Before I Forget (I have no idea why I like this song, I just do)<br />Everything else sounds to me like a jumbled mess of noise.  I liked noise in high school, that was 10 years ago.  I'm not sure if Circle was supposed to be like Wait and Bleed (Slipknot) and My Plague (Iowa) but it fell way short of being the \\"soft and sad\\" song.  Circle is completely Stonesour-ish.  (...).<br />This CD falls into an abyss, completely missed their potential.  I hope they stop now and let what was great just be.
B000092Q4U|5.0|In an age of formulaic and predictable bands passed as metal or hard rock by the major labels, Lamb of God sticks a defiant middle finger to the big record companies and records one of the finest metal records of the last 10 years.  Randy Blythe's vocals are a notable standout as he grabs you by the throat and refuses to let go.  Guitarists Willie Adler &amp; Mark Morton bring a sense of classic and new-school riffing and playing that will even impress the harshest of guitar critics.  Bassist John Campbell and drummer Chris Adler bring a tight rhythm section that sticks to you like super glue.  Every song delivers and even sticks with you.<br />This is metal the way it is done and should be done.  This is Lamb of God, Richmond's angry metal group.  Rock on.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I've seen the R2 version, and was blown away.  Sure, we're talking a 20 year old animation here, but the story and characters are marvellous.  We may not have state of the art CG dodads flying at us, but the quality, and the creators involved are first rate all the way.  <BR>     The R2 disc featured comments by Kazuyoshi Katayama, a production assistant, later responsible for \\"The Big O\\", \\"Appleseed\\", and \\"Argento-soma.\\"  It also features the legendary Hideaki Anno.  A Key Animator, who designed the Giant Robots for Miyazaki.  Anno is, of course, famous for directing \\"Nadia, Secret of Blue Water\\", \\"Wings of Honneamise\\" and his claim to fame, \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion.\\" <BR>     The music is by Joe Hisaishi, and it has touches that bring to mind things he does later in \\"Castle in the Sky\\", \\"Princess Mononoke\\" and \\"Spirited Away.\\" The music was done under tight budget constraints, so they seem to have used a lot of synthesizers.  But hey, it's the 80's, so it's understandable.  Overall, a must have DVD by one of the great artists of our time, with a veritable who's who of anime supporting him.  \\"Nausicaa\\" is a wonderful look at Hayao Miyazaki's genius, so obvious in this, his first original film. I would also suggest the Graphic Novels.  It took Miyazaki 12 years complete the tale he touches on in \\"Nausicaa\\".  His true masterpiece.

B000244FDW|5.0|This is my favorite version of P & P ever.  I really feel that it stays more true to the message of the book than any other.  So many versions forget that this isn't a love story, but a class story.  It's purpose was to illustrate the classism present in GB at this time.  The script varies only mildly from the book.  Elizabeth, Jane, and Mr. and Mrs. Bennett are all superb!  The note the movie ends on is just delicious.  I could be biased by having watched this version throughout my formative years, but I think it's a must-see.
0345451325|4.0|As the bloody Human-Covenant War rages on Halo, the fate of humankind may rest with one warrior, the lone SPARTAN survivor of another legendary battle . . . the desperate, take-no-prisoners struggle that led humanity to Halo--the fall of the planet Reach. Now, brought to life for the first time, here is the full story of that glorious, doomed conflict.<br />While the brutal Covenant juggernaut sweeps inexorably through space, intent on wiping out humankind, only one stronghold remains--the planet Reach. Practically on Earth's doorstep, it is the last military fortress to defy the onslaught. But the personnel here have another, higher priority: to prevent the Covenant from discovering the location of Earth.<br />Outnumbered and outgunned, the soldiers seem to have little chance against the Covenant, but Reach holds a closely guarded secret. It is the training ground for the very first &quot;super soldiers.&quot; Code-named SPARTANs, these highly advanced warriors, specially bioengineered and technologically augmented, are the best in the universe--quiet, professional, and deadly.<br />Now, as the ferocious Covenant attack begins, a handful of SPARTANs stand ready to wage ultimate war. They will kill, they will be destroyed, but they will never surrender. And at least one of them--the SPARTAN known as Master Chief--will live to fight another day on a mysterious and ancient, artificial world called Halo. . . .
B00003CXCT|1.0|After all these years of waiting and anticipation for what was said to be the greatest DVD release of all time , looks like its going to be the biggest disapointment of all time. Judging by what the features says, it looks as if there only releasing one of the greatest trilogys of all time in the newer so called \\"remastered\\" editions. George Lucas promised this wait was going to be worthwhile, and yet he has completly ignored the fans that have kept him in his status of where he is today, and decided not to actualy make a great DVD release. <br />Instead, he has chosen to release not only just the newer versions, he is releasing them in both widescreen and full screen. my pet peeve is not only with that, but would it be so hard to have BOTH wide screen and full screen on the one disc? especially seeing as how theres only going to be audio extras on the discs anyway. But no, Lucas Films wouldnt want to give back to the fans somthing worth while now would they?<br />My second pet peeve is one that I have read so many have agreed with me on, and thats the ORIGINAL presentation of the films. For years they have said that this DVD release would be the best release ever. Well, looks like there not going to live up to that expectation, why couldnt they include BOTH formats of the movies? why cant they have an option on them? that says \\"veiw original presentation? or veiw special edition?\\". that would make every body happy, wouldnt you think? OR even flip side discs? One side could have the original, and one side have the newer so called \\"improved\\" digitly remastered movies.... wouldnt that sound more like somthing to look foraward to?<br />Instead, Lucas has completly lost it with this, the bonus features arnt looking like anything worth looking forward to.... it's possible, but i doubht he would include things like when a few of the cast members where on \\"The muppet show\\" or various other TV appearences. Heck, the bonus disc should be a flip side too, and come with \\"the battle of Endore\\" and \\"Caravan of courage\\". the two forgotten and hardly known Ewok movies he made after ROTJ. They would both fit on one disc, and should be included as a bonus too.<br />Now, wouldnt all these years of wait seem more worthwhile if it came with BOTH editions of each film, the original, and special? both presentations of WIDE and FULL screen? and maybe throw in those two Ewok movies aswell? wouldnt that seem more worth the wait? Instead, Lucas is going to release a disapointing trilogy.... but if you want my advice, wait... dont buy this trilogy.... rent it, and dont make Lucas richer off this box set. because you will be kicking yourself in a couple of years time when Star Wars 3 comes out, and George goes for the \\"12 disc box set\\" and you think to yourself \\"damn, i shouldnt have bought the trilogy i have, i should have bought the new one, with all those extras\\" and you'll feel Lucas has ripped you off as it's looking right now... because most likly, he will release the original trilogy, and make money off that too, then find other ways to make money, there will be single editions,special editions,  ultimate editions, mega editions, and probably 2 to choose from in wide or full screens.... This over due and long wait for these so called \\"greatest DVD release\\" that has been told about, is going to be the greatest rip-off of all time. So many fan's will shut down there lightsabre's, take off there helmets, and walk away feeling like there god has just turned there back on them to make the most money out of them he can. Wookies will be howling at the moon over this. <br />Lucas wouldnt be around, least not int he way he is known today, if it wernt for the fans of Star Wars. And he has completly disapointed all of his fans with this abomination release of one of the greatest trilogys of all time. would both editions, and both widescreen and full screen be asking so much to put onto the one disc for each film? or flip side them? would it really be so hardto give back somthing really special to the fans that made him what he is today? would it really be asking for too much for George to be loyal to the fans, instead of trying to drain them for every cent they have?<br />That's my opinion. There are going to be thousands of disapointed Star War's fans out there when this comes out. If you want my advice? Dont buy it. Rent it, copy it, do whatever, just dont give Lucas any satsfaction of sitting back and seeing the $ sign's rise as he makes money off of somthing that hasnt been treated right... with DVD technoligy, George has ignored the possibilitys, he seems to be too wrapped up in what technology has to offer in rueining classic movies!<br />May the shwartz be with you.
0780020693|5.0|This collections of vignettes around his early youth, still remain as an outstanding triumph in the italian cinema.<br />The Fellini's style still influences in this age. Watch Ettore Scola (C'erovamo tanto amati) ,Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso and 1900)and Kusturica (Underground).<br />The irreverent moods created by this only surrealistic ambassador italian are a song to the freedom , a true 'ode to the joy' and a monumental rendition to the fertile imagination.<br />Amarcord in my view, is the peak of Fellini as dream maker, as story teller and above all as natural and organical sense of humor, in all of its possible and imaginable frequencies, since the virginal, poignant, irreverent, bitter and austere till the most no mercy satire.<br />Watch this unsurpassed film in its genre.<br />One of the glorious achievements not only of the cinema, but the art widely speaking.

B0001WTVUW|2.0|I vividly recall watching (and taping) this when it played in the early 80's. While it displays many of the trappings of  &quot;made for TV&quot;  movies, it packs quite a punch. There are moments in the film that still give me chills 20 years later. Unfortunately one of those moments has been destroyed on this DVD. When a fellow doctor asks the Jason Robards character what he saw, he replies: &quot;...it was high in the air. Like the sun exploding...TWO suns.&quot; His colleague appears crushed by the revelation. It's an emotional moment. On the DVD it appears to be just before the layer change. Robards gets half the sentence out when there is a pause in the picture, then another scene. For all I know there may be more missing. This may not be an all-time classic film but it deserves better than this. <BR>The nice looking transfer doesn't make up for this shabby treatment.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|Yes, yes, yes! Marvelous period detail, accurate to the nth degree of infinite boredom. Weir does SUCH a fine job of fitting in so much unnecessary (but, gee, it's so realistic!) detail that he forgot to add a plot. The flimsy storyline about one tiny ship chasing a bigger one really begins to wear thin once one realizes we're dealing with \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey. No Nelson he, not even a Hornblower. His guile strikes the viewer as labored and obvious -- not that Crowe does not do a good job at acting the part. He presents Aubrey in all his luck, his vulgarity, and rather simplemindedness. But after picking out all the fine details and admiring them, I was still left waiting for a grand denouement that never happened with a hero who's less than inspiring. The minor characters are just that, and the subplots are vapid and make the movie longer than it needs to be. This is not the naval action movie that is going to make a believer out of me. And one more thing - nice music but it didn't match the action. That was very jarring in some places.
0425074811|4.0|I am an avid reader into the paranormal and I recently read Chariots of the Gods? by Erich Von Daniken. I am absolutely taken back by the theories that are presented by Mr. Daniken. Chariots of the Gods left me questioning the validity of our ancient past on earth.<br />Did space travelers really land on Earth in the past? Were the chariots spoken of in the Bible really space crafts? Are the Nazca lines really a landing port for visitors from outer space? There are just so many questions that need answering. Erich Von Daniken is on the right track with his book. Maybe we all need to start a new movement to search for the REAL answers that humanity needs to know. Thank you Mr. Daniken for the wonderful book.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Blues purtists will always have their opinions (or why be one?), but as someone new to the blues, this CD is a revelation. It inspired me to buy the Robert Johnson CD set. I played Johnson's performance next to each Clapton version and was struck by how true Clapton is to the spirit of Johnson's performaces. Me and Mr Johnson is one of the finest artistic achievements of Eric Clapton's extraordinary career. While his guitar virtuosity is as always present in every song, it is his superb vocals that resonate long after the music ends. This must be added to the essential recordings of Eric Clapton. I now understand why so many artists say they play the blues when they just want to feel good. This is a joyous performance that celebrates Johnson's genius and just makes me feel good!

0345420128|5.0|This book is unreal.  I could not put it down.  I have read many, many books on the subject, and this is the only text that covers the subject in a scientific, rather than SUPERNATURAL way.  it's SCIENCE, people!  and it's absolutely fascinating.  it will change your life.  i'm sure you hear that every day, and you can choose to read this review and dicard it, but either way, it's unreal.  It will change the way you see your waking life as well as your dream life.  NOT just on a short-term basis, as so many self-help books, but in a meaningful, realistic, down-to-earth approach that dates back to Buddhist monks seeking Enlightenment (if you are a hard-core Christian, please don't be alarmed at this point... many of their theories are applicable to you, as well).  Anyway, it is a life-changing book.  You will begin to see how many people \\"sleep-walk\\" through their waking life and \\"wake-walk\\" through their sleeping life.  I have had 3 lucid dreams since reading this book 3 months ago, and each is more enjoyable than the one before.  the last one i had was by far the most exhilirating experience of my life.  as good as sex (i won't go as far as to say \\"better than sex\\").  it's unreal.  just buy it... i SWEAR to you it will be worth every penny.
0767817664|5.0|Anyone settling in for the night with some snacks and a couple of friends would not fail to enjoy this movie.  It is a gruesome, slightly campy horror romp that hardly gets anything wrong.  It's a great deal of fun.<BR>Charlie is a normal teen; all he wants out of life is to get some nooky from his girlfriend and maybe pass his trigonometry test, too.  But Charlie has a new neighbor who likes to drain the blood out of prostitutes, and he can't just sit by without doing something about it.  Yes, he discovers the guy next door is a vampire, and of course no one believes him.<BR>The cast is perfect.  The wonderful, underrated Chris Sarandon plays the dapper vampire, whose name (Jerry!) isn't all that scary, but he still manages to serve up plenty of menace.  Charlie is capably played by William Ragsdale.  Reluctantly assisting Charlie in his crusade are Amanda Bierce (&quot;Married...with Children&quot;) as his whiny girlfriend, Stephen Geoffreys as his goofball buddy Ed, and Roddy McDowell as a has-been TV horror flick host who talks the talk but is too cowardly to walk the walk.  Geoffreys in particular is priceless.  He is easily the most entertaining character in the movie, especially after he encounters Jerry in an alley late one night (in a haunting, surprisingly sympathetic scene).  When the &quot;vampire hunters&quot; finally make their stand at Jerry's house, all hell breaks loose.<BR>Gore galore, laughs and scares... All I can say is, have fun!
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions in a sense breaks away from the philosophical mish mesh laid out in the first two parts. For any one studies or knows any philosophy the Matrix trilogy is by far groundbreaking and accurate when it comes to the philosophical attributes of what is reality, shaping human destiny, irrealism and even things that appears to be  Kafka-esque. Yet the probelm with philosophy or even in the last two series of the Matrix the deal with worlds and sense of perfection lies in someone's else's head or world and that to project on anybody else is extremely dangerous and stupid. <br />In my opinion, the Third series kinds of mature away from the hubristic philosophical presumptions of reality and irreality(even though I must admit is pretty interesting and what makes the Matrix trilogy great movies) and focus on attention on how the future really is going to be. <br />It is the war scenes that really caught my attention between the humans of Zions and the machines battling it out. It is amazing afterall that in the future wars aren't going to be fought with huge fleets of ships or hundreds of thousands of soldiers rushing onto a target but rather more like with  high tech knights and advance technology that can do a lot more damage. No wonder you are starting to see previews here and there for the sequel to Star Ship Troopers 2. <br />I hope they come out with another part. Because no one cannot take seriously a point of a movie that when the machines finally left that peace will last forever. There are for sure thousands of Mr. Smith or Agent Smith ready to come onto the scenes but the question remains under what guise.<br />One of the things I like about the Matrix Series,especially this last part, it doesn't neglect the energies that shapes history and fuel war. After all, Neo becomes the chosen one. Even when his eyes are gorged out or Trinity gets killed, he still succeeds not only as a 'strong warrior' but also as a diplomat. Of course what the next Matrix needs to do is  to look at the element of time. As generation lapses, on the one hand, lots tend to be forgotten that we in present cherish or for that matter take for granted and ,on the other hand, even if later generations compare to before choose to connect themselves to the past, the creeds, mores, and the sources is just isn't there anymore.
B000001GOZ|5.0|I've listened to all the usual suspects in those competing for &quot;Best Mahler 6th&quot; and this one is the one that I prefer after repeated listenings.  I love Karajan's reading of the opening movement, it is big and powerful (probably a bit more than Boulez's) and you can't argue with saying that Bernstein's is certainly among the finest either.<br /><br />Boulez does an excellent job here, it is meticulous reading as others have said.  At times in the first movement, I wish the brass was a bit stronger, but that is really just a minor grumble.  One of the other things that makes me come back to this one  more often is the fact that it is on a single disc.  I can listen to it all the way through without having to change CDs or have a huge gap in between movements waiting for the CD changer to kick in.  When three recordings are as neck and neck as Bernstein, Boulez and Karajan, the single disc (for price &amp; convenience) pushed it over the top for me.<br /><br />I'm sure a lot of people will grumble, moan and roll their eyes at this, but let's be honest,  how many people besides those with music degrees or listening to the recording with a copy of the score in their lap are going to miss a few seconds here and there?  I'd rather here it tightened  up and put it all on one disc.
B00005U2JL|4.0|everything about this DVD is great, i've been a Manson fan since my parents said i couldn't listen to it back in 1997. The one thing this DVD has that was not needed, was the switching through shows, it's play one song and you see it from 4 countries. One show he has a big hat, flash to the crowd, then hes just got pants and a lot of face pant. At one point in Sweet Dreams he has this woman on stage about to get naked, then BOOM, it goes to some other show where it's just him rolling around on the stage. So if you don't mind the constant changing, then you have nothing to worry about. But me, i like to see one show and all the crazy stuff Manson will do on stage.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|This album is really mediocre.  A lot of the lyrics, vocals, and composition are laughable.  &quot;Let Go&quot; was MUCH better, you're better off buying that.  The loss of the Matrix producers is definitely apparent on this album.  Lots of bad songs and just a big disappointment overall.
1400034779|5.0|I probably wouldn't have read this except that my mother threw this one my way, plus most of my family's read at least this one of the series by Alexander McCall Smith.<br />Mma Ramotswe's detective agency, the only one in the entire country of Botswana in southern Africa, is, (by American standards), short-staffed and sparsely equipped; she's the only detective, her only equipment a phone, her white van, and a typewriter.  She has one employee.  She purchased her one room office building with inheritance money she received from her father who had been a small-scale cattle rancher.<br />My favorite case which she solves is a scam, commonplace in Botswana, where an elderly man shacks up with a young female pretending to be her long lost father and whose sole objective is to drain her of her time, energy, and finances so long as he abides there.<br />How she obtains her first confession was my first lol, laughing out loud, incident while reading this book.
B000002BSG|3.0|For us Jamiroquai fans who love the instrumental and creative side to the band, Travelling Without Moving is the album that begins a total descent into 'jazz-pop', that Jamiroquai, by the two latest albums have turned into. The album does deserve 3 stars due to its' obvious merits in terms of accessability. Virtual Insanity is the best song on the album, and one expects the album to develop depth and innovation wise, but it simply never occurs. One of the main reasons seems to be in the bands increased use of strings and guitars, rather than a greater range of horns and synths, which makes Jamiroquai's music less challenging and gives it an easy cuddly feel. <BR>Overall the album is a collection of catchy songs, but with little experimentation, sadly unlike Space Cowboy and Emergency.
B000002J09|4.0|Don't get me wrong this album is a classic and deserves all of the recognition it gets. The only reason that I gave it a 4 out of five is that it is prone to overexposure.  There are so many great Zeppelin albums out there.  I sometimes get tired of hearing all of the songs from 4.  I guess you can blame the radio for that.

An occasional bolt of lighting in the far distance flashes. The setting sun sets the horizon on fire. The sea is swept into low chop by wind, but is otherwise calm. It's cold, but the wind is in your sails as you speed along the water. You are filled with a strange sort of hope.<br />That is Sigur Ros.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|now i usually hate the bands of today which is called nu-metal. though these guys are not a poser band though it has some bits of nu-metal...and theres also thrash metal!!!!!thrash metal is my fav,and these guys has really super heavy sound even with some bits of nu-metal its still awesome!!!!. theres lots of great riffs...insane drumming....screaming loud vocals...which makes this new slipknot album a masterpiece!!!!. so if you like the 80's thrash movement stuff you might like this stuff...or just shut up and buy it!!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the Zone is for sure one of the best albums I've bought.  Give Britney a chance and listen to the album, it's much better than her previous work.  I like every song and I can listen to certain ones loads of times and not get sick of them.  I especially love Everytime, Breathe On Me, Toxic, &amp; Touch of My Hand.  If you want a really great pop album, pick this one up ASAP!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I cannot stand it when people get on here and talk about what crap Josh's voice is. Have you actually listened to the cd?  And saying that he puts no FEELING into his music? PLEASE! I've never heard so much passion or feeling in an artist before, and I listen to all SORTS of music.  Oh, and about him not really being able to sing....well, when I attended his concert he did a little piece somewhat acapella and his voice lost no power or emotion.  Josh is simply amazing - no questions asked.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is a surprizingly brilliant film with great original music that will get stuck in your head and have you glad you bought it so you can sing along.  The depth of the characters is amazing considering the subject matter, and the actors themselves are very underrated, they're all superb! Mitchell is able to make a loveable, enchanting, and yet meaningful piece that is extraordinarily funny as well.  A+++++++++++!
B00000J2PH|5.0|When I first heard about Tapestry and Carole King,for that matter(2 years ago,I'm only 14!) on some Vh1 &quot;Greatest Albums&quot; countdown,I wanted to buy right when I finished hearing about it.As a matter of fact,Carole and Tapestry is the reason I listen to classic rock so much!But Tapestry is much more than some classic rock album.It's a fusion of soul,realism,earthiness,and beatiful lyrics written by an amazing singer/songwriter.The best white soul tracks on this classic are:Carole's 1971 version of &quot;You Make Me Feel(Like A Natural Woman)&quot;,the down-to-earth &quot;I Feel The Earth Move&quot;,and the cool &quot;It's Too Late&quot;.And while The Shirelles' version of &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?&quot; is a great classic yet a little childish,Carole makes it more mature and makes it age a little better,too.And if you're a college student,this album is for you,especially track number 4,&quot;Home Again&quot;!But the best song here by far is the beautiful &quot;So Far Away&quot;,where Carole shows so much vulnerability and so much genuity that this song is definitely a landmark album,and it is my personal favorite,too!And Carole's vocals are amazing on this album,and she may not be screaming,but she still can hold her own.And there is no imbalance in this CD,it;s the perfect ratio of rock on and cry your heart out,as weird as that sounds!<br />The Verdict:This Amazing Classic Deserved To Sell This Much And,At Least I Think,Deserved To Sell Even More!Thank You Carole!<br />Recommended:Yes

B00008D1NF|5.0|these artists play well together as attested to in the dvd of their process.  the music here is playful, inventive nouveau tropicalia for the 21st century.  lets hope they do this at least once more.  you wont be dissapointed.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I saw this film not knowing anything about it, and that element of surprize helped entirely because if you're looking for a film that's about gritty hardcore s+m, this isn't it.  But if you're looking for one with heart, humor, and beautiful-strangeness, then this is a wonderful movie to see.  I loved the ending, it is beautiful and unforgettably visual.  It's my favourite James Spader film to date, I think it fits him perfectly.  And Maggie Gyllenhaal shows she is a talented, brave actress who's not afraid of taking an unusual role.  The camera work is beautiful, suspenseful, dramatic, sensual... oh i can't say enough good things about this film, there is not another like it!
0385720920|4.0|It was an enjoyable experience - CHOKE - however, I would not say it demonstrates a Swiftian satire as stated on the back cover of the novel.  Johnathan Swift was a brilliant satirist, Palahniuk is above average.<br />CHOKE is enjoyable to read and it makes you think about our present state as humans.  He does a good job in leaving the questions that are brough up throughout the novel unanswered.  He demands us as the reader, not only Palahniuk but Victor as well, to formulate our own ideas about what we should do in this world of ours.
B00004SCX6|2.0|When I got this CD I thought it was going to be my favorite CD of all time. Guess I thought wrong. This CD made me cry because I spend $11.99 on a crappy CD.<br />People, don't get this. Please.
B000083E79|5.0|I am kind of surprised by all the negative reviews from people claiming that Cher is a no-talent who was famous only because of her husband, Sonny Bono.  I find that claim interesting, considering that Sonny was only involved in the first 10 years of Cher's career.  Was Sonny also responsible for the following 30 years of success Cher had--even though he had nothing to do with her?  And, if Sonny was such a genius, why was he never able to regain the kind of success he had when he was with Cher?  <br />People will trash and bash Cher from now until eternity.  I suppose they are trying to convince themselves.  Anyway, people can say what they want, but Cher's legendary success speaks for itself--she is the ultimate diva.  She has done it all.  No one else can touch her, though they may try.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When I heard Slipknot was coming out with a new album, I was entirely floored, being a fan since Wait and Bleed first appeared on MTV After Hours.<br />Some fans on this board complain that Slipknot's sound is now very \\"Stone Sourish\\" and more commercial, asserting that basically they have \\"sold out\\". Well the bits about their sound changing are partially true (varies from track to track), and the lack of cursing certainly supports this idea of trying to increase commercial appeal. <br />This is a great CD, but at first I was really put off because I expected an Iowa Part 2 or a Self-Titled revisited. The band is softer in a lot of ways, but the songs are really catchy and some of them still rock like hell. I wish more songs on here were like \\"The Blister Exists\\" and \\"Opium of the People\\" because that closely resembles the path I wish the band had taken with the full album. About the acoustic songs: \\"Circle\\" is a good song, but it just won't grow on me. \\"Vermillion Pt. 2\\" is also pretty good, but I don't *love* it. \\"Danger - Keep Away\\", however, reminds me of System of a Down's \\"Roulette\\" from \\"Steal This Album!\\" in that it is an addictive song with an incredibly catchy chorus to it. \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\" is Slipknot's tribute to their fans and it seemed patronizing to me at first; I thought, God this is just a lame re-hash of Iowa stuff(particularly the corny-brilliance of \\"Heretic Anthem\\"), almost like the band is saying \\"Here: this is to appease the fans who want more of old Slipknot\\", but after a few listens, I'm hooked on it. Right now, my favorite songs are \\"Before I Forget\\" and \\"The Nameless\\", both of which I am positively addicted to. Of course, \\"Duality\\" is fantastic.<br />In terms of musicality, there are some truly brutal and interesting guitar leads to be heard. Joey's drumming is, of course, astounding and proves that he is one of the metal greats. I never pay much attention to lyrics, but Slipknot, for various reasons, makes me curious about the lyrics. In the past, the lyrics always seemed especially \\"charged\\" - without the music, they still carried the emotion of the piece. But alot of these new songs seem very weak in terms of lyrical content. Maybe if Corey would let loose an occasional f**k, things would be better; in general, I just expect a little more from the guy who penned the line \\"You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes.\\" <br />My main message is this: songs like \\"Wait and Bleed\\" and (sic) are some of the greatest songs in metal history, and living up to that, re-capturing that, going back to that point in your life and finding that unrestrained anger when your current life is so different, is probably impossible for the groupmates. A line like \\"I wanna slit your throat and f**k the wound\\" in \\"Disasterpiece\\" is some of the most powerful stuff a metal band has ever done, and that's what I desperately wanted more of, but it seems the band, for personal and commercial reasons can't do this anymore. Am I disappointed at this? Yes. But disappointed with this album seperate of that desire? Hell No! At least they released an album! Let's face it: Slipknot has been unofficially broken up for some time, and no one really expected them to re-unite other than to tour.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|HAHAHAHA yeah the cd is a change but they're breaking there limts form the same old stuff they always played. it is a change from one slipknot song sounding like the rest on there cd's... You want  &quot;Aggression and Intensity &quot; then put in an older cd simple as that.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Is defined in the film &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;.  Based upon the bestselling book of the same title by Laura Hillenbrand, this film distills the story of the unlikely Seabiscuit down to its essence and while like most films based on books it glosses over/leaves out certain elements, it is a triumph unto itself.  Well acted *I admit frankly it changed my opinion of Tobey Maguire...who was one of the executive producers as well!!*, well scripted, beautifully filmed and with a sublime score from Randy Newman, Seabiscuit delivers on all levels.  It is a refreshing reminder of the power and grace of the American cinema, of what Hollywood can do if it chooses to and that film is a form of art to be reckoned with.
B00005QGAX|5.0|After I bought Michael's impressive &quot;Thriller&quot; album, I purchased Bad.  I was shocked because this album was so much different than Thriller. The songs in Bad seemed to have more rock in it.  However, I liked this album just as much.  My favorites on this cd are:<br />Bad - This song was a great choice for the introduction. It's probably one of my top 5 favorites.<br />The Way You Make Me Feel - This song is perfect in every way. It's definitely my favorite one of all.  This is one of the songs that will stick in your head all day.  Not a bad thing, though.<br />Just Good Friends - Michael and Stevie were both amazing in this song.  It's also in my top 5.<br />Man In The Mirror - This song is one that I could see being in the Thriller album. Michael sounds great, and the rhythm is great, too. It's the second best of the album in my opinion. <br />Dirty Diana - Dirty Diana is one that is impossible not to sing along to.   <br />Smooth Criminal - This is a good dancing song.  If you haven't seen the music video yet, you should definitely check it out. It's one of my Michael's personal favorites. It's one of mine, also.<br />The two other songs I really liked on this album are Streetwalker and Fly Away.  AND THEY WERE BOTH CUT!! <BR>                      *GROWL* <BR>I was shocked when I found out that Quincy thought that Another Part Of Me would be a better choice for the album than Streetwalker.  I don't know what he was thinking.  Another Part Of Me was by far my least favorite song in the album mainly because the lyrics are so short, but the song drags on for four minutes.  The chorus is repeated a million times.  Streetwalker is 1,000 times better. I love Streetwalker because it's base is amazing.  If more work was done on it, and put on the album, I think it would have been a hit. Fly away could have been, too if the song was edited a little. The lyrics were pretty good, and it was again way better than another part of me. I'm very glad I got the specialedition version or I wouldn't have had TWO of my favorite songs on the album.  <BR>Okay.... now that I got that out of my system... lol<BR>I hope this review helped you in making your decision whether or not to purchase this album.<BR>*Megan*
B0001UL7RY|5.0|i highly recommend this CD to anyone who liked her first one...personally i think it's miles better than Let Go, because I can relate to it more.. this cd is awesome.  The songs are deeper and not so focused on relationships..The last song Slipped Away, for example is dedicated to her grandfather.  The guitar is harder, but some of her vocals could be nastier. All in all, this was a very well written album and props to Avril. I don't think she'll be leaving the music scene anytime soon...
B00006J3WH|4.0|The Buffy soundtrack for this episode, though amusing, does not due the actual sequence of the show justice. It is amusing though, if you know the show. I must commend Amber Benson on a rather great job, as well as Anthony Stewart Head. I really wasn't impressed with the rest of the cast, but I believe that was their point. All in all, it was rather worth the money. It is just upsetting that Buffy is over and their isn't a chance for the return of Sweet and for their to be another musical episode...and Angel is over, no hope for that either. Oh well, all Buffy fans, enjoy your CD's!
B00004R99J|1.0|Pocahontas is, in my opinion, quite possibly the worst offering ever from Disney studios *and yes, I am including the forgettable offerings of the '80's in this rating*.  Highly stylized animation, a soundtrack with only one worthwhile song *Colors of the Wind* and I would say a bad plot but there really wasn't one there, all contribute to this.  Even the voices of David Ogden Stiers *and he had 2 roles!* and Mel Gibson couldn't save this one.  Children might like the animal sidekicks, but that is about all that will engage their interest.

0790733226|2.0|This movie could have been better if it simply had aspired to be a science fiction movie only. Instead we are treated to a bad script, an annoying love affair, and an overly sophomoric and contrived ending. Loved the concept and special effects, but ended up feeling embarrassed for the actors and their performances.
6304240554|5.0|For all you people who thinks this movie is cheesy or sucks you obviously have no taste. you probably think garbage like \\"I know what you did last summer\\" deserves an academy award! <BR>This is hands down one of the best zombie films ever. i have seen it several times and never get tired of it. When the world is being overrun by zombies 4 people hide out in a shopping mall, and horror ensues. Recommended highly! everyone did a good job on this from the acting to the direction to the music. i have not seen the remake yet and i am sure it will not be as good as this!<BR>P.S. This is not my favorite horror movie but I think it is alot better then most being made today.
B00004XPPB|5.0|How many actors say their prayers for a role like this?  DONNIE BRASCO is Johnny Depp's bright light moment...when you upstage Pacino, in yet another of his own moments of greatness, you tend to wonder what's next.  This is where Depp shed his \\"youth star\\" label and became an actor.  The real crime here is that Depp and Pacino were hijacked at Oscar time (the film was released early in 1997).  Mike Newell's direction again makes the point that Eurpoean's have a fresh view of American film and it's most stalwart genres.  DONNIE BRASCO could serve as an FBI training film  and why protocol should dictate that married men are forbidden to undertake deep cover assignments.  The only flaw I caught was the reference to John Wayne's death:  The Duke died June, 1979 and the film shows 6 inches of snow in New Jersey.  Fatal, forget-about-it!
B0000C1733|5.0|This is a pretty good album, but it doesn't have each and every graetest hit. Most of these others are found on What Hits!? I think the best bet would be to buy The Greatest AND What Hits!?
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|After last year's very promising &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; EP, Franz Ferdinand now hits the big time with the release of their debut album. The band's sound invites comparisons to the Strokes and Interpol, but comes away very nicely with its own sound.<br />&quot;Franz Ferdinand&quot; (11 tracks, 38 min.) starts off very misleadingly, albeit beautifully, with a very soft 45 sec. intro to &quot;Jacqueline&quot;, with just guitar and vocals, only to then explode into the full band sound, setting the stage for the entire album. Lead-singer Alex Kapranos is very confident, without sneering. Stand-out tracks include the Hot Hot Heat-ish &quot;Tell Her Tonite&quot; (which appeared in demo-version on the &quot;Darts&quot; EP), and &quot;Take me Out&quot; (2nd single), which is the best song here, period, and rocks irresistably. Others include &quot;The Dark of the Matinee&quot; (3rd single), &quot;Come on Home&quot; (with even some synths up front), and &quot;Michael&quot; (set for release in July as the 4th single in the UK). In reality, there really are only a couple of less-than-stellar songs, such as &quot;This Fire&quot;.<br />Franz Ferdinand has ascended very quickly to the musical top in the UK in the past year, not unlike the Darkess, but are in my opinion far the better of the Darkness. I can't wait to see these guys live at some point. Meanwhile, this album is not leaving my CD changer any time soon!<br />PS IF you were wondering about the band's name, FF was the Austrian duke whose murder was the immediate cause of the beginning of WWI...
0380789019|5.0|Neil Gaiman has discovered a hook, line, and sinker theory with Neverwhere. The thought of &quot;Where do forgotten things go?&quot;, answered in detail with the theory that they go to a bits-and-pieces city underground, is so captivating, that even if this novel was undescriptive and boring (which it isn't), it would keep you reading even if it was 700 pages long, just to find out more about the concept of a city that is entirely unknown to us, that exists right beneath us, and consists of all the riffraff and the people who have, as Gaiman so cleverly states it, &quot;fallen through the cracks&quot;. The character quirks that Gaiman manages to think of are so ludicrous, and, indeniably, real, that it gives the characters a whole new dimension. Gaiman invents characters that often seem to be just for the humor at first, and manages to shape them into vital parts of the story, that either teach a valuable lesson to the protagonist and hero, Richard Mayhew, or provide a much needed &quot;favor&quot; (a special currency of London Below). This book is, no-questions-asked, a winner.                                                                         Your Lord and Master,<BR>                         Wade Redfearn
B0001DI0FI|2.0|what a lopsided battle at the end. The master and commander himself, charging lead through a barrage of longbarreled shooters is able to stab and hack through all the Gauls with swords themselves -  and kill every one of them! no backstabs since the little kids are handling the others with their sidearms and scabbards. Yep the english boys cant miss!<BR>the final score is britain - 20 dead france 100000000 dead.  Well thats about all i noticed of the movie since the other two hours of it I was kinda zoned out due to noninterest.
B000002B7O|5.0|Diary of a Madman is a legendary album.  I could go into great deal about the amazing melodies throughout the album, or the beautifully poetic lyrics of Bob Daisley, but many of the other reviewers have covered it.<br />Be warned though, the item you are viewing is the only copy of Diary of a Madman you should buy.  The 2002 &quot;remaster&quot; is actually a rerecorded copy done to screw Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake out of royalties.  They edited them off of those copies and replaced them with the talented, yet inferior Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin.<br />Not only does that piss on two of the people that helped create that album, but it pisses on us, the fans, and most of all, the memory of Randy Rhoads who is now playing along side two people he has never met.<br />i still respect Ozzy as a musician for his amazing vocal melodies, but there is little else I can respect him for.  The three people most responsible for his initial greatness as a &quot;solo&quot; artist have either passed away or have been erased from his history thanks to the greed of he and his wife Sharon.<br />Buy the 95s remasters!  They sound great and they encompass the original legendary lineup.
0679731725|5.0|Kazuo Ishiguro's butler is a perfect example of, what Nietzsche called, people who employ the wrong conjugation: they don't live, they are lived.<BR>The main character in this book 'Stevens' has but one aim in his life: to become his master's perfect butler, his impeccable servant, the self-effacing loyal executioner of his master's desires. If his master plays the fascist's game, he will excuse him and protest that he is not an anti-Semite, but he will fire the Jewish household personnel without the slightest regret. If his master changes his ideas, no problem, he goes with him. That's what he calls 'dignity' or 'carrying out his duties to the best of his abilities'.<BR>That is also what Eichmann said or the brutal executioners in Pol Pot's death camp. Those are the words of today's cold career men.<BR>Stevens accepts unflinchingly his fatality:'that the likes of you and I will never be in a position to comprehend the great affairs of today's world, and our best course will always be to put our trust in an employer' (p.211) or 'The hard reality is that for the likes of you and me, there is little choice other than to leave our fate, ultimately, in the hands of those great gentlemen at the hub of this world who employ our service.' (p.257)<BR>A terrible negation of one's own life and responsibilities.<BR>Kazuo Ishiguro has written an implacable dark masterpiece.
0451169514|5.0|King is a genius &amp; a national treasure. His stories are timeless. I'll never feel the same walking past a sewage drain again! But they should quit trying to make movies out of his books. The films never do his novels justice. just my opinion.
B0001611DI|5.0|After finishing this movie, I was filled with mixed emotions.  I did not see the first or the third, but now that this has captured my attention I will inevitably see them both.  The plot gets you so into the lives of the  characters without actually telling the story of their lives, if that makes any sense.  It may just be me but i think that during the movie, i felt connected with them, trapped in that mall with them, it was a pretty cool experience.  Get this movie, you shouldn't need to read this to convince you, it just gives off an aura of excellence when you see it.  Not for everyone however; if you don't like violence, even if it is 70's effects, don't buy it, rent it and see it with a boyfriend or girlfriend.  A must see for anyone; it isn't the violence that makes it interesting, it is the great plot and text of the movie.

630522885X|5.0|Max Ophuls last movie, Lola Montes, is now on DVD, though it has no special features, no trailer, merely filmography and a list of awards as well as scene selections. In 1955, Max Ophuls had already directed several classic films of the French market during World War II days, 30's and 40's- his most honored being La Ronde. To many, Lola Montes was not the greatest film Max Ophuls ever made. He was a naturalized Frenchman, adored the culture but was Austrian born, specifically Vienna. His films were considered artsy, classy and dramatically appealing. Ophuls followed an ABA or &quot;Ronde&quot; circular plot structure. What happens in the beginning of a film will return at the end of the film. Never is this more true than in his famous La Ronde, set in Vienna about the many intrigues of love affairs. On DVD, the CinemaScope color of Lola Montes is in its beautiful restored glory, though it can look better in some parts. The movie is so old it truly shows its &quot;cinematic wrinkles&quot;. Martine Carol is the woman whose quiet beauty and restrained mannerisms landed her the title role, Peter Ustinov, who did several movies, including American films, plays the role of the ringmaster who is entertaining audiences at a circus by showing off Lola Montes and her incredible life story and Anton Walbrook, who appeared as Lentmontov in the English film, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; in the part of King Ludwig.<br />Lola Montes is a fictional and sensationalized account of the true, historic person of the courtesan/Spanish dancer Lola Montes, regarded as the most famous 19th century courtesan. She did exist, she had love affairs with what were celebrities at that time- Franz Liszt the pianist and composer and her most impressive lover, King Ludwig of Bavaria, the so-called &quot;Mad King&quot; whose extravagant lifestyle, erratic behavior and expensive castle building projects cost Bavaria a lot of money and made his own people turn against him. The circus element is entirely fabricated for the sake of drama. The ringmaster, Peter Ustinov, is entertaining audiences, mostly composed of men, with scenes of Lola Montes lives and in the end, she leaps from on high in an incredible stunt after which she must deign herself to be kissed by all the men for only one dollar. Peter Ustinov is speaking three languages if you really notice- French, German and the bits of English he speaks to Lola during the jumping scene. The use of English, which even Lola uses now and then, is meant to cater to the American or English audiences who must have seen this film. Martine Carol, in my opinion, does a terrific job as Lola Montes. She is a polyamorous woman, who is clearly liberated, passionate and earthy. She has dignity despite everything. The only thing I had against her performance is they never showed her dancing the Spanish dances she was so famous for- the bolero, the fandango, tarantella, etc. They could have cast an actual Spanish dancer in the role.
0688170528|4.0|This was a good book. However, I felt a little bit dissapointed that the plot was very similar to Keeping Faith, a book I had read before this one. It also seems very similar to other books by Picoult that I have read the back cover on. I don't know why, but it just made is seem a bit... can't think of a word to describe it! But it dissapointed me.<br />Don't get me wrong, this was a great book! It really questioned some things to do with love, death, and expectations of people. It also really made me feel for Emily. I felt so sad that he life went down the drain from a single incident, and I was just screaming at her &quot;tell someone! Let it out!!&quot; I don't know why, but i felt like if she had just done that, her life would have been a whole lot better... she would have had alot more confidence anyway. That was the main thing about this book that really got me
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This album rocks with Avril's voice soaring out ever higher with passion.  While it might not out do her first album, it's certainly just as good and now I love her even more.  Under my Skin seems to be a little more personal and mature.  She definitly put alot of heart into this one and it is a must have for any avril fan.  I bought it the day it came out.  If you havn't gotten it yet, I suggest you do!
031286504X|5.0|This book, which is sadly short, is easily the second greatest vampire story written, behind Dracula of course.<br />Once i started reading I Am Legend i just could not put it down and finished it in one long sitting. It starts off superb and doesnt let up one bit. The ending also is beautiful, smart, and tragic. Truly original.<br />And what many people arent mentioning is that I Am Legend only takes up half of this book. The second half is a compilation of Matheson's short stories and are extremely entertaining also.<br />Buy this book. Now!
0380789035|4.0|Don't be thrown off by the random F-word in the first page of the book. (This, to me, is usually a signifier of poor writing, a way to spice up dry writing.) This book is a book that may or may not be worth your time. Many of the other reviews for this book merely talked about the plot and how one dimensional it was, but they were missing the whole point. Neil Geiman was really trying to say something about society with this allegory/satire of America. What exactly? i'm still not quite sure, but it was an interesting read.<br />Another warning; don't be turned off by the fact that the lead character is an X-convict. This very idea sort of made me reluctant to read it at first, I don't know why, I just thought maybe it would be a character you wouldn't be able to relate to at all. But the lead character is actually very interesting, in my opinion. Most of the story takes place as an AMerican road odyssey, and might not be what you think. This is not a fantastic, sexy, dark imagination fest like a Clive Barker book, or a historical plot with some magic thrown in like a Tim Powers book, this book is in itself what it is, and can't really be compared with writings of other authors. This book reminded me more of the type of thing they make you read in high school, with definate literary elements, obvious or not, and few characters that are easy to get to know.<br />While I liked the book and the sort of simple feel that Shadow created on his Journey of the situation, I found some points of the story to be dissapointing, however. First off, i hated Sam, (girl Sam). And I didn't understand what was going on between her and Shadow. She was such a creepy lesbian, but Shadow who you come to know and respect as a man of moral character in the book, has a thing for her or something. Second off, I didn't understand or see any purpose in all those little interludes between chapters that Geiman put it. He puts in these parts of the book where they explain what Gods are doing in America, or how they got there long ago, but then that's it. Characters are intruduced for one chapter that you never hear from again! For example, there is one chapter where the author takes you to New York where a Arab man is trying to get an interview. When he doesn't get the interview, he meets this cab-driver who happens to be a god. They have sex, and then the chapter is over. You never hear of either of these guys again! It just doesn't add up to anything at all. Not only that, but the ending had me, like another review stated, scratching my head. What happened to the war between the gods? Did i miss something? One minute, they were preparing for battle then they go back to Shadow discovering these secrets at one of the small towns he was at. Not only that, but whatever happened to his dead wife?<br />All in all, this was an interesting read. Given the downers of the book, this is probably a book you would want to read if you finish books fairly quickly. If you are the type of person that must really commit to a book and spend time on it, i wouldn't recommend this. And another thing, (...). There's bairly any sexual content in this book, just the forementioned scene i described and maybe one other brief one. Other than that, it's pretty non-sexual.ca, or how they got there long ago, but then that's it. Characters are intruduced for one chapter that you never hear from again! For example, there is one chapter where the author takes you to New York where a Arab man is trying to get an interview.

Given the downers of the book, this is probably a book you would want to read if you finish books fairly quickly. If you are the type of person that must really commit to a book and spend time on it, i wouldn't recommend this. And another thing, (...). There's bairly any sexual content in this book, just the forementioned scene i described and maybe one other brief one. Other than that, it's pretty non-sexual.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|This movie has its strengths and weaknesses. My opinion of it has declined since I saw it, and I do think it's the weakest of the trilogy, but it's definitley still worth seeing.<br />Pros - Some really excellent scenes, from the murky fight in the club to the more intense battle inside the craft between Neo and Smith, and of course the final battle, which may be a bit overwrought but is still visually impressive. Also I don't think Reeves' performance is as bad as some people say; it wouldn't make sense for him to express emotion strongly when the plot of the series has gradually been turning him into a superhuman, detached, Christ-like figure; I think a lot of his blankness may be intentional.<br />Cons - There is a lot of bad acting, admittedly, and a lot of moments which are embarassing in their sentimentality or simply their lack of sense. The movie's worst flaw, though, is its inabilty to give the series a satisfying conclusion; a message, or a definite feeling, just basically a reason for its existence. You really feel like the second two movies were pointless; competent, maybe, but pointless.<br />In the end, three stars seems fair. People almost certainly expected too much, and now they take delight in savaging this movie, but I think it's a fairly solid three stars.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I want to appreciate Lavigne's music but I simply cannot digest such pop trash that has seemingly been recycled in the past by far superior artists, the most recent being Alanis. Avril seems to be defiant just for the sake of being one, without a purpose or perspective. Her satisfaction in ranting is trite and it seems she's focusing more on selling records than discovers who she is and how she can grow as an artist.
B00000IL26|5.0|Although all knowledgeable jazz fans know about Lee Morgan, had he not been murdered over thirty years ago, it is likely that today his name would be as recognizable in popular culture as that of Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. He was a superbly fine player who made consistently strong sides in the 60s for Blue Note and Vee Jay, among other labels. Whether as a leader or a sideman, his musical contributions were extremely formidable and should be deeply investigated by any jazz fan or students of the trumpet. <br />&quot;The Sidewinder&quot; is perhaps Morgan's best known recording, and it is indeed a good listen. The recording also features Joe Henderson (tenor), Barry Harris (piano), Billy Higgins (drums), and Bob Cranshaw (bass). The main title track that opens the recording is a pretty well-known, funky vamp that is so catchy that it is easy to miss the fine interplay between Henderson and Morgan throughout the track.  The remaining tracks on the recording are a little more in the hard bop vein and really showcase Morgan's underrated skills as a composer--it should be noted that all of the tracks on the recording were written by Lee Morgan. As with the case of  Hank Mobley, Morgan should be given a lot more credit for crafting intricate jazz compositions. They are excellent, particularly the gorgeous &quot;Totem Pole&quot; which features beautiful improvisational interludes, novel changes, and a tight, melodic head. <br />Basically, this is not a bad place to start a Lee Morgan collection, if you are interested in hearing his work. However, with an artist of this magnitude, you can't really go wrong getting anything by him.
B000002H6C|5.0|I am totally obsessed with this cd, and you will be too.  Its Metallica's best.  Buy it.  Now.
B000063DI9|5.0|This is my favorite Iron Maiden album.  The first time I heard it I loved every song.  I love how every song connects to each other as a story.  I think the cover art is the coolest.<br />1. MOONCHILD (9.5/10)<br>Another one of those great Maiden openers.  The accoustic passage is awesome and adds feeling to the album.  Then the keyboards come in amazingly.  This is a great song with a great chorus.<br />2. INFINITE DREAMS (9.5/10)<br>This one's more slow paced.  The guitar intro is sick.  Great drumming towards the end.  A great song throughout.<br />3. CAN I PLAY WITH MADNESS (10/10)<br>This song's got one of those chorus' that you can't get out of your head.<br />4. THE EVIL THAT MEN DO (9.5/10)<br>Sweet riffs and the keyboards come in well during the chorus.  Chorus is great but does repeat too much towards the end.<br />5. SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON (10/10)<br>The intro keyboards and drums are solid.  The calm part in the middle is cool which builds up to a great instrumental up to the end.  Incredible epic!<br />6. THE PROPHECY (8.75/10)<br>My least favorite on here, but still great.  The accoustic part at the end is sweet.<br />7. THE CLAIRVOYANT (10/10)<br>I think this is the best song on this amazing album.  The guitars are great and the vocals are really good too.<br />8. ONLY THE GOOD DIE YOUNG (9.25/10)<br>This is another great song.  Great solos and the chorus is catchy.  It ends with the same accoustic passage that Moonchild started with which is a great way to end the album.<br />Every song here is amazing.  If you don't own this masterpiece then I pity you.
B00000DC10|5.0|This is one hell of a hardcore album. It's sophisticated, rhythmic, complex, deep, yet totally hardcore at the same time. I am not usually a fan of punk/hardcore, but this is simply great music. I reccommend this highly.
0792838068|5.0|i could go on and on but i wont, the facts are a) this is probably the most dramatic movie ever made and b) nic cage is the best actor on the planet. holy smokes was he amazing in this and elisabeth shue is perfect by all standards. i also dig &quot;the third man&quot; tributes in there - good job all around tonite i decided this is my favorite movie....which might last a week but it will remain top five forever. I know its a little late but seriously...congrats nic cage you kick ass.
B000089RVX|5.0|GOING UNDER - 5/5...kickaxx<BR>BRING ME TO LIFE - 5/5...self-explanitory.<BR>EVERYBODYS FOOL - 4/5...have NO idea why this is the new single but whatever.<BR>MY IMMORTAL - 4/5...doesnt evoke as much emotion as the Band Version does but its still good.<BR>HAUNTED - 5/5...best song on the record HANDS DOWN<BR>TOURNIQUET - 5/5...beautiful. i wish they got darker and more goth than this but its still great. nice lyrics, guitars, emotion. wonderful<BR>IMAGINARY - 5/5...amy what were you smokin when you wrote this?<BR>TAKING OVER ME - 3/5...too pop and too much of a filler for me.<BR>HELLO - 5/5...TOTALLY redeems the &quot;fallen&quot; effort of Taking Over Me with a deep, moving piano ballad. Amazing. <BR>MY LAST BREATH - 4/5...ehh.. yeah whatever so so song.<BR>WHISPER - 5/5...kickaxx way to end the record. great great great!<BR>except the tribal guys at the end...what the fxxx is up with that??
B000063DHL|5.0|In this album Maiden starts to use synths and keyboards which is perfectly ok because they do such a good job with it you can't help but love it.<br />1. CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME (9.5/10)<BR>Great way to start the album. This song has sweet use of guitars and keyboards do well. The chorus does get a bid repetitive which is the only reason I didn't give it a 10.<br />2. WASTED YEARS (10/10)<BR>Now this song is great! The guitar intro is cool, and sounds futuristic. The chorus is the best part. Can't get enough of this song. It's my favorite on the album.<br />3. SEA OF MADNESS (8.5/10)<BR>Pretty decent song with great vocals. Chorus is good too.<br />4. HEAVEN CAN WAIT (8.5/10)<BR>The intro is great and all but I get annoyed by the repetitive chorus.<br />5. THE LONELINESS OF THE LONG DISTANCE RUNNER (9.5/10)<BR>Man, this song is cool. It has a galloping feel to it, like you're there running too. The lyrics are the only bad part, which are kind of goofy. Still a great song anyway.<br />6. STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND (10/10)<BR>This song has a slower pace than the others. Great riffs and keyboards. I love the guitar solo after the chorus, beautiful!<br />7. DE JA VU (8.5/10)<BR>Another decent song. Starts off good but then when he starts saying &quot;it feels prearranged&quot; and stupid things like that it, sounds goofy. The chorus is goofy too.<br />8. ALEXANDER THE GREAT (9.5/10)<BR>A nice epic but doesn't live up to Hallowed Be Thy Name or Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The guitars sound great and the drums are done well. The thing I don't like is that Bruce sounds like he's reading the lyrics from a text book like some reviewer said before. The chorus is good. Great instrumental part towards the end.<br />All in all this is another Maiden classic that you should have.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|Where is the Aggression? Where is the Intensity? I listen to alot of different &quot;styles&quot; of music, hell i even listen to orchestras. Which &quot;style&quot; i listen to depends on the mood I'm in at the time. Slipknot used to be the &quot;get the F up and go&quot; type. Now I wish that THEY would get the F up and go, please!!! Besides the 4 or 5 parts of some songs, where sould i bang my head to this? I'm always a firm believer that if any band changes their style, they too should change their name.<BR> I'M GLAD I KEPT MY RECIEPT.
0156027321|5.0|one of my favorite books.  A fanscinating look at religion and philosophy.  You wqill be riveted to the last page.  Pi will stay with you for a long while after you finish reading this.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Under My Skin - a kickaxx rock record from Avril that is much different from Let Go.<br />TAKE ME AWAY - 5/5... SICK headbanging song, great emotion, great guitars, deep lyrics, dramatic opening that makes you wonder exactly HOW dark the cd is goin to be. SWEET!<BR>TOGETHER - 5/5...catchy as god knows what. piano adds alot of feeling. great song.<BR>DONT TELL ME - 4/5...really good.  sort of pop but great song.<BR>HE WASN'T - 4.5/5...in this song the guitars are BEST out of the whole record.  Phil X is amazing and the gritty, roughness contributes to the whole punk rock feel.<BR>HOW DOES IT FEEL - 5/5...deep emotion. great song. sort of reminiscent of I'm With You.<BR>MY HAPPY ENDING - 5/5...LOUD song. Freakin sweet though, nice emotion and i LOVE how her voice is cracky towards the end when the guitars pause for a brief moment before kickin it into high gear.<BR>NOBODYS HOME - 5/5...Ben Moody from Evanescence is a fxxxing genius and he makes this song sound damn good. dark, nice metal guitars and amazing emotion. sort of sounds like an Evanescence song.<BR>FORGOTTEN - 6/5...YEAH! this is the &quot;i'm gonna kick your axx&quot; stuff i like to hear from Avril. i love the part at the end when it gets heavy...brilliant. BEST song hands down on the record.<BR>WHO KNOWS - 3/5...my least favorite. its WAY too pop with the lyrics and the whole optimistic theme just breaks the mood of the record making me want to say &quot;SHUT THE FXXX UP!&quot;. but the verses and bridge have great tunes and i love the guitars.<BR>FALL TO PIECES - 4/5...also the other pop song. it sounds sort of Michelle Branch but very good.<BR>FREAK OUT - 5/5...awesome PUNK anthem! every lyric is relatable and every riff leaves you wanting to hear the song again and again and again!<BR>SLIPPED AWAY - 10/5... i really have no words for this song other than to make sure to hear a wonderful, dark (though sad) song.  its very close to alot of people, in terms of the lyrics, and its a beautifully written and composed song. Unbelievable ending to a unbelievable album.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i think this cd is a great slipknot album slipknot is not as heavy any more but still kicks ass i like anything they make and for parents its clean.f@#k you if you think this sucks it rocks im a true maggot not you freaks you hate the new slipknot
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Does anyone care, he asks. Here is the answer: WE STILL DO. Guns N'Roses had inspired helluva lotta bands and fans, and it will go on and on I guess. My younger sister and her friends are crazy about them, and they're only 14. It'd be great if the original members would team up together and tour the USA at least, they'd be surprised HOW MUCH PEOPLE STILL LOVE THEM AND GO CRAZY FOR THEIR SONGS. Salute the rock'n'roll stars! Guns n' Roses at their best at this compilation. As a Guns N' Roses' fan since 1988, I'd recommend this album to every young fan who's interested to know more about this superb band and needs to start up with something. Great songs here. Come and rock!
B0000VAFO0|1.0|I thought this movie was going to be awesome. My god was i wrong. First of all, this movie made the vampires suck. They couldnt even use any of their super-human abilities like running really, really fast. They couldnt jump, they dam-sho couldnt fight. This movie made the vampires just a couple a english pricks that sat around and drank wine all day. Second, the werewolves. What happened!? I know that werewolves are strong and everything but dam! I mean a human that was just turned werewolf fighting an ancient vampire and kicking his anus all over the place is just too much. So what if he was both vampire and werewolf. The vampires in this movie aint worth shiat so he didnt get much power from them. And whats up with vampires and werewolves using weapons. I can understand swords and stuff but not guns. I have to say though that the only thing good about this movie was the story line. And there was so many suck-points about this movie that the story line sucked. They shouldnt have made it were the werewolves can change on their own. I just hope that no one else buys this movie. Dont waste your time with this WORTHLESS movie. And Ill admit I did buy the movie. I watched it once, and then I fed it to a sledge-hammer.
B0000CABBW|5.0|I got this film for my daughter but found it so enchanting I've watched it several times with her, and even by myself. The performances are inspired and the story is both mythical and timely.  Its emotional impact is enormous--though I weep when I watch it, it is neither sad nor tragic.  In fact it's one of the most uplifting movies I can remember seeing in ages.  There is nothing saccharine or manipulative about it.  The music really adds to and enhances the story--it is both haunting and evocative.  The combination of all the elements make this film unforgettable.  The most astounding part is how the story is told with the simplicity and directness of a documentary so that when you realize it is fictional you are amazed at the end of the film.  'Whale Rider' is really a movie you will want to own and watch many times.  It is also a perfect movie for a family with older children (its realism could be a bit frightening for a younger child).  <br />If you wondered how a young girl of 14 got an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in her acting debut, you will no longer wonder after you see this film--she's luminous.  I think this film is a masterpiece and will become a classic--can't recommend it too highly.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Let's get one thing straight - A7X is easily THE best new band to emerge within a few years.  I'm a big fan of many bands, but this one just blows them away.  I can picture many years in the future, people will look at this album and think, &quot;This is a masterpiece.&quot;  And it is.  This album is right up there with some of the best albums to date, like Rush's 2112, Iron Maiden's The Number of the Beast, and AFI's The Art of Drowning.  A7X's first cd, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, while an amazing hardcore/metal album, is no comparison to this masterpeice.<br />Comparing the two albums, you may at first like STST more, as the intro to it, To End the Rapture, is amazing.  On the other hand, Waking the Fallen (the song), is rather weak.  But after the first songs are over, WTF's superiority completely emerges.  The second song is Unholy Confessions, a brilliant work of heavy metal art, wich is creepily reminicent of 80's metal.  It then goes into Chapter 4, an incredible vocal and instrumental powerhouse.  Once you've reached Reminisions, you know this band is simply amazing, because the changes in tempo and volume, the at times extremely heavy and at others light and soft, its just a musical explosion of greatness.<br />Then the album takes a break from the brilliance, and does the song Desecrate Through Reverence.  While this song is still great, its no where near the past three songs.  But there's no worry, because then you get into one of the best songs on the album, Eternal Rest, which starts out with a CRAZY guitar solo by one of the greatest guitar players of all time, Synyster Gates.  The song then slows down into one of the just plain coolest peices of music ever written.  Then you get to Second Heartbeat, my personal favorite track on the album.  Throughout the first 6 minutes of the song, its just an amazing song, but once you get to the guitar solo at the end, which is possibly THE greatest solo of all time, you're in love.<br />The album then settlesdown once again with Radiant Eclipse.  Like Desecrate, this song isn't an instant favorite.  But its still a great song.  After this, all of a sudden you hear a piano.  And the album goes into a power balad masterpiece called I Won't See You Tonight Part 1.  This 9 minute work of art is simply such a great song throughout, its impossible to stop listening.  After part 1, it goes into part 2, which is filled with anger, unlike the incredibly sad part 1.  But this song is great too, and simply a joy to listen to.<br />After that, it slows things down with Clairvoyant Disease.  While this song is a lot slower and softer than a lot of the tracks on this album, its definitely a great song.  Then you get to the grand finale, And All things Will End.  This song starts out aucustic, then immediatly goes into a great metal song, which like Unholy Confessions, is quite reminiscent of 80's metal.  The album ends with a constantly slowing guitar solo by Gates, and you're left incredibly happy.<br />Basically, if you're into metal, this album is a must buy.  There's not one bad moment on this cd, absolutely no filler.  You can't get much better than this.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is one of, if not, THE best metal recording ever, man. A very good listen.seeing as there are no bad ones on here. It makes you wanna cry if you listen to this album and then St.Anger but yeah..
B0001L3LUE|4.0|I enjoyed this film if only to see a Washington insider show some humility for once. However, I do wonder how much of the film was motivated by a need to find redemption as opposed to a genuine desire to talk about hard-won lessons.<br />Unfortunately, many of McNamara's lessons were paid for by the lives of thousands of young men in the prime of their lives. I have to ask: Were thousands of years of history before Vietnam for naught? Was the high-IQ McNamara only able to learn the lesson of &quot;empathy&quot; through &quot;hands-on&quot; experimentation?<br />If nothing else, McNamara has documented the potential danger of blindly following a liberal impulse - of thinking that you know better than the collected wisdom that has preceded you ... the idea that current events have no precedent and therefore history is silent at best.<br />Unfortunately, it seems that &quot;conservatives&quot; may be equally incapable of humility and learning from the past as Bush's elective war with Iraq develops into a quagmire. When will idealists on both the left and the right get it through their heads that other human beings do not exist for their pleasure and experimentation?
B000065V42|2.0|i whould have liked it better if it were  widescreen i think fullscreen movies are a thing of the past please do away with full screen if possible but if the movie was only filmed in full screen then i dont mind but if the movie can be made for full screen then it should thank you yours truely  a disturbed fan of disney movies.
B000002KHF|5.0|I was only familiar with the Brown Eyed Girl and Gloria Van Morrison but bought this because of the strong 5 star rating with nearly 130 reviews. They are right. This is a great CD filled with easily listened to (not easy listening) music. The lyrics are absolutely heartfelt. The speed of the music fluctuates from not to fast to slow and cool. This would be great entertaining music for a small group of people or just for that one person.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Avril Lavigne is back and if you liked her debut, &quot;Let Go,&quot; you will definitely like her second effort. However, she probably isn't going to win any new fans with this disc, which seems to be similar to her first disc, with a minutely harder edge.<br />The drawbacks are that Ms. Lavigne hasn't got anything as catchy has her three big hits: &quot;Complicated,&quot; &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot; and &quot;I'm With You&quot; here. Not that what is on the disc is bad, because it's very good. However it's unlikely that any of the songs will be a breakout hit as large as any from her first album, which is a shame, because there's a lot of good stuff here.<br />As a whole, the album is very listenable, with Avril's rough and golden voice belting out her commentary about women taking charge of their lives and finding their loves. But it doesn't feel like we've gone anywhere new. In fact, it was stated that the first single, &quot;Don't Tell Me,&quot; was written before any of the material on &quot;Let Go.&quot; <br />Despite all, there are amusing moments and clever lyrics throughout, and a solid vocal performance from the Canadian Queen of Angst, a label that may not be completely deserved, but won't be shaken off by any of the tracks on &quot;Under My Skin.&quot; <br />Overall, this is a worthwhile disc that won't disappoint Avril's legions of supporters.<br />Recommended.
B0000013G9|4.0|This one is the best by TLC! All of them have good to great tracks but this one was as near to perfect as this group ever got! From &quot;Creep&quot; to &quot;Waterfalls&quot; to their version of the Prince classic &quot;If I Was Your Girlfriend&quot; to &quot;Diggin' On You&quot;, this one was good pop/R&amp;B before it got commercialized.
B0000648WZ|4.0|The critics initially struck down the movie. Verhoeven was even called a pro fascist by some morons because of the movie.   Luckily some people caught on to the satire and it has since become more appreciated among movie buffs.  Check out how much the movie resembles old war propaganda films. This was intentional.  Root for the bugs?  Of course, you're not necessarily supposed to like the main characters.
B000002NE4|5.0|I am so happy to be ordering &quot;The Boatman's Call&quot;; it was stolen, along with all my other CDs, from my car a while ago.  It is just such a dark, moody, wonderful album.  The music itself is understated and lush, and it does not overpower Nick Cave's voice.  As for the aforementioned singer, his lyrics are so dark that they are unforgettable.  He sings passionately but not over-the-top; this whole album (and I do mean the whole, because this is one record that you can listen to from start to finish and get a cohesive feeling about) is just right on the mark.  I also recommend &quot;The Best of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds&quot; if you like this one, or even if you don't. :)
B0001NBMBC|4.0|This isnt Slipknot. It is Stone Sour.  It seems to me that corey has blended both bands together, and did a good job, however this is not slipknot. i was expecting something more like their self titled album, but he brought too much of his stone sour ways with him for this one. keep slipknot slipknot and keep stone sour separate.
6305205639|5.0|i do say get this! its an awsum video that has over 2hrs of live Metallica. although if you want the older songs like Master of Puppets, Am I Evil?,etc. to sound like Metallica then i suggest you buy Cliff 'Em All. But if you like their newer stuff off of Load,Reload,Metallica(often called the black album),the song One, or Garage Inc. then you should definitely get this video. if you dont want your kids listenin to a few curse words like f**k,s**t,etc. then dont let em watch it unless you turn the volume down in between the songs. overall this is an awsum video an i give it a 5star rating.
0345451325|5.0|This book is awesome!!!! The author put lots of details and blood into the story and talks about John (master cheifs0 and his life before the game.

Its one of the Inner colonies and is basically second to planet EARTH. It has SUPER-MAC orbital defence guns and hundreds of UNSC ships patrol the space around planet REACH-It cannot fall...but it does.<BR>This books introduces most of the terms and charachters, so is a must read. sort of &quot;read this first&quot;<BR>__________<BR>HALO (Xbox game): you have to play the game to find out what happens. Believe it or not the game has a very strong storyline to it.<BR>__________<BR>The Flood: Ok, you cannot play the game because you don't have $200 to invest, read all about it in &quot;The Flood&quot;. This one tells you what really happens on HALO. plus a lot more...<BR>There are things in this book that are not in the game. Also this is the only book that tells the Covenant part of the story. So you get to know Covenant Elite names, like Zuka Zamamee the Elite, Gagaw the Grunt and Yayap the Grunt. <BR>___________<BR>First Strike: After you have played the game or read &quot;The Flood&quot; you would want to know what happens before HALO 2.

B000005RQT|4.0|'In Rock' has always been one of my favourite albums from the 70's golden era of rock &amp; roll. 'Child In Time' blew my mind the first time I heard it. It's here in all it's glory as well as all the other tracks on this expanded edition. Some albums retain their magic through the years while others flame out in a hurry. 'In Rock' retains that magic these many years later. Although it does sound dated(both performance-wise and sonically)it is a classic in the DP catalog. The booklet is very informative but lacks lyrics which is strange for a special edition. Sound quality is best catagorized as 'raw', even the booklet explains this in detail(needles pinned to the red)so if you are expecting a 1000 veils lifted remaster, you'll be disappointed. Missing is the high end which is sad since a lot of detail is in that 16k region. Compared to the Warner Bros. version, this version is better but not that much better. It still sounds distorted and grungy which was probably the point to begin with. Master tapes were used but I would have liked to have heard a remixed version, re-eq'd of course. Still, it's worth having since it will be the definite edition for now. The bonus tracks are interesting but hardly essential. Picture disc. 20 tracks/78.29.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|listen people are angry because this cd is not as loud as others. but its still really heavy. joey the drummer is better than other. yes there are 2 acoustic song but the one circle i think is really good! this cd still is a great headbanger cd!. so dont read these haters reviews. if your not sure about borrow it from a friend or download it! slipknot is still the men behind the masks
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Its ok for a band to change.  Just cuz a band wants to add melody doesnt mean theyve sold out.  Do you want to hear &quot;Heretic Anthem&quot; 12 times over? I sure dont.  I loved the debut, I liked Iowa.  I thought Iowa got irritating with songs like &quot;Skin Ticket&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot;.  I feel like their debut was their best work yet.  I feel that Vol. 3 fits right in between.  I love the fact that Slipknot took a chance.  I love the fact that they rolled the dice.  I give them and Rick Rubin tons of credit.  Just cuz a metal band tries something which isnt crazy heavy with blast beats or screaming, doesnt mean theyve gone soft completely.  Remember when &quot;White Pony&quot; came out? People still stuck behind the Deftones.  You dont have to like it, but also understand that its ok for bands to venture out and try different things.  Theres vintage Slipknot on here with a good blend of melody.  This album shows musical diversity, something which is possesed by bands with talent.  Here, Slipknot shows off all of their skills.  As a longtime fan of this band, I can say that I love this album and I really cant stop listening to it.  It sounds NOTHING like Stone Sour (are there turntable parts on Stone Sour records? absolutely not)<br />Stand Out tracks:<br />The Blister Exists:  Some of the best drumwork ever.  Great second track<br />Before I Forget:  Vintage brutal Slipknot.  Could have easily been on one of the other albums.  <br />Pulse Of The Maggots:  Fans who feel let down should still like this song.  A typical Slipknot Anthem<br />The Nameless:  My favorite song on the CD.  Frightening lyrics, nice slowdown in the chorus which shifts right back into metal.  A complete and well rounded song.  <br />Vermillion Pt. 2:  Some great effects on this song.  The &quot;she isnt real&quot; voice over at the end is extrememly powerful.
B00012FXAE|4.0|The first 3 films in the alien series are all amazing in their own way. This one is the least serious of the bunch, basically just a popcorn action flick. But possibly the best popcorn action flick ever. This film is so re-watchable. I highly recommend the original theatrical release. It doesnt give away as much as the directors cut (which would totally ruin the film is you saw this first). The thetrical release gives so much suspense leading up to the action where as the directors cut eliminates this. Although the added scenes are of much interest once you have seen the theatrical release a few thousand times. The special effects in this film TOTALLY hold up today and i'll tell you why. NO CGI is used. Awesome. The commentary is interesting , but mainly for the fact of how bitter James Cameron sounds about Alien 3. Alien 3 being the far more noir version in the francise. Well James they had to do something different didnt they. And unlike you I found it kind of funny and poetically realistic that the characters that had so much effort put into their survival in your action extravaganza were simply killed off in the first scene of Alien 3. Their in lies the beautiful tone of the film. You missed it. It's not always about giving them what they want. But more what they need.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This CD, thank God, is a re-emergence of talent which desperately lacked in Iowa.  Sure it's not as hard all the way through, but as someone finally leaving my teens and maturing a bit I was glad to see that they abandoned the Iowa satanic approach which was more of a gimmic than anything.  Eventually you mature a bit and you get sick of all that 666 crap, and you see through that.  Iowa sucked.  It was nothing more than Slipknot becoming a sideshow and Corey saw that.  No wonder he wanted out.  There's always a backlash when you change but it needed to happen or Slipknot would have faded away ala Gwar (and I already know everyone hates this comparison but it's true) . With efforts like this they may be around for a bit longer.  This is REAL music.
B00012FXB8|4.0|Dont listen to any of these nay-sayers. This film is amazing, its definitely not for mainstream american audiences who need to be spoonfed their movies. Its much darker , layered and more serious than most films. I always enjoyed the theatrical release of Alien 3, I saw it twice at the movies. But the real gem is the restored workprint which is closer to the directors original vision. It is common knowledge that first time director David Fincher was put in many difficult situations by the producers of this film and did not end up getting the film he wanted. Hense is non involvement with this special edition. The theatrical version would probably garner at least 3 1/2 stars from me, but the workprint version is more like a 4 1/2 star movie, even more depth added. I probably would have had a slight amalgamation of the 2 versions as a final cut myself. The only let down are some of the CGI effects in certain sequences, but isnt that always the way. When will they learn that CGI is not the way. This film IS as good as the 2 previous, maybe not as entertaining as Aliens, but a hell of a lot more believable, and maybe not the originality of the original, but hey it is a sequel after all. God only knows why they let Alien Ressurection be viewed by anyone, that film should have been buried.

Mr. Polgar came up with an interesting and comprehensive collection of compositions and miniature games that will keep yourself and your chess buddies entertained for many hours.<BR>There are two things I would consider for future editions:<BR>- In the miniature games section, the author should allow the reader to figure out the winning combination instead of simply putting the solution below the corresponding diagram.<BR>- I was expecting to find more problems from the composition legend Sam Lloyd. I was a bit disappointed to find only a few of them.
B0000AYJXR|2.0|How any critic can call Looney Tunes: Back in Action an exercise in franchise promotion but not puke at the 80-minute commercial that is Space Jam is beyond me.<br />Our plot has Danny Devito play the voice of an evil, monster type businessman who's theme park is failing. In desperation he sends 5 little creatures to capture the Looney Tunes and bring them back as the new attraction.<br />So...where is Looney Tune land? Apparently it's underground. And digging up any golf ball hole will eventually lead to it. When the Looney Tunes challenge the would-be kidnappers to a basketball game they kidnap Michael Jordan to be on their team.<br />The quality of the film nosedives from here on. Jordan's acting is so wooden it's mahogany. He expresses no confusion, joy or surprise at being yanked into Looney Tune land and confronted by all the toons. 'Bugs Bunny you're a cartoon you're not real', he says in the most flat, boring and dullest way (missing commas intended as he doesn't use them).<br />And then the big game follows. Once it's over, and there's no reason left to continue watching, the film goes on for another 10 minutes (to beef the running time up 'feature length') with the basketball/Jordan story. It's rubbish.<br />It's no surprise that the film is directed by Joe Pytka (he's NOT Joe Dante that's for sure), a man who has never done any other features but over a 1000 TV ads, or something. Space Jam is nowt but 100% proof Warner like to whore out their most famous creation to make a few quick, and cheap, bucks. It's heartbreaking, heinous stuff.<br />Casting Michael Jordan alongside the Looney Tunes is not inspired and imaginative. It's crass and desperate. Now they can attract sports fans AND kiddies. And Michael Jordan of all people! He's not a good actor and his fame outside of the U.S. is minimal to say the least. Moreso today.<br />The only part of the film that comes (very, very remotely) close to the true spirit of the Looney Tunes is the score. James Newton Howard (a truly bizarre choice, how about Jerry Goldsmith, Bruce Broughton or even Danny Elfman) recognizes the classic Looney Tunes themes and uses them appropriately in certain moments but the rest of the score is generic and uninspired.<br />Back in Action was intelligent, witty and satirical. Space Jam is corny, cheap and classless. It's an absolute travesty. How can we honestly take seriously a movie that has every cast member awe at Michael Jordan, has not too subtle product placement for McDonalds and has the Looney Tunes (one of the most ingenious creations in history) exploited in the most shameless and guilt free manner. With Space Jam, Warner showed that they'd cash in the Looney Tunes at a pawn shop for $5 if they could. A total lack of respect for Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng and Robert McKimson.<br />And they don't even act Looney. The only laughs come from Bugs and Daffy. And it's sporadic and inconsistent. Producer Ivan Reitman (who has no experience and no business with this franchise) managed to convince Bill Murray to appear in this drek (for about 10 minutes) so the trailer could boast an ACTUAL star other than Jordan. Murray's performance is the bare minimum and has a let's-get-this-over-with feel (though Murray working below-par is still miles ahead of many other actors at the top of their game). His appearance in the film is massively oversold.<br />It's just not fair that THIS is a big hit while Back In Action flopped horribly. I consider it the biggest miscarriage in justice ever. I still blame the marketing for Back in Action. It was bad, REAL bad. But still has some sort of quiet dignity about it when compared to the McDonalds promoted, in your face junk that was Space Jam's marketing. Is it any wonder Joe Dante had Back In Action nicknamed 'The Anti-Space Jam movie'?<br />And just what the hell is a Space Jam anyway? It's not even set in Space!!!<br />It took Warner 3 tries but the finally released the movie in its original aspect ratio. The DVD presents the film is 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with pretty active Dolby 5.1 sound. There are loads of features but they are all fluff. Some 80's Looney Tunes shorts are included too.e DVD presents the film is 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with pretty active Dolby 5.1 sound. There are loads of features but they are all fluff.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|first off, this album is great.  And as for the rest of this post, im going to verbaly bash you people who think you &quot;know&quot; slipknot.  honestly, at first i didnt like slipknot when their first album came out, but god help me, they grew on me.  These guys are so talented.  corey is hands down one of the best vocalists in modern day rock/metal, and the boy can write.  Yes there are some mindless chants, but they are a stadium packing, crowd f***ing band, and write songs to get the crowd in on the show (chanting along).  This album is fantstic, a good blend of melody and blood curdeling schrills that would make ozzy wet the bed.  Not many bands can play hard as hell, and then lighten it up with accoustic tracks... that being said, these boys are far from &quot;soft&quot;.  But let me also say this, to anyone out there who doesnt like this album, fine, thats your opinion, but these guys blister it...like it or not...and also to those who day that slipknot has sold out........they have a record deal (which takes talent), have toured their butts off, do what they feel is good music, and i sure as S**T don't see you pencil neck geeks up there doing what they are doing! So until you can prove your better than them...SHUT UP!
B000002H33|5.0|Master Of Puppets (the last album with their late bassist Cliff Burton) is arguably Metallica's best album ever. Kirk Hammett's lightning fast guitar solos, Cliff's roaring bass, Lars Ulrich's in your face drum work, and James Hetfield's vocals just kill for me. Battery, Master Of Puppets, Welcome Home (Sanitarium), Disposable Heroes, and Damage Inc. are the best songs. A must have for true Metallica fans. Rest In Peace Cliff my friend.
B000063DFQ|5.0|This album I feel is the second step in creating a perfect Maiden album. They finally have the line-up and the song craftwork is coming. This album would be up there but I feel POWERSLAVE is just too good. <br />1. WHERE EAGLES DARE <BR>Great opening! Not as fast as I'd expect, it seems Maiden is trying to mainstream it up a little. 5/5.<br />2. REVELATIONS (5/5)<br />3. FLIGHT OF ICARUS<BR>Catchy, well-written both lyrically and instrumentally. 5/5<br />4. DIE WITH YOUR BOOTS ON <BR>Iron Maiden gets carried on with their choruses and this song is no exception, but it is not a bad song once a chance is given. 5/5<br />5. THE TROOPER <BR>Classic guitar riff. Ohhh I get so pumped up listening to this song. One of the best Maiden songs ever! 5/5<br />6. STILL LIFE <BR>Very different but very good. A little less technically and a little more poppy on this one. 5/5<br />7. QUEST FOR FIRE (2/5)<BR>Skip.<br />8. SUN AND STEEL <BR>Ehhh... Can ayone say B-Side Filler? (3/5)<br />9. TO TAME A LAND <BR>Great finishing track, a lot of people are down on this one but c'mon take a listen! 5/5
B000002GJS|4.0|I consider Bryan Adams' 1987 &quot;Into the Fire&quot; his best album.  It was his most complete album and showed a more serious and socially aware side to Adams that had not been seen on his first 4 albums.  However, &quot;Into the Fire&quot; didn't generate the commercial success that its predecessor &quot;Reckless&quot; had done.   As a result, Bryan definitely went back to basics on &quot;Waking Up The Neighbours&quot; by returning to those songs that are of a 20 something male adult.   Going back to basics didn't come without change.  The good news is despite the changes, Bryan still manages to put out a solid album and once again had the major commerical success he had with &quot;Reckless&quot;.  The bad news is that some of the changes to affect the depth of this collection and as a result this is more of a 4 star effort as opposed to the last 3 albums that I rated 5 stars.<br /> &quot;Waking Up the Neighbours&quot; marked the end of the Bryan Adams/Jim Vallance songwriting combination that had been the staple of the 1st five albums.  Adams and Vallance would combine for only 4 songs on this album as Bryan started a new era with Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange (Better known as Mr. Shania Twain) as his main songwriting partner.   It is also worth noting that Lange would be credited as a co-writer on the songs Adams did with Vallance.   Another change is that Bob Clearmountain, the master mixer who would co-produce the last 4 studio albums for Bryan Adams was no longer the co-producer.  In once again is Lange who also takes the co-producer duties while Clearmountain still stays on as the mixer.    Bryan's studio musicians are still in tact as Mickey Curry (Drums), Tommy Mandel (Keyboards), Dave Taylor (Bass), and Keith Scott (Guitar) still prove they are as good you can get in the business.<br />This CD has 15 tracks - this makes for 75 minutes of music.   Of the 15 tracks - some are very good songs like &quot;Can't Stop This Thing We Started&quot;, &quot;ThoughtI Died and Gone to Heaven&quot;, &quot;Not Guilty&quot;, &quot;Vanishing&quot;, and &quot;There Will Never Be Another Tonight&quot;.  There are some good songs like &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It For You&quot;, &quot;Do I Have to Say the Words&quot;, &quot;House Arrest&quot;, and &quot;If You Wanna Leave Me&quot;.   There is also some songs that I don't like such as &quot;Is Your Mama Gonna Miss Ya&quot;, &quot;Hey Honey I'm Packin It In&quot;, and &quot;Touch the Hand&quot;.  The album title comes from a line in the song &quot;House Arrest&quot;.   The negative is the 15 songs.  Perhaps if this was an 8 or 9 song album, Adams would be looking at another 5 star album, but there is some stuff like like &quot;Touch the Hand&quot; that I just wonder &quot;What is this doing here?&quot;<br />This album contains &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It For You&quot; from the movie &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;.  This was a song wasn't a Vallance song.   It would become Bryan's biggest selling single and one of the biggest sellers of all time.   Although I don't think its an &quot;Adams song&quot;, the version that is contained on this album is 6.5 minutes and is much better than the overplayed shorter version you will hear on commerical radio.  It is a classic Adams ballad though.<br />The Vallance songs are &quot;House Arrest&quot;, &quot;Do I Have to Say the Words&quot;, &quot;There Will Never Be Another Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Depend on Me'.  Surprisingly, with the exception of &quot;There Will Never Be Another Tonight&quot;, there isn't that legendary Adams/Vallance song.  Lange does a very good job at becoming Adams co-collaborator in the songwriting department.   Two songs that are very underrated on this album are &quot;Not Guilty&quot; and &quot;Vanishing&quot;.   &quot;Not Guilty&quot; is a song in which Bryan and Lange draw an analogy of romance to the legal system .&quot;Vanishing&quot; is probably the best song on the album.   It's another analogy songbetween rich wasting away money to a romance wasting away.  It contains some powerful vocals especially when Bryan sings &quot;You're gonna giss ge when I'm gone.  Watcha gonna do without a shoulder to lean on?&quot;<br />Classic Adams sound is alive and well on this album too.  The Commercial singles  &quot;Can't Stop This Thing We Started&quot;, &quot;Thought I Died and Gone to Heaven&quot;, &quot;and &quot;There Will Never Be Another Tonight&quot; do a great job at capturing the sound as well as the lesser known &quot;If You Wanna Leave Me&quot;.   &quot;If You Wanna Leave Me&quot; shows a bit of the blues which will become more prevelent on his subsequent work from this album.   Another thing to note is the background vocals on this album are incredible.  They are credited to &quot;The Tuck Back Twins&quot;.  Much of the background vocals sound like a bunch of partying guys on songs like &quot;Can't StopThis Thing We Started&quot;, &quot;There Will Never Be Another Tonight&quot; and &quot;Not Guilty&quot; or sound just real good like in &quot;Thought I Died and Gone to Heaven&quot;.  It's really good stuff.<br />The CD liner notes contain all of the lyrics.   The only thing is - the songwriting are bunched together and are difficult to read.  The other thing is there are guest musicians called &quot;Honorary Dudes of Leisure&quot;, but the 'Dudes' aren't mapped to the songs they participate on.   Another negative is that with Clearmountain as the producer, Bryan and Clearmountain had the perfect formula for picking the starting track, ending track, and ordering all of the ones in-between.   With Lange, they don't seem to be able to order things as well.<br />There's a lot of positive with this CD and if you want the last great studio album by Bryan Adams, I would definitely recommend getting this one.   The ones that follow won't be quite as good as this.
B000063DFN|5.0|This album is the band in their prime with their line-up that seemed to blend the best (Dickinson, Harris, Murray, McBrain and Smith), everything is perfect on this album; especially the guitar. I can't think of a more perfect representation of rock guitar music during the 80's than this album.<br />   <BR>            <BR>  <BR>  <BR>1. ACES HIGH (5/5)<BR>This is a great high-speed traditional Iron Maiden album opener and it does its damage. This song is flawless from start to finish and sometimes I have a hard time playing the album all the way through because I repeat this song.<br />2. 2 MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT (5/5)<BR>A big hit for the band. It was a great song but Maiden has done better. Great guitar work and a great chorus.<br />3. LOSFER WORDS (BIG 'ORRA) (4/5)<BR>Great instrumental perfect for this album but it's not as good as Genghis Khan or Transylvania.<br />4. FLASH OF THE BLADE (5/5)<BR>Great song with a cool sounding guitar tapping pattern for the verses.<br />5. THE DUELLISTS (5/5)<BR>Not a bad one, just nothing special. It has a pretty good instrumental part.<br />6. BACK IN THE VILLAGE (7/10)<BR>The weakest song on the album.<br />7. POWERSLAVE (10/10)<BR>Perfect Maiden song. Enough said. Well written, melodic and guitariffic.<br />8. RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER (10/10)<BR>13 minutes long! But none of it is filler time, it's a great listen with some excellent guitar work and a perfect way to end one of the best albums of the 80's.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|If you heard 'Are you gonna be my girl' and thought this was another garage rock band you are so wrong.<br />They are somewhere in beween Garage Rock and Soft Rock/Pop and are pretty bad at both styles, either way, if you want the former, get White Stripes, Strokes or Mars Volta, and if you want the latter you better get some Oasis, Travis or Coldplay.<br />BTW 'Come around again' and 'Move On' are both lame Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here rip offs.
B000063DHL|5.0|Well... Iron Maiden hit its peek with POWERSLAVE and so after that there is nowhere to go but down and that is where this album was headed, but that's not to say the band didn't have a few good punches to throw, but after such a powerful record, the fans expected more but many fans feel the delivery failed, but I think it was one of the last great albums of the time, before this band and the genre became washed-up.<br />During the mid-80's a phenomenon was sweeping the music scene globally and locally; synthesizers. It seemed every band had a synth player, even Van Halen and The Ramones were using synths in nearly every song by 1984. So now came Maiden's turn, but what set them apart from the others is that they didn't over do it. The synths are faint at the most and overall complement the music rather than date it.<br />CAUGHT SOMEWHERE IN TIME- Normal Maiden opener but this time with synths! Hah? Right! 5/5<br />WASTED YEARS- This has to be one of the most powerful &quot;get off your ass and do something with your life songs&quot; I've ever heard. Definate influence on 90's Power-metal. 5/5<br />SEA OF MADNESS- Pretty heavy song, great guitar and vocals. 5/5<br />HEAVEN CAN WAIT- Ehh... i've heard better from Maiden, not too bad, but I think the lyrics need work. 4/5<br />THE LONELINESS OF A LONG DISTANCE RUNNER - Great song but the lyrics are bad just plain awful. 4/5<br />DEJA VU- The album takes a little turn and mellows it out and this is another strong track up there with STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND and WASTED YEARS. 5/5<br />STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND - best song on the album! just listen to that solo!! and take in those lyrics baby! 5/5<br />ALEXANDER THE GREAT - I'm a History major and when I was in high school this is the song that pretty much got through a chapter in History and influenced me to study. I think this song maybe a poor attemt to recreate THE RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER. 5/5
B00006690G|1.0|I have written bad reviews of eminem before but the eminem show is definitly the worst thing to ever come from him.  When it was first released it was a really big deal but I don't see what's so great about it.  I borrowed it and listened to it but I coldn't stand to listen to the whole thing.  The song white america is basicly a disclaimer saying that he can't help it if white people listen to his music.  The reason why only white people listen to his music is because he's racist but he wont admit it.  Eminem is such a cocky jerk I don't know how anyone can stand to listen to him or work with him.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|When we think Quentin Tarintino, we know we're in for a surprise. And the Kill Bill movies were no exception. But, as we<BR>know, most Original Movie Soundtracks (OMS) are just gags to knock off a few bucks. Well this album is one of the few acceptions. And mentioning the fact that Quentin Tarintino shouldn't hurt at all. The album is as unique as the movies. It contains all the songs from the movie and some extra. And why they put a discretion label is very odd. The worst word I heard was hell. If you you liked the movie you should like this album!!!         By Jonathan Oliver, Age 13
B0001NBMBC|5.0|i knew goin in that alot of people would bash this album simply because its a new sound for SlipKnot and these are the same people that call theirselves real Maggots. Give me a break you all are a fu**in joke if you would open up your mind and listen to it then you will see this is a change in the right direction. Bands cant do the same thing over and over and over. Change is sometimes a good thing when the band can continue to make great music and thats what SlipKnot has done. This is a GREAT cd dont listen to all these other mindless little girls that wanna bash it because its a new sound these people are stupid and probably the same people that claim to be die hard maggots and listen to britney, nsync, bsb, christina and so on....a bunch of little 14 and 15 year old losers thats will never ammount to anything in life and probably never even graduate high school.
0060930349|4.0|Paul Johnson, who wrote the epochal _Modern Times_, has more recently delivered this behemoth on the history of America.  This excellent work, which overall I heartily recommend to all Amazon customers, demostrates what I pointed out in my review of _Modern Times_; Johnson, like most historians, is at his best when he's talking about events far enough in the past that they can be objectively analyzed.  From the 16th century right up through the early Cold War period, Johnson's analysis is, IMO, unparalleled in its clear-eyed objectivity.  He takes hard looks at the follies of both Left and Right.  Civil War fans will particularly be interested in his word-portraits of Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis.<br />Johnson stumbles, though (and I feel I can legitimately say this as a conservative) in his recounting of more recent events.  As I remarked in my _Modern Times_ review, when it comes to post-1950 history, Paul Johnson's writing probably best belongs in National Review as an op-ed.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  National Review is the flagship think-mag of conservatism, and Johnson's writing lays out the conservative view in smart, crisp fashion.  One would have wished, though, that he would have taken a more nuanced view of Watergate, which, as in _Modern Times_, he dismisses as a case of liberal hysteria.  Most of us (those of us who are old enough to remember) remember the proceedings somewhat differently.<br />All the same, though, this is a most worthy work, written in the same crisp, incisive style as all his other historical works.  Buy it and be enlightened by the story of how the American people came to be as they are today.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|I feel Clapton idolizes Johnson a little too much, on this recording, it's as though he was afraid to be compared unfavorably to his musical hero. I looked forward to the release of this cd, especially after what I felt was the fine job Clapton did on &quot;From the Cradle&quot;.<BR> But the true charm of Johnson's 28 recordings was not that they were original, which they weren't, but that it was the work of one man and one guitar. And I doubt that Clapton lost sight of that, he was just intimidated by it, and I think he was wrong. A fresh interpretation would not have been as bad as this cd is.<BR>  To get a better idea of Johnson's influence on Blues music, read Elijah Wald's 'Escaping the Delta:Robert Johnson and the Invention of The Blues' it gives you a good perspective on the man.

B00005V9HA|2.0|This is a warning to any horror fan. This movie is extremely disgusting and has absouletly NO point what so ever. I feel bad for jeffery combs, because of this movie his repuataion is now worse than ever. The gore is over the top, and there is no plot, besides phystoic zombies trying to kill people. <br />Here is the gore that this movie has: Decapitation by shovel, bitten off fingers, a bone saw through the stomach, someone pulling off some guys skin, than revealing the skull, and with a bone saw removes the skull, and picks up the brain and plays with it, we see a guy shove a Q-tip in a hole in someones for head, a cat with a broken neck, a stomach exploding with organs coming to life and attacking someone, eyes exploding, a head being impaled on a needle and lots more blood plus a head that falls off after being hit by a woman. For violence, we get someone being hit in the head with a shovel, someone being thrown into the wall with extreme force breaking the glass, slapping, hitting and punching to ward off a dead zombie.<br />Overall, I think this movie was a waste of money. But, now that you know what the movie is truly about, you can make that descision for yourself.
B000001EXR|2.0|This has got to be Kiss' worst album ever! Why? It has absolutely no energy or excitement anywhere on it, unlike their previous album, &quot;Revenge&quot;, which was just heavy as hell and rocked. Most other Kiss albums were really fun to listen to, with only a few exceptions, like &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Unmasked&quot; and &quot;Crazy Nights&quot;. &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; is just plain dull &amp; boring. I'm sure the band thought they were being clever by doing something different, but instead they were following somebody else's lead instead of being leaders themselves. The songs here are depressing as well. It must have been raining outside the whole time they recorded it. They even look bored themselves on the cover photo! The one &amp; only pleasant surprise on here is &quot;I Walk Alone&quot;, which, amazingly, was sung by guitarist Bruce Kulick. If you're new to the music of Kiss, do yourself a favor and skip this one.
0767836286|4.0|Director:  Mark Pellington<BR>Cast:  Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis, Robert Gossett.<BR>Running Time:  117 minutes.<BR>Rated R for some bomb violence and language.<br />A gripping look at the horror that terroism can bring is very effective due to idea that it is a threat that can hit close to home.  The film opens with college professor Michael Faraday (played extremely well by Jeff Bridges) finding an child on the streets of his neighborhood with half his hand blown off due to a fireworks accident.  Faraday rushes the boy to the hospital, not knowing his identity or who his parents are.  He later finds out that the boy is the son of the all-American neighborrs Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack; in equal chilling performances that make will make your skin crawl) who have just moved across the street in on Arlington Road.<br />As Faraday gets to know the Lang family more intimately, he begins to suspect that they are not all that they claim and seem to be.  Faraday's girlfriend (Hope Davis) believes that he is just paranoid due to the tragic death of his wife, who was gunned down by a right-wing group who was suspected to be terrorists.  The professor is uncertain what to be believe--is he really just consumed with the Langs because of a haunted past, or is Oliver really a part of a horrific terrorist conspiracy that be lethal to his community?  <br />Director Mark Pellington creates an intense, riveting film that does not skip a beat--it unravels from the very start with the eerie introduction and the truth is revealed exceptionally well with a superb, twisted finale.  The cast does an great job, especially Robbins, who is stellar as the suspected mad-bomber.  The DVD has some nice features, including some nice commentary from Pellington and Bridges, as well as an alternative ending that is equally as surprising.  A fine, brainy thriller that is sure to shock and keep the audience on the edge of their toes.
B000089CJI|5.0|Being a newly converted fan of both Dntel and Death Cab For Cutie, I had to hear this side project of Ben Gibbard (Death Cab) and Jimmy Tamborello (Dntel). Gibbard's voice is beautiful over Tamborello's amazing tech-pop music. At first listen, I didn't really like the album. After listening to 'Such Great Heights' over and over again, it hit me. This album is soooooo original! I can't believe it isn't widely played. If you don't like 80's synths, then this album is not for you. For those synth pop-rockers out there; GET THIS NOW! However, Gibbard's voice should not be shuned for this colaboration. To really get the full effect of his sound, Death Cab For Cutie is right for the taking. All in all, great album, fun music, worth same-day delivery!
6305127697|5.0|Director:  Gregory Hoblit<BR>Cast:  Richard Gere, Edward Norton, Laura Linney, John Mahoney, Alre Woodard, Frances McDormand.<BR>Running Time:  130 minutes.<BR>Rated R for language, perverse sexual situations, and some violence.<br />Rarely is a psychological thriller/courtroom drama so intense, intellectual, and mind-blowing.  \\"Primal Fear\\" is an excellent adaptation of the William Diehl bestselling novel, using a stupendous cast, an equally riveting screenplay by Steve Shagan and Ann Biderman, and fine direction from virtually unknown Gregory Hoblit.  Red herrings and duplicitous plot twists are woven tightly into the film about a hotshot defense attorney named Martin Vail (Richard Gere) who goes looking for the limelight and finds it filled with shadows.<br />When a popular archBishop is brutally murdered in his illustrious home, a terrifyed young altar boy (in an exceptional, eerie role by newcomer Edward Norton--who would later become a star because of the film)is arrested as a suspect and held into custody.  Due to the magnitude of the case, Vail leeches onto it and decides to defend the young man.  Little does he know that he will uncover a viper's nest of corruption, pit him against a prosectuor (Laura Linney in a fine role) who happens to be his ex-lover, and hope to find the truth of a case that tests his will and win-at-all-costs attitude.<br />Gere is stupendous as the fame-hungry, confident lawyer, while Norton steals the film as he reveals the inner demons of the poor suspect.  \\"Primal Fear\\" is one of the most well-made thrillers of the 1990's and is a film that emphasizes what is right and wrong about our judicial system, questions the legitimacy of the courtroom, and taps into a fear of the psychological unknown.  A finale that will, if nothing else, shock you and make you think.  An absolutely great drama.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is an amazing CD! Pirates is one of my favorite movies and the music is what really makes it great. I am a huge fan of movie music and to me music can make or break a movie. In this case it really made it. I hadn't heard of Klaus Badelt before this movie but he did an amazing job. I wasn't surprised at all the see that it was overscored by Hans Zimmer. He is one of my favorite composers. All of his work is amazing. This music just brings the movie to life. What would the swordfight between Jack and Will be like without the awesome music? I highly recommend this CD if you liked the movie at all. It is wonderful!
B000099T2L|3.0|I've had this for about two months, and I've listened to this CD often. She co-wrote and co-produced most songs, and wrote the Interlude.<br />1.Crazy In Love featuring Jay-Z- I'm sick of this song, but I still think it's a pretty good song, it grew on me a bit.  8/10<br />2. Naughty Girl- I like this song. I stopped listening to the radio, becuase I noticed they were starting to play this song a lot and I couldn't stand hating this song. 10/10<br />3.Baby Boy featuring Sean Paul- I like this song but I think it would've been better if Sean Paul hadn't been in this, becuase you can't always understand what he is saying, but otherwise this song is good. 9/10<br />4. Hip Hop Star featuring Big Boi and Sleepy Brown- I actually really like this song, despite what people say about it being too heavy, blah blah blah etc. 9/10<br />5.Be With You- This song gets on my nerves becuase, although I respect her accent, it gets on my nerves becuase she's almost taking PRIDE in saying wichew. 6/10<br />6. Me, Myself, and I-This song is pretty good, althoguh sometimes it can get dull.  9/10<br />7. Yes- I hate this song. I think the message is good, but she is singing way too high for this song. 4/10<br />8. Signs featuring Missy Elliott- I like this song, it has a ctachy beat, and it got me to memorize the Zodiac signs in order! 10/10<br />9. Speechless- This song is really weird, and a bit too long (6 minutes)<br />10. That's How You Like It featuring Jay-Z-Ick, this could be a Britney Spears song.  2/10<br />11. The Closer I Get To You, a duet with Luther Vandross- She's not worthy of him. I don't really like Luther Vandross, but I respect him, and I know how talented he is for the type of music he does. So I like the song, but she shouldn't have had him in this. 8/10<br />12. Dangerously In Love 2- Good, but wasn't this on Survivor-Destiny's Child? Haha, I thoguht so! 8/10<br />13. Beyonce Interlude- A little poem to a boyfriend. Well.... 7/10<br />14. Gift From Virgo- I reallydon't like this song, I understand it's a \\"jazz song\\" but I still hate it. 3/10<br />15. Daddy- This is an ok song, but I don't have a Dad to sing this song to without me saying at least one nasty comment, so...no. But the song is pretty anyway. 7/10<br />109/150....... 3 stars
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This film is an invaluable look back at not only the Vietnam War era, but at the overall mindset relating to war in general that has been held by this country - and the world - in the 20th century, continuing, unfortunately, to this day.  McNamara is an enigmatic figure - as much as he appeared before the cameras and in the public eye during his tenure as Secretary of Defense under presidents Kennedy and Johnson, he's a very private man.  Even in the interviews that make up the bulk of this film, while he is refreshingly - and at times, shockingly - open about the events that transpired on his watch, and his thoughts, and the conversations he shared with those in high places, he remains pretty tight-lipped when Morris attempts to delve into subjects he is not willing to talk about.  Still and yet, this is a pretty amazing document - it very much deserved the Oscar it received as `best documentary' of 2003 - and, more importantly, it gives those who are too young to remember the times it depicts as sense of what it was like to live through them, to witness them.  It also gives McNamara the opportunity to set the record straight about some very important moments in history - and affords him, through the gift of hindsight and the wisdom that he has acquired with age and experience, to recognize the mistakes that were made, and grants us the chance to learn from them.<br />Included in the film are tape recorded conversations made in the Oval Office of the White House - conversations that most Americans have not had the opportunity to hear.  It shows how the decision-making process at the highest levels should work - the president, ultimately responsible, asks for and receives the counsel of a variety of experts on matters of national security.  Arguments occur - opinions are exchanged, oft-times heatedly and emotionally, between reasonable men.  But as McNamara observes, sometimes reason and good intentions are not enough - sometimes things work out for the best through pure chance and good luck.  He relates how, many years after the Cuban missile crisis, on a visit to Cuba, he learned during a conversation with Fidel Castro that, contrary to US intelligence at the time, there were already nuclear warheads in Cuba - the belief at the time was that the warheads were en route to the island aboard Russian ships, which instigated the blockade by the US.  Castro assured McNamara in this conversation that the warheads were there, and that he was prepared to advise the Soviets to use them, knowing full well the consequences - a world-wide nuclear conflagration that would have very likely destroyed the two superpower nations, and would have most assuredly left Cuba a smouldering piece of charcoal.  McNamara was horrified - as he is looking back, in the film, at several periods of his life, when he was involved in decisions that held the lives of thousands of people (military and civilians) in the balance.<br />His remembrances of the Vietnam War are both revealing and painful.  Similar to his meeting with Castro, he describes a meeting with (formerly North) Vietnamese officials, long after the war was over - it caused him to admit the errors in judgement and outlook that plagued and crippled US understanding of the situation in Southeast Asia at the time.  The US government viewed the conflict as a part of the Cold War - he sees now that the Vietnamese viewed it then, honestly, as a war against colonialism, that they saw the US as nothing more than replacements for the French, who had oppressed them for so long.<br />The former Secretary admits that he's not so naïve to think that war can be completely eliminated - he doesn't think humanity can manage to do that - but he expresses the hope that through honestly and humbly reviewing our history and admitting our mistakes and shortcomings, we can avoid blowing ourselves to bits.  While he asserts that the mistakes were not all made by him, he also states that by no means is he attempting to shirk responsibility for his actions and errors in judgement.  It's an honesty that is refreshing, even considering his past and how he was reviled and hated by the peace movement in the 60s and 70s - it's an honesty and openness that the current administration could (and should) take to heart...but somehow I don't see that happening.  If the White House has seen this film, they most likely determined from it that they should be even more secretive about their agenda and actions.  A pity.<br />This film is interesting, entertaining, and brilliantly presented - Philip Glass has written another perfect score with which to frame it.  It's something that should be required viewing in history classes - and indeed by all Americans.  `Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it' is a pretty tired old saw, but a valid one.to shirk responsibility for his actions and errors in judgement.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|I don't know if I'd  reccomend this for fans of 'Let Go' or not, but I will say this is a very good album.<br />1. Take Me Away- A great way to start the album, the chorus is really cool, but the song is too short. 9/10 Unwanted Part II<br />2. Together- This sort of takes a cue from &quot;Take Me Away&quot; becuase one of the verses goes like this. She jsut normally sings &quot;When I'm alone, I feel so much better but when I'm around you, I don't feeeel........ (then she screams out the chorus &quot;TOGETHER DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT AT ALL TOGETHER WE BUILT A WALL................&quot; 10/10 Losing Grip II<br />3. Don't Tell Me- The first single, I don't really like this song. I like the message but now I'm jsut sick of this song. 7/10 Complicated Part II<br />4. He Wasn't- This has a poppy feel but it's pretty good anyway. 9/10 Sk8er Boi Part II<br />5. How Does It Feel- I love this song, the guitar is good, and the lyrics are interesting. 10/10 Tomorrow Part II<br />6. My Happy Ending- I don't think this is a favorite but it's good. 8/10 Too Much To Ask Part II<br />7. Nobody's Home- A favorite. It's a really sad song and has a lot of emotion in it. 10/10 I'm With You Part II<br />8. Forgotten- This soing is really cool. It rocks out without getting too loud, and althoguh I like loud rock songs, you don't come across a song like this that often. 10/10 It doesn;'t sound Let Go-ish<br />9. Who Knows?- I hate this song! ICK ICK ICK! Doesn't really fit in.6/10 Mobile Part II<br />10. Fall To Pieces- A nice mid tempo ballad, I like. 10/10 Things I'll Never Say Part II<br />11. Freak Out-A good song, about not listening to anyone. Awesome great, stuperb song! 10/10 Nobody's Fool Part II<br />12. Slipped Away- I really can't describe it. It made me cry so bad. 10/10 Naked Part II
B000093BDX|5.0|The Beach Boys have had numerous &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilations, but this may be the best if you just want one CD.  Their biggest hits are included so that there is minimal &quot;fillers&quot;.  Honestly, it's a toss-up between this and &quot;20 Good Vibrations&quot;;  Personally, 30 songs may be a bit too much for the casual fan since twenty is just right.  However, if you want to fill-up a disc of songs then get this instead.  Obviously, many of these songs are less than three minutes, but the songs are still enjoyable.  Whenever you need to be in a happy mood during the summer, play this CD!  Have &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;!
B0000C8AQM|4.0|does anyone know the song that the black girl who thought she was fat sang when she showed Jack Black her skills?  I remember it was like &quot;chang chang&quot; something.. PLEASE email the name of it to me <BR>tictacoverdose@yahoo.com
B00003CXCT|1.0|Okay, I've given this product one star... without ever actually viewing it... but I know this movies better than anyone and I think they are excellent.  They are the pillars of sci/fi flicks, the \\"holy trilogy\\" as Kevin Smith calls them.  They are three of the finest flicks ever to be made.  However... I here that now you're only going to be able to get them on DVD with the special edition crap that George Lucus added in.  I pray this isn't true because the fact is that the added scenes ruin the films completely...  Maybe they are being true to Lucus's vision or whatever... but what gives him the right to go back and change his films?  At the time he made them I honestly doubt the studio would have given him full control to add in all these things... perhaps he didn't have the technology or he would have added them in... BUT... that's a good thing.  Did you know that in Jaws the shark was supposed to appear throughout the whole movie... only because of technological setbacks did they make the film so we only see the shark in the final battle... If Steve went back and added a computer animated Jaws into every seen (like lucus has done with all his new computer additions) then the movie would be horrible... it would lose everything that made it great.  The special effects in the original star wars are great... they might not look completely real... but since they're all congruent we don't notice... we get lost in the film.  With special editions we get cool model footage mixed with fake-looking computer animation.... CGI looks fake!!! No matter what it always will.. the old school effects looked real... why ruin them?  The whole idea offends me and if this is the only way we can see these flicks on DVD then I prolly won't even by them.  I'd rather watch them on VHS then support the special edditions... support giving directors the power to ruin their own films after the fact.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Wow! Avril really out did herself this time. &quot;Under My Skin&quot; is a great album that has realy cool songs. My favorite is &quot;Nobody's Home&quot;. But that's just my opinion. Check it out yourself!
