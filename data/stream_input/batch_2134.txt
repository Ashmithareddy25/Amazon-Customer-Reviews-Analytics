B000MV90IU|2.0|The sound quality was not good,the volume went up and down and it was very difficult to watch an excellent movie.<br /><br />I would not recommend this blu ray to anyone, I would have them look somewhere else for a better quality blu ray.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|Just OK.....a few well placed scares that made me jump. A creepy kid. I wish I would have Red Boxed it....would have been cheaper. Better than the second one. This is becoming a bad habit I can't seen to break!
0062082353|5.0|Amazing book, by an amazing patriot! Should be mandatory reading for every true American! These kinds of warriors are few and far between nowadays.
0061808121|5.0|Wanted to see how closely the movie stayed w/the book:  extremely well, considering how movies often don't meet the book's detail or message. The book I hadn't read, so now I know both movie and book are great.
B00425S1H8|5.0|If you're frustrated because you purchased a Serial to USB cable and can't get it to work ...this is the one to get. Why? Because inside the serial connector end is a chip used to make the needed data transmission format conversion from one connector to the other. You also have to install a driver to make this cable chip work correctly. This chip is produced by one company, Prolific, so they have a monopoly on it. As in many parts of the Asian world, there is no such thing as a copyright or copyright infringement laws ...ergo there are a lot of bogus chips made that simply won't work. You load the driver and connect your cable and nothing happens as it should because that cheapo cable you bought online or from WaldoMart has a bogus chip in it (yeah, but it was cheap). This is the cable recommended by Prolific on their website (one of two vendors).<br /><br />Simply put, this cable has a genuine Prolific chipset and a correct driver and it works. Period.
1451650728|4.0|I liked this book. Data back and all. It could of been done badly but this one was done well. I think most readers will find it to be an easy read.
B000MAH5O2|5.0|I really liked this book because it provides you with a balance of political debate, and the soft hearted story of Barack Obama. It taught me that politics not always comes from a book, but the history that makes oneself.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An absolutely riveting read, with beautiful writing and a wonderful, positive tone. The story starts slowly, but Mr. Martel's pleasantly humorous and warmly professional voice keeps the reader enlightened and entertained. This is a story of human perseverance, spirituality and love. With a big-assed Bengal tiger thrown in for good measure! Wonderful book.
0316044695|4.0|Another great book by another great American. I have loaned out this book, and everyone whose read it loves it!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I can't get enough I play every day I love this game it's so much fun to play thank you please update regularly
B005LAIISA|5.0|If you like to watch family and kids movie this is the one, and there is plenty of laughter and it will have you busting your side.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So life like and realistic I just love all the horses, especially Beauty, she really is a beautiful horse, I want a horse like her.
B005HSL626|4.0|An easy and fun game. I worried that i would not get it but i was able to play right away; My kids enjoy it.
B00AB0AR2U|3.0|This film series is just random. There'll probably another sequel. There are sone good fight scenes. Unlimited gun ammo. Alice and Jill look hot. Be interesting to see other reviews. More for fans of Underworld, Aeon Flux,.Sucker Punch, La Horde, Rec, V/H/S.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I am a former Marine and was looking to purchass a new Ka-Bar when I came across the BK2. I looked at some reviews on You Tube and decided to get it. It's beefy, heavy, and mean. The sheath is real nice and snaps it in to place when you send it home. I did add a strap at the bottom to keep it from flopping but other then that A+.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|Nothing better than being on a real play at Brodway, but with this DVD my family can remember the good feelings when we watch this play in NYC.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great app for various relaxing and soothing sounds. Not only do I use it at night to help me sleep, but I also use it when I study. These sounds put me in a relaxed yet aware state when awake and studying, thus reducing my stress level. When I use this app at night, I sleep soundly and awake up refreshed. It provides such a calming experience. There's often great updates to always keep improving the app. The new and best feature: You can create your own sound mixes from what's available! There's even more sounds online that you can download and use. Worth every penny and then some! You won't be sorry with this app.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. But, I always cry when everything is happening and at the end. I just love the dog and his whole story. One of the best movies I have purchased. Just love Richard Gere's acting. He as usual did not disappoint. Anyone who is an animal lover would enjoy this movie. But, have plenty of kleenex ready. You'll need them.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love the case - easy to put on - strap is perfect and it's lightweight.  Fits all my requirements.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This blu ray is incredible. The picture quality is stunning. The stories are captivating. David Attenborough is the perfect person to narrate this. Make sure you clear up your schedule because you will not want to stop watching, and you get a lot of segments to watch with this. Fans of planet earth, this is a must buy!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app because first of all its free even if it did cost money I would pay it I love this app
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|After all the hype I really expected a funny and smartly made movie. I did not like how much this disappointed me.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Worked for about 30 min. After that i was not able to start it. Any time I want to play and click on in, it goes right back home. Game would be nice if it was playable.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|It is great!  I love how easy it is to use the touchscreen with the case.  The only drawback is that sometimes it muffles voices to hear and be heard.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Downloaded this for my parents on lower end Android tablet runs without a hitch - they enjoy the challening levels and the easy game play.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I got this game for free and I am really enjoying it.  It's a great time waster.  It keeps me occupied for the times when I have nothing to do
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|If you like hidden object games and puzzles this game is great although I was a bit disappointed at its length but that could be because I was enjoying it so much.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Dont watch many cartoons and I guess now I understand why. It's amazing the quality and crispness of the animated characters.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|decently fun. it's simple but I think young girls will like it. play enough and you can get a zebra!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awesome if I were u I wood get it....  gettin so far in it and everything is free
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I will be reading more of this series.  I want to read the series to date before I see the movie.
B001FA0W5W|4.0|A personal and philosophical exploration of how to enjoy living in the world with less certainly. A serious work that does not take itself seriously.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|This album shows that lyrically, this artist has grown tremendously.  The lyrics of all of the songs,  tells of a woman in heartbreak, love, pain, growth, reconciliation, enduring struggles; this album has it all. The production is immaculately conceived and unforced.  I really have been enjoying the album at least 3 times a week since its release.  This first time I listened to it from beg. To end. I shed a tear.  This woman is Micheal Jackson BAD
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this app is great for killing time, in between commercials, and long car rides when you are not the driver.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas, she is only seven so there was a little learning curve involved, but my goodness have we had fun since we got the hang of it. Even when we didn't play strictly to the rules we have had a lot of fun and plenty of giggles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because you get to just play around with your horse and do competition. Which includes jumping. Great game!
B001NHNG64|5.0|I will be reading more of this series.  I want to read the series to date before I see the movie.
B008GFI4KY|5.0|great new album....maybe not as good as the first album, but better than the second.<br />I hope they can keep it going.....
B007REV4T8|1.0|Not only was the movie slightly boring (I checked my e-mail halfway through). But I'm forced to watch the movie ads every time I put the DVD in my player--I am unable to bypass them. Luckily, I won't have to watch these ads more than a few more times, as I probably won't be watching my DVD many more times--as I said before, Skyfall is a lackluster Bond movie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it passes time I suppose. so its ok. some games are good for building points to subsequently purchase other games in the app.
B0086700CM|3.0|I think this app is ok but the temple run 2 is better! So maybe just maybe you should get this app. :) I am 50% sure.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|this game starts off with four basic elements that you combine. once you get them all, the game ends, but you can recommend new elements. VERY FUN!!!!!
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|I rated this movie five star because it was action packed from almost the beginning and all the way through.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm fourteen and literally this book changed my life. It made me look at everything so differently sort of like Charlie. Starting high school was crazy and this book really helped me through those new experiences. Love this book so much!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great fun.  would be better if at the begining it told you what each bird did.  Like if they explode or go faster have bubbles.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|The previous reviews have mostly nailed this book on the head.  For starters, this book is a very dense read and can be done in a matter of 2-3 hours.  That being said, the book builds a strong foundation of what to eat, when to eat, and various diet recommendations that are critical for results--most of these recommendations come with research and studies behind them unlike many of the gimmicky diets out there.  As for the fitness, I was a competitive swimming up through college, but I've had recent difficulties sticking to a routine without a coach and teammates to hold me accountable. I've tried various routines, includes ones I would consider gimmicks (ie P90X), but I couldn't consistently work out in the confines of my apartment. BLS workouts are dense, and can be completed in 30-50 minutes--it's important to note that the workouts are very focused and as a result, easier to stay motivated.  Like the nutrition section, much of the fitness routine is backed with evidence of results and the science behind the results. Definitely consider this book if you are looking for a no nonsense strategy to achieving your health and fitness goals--I can tell you right now that it's worth far more than anything you'll see on an infomercial or in a magazine.
B00914JWSW|4.0|Great album for Streisand's fans.  This is her latest with many great new songs.  It is a keeper for sure.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|This book is great for young adults and adults alike. I love young romance an  believing in true love. Adding a wolf spin on it was amazing and kept the idea fresh. Especially since it not your typical werewolf stereotype. I look forward to reading the other two books to this series.
0596009208|4.0|I cant recommend the 'Head First' series of books enough. I was a new Computer Science student, starting a course which focused on Java for the first three years... I picked up this book, and after a brief niggle getting the environments set up on my computer (I have since learned that virtually every Computer Science book under the sun has some sort of technical teething issues!) I was immediately swept up in their visually interesting, and unique teaching style!<br /><br />Fast forward a few months, and I ripped it up at university! I felt like an absolute genius, as many of the Object Oriented concepts and JAva-specific knowledge had been drilled into my brain through practice and repetition! I got A+'s in my first three semesters of Computer Science, and it gave me an excellent foundation for the rest of the course!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Pretty good so far, have to work at figuring how things are suppose to  go and when your suppose to  do but all in all enjoying it. Highly recommend this game. Full version.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|i like all the different places to go.  still woud be better if game told you what each bird could do at the begining.  like do they explode, do they go faster if you touch them, do hav ehave bubbles that pick up objects?  still a lot of fun
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is one of the best I have read in a long time.  All of the characters are immediately brought to life, and are enduring to the end.  The entire story had me obsessed until the end. It is a great read and I am in the middle of purchasing the next in the series.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|This is one great action movie and there are a lot of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat :].
1451648537|5.0|Somewhat lengthy, but a great read. Isaacson delves into all the nooks of crannies of Steve Jobs' genius and mercurial personality. The result is a well-balances account of both.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This move actually starts looking as a pleasant entertaining film. However the language is so terrible, that we turned it off. Really annoyed to have to pay for this garbage. Do not waste your money.
B000MGB6M8|4.0|must have for your collection. Brand and Angeline at their best.  Minus all the scandal that surrounded it.  Loved it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|it was great reading friends and family loved it .  LOVED the characters and story line didnt want to put it down
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I love the Merlin shows. II only wish I did not have to wait so long for the USRegion 1.
B0076DELIG|4.0|A nice read.  I've read almost all Connelly's books enjoyed them all.  He has has had some better but a good read and always enjoy keeping up with Bosch.
B004UQPM4E|4.0|The movies themselves are as good as they ever were -- meaning Superman the Movie and Superman II are superb and the Donner cut is a fantastic view of what might have been.  I rather liked Superman Returns for what it was, an homage to the original two movies and Brandon Routh's performance really harkened back to Christopher Reeve.  Superman III and Superman IV are there just for completeness in my opinion as they were unwatchable in the theater so being on Blu-ray doesn't help.<br /><br />The one thing that annoyed me about the package I received was that it appeared to be a South American release.  There were funny symbols on the outer package and discs and all the writing was bilingual (English/Spanish).  None of this detracts from the viewing but it's rather distracting when you look at the package and my order said nothing about being intended for a foreign release.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've never read a Stephen King novel before.  I suppose because I don't care for his usual genre, but the title intrigued me.  I was not disappointed.  I found the structure fascinating and the characters well-drawn.  Knowing how things would turn out didn't make the plot any less interesting.  My only complaint was the way he handled the ending.  It was too convenient.  However, a large part of me wanted Sadie and Jake to make it back to the present.  I really didn't get the apocalypse setting of the present.  Unnecessary, frankly.<br /><br />My favorite moments were the Mayberry nods to the 50s and 60s.  And the actual idea of the past fighting not to be changed.
0345803485|1.0|This book totally through me off.  Everybody talking about how good it was....NOT!!!!!  I brought the trilogy for my vacation an I wanted to slice my throat. Every page was the same thing an you knew what was next......horrible.  Who ever like this book don't know good reading.....I went back to James Patterson....it would not allow me to post without a star rating.....it get zero stars from me!!!!!
0399226907|5.0|This book has it all.<br />It's simple, it teaches counting and it has a very cute story.<br />I can't tell how many times I read it to my children.<br />It also tells nature's most fascinating story about metamorphosis, which appeals to children and adults.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|IT WAS PRETTY DIRTY WHEN I GOT IT TOOK SEVERAL TIMES CLEANING IT TO GET IT TO STOP SKIPPING. ALMOST SENT IT BACK
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have never been this involved in a game before. My adrenaline be so pumped I have to stop and take a break! Totally addictive! I am very pleased with this game.
B00846F1YW|4.0|If you enjoy hidden object games but want a twist, the story line (dare I say plot) in Mysteryville2 provides that twist.  I haven't played the first Mysteryville - hidden object games usually aren't my thing, but as a FAOTD with good reviews I figured I would give it a try.<br /><br />I think a fair amount of effort went into the game, and while many of us are used to free &amp; $.99 apps, I don't think $3 is unreasonable if you are into this type of game.  Typically I am not, and probably wouldn't have paid $3 before, but I find myself looking forward to that rare 15 minutes of &quot;chill time&quot; with Mysteryville2 competing with whatever Kindle book I'm reading.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Loved it! worth buying we watched it a few times now. Funny, sad just a real cute movie enjoyed watching.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was good book the ending was unexpectable though still an ok book though now I can't wait to see the movie
0694003611|4.0|At the beginning it seems a little off to me, but then I read it again and again and I was caught in the rhythm.<br />It is simply what children need before they go to bed: to say good night to all the things they know and love.<br />The way it is written make you read it softly so it sounds almost like a lullaby.
B001CC7PPI|5.0|An enjoyable and of course suspense filled film from the master of the genre.  A two disc set which contains a load of extras on the second disc any film buff or Hitchcock fan must own this Universal Legacy Series edition.<br />The restoration of this is outstanding the film looks probably better than it ever has and I have seen quite a few versions of this on different formats over the years.  I'm sure the plots been explained enough in other reviews so I will just give MHO of this classic.  Jimmy Stewart gives a good performance, Grace Kelly as gorgeous as she ever was looks even better restored.  The true genius of this is how can you put suspense into a film where a man is confined to a wheelchair the whole film Hitch did.  There is a reason Hollywoods remade it twice (once with Christopher Reeves and reimagined as Disturbia) if you have never seen this see it if you have seen it this a beautiful edition and a fine way to find out more about this great film.
B000002KXO|5.0|yet another fleetwood mac comeback studio album.the album is a delightful collection of songs with a couple new hits mixed in.I reccomend this album for it's another excellent comeback by Fleetwood Mac.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I only got half-way through. Certainly not a bad book, just a bit predictable and syrupy for my taste. Price was great for Kindle
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is soooo fun and addictive and sooo colorful you should try it you wont regret it its like soooo much fun and the characters are adorable I cant find no negetave things to say about this game its just excellent :)
8866130907|5.0|Right size. Right feel. Red is great. Just what I wanted.The back pocket is a plus.This is great for traveling with me everywhere.
B007FY9ZWI|1.0|it will not play my songs and i cant give it bace this is no fare it will not even play kids bop for my kid
B002GHHHM4|1.0|When I ordered this, I thought  I was getting the movie along with the additional information about Bruce Lee and the making of the film. But it was just a documentary featuring Linda Lee. Not what I wanted at all! Buyers beware!!!
B004KZDV8E|5.0|Todo llego como se detallaba en la publicidad. Ademas el envio fue rapido y confiable. Recomendado al 100% gracias. t
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game.  It's fun addictive and challenging. Each new level brings more goals and faster runs. Zip lines, mine cars and scenery as promised.
B00008NRL8|5.0|One of the greatest &#34;atmosphere&#34; recordings I have. Sensual, relaxing, well-produced. I've bought copies for a few friends and they've also been thrilled to add this to their music collection. A &#34;can't-miss&#34;!
B00846F1YW|3.0|its a fun game and has great graphics but it crashes all the time.  a little disappointing...has a lot of bugs that need to be worked on.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Kevin Spacey shines as congressman Francis Underwood. A modern day Machiavelli. There is no good and evil in the world of politics, only power. Netflix hit a homerun with this series. An outstanding cast, script, and direction. David Fincher's brilliance shines through in this look at the interworkings of U.S. politics. With some dark twists and turns and a nuanced look at people's ambitions and fears, House of Cards stands stronger than its title'd metaphor. Robin Wright as Claire Underwood is excellent and at times more cunning than her husband. Kate Mara shows great promise as an up and coming reporter looking for a fresh scoop. The rest of the cast is also very strong. Not a weak character or element to the show. My wife and I devoured the entire season in less than a week. Highly recomend.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|A bit of a challenge and a decent time waster of a game. Beautiful graphics and sounds, and the game play overall is smooth. Just some small issues with some touch screen responses, but that is more likely due to the brand of the phone than the game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awesome, I love it so Much.<br />I recommend this if you like to take care of a horses
B009O07NDY|5.0|This is a wonderful soundtrack. I had to buy a second one because the first one was damaged in our old 5 CD player when it ate it. What I love about Howard Shore's music is his use of the musical themes from the Lord of the Rings sound tracks.
B0091REZMW|5.0|The best game I have Eva played in my life I guarantee that you will have an awesome time playing it and if you run out of energy all you do is wait and it will charge up.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I had only seen this movie once before I decided to buy it on DVD. I love it, there is a somewhat brutality to the storyline, which I compare to Nazi Germany and 1984 although I expect that this was the intention, The fight scenes are highly clever, this definitely comes from its origins as a graphic novel, they are a bit like Kick-Ass in a way, only darker and of course this was first. The film questions what it is to be human - freedom to love, freedom to speak etc - and leaves you wondering what it is you value the most in this sense, what could you give up and what would you fight for. The fact that we never find out the identity of V is so important. The fact that at the end, all the characters that were supposedly gone, all showed up meant that we questioned what was real and what was all V's creation. A beautiful, well created film that everyone should watch at least once. I loved it. The DVD itself was really good, great quality film, very crisp and real feeling.
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|There is nothing that I can say really she is my complete favourite singer and not only that being Jewish I am so proud of the help she has given to Israel and to her help to charities all over the world and also she is the kind of person that does not brag about anything
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Obviously different strokes for different folks, but there were some really good parts of the movie and some that left you scratching your head why the scene was left in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. You should totally buy this.It is fun.It is sort of like temple run.I am fully totally telling you to buy this It is awesome.Have fun!
B0067EKY9K|3.0|I thought this was a sweet, romantic, mildly entertaining film. Not too many boats rocked, no objectionable material, pretty good performances by Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor. No overwhelming conflict and you can figure from the beginning that yes,  boy will get girl.<br />I chose it because my husband fly fishes and I thought it would be a good date night movie for the two of us, but he ended up slightly bored by it. I would watch it again - by myself or with a girlfriend.
B009ZE27US|1.0|This game is the absolutely most horrible game EVER. It thought I was 47 and I'm not even 15 yet. Take my advice and DON'T get this app. I Wish I could give this game zero stars.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wish there were more choices for background and the backs of the cards.  I like this game<br />a lot
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Just read it. You won't be disappointed. I've been mourning finishing this book for a good 3 weeks. I felt like I was physically IN this world while reading it. I could hear music, smell popcorn, feel the moody ambience. I need to find more books like this!
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|This movie is a classic. It would have been nice had there been more extras, but the movie itself is always a winner.
B008476HBM|5.0|Read it!!!!!<br />If I can read this book(comming from a girl who doesn't read at all) you can read it.
1451696191|5.0|If you are looking for the book of all time, then this is it.  It was a great read!  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good read.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Fun game. I enjoyed the many levels and different puzzles. Story line and mystery kept it interesting<br />. Worked well on kindle fire HD.  Did not like many prompts to rate game<br /><br />I
B007J4T2G8|3.0|The character of Christian Grey is almost perfect. What's not to like.  The sex could be better. I lost my page. I mistakenly thought I'd found it because the description of the sex scene in two different parts of the book were so similar.  The overall writing is not very well done. The descriptions of pretty much everything except maybe Christian were bland.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I REALLY LIKED IT BUT..... AFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS IT STARTED OVER SO I LOST ALL OF MY MONEY AND CHARACTERS
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton is gotta see TV.  I would suggest seeing it from the beginning episode 1, season 1 till present.  I promise you will be glad you did.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A pleasant escape to lose yourself in!  Easy enjoyable read that's hard to put down once you get started.  Leaves you wanting more!
0307352145|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! It makes  you realize that you are indeed, ok! Too many times and places make you feel otherwise. I see my children as well.  I wish more of the world were quiet and thinking. I really dislike the new &#34;personality&#34; driven era that we are in.  If you are an introvert, you will appreciate her thoughts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great. I had first seen the movie and decided to buy the book. I loved it. Reminds me of 1984.....big brother.
1449410243|5.0|This book is very funny and if you are a cat owner you will catch your self launching out load plus starting to look at your cat very different. I have to admit though, the how to tell if your cat is gay was the funniest part, just random stupid humor that will put a smile on your face.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful story - keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Can't wait to watch season 3.  Would recommend to anyone that loves Masterpiece Theater.
030758836X|4.0|If I was as gifted a writer as Gillian Flynn I like to think that I would devote myself to creating works of art that were inspiring or uplifting and not create characters from the gutter with no redeeming characteristics in a story that has ultimately no meaning or value.  But hey, that's just me.  Four stars for Gone Girl, because Flynn has an amazing brain and the masterful ability to capture her observations on humans and their surroundings on paper, I admire her skill and have to bow to her talent. I can't give the book five stars because I save that for stories that I love, that I would recommend to others and that I will probably read over again, maybe more than once.<br /><br />The story kept my attention, which was good, but I thought the plot preposterous. It all hinged on Amy crossing every t and dotting every i successfully without erring, which in real life would probably never go as smoothly.  Even when she did screw up none of the supporting characters ever betray her. How convenient! I thought there wasn't enough back story on the husband...how did he get from Missouri to NYC? Where did he go to college, who was he before Amy?  He was kind of blank for being a protagonist.  The ending was so hopeless and evil and really, can someone be that sick and hide it until the end like that ?  I don't think so. So I found it, as I said, a little preposterous. I think there is a big difference between outsmarting someone, which was Amy's schtick all along, and being a psycho, evil creature, which she was at the end.  That's where Flynn lost me.
B00138EYG4|5.0|EVERYTHING CAME TOGETHER PERFECTLY ON THIS RELEASE. Halford's vocals are unhuman! I only wish they would have made it a double album while they had the formula right.
1451673442|1.0|This book tries very hard to give the reader something to put the teachings of the previous book &#34;The Secret&#34; into practice. Unfortunately, the author lacks the esoteric knowledge to really provide useful tools for doing so.<br /><br />This book was just a way to milk the success of its predecessor.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was left wanting to know more. I know watch the show ,because of this book. It deserves a 5 star rating.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Huge new world, great character development, and the plot has been gripping, would recomend for any reader of this genre
B0097AQEOK|3.0|The Japanese SHM-CD remasters of Joni's first 10 albums are the highest quality to have been released, so far. I bought all 10 when they came out in the Mini-LP format back in 2011. It's a shame that in Japan they have taken the initiative to improve on the previously-released HDCD masters, unlike in the USA. The same can be said for the Japanese remasters of XTC's CD catalog, also in Mini-LP format, which are superior to the American versions!

B0076DELIG|5.0|What can I say.  Another riveting Bosch novel by Michael Connelly.  Excellent plot and well-written; just what we've come to expect. I've been reading this series over a span of at least 10 years and have yet to be disappointed.

0553386794|5.0|I picked up a copy of this after hearing people rave about the show. Since I don't have HBO, I thought I'd give it a whirl. The book itself is massive.  The characters are surprisingly complicated for the genre...even the most deplorable of characters have redeeming qualities, and even the most noble ones have deficits. I found the plot to be completely and utterly unpredictable...also rare in this genre. It's a gritty, somewhat dark, and realistic world that the author has created...which makes it even more surprising when magic/fantasy elements appear.  It consists of multiple storylines weaving in and out, all related to each other but each completely independent.  This is a bit off putting at first, as I found just as I was \\"getting into\\" one characters storyline, I would be whisked away to another sub plot, and on and on. I also initially found it difficult to visualize characters, due in part to there just being SO MANY.  Even the most trivial of characters in this book seems to have a name, and the mental gymnastics it took to keep them all straight almost made me put the book down.  I'm used to \\"lazy\\" reading, and this forced you to be alert and engaged at all times.  Fortunatley, I kept at it...and when it finally all fell into place for me, I was left with a fascinating story unlike any I had ever read. While I'm a lazy reader, this is anything but lazy writing. The author NEVER takes the easy, convenient  way out of anything. There's magic in small doses...but it seems there's not quite enough to actually save anyone by \\"cheating\\" using it. In fact, main characters you have grown to appreciate will die.  I actually audibly uttered profanities in at least one scene, I had become so involved in the story.  I will also say that some characters storylines were far more interesting to me than others. Tyrion, Arya, and Jon's storylines were three of my favorites..and I'll admit that sometimes I grew impatient when I was plugging through a character storyline that maybe I didn't find so intriguing. Others may have different favorites, which is part of what makes this novel so impressive.  In short...brilliant storytelling, never gets lazy, complicated characters...but initially more casual readers may have a hard time getting into it. Stick with it, because it becomes a very rewarding read once everything clicks.at maybe I didn't find so intriguing.

B00005JN8Z|5.0|An EXCEPTIONALLY STELLAR PERFORMANCE by PETER USTINOV (age 28) as the deranged Emperor Nero and an exceptionally strong performance by LEO GENN, as Petronius, highlight this movie (both received best supporting actor nominations). Also starring a very handsome Robert Taylor and a very pretty Deborah Kerr. A love story between a renowned Roman general (Taylor) and a Christian (Kerr). Illuminating, both, Roman and early Christianity.<br />The special features on these dvds (there are 2-the movie is 3 hours long) are a treasure. The commentary gives such great insight into the actors, the characters of the movie in real time, and the times and life of both Rome and the budding Christian religion. This is one of the great Epic movies.<br />Again, I must emphasize the brilliant and nuanced performance of Peter Ustinov. One of the GREATEST.
B0049J0CTM|1.0|I need to make one thing clear before I begin this review: I am not a Pixar fan. In fact, after The Incredibles, my tolerance for the studio started heading downhill, especially in regards to films like Wall-E or Up. Granted, Ratatouille and Toy Story 3 picked up the pace a little bit, but upon seeing Cars 2, I was utterly appalled that the studio actually managed to make a film much, much worse than Wall-E of all films, and I almost gave up on them. Yes, I liked Brave...but I also saw the teaser trailer to Monsters University and it looks to me that the studio is back to making more crap for us in the near future.<br /><br />But believe it or not, the signs of their eventual downfall from grace wasn't marked by either Cars nor Wall-E; if anything, Finding Nemo pretty much confirmed for me that the studio was heading into a really bad direction. The only reason why that went over my head at the time was because the movie they made immediately after this--The Incredibles--was an awesome movie, and as it was essentially the studio's first big failure in my eyes, I was willing to pass it off as a mere bad egg. In retrospect though, I should have known better.<br /><br />This film essentially marked the very beginning of the studio's corruption into a corrosive mixture of sentimentality, a comedic meanstreak, sheer cynicism and heavy-handed propaganda all rolled into one. The best thing I can say about this film is the absence of the latter in this picture. Yeah, it's pretty too, but prettiness in a film can just as easily turn against itself as a negative instead. All pretty visuals in a film this nasty and this hateful can do is ultimately invite others to sit back and embrace the film for all it has to offer: Carefully calculated sentimentality, trite jokes, and unlikable characters. The visuals do not enhance the quality of the film; it only contributes to the manipulations and the brainwashing.<br /><br />And frankly, Nemo got what was coming to him. He deliberately disobeyed his father and swam out into the open ocean to touch the boat! I don't care if he was a kid; he got what was coming to him. And there's no possible way I can side with his father, Marlon either because the guy is portrayed as being so anal retentive that he became both annoying and unbearable. Yes, I know; he lost his mate during the film's prologue. But that doesn't excuse the way the film portrays him; as an obsessive-controlling shrew who was clearly in the wrong from the very beginning. And I really hated the jokes surrounding Dory and Darla (the antagonist); those jokes were not funny; they were nasty and mean-spirited. Dory's got short term memory loss, which is a serious medical disorder; Darla is a loud, ugly, stupid little girl who can't take a hint after the first time she shook her fish in a bag. Both cases played entirely for laughs.<br /><br />The only remotely likable character in that film is Gill (the leader of the fish tank) because his plight is totally understandable as well as the reasons why he needed Nemo to sabotage the tank as part of their escape plan (granted, there should be some serious ecological repurcussions for them for doing so, but in a better movie, I'd let it slide). Everyone else in this film's either extrutiatingly annoying or just plain pointless; before anybody mentions Bruce the Shark and his Fish annoynmous group, Friz Freleng did it better with the short film, Birds Anonymous, and it was in better taste as well.<br /><br />And the rest of the story is every bit as predictable as it is melodramatic and weepily sentimental. Nemo directly and deliberately disobeys his father and gets kidnapped as a result; Marlon overcomes many a ''hardship'' along the way and ''grows'' into a ''better'' father figure upon his reunion with his son; but first, we needed two fake outs in which the film expects us to believe that Nemo's either dead or dying, the second one followng an arbitrary climax. That's the entire film; a formulaic story that substitutes real suspense or character depth in favor of corrosive sentimentality.<br /><br />Frankly, I am appalled with this film. I am appalled with Pixar. I am appalled with Andrew Stanton. I am appalled of the knowledge that we're going to get a sequel to this. If you still bow down and worship this film as a great work of art, then nothing I say from this point forward is going to matter. This film is without any redeeming virtues. Not a single, solitary one (sorry, but Gill's character is completely irrelevant compared to everything else that is wrong with this movie).<br /><br />Seriously, compared to the bottom 4 Pixar films, this is easily number 3; not as bad as Cars 2 or Wall-E, but even worse than Up. Up has the benefit of being a potentially decent--albeit sentimental 30 minute short fillm bloated to almost 2 hours in length. Finding Nemo sucked the moment Nemo rebelled and never recovered.<br /><br />PS: As for why Wall-E and Cars 2 are worse? Because at least Finding Nemo had the common courtesy of not being a propaganda flick like Wall-E (yeah, it toned down on the comedy, but it instead became a joyless ideological flick bent on brainwashing young children, both traits I think makes it worse). Cars 2, on the other hand, just has so much intellectually and morally wrong with it...and it stars Larry the Cable Guy!
B000T433CO|5.0|This is such a cute, sweet romantic story.  They did a nice job with the movie.  It is very enjoyable to watch.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This creates the baseline for a new series, and there are a number of interesting aspects to the characters. The drama of the storyline could be a little tighter, but the potential for this series keeps growing.

B007HACDLK|5.0|The worst part of finishing a Vince Flynn book is the start of the waiting for the next saga to begin.
B000059TPN|4.0|It goes without saying that Michael Bay is one of the most infamous filmmakers working today. But did you know he actually made a genuinely good--or at least likable movie--at one point in time? In comes his second directorial effort, and his follow-up to Bad Boys. It makes for a fun popcorn flick, and it's actually not completely brainless. Just...somewhat brainless. Then again, I'd rather watch a braindead action film than a braindead comedy, or for that matter, a braindead drama.<br /><br />First honors goes to Quentin Tarantino who was uncredited for the story idea behind The Rock. I say story idea because if I never said Tarantino had any involvment in the film, you never would have guessed. The script bares little resemblance to anything Tarantino-related, save, possibly, in the characterizations of two of our leading men: Sean Connery, who plays a former convict of Alcatraz (and whose backstory refers strongly to Connery's days as James Bond), and Nicolas Cage as an FBI scientist who uses rather amusing euphanisms in place of profanity (the most infamous one being Zeus's Bu2+h01e). And indeed, they both play their roles rather well, as does Ed Harris as a Vietnam War Hero who, in the midst of a vendetta against the Government that wronged the men that died under his command, has a delusional lapse of judgment and assembles a team of incredibly violent mercenaries to hold the entire city of San Francisco hostage with the threat of dispensing an incredibly lethal gas from Alcatraz, effectively wiping out the entire population. He is shown the err of his ways, redirects one of the remaining missiles into the Pacific Ocean, and dies attempting to disassemble his team.<br /><br />And while it bares very little resemblance to a Tarantino script, it definitely bares resemblance to a Michael Bay film--only filtered to remove most of the vulgarity and include a bit more thought and care into the characters themselves. That means no racist stereotypes; no annoying ultra liberal parents, and no Shia LaBeouf in the middle of a kittencalendarkittencalenderkittencalender mental breakdown that otherwise made a complete fool out of himself. And hey? Plenty of fun action set pieces all around that still hold up today.<br /><br />Where I must draw the line, however, is in the script. It was clear this was Michael Bay's favorite project and he was constantly trying to recapture the plot and the charm of this picture in the Transformers movies--and to a lesser extent, Armageddon. The thing is, however, that aside from the fact that he essentially tired this plot thread to death, one must really question quite a few scenes present in the film and the logic behind them. For example, why are all the military experts so utterly incompetent in this picture? Why did Ed Harris and his men have the entire infiltration squadron--sent in by their superiors in the CIA and FBI into what was obviously a deathtrap--killed save for Cage and Connery, and then simply through the remaining two in the cells? And aren't pilots trained to not fire their missiles until they were commanded to do so? Clearly, Michael Bay wanted to end the movie with a massive explosion that should have killed Cage (and yet he still managed to use as a plot device to fool the FBI and CIA directors into thinking that Connery was vaporized by the explosion...imbeciles).<br /><br />Truth is, the film is the smartest script Michael Bay had ever directed--and perhaps the smartest he will ever direct. But it's still a Michael Bay film. I enjoyed it. You might not. Take it for what you will. A 5 out of 10 for those who simply can't check their brain at the door. A 7 out of 10 for those who can--at least for this picture.  I'm in the latter category, and that means that translates to a 4 out of 5.
6305508550|5.0|The magic of Office Space is the not only the never-ending string of hilarious moments from the two Bob's to the red stapler, but is becoming almost a documentary.  What I mean by that is the comedic moments are eerily similar to real life Corporate America, which makes it even more hilarious.  I know higher-ups in Corporate America must have seen this movie and yet they don't think they are like it.    The cast was great and I will be interested to see where this movies stands 10 years from now in the ranks of comedies (and maybe even documentaries).  Join the discussion on funniest real life moments like TPS reports from ADP.    [...]
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|While it was a bit of a shock that all the same cast came over to the 2nd season in an all new setting, after the first couple episodes I was hooked in again and impressed. Some of the best writing, acting and production on TV. While I normally don't like horror (and this is very disturbing subject matter) it is expertly handled and the actors bring it to life.

1616550414|5.0|Exactly what i wanted, thank you. I never thought life could ever get this good. All my dreams are now fulfilled.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|What has drawn you to this movie?  Well it's the flight gone to hell and the extraordinary action that takes place as a pilot does something that not one other pilot is later able to duplicate in a simulator.  Yes, this pilot is just that good, as is the knuckle-whitening action of this part of the movie.  5 stars for the flight scenes.  This is what had me purchasing the movie instead of just renting it or getting it from the library.  I fully expected that I'd be watching this movie again in the future.<br /><br />What we aren't told just from watching the trailer is that more than the flight, this movie is about a man with a serious alcohol addiction and his ability, for the most part, to function while drunk.  As a matter of fact, this aspect is the bulk of the movie.  Denzel Washington once again does an incredible job and not just because he stumbles around drunk on occasion.  We get to know a man who is a very flawed hero as we witness his complete denial about his problem,  Much of the movie has you  disgusted with this person, amazed at the quantity he drinks as well as hopeful that he'll beat his addiction.  It's difficult to watch him mess up time and time again as different people in his life try to help him.  5 stars for the acting.<br /><br />But it's a very difficult movie to sit through.  Worth it?  Yes.  Could I have said that 3/4 of the way through the movie?  No.  The ending isn't what I expected, but we do get some closure and I liked the movie more because of it.  Would I want to watch it a second time a few months from now?  I don't believe so.  And for that reason alone, I give it less stars.  I suggest renting it before deciding to buy it.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|This is a great movie  we loved it .This was a gift for my boyfriend  and he was happy to get it.The disk  worked great thanks

B0028KF4M4|3.0|its so great to be able to watch episodes for such a cheap price! but it didnt stream too good...but it wont keep me from buying more episodes..
B00BESM14U|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie and it began well.  Ultimately, it falls woefully short of the classic coming of age teen drama.  The wooden acting fails to reach the true depths of these potential characters and their inner torments.  Instead comes off as an indistinct vanilla shadow of this generation and genre.  Watch Garden State or Breakfast Club, you will be much more satisfied.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I read the books and watched the movies at the theater. I have pre-ordered BD Pt.2 and this will complete my collection of the Twilight Series. I am very happy with it and found it emotionally attaching. It was something extremely different from the usual vampire/wolfman type of movies I tend to watch. I loved that it was different. It was a different approach to the usual same old thing. So the vampires sparkle and that is why they don't come out in the sun. And the Indian clan weren't really werewolves merely people that turned into wolves when vampires threatened human life. A family of vampires trying to live among the humans without taking human lives was the best change from the usual take. I just love the love story and the imagination that went behind the making of the Twilight Saga. I have enjoyed following along with all the fans and I would love for Stephenie Meyer to continue with Twilight but one can only hope and be patient that she may. For those who have followed with the books, you will not be disappointed. I will not give away too much information like others have. I will leave it to you to discover for yourselves.

B0099Y2MYK|1.0|Just finished watching season three and sadly, that was my last season.  If killing off two of the most beloved characters was deemed necessary, then this series is done.  Happily, we'll always have seasons one and two.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|I purchased this to hold me over until more Miracast devices hit the market. The adapter works perfectly, and unlike the last adapter I had for the Galaxy Nexus this one doesn't cut out. I am very pleased with this product, and I would recommend it to anyone with a Nexus 4.

B003TJ4YU6|5.0|Bought this for my father who was 32 years old when it aired. He always remembered this particular show because, being a man who grew up in Puerto Rico, he couldn't understand what was wrong with the American girls who were going crazy for these guys. He would learn later on of course. But at 81 it was something that he mentioned to me of his memories and I looked for it, found it and got it for him. Hes is very happy with it.
B00A2IUDO8|4.0|Amazon's media download services are fantastic! I've used it for PC softward, music and now movies. This title was my first attempt via Sony's Play Station 3. After spending around 15 minutes learning UI navigation, it was easy to purchase and download this title to my PS3 library.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I bought this for my Synology DS1512+ Diskstation as many others did. I didn't run the DS for long without it so I can't speak to the performance boost, but it was a breezy install and it appears to be working handily.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|A fun little game. Simple, easy to start and stop, so it makes a good time occupier while waiting for someone. Having a little easier control over the sound would be nice. For the price, you cannot go wrong. A nice reminder of Middle Command.
B000002W9Q|5.0|The CD is worth it, my husband loves it. He listens to it all the time. Brings back alot of memorys.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|We saw this at the drive in when it first came out.  I wasn't too into it due to not being able to actually watch it.  Bought it on DVD and the whole family enjoys it.  Brings to life the ghoulish favorites I grew up and now am able to share with my 4 year old.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|I always like the Jack Reacher books, even those that are a little disappointing. Gone Tomorrow is no different. Overall I liked the book a great deal, always enjoying the powers of reasoning and intelligence that Jack brings to find solutions to problems. Of course, he can get down and dirty and kick serious butt when he needs to, always coming out on top and living to fight another day.<br /><br />One thing that bothered me about this 13th book in the series is the change in vocabulary that Jack supposedly uses. It feels like Lee Child switched editors to one who told him that he had to beef up the big words.  All of the sudden Jack is saying sentences like this one:  \\"She spoke politely, appealingly, a little submissively, even diffidently, like a supplicant.\\" or this one:  \\"She got no further than an inchoate little th sound. A voiced dental fricative.\\" Huh? That's not the Jack of the previous 12 books.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me is the scene in the Four Seasons' business center where he views the DVD sent to him from the bad guy, all while talking to the bad guy on a cell phone. There are a couple other people in the business center, none of whom apparently see the ghastly images nor hear him repeatedly telling the bad guy that he/she is a dead man/woman. I've been in hotel & motel business centers across this country, and I've never been in one where that could happen.<br /><br />One last thing that bothered me is the anti-climactic, unsatisfying ending. Although it is probably precisely what would have happened in real life, after you invest a couple days of reading into a book, you'd like to have all the secrets revealed.<br /><br />In spite of these things, I did enjoy the book and would recommend it. I love developing lasting relationships with characters in a long series of books, and the Reacher series is an outstanding one.

B007FRHZ4A|4.0|My four year old Son is crazy about Angry Birds...he eats, sleeps, breathes, and lives for Angry Birds. And while he really had no interest in playing an Angry Birds game with actual rules, he sure did love the Pig and Bird figures, as well as the little blocks that you can use to build structures to hide the Pigs in. The game comes with a Red Space Bird, The Ice Bird, a Meteorite, and three Pigs, one of whom has a clear space helmet. This toy is currently going for nine bucks, which is a steal. Your little Angry Birds fan will love it!

B000021Y7X|5.0|This live performance by the Talking Heads is a landmark in rock film history. Terrific rhythms underlie the songs, and the addition of the dancing back-up singers brings it to an even higher level. David Byrne is WAY out there as a performer, and I love how he conceives the performance as adding layers and musicians, starting by playing solo acoustic guitar to a percussion tape on a boom box he brings onto the bare stage with him.<br /><br />Intensely singable- Byrne loves colloquialisms and figures of speech as his lyrics. I would say  &#34;strange but not a stranger&#34; is a good description of this creative powerhouse.

B009VL299E|2.0|This is not about the music or the choice of songs.<br /><br />What I find annoying about this DVD is the way it is captured.<br /><br />The director thinks he has to change angle every two seconds just to prove how dynamic the show is.<br />Same with the shots from the crowd all through the show. I think I saw half of the audience in irrelevant close-ups all through the DVD.<br /><br />Stick to te show and eventually throw in some crowd shots in between songs !!<br /><br />While in Canada Metallica had better contacted Pierre an François Lamoureux to register the show.<br />Their registration of Tragically Hip ( That Night In Toronto) or Joe Satriani( Satchurated) show how it has to be done !!

0756405890|5.0|This book is fantastic. I can't believe people keep writing such bad reviews about how boring it is and not worth reading. Just because there isn't some giant fight or catastrophe every two pages doesn't make it boring. The book is about a man's life, there are going to be some more calm instances. One part of this novel that makes it worth reading is the language and imagery. Rothfuss is a masterful writer who makes words flow like I have never read; he can be witty, clever, and funny, but also cruel and harsh. Kvothe's story is one, not about a boy genius who can do anything better than anyone, but of a man who is incredibly gifted but also arrogant. If you enjoy a good story and eloquent writing than TNOTW is perfect for you.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|GASP! I know, I actually bought this book. Well, not right away. I’d been seeing talk about this for at least six months on Twitter, for crying out loud – six months. This is a long time for people to be talking about a book. It had to be good, or something. Then, a little research took place. People were calling it a ‘porn’ book, a partly badly written book, just a book about sex, sex and more sex. This started putting me off, not that I have anything against sex in books as in some, if not most, it has its place. So, I shelved this (my brain has compartments, of course), for another time. Still, as yet more time went on, so did the talk. I eventually gave in about 3 weeks ago and promptly bought the first one on the Kindle, which wasn't cheap, but as long as it wasn't awful, that was okay - I was just too damn curious by then. I had to see what all the hype was about, and of course, I like to form my own opinions.<br /><br />With Kindle in hand, I started. I tried ever so hard to keep what I’d read about Fifty Shades of Grey as far away from my mind as possible. But, it was hard for over half the book due to certain lines, things like: I bite my lip/I bit my lip/Stop biting your lip/Anastasia, stop biting your lip/Holly cow/Holy crap/I feel it down there/It moves me down there/He cocks his head/He cocked his head/He cocks his head some more/His long finger/His long finger/More long finger, and you get the gist of it.<br /><br />Yes! We get it, he has long fingers, he likes to cock his head, in fact, he does it so many times, I’m surprised he doesn’t get a cramp and stays that way permanently, and if Anastasia (Ana) bites her lip anymore, it’s going to darn well fall off! Honestly, after Ana seeing the Red Room of Pain and naming certain items, she describes her private parts as down there? GROWL. Oops, shouty caps! Sorry, couldn't resist - I get it from the book. There are different ways of describing the same thing, there really wasn't any need for so much repetition. However, I eventually brushed this aside, got used to it (sort of) and read the story. I didn’t want to like it - I really didn’t. In fact, I had told a few friends not to waste their money as I’d give them a really short synopsis! I was adamant that I would not read past book one, and when I was about 75% in, I said as much. Yet, horror of horrors, I fell in love with the story, I couldn’t help it - it hit me like a ton of bricks. I admit it, I'm a hopeless romantic! It is a love story, a wonderful romance – it really is, only with a twist in the form of ‘kinkiness’ and ‘sensuality’. Which love story doesn’t have some sort of something? Granted, I haven’t read one such as Fifty Shades before where all sorts of implements are used as they do with BDSM, where contracts need to be signed stipulating what will be done and what won't, including a NDA (Non-disclosure Agreement). Well, I’m no prude, but reading about some of these implements left me somewhat open-mouthed, and if it wasn’t winter right now, I’d have surely swallowed a few errant flies. I never knew half this 'stuff' even existed! I must say, though, that the book isn't just about them doing 'it', although they do it - a lot - they're young and full of stamina I suppose *snicker*. It's about Christian overcoming the demons in his past, gradually, his dominance and the hold it has on him. He's controlling - to the extreme. His life's about to change in more ways than one, because from the get-go Christian is captivated by Anastasia. But, this story is also about Ana, her mother, her step-dads, and about her helping Christian reach a point in his life where he accepts that he does have a heart although she wasn't intentionally doing anything special at all to elicit changes in him - she was just being Ana. Sometimes, what or who has been missing your whole life, just casually or clumsily falls into it.<br /><br />I love the main characters, Christian and Anastasia. He has a dark past, it’s why he is the way he is, and you will understand this when, or if, you read the book. It all comes together, and I found myself feeling extremely sorry for him. I couldn't help it. It just was. I like Christian, because right from the beginning, and although he comes across as this tough, take-no-prisoners kind of guy, he adores Ana. He has always given her an 'out' despite his demands, rules and regulations. The ball has always been in her court. She is never at a disadvantage, is totally in charge of what she will or will not allow, and has been told by Christian that should she ever not want to do something, or wishes to simply not even attempt it at first, she just needs to say so. She's never kept locked up, or treated like a slave either. As for the rest of the characters in this book, they are all likable with the exception of one or two, of course. Towards the end of the book, there were two scenes of which one, for me, was gross and it had nothing to do with said implements, and the other was just harsh. But, as I’m nearly done with book two, the talk they have in the beginning made me think, he is right, why didn't she stop it? Ana could have prevented what took place. She had a choice, yet failed to safe-word, then promptly left him. Granted, there is only so much people can take – play with fire, and you will get burnt. Christian has surmountable issues, but then he was made a submissive at the age of 15 by his mother’s best friend, so this is what he knows, it's his existence. We all have baggage of some sort, Christian has closets full.<br /><br />I don’t want to start writing about every little detail in this book as it’s been done countless times in every single review, but I will say that it shocked me in the beginning, turned my mind around, made me feel for Christian, going as far as sympathising with him. Boy, his self-esteem can't go any lower. But again, I don't blame him. I really like Ana, too. She's a strong-minded young woman and although she comes across as timid at times, she doesn’t really take much crap from him, or anyone else for that matter, and can make her own decisions. I so got into this story, I have now gone and bought all three paperbacks. Gorgeous covers, I think. One element throughout the book that I always enjoyed (and still am) are the e-mails between them. Nicely done and fun.<br /><br />One more thing I wanted to mention, and this was in regard to Twilight… I don’t get why a lot of reviews compared this to that series. I have read Twilight, own it, have watched the movies, own them, but nothing makes me compare one to the other. Go figure. Regardless, I gave in and I’m glad I did. So far, I’m thoroughly enjoying the second book, Fifty Shades Darker, and am nearly done. I just hope book three is not a whole lot of waffling for the sake of filling up an extra book.<br /><br />As I didn’t just like this book, but actually really liked it, I’ve given it 4 stars. Yes, the writing could in parts have been better, but it is still nicely written in others. Ultimately, these are only my thoughts. Laters, baby.  Another one of those catchy sayings in the book - amazing that the more one tries not to say it, it's what keeps coming out of ones mouth!asia.

B00A1XIXM8|5.0|\\"But maybe I'll inch closer to the source / When I find true north.\\"<br /><br />Prior to this album's release in 2012, Brett Gurewitz had commented, while praising Pennywise's surprising release of \\"All or Nothing\\", that he was inspired to create \\"Another No Control\\" for his own band & Epitaph founding mainstay, Bad Religion.<br /><br />Now, let's be realistic here: any Bad Religion fan who read this, was probably full of doubt. You do not just drop that album name in a casual conversation without discussing how influential it was & still is. The most recent attempt at this kind of classical throwback was also the ambitiously uneven & faux old-school New Maps of Hell, so a bit of trepidation was warranted.<br /><br />For once, it wasn't.<br /><br />The album cover gives a clear indication that the band wasn't ***ing about in the effort behind this album as more old-school sounding: purposely minimalistic & 80's punk black & white w/ simple photography cutouts & edits worthy of an MS Paint session or a dumping of dollars in change at a Kinkos. The entire booklet is also minimal, & the grey & monochrome theme give major signals of this releases primary classical BR influences: 1990's \\"Generator\\", 1994's \\"Stranger than Fiction\\", & to a lesser extent, 1996's \\"The Gray Race\\".<br /><br />The lead single, \\"*** You\\" is almost a complete meta joke on Bad Religion's own intellectual lyrics (\\"You can even get cerebral if you want to\\" & \\"Sometimes it takes no thought at all / The easiest thing to do / Is say *** you\\"), wrapped up in a more aggressive & straight forward punk song, with just the right amount of multi-syllabic Graffin verse play & the staple \\"Ozzin Ahhs\\". Following behind is also another interesting, refreshingly more rock oriented number called \\"Dharma and the Bomb\\" featuring...Brett Gurewitz on lead vocals? When did new Bad Religion ever do that?<br /><br />The brilliant moments on this album are almost too numerous to list: the sudden budget vocal panning whileBrooks hammers away on the drums in the intro to \\"My Head is Full of Ghosts\\", the aggressive old-school snare intro & completely infectious sing along chorus in \\"Nothing to Dismay\\", the surprising rhythm build-up in the verses of \\"Popular Consensus\\", the almost Generator sense of exploration in crunching guitars in \\"Crisis Time\\", the quick No Control start to \\"In Their Hearts is Right\\" & a pleasing Against the Grain feel to the slowed down / sped up chorus.<br /><br />Even after the slower respite from \\"Hello Cruel World\\", the urgent, more hardcore \\"Vanity\\" kicks the album right back into gear, sounding like a far better version of \\"Murder\\" from NMOH. The faster songs here on True North have a sense of organic speed & urgency that we haven't really heard in full since \\"Supersonic\\" opened up Process of Belief. That isn't to demean the last 3 albums faster material, nor the albums themselves, but it's far more effective here.<br /><br />I hate to bring up the concept of a \\"spirit\\" or \\"geist\\" with an album that implies \\"my head is full of ghosts\\" already, but despite musical, technical & rational analysis, there's a certain vague charm found on True North that isn't found on the genre tweaking & folk / arena rock forays of the band's last few albums (Dissent of Man, New Maps of Hell or The Empire Strikes First, respectively).<br /><br />Every song here, even the more briefer than usual closing track \\"Changing Tide\\", manages to fit together cohesively, neither overstaying their welcome or just being underwhelmingly brief, with all 16 tracks clocking in at a much leaner 35 total mins.<br /><br />Nothing is sacrificed for the runtime: the solos are solid, efficient (\\"no solos beyond 16 bars\\" old school rules). Graffin's vocals are as perfectly suited to this band as usual, keeping up with the higher speed & syncopation of this album's compositions. The guitar trio of Hetson, Baker, & Gurewitz keep driving the energy forward with the riffs & provide a convincing argumentthat this album might the best thing the band has recorded since acquiring 3 guitarists. Rounding up the rhythm section is Wackerman conducting the speed for the rest of the band behind the drums, & Bentley glueing it all together on the bass.<br /><br />Lyrically, both Brett & Greg are on par with one another, & help focus the album's themes (the irrationality of politics & corporate personhood, narcissism,illusions of security brought upon our own delusions, to name only a few brought up) into a more personalized way to the listener, even going far more existentialist on tracks like \\"The Island\\" & \\"Hello Cruel World\\".<br /><br />You even get the sense that finding the title of the album itself, True North, is almost a literal description of what the band is doing here: delving into their classical sound as a means to illuminate a clearer way to future albums, after the uncertainty of their most recent output.<br /><br />But I digress; while True North is not the promised \\"sequel\\" to 1989's No Control, it comes pretty damn close. If anything, it feels much more like a sequel to either Process of Belief or Stranger Than Fiction, & while I still enjoy & appreciate their 2004 to 2010 output, this album is on another level altogether, & deserves to be considered a classic album in it's own right.<br /><br />With the band inching closer to the source, True North is truly a blast.<br /><br />It took 3 albums (The Empire Strikes First, New Maps of Hell, & The Dissent of Man) of varying experimentation, some sounding more arena-rock, classic, or folk than others, but the band's renewed focus on their past classical albums (Suffer, No Control, Against the Grain, & Generator) to make newer material for the present is evident, & their effort pays off in spades.<br /><br />This is easily their best album since Process of Belief, & their fastest album since Against the Grain.  It took them 3 albums to get there, but True North expands upon the mixture of classic & experimentalfound in Process, & has the band playing just the right kind of audio elixir to keep themselves & their fanbase going.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|i love sherlock holmes and this is a great addition to my collection. would recommend it to all fans to get
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is awesome.  I burned an hour without even realizing it trying to beat my best time.  The controls are simplistic yet fluid, and the touch is accurate enough to enable matching of cubes from opposite ends of the playing field.
1400052181|5.0|This is a great book~  It is interesting and well written.  I have a science background and found the history and ethical progression of history in the context of this story quite intriguing.  Friends in the field of social work found it interesting for its description of one's medical rights and how that has changed.  Overall, a great conversation starter, has historically relevant information, and is very educational across fields!  I bought copies for many family members for Christmas!  Oh, and it is very easy to read-- meaning, it is user friendly-- it doesn't require any amount of training or experience in a particular discipline to be gripping!

All those people giving this product a great review must be watching on an antique square screen TV. Come on studio anamorphic, anamorphic, anamorphic!!!
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Ok, we should start off with the fact that I've been around since Dr. No hit the screen and I have seen them all, read all the original Fleming books and have most of the movies on DVD.<br /><br />I have been disappointed in David Craig and the tact the Bond movies have taken since the producer Broccoli died. I figured the only thing left for them to do to completely ruin the Bond saga was to have him walk off into the sunset with some guy.<br /><br />Well that didn't happen. Although the plot may have been more at home in a Batman movie it was nevertheless; entertaining and when they trotted out the Aston Martin DB5 and cranked up the old theme song, if I had been in a theater, I would have stood up and cheered.<br /><br />Ok, it's not the 50s anymore. Too bad. All you kids missed a cool decade. I guess I'm going to have to have more than one Bond. The old one and I will get together on Christmas day (a tradition I started after my wife died) and the dogs and I  play off our favorites \\"Do you expect me to talk? No Mr. Bond I expect you to die.\\"<br /><br />The James Bond of my youth is dead. Long live James Bond. At least the new one, this time, was entertaining.I'm going to go throw a dinner in the microwave and watch it again.--Noel McGaughey
B009EEFTMC|5.0|You play the game just as it says to. The game is so simple to play. You select matching cubes among the cubes that make up the body of the game you are playing. You can select cubes from any side that matches another any where else at all. They are not hard to find matches. It's simply addirctive. It gets more challenging as you go but not so much that you don't want to play. I give up rather easily compared to most adults. If that helps.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|After reading the 1st book which I purchased for my Kindle, I hesitated about 2 months before purchasing this one.  Will not waste my money or time on the 3rd.  There is no story line except the sex part which is very overdone.  It certainly is fiction and one can draw their own conclusions on the ending.  There are much better books, authors I will read with my time.
B0037ILWQI|3.0|I loved Tony Bourdain's show No Reservations so I figured I'd like this book. I was an easy read. It got on my nerves in some sections when he went on and on describing his odd ball friends in the industry.

0061478784|5.0|I have adored the Hayao Miyazaki's interpretation of Howl's Moving Castle for years. I must know the movie in its entirety by heart now. With that said, I cannot tell you how ashamed I am that I didn't know this was a book first (something I normally always check first) until a few years ago. When I found out I actually refused to read it for so long because I was afraid that the book was going to be monumentally better and I wouldn't get the same good feeling I did when I watched my favorite movie. (That's forgivable right?) Well, it wasn't until this last month that I ran out of books that interested me that I finally worked up the nerve and bought Diana Wynne Jones' Howl's Moving Castle.<br /><br />  My fear came true in a sense, I loved every word.<br /><br />  I found this book very difficult to put down, and went I got about halfway through I immediately went and ordered the sequel. I found the characters quite different from those I already love. Sophie is so witty and despite how she would get down on herself she was very strong (that whole inner strength thing right?). She wasn't intimidated by Howl and they way they would go back and forth at each other made their entire relationship so much better. Howl, is a selfish, childish, lazy (but works hard to be lazy if that makes sense), yet entirely loveable wizard who, yes, I did manage to fall a little in love with. All the characters are well developed and the story is strong. Though if I had a negative, toward the end I did get a little confused as everything was playing out.<br />  So, is my love for the movie totally sabatoged? Not at all. I found Miyazaki's film, while it has all the same characters and setting, the plot lines are very different. Yes, Sophie is turned into an old woman and finds her way into Howl's castle but other than that there are very few other similarities. Which as it turns out I like, I get a fantastic movie and two books and it all feels like 3 different stories to me.<br />  As for recommending it to others, go for it. As it turns out I had just finished the entire Harry Potter series (I know like 10 years later) before I read this and as I was reading through I couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe J.K. Rowling might have read this book at one point in her life. That's my sneaking suspicion anyway. All I know is that the magic and fantasy of Howl's Moving Castle gave me a very Harry Potter feel. But that's just me.<br />  To wrap things up, I have a new favorite. Which is saying something because I'm often hard to please book wise (I'm very picky, can't help it), but I'm very much looking forward to reading this again very soon (which is also saying something because I hardly ever read the same book more than once).for recommending it to others, go for it. As it turns out I had just finished the entire Harry Potter series (I know like 10 years later) before I read this and as I was reading through I couldn't help but think that maybe, just maybe J.K. Rowling might have read this book at one point in her life. That's my sneaking suspicion anyway. All I know is that the magic and fantasy of Howl's Moving Castle gave me a very Harry Potter feel. But that's just me.<br />  To wrap things up, I have a new favorite. Which is saying something because I'm often hard to please book wise (I'm very picky, can't help it), but I'm very much looking forward to reading this again very soon (which is also saying something because I hardly ever read the same book more than once).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is good no great but I think u should get more money every day love this game so over all this is one of my favorite games on my kindle
B00000IMTG|5.0|Amazing ! ! ! Great CD. A great recording of this great artist. A great buy. I recommend. You can buy because it is very good.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was a highly entertaining book that I could not put down. I have never been so let down by an ending....don't waste your money, you will be very disappointed !
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as i've enjoyed every other book by Ken Follett, most especially his historical novels.  Thoroughly engrossing story with vivid people and places.<br /><br />The second book of the series is on my Amazon wish list.  I bought Fall of Giants after the price had dropped and am hoping book 2 will also have a similar price drop sometime in the not too distant future.  $20 is far too much to pay for a Kindle edition book, especially when so many other books (that are just as good!) are available for free or very little.
1577311523|5.0|I would without a doubt recommend this little book to anyone who seeks a way out of pain/ paralysis from previous traumas and anxiety towards the unknown/ future. The content of this book may not be enormously useful to those who have not yet been close to their inner voice and desiring positive changes in structure of seeing self and the world while to those who have, Tolle's practical philosophy towards life and being could be revolutionary and meaningful.<br /><br />Here I would like to share the positive results of myself practicing the Power of Now. To be short, before this book, I had spent over two decades struggling with my family issues i.e. my parents being enormously unhappy and hence abusive (clinging unto their pain-body) due to problems with their own parents (another pain-bodies). I was so used to taking them (their pain-body) so seriously and literally that my life was simply hopeless: there was so much injustice, humiliation, and emotional/ physical abuse that I had naturally fit into the role of a victim. I ended up leaving the family and the country with a bag of traumatic feelings that repeated themselves in my head. I was always consumed by low self-esteem and detachment from the reality (such as not being able to talk to people because I thought they would do what my parent did to me).<br /><br />After reading this little book and later returned to my family, I managed to embark on a new relationship with my parents by acknowledging their pain-body and not let it respond to mine. The beginning was difficult as I could feel my \\"mind\\" wanting to react/ attack/ defend. After initial confrontation, I was able to be firm refusing to pain-body, mine and theirs. Surprisingly, my family and I now are in a good term and for the very first time, I have started to feel more in charge, instead of like a projector to previous pain.<br /><br />Would totally recommend those who are in the face of similar issues this practical method of seeing self and others.Being without being in previous or other people's pain is such a relief! Hope my sharing would help at all. Good luck!
B009AZZEU2|3.0|I wouldn't consider buying this cd, if you love the original sounding Soundgarden.  It's &#34;okay&#34;, just not great like I'm used to hearing.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The wife loves Star Trek and this one is no different.  Love all the extras on this 3 disc edition.  Bought it used and in excellent condition, saved alot of money.  Only negative I see is one particular curse word one time in the movie that I hate-gd.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Wow!<br />Great book!<br />R.I.P. Chris Kyle...Prayers continue for your family, our nation, SEAL's in harm's way, and your cause.<br />God Bless us all!
B005LAIGQE|5.0|This is a perfect movie for a Family Movie Night, or any other reason to watch a movie. Being based on a true-story, they had to stick close to the factuality as it happened; however, they did a great job mixing in other substories that really bring this movie full circle. It is easy to fall in love with these creatures and they really tug on your heart strings.<br /><br />The acting and directing are very well done. Barrymore and Krasinski have great on-screen chemistry, while Danson and Bell give superb supporting roles. All-in-all a great quality movie that you will enjoy again and again.
034580404X|3.0|With all the hype I was hearing I figured I had to see what all the fuss was about.  This author really likes the word &#34;clamber&#34;, and the book just didn't seem believable...not the dialogue or what the characters do.  Fantasy is one thing, but I couldn't get past the ridiculousness.  Other than that, if I really want to read porn, I'd rather get one of those Penthouse Forum books that contain different short stories.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe if we have another hurricane and lose power I'll finish it...
B00992CF6W|4.0|I miss the armor and other blocks, but, it still is good. I also wish there wasnt as much of a limited land area..
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Beautifully done program.  Would recommend to anyone. Enjoyed series one and two.  Looking forward to series three.  Very well done.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a decent read. It is not extraordinary but it's appeal lies in the simplicity. It will make you appreciate simple every day moments and as is Sparks' specialty romance and family take center stage... I enjoyed it!
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van halen was my best music of the 80's me and my brothers went to all the concerts bought all the records and just loved it. I needed to bring that joy back by buying this cd.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|it looks like it should be fun, but with no instructions it`s just frustration for my grandchild! with 3 adults around none of us can figure out what to do. my grandson loves the pretty ponys but won`t even look at this game anymore[[ASIN:B00A8ECU24 MY LITTLE PONY]]  Tardejoan
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a wonderfully  factual tale of survival, loss, patriotism and honor that also challenges the motives and charges of liberal politicians and media. Simper Fi
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you like these movies, this is the way to buy them.  Very economical.  Great Christmas gift.  You get a lot of bang for your book here.  All &#34;Alien&#34; movies are represented and edited scenes are back in.  Plus there are quite a few fun xtras.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Delightfully written story full of wonderful reflections on human and animal natures. A masterpiece of magical literature. Full of food for thought.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Good so.  I love the app. I love to play it. My sister does too.  I let my brother play it and he got me by 7 levels. It is so easy to play.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|There is nothing in this book that is believable. The writing is horrible. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because it is a page turner, though you are rolling your eyes most of the time.
B000HL09SA|5.0|I originally saw this movie years ago and loved it.  I chased it down again to watch another time and I still think it is a great family movie.  This movie brings back the memories of growing up with your favorite pet and the sadness you felt when they grew old.  Great performances by Frankie Munoz, Kevin Bacon, Skip of course and the rest of the cast.  If you havent seen this, sit down and watch it with the family, you wont be disappointed.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|I don't know what it is about his voice, but listening to this makes me want to rip off my clothes and jump on him.<br /><br />Unorthodox Jukebox has a different sound than Doo-Wops and Hooligans had, but his smooth voice remains.  I really like that this CD has a mixture of fast, fun songs and also those slow songs that make you want to light some candles and get into a bubble bath :-)
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love to play Mahjong! I put this down long enough just to review it. Awesome game. going back to play another round! Thank you FAOTD! Something good for a change.
B0083Z614S|5.0|The secret garden is a fabulous book. You are introduced to so many characters and they all change so dramatically. Anyone can read it but there's a lot of English talk and English Yorkshire language. I think that anybody who can't see positive things in life should read this book because it will change them so much. Read this book you won't regret it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|How wonderful it is to view the lives of these people. So much devotion to tradition and understanding of the differences between the downstairs staff and the upstairs land owners. They all function to make a very fulfilling live for everyone.
0788859544|5.0|very fast and looks new!! friendly feel from shipper and i love that it is guaranteed because it is used
B009EEFTMC|3.0|The game is great in terms of design and controls. However, the game lacks progression. There's no different levels to choose from, other than the standard solve and the cube attack. Being a fan of games that revolve around a campaign, I would've loved to have seen one for this game. Because of this, the game would get five stars if a campaign were implemented.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun to play everyone in the family like it from age 6 to 34!! Very easy to play for all ages!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I really enjoyed this album. To start a music career at a young age and be so good, that is what amazes me.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Simple and fun.  Looks good (I don't really like the water melons). Nice stage design. Can't stop playing. Should be good for all ages.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Love this book! It reminds me how to have meaningful communication with my wife in a language that she understands.<br />The idea may be simple. But when I read through it, some good examples illustrate the points in my simple language.<br />Fully recommend it even if you have been married for many years.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Abyss was very entertaining and had several challenging puzzles. Graphics were excellent and decent story line. Will  be trying more G5 games.
B002OG5GT8|5.0|Though tiny, this audio control is a vital addition for anyone listening to music or TV using headphones. Suddenly the variance in audio level from one TV channel to the next disappears. I wish I would have found this product years ago!
0553382152|5.0|I am a teacher and I can't keep this book on the shelf.  It gives people such hope.  Thank you.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I liked the movie. It looks great. There are flaws but I can suspend my disbelief.<br /><br />The main reason for my review is the disk kept freezing then gave a firmware update needed error. There is currently no newer firmware for my LG player and it played fine in my PS3.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was so good how addictive Eva and Gideon are to each other. I was in tears when Gideon told Eva about his past and he said I love you . FINALLY!<br /><br />Damn you Sylvia Day for making everyone wait till June to see what happens next!!!  I really hope it's worth it. Please don't let me down.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|The title says most of it. Mobo player is also able to play some videos which other players cannot play. Highly recommended.

B00846F1YW|4.0|sometimes the pictures are hard to figure out.<br />but I do like the game very much. I will tell my friends about.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|You need to put an update which releases more guns. This game is fun because multi player is intense.<br /> I had it for a month
B008WZHWCE|3.0|It was a good movie, not a lot of action slow starting. Not what you would expect from anthony hopkins.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|This review isn't fake. So this game I  think it should be top paid because it<br />really isn't that bad
B008MEM24S|5.0|its so addictive and fun! It is nice to play a game that doesn't require money for extra turns or helps.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Need to add more robots like the one from the apple app store but overall it is a good game
B003CBVU30|4.0|This movie gives you plenty to laugh about. It's one you can find yourself watching over and over again if you like to laugh.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|Let me start out by saying this is the most underated Floyd album ever. This record is pure genius and the lyrics are even more fitting today than they were back in the release of this album in 1977. Roger Waters paints a grim picture of society and hits the nail right on the head. I've been a Floyd fan since 1971 and Animals is by far one of their best albums. With that being said, I have to say this is the absolute worst recording I have ever heard for this album. I have owned ever single version of Animals, 8 track, cassette tape, vinyl record and multiple CD versions. This is garbage. How this can be called a remaster is beyond me. I have a pretty good high end stereo and when playing this CD it makes it sound like a fisher price pile of crud. The best recording of this album is on vinyl. When I saw this on amazon and read the reviews, I thought could it really be a decent mix of this classic record after listening to all the other sub par flat sounding versions. I will be using this as a coffee coaster because that's about it's good for. Such a shame, a fantastic album and no one can get it right. Do your self a favor and don't waste your money on this garbage. You want to hear what this record really sounds like than find your self the vinyl version of it and play it on a quality turn table. I'm willing to bet anything that you will want to take the CD version and toss it in the trash, especially this so called remaster. Very disappointing. 5 stars for the album in its self and 5 stars to amazon for the excellent packaging and fast shipping, as always. Zero stars for the remaster version of this record.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|This movie has all, the actor's, Mark Wahlburg, Charlize Theron, Edward Norton, Seth Green, Jason Statham,<br />Mos Def, Franky G, and Donald Southerland...it has the action, the planning of the crime, back-stabbing, great car chase,<br />revenge...and the most important..the payoff...fast, furious, hi octane movie...must see movie..
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Usually I read a few pages a night...just enough to savour the prose, clear my head and fall asleep. Anthony Ryan's work is so textured and immersive I was trapped; something that has not happened since I read some of Robin Hobbs' early stuff.<br /><br />This guy is a serious talent, I hope he makes enough out of his writing to quit his day job.<br /><br />Fantastic (except that I have to wait for Book 2 to be published).
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is the first time in a few days after all,I haven't played with that game for a while so It was AWESOME!!!!!
0810989956|5.0|I loved the activities and the book keeps you really busy. I recommend it to 8 to 20 year olds!
B0007OCG4W|5.0|This movie won &#34;2 golden globes&#34; with a all star cast of Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman,<br />and Clive Owen...smart, witty, love story of 4 adults who have attractions to each other, from meetings<br />in open public, to the work place, to betrayals...the things (words) that came out of there mouths, made my<br />mouth drop....what did she say??? (Julia Roberts)....they all had one thing in common...each other..wow..
B0056BMK6K|1.0|Read it. Deleted it from my Kindle.<br /><br />Common sense. Basic marketing principles. Lots of financial investment.<br /><br />Still, Locke's fiction books must have something going for them.<br /><br />I probably should have read one of those first.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Really enjoyed the twist midway. Super steamy to start, but gut wrenching at the end. Not a typical \\"romance\\" read.
0374214913|5.0|Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore is a romp of a first novel by Robin Sloan. It’s a perfect book for booklovers who lean toward the mysterious and fantastic, blurring genre lines throughout to afford readers a marvelous time.<br /><br />The novel begins when Clay Jannon, the first-person narrator, is responding to an advertisement for a clerk in a 24-hour bookstore in San Francisco. Clay was educated as a graphic artist, but he’s finding jobs scarce since his work designing a logo and a website for a bagel bakery and acting as the “voice” of @NewBagel on Twitter — definitely a new economy sort of job. When the bakery went bust along with the rest of the economy less than a year after Clay took the job, he was left jobless with a very slim resume. So the help wanted ad in the window of the bookstore seems like a godsend, even though Clay questions whether the bookstore is a legitimate employer — after all, legitimate employers advertise on Craigslist, not in their windows, right? Clay suspects that “24-Hour Bookstore” is a euphemism for something distasteful.<br /><br />He’s wrong about that, but he’s right that there’s something weird about the place. For one thing, there are almost no customers. In fact, there are almost no books, either, at least not the normal sort of books you would expect to be on offer. The bookstore is oddly shaped, too:<br /><br />&#34;[I]magine the shape and volume of a normal bookstore turned up on its side. This place was absurdly narrow and dizzyingly tall, and the shelves went all the way up — three stories of books, maybe more.…<br /><br />&#34;The shelves were packed close together, and it felt like I was standing at the border of a forest — not a friendly California forest, either, but an old Transylvanian forest, a forest full of wolves and witches and dagger-wielding bandits all waiting just beyond moonlight’s reach. There were ladders that clung to the shelves and rolled side to side. Usually those seem charming, but here, stretching up into the gloom, they were ominous. They whispered rumors of accidents in the dark.&#34;<br /><br />A dedicated group of individuals visit the store to borrow books from the special collection housed in those ominous shelves; they never pay any money, and they ask for the volumes by the name on the spine, which appears to be simply the last name of the author.<br /><br /> Mr. Penumbra hires Clay for the night-time shift, from 10:00 p.m. until 6:00 a.m. He tells him not to look into any of the books in the back of the store, the ones on those high shelves, but only retrieve them for customers. And Clay must also keep precise records of all transactions, including not just what book was given to whom, but the time, the customer’s appearance, the customer’s state of mind, and anything else that Clay might observe, down to the material of which the customer’s coat buttons are made. It’s all very strange, but it’s an easy enough job.<br /><br />But Clay can’t resist looking into those books. And there he finds… gibberish. And then Clay becomes curious about the mysteries in the store and tries to unravel them. It is a trip that will lead him deep into data networks and across the country, and give him a fair bit of insight into himself.<br /><br />Sloan’s novel is about the intersection of books and technology, a subject of intense concern to many of us who love books in all their many forms, books as art, books as objects, books as repositories of information, books as sources of pleasure. The writing is lively and the plot is deliciously complicated. The novel contains both joy and melancholy, but ultimately, it is forward-looking, about how anyone can find his or her own place in the new world in which we find ourselves.<br /><br />It may seem strange that I see this book as straddling genres; there are no spells, no magic, no wizards (excepting always those who are wizards with technology, which mostly means Googleemployees in this novel). But it has the air of fantasy, of the mysticism inherent in books, of the magic of puzzles and those who devote their lives to solving them. And, of course, there’s a secret society; maybe that’s enough. Or maybe I just loved this book so much that I want everyone to have the joy of reading it. Take my word for it, fantasy fans: you’ll like Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore.
030758836X|3.0|Flynn tells a most fantastic story from the two main character's points of view.  The story easy to get caught up in.  The characters provoked complicated feelings.  I liked and disliked both the protagonist and antagonist at different times during the book.  But the end was absolutely terrible!  What a let down.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is very inspirational.  It is the best NDE (near death experience) book I have ever read.  Everyone should read this book no matter what religion you may be a part of.

159420411X|5.0|Possible audiences for The Signal in the Noise:<br />The Technical Reader, Trained Statistician - this is not a sophisticated analysis and you will be disappointed in its relative lack of advanced discussion.<br />The General Reader with a passing interest in larger issues - there is much happening in the mathematical world around you that impacts you in ways you may not appreciate. This book is very much for you and will benefit you in ways detailed below.<br />Data Crunchers - people employed to use large amounts of data but not fully trained in the ways of statistical analysis ,needing a better appreciation of how to make your data sing. This book is custom-made for you.<br /><br />Nate Silver has written a very readable and well documented introduction to the subject of Bayesian statistics. This method was originally developed in the 1700s. It has been lost, found, refuted, suppressed, and re-derived several times since then. The Signal and the Noise champions Bayesian analysis in the context of a larger isue. The larger discussion is the near impossibility of making predictions about the complexities of our world armed only with the ever-growing databases that populate the 21st century. While heavily favoring baseball and gambling as examples in probabilistic thinking Mr. Silver presents the case that we can improve the value of our forecasts when we employ Bayesian mathematics.<br /><br />Of the several books I have recently read describing the history of Bayesian math and it's ability to forecast some issues better than classical frequentism, The S and N contains the best and simplest description of the formula driving Bayesian analysis. It is virtually the only formula in the book.<br /><br />Nate Silver has been politicized. In recent years he has refused to call elections based on political preference and in this book he does not reflexively deny the theory of climate change. Therefore he is anathema to the politically driven. Deep in the footnotes of the last chapter there is a dig against Al Gore but evidently this is not enough to establish him as a neutral voice. Nate Silver's is a neutral voice. To the degree that he has been successful in calling a number of recent elections it is because he is better at numbers than those who put the demands of political left/ political right in front of all else.last chapter there is a dig against Al Gore but evidently this is not enough to establish him as a neutral voice.

B0063IH60K|4.0|It's solitaire. What is there to say? A computer or tablet would not be complete without it. The game works well but ad is a little tricky. Watch out for it.
0812550706|4.0|It's galactic war. The humans are hopelessly out matched. They seek to mold a perfect weapon because they'll only get on knock-out punch. There's moral grey areas explored in weaponizing children. This future book is well set for our times of drone uses to kill people. The child Ender is believable and nicely illustrates the author's point about war and ethics.<br /><br />Read this book and enjoy it for what it is: tragedy and triumph. .
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is an awesome app. I've downloaded so many others that are not even half as good. Happy puzzling... lol
B008XBCJ34|3.0|I thought it would came with 3 different discs but it came with blu-ray 3D and regular version on the same disc and a dvd disc
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I downloaded this game and played to four levels and then was stumped. It took my 7 yo coming to visit me to get any further. She had a little difficulty, but nothing like I had. Takes a lot of patience. Guess that was my problem all along. Really is a good game.
B008518MOW|2.0|The show is great, but the 3D disk was inoperable twice. Finally returned for credit. The 2D version is fine.
0143116371|5.0|Maybe it's because the camera distances one, or maybe simply because he's photographed so many people, but Scott is very self-aware. He is comfortable explaining WHY he chooses certain things. Of course the photos are interesting, sometimes beautiful, but to get to why something has value is an amazing (and relatively rare) thing. Personally, I would be interested in a book with more insight (aka more writing, of course still with images). Many people think that fashion is flighty and impermanent. This book however demonstrates that, regardless of your position, fashion can be a direct conduit to the mind and soul of the individual, and a wonderful conversation between the individual and the world.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This note so has everything you'd want. It's got way more features than I even know how to use! It's simple, but elaborate. No handwriting feature to my knowledge... but I don't personally miss that too much. Everything works fully without internet. No major glitches or complaints. Love it.

B009U9S6FI|5.0|Much of what we know about life in various Nazi concentration camps comes from Frankl, I realized as I finally read his book. I bought it when I was trying to support a friend who was enduring one of life's random tragedies. I do not believe in a god who never sends us more than we can bear. In fact, I don't believe God sends us good or ill events, and Frankl's work supports my view.  What he does show is that under the most heinous of circumstances, humans have the ability to make moral choices, and that is powerful information.<br /><br />Frankl-- who survived when his pregnant wife, parents and other relatives did not-- went on to show that not all prisoners were moral and all guards immoral. Within extremely narrow parameters, both had the freedom to embrace life and to aid others. He was also insightful about what signaled impending death. I guess I should not be surprised that after the war, Frankl opposed the theory of collective guilt; he was loathe to condemn whole societies, which is what makes him out of step with many Holocaust scholars and (in my reading) with other prominent moral teachers of his era.<br /><br />The last part of the book sets out his theories of logotherapy in which he held that the purpose of psychotherapy is to help patients make meaning of their lives rather than find happiness or resolve various complexes. It's interesting that logotherapy is almost unknown today, although some of his ideas seem to bubble up in existential therapies. As it turns out, Man's Search is condensed from longer writings he produced after liberation. The book in English is so lucid that I forgot that he lived all this experience \\"in German.\\" Unlike many psychological writings, this one does not suffer from the restriction of categories that don't quite translate. I suspect that's one reason is still resonates with readers as it did with me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|dis game is de best Mhen it I luvvs it soo muchh buy it dont worry bout the price its worth it
B005ETA5K2|2.0|I bought this item and paid twice as much for the shipping because I needed to receive, install, and test it for my wife before she went on a trip.  I was supposedly compatible with OS X 10.8.  In fact, I did find a few pages that talked about how to install it, and also provided URL's for the 10.8 driver.  After two days of experimenting however my wife left and I still hadn't gotten it to function.  Essentially wasted about $70 dollars on this product.  Don't buy it if you're running Mountain Lion.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game literally plays like Mario.  Double jumping to kill enemies and collecting 100 coins to gain an extra life are deflinitely Mario-game aspects.  Thats really the only reason I give this game 4 stars, otherwise it's a great oldschool game.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|Spoiler Alert! If anyone who reads this is a fan of horror movies please see this! This movie to me is thriller and suspense done at it's best! This movie to me came as a complete shock, I had no clue I would like it as much as I did. When I first heard about the movie and seen the trailors I thought the name was silly so I didnt expect much. After all the horror genre sucks nowadays. Nothing but remakes or teen scream movies. I was nearly jumping out of seat watching this. Superb story, action, and Grade A+++ acting! Jessica Chastain and the little girl actresses ooze talent! Best I have seen in a long time. The only thing that left me kind of sad was the ending :( I wanted both the girls to be saved.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best app ever! My mom and I are addicted to this game! We always have competitions to see who has the highest score. I recommend this app to everyone. My little brother and sister even like it!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Not so good as the book one. I was waiting this book two with impatience, but I am not more impatient about book three.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I know this isn't a movie, but I could picture every moment, every smile, and every tear.  This is an unorthodox love story, yet pure and true. This story outline how true love can be despite life unlikely challenges. It shows how the underdog was not such an underdog. This story presented a challenge to our moral obligations to our love ones and ourselves. Choice is powerful freedom that we are afraid to honor, when faced with insincerities. Great job, Jojo, great job!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Although Howey tells a good story of a post apocalyptic world he leaves gaps in the character development of his major characters that would have made the story more satisfying to me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|F temple run the best game ever I mean mystery box surf board one of the best games I play on Amazon literary
B00992CF6W|5.0|l think minecraft is fun on survival mode but in creative you cant get lava or water also on creative mode I think you should be able to blow up Tnt. they should really upgrade poker ed.
0785163174|5.0|Engaging story line, good character development throughout the series. I'm more of an X-Men fan than an Avengers fan, but the authors did a great job of blurring the lines between &#34;good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34;.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|Blackberry Smoke is a WINNER, and this album is no exception. Great stuff, especially \\"Ain't Much Left of Me\\", \\"Up the Road\\" and \\"Everybody Knows She's Mine\\". Third album I own by the Blackbery Smoke, and they continue to impress. Super Value for the MP3 download, go see them \\"live\\" when you can.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|The Ekatoni holder did not fit my device but it was well made  but I sent it back as it did not fit. I do not like this type of evaluation of products.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|It doesn't work. I may have to take it off from my Kindle Fire HD. It doesn't download any of my e-mails. Needs major fixes!
030758836X|4.0|I was absolutely surprised. This book is way better than I expected and shockingly twisted. The first 50-100 pages are dragging...but then the book picks up speed and at times it was hard to put it down. I did not like the ending and I feel like she just wanted to wrap it up,but other than that it was great.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is great for children and I read it to my child and both he and an loved it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|It is a  thrilling book that keeps the reader alert and a certain stressing mode.To reach the 5 stars qualification less Initial Letters of Groups, Organizations, Types of Weapons, etc would have made easier and more fluent the reading.<br /><br />en libro pero no llega a 5  estrellas porque incluye muchas siglas y se hace difícil recordarlas . Por momentos complica seguir la trama.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I just love it! It downloads my e-mails, without any problem. Hotmail, you need to follow suit, if you want a great product!
B00015YVD6|5.0|Love this movie. I purchased it for the third time so now my grandchildren can see what movie their mom adored. Came during time estimated to arrive. Excellent condition as promised. It was packaged adequately: no over doing it by over packaging which requires more effort to open or material wasted that end up in the landfill.
B0006Q0XDW|4.0|Haven't heard them in awhile and amazed that I can still buy them on vinyl.  Great gift!  My son is a teenager and he loves The Clash!  That means the 80s definitely rules!
B000086EOE|5.0|What can you say about Steve Hackett? When he left Genesis, their music hanged and declined in quality. This Genesis Revisited CD spotlights his virtuoso playing.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed this one! Very good storyline,graphics.  I found the mystery interesting by the way you find the clues about the plot and the way you analyze the data. Lots of hidden objects and mini puzzles.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|He's written another brilliant story. Where does he come up with this stuff? All I can say is whether u read the book or u see the movie, skip applying your mascara before hand! I cried all through out the last quarter of the book.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I love EVERY song on this CD. I know that every Maroon 5 fan will love it too. If you're not a fan of them yet, give this CD a try.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I am glad we rented this movie instead of buying it. I read reviews and was looking forward to a quirky but interesting movie. It was indeed quirky but completely uninteresting. You never care for the characters and I kept hoping one would turn into a zombie. Don't waste your time with this dull senseless pablum.
B0058DRUV6|2.0|This is one of those books that make a lot of success and I don't understand wy. As Daniel Kahneman points in his book \\"Thinking fast and slow\\", the right way to test cause and effect here would be to have a group of companies applying some practices while a control group does it differently. Based on those results you can get a clearer understanding of what has more chance of helping you / your company.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I love this game. This game is also cool because it is free and is easy to play also it is challenging so thank you for making this game I hope you make sequel to this game thank you.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|I hadn't read this since middle school, and happily rediscovered the Asimov robot trllogy this past year.  Given its publication date, it is amazing what Asimov foretold of the possible problems in the future.  Very cool reading for the sci-fi fan.
B00914JWSW|5.0|\\"Release Me\\" is an effective pun for songs that have been in the vaults over a span of years.  That they are released now in this set is cause for celebration for all of us who are awed by Streisand's talent.  The opener \\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough\\" is breathtaking with Streisand's performance from 1985 victorious with a bit of grit as she sings, \\"I'll be the best or nothing at all.\\"  Her 1970 recording of Jimmy Webb's classic \\"Didn't We\\" is as powerful as the song is timeless 40+ years later.  From that same year, her recording of Randy Newman's \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\\" cuts to the heart of the sadness of the song while her gorgeous voice highlights the lovely melody, \\"Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles, with frozen smiles to chase love away, human kindness is overflowing & I think it's going to rain today.\\"  The studio version of \\"With One More Look At You\\" for \\"A Star Is Born\\" soars with the gorgeous melody and Streisand's emotionally laden performance.  While these are my personal favorites, all of the music on \\"Release Me\\" certainly deserves to find its audience.  Firooz Zahedi's gorgeous cover photograph hints at the drama in the music.  Enjoy!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Challenging but not so hard that I wanted to give up. Graphics are great and the hint option really helps if you're stuck. Fun game!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|A younger Dave Matthews. Soulful and professional. Every song is good, Phillips voice is smooth and edgy, the entire album with an acoustic feel.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|This is an interesting book about the possile conflagration of events that help to make &#34;greats&#34; great.  The stories are fascinating, and worth a read.  Some of the tying together of the thoughts seem rushed, particularly at the end.  That being said, the books does give interesting anecdotes about how hard work and practice pay off.  I don't see my kids being motivated by it though.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Season five didn't disappoint. I liked the Ronnie Cox character, which provided Dexter with a glimpse of his own future. The cliff hanger in the season finale was epic.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have to admit that this book was on my radar of what to read for a long time before I read it. I read some fantastic reviews, but they had me scared of the emotional scarring I might incur upon reading this book! I finally caved, and I'm so glad I did. This book was just amazing. Yes, there are some situations that are harder to read about, but they are real and these things, unfortunately, happen. The way Colleen writes the tough stuff gets the point across without being graphic and making you uncomfortable. And the banter between Sky and Holder is so much fun to read. My only wish for book is for more Breckin. I loved him and would have liked to see more of him. However that isn't even enough for me to knock a star off! Is is a book that I will read over and over I'm sure!
B00881VLCE|2.0|This is nice, but really dislike being unable to do anything else on the device (kindle fire hd) without restarting a puzzle.
067003830X|4.0|I enjoyed this book, found it full of interesting facts. I also enjoyed the personal stories, which stirred many different emotions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|one of the best games I have ever played it is so indictable.you never stop trying either to save up for something or try to get a new high score!!!!!!
0307887898|3.0|The same good idea repeated many times. But it's nice to enterpreneurs learn how data-driven marketing can help your company....

1452110581|5.0|This is  absolutely essential for cat lovers.  They will immediately recognize their feline friends--and laugh their heads off!  I was given one as a gift and bought three more for some of my friends.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|awesome. cool. sweet. Mario. Mario. Mario. Mario. Luigi. leprechun. I enjoy this game because it is a legit copy of Mario. plus you are able to throw pinecones
0891419195|5.0|Having watched the film \\"PACIFIC\\" itself dramatic to watch, the book takes you even deeper to how these Marine's suffered and died as seen by the Author as he fought along side them.
B001DSNEJM|5.0|This movie is an excellent example of the amazing capability that Paul Walker has as an actor.  It is not an easy movie to watch, some of it is quite disturbing and yet he lets his character flow so smoothly.  The cast that plays with him works well and the story has a happy ending.  Paul should be given more opportunities to show his acting talent in more serious roles (Oscar winning type of roles).  I recommend this movie to those who like to watch a good thriller unfold.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app, many times it is accurate, or at least come close to accuracy.  Know one can truly predict the minute to minute of the weather, but this app comes close.  I use this app everyday, instead of the tv news weather channel.  I would recommend this app.
034580404X|5.0|E. L. James did a fantastic job of research for these books....<br /><br />Hopefully will help a lot of couples with their sex lives...
0062515675|4.0|Book tries to convey strong message that external material wealth and social prestige are not the key for the internal happiness that every humans are seeking. Your thought is more important and with beautiful thought human can be extremely happy even in the raw nature. I liked the subject matter of the book and writer tried to present beautifully. I enjoyed reading it.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I like the writing, acting and characters. The stories are very intriguing and you never know the ending until the ending. I watch them over and over and never get tired of them.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great read! The amount of intricate details makes this book difficult to get a hold of at first, but it's the details that make Martin's world seem less of a fantasy and more of a reality worthy of exploring. Can't wait to read the sequels and watch the show!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|temple run 2 was terrible the first one was amazing but this one sucks....sucks...hate it graphics suck it freezes way to much on my kindle fire my sister has it on her samsung galaxy phone its ok on there but on a kindle fire it sucks take my word for it DONT get it on a kindle fire

B008NEMN0K|1.0|I've proudly collected most all 3D Blurays available in the US since the beginning. I must say that I ROBOT is the worst 3D conversion I've ever experienced. I actually sold it on ebay for $9.  It looked like a pop-out book - simply unsatisfactory.  FOX/SONY has boasted about their new techniquest to convert 2D Classics to 3D classics.  Note to Fox/Sony:  PLEASE DON\\"T RUIN ANY FURTHER CLASSICS IN YOUR CATALOG WITH THIS QUALITY CONVERSION.  I was so Dissappointed - a Great Movie in a horrible 3D presentation.<br /><br />Sony/Fox should take some pointers from Pixar or James Cameron for the future 2D- 3D conversion.  You thought Last Airbender 3D was bad - experience I-ROBOT and it makes the Airbender look like a classic.  Shame on you Fox/Sony - Give us better quality 3D Conversions and we'll buy them.
B009C7JS14|1.0|This is a great looking app but it force closes as soon as I open it on my nook color. Really quite sad as I wanted to give it a try.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just finished the book. It was so good. Sad that there has to be domestic abuse in relationships.  Courageous when you get of them.Profound when you find true love to help heal. You'll love the book. Nicolas Sparks is a great writer!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I really enjoyed Dark Places.by Gillian Flynn.  It was a great mystery thriller that was difficult to put down.  Give me more Flynn!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Leps world two is amazing!!I haven't played the first one,bout judging by the way this games is,I'm guessing it's pretty good
B0000042MY|5.0|Love this..play it over and over..  I have listened to this so many times and I knew when I heard the music in the movie that I as going to have to buy the cd.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|It was an okay....Makes folks over 50 look stupid and that don't have sex....I wanted to go to the movie theatre to see this; glad I didn't....
B000JMKNV0|4.0|A good book for anyone who likes a fast paced thriller. Keeps you guessing all through to the end. A great overall read.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Not typically the genre I gravitate towards, The Silver Linings Playbook was an odd change of pace for me.  Reading first person POV when the character is suffering from mental problems made things a bit interesting.  I loved, loved, loved Tiffany and her balls-to-the-walls mindset on life. I'm pretty sure most of us have dealt with heartbreak at some point in sour lives.  The two main characters suffer very different forms of it, but in the end, it is still a heart that is broken and people & life are the often the remedy.  I really liked this book.  Well done, Matthew Quick.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|I purchased this set of Lego's for my daughter for Christmas 2012; she loved it and the multicolored legos inside.  The boy has a ton of Star Wars Legos but liked to &#34;borrow&#34; some of the multicolored ones for use in various ships and buildings.  This is an awesome Lego set for girls, and it is full of purples, pinks and &#34;girly&#34; colors to separate it from the boy sets.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Thought this show was going to be better....Glad I didn't use the money to go to the theatre....Very disappointing.....Thanks. But no thanks....
B003F3NDWG|5.0|All I can do is ditto what I had to say for the third season.  Love it, love it, love it!  It's well worth watching..
B00005JKZV|5.0|Awesome DVD.  Although we had the movie, we did not have the theatrical edition.  My husband is a Tolken fan and he has to have them all.  Great transaction with seller
B008OOYALE|2.0|Very good game, great graphics and Teamlava has helped me a lot with issues I have needed help with. My biggest complaint is that all platforms do not get the same items to enjoy. IPad, android and Kindle players are not created equal.i.e. some get New dragons, some don't. Some get different challenges to play to win cool items,some don't. Some get the ability to craft New Dragon/swap dragons, some don't. Some can upgrade to different versions, others can't. Would be more enjoyable, if the games catered to all.
B00371XIJE|5.0|I loved this movie; it was so sad.....But it was such a great show and it was a true story....
B003L77FYS|5.0|I'm quite a big fan of Castle.  It's a mixture of mystery,some comedic antics and a little bit of action.  Everything a person enjoys without getting bored in the process.  I will always keep up with this show.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins is truly gifted. I can not begin to tell you the vast range of emotions I went through while reading this trilogy. Book 1 paints a vivid picture of a society twisted by the whims of the elite and privileged. Ridiculous waste vs dire need and neglect. Then the horrors of the barbaric games. Children forced to fight to the death. The Olympics turned dark, sinister and lethal. Two ill prepared kids from one of the poorest areas, become unwitting heroes and a threat to the status quo. Book 2. No matter what she does, says, or doesn't do our doesn't say, Katniss becomes the focal point of a growing rebellion. And no matter how hard she tries to keep them out, her family, friends and eventually the whole town suffers for something she had no control over. But she continues to fight to protect those closest to her, even though some of the lines begin to blur. Blow after blow Katniss rallies for one more try, one more attempt to help regardless of the fact that more of her soul gets lost and shredded each time. Book 3 She is at the end of her rope. There's so little left to hold on to that Katniss begins to lose her grip. Like Peeta, her tortured existence has warped the fabric of reality into a grim final last ditch effort to right all the unspeakable wrongs committed by her feeble attempts to save the few left to her and kill the one responsible for her misery. When she is at last free, the one true hope for everything she tried to do is there to mend the sheds of her heart mind and soul. I will need at least a week to get past all this. OUTSTANDING.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is awesome I love how it is so realistic and gives you a choice in picking your horse. Really good game.
B0063GORYU|1.0|The screen/print is too small for my old eyes to see this one well enough to play it on the KF.  SIGH
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It was awsome more blood more zombies more guts more killing and it took place in an over ran prison with zombie prisoners which was pretty cool
B003O86FMW|5.0|OK, there should be a warning attached to this one that says: Caution! May cause the reader to develop a nervous condition!  I was about to pull my Locs out.  And when Katniss was setting if Beetee was alive of dead, Co-worker tapped me on the shoulder and I almost took him OUT! I'm afraid to start book 3 but I HAVE to know how this ends!  (I just can't read at work any more. :(

B0063IH60K|2.0|I play this but it is too boring.  I play a game now and again when I'm somewhere where I don't have wifi.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I've used this to publish three kindle books now and it's my &#34;go to&#34; to make sure I get the formatting right. There are a couple of discrepancies between what's said here and what is directed on KDP when you upload your book.... one example is the ideal cover size. But this is likely due to the date when this was published and updates since then. When in doubt, go with what KDP says.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|It turns upside down when I start  so I can't play and I beat it on my first try. And it is not even scary
1250007208|5.0|A perfect blend of post-apocalyptic sci-fi, fairytale, and fantasy. Meyer does a beautiful job exploring Cinder's inner struggles as a stepchild (ok, that one was obvious), a racial minority (cyborg)  and a girl with a physical challenge (no foot), while slowly revealing the true story of Cinder's past and the intrigue of an interstellar battle for power. There's so much going on in one book, and I'm terribly impressed that Meyer pulled it off so well!
B000Q7B8FS|1.0|Although I really do love the Bourne movies and I purchased this where is it?  How do I view it?
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|one long commercial. advertisment for catepillar audi honda and more. got so bored i had to leave the theater. disappointing.
0790732203|5.0|Awesome price for an older movie.  Played without skips or problems and was exactly what I was looking for at the time.
0345803507|5.0|I haven't actually read the book yet, I am still one book one.  The book arrived in perfect timing and in perfect shape.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Would recommend to all.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Even though I'm old, I love all things Disney.  I will eventually probably purchase all I can find.  I'm starting with the newer ones and then will get all the old familiar ones.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I couldn't put it down. Excited for the rest of the story in book 2, the pulse!
B003PIUBZS|2.0|Major scratches on first and second disks so large chunks of the disk is unreadable.  I would think twice before buying again.
0345803485|5.0|Great book.  Great shipping and condition.  I bought all three books at one time, so I am looking forward to reading them all.  I would certainly consider purchasing again.
B000Q79HTC|1.0|Same comment as for the previous one.  I love the Bourne movies but I don't know where to watch this video.  Where is it?
B007SGLZP8|5.0|There was always enough action to keep me reading, yet it took a long while for me to really figure out the details of the plan.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Good price for an older movie.  Disk was in good shape and played without any problems.  I'd buy it again.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The best Daniel Craig BOND performance by far. Finally a new 007 that has a fantastic plot throughout the ENTIRE movie, AND maintaining excellent pursuit and explosion scenes that we come to expect from this series. And for the heineken critics....your doubts shall be silenced!!Didn't expect the ending, but what a great (actor) way to set up the next movie!!! 5 stars all the way
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game.  Have not had any issues wit this app. Would recommend downloading this app for all.  Have fun and play
0061992860|5.0|This book speaks for itself, I believe every man should own a copy of this book, the contents truly could save your life and the information is laid out in a clear and understandable manner. The size is perfect to implement in a BOB (Bug Out Bag). It's compact and light. If you own a bug out bag this should be one of your main items. HIGHLY SUGGESTED!
B007RTAR64|5.0|This doll is very pretty and well made. She came with three arrows and a wonderful bow. She was a bit hard to get out of<br />her box but I love her!<br />I think any Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter fan like me would love love love her! She is much more beautiful than her picture.<br />And her bow can shoot the arrows.<br />I don't know much about Hunger Games because I'm nine, but when I found out Amazon had a lower price than the toy store I bought her.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The detail in this writers mind just carry you from page to page. I love to read the way he thinks and solves the most impossible problems. The ending is a grabber.
B003A060TW|4.0|First off, I saw Caribou open for Radiohead last summer and they were awesome. I asked for and received a copy of Swim for Valentines Day and it sounds great. Luckily I didn't have problems with my vinyls like another reviewer, they play just fine and aren't warped at all. Luckily Amazon returns are really easy too so if you get a bad seed, exchange it. (I had to do that with a Burial album recently)<br /><br />Oh, and it's not stated (on Amazon or the album itself) but the vinyls are actually 45 speed so make sure to adjust your turntable accordingly.
B0007939NO|5.0|Excellent DVD.  Would recommend it for children, or adults.  Price was acceptable, as was the delivery time.  Will order additional DVDs at a later time.  I will recommend this DVD to others.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved...loved  this book....so much more exciting details than the movie. I can't wait to read the next two books.
1609611543|2.0|Give up all the things you like and do it fast. Your very lifeis in danger. How do I know? Bad science and misinterpreted studies tell me so.
0007447868|4.0|A great easy read. The story goes along following the characters as the plots continue to unfold. Found myself a little disappointed with some of the developments, but wanted to read more. Waiting for the last book is the hardest part.
B008XCPO2Q|5.0|AWESOME, GREAT MOVIE AND GREAT SERVICE, IT DID COME A DAY LATE BUT IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT I LOVE IT.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This is a great series of books that effectively weave mythology and the events in the books. I immediately got the next book when I finished the previous one. I picked it up because of the Sorcerer's Stone. Tangential to Harry Potter, but great in its own right.
B00008BLB8|5.0|Caught In The Act contains all the great songs recorded live on one CD. If you are looking for some good Grand Funk this may be the only one you will need. Sounds clean and great.[[ASIN:B000TERC08 Caught In The Act]]
B0050PYNO4|4.0|Love this movie!! got it for my friend's birthday and he loved receiving it. The condition was new and perfect for a gift.
B001QFZADA|3.0|The book departs from principles that are truly useful (even revolutionary) to enhance your love life by connecting with your love ones in ways that they feel loved. It also helps you to identify which love language is your primary one, the one that fulfils you the most, and to ask for it. Such a simple thing, but makes you turn your relationships around.<br /><br />The test at the end of the book is really useful to identify your personal love language. The \\"questions to ponder\\" at the end of each chapter are very useful, too, and some of the hints on how to be a good listener or how to discover other people's love language are truly practical and helpful.<br /><br />After reading the book I have understood many things that are now so obvious and eye-opening about my dating guy.<br /><br />There are a few things I don't like about the book: 1/ it is very repetitive; 2/ its approach to sex is very conservative; 3/ many of the things said here are a repetition from other books from the author; and 4/ the real-life examples are way to long and detailed so the point gets lost a bit. He transcribes entire conversations with his customers, which go for pages!<br /><br />Still, this is a terrific book and the advice given is fantastic.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The move to the Roman gods and the collaboration of the Roman and the Greek demigods is very well done.  It pulled me in like Riordan's other books. Anxiously looking forward to the next one - The House of Hades.

0670024813|4.0|As usual, as in all his excellent works, Diamond weaves his research into a compelling essay as to why traditonal values transcend time and are applicable in the modern world.  Only issue is that his geographical concentration is limited and he draws understandable examples from a society the world has not touched.  MIght have appreciated a wider more balanced presentation that incorporated a larger scale of global references to paint his landscape of inspection.  Would also have liked if he worked into the text theories with cross-cultural determinants such as the Hofested values as it seems that traditional socieites are more collective then individualistic; and such is the core of his treatise.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|An unbeatable combination.  Great little pocket sharpener.  I carry it everywhere.  A few strokes of a dull blade through it and you can cut any thing again.  Makes a great gift too.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This series of books is somewhat violent and bloody, but not more than the story can handle. Can't wait until this movie comes out.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|My father is dying and this book has helped me with the fact that he will be in a better place. There is nothing more comforting than to know where they will be and how happy and loved they will feel.
B00004X0M6|5.0|Excellent product.  This is the best ever purchase of my life.  I can't believe how lucky I am for buying this product.  My life has changed for the best.  For ever.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Decided these books are heavy when traveling and so tried the kindle version, an great story around different but connected group of people that has you feeling part of the story
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series of books is riveting. sometimes disgusting - the reapings. Katniss is a great role model. She is very resourceful, brave, kind, and focused on what is right. I've read through the threee books twice and watched the movie. Couldn't put the book down.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I am now having this problem too! When I first got the app last year, no probs, but now I also have the issue of not knowing where it is saving my edited photo. Looked everywhere. Only conclusion? Looks like it is saving, but is not! Should be a menu item anyway to list where you want them saved! Very disappointed!
B006PAZMMK|5.0|Skrillex knows how to bring the beats! I can't stop listening to this! I would reccomend it to anyone and everyone!
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Dear Service-Staff,<br />I am totally happy with your Items and your performance for all of the items.<br />Brgds<br />Willy Reichelsdorfer
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The 2nd and 3rd books build nicely on the first book and, for the 3rd one, on the book before it. Sad that there won't be anymore from this author.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I do not remember any other film that brought on more tears than War Horse.  The horse that was used in the movie is so intelligent that one wonders how did they train him to do so many magnificent things.  The scene rushing through No Mans Land had me out of my seat , crying , yelling &#34;Joey, Joey come on Joey&#34;  , I will never forget it.  I go back to see this movie again bc I think that it is wonderfully done. Also I think that the part with the discussion between the Geman soldier Peter from Dussledorf and the English soldier was beatuifully done, so real , so human.  This movie so far,is my favorite movie ever. I can not recommend this movie enough
B0081X8AE6|5.0|I saw Michael Kiwanuka on t.v. and was blown away! After hearing him sing I made a beeline to my computer to purchase this CD!  He has such a good voice and the music and songs are great!  I loved it so much I bought another CD to give as a gift! I recommend to one and all buy this CD straight away!
B0012NO4WO|5.0|It was just as good as i remembered. Lots of action, suspense and drama. I will enjoy looking at this movies again.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is a great book in a great series. I am looking forward to the next movie and book. fits great with other books with the same mythology
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun to play and awesome action and graphics I can't stop playing. I CAN'T GET anything dONE FOR PLAYING SO MUCH
B007NESBK2|5.0|She is amazing. I wish I could have attended one of the concerts. Will watch this video for years to come.
0316228532|5.0|My daughter requested this book as a gift for Christmas. It was a great savings over the cost in the book stores and it arrived promptly.
B0053TMP24|5.0|The move to the Roman gods and the collaboration of the Roman and the Greek demigods is very well done.  It pulled me in like Riordan's other books.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Positives: Unusual setting and the author uses a very creative approach. In the process I learned a lot about North Korea and, to the extent the book mirrors actual life in the DPRK, it presents a frightening Orwellian tragedy. Grusome depictions of life and torture in the labor camps.<br /><br />Negatives: The first section of the book, which reveals background experiences of the main character, is almost unbearably dull. Had I not been reading for my book group, I met never have gotten past it. The narrative frequently meanders and is annoyingly repetitive. The author seems to feel he needs to make the same point over and over again. It picks up considerably about two thirds of the way in, but the ending is just a little too satirical to be believable.
B00000AF98|4.0|I only got this because of the song &#34;reason to live&#34; which is the only good song on this CD that is near impossible to find anywhere
B003G4W49C|1.0|Just an OK read.  The final chapter was a terrible letdown. A few writing classes might help Mr. CARD get over his preachy style
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Disclosure : I'm a jack reacher fan and have read most of the books.<br />It's a good book, and a very decent story. I like lee child's writing and enjoy the stories. It's not a work of art but for what it is , it's great!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Great story, and very well written to make you feel as if you're there.  A great story, even if you're not into war stories.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I like that they have their ups and downs throughout. it's not always getting better in Hope Springs. I also thought it was an interesting choice of therapist. he made the movie a lot funnier than it would have been with any other guy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a great book.  I can't wait to see the movie.  I didn't want to put it down.  Another great book by Mr. Sparks
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really love this game. it is so fun to think that I have my own horse when I live in the city. I love to groom it and feed it.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Horrible. I won't go into details as many of the others who gave it only one star already did. I just wanted to help bring the star ratings down in the hopes that someone else doesn't waste an entire weekend reading this like I did. Wish I would've spent my weekend organizing closets instead!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|subway surfers is a pretty fun game, but I just wish we could buy fresh or get radios more. the game would also be a lot better if there was I was a wider spread path and different stages.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is very good i can't stop playing it good how that have it just want you to play it all t the time vivid game
B0091TGWYE|5.0|I love this case! I fit my driver's license and debit card in the pocket and it works great. I have been able to fully eliminated the need for a wallet! The pocket hasn't stretched out like other reviews have said, never had an issue with the cards falling out.<br />I have received numerous compliments from my friends, I would recommend this case for the price it is unbeatable!
0307474259|5.0|Also read the Paleo Solution by Robb Wolf, then join cross-fit or do Insanity! = feel awesome, look great, live longer!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|As soon as I opened this app I was like&quot; whoa!&quot; It has a lot of songs but it needs Amazing Grace.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I ordered this for my nine year old. She loves it and can play it on her own. She loves Where's My Perry?! and so do I.
B003IHW0GE|5.0|Downloaded this ebook to my wifes kindle and she loved the story. My wife told me she would reccomend Little Women to anyone!
B009WGWRW2|5.0|I am a HUGE Dilbert fan! This calendar is awesome, my co-workers love seeing it and sharing in the laughs as well. I have purchased many Dilbert calendars over the years and it is amazing at how much they can mirror reality.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a challenging but absolutely fun game. Once you start it you can't stop! I guarantee that you will like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS IT IS FUN TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS I LOVE IT IS FUN TO PLAY AT SLEEP OVERS AND FUN TO GET FREE COINS!!:) I love subway SURFERS!:)
0345495004|4.0|I recommended this if you are interested in the life of Frank Lloyd Wright.  The facts are true.  You can see Mamah's in Oak Park, Chicago. And you can see the graves at Taliesin in Wisconsin.
B000I2JI80|5.0|Standard issue film for my Holga. Only problem is finding someone to process it. No one locally.  Have to send it off (Dwayne's).
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Awesome book. Absolutely loved every bit of it. Ten times better then the movie ever could have been. Loved it
B000816TCY|4.0|I have tried generic-brand batteries, and they just don't perform.  I have had them arrive DOA, and had them wear out REALLY fast.  The original Nikon battery is 5-10X as expensive, but at least you can count on it.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|A great keepsake of music from a fabulous movie. I look forward to hearing it many times in the future.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Best game ever play it its fun and stimulates ur brain at the time it's what the title says perfect
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So good. Makes you feel more human. Read it, you won't be disappointed. Even if you aren't dying of cancer.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|What a sneaky mystery!  The Gordonston Ladies almost lost me in the first half of the book.  It wasn't enough for a hit-man to appear in the first chapter, the benign backstories of all the residents were not propelling my interest in the book.  But it's not a long novel, so I kept reading.<br /><br />Then it was like, Hello Wisteria Lane! (For all you Desperate Housewives junkies in need of a fix since the series finale.) Who is not going to get killed?  And we have a page-turner with so many secrets, I love it!  And the ending is priceless.
0547569653|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations. Great story. Great gift for the person in your life who is into extreme running.
B0001CNRBG|4.0|It was fun to see the changes as it went through the decades-----she went with the changes and he stayed about the same.  Especially liked her hippy days.
0307960471|5.0|Phantom, by Jo Nesbo, is the second book in the detective Harry Hole series that I've read, and both have turned me into a Joe Nesbo fan.  These are literate and complicated tales centered in Oslo, which involve untypical people in believable plots.  Nesbo is a master at laying down clues and bringing them together in surprising ways, so that the conclusion is logical, but not obvious.  The atmosphere is dark, but realistic.  Although the pace is measured, the sense of moving forward is never lost.  If there are better detective stories being written today, I don't know what they are.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is another winner from G5!  It's simple and a good one for a beginner who might like to try total immersion in the genre of hidden objects games. No tricky moves, no misdirection, a minimum options of directions and a guide, so you can't get lost or grind to an untimely halt. And, make no mistake, this game is ALL ABOUT THE HO SCENES. The \\"story\\" is an afterthought. The graphics are very, very good and the ho scenes are NUMEROUS and chocked full of stuff - like if you went to the nearest dumpster and dove in. But, the items are all there and when you pinch to zoom, you can see them all, even those rare ones that hide under the inventory bar at the bottom. Luckily, the Hints are impeccable and work every time. And, I had to use them more than once, I'm ashamed to say. I spent hours on these hos! They're really, really good. The only thing I prefer about Big Fish Games is that their ho objects usually relate to the story and are of that period. No matter, this is a ho lover's dream game with PLENTY of play (yes, I upgraded and it was soooooo worth it)!!!!<br /><br />The somewhat lean story is macabre, but interesting, about Amazonian curses, jewels and a missing girl. I love ho games and I found this very challenging. For all you ho junkies, this is a great one for you! This played flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\". If you leave it and restart it, when the game starts playing from the beginning, press the back arrow and it will take you right where you were when you stopped the last time. VERY, VERY GOOD GAME! Support our game developers so we can have more like these!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You have to download minecraft pocket edition. It is the best thing since sliced bread!!!!! But enough sliced bread, download the game already!!!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this for my Smith and Wesson open assist knife. I have used it to sharpen that along with my butchers knife I use on a regular basis. Handles big and small blades. I even sharpened the little baldes on my small chopping machine.
B009ZQGNPQ|1.0|Just watched the final episode of Season 3. It sucks eggs--big time--and and casts a pall over  the entire season. I find in its aftermath that I'm not especially interested to see what happens next. A big dramatic turn that in my opinion is wholly unnecessary and serves to kill one's interest rather than pique it.
0316098515|5.0|I read it like the bible of food. Get more and more ideas. This book is a piece of art.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Loved this book.  I enjoy doing geneology and from the very start to end I couldn't put the book down.
0316056863|3.0|I bought this book for my husband as a Christmas gift, and he read it quickly, because he loves Tina Fey's show, &#34;30 Rock.&#34;  I guess you have to have a certain sense of humor to enjoy her comedy, and I just don't.  My husband very much enjoyed this book, and I thought it was very so-so.  A few funny parts, but overall a miss for me.
B00BESM14U|2.0|casting is cute, script is bad, direction is bad, looks like someone's first film. all of the lines that are supposed to be \\"deep\\" land with a huge thud. or a groan.  watching this made me glad I grew up.  the book managed to be charming and sweet, for some reason the film translation just didn't work.  logan lerman is adorable though.
0307592731|1.0|I started reading this book and the first part was hard to get through.  She is mourning the loss of her mother, and gives graphic details of her mothers death due to cancer.  I got through that part, and continued  on with the book.  Her mother was an a horse lover and had a horse for many years who was her love.  Half way through the book, she tells of going to visit the horse........whom was abandoned (left to die alone out in the freezing cold with no one to care for it.  She then goes on to tell how she tortured the horse, and shot the horse, not in a humanly way<br />I could barely continue to read this part.<br />I really wondered why if she loved her mother so much why didn't she care for the horse.  Why didn't she honor her mother by caring for  an animal that meant the world to her mother.<br />I then realized that she is using this book as a dumping grounds for her guilt for what a mess she made of her life.<br />I cant finish the book, because anyone that treats animals so cruelty, and cant honor her mother does not deserve to have her words read.<br />Very disappointed in the book, and don't understand why Opera, who is an animal lover would stand behind this book which involve animal cruelty at its best.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Considered tame by today standards, but is very chilling and delivers without all the gore that today's movies seem to need.
B004DK5CW4|4.0|It's a movie and it moves as it should. Received at decent price. Seven more words required one two three
B0091LS07E|3.0|The intro and Brand New Me are the standout tracks on a rather dull offering from Ms. Alicia Keys. This album was highly anticipated by many, but does not deliver. I have played it at least 10 times hoping it will take shape, but it fails. Fortunately the best tracks are at the beginning, then you can switch it off. Will not go down in history as a classic album, that's for sure.
B0095P33IW|3.0|I was hoping this would be better than Thor, but it wasn't. I think the whole movie seemed rushed. They pushed through the plot to get the character into Avengers.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This book is amazing especially for the  first book of the series so much action and drama I just love it
B009VLX8FS|3.0|Well I heard this on the radio and loved it along with my daughter. I don't like the video at all, but the song is light, and fun, not too deep!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I find it rather hard these days to really enjoy a book.  This book brought me back to the world of  mystery and magic.  While intense situations are occurring there is a lot of comic relief through the character of Oberon.  It's not the cheesy comic relief either.  It's meaningful and not only is funny but shows the bonds close friends share.  Within the book you can also find truths that can apply to your life as well.  Mr. Hearne,  Thank you.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|The cast should have been able to deliver a great movie. Movie was basically about a out of control drug user that did one good thing in his life and messed it up. Don't have to watch a movie to see that stuff these days :(
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|So much fun.it's makes me laugh when I hear the pigs making the noises...they smile at you though when you don't beat the level.like they are mocking you...lol
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Enjoyable but not the typical Pendergrass novel. Too many outside coincidences that kept the story going as opposed to the main character solving the puzzle.
0060930349|4.0|The review title says it. Huge topic and compact product. High school history texts, written by or for review committees, cover topics of huge historical significance with a sentence. This book avoids that but it is till bodacious in scope and adequate in coverage.
B008Q0CO0U|4.0|Every time I watch this movie it keeps me interested. It has a good balance of plot to action. Overall it isn't fully realistic, but that is why it isn't a documentary.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a fun and loving game especially for horse lovers it's especially fun for young kids it teaches them how to raise and take care for their own pets.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|It is the best, most positive movie I have seen in years. When it comes to &#34;How bad do you want it?&#34; You will totally understand what that questions means when you see Secretariat.<br />In addition the cinematography is superb, the editing is fabulous and the music is perfect and the acting is all of the above.<br />It is my &#34;feel good movie&#34; of all time. I can't tell you how many times I have watched it and it moves me to tears every time I do.
B000VDDDVO|3.0|I bought it for Xmas, but I found the movie very slow. It was not, for my taste, what I expected. I did not finish watching it at that moment.
0399160450|5.0|Husband and son can't put his books down and they eagerly await his books and get them as soon as they come on the market.<br />This one has a complicated and thrilling slant to it.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I've been a fan of Behringer's products, and the HA400 doesn't disappoint.  Just needed a cheap single channel amp to amplify a signal out of a mixer, and this does the job.  Although, if you're looking for something a little beefier and can afford the extra $40, look at the Behringer AMP800.  The AMP800 supports two separate stereo channels, with the ability to direct each channel to 4 separate outputs.  The outputs seem a lot more stable on the AMP800 than the HA400 as well.  But for the price, the HA400 does what is needed of it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Perfect.  This fit the iphone 4S and functions great.  The only small issue is that not all chargers for the iphone will fit is the opening provided in the case.  The true apple ones will be generic ones won't.
B0086700CM|4.0|amazing and addictive!! love it!! (Ps this is random but: MARF!) but I wish I could play it laying down or at an angle...
B003JOA0U4|1.0|The drive had always been on the slow side... but not the slowest I've used. A month into using it, the drive randomly blue-screens one of my computers. Twice, over the next few months, it randomly became corrupted and needed to be reformatted. Then it simply died and would not be recognized by any of the 7 computers I've tried it on. I'm not sure if it's worth the cost to ship the drive in for repairs... but I might go through the RMA process and see how customer service is and decide then.<br /><br />Loved the form factor at first even though the spring clip needed to be a bit more tense. Over time the swinging connector itself got loose and would not stay in the closed position.<br /><br />Due to the drives instability, I never stored much on it for long. I mostly used it to transfer files from one computer to another. Because of the slow write speed, however, it wasn't even the best for that job.<br /><br />It had been years since I've purchased anything from ADATA. I would probably wait a few more before I try them again.<br /><br />Giving it one star seems harsh, but honestly I cannot recommend this product to anyone.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Like it but hate buying the extra credits, Lots of extra buildings and products and environmental stuff. A great time waster.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Been wanting to read this for sometime...ready to start the next one.  I am sure it will be good also!  Thanks to all for the new kindle for Christmas
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you have bought the free version time to upgrade to the HD version. Best for spending your time when waiting for a person (mom/wife/etc). More updates to the level would be appreciated.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|The grandchildren love these Dr. Panda games and I think they are super-cute!  They are fun and educational for the toddlers.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very interesting. I liked how it moved from the 1940s back to 2011 . The mystery held your interest and played out just as if you were the one trying to solve the Secret.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I loved the maze runner until the last chapter. And then as I read the other two books in the trilogy I kept waiting for the answers to all the madness and was very disappointed in the end of Death Cure when they didn't come.<br /><br />However Dashner pulled out all the stops in this prequel. Lots of action, drama, and tons of answers. Now I have to go back and read Death Cure again to put everything together. I liked this as much or better than Maze Runner. Well done Dashner.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|its awesome but they don't let you wake up to ur music u have to get the full version......  D:
B00973902K|2.0|Video is better than the song is. Personally I think she is better with Owl City. This is a stupid song and what is with the album cover straight from the 80s?
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I truly love the music that IS on this album. I would give it 5 stars for that. But 3 stars since they left out SO MUCH great music from the film.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. It is so fun and it is so addicting. You will love thisgame if you like a challenge and a race than you will love this game so much. You can never get enough.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Really like the sound of this band.  Am looking forward to future CDs from them. They are really awesome, yeah!
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|My kids and I watched it together. They loved it. This was my 3rd time watching this movie. Will probably watch it again.
B008476HBM|5.0|Wonderful! It had been 30 years since I first read Pride and Prejudice.  I have in recent years gotten into reading the P&P variations and I love them.  Nothing beats the original though.
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|I bought this movie because I thought it would another one of Denzel's suspenseful gripping movies that had u on the edge of your seat  but much to my disappointment after the first 10 min of suspense in the airplane the plot took a nose dive centering on drug addicts and alcoholics  First Denzel movie I ever fast forwarded just to get it over with.  So sorry I actually bought it
B00846F1YW|5.0|Great game to play. I love the story line that goes with it. It's a mystery story and game, all in one, that unfolds as you go through the levels.
0802473156|5.0|You learn a lot ,I like this book..Your marriage can be heal and you can choose the right person before marriage
B00846F1YW|5.0|So, it seems as if this entire game is free. I hate getting into a good 'free' game, only to have to pay to play the rest of it. My only qualm with this game is that the dialogue is a bit much. My eyes get tired from reading so much, so I have to skip over it. It would be nice if the dialogue was spoken aloud, like most other games.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|Prior to getting this my son would bring his big huge box of Legos with him when ever he could, now he can bring this with him, it makes life easier when you don't want to bring everything but still want the entertainment!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|If you love the card game you will love the kindle version.  Greast twist on different versions of the UNO game.  Addicting once you start playing
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game is awesome get it<br />I always been waiting for it to come out and here it is I recommend game because its so fun and awesome and there is a version for the computer too at<br />ninjakiwi.com
B008TMA1LY|5.0|it was a great came I think it takes to long to build up the tokens<br />so you mite like to play
B006R6ZP6U|5.0|I ordered this as a replacement for friends who lost the original in a house fire.  I had it delivered straight to their house.  It was PERFECT!  And this was the ONLY place I could find it! Thank you!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ive been waiting for the update to come out and here it is this game is so awesome I recommend this game to any one who like adventure games!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a great app, especially for the price.  I like to watch videos while on breaks at work.  I just set the alarm, and it will stop my movie when it goes off.  It even works if you're kindle fire is shut off.  Nothing bad, all good!
B0097S0TM0|5.0|I've always loved PINK.  She's amazing and gifted!  It's on my phone, and I listen to it daily!  Thank you tons!
B003TZ9EGO|1.0|if you think you get Gaga here, you are right, lots of Gaga but no lady, forget this, this is fake
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Not as user friendly as on the desk top computer in the den, but for travel or a quick peek at what's going on its quite satisfactory
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The approach is definitely unique, which is why I gave it three stars. I personally did not like that the book described the zombie war in a generalized recalling of events. I prefer my zombie action to be much more \\"in your face\\" - the feeling of being right there with the characters with a well-written zombie tale was woefully missing from this one. I'm also pretty disappointed the publisher makes you pay so much to find this out. I won't be recommending this one to friends.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. Very fun and addicting. I would have paid for this app if I could have and would have known about it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I liked the relationship between the lead characters. I thought it was interesting for the most part. I expected more of a plot twist and did not really care for the ending.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Hard to top my comments on season two, but I'll try. We are limiting ourselves to two episodes a night to stretch out our enjoyment. Honestly there is hardly anything on TV any more to watch without getting slightly ill, so this is a great find.  Interesting, great characters, drama, love stories, historic, comedy, clean cut what more can you ask for?
0307592731|5.0|Loved it! A very interesting and inspiring memoir. Kept my interest all the way through. A great book club pick.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Percy Jackson books are awsome. I like to read a lot and it was cheap . It was like 4.99
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I started watching on Netflix and were so hooked we had to buy season two.  Unfortunately missed the start of season 3 so we bought it for our Valentine gift, we love it that much.  You get so involved with the characters that you feel you know them,.  Except for a few little scenes, nothing real bad, the show is clean and a great relief from the crap on TV today. Had quite a few laughs wi the antics of Maggie Smith!
B004I744AS|5.0|love it'! Hey interesting and informative.  I look at it every day.  I never know the words in the guessing game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game fun to play my granddaughter and I won't stop playing it. Graphs are nice and simple to use its a nice job done.
0670022411|5.0|A perfect blend of magic, science, romance and mystery. Brilliantly written. Can't wait to read the rest of the All Souls novels.
0345803507|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 of these books and hope for a fourth. It is well written and you get lost in it while reading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So much fun. Can't stop.  Awesome!!!!!!!!!!! Best ever!!!!!! Me and my bro love it. You have to get it to believe it.

B0028MBKVG|3.0|I learned a few things about running in this book. I am not ultra-runner and reading about a group of people running their life into it seems like a religion. All of them can run 30,50,100 of miles like I would drive a car. This looks unrealistic but I guess achievable if you are obsessed with it.<br /><br />I do believe running is good for health but ultra running is a whole different state of mind. Running for a day is not pleasure unless you are masochist.

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|The first time I heard the name Bruno Mars when at a summer pride festival when a local band in my area called The Blast Addicts did a version of his song &#34;The Lazy Song&#34;. I'd seen this album around but paid it little attention. Over time I've had more exposure to his young hipster attitude and his inspired state show,I began to realize this might just be a talent worth exploring. It's been a very long time since I heard an artist whose songs were inspiring interpretation so early in the game. While references to him as &#34;the new Michael Jackson&#34; were a complete turn off at first,considering how few artists will ever likely live up to a vibrant talent on the level of MJ again, But what was this man going to have to say on his own terms?<br /><br />  The first two songs on this album &#34;Grenade&#34; and &#34;Just The Way You Are&#34; do in fact possess that epic production sound so common today,however the pop-soul song craft of the compositions themselves are really quite amazing. My personal favorite track here is the slinky funk/reggae of &#34;Our First Time&#34;,with it's beautifully jazzy chord changes.&#34;Runaway Baby&#34; is a high octane,guitar based funk rocker where &#34;The Lazy Song&#34; pulls pop,soul,funk and light hip-hop rhtyhms together for a song celebrating the sometimes slacker spirit of youth. The same impulse carries on into the sparse new wave style &#34;Marry You&#34;,though this time seeking a commitment through naivety.  &#34;Talking To The Moon&#34; is a moody,reflective piano based ballad.<br /><br />  Damian Marley shows up for the heavy reverbed reggae of &#34;Liquor Store Blues&#34;,an ode to drowning sorrows where &#34;Count On Me&#34; is a sweet little acoustic based song with a strong Caribbean flavor. The ending finds Mars as a soul man supreme on the heavily Stax inspired &#34;The Other Side&#34; recorded,of course with Cee Lo Green. Brimming with youthful charm and innocence this singer/songwriter/musician also shows great potential for a significant,long term creative expansion as he grows artistically. He puts a great deal of thought into his writing and his musical ideas. And while it's clear he operates on many levels firmly within the contemporary musical idiom,his basic musical flavors come out of 60's and 70's sunshine pop melodies-through the filters of the soul,funk and reggae music he clearly loves. Probably the idea pop album for this particular time period.hows great potential for a significant,long term creative expansion as he grows artistically.

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars made quite a splash a few years back when his debut [[ASIN:B003ZJ0ZX0 Doo - Wops & Hooligans]] seemed to arrive out of nowhere to became the summer hit of 2010. Because of his popularity he started to get noticed a bit more. Therefore he was in a position to express himself musically in a much more significant way and reach an even wider audience than all the attention he'd attracted on his first time out. Of course Bruno Mars clearly has a style of his own. It's pretty commercially viable to begin with. But I don't think he ever had any intention of bumping that quality of his art up even more so just for the money. Being that he is one of those DIY sort of artists it makes it a bit easier for him to be able to bring his persona to life for people. His approach to his career seems less like a job and more like a sport to him in some ways. On the other hand that never detracts from the musical vision that is clearly right before his eyes each time he is about to write,sing,play and record a new song.<br /><br />  \\"Young Girls\\" opens the album with an intro that basically keeps on going. \\"Locked Out Of Heaven\\" gets an early Police vibe blended with a chorus showcasing that big modern production sound. \\"Gorilla\\" is a pounding,sexual,beat heavy and uniquely funky number which,as another character in the lyrics,is the main source of the CD's Tipper sticker. \\"Treasure\\" and \\"Moonshine\\" are my favorite numbers here. The first displays a strong command of bass/guitar centered late 70's dance/funk straight out of the [[ASIN:B00005QGAT Off the Wall]] school and the other has a sassy lyric married to a more naked funk/synth pop style production. \\"When I Was Your Man\\" is a touching soul piano ballad showcasing Bruno coming to terms with romantic maturity. \\"Natalie\\" actually takes on a stunning afro pop type hand clap powered rhythm of a similar lyrical impulse. \\"Show Me\\" is a wonderfully melodic slow pop-reggae type number where the rhythmically intense modern funk of \\"Money Make Her Smile\\" flips romantic selfishness on the other side of the coin as the awe inspiring Memphis style soul ballad \\"If I Knew\\" closes the whole affair.<br /><br />  When I first heard Bruno Mars's music,it had a quality about it I couldn't quite put an explanation to. And it seems Bruno himself is not very keen on explaining what he does in interviews either. Actually that in itself emphasizes what that quality about Bruno Mars is that doesn't necessarily require definition. What it amounts to is that quality that Otis Redding,James Brown,Wilson Picket,Al Green,Stevie Wonder and Michael Jackson all based their entire musical vision on: the purest base expression of human emotion-whether it be love,joy,hurt,sadness or regret. Bruno Mars has grown a great deal from his debut to this album-both lyrically and musically. Even on each song there's the sense he's on a journey learning a little bit more about himself creatively and adapting to the musical changes he's going through along the way. Even though this a fantastic album through and through,that growth process is by no means complete. And I'm sure Bruno would happily admit that freely. But that's the exciting thing. The fact that his music,already wonderful,is still poised to blossom into it's full flower.f \\"Money Make Her Smile\\" flips romantic selfishness on the other side of the coin as the awe inspiring Memphis style soul ballad \\"If I Knew\\" closes the whole affair.<br /><br />  When I first heard Bruno Mars's music,it had a quality about it I couldn't quite put an explanation to.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved this book. It had lots of emotional ups and downs. *HUGE SPOILERS* In Beautiful Darkness, Lena is having a huge emotional downfall, and while Ethan tries to comfort her, she begins to pull away. From there on, Ethan and Lena fall apart. I got very sad at all this. Lena ends up running off with Ridley and a different guy, because she fears she is turning dark. Mean while, Ethan, Link, and Liv go after her and Ethan begins to fall for Liv. If you want to find out what happens, read this book ;*)

The Nolan films are terrific and much of that material was sourced from this. Frank Miller is the father of the modern Bat, plain and simple. Watch it.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Movie had a good feel to it and was enjoyable to watch.  I felt so bad for Charlie throughout the film.  Emma Watson is beautiful, but she is not so great with hiding her accent.<br /><br />The Good:  Enjoyable movie<br /><br />The Bad:  some of the acting was so-so<br /><br />Overall: Enjoyed it and will watch it again later on..
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is very fun to be able to play wiyh alot of diff people at one time is awesome
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|Seriously, this movie had some major dead spots!!  30-40 minutes could have been trimmed off this movie and it would have improved my opinion - big time.  As always Dezel Washington's acting was spot on as I could not stand his character in this movie, but it just dragged on and on.<br /><br />So to cut this short..<br /><br />The Good:  Great acting<br /><br />The Bad: Way too many dragging moments in this film and the whole grimy feel of it was not pleasing.<br /><br />Overall:  Did not care for it...
B003102JDM|3.0|A Serious Man is a supposed dark comedy film written and directed by the Coen Brothers. I'll admit, it didn't interest me that much, I found it quite boring, mostly because I didn't understand the point behind it. I liked the main character Larry though, he was very sympathetic and oddly likable. This film apparently was too complex for me, and I rarely laughed, but overall it was okay. It seemed like it could have gone in many different directions but stayed on one narrow track. The ending scene was very ominous and almost frightening. 3 stars
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it!!! This book has been reviewed enough, so please feel free to read everyone else's opinions. And read the book.
B0058ZPNOK|3.0|Hesher is a dark comedy/drama film co-written and directed by Spencer Susser and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the titular character and Devin Brochu as TJ and Rainn Wilson as his father Paul. I'll admit I neither hated nor loved this film, but I definitely leaned more towards hated it. It felt so dark and disturbing at times, especially towards the end when TJ starts to lose it, that it took away from alot of the darkly funny humor of the first half of the film. I felt I would have liked Hesher more if it had been a straight black comedy, rather than a comedy/drama as it turned out to be. All of the right ingredients were there, vulgar nihilistic loner Hesher forcing his way into the lives of a depressed father and his grieving bullied son. However, instead of sticking to the comedy that kept this film from being too dark and depressing, it abandoned that formula towards the middle and degraded itself into rather bleak drama, and the attempts at humor toward the end felt pathetic, lazy, and unfunny. I'll admit there was a somewhat touching moment towards the end involving a coffin, but truth be told, despite being funny and entertaining (atleast in the beginning) this film felt almost pointless. What was the point of the Hesher character, was he there to improve the lives of TJ's family or destroy what little happiness there was left. Based on the way the film progressed it would seem as if he improved their lives, but there doesn't seem to be any particular reason why things got better all of sudden, especially in the last few scenes. Yes, this film has a somewhat happy ending, which again kept this film from a lower rating, but it could have been alot better. Also, I thoroughly enjoyed Natalie Portman's character, and if this film was a straight comedy, it would actually be her character that would bring the quality of the film from a 4 star rating to a 5 star. Hesher, though oddly likable, was a bit of an prick at times, and not the sort of person I would want to meet in real life.t to meet in real life.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Pretty helpful, but not exactly what I thought it would be. It's pretty confusing writing over a calendar, but I haven't spent much time on it so I could be doing something wrong.
0345803485|3.0|just thought the way people talked the book up so much it would have taken a bit shorter time before it become more interesting. To me it didnt strike my fancy till like chapter 8...alll and all it's still a good read....

0783219695|5.0|This film is about as good as they get.  It makes a great companion to The Right Stuff in any DVD collection.  Tom Hanks is at his finest.  Gary Sinise is wonderful and Bill Paxton plays his best character to date.  Kevin Bacon is great as well.  You feel like you're watching a fascinating inside look at NASA and the filming is incredible.  Wonderful film on all levels.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Needed a better scene of Cloris coming out of the hot tube..Way to brief...Not a bad movie by any means..
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I purchased this simply because I own all of the Alien films and I must say it wasn't quite what I expected.  Originally it was intended to be a prequel to Alien, but Ridley Scott decided to make it a stand alone film.  It didn't stand very well.  It was interesting but not enough to rate it on par with Alien and Aliens.  Good try but probably should've stayed with the original plan.  It would have been more interesting as a prequel.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|A spicy new edge, more poppy than country but still the same great voice. Seems like a more Avril sound, you can be the judge.

B003UYV08E|5.0|This sequal provided more action, more adventure, more Iron Man, and more suits. Not to mention many more enimies and a new peek into the Avengers.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|For one who has not read the graphic novel, I was pleasantly surprised by this story; I loved it.  The animation was very good, with nice clean lines and some beautiful &#34;3-D&#34; work.  For me one of the highlights was seeing Batman and The Kryptonian go toe to toe.  It was awesome! And don't get me started on the new Robin.  Carrie Kelly rocks!  The voice work was excellent (this was the 1st time I didn't actively miss Conroy's voice)! I've no complaints here.; this was an outstanding Return!
B004LWZW42|5.0|Go back to the begining of the X-men, see the Hellfire club forming, and see many new characters not seen in the Previous movie and see where Professor X and Magneto met and went their seperate ways,

Please be aware that after you score the bottle (that part is pretty easy) you have to immerse it in hot then cold water over and over until it pops apart. It doesn't always break on the score if it's not deep enough. Large bottles are hard to find a large enough container for the hot and cold water.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This takes severel movies and combines them into one action packed movie. The vilian need to be more than just formed aainst one of the charaters but I think overall it was a good development.

B004P8JPS6|5.0|This book answers a lot of the questions about Reacher's past and what led him to leave his military career.  There is a lot to figure out in the plot, but Lee Child, as usual, kept me on the edge of my seat.

B004P52NP6|4.0|In the late 80s, David Coverdale reinvented Whitesnake from their earlier, bluesy roots of the Moody/Marsden era, going for a more hair-metal direction with the self-titled 1987 \\"Whitesnake\\" hit album.  The guitars were flashier, the croony vocal style was replaced with a Robert Plant-influenced scream, and the lineup would be pretty much overhauled every album.  Except, after that there was only one album (\\"Slip of the Tongue\\" in 1989, I think) and we didn't hear of the band in America for about a decade and a half.  Then, Coverdale returned with a new lineup and the fantastic \\"Good To Be Bad\\" album - the sound was similar to that late 80s sound, except the guitars were less flashy and more heavy;  that album totally rocked!  Now, comes \\"Forevermore\\" - other reviewers have called it a return to the early, bluesy days but I don't hear that at all.  It's mostly the same lineup as \\"Good To Be Bad\\", and pretty similar in sound (which is to say, pretty much in that late-80s hard rock/glam metal style).  The main difference is, the guitars aren't as heavy as the previous album and there's quite a few mellower tracks (particularly in the middle), but they certainly don't remind me of the late-70s/early-80s Coverdale/Whitesnake sound.  That said, much of the album rocks pretty well, and the songs that don't are decent (it's just not as good as \\"Good To Be Bad\\").  After Coverdale cut short his tour due to vocal problems (I was at the show in Denver where he walked off stage after 4 songs), I was worried his voice would've suffered.  Not at all - he sounds great!  Again, it's his later vocal style, like the 1987 album, not his earlier style, but he sings a lot better here (and on \\"Good To Be Bad\\") than he does on \\"Slip of the Tongue\\" or the Coverdale/Page album (his voice sounded pretty shot on that one, but it's still a good album) - his vocals have held up a lot better than many another 80s singer (Ozzy, Dickinson, David Lee Roth, etc. just don't sound like they used to).<br />  So, if you like later Whitesnake or that late 80s hard rock sound, this is a good one.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The only reason I gave this book five stars is because there aren't any more to give. That doesn't mean it doesn't deserve more, though. Trust me, this isn't your usual boy-meets-girl, love-conquers-all story. It's more along the lines of a rip-your-heart-out-of-your-chest kinda tale, where a quadriplegic who has lost his will to live is cared for by a young lady who is determined to make his life worth living again... before it's too late. Neither of them expects to fall in love, but the question is: will love be enough?

I was down in the dark and the stunning performances by Lerman, Watson, and Miller gave me a new life.  But I knew, as I'd known for a long time, that I had to read the book.  As soon as I finished it, I wanted to read it again.  Charlie is the sweetest, most and least broken character I've read, and also one of the truest.  Everyone has been him at some point, but there's also so much more that makes him an individual rather than a universal.  The plot is diary-like, the writing dreamlike and painting-beautiful.  It leaves you feeling like you've been punched in the gut, and somehow light and floating at the same time.  Perfect.    plot . 5/5  If you want all the answers, you'll be disappointed.  There are many gaps.  Many unsung scenes.  It's written as a diary in letters, which means that we see everything after-the-fact.  The ending is abrupt but perfect, and the pacing is great.  I'm having a hard time describing it without saying \\"great.\\"  The events alternate between serious, highschool normal, and even a little whimsical.  Symbols are woven in with such subtlety that you can read deep if you want or simply enjoy the ride and let them sink in.  It's like reading someone's brain, or living it.    concept . 5/5  Salinger already took the angsty teen crown, and you could say that Goethe did it even longer before.  That doesn't mean that Chbosky doesn't make it new.  His is one of the best explorations of mental illness out there, on par with Girl, Interrupted, with an authenticity and a voice that few authors can claim.  The diary in letters is certainly new.  Charlie writes to an unknown person whose identity is never revealed.  We don't know what this person thinks of the letters.  How they're involved.  How we would react to receive such letters.  And it also reveals so much about Charlie's character and his desire for closeness that he would write his diary to another person instead of an invisible other.  This theme permeates the story.  Everyone is looking for love--the lasting, true kind, that seems so hard to find.    characters . 5/5  Of course Charlie steals the show.  He's part a child, part a wise old man, longing for connections that he just can't seem to find.  He reminds you of that part of you back in middle school when you were dorky and bespectacled and just wanted a friend.  (Or was that just me?)  But he's by no means the only star of the show.  Sam and Patrick are real in their own right.  Sam is a foil to Charlie's sister, a wise mentor and also a scared girl looking for a love she doesn't feel worthy of.  Patrick is at once a trailblazer and a scared little boy.  The other characters get less screen time, but they're no less real for it.  There are worlds in each of their heads that you could jump into if you wanted, and seeing them through Charlie's sympathetic eyes, we find new facets that even they might never see in themselves.    style . 5/5  I could quote every line, turn it into a song or an inspiration wall art.  Actually I did that already.  But basically, it's beautiful.  Charlie's voice, first person, has the wisdom of a poet, the beauty of a painting, and an innocence that is childlike, refreshing, and allows you to see the world in ways you never thought you could.    mechanics . 5/5  Could I possibly complain?  Everything is perfect.  As I mentioned, the diary-letter format is brilliant.  Are you sick of me gushing yet?  Go read it!    take home message  A letter from the mind of a troubled teen to all the insecurities, the ones you know and the ones you never knew you had.
B001TH44VY|5.0|This movie is a great glimpse of Europe at its best. The time is one of the most interesting in history.
B005PK56TA|1.0|This Series started out really cool. If your a thesbian, progressive liberal like my sister who recomended this to me then you will probably like it passed the first few episodes. There is just too much BS in the series and though I'm not a homophobe there just seems to be too many gay love scenes on TV these days and this series is no exception. Sorry if this point of veiw may offend some of those reading this review but hey I'm entitled to my opinion too. Get over it.
B005UG53NS|3.0|Yes I have read all the books and seen all the movies so Harry Potter got their money from me. The ending got it done. I think we could have cut a lot of movie from the three before this though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the BEST game ever it has survival and creative its amazing survival is hard!! and creative is amazing it has new blocks! I think its worth $7 get it best game ever!! :)
B002RKSCA6|3.0|Once you read this it is with you forever. It changes how one looks at themselves and the world. It is a classic.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was mute, the story is a story that every parent of a daughter can identify with.  We protect our own, I just wish in life I had some of the fathers resources.
B00470TOV0|5.0|Moves fast and has a philosopher king in it. I love this movie. I would watch it any time any where.
0375869026|5.0|One of the best books I've read in the past year. This is my favorite kind of novel--a kid that I like (even though he has flaws) battling huge obstacles. Auggie is going to regular school for the first time, having been home-schooled up through 4th grade. He has a severe facial deformity, so you can sort of imagine what he's up against. And he faces all of it, not with a fake bravery, but with a vulnerable spirit that makes you want to wave a magic wand and make everything better. But of course you can't.<br /><br />One of the things I really love is that the pov changes throughout the novel. We start with Auggie and get to know him really well, but then the viewpoint changes to his older sister. A range of other kids, both Auggie's age and high school age as well, take their turns as viewpoint characters, which is really cool. In real life, the kid with the difference, the special need, the disease, whatever--that kid gets all the attention (good and bad) in a family, in society. But whatever affects one of us affects everyone close to that person.<br /><br />I think every kid should read this novel, and there aren't many books I feel that way about! I finished it feeling uplifted and inspired, and trusting that most people really are good at heart (yes, it made me feel a bit Anne Frankish). And the people that aren't--the jerks and bullies who just aren't going to change--well, forget them. They will always be there, and they don't deserve your energy.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|well this game is good in all but it takes about ten days for it to load and get to the main page plus an extra hour for it to get the game ready
B00B2V66VS|4.0|When I first got it it was awsome. But then it did'nt. work.  so then my Mommy undownloaded the game and downloaded it back.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app because it allowed me to read the books from my Kindle to my Android and at the time I purchased my tablet there was no Kindle Fire.
0740785508|5.0|A great look at how to create art for any one interested in art and illustration for graphics artists or any one just interested in the how to of great illustration.
B001EBV0OY|4.0|Enjoy watching it. Love how it ends. My husband and I enjoy watching frequently. Enjoy debating the morality points to confronts.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great final book of the Hunger Games.  The writing is a page turner and you do not want to put the book down
B003UESJHY|5.0|I ordered this product used, through a third-party on Amazon.  The special editions DVD did not work at all and the blu-ray skipped.  Originally, I was upset for receiving a defective product.  Upon requesting a return however, I was contacted by the seller.  He/she offered to assist me in the return and apologized for the inconvenience.  I was given a refund with no problems what so ever.  This is a great and honest person to buy from.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazing. The one word that describes this app. If you love Minecraft GET THIS! Its even better with this update Skies!!! And other stuff. Cant wait for 0.7.0.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really fun and addictive. I love this game. It's kind of a copy of Temple Run though... lol. But it's like my favorite app on my kindle. :)
B0034G4P1W|4.0|A group of pirates just can't seem to get a break.  They have to rely on each other for support.  Then they meet a rather dastardly Charles Darwin, who is having trouble catching a break himself.  He gets them into even more trouble before they all work together to save their hides.  Not at all historically accurate, so make sure the kids know this or you might have some seriously flawed class assignments.  It is a fun movie.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Love this game!  I love Atlantis too. I hope they make another matching game with a book or mythological theme someday. I will.probably be obsessed with that too.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was following the steps to see if this case worked and thankfully I did that.  Water immediately came in through the camera lens area.  When I called LifeProof about it, they asked me a few questions which identified that this case is a counterfeit case and not their true product.  I won't reveal what the questions were as I don't want to give any information to the counterfeiters to help them make the product harder to identify.  Suffice it to say, I'm thankful I tested the case before putting my phone in it as it would not have protected my phone at all!  So, the questions remain…does the seller know they have a counterfeit product that they are selling or are they a victim as well?  The LifeProof representative suggested I return the item where I purchased it or contact my credit card company and report it as a fraudulent purchase.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon about this product to return it.  In actuality, I'm 2 weeks too late to get a refund.  But when I explained the situation to the representative, she put me on hold to see what she could do and came back with authorization to return the item and get a complete refund on it.  While it is concerning that Amazon has no way of knowing if their sellers are offering legitimate products or not, I am very satisfied knowing that they allowed my return even after their expiration date for return as stated on my order.  They have provided me with a return label so there is no cost to me for my return.  Basically both Amazon and I got hosed on this one (and potentially the seller if they didn't know they had a counterfeit product).  Kudos to Amazon for representing their company well and doing the right thing by me!
B007BDK3SS|2.0|I don't know what happened, but the physics are horrible in the trial x2 and trial x2 winter editions. The First trial Xtreme has the most realistic physics, why screw it up? Then Trial X 3 came out. In my opinion, that's the worst one yet. They keep getting worse instead of better. I don't know what's wrong with this developer, but why not use the same physics engine as the first game, instead of making the bike act so goofy? I still play Trial Xtreme 1 primarily because I just get so frustrated with the stupid physics of the other versions, like not being able to keep the front tire on the ground while accellerating, or trying to climb a hill without flipping. It's fine to try to get through the real obstacles in the game, but when you have a problem just getting the bike to the obstacles, that's where I draw the line. also, there are times when the bike does even have enough power to climb the hill (or obstacle) from a dead start. All of these things where never an issue in the first version. The graphics are even better in the first version than they are in the rest of them. Games are supposed to get better from version to version. Not this time. Basically, the way I see it, Version one is a flat out pleasure to play. The rest of them are just nothing more than paying money for loads of serious aggravation!
B0027MJU00|5.0|She is such a great writer, I never see the twists coming.  This book is one of my new favorites!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Threat Vector includes Jack Ryan in the background making the tough calls and Jack Ryan Jr. out there doing it in the field. Threat Vector has plenty of covert action John Clark style and something to think about as cyber-war comes to the forefront.  With the Chinese applying their well developed strength in system hacking and at the same time, stirring it up with traditional war making in the South China Sea, it leaves one to consider the balance of cyber vs. ground, sea and air forces.  Great read in keeping with Tom Clancy signature style.  This is the second book in his series written with Mark Greaney and I hope there are more to come!
0765325950|5.0|Not much to say. Great book! I was sad to read the last few words knowing it was the end of a great epic series. And the last of a master story tellers stories. Rest in peace Robert Jordan!
0142501123|4.0|My three year old grandaughter really loves this book.  I think she enjoys it more each time we read it probably because she knows what's coming next.  This is a fun read.
B003YCIE68|4.0|I like the theme,scenery, and actors! I play this movie every year at the Christmas season as it has an interesting story of how Santa Claus was originated to bring joy to all the children of the world!!
B000002KON|5.0|This is a must have for Kinks fans. Listen to it several times and you will be humming the tunes .
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love this app.  I was totally sleep deprived until I got this.  It's so soothing, I sleep like a baby and wake up refreshed.  Thank you for this.app.
B00846F1YW|5.0|This game was fun to play and best of all ran very well on my kindle fire hd. I've played quite a few of these before and they didn't seem like a natural match for this platform, but this one was smooth and the graphics were great. Definitely worth a play if you are using an hd tablet.
1439153663|5.0|Read this for our book club (25 people) all gave good reviews.  Reminicient of &#34;The Help&#34; Different in many ways, but the suffering and torture of persons of color in our country at that time was/is a never healing wound.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is amazing, its so fun there's no stopping the playing so many puzzles just keeps u locked ln the game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was skeptical because of all the hype surrounding it but I was pleasantly surprised. I loved all the characters and the romance between Peeta and Katniss. The movie was even better. I hope the next two are just as good.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|great movie, downloaded from Amazon instant queue and really enjoyed the action packed feature movie.  The best Batman movie ever.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is my preferred solitare game, i have it on an IPAD, and IPOD and now Andoid TV... simple setup and easy to use...
B000002LFZ|5.0|This is truely full of the bands best hits. Amazon delivered it almost overnight and the price was right. I just wish there were more hours in the day to listen to it! This is one of my favorites. Buy it, you wont be dissapointed.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|The subject above says it all.  There's something that feels wrong about being able to design literally, the demise of the world.  But wow, the strategy and open world design is totally addictive.  Replay value is off the charts.  Between choosing the type of plague to picking what country it starts in and then designing how the plague resists the &quot;cure&quot;' how the plague is transmitted and what the symptoms are.  It's a race against time to annihilate the world before a cure is found.  I'd love to see this ported to a zombie scenario.  Great job on this game guys. Great game at a great price.
B008FLYM50|4.0|Wonderful follow up to Marina's first album! The sound is fuller and even more full of heart, this time around. Marina's eye to the realistic aspects of relationships continues to impress. My only gripe with this album is that it feels a bit top heavy. Some of the songs closer to the end aren't quite as dynamic as the ones at the beginning. However, I've suggested this album to many people and continue to spread the word about this amazing artist. She's fantastic!
B008X8QCTO|5.0|I'm already in line for the next one.  It had a good long run, so just when u thought itwas over, it took u somewhere else.  Good graphics and mini games.  wish i could rate it higher.  Comfortably creepy too!  Yummm!
B0035XVVDY|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat.  Could not imagine the ending being so tragic.  I was rooting for justice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|A young friend introduced me to this game on his computer.  I liked it so much that I looked and found the kindle version and it seems to play just like the computer game.  I wish it had more furniture, but u can make do w most of what they have if u use ur imagination.  Great game!  Thank u so much for making a kindle version.
6305558167|3.0|I thought this would be a little more enjoyable but instead I was a little disappointed.  I should have rented it from the library
1449433251|5.0|I couldn't give less than 5 stars to this product, after all it's Calvin & Hobbes, one my preferred things to read in the whole world.<br />But... I don't like their decision to set the books the way they did.<br />They are just so big and heavy, so it's impossible to read in bed, before going to sleep (which would be my favorite time to read those).<br />I was anxious to get them, and now that I have them I haven't started reading them because I don't find the mood to read sitting by a table, so I just end reading something else in bed.<br />I think they could've come up with many other ways to present this collection...<br />I'm glad I bought paperback, or they would be even heavier/clumsier to read.<br />I also wish they sold this for kindle, but they don't...<br />Anyways, I still love the product, and would buy again/recommend, as long as they don't publish it someway more comfortable for holding...
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. Tommie Lee Jones was an old grouch through most of it. Meryl won an academy award for this? She was good as she always is. Even at the Awards ceremony she was surprised.<br />Me too!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|The Lion King is one for the record books. This movie was perfect in every aspect, from the beautiful opening sequence with the animals gathering at Pride rock to Simba and Nala displaying Kiara at the end with Raifiki. Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Little Mermaid are classics as well but The Lion King takes it as a masterpiece in its own league. The music, composed by Tim Rice, Hans Zimmer, and Elton John, was amazing. My favorite song is \\"Can you feel the love tonight?\\" That whole scene was the epitome of romance. I cannot find one flaw with this movie and I'm referring to the VHS version. I wasn't too thrilled with the \\"Morning Report\\" song. I think they should've left that out. Mufasa, voice by James Earl Jones, is the most masculine figure in all of Disney. Well, the Prince (Bambi's dad) may give him a run for his money. Do I need an explanation with Timon and Pumba? They were the icing on the cake; very funny characters that supported Simba throughout his adventure after Mufasa was killed saving his son. When this movie came out, I watched it for fun but now that I'm 25, I see this movie as holding a deeper purpose. I will show my kids The Lion King one day and even 50 years from now, this movie will still be discussed. Superb!!!!!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|To have an airline pilot like that, drunk all the time. Between drinking and cocaine I could hardly believe it or I didn't want to believe it. What a case was made for drug testing pilots all the time. For decades pilots have been using oxygen to sober up and relieve hangovers. But cocaine is over the top. Swarthy character John Goodwin was almost intolerable to see.<br />I usually watch most movies I buy more than once. This one, once was enough.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing game and has beautiful graphics this game is super addictive and truly genuinely fun it even has mystery boxes which contain hidden goods and treats for the players I have reached coin wise 15000 by myself in this game free game you need this is the one<br /> Rated by me ( and others TOO) 5 stars

0345803485|1.0|Who would have thought that best-selling erotica could be tedious and boring, but E.L. James manages to pull it off. It is a testament to canny advertising or the abysmal state of popular culture. This modern penny dreadful is written like an unsophisticated 16-year-old's fantasy of what sex should be like, divorced from the reality of real human sexuality. If you are interested in reading about real sex which is far more interesting, then invest in Alex Comfort's The Joy of Sex. If you are more visually oriented, then visit ifeelmyself.com to see real females in action. But for crying out loud, don't waste your money on this poorly written drivel.<br /><br />Let us hope that, as revealed on a Norwegian talk show, Ms. James has gotten so rich from this trilogy that she \\"never needs to work another day in [her] life.\\" Let her return to graze in the pastures of TV mediocrity from which she arose. Her lack of talent as a writer is so obvious that she should hang up her pen and spare the readers of the world from having to wade through this swamp of deplorable writing. Alas, as long as there's a buck to be made, the book sellers will push this stuff.
B0084BM7GW|5.0|One of the most amazing performance of Duran Duran!! I just loved it!! It`s really worth to buy it!! A wonderful production!!

B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love this game everyone should have it I'd give it a million stars if I could it is addictive I cant put I down
0345501292|5.0|This book is for the fan wanting more info than old newspaper and magazine stories could give. Plenty of interesting pictures and stories. Plus, a great price for a thick book.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have yet to get to books 2 and 3, but I am working on it. The first book was very well written and wow is all I can say!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really like this game. The graphics are pretty good and the gameplay holds interest really well. I would have liked it to be longer, though. Another thing of note, it's not a free game. After you play a little into the game, it asks you to unlock the rest of the game - for $5.00! I think that is a rather high price. $2.99 would have been a more acceptable price.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I have been a fan of all Batman movies and TV shows.  This Blu Ray was fantastic.  The package arrived with no damage and works fine.

B00B2V66VS|2.0|I got this app and was really excited it worked great for the first few weeks (2) and then I would open it and it would let me play it and I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it worked for a day no it worked for a night and then the next morning it didnt work and so yea is not working or worth it glad it was free
B00AA7O22U|3.0|a whole movie devoted to cheesy one liners,  (thats the part i liked).  There was barely a story,  and most of my favorite action stars look like they were brought back from the dead it just makes me feel OLD.
B005LAII80|1.0|First off, I just want to say that this is not a review of the movie, but instead a comment on the Blu-ray disk itself.<br /><br />As a European customer, I've bought a lot of Blu-ray movies from Amazon in the US, either to take advantage of extra features unavailable on editions sold here, or simply better pricing.<br /><br />I've also bought DVDs, and have been warned by Amazon when a disk is region-encoded and might not play on machines on my side of the, ah, pond. I accept that as a customer service advisory and make my decision accordingly.<br /><br />There are no such warnings (yet) when it comes to Blu-ray, so i was surprised that my copy of Dredd (excellent movie, by the way) wouldn't play on my PS3. Further investigation showed that it was, indeed, Region-locked,<br /><br />I checked a number of my more recent purchases (under a magnifying glass, it must be said) to see whether there was any indication of regional encoding, but found no evidence of any, so I figure this must be a new development in Blu-ray technology.<br /><br />That being the case, and being conscious that I can't be the only European customer of Amazon.com (or.ca, for that matter), may I respectfully suggest that Amazon adopts a policy similar to that surrounding DVDs, and provides a more visible warning about playabilty outside the US and Canada?<br /><br />Thanks...
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper is another excellent novel by Kate Morton--this lady knows how to spin a story.  I was taken from start, to finish; despite the length of this book, it doesn't drag anywhere.  The writing of wartime London is especially riveting.  The characters are well developed and amazingly, the children are as well developed as the adults.  You won't see the ending coming.  Very well written!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Good luck putting this one down.  While not perfect (there are a few places that dragged and a few that seemed to be mysterious purely for the sake of being mysterious) the few flaws are more than eclipsed by the book's many strengths.  Highly recommended.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is fantastic!You should get it!You can slice fruit and unlock blades.(I like the fire, butterfly, and rainbow ones.
1616550414|5.0|Love this book! Definitely a must have for Legend of Zelda lovers giving us a behind the scenes look at the characters and worlds of various Zelda titles over the years. It is also an great introduction and explanation of the world and timelines of the series for those just getting into the series. Overall I would recommend wholeheartedly the purchase of this book.
0307730697|5.0|I couldn't explain in a long enough review how amazing or inspiring this book is. Adam Brown was truly a hero on and off the battlefield and long before he even became a SEAL. I don't want to spoil the book for others so I won't go into detail, but one thing I have learned from Adam Brown's life is that if you put your heart and mind towards anything in life you will achieve it. No matter how hard or long.
0802473164|5.0|Yes, this book has not been on the NY Times best seller list for almost 190 weeks for no reason...I just started my kindle edition and skipped right to chapter 9 to find out my love language!  My son just got engaged and I bought this for him, I will give it to him privately as I do believe this may very well be the most important gift I give him...Gary D Chapman makes so much sense...my future daughter in law also got it...I want everyone to get it because it's not just for couples.  I want to be able to give my loved ones the love that They need and I would Love if the could love me in my language.  This could not be simpler, all you have to do is want to do it...want your relationships to be the very best they can be.  I love this and I hope this review helps, the more people that get this and work it, the more fabulous love we will have all around!!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|The app is easy enough to use, but I've had to reinstall it twice this week because it just froze on my Kindle Fire. I also wish they would give you a choice of how big you'd like to see the pins so I could read them a little easier.
B005LAII80|5.0|I never saw the original movie and had no real idea what it was about.<br />Reviews said it was great 3D and it was.<br />Not sure I would let anyone under 21 watch this. Really gruesome and graphic.<br />For instance, dropping people off a balcony 200 floors up and watch them splat.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Another purchase for my daughter as she enjoys this show. The product was good with no problems. She was very happy.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like that it's a game I can put down and come back to... but kindles are kind of jipped

0307476464|2.0|This the first and probably last book by Murakami I will be reading. Why?  Endless repetition. Meaningless conceits. When all is said and done, what's the function of an air chrysalis or the little people, other than to hang a love story on that otherwise would be preposterous. I hung in there and finished it just so I could satisfy myself that there was really nothing there other than contrived situations designed to keep the reader reading. And what's with the translator's over use of the phrase &#34;get ahold of&#34;?  Someone should point out that the word &#34;ahold&#34; is not proper English and there are other ways of expressing the concept, such as &#34;grasp,&#34; &#34;secure,&#34; &#34;seize,&#34; etc.
B000ZLFALS|4.0|Clearly inspired by the British Invasion, this is a wonderfully made modern musical.  Great story, great music, definitely not just a chick flick!

0765325950|5.0|Awesome finalization to the best fantasy series ever written. Sanderson did a masterful job of picking up for the late Mr. Jordan. Leaves a chance that a new series could be continued if the author desires to do so.
B002OR18HQ|5.0|Every song was wonderful good qaulity. Love seeing John play with his two sons. Great!!! He played all of his hits.

B007712XAU|5.0|Excellent!!! Could not wait to go on to the next episode. Loved this period piece! Even my husband was hooked!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Game loaded and played perfectly. Was fun way to kill spare minutes but the thrill has now passed.  Will probably be removing from my Kindle Fire.
1564148793|2.0|This book is not user friendly at all.  In order to really get the most out of it, I am going to have to learn how to pronounce all the Latin he's included, which I just don't have the time for.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I fell in love with Kelly a did most of her fans when she won American idol now I can take my favorite songs by her with me where ever I go
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I like this cooler, but its HUGE.  The downside to this style heatsink/fan combo is that you cant use the window side fan of your case.  Pretty big bummer for additional cooling, but I guess this guy does its job.  The other downside I noticed is that the Core Temp is 60 celcius, while the proc temp is 49celcius.  Not sure if this is a case cooling problem or the heatsink itself.  Either way, if I clock from 3.6ghz (stock) to 4.2ghz OC'd, the 60 degree temp doesnt change...  Only the CPU temp.  So something else might be the culprit.  Does what its designed to do.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see jersey boys on broadway  and fell in love with the music now I can listen to the original songs by the original artists

B002PHVHFI|5.0|Shipped quickly and without breaking, included a download code on the record, put my hipster cred through the roof. 5/5 stars.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I haven't used it often but I love the calming sounds it offers.  Some of the sound are just static to me but other people seem to like them.  Personally the creaking ship is my favorite.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Have the movie in 2D. Will pass that version along. Upon viewing the 3D version, we have no interest in viewing the 2D again!
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|With this memory module I brought the available memory on my Brother MFC-9970CDW Color Laser Printer up to the maximum. It worked immediately and continues to work without issues. I would recommend it to be used for this purpose.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's a fun game. I already have it on my phone and now on my kindle too. You really have to pay attention and be quick. My kids enjoy it also.
B000G73U5Y|4.0|STEELY DAN-DEFINITIVE COLLECTION: Failed Brill Building songwriters, touring musicians for JAY & THE AMERICANS, and unabashed DUKE ELLINGTON fans, college buddies WALTER BECKER and DONALD FAGEN founded STEELY DAN, whose snarky attitude towards rock stardom fueled an eight platter career that mixed prickly jazz-pop, obtuse subject matter and tricky time signatures. Originally a proper band featuring guitar wiz JEFF &#34;SKUNK&#34; BAXTER among others, BECKER/FAGEN eventually eschewed both touring and a permanent lineup in favor of flawless studio production and cream of the crop session players. The catchy Top 40 singles REELING IN THE YEARS, RIKKI DON'T LOSE THAT NUMER and PEG rub shoulders on this sixteen ditty anthology with deeper album tracks like DIRTY WORK (the one chestnut not warbled by FAGEN), BODHISATVA and BABYLON SISTERS. Casual STEELY DAN fans who pine only for the big hits may find this collection &#34;DEFINITIVE&#34;...but for fanatics, (you know who you are) this is merely an advertisement for their series of &#34;must-own&#34; original albums.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR QUESTION MARKS
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this is one of the better Angry Bird games. No hitches, runs smooth and it's fun and challenging. Some new scenes but not much in the way of any new characters.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I got this for my 7 year old daughter who loves horses. She loves it but it drives me batty with one question- will it or wont it load on my kindle fire?
B0053O89JM|5.0|Disks looked great, just like new.  I would strongly suggest watching season 7 before season 8, you can catch on if you missed season 7 tho.
B007REV4T8|1.0|This movie was horrible.  I am so glad we missed seeing it in the theater.  Wait until it is $1 and then still don't see it.
0545265355|5.0|I enjoyed the series as a cautionary tale but hate the idea of a world where these things could actually come to pass. I wish she would have gone into Haymitch and Effie's back stories, but this way we have more to look forward to. The Quarter Quell was a bit more than I bargained for. I'm glad Peetea turned out to be real and not just a player.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Like the way it props open in either portrait or ladnscare mode and allows access to charging and earphone ports.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Some of the noises are on a noticeable loop but there is a big enough variety of noises to make it worth while. Recommend this to anyone who is a light sleeper
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Action packed and intense. I really like the Jack Reacher character.  He is not out looking for trouble but it seems to find him.
B0041KVV8U|5.0|So far, Ive purchased 7 of the new Beatles vinyl re-issues.  \\"Past Masters\\" is among the best of what Ive heard so far.  The sound on these 2 discs are nothing short of a revelation.  There is so much punch, clarity, and detail in these grooves.  There are moments in these songs I'm discovering for the first time, like the subtle vocal reverb on the last refrain of 'Thank You Girl\\".  Disc One really demonstrates what a rocking band the Beatles were in their early days.  Ringo's drumming has never sounded more exiting and vital.  Disc One also reveals how well produced these early recordings were in the first place.  Indeed George Martin WAS the 5th Beatle, so integral in capturing the essence of Beatlemania.<br /><br />The true genius and artistry of Beatles really starts to shine on Disc Two, with so many classics packed on one vinyl.  The raw guitar riff of 'Paperback Writer' jumps out of the speaker with so much intensity, it's scarey. I'm hearing all of these Beatles classics in a refreshing new light.  I can't find anything bad to say about any of these new Beatle vinyls.  To my ears, they have more warmth, depth and dynamics than any version Ive ever heard.  Luckily I got a clean, quiet, defect-free copy of Past Masters.  These vinyl re-issues should serve well the legions of Beatle fans and new converts for a long time to come.
B005LAII12|5.0|I bought it as a gift and he loved it!  Wasn't my cup of tea but since it was a gift and he's happy so am I.
0470913029|3.0|This book was pretty good. The paleo diet has been helpful, although I needed some modifications. The book is well-written overall, but I would have appreciated more data to back up the claims.
8876250441|5.0|This is the final installment in the Twilight Saga and my favourite of them all.<br /><br />The relationships continue to develop and the character's continue to grow which is a feat in itself by the time you get to the fourth book.  The plot was strong with loose ends being tied up nicely.  The style was particularly more to my taste.  It is written in three parts: the first and third from Bella's point of view and the second from Jacob's.  It is an easy book to read and enjoy and a quick read despite its 700 page length.  Stephenie Meyer manages to keep your interest throughout.  It is a long time since I read the previous books in the series but I had no trouble at all remembering what had gone on before, I didn't need to do any re-reading to remind me of plot lines.<br /><br />A very good series if you enjoy books with character's that continue to grow, plot lines that are interesting but not overly complicated and a book to immerse yourself in and forget the real world for a while.  A real snuggle on the couch series.<br /><br />5/5 stars from me.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|it would be a 5&#9733; app of the shop actually uploaded every time I go on it on my kindle fire the shop never uploads making it very annoying other then that and want to get new stufff from the shop its one of the best picture app out
B00821PCJS|1.0|I am using my thirty day free trail of Amazon Prime.  I was attempting to press the resume button and hit the buy whole season button .  The shows are O.K. but not anything I would spend 15.99 on. By the way this only happens while using my 8 inch screen tablet<br />. Why does Amazon has 1 touch buying turned on  with their streaming and mp3 pages. It would be much better with a \\"are you sure\\" button before you actually buy it to cut down on mistakes.  Edit add on. just set parental controls on myself so accidental 1 click should not be a problem while on my tablet any more. Maybe a notice that's a little more noticeable on this quirk. I will probally  continue my Amazon Prime when my free trail is done.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is a must read actually the entire series and the one before is the best series ever !
B00A8OBSX6|5.0|When I settled in to listen to this recording I thought that it would be a quiet time with the music playing pleasantly in the background.  Not so!  The voice of Mr. Cencic brought me back up on the edge of my chair where I remained for the duration of the CD.  The florid music in the first aria, and the others in a similar vein, is sung with panache.  His rapid passages are clean.  The trills are genuine, not an approximation.  The Quieter items, such as Dolce mio ben, mia vita, are sung with such a finely spun legato that the singer ensnares the listener in a shimmering web of sound.  His piano singing is never thin or breathy.  There is a solid technique at work here to allow all of these wonderful things to happen.  The orchestra Il Pomo d'Oro is not one I have heard before but their musicianship is excellent and Riccardo Minasi conducts with a flair and dash or introspection as will serve each item of music best.  The combination of these artists working together make for an entertainment worthy of the glory days of Venezia!
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is a must read actually the entire series and the one before is the best series ever !
B008R9QAY6|5.0|I’m not used to writing love letters but rather to trying to be fair when I review a recording.  But…this is an excellent recording of a truly great work by a brilliant cast of singers and musicians culminating in a sparkling performance.  There. I said it.  When this opera premiered in Rome women were not allowed on the stage, hence the use of castrati.  The idea of recreating something approximating those practices with five countertenors seemed daunting to me.  How to easily differentiate one from another?  From the opening chords my interest was piqued.  Hearing these men together one can easily distinguish the difference in the colors of individual vocal palates to eliminate that problem.  Philippe Jaroussky’s voice is lighter and brighter than the other countertenors of this cast.  He portrays the youth and vigor of the title character as well as pathos in his tormented moments.  Max Emanuel Cencic sings the role of Mandane with a certain muscular vigor that lends itself well to the characters’ sense of honor.  Franco Fagioli has a luscious chocolate color in his voice that distinguishes itself easily from the others. I had previously stated in a review of Hasse Reloaded that Valer Barna-Sabadus had a limited color to the voice.  I am glad to have been proven wrong and am willing to admit it.  Here the voice is darker, warmer and richer by turns as needed to develop the character of Semira.  Yuriy Mynenko sings the role of Megabise with a balls-out, caution-to-the-wind approach that belies a formidable technique at work.  The odd man out here (read non-countertenor) is tenor Daniel Behle who sings the villain Artabano.  He executes his music wonderfully well and is a perfect match with the five countertenors in terms of virtuosity.  These singers parade their characters effortlessly through the strands of arias revealing a cache of glittering gems against the velvet background of the instruments of the orchestra.  Diego Fasolis conducts the Concerto Koln with such verve as to sweep one along on the energy of the sound.  He guides the singers with a hand that shows a great love of the music and respect for the voice.  This performance is a virtual feast for the ears!  I look forward with the hope that there will be more recordings of this period of music using these performance practices.  It is a must have for anyone interested in music of the Baroque period.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is a must read actually the entire series and the one after one the best series ever !

1616550414|5.0|AMAZING book full of nostalgia and education that can't be found without hours and hours of research on multiple gaming forums. This book gets you into the mind of the developers and brings you full circle on the history of the best gaming series ever made... The Legend of Zelda.<br /><br />Nintendo fan or not, if you've played a video game in the last 20 years chances are you know Link and the tale of the Master Sword! This book will let you relive those memories regardless of which installment(s) of the Zelda series you played.
B000TO0TCQ|4.0|its like having james bond as a dad who trained you its a really good series a must read !
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|This was a great movie. It was also nice to get the bonus features at the end and get to hear what the actual people who lived through this went through. I was at the edge of my seat most of the time towards the end of the movie, even though I already knew how it the story ended! It's definitely worth the time! The only thing I did not like was that the sound fluctuates way too much at the beginning. You have to lower or increase the volume every so often.
B00003CXAW|5.0|This is the definitive monster movie of all time.  For something that old (1933) it still packs a wallop.  The few close-ups of Kong's face are rivetingly grotesque even for something that is patently fake.  The wild eyes and bared teeth are still the stuff of nightmares.  It's surprisingly effective, doing exactly as intended, still relevant by today's viewing standards.  No \\"monster\\" movie collection could ever be complete without this film.<br /><br />My favorite character has always been the slightly sleazy braggart, Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong).  My least favorite character is the woman who wouldn't shut up (Fay Wray); her overwrought style of acting hasn't aged as well as Kong.<br /><br />And I still take exception to the last line in this film.  Just like a man to blame a woman for something he did.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Very informative. Should be watched by every consumer. It gives information about the food industry that most people do not know.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|This season has a few good episodes so far but for the most part it's starting to get tired. There are too many characters to focus on now and each episode tries to include each and every character. It would do better if they allowed some characters to be left out of an episode here and there to focus on the story of the characters that are supposed to be featured in that episode.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|What a great movie.  Keeps you interested the entire time.  Great plot with lots of action and suspense.  One of my favorites.
B005POK858|5.0|This was a great game that had me intersted from beginning to end. I was able to play it on my Kindle Fire using the PlayPad Pro from Nyko. The HID controls allowed me to play the game on my TV while sitting on my couch. Great story, smooth even progression and not too long. I really enjoyed it.

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|My wife and I love &#34;Homeland&#34; and it was a great second season--full of excitement and a great ending. I love the way an attempt is made to understand the terrorist position and that the Vice President(an obvious Dick Cheney character) is the ultimate criminal. What will happen in the third season???
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I saw this at Amazon for $29 and called my son.  I asked him if the movies were worth it, since I'd never seen them.  He said, &#34;Yeah, especially at that price.&#34;.  I plunked down my $29 and now have 3 great movies added to my DVD/Blu-ray collection.

B007P7UF06|5.0|This is the ultimate love story.  I've seen it many times, but not on blu-ray.  Absolutely stunning.  I'm glad that I made this purchase.  I'd like to give it more than 5 stars.

B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|With Peter Pan, Walt Disney enjoyed something he could not with Alice in Wonderland, even though both were established through books, plays and other versions. While Alice defied interpretation (though I contend Disney's still comes the closest of all films), Peter Pan seemed to work perfectly as a Disney animated feature and has been one of the studio's most consistent crowd-pleasers.<br /><br />Except for the \\"What Made the Red Man Red\\" sequence, which veers precariously into politically incorrect territory (especially the song lyrics), Disney's Peter Pan is very contemporary in many ways, particularly in its approach to the story as part fairy tale / part Archie comics triangle. I say this as a compliment, as I love Archie comics and the infinite way they expound on a series of simple themes, particularly the love triangle.<br /><br />In Disney's Peter Pan, the little girls all seem to have matured into young ladies eager to be the one who captures Peter's heart. Wendy is like Betty, Tinker Bell is more like Veronica. (I guess that might make Hook like Reggie).<br /><br />In a way, Peter isn't so much a child who doesn't want to grow up, he's an adolescent who doesn't want puberty to hit, much as today;s young boy whose voice is changing might keep choosing video games over girls until nature takes its course (though he never gives up the video games even as an adults). This Archie-like love triangle is standard operating procedure for much of today's youth-targeted films and TV, as it is in many grown up rom-coms.<br /><br />One of the most interesting among the many bonus features (this one from the earlier DVD release) is a storyboard of a deleted sequence in which Wendy and Peter are about to part and the dialogue gets so romantic it might have been a scene from An Affair to Remember.<br /><br />Speaking of bonus features, those who are not into Blu-rays will notice from the list below that the lion's share of extras are now only on the Blu-ray. You might want to keep the 2007 edition just in case.<br /><br />However, unless you get the Blu-ray Diamond Edition, you're missing a lot of wonderful, colorful \\"Mary Blairyness,\\" in addition to other magnificent sights in the crisp, vivid Blu-ray picture. (You can also get it with a digital download disc and storybook app.) I love the scene in \\"Following the Leader\\" in which the boys march into a field that towers over their heads. The bright yellow is striking.<br /><br />By the way, the singers of that song are the Bob Mitchell Choir, who sang in Going My Way, The Flying Nun and hundreds of other Hollywood TV shows and movies. The late Bob Mitchell also used to play the organ at ball games.<br /><br />And that flying sequence -- I don't care how 3-D movies get, there is nothing like that last flight off Big Ben out over London and into the otherwordly dimension where Never Land exists. One of the best aspects of Disney's version is how it avoids being literal about dream versus reality. Everything is nicely vague and left to the imagination. Too many films ground everything in a stark reality -- even fantasy films!<br /><br />Besides the delightful feature, don't miss the 40-minute featurette, \\"Growing Up with Nine Old Men,\\" another holdover feature from the earlier release.

B00003CX8N|5.0|I saw this movie on Netflix and loved it. It's an interesting story and the characterizations are spot on. My daughter teaches literature and composition so I bought the video and the book upon which the movie is based and will send them to her soon. I just know she'll enjoy them also.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I really like this game a lot.  It is a lot of fun and a great way to pass the time.
1555175163|5.0|This is a very charming book. AS a Ving Tsun practioner, ii and others like me concider Grandmaster Ip Man is something of a martyr figure, mentor, role model. His lifes work is a precious gift to us and his youngest son Ip Ching has blessed us with this special token of remembrance. It is not complete biography, but a book of 15 true to life short stories about the Grandmasters early life that contain valuable life lessons. There is much we can still learn from the great man who went through much hardship to ensure that Ving Tsun (wing chun) was not lost in history and that decades later, people of all ages may learn the ways of this special martial art for to protect themselves as well as the weak and very young. This precious little book shows us how the Grandmaster embodied respect, loyalty, courage and the importance of duration in practice. As much as wing chun practitioners will love owning this tiny book, its all too briefness will make them want for more. however, isnt that like life itsself? that may be taken as the books' final lesson: the best things in life are simple, direct, and very effective in purpose, just like the Chinese art of Wing chun. Do purchase this book, and may you enjoy its pictures, stories and influence as much as i have. thanks to grandmaster Ip Ching for this gift to us all!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|There are no instructions and for some of the levels I cannot figure out what I have to do to get the parts to fall.  Frustrating!  Someone help
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|We liked it.  Not ground breaking stuff, but entertaining and a little different than the usual Hollywood movie.  Denzel Washington does a good job.
0345529057|3.0|Got theses as a gift for my parents. Apparently, book 1 is missing a bout 20 pages near the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a wonderful game which I play often. Great graphics, fun games, and interesting enough to hold my very short attention span. For a game that is amazing for me. I would recommend it, for I am and ,always will be, a horse-crazed girl.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Love this movie. We bought it because our intention is to watch it every year the week of Christmas. Well done Jim Carrey...well done.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|random stuff going on.it was ridiculous, too many places to go. it was like an annoying maze..thumbs down. waste of time
B007LB5MF4|3.0|I would wait till it is on special. A little over priced for what you get.  A fun way to read the novel but there is way to much of the story left out. I am debating if I want to try the second volume.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book so much!  I have read each book at least 7 times! Five stars out of five stars!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a good download, my kids use it for some math homework when they bring there's home. Works good
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This story was so fascinating that I could not put it down but read it in a day.I fell in love with the characters and was so satisfied  with the ending.I highly recommend it!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Purple is my favorite color and just love this case. My husband bought it for me and he knows quality is important to me
B0002TJGQS|5.0|If you can plan ahead so you don't need a CR2032 in an emergency must have immediately situation and can tolerate a two-day wait these are definitely a great buy!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Excellent writing, a good read. Keeps your interest up all the way through. You could be up all night reading this.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The opening 20 minutes are very exciting, and then it rotates to a good character study with continued twists and turns. Denzel Washington and his supporting cast do an excellent job. Was a wonderful Friday night while it is raining/snowing movie.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Typical Reacher.  If you are a fan this doesn't disappoint.  If you are not maybe you will be after this.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|It's rare to see a film that accurately portrays what it looks like for a person to grow over the obstacles of life and become a better person for it. This film was inspiring... to say the least.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the fourth book I have read by Sparks, and it is probably my favorite. Suspenseful, beautifully compelling love story that has a surprising ending. Must read!!
006135323X|5.0|This books fits in with some other recent business books that use actual scientific studies to understand how people actually act.  If you are tired of business books that are unjustified beliefs of smart people and you actually want to uncover some truths about how humans really behave, then read Predictably Irrational.  Drive by Daniel Pink is another one of those books that references real studies.
0307592731|5.0|Adventure and true emotion in a real pageturner! I allmost booked a ticket to walk The Pacific Crest Trail. I am jealous, her story can only be told by a great American novelist!
0273710516|5.0|The book lays out ways to structure your thoughts in a convincing manner.  By no means is the recommended methodology the only way to convince people.  However, the book does provide a template that is fairly easy to utilize when you are trying to organize your thoughts.
B00845MRKE|5.0|The remastered Blue Ray version in the set is great!  When you compair with the 1982 version you can see a big difference and the sound is also much better.  Its also very nice to have the included 1982 release because it has the Ford narrations that can add missing info.  If you are a BR fan and dont have this set you need to check it out.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed the movie so much that I decided to pick up the book.  What a well written and touching story.  Matthew Quick shares a vulnerable, wounded man and a allows us to journey with him.  Highly recommend!!!
B009K45Y62|5.0|They need to make More dvd sets like this. Looks good nice for the price and a Great movie too!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|this calculated doesn't even have square root. I'm in 8th grade, that would have came in handy.overall this is a good app for a fifth grader.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book only confirms what I have believed since my youth.  I don't need to see, I believe and hope.  I am happy the good doctor has seen and perhaps with this book, others will believe and our little mudball earth will still have hope in having the Family of Man live in peace.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Very good! Super Great how! Can't wait for the next season!! Let me know when the next one is coming!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|This is the 2nd book in this series, it was pretty good and was interesting enough that I'm going to buy the 3rd book. To be honest though Lena is a lot less likable in this book. I was actually almost hoping Ethan would dump her for Liv!
B00000DGUY|3.0|I like Dire Straits especially the track &#34;Sultans of Swing&#34; but the really joy was watching my drunk uncle playing air guitar after getting this for Christmas.....
B0045ODPKY|3.0|got it in a timely order. the description said it was like new, but when i got it, it had a crack on the middle. It seems to work fine still
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|The seller was prompt with shipping and the product was just as described. My son loves it and put it together himself (He's 4). Yeah, I'm bragging about my kid in a review for a Lego product. I'm awesome.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is lots of fun and very challenging especially when the bombs start coming faster and mixed in with the fruit. Love it!
B002RSDW8A|5.0|I gave this as a gift,  but I had already viewed it.  Anything Meryl Streep does is very good.  This was no exception.  I really liked it.  I've watched it twice.  The story line is clever, and of course, the acting superb.
B000002ULO|5.0|My acquisition of \\"Flaming Pie\\" yielded a re-calibration of my favorite McCartney Albums.  Prior to \\"Flaming Pie\\" my favorite McCartney effort was \\"Tug of War\\".  The strength of WANDERLUST and THE POUND IS SINKING made \\"Tug of War\\" an easy favorite.<br /><br />Well,there's a new leader in town, and it came in on a \\"Flaming Pie\\".
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This series is one that my kids really like and they've followed these characters since the beginning.  So I try to keep them up-to-date on the series as it moves along.  They're very happy with it.  That's what counts.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Very nice great awesome good lovely super natural pimpin nice nice nice<br />Very nice great awesome good lovely super natural pimpin nice nice nice
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app to get to have a horse to take care of when you live in a place you can't have or afford one. Great graphics.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This book is Awesome & insightful. I highly recommend this book for any professional or parent. Go get it today.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Amazing app that I used daily. Its perfect and works 100%. Great developer too. Streams to by Bluetooth radio in car nicely
034580404X|3.0|Unfortunately I couldn't glue it back together because the box wasn't big enough to house all the books to begin with! My rating is not for the books, they are great, it's just based upon the case.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|While it had some entertaining moments, it wasn't something I enjoyed.  I like some of the actors, but the plot was slow and predictable.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Gillian is awesome and she pushes you. If you're looking to be pushed this is a good video, just make sure you're ready for it and never do more than you can handle!
0061992860|5.0|This book has EVERYTHING anyone needs to know about how to survive any where on earth, in many different situations. This book could save you or someone else life one day.
B004N8X6LK|5.0|Excellent book, interesting story, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Sylvia Plath does not disappoint, as usual!
0226264211|5.0|This book is written by a true genius of economics, history, and politics. Milton Friedman has illustrated the freedom's gained from free trade and the problems with the US governments involvement in the economy. Milton Friedman has shown that socialism and communism do NOT work and the only way to freedom is free trade!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|As always a great story. I haven't read my kindle version yet because as bad as I wanted to own a kindle I am having trouble reading from an electronic device instead of a real book. But it was delivered immediately
B00785P2QC|5.0|Just wanted to say this game is cool, but it takes time to earn enough money to complete all the tasks.<br />They could give you more money to the tasks you complete.
B000HC2LIK|5.0|Always a good movie. I do not recall buying this but I guess I must have gotten it for someone else as a gift
B003ODIZL6|1.0|You should do a kid's dictionary so they don't have bad words in them . I didn't really read this any  way . So make one for kids oooonnnnnnllllllyyyy kkkkkkkiiiiiiiiiidddddddddssssssss!!!!!!!!- I am serious get one for the kid's
B007REV4YI|1.0|Spoiler alert!  I will be alluding to plot points in the film, not directly but in a general way.<br /><br />I thought Quantum of Solace was a dreadful, cheap-looking snoozefest and had fully intended to skip this latest effort, but changed my mind because of the wonderful opening credit soundtrack by Adele, which evoked fond nostalgia for the 50 years of Bond cinematic tradition, and because the trailers gave me hope that the franchise was returning to the old-fashioned Bond movie formula of the suave secret agent with the beautiful women and the interesting gadgets (provided by the long-absent Q).  Alas, the trailers lied, teasing us with the appearance of Q only to have the actual Q scene in the film be maybe 2 minutes, tops, and blatantly rub it in the audience's face that there would be no gadgets to come.  The women also did not appeal to me in the least.  This film turned out to be another run-of-the-mill scruffy brute-force Bond film in which, for those of you who didn't realize it, Bond had 2 missions during the course of the film and completely failed at both.  We see him struggle mightily for 2 hours to accomplish something that, in the end, he utterly fails to achieve, rendering the previous 2 hours of viewing utterly pointless.  Honestly, I don't understand what the positive reviewers see in this film; this is not a Bond film, it is a sham that is trading on the Bond reputation while having none of the trademark Bond qualities that I so enjoyed in the historical Bond films.  The qualities that made Bond, Bond.  Maybe the Bond in this movie is closer the Bond in Ian Fleming's books, I don't know, but this is not the Bond that I spend my $12 to see.  I also can't imagine what they spent their budget on, because I don't see much expense on screen.  For me, this will be the last time I will be suckered into watching another Daniel Craig \\"Bond\\" film.  Sadly, as far as I am concerned, the Bond franchise died with \\"Die Another Day\\".  It's time to accept that and move on.  I just wish I could unsee that entire Daniel Craig series of Bond films.  Eight hours of my life I wish I could get back.<br /><br />The opening credits were good, though.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|This was the first.  Very interesting the way the hero was handled and even the villain.  You had to like the Hasty.  He is a really nice man and hates doing the things he does.  In fact, they bring his character back time and again for the Sheriff to consult with.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My wife and I are truly enjoying this; Foyles War was good but this has....servants!! Anyone who loves history and British drama.
1451695195|4.0|The book is well written and subject matter is very interesting. I think it is must read for everyone, christian or non-christian.
B005COO1X6|3.0|A great quick read for a long flight! Great but short :( too bad there isn't a sequel to it!
0670023329|5.0|Wow, what a look into a country we know so little about. It is hard to believe there is a place like this on earth today.
B004Y042N8|4.0|This is a nice calm game to pass time.  Saving the 5 star though since their is no music to go with the stages.
B00846F1YW|5.0|nice graphics! having a great time playing. going now to another room to play some more. keep up the good work!
B006ID6NDQ|4.0|Mrs. H. Beer displayed courage and tenacity during the  Holocaust.  I'm sure it is painful to recall the horrors she experienced.  Yet she tells of her past without reservation.
0670024813|4.0|I gave this book to my husband for his birthday.  He enjoys nonfic and anthropology.  We saw the review for it in the NY Times and he is finding it very interesting.
1606863622|4.0|I've been meaning to read more of Nicholas Sparks' work, and this is the second book of his that I've read. It was interesting, had a nice romantic storyline, and kept me reading. The only thing I wasn't completely satisfied with was the ending.<br /><br />I loved every character in this book. From Savannah, to her best friend Tim, to John's father, every one of them had a unique personality that made them memorable. I especially liked how the relationship between Tim and his younger brother Alan was shown.<br /><br />I don't know much about the miliary, or what it's like to be in the army. I like how Nicholas Sparks assumes that is true for most of his readers and lets us experience what it may be like for someone choosing to enlist.<br /><br />The ending . . . Well, I can't complain about it being unrealistic. For those of you who haven't read it, or watched the movie (I'm going to watch it tomorrow), I'm not going to give it away. But it makes sense, so I can't say I hated the book because of it. I just . . . Expected something different. It's not always a bad thing to get something unexpected.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am completely obsessed with this game, wished there were more scenes. I wish the different characters had special powers, or moves that were unique to them.
0385738781|5.0|I've been waiting to see what would happen to Thomas and the other survivors of the Maze ever since I finished the first book. Back then, I picked it up without knowing it was going to be a trilogy. Now that it's over, I know it'll be one of my favorites for a long time.<br /><br />I was worried about how all of this would end, but the plot is in the same vein as the first two books-quickly paced, leaving you no time to catch your breath, or a good place to stop for the night. Practically every chapter ends on a cliff-hanger, leaving me wanting more and more. I finished Death Cure quickly because I wanted answers! And anyone who's been following these books, worried about how they might turn out-no need to fear! The ending was better than I could have imagined. It fit the series perfectly.<br /><br />A lot of familiar faces pop up in this book. A lot of shocking things happen. Get ready to be surprised by what you'll read, shed a few tears, and dread anything like this actually happening.<br /><br />I'm trying hard not to give anything away, and that means I can't talk about . . . practically anything. The action starts on the first page, and doesn't let off from there.
0316044695|5.0|I bought this book to read on the train to and from work to pass the time. I found myself not wanting the ride to end because I didn't want to stop reading. I highly recommend this book.
0061726834|5.0|This book took my heart, pulled it out, and ripped it to shreds. And I loved every minute of it. I don't know why, but dystopians of this kind-where something as humanly significant as love is eradicated and basically every freedom is stripped away-are creepier than ones filled with invasions or epidemics or the like. Because this is the sort of thing we do to ourselves, not something we have no control over, or fight together as one. The people in Delirium allow this to happen to them, and don't seem to see anything wrong with it.<br /><br />Besides being majorly freaked out by the premise of the book, I was immediately intrigued. Of course it was predictable in the way most books are. Just reading the summary made it easy for me to see how some things were going to go. But it didn't tell me every twist and turn, how the book would keep me hooked and reading late into the night. I became fully immersed in Lena's world (and, by the way, I love her name) and learned gradually every terrible detail of it. And when she did the most horrible thing, `getting the disease', I was right there with her.<br /><br />Picturing every moment perfectly was not a problem. Everything was described in great detail, including the settling, the characters, and the society. I became terrified of the regulators, detested Carol, and adored Gracie. I could relate to Hana and Lena's friendship problems, as well as their hopes and fears for the future.<br /><br />There were so many unexpected moment in Delirium, they quickly made up for the parts I'd already filled in myself. And the ending . . . That has to be one of the best endings I've read in a while. I had to read it over several times, just to let it really sink it. Definitely the greatest part of a fantastic novel. It's going to kill me, waiting for the sequel to be released. Because I love this book so much, I give it 5/5 stars.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Bought this for my kindle fire hd.  It fits great and like the way the case revolves.  The case allows me to transport it safely in my purse.  Also has a nice strap to hold while reading.
B000LB7G00|5.0|You will wonder how you did without it after you get used to it. I really think it is necessary if you are into animation
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is by far the most amazing and awesome game. just one warning, this game takes up a lot of your space. I'd defidently recommend it, but only if you have the space!!
0142427837|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  The story pulled me right in and I was almost as exausted as the boy in the story.  Stephen King has a history of good stories.  This one was a little different, but interesting.
B0033807C2|5.0|This book was AWESOME!!! This is the best book I have ever read!!! There are... Battles, Myths, Gods, Legends, Battles... EVERYTHING!!! Percy Jackson is a half-blood (which is basically half-god half-boy). The greatest book in the series. Percy Jackson's main friends are Grover (who is a satyr) and Annabeth. Percy Jackson's father is greek god Poiseden, god of the sea.<br /><br />I highly reccomend this book for people over the age of 9. Thats it for my review :).<br /><br />P.S RICK RIORDAN RULES
B002VPE1WK|4.0|a little small...but for the budget its great. Fits all my lenses. cables. it's easy to carry. also space for my tripod.
0761169253|5.0|On the pruchase: Delivery on time and the package didn't have any problems.<br />On the book: This is great, I love the advices and it's really short but it really opens your eyes on what you should focus.
B009JBZH54|5.0|2 things to love...3 blur ray movies. 3 blue ray special features. movie it's awesome, no problem. great trilogy. Recommend it.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|Love it. Is real nice oatmeal happy with it it makes it nice carry around in my bag on trips or work
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is really addicting and fun. I am glad they made a second one. I cant stop playing it.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|i got the dvd in the mail , and i must say for the price its a really good deal ,
B003B02OQ4|4.0|I like Grisham and I've seen the movie so I was curious about the book. It was not a disappointment and just as good as his other stories. It was even pretty close to the movie.
B00881VLCE|4.0|G<br /><br />At game to pass time love the vibrant colors. The . Puzzles aren't  that hard to figure out once you get the hang of it.
B002WYJHBA|1.0|as with some &#34;made in Germany&#34; cd's i've gotten off amazon, this &#34;made in mexico&#34; blu ray does not play.  yes i've got alot of other blurays from amazon that have played, no i don't need an upgrade for my player. i guess this is  overseas licensing to make cds and dvds for an overall lower price. still its gotta play in the dvd player right? BOGUS.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Game Is Awesome , If Only You Have More Power Ups And Characters . Other Than That , This Game Is Awesome
159420411X|5.0|I really liked this book. The author shows a lot of humility forecasting. He describes forecasting methods use in many areas from earthquakes to economy. I think the book is clearly written and very entertaining. Don't think you will become a good forecaster after reading it :) . I think that the chapter on terrorism is a stretch a bit too far, but overall I enjoyed it a lot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so awesome I play it all the time I wish it came with the kindle I love it
B008JFQKMU|5.0|This is the second vinyl of the Green Day Trilogy. The tracks are short but you won't want to stop listening to them over and over again. Better yet, get all three albums on vinyl and enjoy listening to the sweet fuzz of Green Day's newest works before you see them live.
B00280LYHS|2.0|This book tells the story of my life this book is a gb good book because it has a storyline
B008JFQKN4|5.0|Perfect vinyl to complete my Green Day trilogy. No wasted room in the packaging and it came right on time.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The kindle fire case came very fast and the description in what size it was and everything was good, so it was easy to find.  I also like it a lot!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The game works well. It's basic free solitaire and I haven't had any problems with it crashing. I don't find the ads to be too annoying.
1423101502|5.0|It was just what it said it was, not really that complicated, no reason every business shouldn't be as rational and downtown to the basics--a six-year old is for crying out loud......
B0025KW29U|5.0|I don't care who you are this is a masterpiece of story telling, singing, humor, and awesomeness! The music is catchy, your heart breaks, you root for the characters, you begin to &#34;Do the weird stuff&#34;!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I had never read the complete edition of this book-read the YA version many times growing up tho--very good read even for adults
B001QWBM62|5.0|This bad boy is a wonderful sound recorder.  I will be using it primarily for filming.  But the options that it provides for a musician make it a versatile tool for anyone.  The built in stereo microphones collect surrounding noise beautifully and amazed me the with how much they pick up. I just wish I bought some of the accessories like the foam cut waterproof case:)
B005FISBTO|5.0|I really enjoy this series--Michael C Hall is very good in it but he was also great in 6 Feet Under-check him in that if you have not already
0307592731|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, my wife and I read it together. It's something everyone should read if they can.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have this app on both my ipod touch and my Kindle Fire HD.  You can get radio stations from all over the whole world.  My daughter is adopted from China and it was neat to be able to find stations in China so she could hear what Chinese music and talking sounds like.  You can save favorite stations, or favorite programs.  I like to listen to the Clark Howard radio program but since he is on while I am at work, I can find him on other stations in the country and listen to him when I get home.  Best .99 cents ever spent.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I love this app but the problem is I wake up and there is like a whole bunch of alarms but they duplicate from the one you use previously but I would recommend it
B00A70U7H4|5.0|I have all of the Glee albums and this one is one of my favorite!  The Glee cast does a great job on this album!
0071766588|5.0|its more than i expected its great just what i need to study for my test i now know that i will have great results
B008JOLG7U|5.0|Great collection of JLo's greatest hits! I do wish that &#34;Play&#34; had been included.  Any JLo fan will love this collection!
B008H08XW2|5.0|Not a huge M5 fan so can't really compare to their old albums. What I can say is I put it on play and don't want to turn it off. Usually some CDs have tracks that are not too good. I feel like every track is pretty darn good. And even his high-pitched whiny voice works in every track. I know, backwards compliment. I don't necessarily like his voice but the way the songs are produced... it just works.<br /><br />Yes, it is poppy. And I like that. I'd recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a great adventure.  The characters, their stories, the stirring and riveting words drew me into that cruel world filled with hate, horror, heart, home, humanity, and hope.  I could not escape...I find myself still wrapped with anticipation to consume more months after reading it.
B0072OFM28|4.0|This is a very good series, good story and characters that you care about. Also lots of killings and sex.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My whole family has fallen in love with this game! Hours of fun &amp; thinking. Great way to get your mind into gear.
0061990477|2.0|Let me start with the positive aspects: as a contemporary document as well as for the insight into life, nature and culture in Australia (at least of white people, there is not a word about the aborigines) I found this book interesting, also I liked some of the characters quite a lot, e.g. the protagonist's mother Fee (Fiona) and her daughter Justine; Justine's later husband Rainer and her brother Dane are well understandable and likeable personalities, too. But I have to admit that although in my time - as I remember - hundreds of thousands of readers, if not more, were crying floods of tears over this book, I cannot find any other positive aspect in it.<br /><br />McCullough's writing style is, I find no other word for it, repellent: she seems to enjoy physical, mental and psychical pain and describes humiliating and distasteful scenes with a disgusting love for details (e.g. Maggie's first monthly periods or her first sexual experiences with a brutal husband); descriptions of beautiful places and sceneries, even where these would be appropriate and the setting would be offering itself, do not seem to appeal to her or not to be compatible with her style. One of the few exceptions is Father Ralph, the male protagonist, whose romantic good looks and charismatic aura are described over and over again with pubertal enthusiasm and eagerness, turning him into a non-believable character right from the start.<br /><br />The so-called \\"love story\\" did not appeal to me in the least. \\"The Thorn Birds\\" is not a socially critical book, because what divides this couple is not Ralph's celibate state enforced upon him by Church, but the ambition of this priest who gives up the woman he loves for the sake of his career. (Maggie's aunt bequests her large fortune to the Catholic Church provided Ralph will administer it; he accepts the testament and subsequently makes his career in Church, being first made bishop in Sydney and later cardinal in Rome.)<br />On the other hand: what kind of \\"love\\" is this supposed to be? Maggie and Ralph hardly know one another; she sees a protector in him - he is almost twenty years older than she - while she is, in his eyes, some kind of unreachable, faraway princess. This results in huge amounts of suppressed sexual attraction which in time accumulates to the brink of explosion and, except for a short interlude, always remains in that state. Is there ever real intimacy between these two? Warmth, understanding? Deep talk about ideas and convictions? A similar attitude towards life and the things that matter most to them? In other words, trust? Not ever. Both never meet at eye level, and it is clear, right from the start, that both do not wish for it, believing that their obsessive, faraway idea of one another must be the epitome of true love. In Maggie's case we must add the fact that she is about as inexperienced and chanceless as Ralph when it comes to finding a mate, since she spends almost all of her youth on a vast Australian farm and hardly ever meets eligible men of her age, except for a few reticent shepherds. So she \\"falls in love\\" with Ralph and clings to this amorousness in the first place because she has no alternatives.<br /><br />Maggie, the beautiful, \\"sweet and innocent\\", tragic heroine of the novel is, looking simply at her behaviour and not at her feelings and how they are lengthily described, nothing but an arrogant, manipulating schemer. Of course she expects Ralph to be hers and hers alone; she does not accept that he is not ready to embark into a relationship with her and to leave church for her (what was he supposed to do, after all, having been a priest? Shear sheep for the rest of his life?) She LOVES him, and thus she automatically assumes that he has no right to make his own choices. She assumes, as a matter of course, that he will give up everything for her, so that she can \\"make him happy\\". But in the end they spend only a short, romantic vacation together after years of separation and inner torture; apart from that, their forbidden, senseless passion destroys decades of lives which may have otherwise been fulfilled, because despite all they do not want to give one another up; they \\"love\\" one another from a distance, full of longing, never really sharing their lives and minds and never knowing how the other really is like.<br /><br />That Maggie marries Luke without love, simply because he resembles Ralph a little, may be understandable; but as she finds only disappointment in her marriage she begins to \\"take matters in her hands\\" in an inexcusable way. First she enforces an unwanted child on her husband; afterwards she cheats on him with a man who had made an oath of celibacy; then she lets this one make her with child again, never letting him know or choose about it. Only after Dane's death Ralph is told by her that this brilliant, sweet-tempered young man, who was much more deeply and passionately lost in his love for God than Ralph, was his son - the last, brutal act of revenge of a disdained woman against the man who was not ready to give everything up for her.<br />Maggie never develops genuine feelings for another man, convinced that Ralph and he alone is the \\"love of her life\\", that \\"she was made for him\\", although she never really knows him, never shares his life and does not respect him or his choices. \\"Loving\\" him, she is convinced she is the only one who knows what is right for him - convinced she has the right to call him her own. Seen like this, Maggie is a tyrant of the worst kind because she takes possession of the people she \\"loves\\" not through physical, but emotional violence. (Ironically, the only one in this book who escapes a sad fate is her daughter, whom she never loves because she did not love the father.)<br />Ralph, on the other hand, is too much of a coward to accept his passion for her and additionally too stupid to ever consider that having unprotected sex with a woman for weeks may leave her pregnant. Excuse me, isn't the possibility of unwanted pregnancy one of the main arguments of Catholic Church when it comes to sex outside of marriage?<br />Except for their romantic names - Maggie Cleary and Ralph Raoul de Bricassart, names which seem to melt on your tongue - and their beauty, which is described in all details as well as extensively and copiously emphasized, both of them, looking close up, seem to have not one positive characteristic.<br /><br />So, the \\"thorn birds\\" torment themselves and others around them almost all of their lives, for the sake of \\"love\\". (These birds do not exist in nature, by the way, only in legends.) It is noble, so the novel eventually tells us, to endure the pain which ensues from obsessively clinging to the wrong person for decades, and never to leave this person the dignity to make his own choices. You believe you have the right to possess someone because you love him; but the truth shows that it is *you* who are being possessed by your feelings. Someone ought to have told the protagonists or at least the writer that real love exists only in freedom.<br />Is this story supposed to be \\"romantic\\"? If it is, I am grateful never to have made such a love experience. Instead of languishing and crying over this book I shall rather hope and pray never to know such kind of \\"love\\" as long as I live.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was a very good movie and is a very high quality Blu-Ray.  It is a shame the same director has no plans for any more but at lease we have 3 great movies
B0098XY5VK|3.0|THIS GAME WAS OK MAYBE MORE FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN.  YOUR SERVICE WAS VERY PROMPT IN MAILING THE GAME TO ME.  GREAT TO BUY FROM YOU THANK YOU
B009POCG2C|5.0|This DVD was great like new.  This is one of my favorite movies and I think Clint Eastwoods best.  So many stories between the lines.  Some have to watch more than once to get what this movie is trying to get across.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|I loved the music in it more than the movie but it was great any way you look at it
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I have to be honest, I just couldn't get into this book. It seemed.too childish for me to enjoy. I kept reading it hoping it would get better but it never really did.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|The game was a lot of fun.  The 3d rotation of the cube is smooth and fast. But accidently touch the back key on your Galaxy S3 (which is quite easy to do accidentally) and the game exits completely.  The game screen behaved oddly twice during the half hour I was playing it. The game graphic was on the screen but my screen touches actually activated apps that were on the phones screen just before I started up the game.  And there was no way to recover back to the game.  I uninstalled it twice and reinstalled but got the same flakyness.  I would recommend this game highly, once version 1.1 comes out.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|You just have to know what the secrets are so you'll have to keep turning the pages. Watch out if you're addicted to great story telling...you'll read this one in no time. Don't be put off by the insanity,<br />There really is a silver lining.
0679805273|5.0|Obviously, if you're ordering this book you have read it before! Very inspiring book. I bought this book for my 3 year old so I can have all her teachers and coaches sign it and write little messages in there as she get's older and will give it to her for a graduation present!
0761163808|5.0|This is well worth the money. A friend of mine bought this for my son for his birthday, and he just loves looking at the pictures. Definitely a great buy.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I can not say enough about this series. I saw it when it was on HBO originally years ago and have since tried to watch it on other networks and had to put up all the commercials. Never again. I can now watch the series when I want and without interruption. This probably one of the best series I have ever seen and I do not consider myself a war buff.
B0017GERLE|4.0|This is a good trilogy of inspiring work. I liked parts 1 and 2...wasn't that crazy about part 3. Still, a pleasure to watch.
0547995660|5.0|Really a good read. A great story and wonderful characters. I should have bought the paperback trilogy. Highly recommend saving money and buying the boxed set.
B000002O51|5.0|I was very happy with this purchase, it shipped quickly and arrived brand new and played perfectly. I would buy again this same way.
B000NY12LO|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I didn't really know where the story was headed when I started reading. I was only able to read small portions at a time as this is such a painful subject. It was one one the most thought provoking books I have ever read. That's what makes a good book in my opinion. Good job to the author of this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow. What an awesome story. It was beautifully written and I would loved to read another story of Alex and Katie.
0060763280|5.0|Another great book on the different  thought processes between the wealthy and everyone else.  T. Harv Eker writes in a fashion that is easy to understand and is straightforward.  This is a book I will continue to read over and over again for its insight.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book as a get away from reality and thoroughly enjoyed the entire series of books.  The character development and evolving plot were what kept me reading.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had resisted reading this series when it initially came out, but I enjoyed the speed of the story and the narrative twists and turns. Looking forward to finishing the series.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|If you want me to write a revies on this book I cannot because I did not buy it and I would like to know who did.  If someone use my account without my knowledsge please let me know.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The book was hard hitting and very emotional. Characters were amazing and easy to identify with! Great for anyone to read.8 would recommend it to anyone!!
B00942S4OY|5.0|daughter loves them - Christmas wouldnt be complete without the new One Direction CD. Good sale and purchase. Boy bands come and go- but for now - this is THE band in the hearts of 13 year olds every where.
B004HO6HWA|4.0|Any movie he is in is guaranteed action. He is not the one to mess with on any level. I adore majority of everything he is in. He can be my mechanic anytime.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I couldn't stop playing! It's so much fun. It's like a temple run, but a little more colorful. Great game.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Dwayne or the Rock shows action from beginning to the end. He looks so dag on good while handling his business. Saying no is not an option for him. I smell what he is cooking and it is called REVENGE!!!! 10+
1401233791|4.0|a really good version of the Bane v Batman tale, with added extras. The following volumes are also worth checking out.
0800141806|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies that came out and with 2 lead actors made it better. Justice was served and fed to all the ignorant people and Denzel got humbled by Tom's character. Teary eyes for the compassion in this movie. Love it, love it,love it!!!!

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Quick easy read. The description of the raid on Abbottabad was chilling. I have to say I feel sorry for the kids that were in the compound, but that's what happens in war. I found the author's political statements at the end to be out of place in a well written history of his navy life.
1439102813|5.0|This book is eye-opening, to the many different aspects of memory loss, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The story is best read a bit at a time in order to reflect on it from the viewpoint of the main character, the spouse, the daughter, the friends and employer.<br /><br />Each scene/interaction is packed with underlying insights and symbolism. Still Alice gives empathy to the reader for those afflicted with Alzheimer's--how to recognize early signs, how it progresses and also how to interact with someone who may have the disease.<br /><br />This book is not one to read for an uplifting experience. It is one that everyone should read--because everyone will ultimately be impacted by memory loss (directly or indirectly) on some level.<br /><br />The main character is easy to identify with; written in the first-person from the viewpoint of a successful and vibrant middle-aged woman with the disease.<br /><br />After reading \\"Still Alice\\" a person will have processed a great amount of information and will be more prepared to effectively deal with this insidious problem it if and when the time comes.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0578041197 Why Don't They Just Quit?]]<br />Co-Author:\\"Why Don't They Just Quit?

0062238310|5.0|What can I say about this script/book?  I love it!!  Love the show even more now that I have a piece of it.  This was a great idea.  Thanks.
0375869026|5.0|Previewed this for my 8 year old and was thrilled to discover one of the best books I've ever read!  Every middle schooler, soon to be middle schooler, ex-middle schooler, parent and teacher must read this book!  Palacio does a tremendous job of addressing acceptance and a wealth of middle school challenges all the while emphasizing and celebrating kindness in a way that is equally accessible to kids, pre-teens, teens and adults.  She touches on many important themes but always with just enough detail for me to be completely comfortable letting my 8 year old read this independently!
B003JBHQP4|3.0|its okay. Does what it is supposed to, no problems thus far. Not expecting any.<br />best suited for techno savvy individuals.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a great app to use. Very good &amp; helpful to use. I haven't had no problems with this app.
B0051SDM5Q|3.0|It's OK.  There were a few good points I could use, but nothing exceptional stood out to me.  If you are in a negotiating job, you may very well benefit from some parts of this book.  I would have liked to seen more real world examples of how to apply techniques discussed, instead of the simple examples the author used instead.
0316224588|5.0|Ian rakins is kool, and rebus is a great character. Glad he is back, good read and worth the money.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I really liked this book.  It's a great reminder of the perspective we should have of what's really important in our lives.  I found myself recommending this book to several co-workers after I ready it.<br /><br />It's an easy read, simple story to follow with important points that are subtly made.
1596177373|4.0|Very affordable and great drawings on the cards. Bought them for Granddaughters game nights and she loved them. Came very quickly and packaged safely.
0763621803|5.0|This is one of  my favorite books as an early childhood educator.  It is entertaining yet delivers a good nutrition message to youngsters in a fun way.  I have used this book in a program to encouage 4 and 5 year olds to be &#34;Fit Foodies&#34; with great success.
B006R1T40I|5.0|After all these years in the industry, Bonnie Raitt continues to entertain....her talent is amazing and I really like this new release!
B007SGM084|5.0|I was a little nervous to read this series due to the &#34;content&#34;  well I must say once you get past the graphic sex, there is a great story behind Christian Grey.  I fell in love with all of the people in this book especially poor Christian, I could not put this book down.  People who only read the first book usually end up saying it was a horrible book.... if they would just finish the trilogy, they would be swept away with the drama.... oh my goodness.... I have bookmarked so may exciting parts.... and not the sex parts either.. the tender moments and thrilling sections...
B00005JSGK|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and loved it. now i want to share it with family and grandkids. fantastic production
B00004WG2F|5.0|I had this movie on VHS and was so happy when it came out on DVD.. I have shared it with my friends and they have enjoyed this movie as well.
B0058U0EEO|5.0|This album has quickly become one of my all time favorites, and I'm eagerly awaiting further releases by Washed Out. They're one of the goto bands of the &#34;chillwave&#34; movement and are excellent at creating interesting and complicated soundscapes. They're the type of band you can go back and listen to the album a few times and hear something different and feel more in love with the album each time.<br /><br />If you're into dreamy pop that makes you want to drink lemonade on a surfboard flying through space, this is your album.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I have already watched this season but wanted the set so I could watch my favorite episodes!!!  I would recommend this to anyone who loves Criminal Minds!!
B009D5VPTI|5.0|Brave was fantastic, and as usual Pixar has delivered. Brave really blew me away as it broken down many conventional &#34;Princess&#34; themes that fall into many movies. The main character is strong, independent, and totally capable without the prodding of outside forces. The antagonist of the story (if you can call it that) is also certainly surprising, and the movie definitely will bring smiles.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, and although it may seem very &#34;Disney Princess-y&#34;, I promise you're in for a fun surprise.
1451696205|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas and she just loved the story.  I bought it in hardback because that is what she likes to hold and read..
B00683JK9K|5.0|Great graphics and with selection of how many pieces to play with makes it fun for all ages.  Have purchased quite a few and am anxious for more products!
B001AW156U|5.0|they are great for extensions on the triggers and easy to install on the controllers would recommend to the serious gamers
B006I1OB0U|1.0|It would have been helpful if it were noted on the item page that this is the final episode of Season Two.<br /><br />Very disappointing.<br /><br />We love DA and thought this was a new and fun thing to watch at Christmas only to discover that we'd already seen it in our viewing of Season Two.  :(  Boo Hiss.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Wow what can you say. She sounds like an angel.. She gets better & better each time I hear her.
B008OHV5QO|5.0|Neil is one of the best artist there is I would recomend this to anyone who loves music Truly a gifted man
B00000J6FO|5.0|This was such a great product brand new and perfect!! Was a great Christmas present I was so happy with it plus the seller is very friendly and helpful :)
B000000WGL|2.0|While there are so many anthem guitar riffs from Keith we all need to tip our hats to, his journeys into rock records where he is the vocalist, no hat tipping needed.<br /><br />I am sure he means well and there are stellar sounding tracks, I'd bet there isn't a linguist or interpriter amongst us that can decipher what Keith is wailing, crying and growling about. Then to make matters worse, for some reason his vocal lines are mixed well below the level of the surrounding music, yes this hides flaws but I shouldn't have to borrow Charlie Watts’s hearing aid to hear Keith’s lyrics.<br /><br />I know, it's only rock and roll, but I do like it and it's hard to fully appreciate a work you can't access. So download the lyrics and read along, or simply buy a Stones album where you still stand a chance of understanding 85% of Mick’s golden throat offerings.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Kept me entertained! I did not want to put the book down. My favorite of the 3. It has action, suspense, romance, and mystery! I wish there was a fourth!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show.  The acting is well done, it flows nicely and it gives the viewer a glimpse into times long past.  I would recommend this to anyone curious about the time period or that enjoys drama.
B00518HBD0|5.0|I don't care that there is only 1 new song on this album. It is more about the memories that the songs bring up. The new track is good too.
B000IONJH4|1.0|DVD was not compatible with my player. I don't know how to rate it. Ihate the fact that I couldn't use it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|GREAT televison!  Flawless production values and acting!  First-rate, you will fall in LOVE with the characters and with Downton Abbey, my new, favorite show!
B005GSVFB4|5.0|When I first watched Toy Story 1, I was yet a little kid who could not understand a few things about the plot. But, when this movie was released in 1999, became my favorite, until know. I cannot remeber how many times I watched this film in the cinema, but at least more than five times. I fell in love with Andy's toys, and therefore this Toy Story saga became my favorite in animation area.<br /><br />The idea of making toys alive is still creative, imaginative, original and unique. I have not seen other original films like these ones so far since a long time. However, no film would replace this saga... it will remain in my child heart forever.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|I was very surprised how choppy and inconsistent this movie was. Editing was choppy and the story really missed the mark in terms of presenting martial arts as the centerpiece. Action sequences were just all over the place and you could clearly see the wire works were sloppy. Why not just get bunch of people and make them run into each without doing anything physical? I didn't understand why Lucy Liu was speaking Chinese and then English while all other Chinese characters were speaking English such as the Lion Clan. Why is Russell Crowe in this movie? He rarely appears in the movie and all he does is whore around. In the end, I had to really think about the point of this film and I realized, oh yea, that dude wearing the spiky black suit was trying avenge his father's death. That basically drove the story, right? I think - still a bit confused. Definitely not worth the money. I'm just glad I didn't watch this at the theater.
B005GSVFAK|5.0|When Toy Story 1 and Toy Story 2 were finished, I did not expect for a third one: I thought the saga was complete. But years later, when I grew up as teenager, and another movie was announced, I felt happy and nervous.<br /><br />Happy because there was a chance to repeat all old-childhood memories. Nervous because I was older than before, and I had watched many films in which the sequels did not work or were terrible. I was afraid that this was going to happen to my favorite kid-franchise.<br /><br />When I first watched in cinemas, in 3D, I really did not care about the 3D: I was crying, yeah! as you read: in the first scene I couldn't hold up some tears. The movie was beautiful, the story catches you completely, and you are part of the plot. I mean, in Toy Story 1 and 2 we all were kids, as Andy was. Then, in 2010, This generation and I were teenagers, and Andy grew up with us. This was so touching, and I think I will not live and experience like this anymore in the theatre.<br /><br />I do not care if this movie gained the Oscar Award, it gained more: the hearts of all the kids or teenagers who accompanied Woody and Buzz in their adventures. These movies are more than classics now. You actually cannot die without watching them!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a Great 3D  Game and really Fun If you ARE board.this would be an Excellent Thing to do and for iphone user it may be Slow.Good Luck Have Fun! ;)
B00AA7O22U|3.0|It's exactly as the last movie, a lot of people killing other people. Old guys trying to remember when they were young... is not bad, but there are better options...
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Lovely little adventure game with lovely graphics and great mini games, only downside is that the full game is very pricey!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I tested five star because the way this book shows the true friendship of the book is truly extraordinary. I loved the book from cover to cover. I would recommend it anyone who lovesPercy Jackson.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. If you're looking for a jump-out-of-your-seat movie, I'm afraid to tell you this will disappoint. There are a few jump scenes, but this movie relies more on atmosphere, storyline, and building tension. That being said, it's a very solid movie when compared to the low expectations of horror movies nowadays.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Love this CD !  I have bought this CD before when it first came out years ago.  I lost it or someone stole it from my collection so I purchased a new copy...
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|This movie contains both a terrifying and beautiful storyline. Are there a few flaws? Sure, but the overall plot was wonderfully constructed. The only other issue I had was with some of the CGI. It was somewhat cheesy in certain scenes but was tolerable in others. The atmosphere was great--I was on the edge of my seat, especially in the beginning. Keep in mind the other kinds of horror movies released nowadays...this is a gem compared to those!
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Fantastic regimen with compelling and sufficiently detailed explanation of the science behind the program.<br /><br />To make the MOST of it, also get the Yayog app for iOS (iPhone/Pad).  As good as the book is, the app is even better-- but ONLY if you've read the book
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book! You'll never suspect the events that occur. It's honest the best book I've read so far. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is one of my husbands favorite movies.  I got it for him as a gift and he was thrilled!<br />The shipping was timely, the product was exactly as presented and the packagig was minimul which I appreciated.
B00A1XIXM8|3.0|This review's going to be a little short, but that's because there isn't much to say about Bad Religion's new album. To help put my opinion in perspective for anybody reading this, my favorite Bad Religion Albums are \\"Suffer\\" and \\"The Process of Belief.\\"<br /><br />One of my top ten favorite bands ever released a new album, and everyone said it's a glorious return to form, and shows a new level of sophistication, or some such nonsense. This album is True North, by Bad Religion. After listening to it several times, I shelved it and will probably not bother listening to it again, except perhaps a few months from now if I forget why I'm not listening to it.<br /><br />The album has a certain level of cheesiness to it that I just can't ignore. There's a song about how fun it is to do exactly what a person expects and say \\"f*** you\\" to them instead of arguing with them like an intelligent person, and a song called \\"Robin Hood in Reverse,\\" which is just sooo unbelievably creative a title.<br /><br />There are a few fast-paced and moderately catchy songs, but I feel like their rhythms are starting to just conform to standard Alternative rock. I honestly forgot I was listening to Bad Religion a few times. Sometimes it just became background noise, like I was at a restaurant with the radio playing.<br /><br />So, to summarize, I am not a big fan of this album because it isn't punchy or fast enough, and the lyrics are often cheesy. It might be a little better than their last album, but it's nothing to get too excited over. Save your money. Or even better, buy NOFX's new album instead. Theirs was great.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I hated this film. It was aimed at a 10-year-old boy's sensibility/humor, but was completely inappropriate for that age level. I'm not sure where they intended to go with this script, but wherever it was, I didn't get there. I can't imagine how anyone, no matter how juvenile their humor, could give this crap 5 stars.
0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin is an excellent writer and in this book makes Lincoln come alive.  She writes in a style that makes you feel as if you were looking over Lincoln's sholder as he navigates the politics of America prior to and during the civil war.  I have often thought that you cannot understand America unless you understand the civil war.  Get this book and read it!!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I had to write a review to ensure this product is properly recognized.  I am not a techie and only recently (2013) have converted to the idea of heart rate training.  I bought the watch (used) because of the solid reviews.  It has been easy and not frustrating to get going with it.  You have to spend some time with it to understand it but that's life.  It then pays off in term of super accurate biofeedback and really great reporting through the Garmin website.  I am going to keep finding these units used so that I always have one.  I bought mine through kijiji for $125 (Cdn.)  Garmin was a pleasure to deal with as they assisted in unregistering the previous user even thought mine was not purchased new.<br /><br />Running with it is everything I hoped for and the heart rate strap is very comfortable (I wore it for a weekend to see how accurate the heart rate information was.)  I hope that the principle of heart rate training in my running will pay off but this tool is all I need.  The GPS accuracy and satellite communication is fine.<br /><br />Top marks and am a Garmin fan now for life.  This one is a no-brainer (and that is not always the case in this imperfect world.)<br /><br />Martin
B00008WT5M|5.0|does what i need it to do, good deal, thanks alot and now for a few more words so I can post this.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game, it has quickly become one of my favorites!  So addictive, and my kids enjoy playing with me as well.  Beautiful graphics.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Read this all in one sitting and liked the end. I look forward to more books by this author. Gave this four stars due to the fact that some parts of the plot were a not realistic. Liked it anyway, good weekend reading
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. It has beautiful graphics and was easy to figure out how to play yet challenging at the same time. I always enjoy these Myst-esque but always would get stuck and give up. Hints are provided if needed which was nice and helped me in a few places when I got stuck. I could have figured them out on my own but I got a little impatient and it didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of the game. The maps were also super helpful. Well worth the price and I look forward to checking out some of their other titles.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This was a awesome book, Patricia always keeps you guessing. If you love suspense and criminal mysteries this is the book for you.
B007P06DOK|5.0|Words cannot adequately describe the emotions that come forth in the CD as the people of South Africa struggle to survive in so many ways.  His respect and genuine empathy for the music, the culture and the people of South Africa comes through like in ways that are indescribably.  This CD should be required listening in all music classes in all schools across America!!!!!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Capitalism in America. It will make you want to refresh the &#34;Tree of Liberty&#34;. A real eye opener and a must for every cognizant citizen's collection. After you view it the question is, what is the next step?
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it. if you like this game you should try temple run 2.this was the hes game I ever played
B006ZE66P8|5.0|'Nicely illustrated & great price! 'Downloaded this just in time for the holidays...'Would recommend this download, not for a young child, but great nostalgia for a teen or young adult...Thank you Amazon!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Fits my Fire quite well ,is quite adequate in protection ,would like a littel more stiffness in joint for cover so stand up feature a little easier to use
B008Y76A5A|5.0|'Better film than I expected, particularly for the price point in HD...Thank you Amazon! 'Looks & sounds GREAT on my Kindle Fire HD
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Once I started reading, I had to finish. Very captivating and engaging. A good read I will recommend to anyone.
B003QSLDTA|5.0|I was impressed at how well the actresses played each role. They were fantastic. This movie is very funny. If you find a fully clothed, male, minor wearing a bra in order to annoy his sister &#34;offensive,&#34; then steer clear. Otherwise, you will find this movie very entertaining.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I wouldn't say it is the best Bond movie, but then again, you need to see it for yourself to make that decision, and it is certainly worth watching.  I'd give it an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game might be fun but I wouldn't know.  My kindle says I have it but I don't so I can't play.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|*Spoilers* A little boring and slow. Sexy people in it, but I was bummed by the happy ending. To be honest, I preferred her weird made up ending, but I was really confused as to why that was her fantasy.
0871164566|5.0|This is such a great book that I have to get three more copies for friends.  They can't wait it get their own copy.
B00B5HQLMI|2.0|With all the hype during the Olympics and the Heineken commercials I was expecting something a whole lot more. It was a let down.. Adeles flats and majors and minors she cant seem to continually sing on key. She gets lucky and then the luck dies. This is the first time ever I fast forward through the opening credits. First of all the stunts were not all that great. even the bad guy wasnt that hard to kill or catch. No cool gadgets, or abundant hot women, or even a good plot. Havier Bardem seriously???? Bond is suppose to be the most interesting man in the world. He is suppose to go into a nuclear explosion and emerge only to dust off his tux and the hot girl on his arm or she is the bad guy and he kills her. His gadgets a palm print walther and a transmitter the size of a lighter. Thats it and the bads guys weapon his big bad death weapon a laptop. He is a super hacker. Thats it. The story line is basically Batman Begins right down to the destruction of the family manor. The bad guys in these movies are suppose to be horrifying. They want world order, they want to control the media, they want a new world, or they just want the human race to start over. They are terrifying and can get to anyone who stands in their way. the stunts are suppose to make your jaw drop. There are better stunts in the Bourne films. the women not bad but nothing memorable say for instance Halle Berry emerging from the waters in Cuba in that amazing swimsuit. Or Famke in blue leather and jodphurs and boots in Golden Eye. there wasnt even a cool car or cool cars show cased. Seriously the 1960's Aston Martin??? which they destroyed. There was not a cool Q some young kid no John Cleese, no smoldering hot tenson between bond and Money Penny. No they decided to kill them all off and M dies.. Seriously Judy Dench doesnt get to retire as an M? wow... Oh and the bit part Albert Finney did. He needed to be in the movie alot more. He was the most interesting man in the world.<br />This seems to be thenew bond pattern. Casino Royale was the only really good Daniel Craig bond film. The best well lets just hire Jason Bourne. I do not think Im going to watch this epic series again unless they get back to the movie magic. I thought they would stay the path like the Pierce Brosnan movies. Those were really good. Please stop copying other epic movies and come up with something on your own.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|... to copy audio CD tracks on my PC, edit them and then burn copies of the edited tracks when I get an album like this. Whatever possessed Ms. Gardot to insert an 11+ minute silence at the end of the last song, followed by a hidden track (&#34;Chegue Journeyman,&#34; according to Wikipedia) is beyond me. An otherwise excellent album, marred by this pretentious, self-indulgent &#34;artistic&#34; nonsense. It may be novel during the first listen (after the initial confusion subsides), but who would want to track an album like this and repeatedly have to either punch the next track / next disc key when the last &#34;unhidden&#34; track has played, or press / hold the fast-forward button to seek out the hidden track?<br /><br />To add further insult, the hidden track is IMHO pure crap. Nothing but a mish-mash of traffic / street sounds, with a musical background, overlaid by the vinyl LP-like clicks and pops that we all rushed into the CD format to get away from in the first place. Bewildering to me.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Purchased as a gift, and he is thoroughly thrilled with it. MP3 download which came with is also amazing. Good stuff!
B0026J8LHM|3.0|I won't say that this is a bad album.  However, I will say that Dream Theater seems to have something both similar and better than everything on this album that they have done prior to BC&SL.  Prior to this, I won't say that Dream Theater had done no wrong.  I did think 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence was a weak and repetitive effort.  However, that much was all cleaned up when I heard 4 Degrees of Radio Edits, which is I think is totally awesome.  I'll also say that I can't tell if A Nightmare to Remember is supposed to be comedy or is serious, which probably means that the band was serious. Lol!<br />I guess what I find most disappointing about this album is that physically it offers nothing more than a typical hair band album, like say Poison, or Warrant.  Yes, I admit to liking Poison, but I don't have any delusions about their technical grandeur, and when it comes to technical grandeur that is what I expect from them, and I feel that their offering of technical albums fills a very important role in many people's lives, in the same way that folks where angry when Pantera broke up because Pantera filled a very important niche in peoples' lives.<br />Wither is nothing but an mediocre ballad.  You know the standard ballad Dream Theater puts on an album that is just trash to attract new fans to the other stuff that they do that is better.  Except, what is different on this album is that the cheese ballad is one of the better songs on BC&SL.  Enough said!!!  .  As for this album, it doesn't have any redeeming greatness, just mediocrity that might help them get popular, so I suggest moving on to something that will challenge you more intellectually, and not stuff that would have made it on the radio in the 1980s.<br />My best advice is not to buy this one and to buy a real Dream Theater album like Awake or A Dramatic Turn of Events.
1409144720|5.0|The end of a series of good mysteries brings on a sense of loss that is hard to describe. I have mourned a few of them (Henning Mankill's Kurt Wallender and John Harvey's Charlie Resnick, to name but two). The event is made worse by the fact that an author has the power to resurrect the character if he chooses to do so. Whatever the reason for ending a series, and I'm sure there are several, like the urchin in \\"Oliver Twist,\\" my plea is for MORE.<br /><br />So, thank you Mr. Rankin for bringing Rebus back for more crusty battles with authority and more rule bending in pursuit of a just result. Malcolm Fox is a fine character and a change of pace. Unfortunately, Rebus trained us too well to distrust Complaints and I, for one, can't be converted to a believer. I was thrilled to see a colleague of Fox questioning his motivation in targeting Rebus, a view that confirms the long standing Rebus contempt of Complaints personnel.<br /><br />I envy people who have yet to savor the Rebus series. They have a great reading experience ahead of them. I recommend starting with the earlier books, when Rebus was active with the force.
B000002ITM|5.0|When Testament started out, they had too much grind for many to take notice of them.  If they followed that path, then they would have wound up like virtually unknown bands like Napalm Death.  Okay stop right there.  Some people love Napalm Death, and if you are one of them, that is cool by me because I typically don't judge bands by the amount of fans they have.<br />What I like most about The Ritual is that it sounds close to being a sellout album, such as something my wife can listen to, while still sounding dark enough to be classified as metal.<br />I don't know if the drums were triggered, but it doesn't sound like they were.  That is always a plus.  Also, the distortion is not overdone.  I can generally tell what is being played when the distortion knob is cranked up to 10, but when every heavy band does that and also adds compression, it is like there is no dynamics to the sound.<br />The Ritual in a way sounds almost like Testament had admitted a failure on their earlier albums, and was going to head in the direction of Megadeth and Metallica during the better days of their career.  If that was their mission, they accomplished it well, and the ritual is on par with Metallica's Kill Em' All, and Megadeth's Peace Sells, But Who's Buying.<br />Likewise, though Anthrax has usually gotten more attention, especially in the early days, than Testament, Testament was much more flexible, and in my opinion proved to be the better band.  Thus, it should come as no surprise that when the killing days of metal, meaning the days where it became nearly extinct, Testament was able to pull through, and eventually flourish.<br />So, why 5 stars?<br />This album deserves 5 stars because anyone should be able to listen to it, appreciate it, and have something positive to say about it, no matter who they are or what walk of life they come from.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I love my handle you really have to know how to film to use it to it's great full potential
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I wish we had more well written stories like this. It's more than romance. It's a glimpse of how we continue to evolve through life. The great and versatile acting brings you deep into the story.
1416905014|5.0|I am a grandmother who loves popup books. This particular one is very detailed and filled with extra popups on each page. My grandchildren love it!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am very addicted to angry birds! This is a great app and work perfect on my kindle fire! Its free and that is a plus too!
1419705849|4.0|We enjoyed it
B008RXYOKY|5.0|The reason I bought this was to hook my Macbook Air to my Presonus Studiolive digital mixing console, and the items play nicely together, which is all I really wanted.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I love Thor.  He is my favorite superhero.  Plan to watch the movie soon.  Not enough time in the day to do everything.  Delivery time was great.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|The movie you've seen 1000 times. It's a DVD, it plays like a DVD. Nothing special about it, just a classic movie.
B000I0QL82|5.0|It's a classic!  I had it on VHS and now DVD.  It's a staple for Christmas movies for the whole family.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I guess after the big fast moving Hunger Games it must have been hard to find another place to take us.  This was a good wrap up to the Games but not as riveting as Games....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well I believe that this is a fun and a wonderful experience for me and my children. We all have a blast playing this game and raising our horses and training them for competitions.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked it ok but not as well as the first....But she caught our attention with The Hunger Games , we'll read them all!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I revived the case and it was not in retail packaging even though in the title it said it would be. I compared it to an other life proof case of the same model that my friend bought at burst buy. There are many subtle differences suggesting it is a knock off for sure. I feel like I have been deceived. I probably will not buy from this company again. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I almost decided to not read the Hunger games serious, but I wanted to see the movie.  I always like to read the book first so I did...and I'm glad I did!  The book was so much better than the movie....the story consumed me.  The characters came to life in my mind!  I loved loved it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best poket edition, app you can get i love this app. and you should to. boom
B005VPRGB0|5.0|I tend to be out of the loop on children's gifts sometimes, but knowing you can never go wrong with Legos for a Lego lover, I tried the Quad Bike.  The first time I saw my nephew after sending this to him as a gift, he had already completed it and he gave me a lesson on the finer points of the suspension, the design, etc. Needless to say, the Quad Bike was a hit and I learned a lot in the process!
B0007MWZEK|2.0|When I originaly order I recieved 2 sweepers, it was my mistake in the order, one has already been sent back.  I will be sending the other one back if the battery can't be solved.  I have an older version of swivel sweeper, they all have the same problem.  the battery is advertized to run 40 minutes, after multible charges the most the batteries will last is 7 minutes  the two new sweepers acted the same.  I called customer service and they gave a suggestion about the contacts on the charger.  But that did not solve the problem.  Cheap batteries, I still have to send the other one back or get a solution with the battery.  Please contact me about this request.<br /> Trygve Hanson  (602) 616-8267 trygvehanson1@hotmail.com
