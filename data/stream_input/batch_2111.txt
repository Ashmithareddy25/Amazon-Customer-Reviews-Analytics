B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a quick read, and I didn't have the book figured out before the half way point.  You will fall in love with Sky and Holder and your heart breaks for them.  Every man should be like Holder!
B002R5QPRI|5.0|I love this movie! Great push-pull romance. Classic Whitney Houston voice. Perfecto!<br />I remember when this movie first came out and people were doubting Whitney's acting ability, I was so glad she proved the critics wrong.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses so this game is perfect for me it also gives me something to do when I'm bored. It is amazing.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show, love the character's,  the plots , the twist,  the action !  Each week it gets better and better !  If you like zombie movies ? You'll  love the &#34; Walking Dead&#34;
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is so addicting. It keeps you wanting more. I can't wait until the new season begins. This has a great cast of characters.
B00B3Q80ZW|5.0|I am a history buff, and an Anglophile.  Everything about this drama holds my rapt attention.  I cannot wait to see what happens next.  I would have liked to have seen some scenes from Matthew and Mary's honeymoon, though.  And, I would have like to have seen them take their vows.  All the expense of the costumes and extras and the flower girls and no vow.  Love Maggie Smith, she steals every scene she is in.  Great writing and  acting.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey, is one of the most wonderful shows I've ever seen, and mostly because Amazon has season 2 before Netflix and I was able to watch it, you made me really happy!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I can hardly wait for book 3! I would rate this one and the 2nd one 5 stars - a must read for anyone who like history and a good story
B004MC8CA2|5.0|what is left that you would want in a bible app?just when you think the app is perfect they add more!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game great graphics you even get to have zebras and unicorns!I love this game and I highly recommend this game!
B0012NO316|5.0|Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton do an exemplary job in this movie. I highly recommend it... You will be entertained...
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Easy read. Makes you think I'm really not that crazy after all. Wish there was more books written so well about mental illness.
0765325950|5.0|I don't usually write reviews I just heard that this book had been negatively review bombed so I wanted to offset that a bit.  If I wasn't doing that I would only have given the book a 4 star rating.  It's a good book and Brandon Sanderson is a better writer than Robert Jordan in my opinion.
B008ODZNLG|5.0|Fantastic movie.  Do not watch if you are hungry, or have no means of getting to a sushi restaurant in 24 hours.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was light and funny and the music and performances were very good.  It was a lot like Glee in a movie format.  It was worth the rent.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|A very simple design that makes using my Kindle more enjoyable. I constantly use the case set to the 45degree angle table top position. It works so well protecting my device, I don't usually give it a second thought.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was easy to read and hard to put down.  I loved it and highly recommend it.  This would be a great book to read while on vacation.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The best book series I have ever read! I would recommend every female adult to read this. Ah-maz-ing is all I have to say!!!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Once again I find Stephen King's mind to be fascinating, with all the crazy twists and turns and tie in's with his other books and characters. The price was excellent and I had no trouble with the download onto my kindle! Love you Amazon!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was amazing. There wasn't.  Part that I didn't like, it had a good story line behind it. Everyone!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I loved Avatar 3D in the movie theater that I wanted the highest quality DVD I could use to view at home.  I do not have a 3D TV or player so Blu-ray is the next best thing.
B0012GMY64|5.0|When I was in elementry school there was a promotion where in each bottle of milk there was a paper tab and if you saved enough of them you could acquire record albums.  My mother loved Andy Williams and especially the song Moon River.  I saved a boat load of these tabs and got this record for my mother.  I purchased it again, and love listening to it for the memories of my youth in doing something for my mother that to this day brings a smile to my heart and soul.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|My wife and I are late to the game on this series. We are happy that we didn't watch this series when it first aired, we wouldn't have been able to stand the suspense of waiting for the next episode, let alone the next season. Almost half way through season 5.
B00000J2PH|5.0|This one of the albums that takes me back to my days in college.  She was a great song writer and singer then and she still is today.
B0049985XW|4.0|Along with Walter Huston who is just outstanding in this role and even outshines the great Bogart in this movie.  His portrayal of the wise old prospector is SO OUTSTANDING!!  A performance which earned a much deserved Oscar.<br /><br />Of course we all know Bogart's work but I've always thought this is his best movie as well as Tim Holt who did a LOT of westerns (some OK some not so much) but brilliant in this movie.<br /><br />All three give their best performances in this picture which is basically a tale of three prospectors who get lucky and then fate and greed intervene.  Absolutely brilliant acting by this trio.<br /><br />The story itself has a good moral and shows us how man reacts to fortune and fate in a realistic and believable way. The music is outstanding as well. It is a bit predictable at points and may have left a few too many scenes on the cutting room floor, but it is a solid and entertaining classic film.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Another great Dr. Panda game.  Both my 5 year old and 2 year old really enjoy this.  It's educational too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm a horse lover for life, and since I can't have 1 of my own, this is the next best thing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fabulous acting, story line- adore this show!!  Difficulty watching it online (buffering) but that may just be our personal wireless
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read every book in this series. Jack Reacher is one of the best characters created. This one failed to live up to his prior books.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|It was difficult for me to finish this book. I loved pillars of the earth and world without end.. Could not put them down. I was so excited to read this book. Way too much historical information and battle information.. Detracted from the storyline greatly.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Thought this would be a great movie, especially with the cast and subject matter. Really rather boring and standard formula movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Season 3 continues with the outstanding acting and story line of the previous seasons.  This series is destined to be a classic.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|The movie wasn't as good as the original and didn't seem to have the amount of music and dancing as the original.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It is great to see our childhood heroes come to life and this movie was fun to watch. My husband and I reminisced.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Okay, first, The Bad: Charlize Theron and Guy Pearce. Both excellent actors, trapped in odd casting and poor scripting. Charlize Theron was supposed to be some intimidating power-bitch, but instead she came across as flat and stale, and I found myself just irritated with her dry delivery for every scene in which she appeared. Guy Pearce: normally love this guy, but why on earth did they feel the need to cast him as a hundred year old man? It's as bad as Jim Carrey as the Grinch or Mike Myers as Cat in the Hat (yes, I realize those are both Dr. Seuss references and yes I mean what I say in comparing them to this). Essentially, why put a big-name actor inside so much makeup (very bad makeup) that you can't even tell it's the big-name actor? No hate on Guy Pearce, but it would have been simpler and more authentic with, uh, a real old guy.<br /><br />The Okay/Good: The story was interesting, and while it bore many resemblances to Alien, it was different enough to feel original (and only as the film went on did I realize just how intentional these ties to the Alien mythos were. Keep in mind, I hadn't read anything up on this movie before watching it). The pacing was a bit off only because things take a while to get moving in the start, but then the climax felt rushed and not fully fleshed out, nor fully explained. Secondly, the viewer only cares (marginally) about a few of the characters; the rest are not much more than your typical rambunctious-obviously-going-to-be-killed-first-expendable-crewmen-types. BUT, this is to be expected material in the sci-fi/semi-military genre.<br /><br />The Great: This movie is very, very pretty. Watching it on Blu-Ray looked fantastic, from the opening sequence of landscape fly-bys to the rich and textured sets within the cave/ship. The CG looked excellent, especially when Fassbender's character unlocks the big pretty universe-planning map thing within the large ship chamber (don't you love my sophisticated vocab in that last sentence?). That's another thing: Michael Fassbender. If I was gay, I would so bang him. In fact, I probably would anyway. He's quite a diverse actor, and plays an excellent android; handsome, detached, fascinated, and eloquent. Also, Noomi Rapace is an exceptionally affecting actress. She plays a woman in extreme distress quite well, and there's plenty for her to be stressed about in this picture. The, ahem, `birthing' scene is squirm-worthy, but brilliant for it's intensity.<br /><br />Overall, tons of fun. Even though it tried in a sudden, last-minute way to throw in some sort of deep, creational/human destiny elements that just fell quite short, it was still a very enjoyable film, and a respectable piece of sci-fi cinema..

B0013D6LEM|5.0|There's nothing better than starting a day with Michael, this is a great album, and I'm thrilled with the app, goood songs, goood price...great addition to my catalog. Love It. or should I say THRILLED With It..... THANk YOU
B002JIOOB2|5.0|Real L Word fan a &#34;must have&#34;. All DVDs were in perfect format and quality was high. Box set is compact and stacks well.
B003UITUVY|5.0|great music, and very good vinyl copy.  good analogue copy.  not too expense.  provides a more natural reproduction than a MP3 itunes type download from a CD
B002M9WW30|4.0|If you love Rocky, underdog movies, set aside a weekend with lots of soft drinks and popcorn. This is a marathon that will knock you out!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series has excellent acting and very poignant stories. The characters are easy to get to know and like-the viewer shares in their decisions ,dilemmas and emotional ups and downs. . The realistic setting and countryside photography adds to the charm of the story line.
0765325950|3.0|I thought that Sanderson lost his way and did not keep up with Robert Jordan's prophecy lines and lost legitimacy as the completing author  I actually, for my own self, rewrote much of the last book, &#34;A Memory of Light&#34; and came to a much more satisfying book.  Most people gave it a high rating because they were relieved to have finished the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game because I'm super creative and you can build just about every thing you can imagine.<br />This is no average game
B001MSMULG|4.0|Having read a number of the Daniel Silva books, I am enjoying this one.  Perhaps for those who have not read any in this series, I would advise starting with the first in the series and coming forward.  I have jumped around & wish I had started at the beginning.  Never the less, excellent book.
0345803485|5.0|Fifty shades of Grey is a well written book! It is a page turner.  E. L. James is an amazing writer!
B0037NVM1I|5.0|This is by far the best movie for Arnold!! It never gets old.  Good story and good graphics especially for when it was made
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E.L. James has done it again!  The story line continues to intrigue and evoke a myriad of thoughts! Excellent read!
B0094K1MH2|2.0|We selected this movie because we thought it would be something we both could watch.  It turned out to be too juvenile for us.  Recommend for younger audience.
0307352153|5.0|Wonderful insightful book.  It will be such a blessing to many, many people.  I only wish that it could be a must read for  ALL educators, daycare providers and parents of quiet children.It has truly touched my heart and lifted my spirit. It is very well written and sprinkled generously with gold nugget treasures. Well Done Susan Cain. Best book I've read in long time.
B008Y6TD5A|3.0|Interesting story, but not enough story-line for the length of the movie.  We chose this movie because of the cast and were not disappointed by their performances.
B005PK56TA|5.0|At first I didn't like the show, But I an glad I have it a chance because I really enjoyed it. Can't wait sour season two to go to prime.
0762412992|5.0|Proud to display this beautiful book along with my others by the Christmas tree but this one stands out with the quality and detail.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this app and now I can't put my kindle down! It's so cool amazing graphics love love love it you have to get it! ;)
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I really liked the book. I just felt as though it took too long to get to the main point of the book, all the drama and excitment was at the end.
B00B99QTM4|5.0|Unlike some comedies that can be watched once and forgotten, this comedy endures and gets better with each viewing. It is a simple plot with a predictable ending, but has warmth and depth. Fortunately the film avoided a silly plot contrivance to explain why Bill Murray must repeat 2/2 everyday. There is really no need to explain it since the real focus is about how he chooses to live each day--and the consequences for each decision. Without being preachy or forced, it lets the viewer ponder eternal questions such as &#34;How I am making the most out of each day?&#34; or &#34;What would life be without long-term consequences for our behaviors.&#34;  Bill Murray plays the role of Phil convincingly. A large supporting cast of familiar actors, including Chris Eliot, Robin Duke, and Brian Doyle Murray, bring the town of Punxsutawny to life, making it a welcome place to revisit.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|\\"My Horse\\" is so realistic that now I'm perfectly content to live in an apt.! Works really well on my HTC EVO, but I had to free up quite a lot of space on my SD card. It was worth it tho! Beauty is a great horse!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|My teenage daughter loved this and I enjoyed watching it with her. It had a few funny moments, a strong main character played well by Anna Kendricks and a fine supporting cast. It just doesn't do much more than the expected with the material. The characters often played stereotypical types and none are developed with much depth or interest. The nerd roommate character seemed like he could have been interesting, but his character disappears until the final act when he resurfaces as a touching plot device. There are no surprises and no standout singing performances. After all the build up for the last competition, the major finale numbers were not very exciting.It might just be that by that point in the movie, the story had run out of steam and the ending was already obvious. Overall, if you enjoy musical numbers, rom-coms, and a bit of teenage angst, you may enjoy this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the people on it I wanted to get carman thats because u can get carmen that is rio.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|All of her best songs are on this one album.  She has been my favorite female rock singer for many years
B005HSL626|5.0|it has a awsomeness in it so I gave it 5 stars. well it is a challenge because. of the bombs and how fast the fruit goes so that is why it is a challenge .I got 200 once and I beat my dad.
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|This is simply the remastered version of the already great album. The superior quality is obvious in higher end sound equipment.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It was okay,need more information on how to play the  game.I like horses a lot,it was not like I throughout it would be .but it was nice the part I did understand.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very easy/enjoyable to read - only have enough time to read for a half hour before bedtime, and this story is easy to put down and then pick up at a later time.  Interested from the first page
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I liked the combination of the unknown mixed with humor. I enjoy series with an on going plot mixed with an interesting individual story in each episode. This series has an excellent cast, special effects and is written with depth that sucks you right in.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book will keep you guessing.....wrongly.....or not. A book that begs to be read in one sitting, because you'll want to know what's coming next, who did what, and why.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Seth MacFarlane is running out of good material. This movie is pushing the envelope trying to be funny and its obvious. I would judge anyone who says they like this movie.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This thing is awesome. Only down side is the \\"battery low\\" warning. When it needs a charge every 5 seconds it says it. But that is so minor. Great sound quality.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Less tongue in cheek and more dark it could have been better.  The writing feels different (less cohesive) and more like elements stitched together (with a couple of gaps).  The camera work is gorgeous and heavily stylized and probably  my favorite attribute of the film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved all three of the books in this exciting futuristic trilogy. Sure, the movie was good, but the book is so much more.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|I think this is a very well made game. The controls are great, the graphics are crisp, and there are lots of little details to be found. However, the game play is extremely limited. Very soon after the game throws its first curve at you, it becomes a game of &#34;turtle cannon&#34;/&#34;hit the chicken with a bat&#34; to see how far you can get. Usually you get eaten fairly quickly. Maybe you make it a bit higher than your record, but not unless you are lucky. If it was not 99¢, this would be a 3 star game, but for its value and the RPG style power up shop, I give it 4.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|The authors have a unique way providing perspectives and strategies related to change.  It would be helpful if there were more examples of companies/organizations actually practicing to &#34;switch.&#34;
B0037NVM1I|5.0|It is an excellent sequel.  I highly suggest it to anyone.  Of course, you should watch Terminator before watching this movie!  You will be glad that you watched them both.
B002QNTNL6|5.0|This is a real funny feel good movie. It has been out a while but is time less. Real good
B008Y78M60|5.0|Great story, great acting and cinematography.  An interesting side story to Lincoln's assassination that I didn't know about.  Must see!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|I love these books. The characters are so diverse and each worm their way into your heart. Granted there is a lot of death and deceit as well...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Yes I really meant to write \\"lovely.\\" Not a word you would ordinarily associate with Stephen King's novels, is it? I have read Stephen King's books since I was in my late 20s. Since I'm the same age as King, that is a LONG time. 11/22/63 took me back to a happier time, and up to one of the darkest days in American history and back again. It made me cry and it made me smile. It took my breath away. I will read it again.
B00170F0WU|5.0|Movie was great, but tons of problems with streaming and delays. will probably stick to other streaming products in the future
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Movie was okay.. got real slow in parts.. very tragic character.  I'd might watch it again but not a first choice.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Only one good video can't search any thing and is very annoying do get the app . . . .
B000OXHRRC|2.0|It didn't really seem to know the best way to get where it wanted to go. I didn't get attached to the characters enough to care what happened to them, even though it was very obvious what was going to happen. Plot was on a straight, dead-end, predictable road.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love doodle god but the graphics even on child safety mode aren't kid appropriate. Can you speed up with the updating?
B00B49L7JY|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of documentaries (they've become preaching in the last several years), but this movie is an exception. There is so much that is real in this story that it makes it beautiful. Sugar Man is one of the good things about the information age.
B0063GORYU|5.0|omg great game just love playing it very changling  great game to play when you have nothing to do like being in a doctors office
B009329ZF2|3.0|If you're in the mood for a blast 'em, no heavy thinking, the U.S.A. is going to miraculously overcome a formidable foe movie, then this is entertaining. I have to add that I don't listen to Rhianna's music, but she better stick to it in light of her acting in this movie. I will give big kudos to the special effects, which were better than I expected. And yes, I had a strong desire to play the game Battleship when it was over.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this is the best app ever it gives you weather when ever you need in what ever area you need when ever you need it great app
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The thing I like about the Fringe series is that they maintain a plot thought the series, yet still manage to have cases that are seemingly not related.  Well done, with an interesting cast.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is fun and very realistic. It shows you how to take care of a horse.I would recommend this game fir all ages because it is nice and safe.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|I watch this when I don't have anything else recorded that I want to watch.<br /><br />I find Amazon TV programs harder to search than Netflix.  Cumbersome.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love horses and when im not at a barn im playing with my virtual horse this game is truely awesome
B003Z49LYO|4.0|Gemma is note-perfect as Tess.  The tone of the series is also faithful to Hardy's dark (precociously modern) sensibility, but not so much that this adaptation is less enjoyable than most period pieces.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book was great l could not stop reading this book I recommend it to everybody so buy this book
B0028R765A|5.0|Love superhero movies? This is one of the best ever made. Rare for a movie to be able to get you so invested in totaly new characters the way this one does.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a captivating read and interesting from many different facets. I would recommend this book to any one struggling to decide who they really are in life.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|Very addictive show.  Just the right amount of drama, intrique, love and suspense.  I felt like I was there myself
B009YQJ322|4.0|designed to be very early in Dredd's carreer; Karl Urban is Dredd.  the only thing that the producers of the movie slipped up on was to make it for a more adult audience and thus missed out on a pg-13 rating and a signifigant 13-16 audience demographic share.  could have been the next big franchise as Dredd fans were hoping for a series that didn't kill every villain in a single blow as  the Stallone movie did.  all that said a great movie.
0062238868|5.0|Strait forward information on the subject(s) covered - Found the book to keep my interest throughout the book.  Book met my expectations of the authors ability to write such a book.
0446547573|4.0|A refreshing change for Nicholas Sparks, who often seems to subscribe to the same formula in his books. This one is not as predictable, and even when you think you have something figured out there's an extra twist that you likely won't see coming. My only real complaint is that the main story line is a lot like \\"Sleeping With the Enemy\\" (if you're familiar with the Julia Roberts movie), but these characters feel a little more developed and worth investing in to see where things go. Eager to see the movie since I love Josh Duhamel, although they cast his part younger than the Alex in the book (or at least didn't give him the same gray hair!). Worth reading- it will keep you up wanting to find out what happens.
B00797MB0O|5.0|This is a simply terrific sleeper of a film--smart, unblinking, and deeply insightful.  The casting and acting are first-rate.  What a pleasant surprise . . . and experience.
0316227706|5.0|The faces of Underwater Dogs had everyone in the family laughing helplessly.  The book was a gift for my husband, but everyone enjoyed it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Absolutley love this app! Have had no problems with it, and love the game. :)<br />The premise of the game is not the greatest influence for younger kids (you got caught tagging a train, and you're being chased by a police officer and his dog), and some of the characters are inappropriately dressed.<br />But other than that, the graphics are great, and controls are great. Have had no problems with my Kindle Fire.<br />Love the game, just wish there were better dressed characters and a better premise. :)
158234082X|5.0|Although I've watched Anthony Bourdain for years on his TV Travel Channel show \\"No Reservations\\" I did not realize his initial fame came as the author of \\"Kitchen Confidential\\" until I saw this book and couldn't resist getting it. What an intriguing expose of the New York food industry, from the first page to the last, albeit over the course of 35 years. If you've ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of well-known restaurants as wekk as those barely getting by, this is the book that will answer your curiosity. Bourdain is boastful; he's arrogant yet self-deprecating, but most of all he's an entertaining storyteller with a flair for writing well in a casual style peppered with profanity.

B007THA4FI|2.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed the Harry Potter series and appreciating Rowling's success in engaging a generation of new, young readers, I was very disappointed in the book. I expected a similar level of engagement with the characters.  Perhaps Rowling should stick to writing for kids.

030758836X|5.0|I have read all of Gillian Flynn's Novels.<br />She is truly gifted.<br />Where her gift lies is in writing about 'broken people.'<br />In this I feel she is unparalleled.<br />Her last two novels were more about the broken. In this novel we find the breaking.<br /><br />This book is her most 'mainstream effort.'<br />I don't mean this in a bad way, but it simply is. Note the wider cast to a larger audience and hell...they bit that hook.<br />Flynn writes a narrative that is so engrossing that I literally found it almost impossible to put down. I carried the book with me everywhere and once I hit the last 150 pages there was no interrupting my read. I was entranced.<br /><br />She brought me into the worlds of her two main characters-Nick and Amy.<br />I felt as though I was there for every word, every pinch, every little thing they did and all the people they spoke with were mine to touch, smell, feel and hear.<br /><br />The tension in this book is palpable and, if you are like me, you will be trying to figure it out from page one without intentionally doing so. Enjoy that because in a snap you are there.<br /><br />This book is a brilliant thriller that never stops moving, The pace is so fast that I dare you to make it a week without having finished it (I read this in a couple of days with full-time work, two young kids, a full-time job, etc.)<br /><br />I squirmed, I swooned, I pitched, and I fell with all of it.<br /><br />As for my 5-start rating, it really should be more of a 4.5 star due to a lot of 'suspend your disbelief' moments, but a book is to entertain is it not? A book is to move you. It is to take you to new heights and new lows and keep you so that you don't want it to end.<br /><br />This book accomplishes this in every way and so 5-stars is what it deserves.<br />Thank you Ms. Flynn. I cannot wait until you write another.

0425252868|5.0|My husband read this book.  He was so engrossed every night I couldn't get more than a word or two out of him until he finished it. He thought it was excellent.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I went through the first 6 seasons (available on VUDU) in a couple of weeks and am anxiously awaiting season 7 which I pre-ordered.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good idea to have come up with. I really want the next book because it is so good.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I started reading the series because my 28 year old daughter was talking about it.  Was pleasantly surprised and got very hooked and couldn't stop reading (on my smart phone at the time)  until I reached the end of this 4th book to know what happened.  The books were a totally different genre than I had ever read before, but no I am hooked and have tried to find other series that are similar to The Twilight Saga.  Fantastic series and I was sad to see the end.  I Loved it:
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I love the red cover, I can spot it quickly, it protects my Kindle Fire and gives me the support to set it on the table for hands free use.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Basically the same program as my smart phone app.  Have not really used the app the much, but I do like the set up and I know the phone app works fabulous, so I am sure this one will too.
B0011EP0S6|4.0|I liked it I'll watch it again , I've been to Dublin so it brought back memories , and it had a feel good feeling
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I don't always get time to go on my computer to check facebook and I receive a lot of messages.  This app for the Kindle Fire is fantastic.  It saves me the hassle of trying to read everything on my phone which is so small to read!  It also lets me see the pictures of my grandkids in a normal photo size!!  So the bottom line is I Love It!!
B004W2V254|5.0|I loved this movie, excellent shots, i recommend it, this is not the classic good and bad caracters, and inspired in true events, really good
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not really a big game player, downloaded this app and others, wanted to see what all the hype was about, it is a fun game, but I really haven't played it that much, so still trying to get it.  Maybe I'll get
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome ending to some good books. It tied everything into a cute little bow.must read all three of the fifty books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app - I can access Pinterest anywhere there is a wireless connection!  This is I believe my most favorite app currently.  I love looking at all the different ideas in quilting, sewing, gardening areas.  I'm looking for things for my dream sewing room - not the basic shape of the room to be built, just the storage units and how to set up the sewing machines and any other miscellaneous items needed.  It's amazing how many ideas you can come up with for food, decorating, etc. Love, Love, Love this app!
0802473156|5.0|Truly explained so many behaviors for me.  Personally am NOT a psycho-babble fan, but this book gives concrete examples of how to really love your spouse, family members and friends in ways that can appreciate.  Just one question.  Where's the chapter on FOOD as a  love language???
6305128952|5.0|awesome movie if you love horses.  my family can watch it over and over. very emotional. we watch it often.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The beginning and set up of \\"Gone Girl\\" was good.  As the story progressed there were many twist and turns.  The novel is very well written.  I agree with the author, it is \\"Nick and me\\" not \\" Nick and I.\\" But, it there were so many twist and turns that the suspense and drama became comical.  Laugh out loud funny.<br /><br />REALLY!!!
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|Another great read from Mitch Albom.  Just like his other books, this was easy to read and I found it hard to put down. I like that Mitch Albom always has the ability to make his books draw on real life examples so you can relate to them easily. If you liked his other books, you will enjoy this.
0765325950|5.0|Very satisfied with this book.  I waited forever for this final book to conclude the series, so glad to finally get it!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|The graphics are great and everything and it has a lot more obstacles. The one thing that is a deal-breaker for me though is the fact that EVERY time I play a game and then go back to my menu my coins are gone. I had 2600 coins and played one game and when I came back to the menu I had only 400 coins. Why???
B003O86FMW|5.0|What an entertaining read about love in the midst of rebellion...just when we thought Katniss was out of the Hunger Games!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|A well-told story of a young girl trying to run away from a difficult past. Lots of sadness and tears. I do like how the author portrays her characters. You can't help but feel for them. It took me a while to figure out what had actually happened, but when it was explained, it made perfect sense to me. I liked the ending.
B00005JPS8|4.0|Got all the folms and likrd a lot the buy .. Thanks . A v e n g e r s
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading all three books, I can say that it has had a huge impact on my marriage. We had hit a slump and it was same old same old. Our passion for each other is renewed. These books were a great read and I look forward to more.
B001DHXT20|4.0|Got all the folms and likrd a lot the buy .. Thanks . A v e n g e r s
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good story, Good mini games, fun all around!graphics are surprisingly good on cut scenes and the hidden item portion isn't boring and easy like a lot of these games
B00003CX5P|4.0|Star Wars  is one of my films ... Liked a lot the buy . . . May the force be irh you
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Never watched this when it was active.  Like Abrams other cult classic, Lost, this pushes the envelope for the thinking man's TV drama.  Unlike Lost, it doesn't jump the shark ever third episode.<br /><br />We've witnessed a golden age of television in the Aughts, where TV writing was superior to the Theatrical releases.  Fringe is one of the reasons why.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Got all the folms and likrd a lot the buy .. Thanks . A v e n g e r s
B00846REIS|1.0|It had no plot - the characters were pretty pathetic in my opinion.  not very well written.  Not worth the time or $.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Got all the folms and likrd a lot the buy .. Thanks . A v e n g e r s
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Excellent book! This book was very thoughtfully written and insightful, it's not just another historical recitation but a personal history of two combatants and their experiences and personal struggles throughout the war.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|Got all the folms and likrd a lot the buy .. Thanks . A v e n g e r s
B007THA4FI|4.0|I thought it might be as much fun as the Harry Potter series. It was a good read but sad, very sad. It left me wanting to read something that was funny and ended happily.
1410412970|5.0|I love Frederick's character and I really enjoyed this view into a possible perspective from Wentworth.<br />Its a quick read, but something you think about after if you view the videos or re-read Jane.<br />Worth the time.<br />The publisher version was a nice surprise- easy to read, hold and shelve!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|a great insiders look into what we never hear or read about. we need to understand a great deal more about the private thoughts regarding their job.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. My five year old even loves it. Good hand eye cordnation. Very entertaining. Gets the<br />whole family wanting to compete.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This is a good kid's movie.  The message is good and universal for kids of all ages, even old ones like me.
B0095P29EG|3.0|Cool effects and entertaining story... Fairly predictable, but if you are looking for some light entertainment, this is fun to watch.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple and easy to use. Does all the basic functions I need it to do. I really appreciate the big buttons.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like minecraft a lot. It is really fun. It brad ran time. The only bad thing is that when you have over two players it lags a lot. But it is still fun.
0525478817|5.0|A heartbreaking and perfect exploration of love at its best, expressed through people living with one of the worst challenges life can offer.  So beautifully written I read it twice in two days!
B0099114WO|2.0|Very disappointing.  I was expecting a lively comedy, instead I found the movie sad and depressing.  A few entertaining moments but this is not a movie I would watch again.  Very happy I bought the DVD instead of paying the price to see this at the theatre.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|We love this game. It can be easy for little kids and harder for adults.  We have this game on all of our smart phones and Kindle.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a awesome game fun and awesome this is a fast paced game. And keeping you on your toes. You will love it.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Great movie if interested in conspiracy movie fast action show.<br />Great sound track very good at holding my interest all thru Shooter
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Very nice, entertaining movie.  Would watch it again. When did we stop having movies like this;  we need to have more!
B00B1R8TCM|4.0|Harper has a firm grasp of where American music comes from and he's a fine musician.  This album is as good as anything he has done previously and Musselwhite is the icing on the cake.  I have to admit though, I like Harper better when he's good and cranked up about something, like he was with the Relentless 7.  He's really good at making that slide guitar growl and wail.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Cleese and company are hilarious each and everytime we watch. We wish there had been more episodes. John is a true comic genius.
B008AUGEFC|2.0|This is one instance when I wish I had seen the movie before reading the book so I could actually see the characters.  They didn't exude much empathy or sympathy in this six-sided novel.  The book also seems written like a script. Maybe I should have been warned when the writer mentioned Zen Koan or the poem \\"Brahma\\" by Emerson at the beginning of the book.  It was not a pleasant read but I stuck with it. No doubt David Mitchell is a brilliant writer, being English and all, but this wildly swinging back and forth in time, dialog, and characters didn't appeal to me.  Thank goodness for the internet so I could look up words no longer used. As the author says: \\"Travel far enough you meet yourself.\\" I took the journey through \\"Cloud Atlas\\" and now I know I don't like time travel books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome.  Love it it's like temple run but your running for not your life but for you not to get in jail for life I recommend it :)
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Very successful at holding and carrying one's attention.  I would have enjoyed a bit less death, but it was enjoyable.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I'm a senior.  Keeping the brain, active and stimulated is of upmost importance.  This game does that, plus stimulating visual skills and stategic planning.  Plus, it's free and just plain fun.  Doesn't get much better than that.  The same review was submitted for Move It! for the same reasons.
B005X5XIL0|4.0|Amazingly well done in an outdoor setting. Felt like I was there and could see even better. Loved Amazing Grace, when he said &#34;I was blind, but now I see.&#34;
B00992CF6W|3.0|dosent have buckets, obisisien or barley any lava and it dosent have endermen. but other than that its freaking awesome
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this app. I have a book in there for notes. So if a page in my homework gets ruined I can rewrite it because it's saved on here. GET THIS APP!
B008P3SPVU|4.0|Most stories of struggles in the tougher parts of our worlds get lost in their own self importance. Samuel Jackson does a great job, with tutelage from the real Coach Carter, of capturing the challenges of working with kids who come from families and neighborhoods where hope is less than mid-stream America. Though I thought Jackson's father-son relationship must have been incredibly trying and could have been delved into more there, the interaction amongst the coach, his players and the powers that be made for an engrossing story that was filled with important take aways.
B0040I09RM|4.0|I started watching this as pay back for all the chick flicks my husband watches with me.  It's a fast paced show with lots of action/ violence. Some of the scenes are a little far fetched but the cast really portrays the characters very well. The suspense leaves you wanting more.
B009PU2KIQ|2.0|I love the blues and had heard all about Gary Clark Jr and was all excited to hear from the \\"future of the blues\\". Well someone gave me a copy of this cd and I was glad I did not pay for this pile of garbage and for any other blues fan like me lets hope he is not the future of the blues because if he is the Blues is DOOMED.. This is not even close to a blues cd and maybe he was not going for that who knows but I will avoid anything else he releases like the plauge. I am not sure if there is a good track on this album so buy it at your own risk.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this show! Love the time period and how people think and lived back then so awesome. Good show to watch!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds, what more can I say? I think I'm the last person to ever play it. I can see just what all the fuss is about.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good to  pass time with and keep you busy..<br />Love card themes and the visual that makes playing on the k kindle wonderful
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe is a fantastic show- not without its problems, yes, but overall one of the most solid pieces of tv I've seen in a long whiel
B008K4JDLA|5.0|This is an intelligent, well written account of the increasing potential of anyone with a computer to create the digital instructions to create physical items in the same way we are used to creating, publishing or printing documents at home. As 3d printers become more ubiquitous and cheaper and as more manufacturers offer the possibility to act as '3D print bureaus' a revolutionary effect on the future manufactured goods is in prospect. Fascinating. A must-read for designers and anyone interested in creating 'things'. Contains lots of links and information on resources for those interested in further exploration.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|This is one film that I will never get tired of watching, one of the best of all time! And I've  seen the best...from the early day's, this one is for 3d and story...great film!!
B00821OX98|4.0|Awesome. Caught his late in season and am now doing catch up. Hope they continue like Fringe has done. Don't want a cancelled season anywhere in near future..........
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I really enjoy this British drama. The characters are very intriguing and the plot is well developed. I have not watched the original show but love this remake!
0062197266|4.0|From page one this book was hook, line and sinker. Its the fastest moving, well developed thriller I've read since Watson's Before I go to Sleep. The first 75 pages are a tad confusing as you discover how Haynes is building her story, but once I caught on to the flow and figured the present characters name things flew by smoothly. For me the hardest aspect about reading this book (outside of the obsessive murderous creep) was the inability to relate to main character Catherine. She was certainly a dynamic character who boldly walks the reader through Dark's frightening tale, but due to the way the story was told and the constant shifting between past present, Catherine was always a hard to follow combination of two characters, the before and the after.<br /><br />Her before character irritated me with her flippant attitude about sex and men, her nightly mission to be drunk and have sex with random strangers was a big turn off and easily you could blame her carefree personality for attracting a dangerous relationship into her life, however I think perhaps this was the authors intent, not so much the danger of casual sex but the carefree attitude so many people have about their own safety. The private information we so easily give away and the easiness of which a person can stalk, find and torment another by way of Internet, work or public places. In the after Catherine was 180 degrees different, going from the happy wild woman to the reclusive agoraphobia character we are left with. It was often sad to see what this man did to the vivacious character we meet in the beginning, but it also signified the importance of who we actually let into our life and who we really trust.<br /><br />Into the Darkest Corner could be summarized into one word: RIVETING. However I think a more fitting word would be terrifying and not in the sense of a slasher flick horror movie but real world horror, the type that makes you check the locks before bed and makes you think twice about that good looking guy next door.....or that hot man at the gym who always smiles. I think the Miami Herald worded it the best by saying this book was and I quote \\"A terrifying tale of modern relationships\\".<br /><br />Grow your nails out so you have something to bite on cause this tale is one you don't want to miss.good looking guy next door.....or that hot man at the gym who always smiles. I think the Miami Herald worded it the best by saying this book was and I quote \\"A terrifying tale of modern relationships\\".<br /><br />Grow your nails out so you have something to bite on cause this tale is one you don't want to miss.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a wonderfully game!! easy to adjust to, fun, and a cool way to waste a few hours! lol
B006O2QNOU|5.0|Good acting by an ensemble cast of seasoned actors plus memorable acting by a couple of younger actors made this a pleasure to watch. The 'story' one of economic collapse in our own time is a play by play of the fall of Lehman Bros through mismanagement and greed. I enjoyed it very much.
B008M36EEI|5.0|Great movie, highly recommend watching! Very meaningful and uplifting. I did not even want to fall asleep while watching. Perfect!
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I really like the application navigation.  Listening to streaming music stations is excellent, but I really wanted an application that would allow me to listen to podcasts. It does, but a pause of the channel may require you to start over. It doesn't fast-forward well. The application terminates when my phone associates with a WAP.  I would still recommend it for listening to different newscasts and music from around the world.<br />The selection of stations is fantastic and the categorization is efficient. It just needs some better exception handling.
B0081336FO|5.0|I hope the next season is just as good. These actors are great and keep me interested. Also would like to see Sherlock cut his hair! Lol
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|it is a good game to help pass down time. if your playing for free it takes a lot of time to progress
B004BCNVOA|5.0|I was disappointed with Pinks album \\" I'm not dead\\" to the point that I started to see her differently, but this album is much better and I can workout to it over and over. I even ran a half marathon with this inspiration of lyrics. Recommend you listen to it with an open mind.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A good story.  Easy read with twists and turns.  Some things you see coming, some you don't.  It doesn't strain your brain too much but it certainly keeps your interest.  I've just started this series and hope to add Mr Childs to my list of favorite authors.  I'm a Clancy and Sanford fan, primarily just so you know where I'm coming from.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Can't wait to see what happens next season. It is such a mystery on how Sherlock is so intelligent. Great actors!
B006RJTIF6|5.0|Watch this, Fail Safe, and Dr. Strangelove, and maybe Suddenly, and you have a handle on the Cold War era. Nowadays, one can see this film in a whole new light--and the Burt Lancaster character seems less a bad guy! Hmmm.
B004WR125O|5.0|I plug this adapter to my onkyo 7.2 receiver to update it, follow the onscreen directions with no problems, this product is easy to set-up with any compatable onkyo receiver, my receiver is always online using this wireless lan adapter. thanks onkyo for another great product. I will recomend this product to any of my freinds or family
B00902S0IS|5.0|I saw this in the theater in its original release with a pass from the back of a cereal box. Many subsequent movies owe a debt to FP. Besides being a clever rewrite of Classic literature, the effects are good for its time and even hold up reasonably well into the 21st century. Add The Thing, Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds, Them, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and you'll understand the 1950's.
0071373586|4.0|This book help only in the fact that it was part of many I have read but on it's own not alot o help.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is both awesome and addicting it is one of my favorite games on a mobile device and it's cool they have a version for the kindle
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This was indispensable when I was out of the country for two months and only had an iPad with little storage.  Files were  always at my fingertips.  Getting files revised were a cinch and could  always be downloaded in their updated form in all computers on which this app is installed.  The free 2G storage is also surprisingly ample.  I have more than 100 doc and jpg files and  they haven't  even made a dent on my memory allotment.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|A look into the mind of Robert S. McNamara and his look back as Secretary of Defense under Kennedy/Johnson.<br /><br />Revealing.  Well worth the time.  McNamara, a decent man caught up in the jaws of history.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|It has good size to carry the basic stuff and a little bit more! Wasn't sure at first but it's a perfect fit
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Would watch it again and again!!!  Too cute!!!  Great love story that overcomes great differences.  Great for kids and adults.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|NDM is one of my favorite authors and John Corey is a great character but this book is not one of NDM's best.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is great for all horror fans! It's like watching a never ending horror movie! The plot is captivating and there is never a dull moment.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This is an interesting story well told.  I will probably try his next book. Here are the six additional words.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I loved book 1, tolerated book 2, and read book 3 because by then, I was vested. Very marginal at best. Wraps up some plot loose ends but they aren't believable, even for fiction.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie is awesome!  Lot's of action and very worth seeing.  The actors are excellent!  Will keep you interested and wishing their was a sequal or something.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Book 1 was great, and this book was o-kay. If you try to overanalyze the likelihood of a 28 year old billionaire, you'll take all the fun out of it. Just enjoy the ride. It's called fiction.
B008X6JP3G|4.0|Kevin Costner is excellent in this movie.  Lot's of action and unpredictable ending.  Excellent streaming from Amazon video.  Would recommend.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|This book compares to everyday life. It really has you thinking about pursuing your dream, and talks about all the obstacles you have to face. I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My opinion is it is great fun enjoying and I think you will so that's mine but it is your heart and mind not mine we our all different and if you treat others how you want to be treated you get the same respect .
B008Y7G6UO|5.0|No matter how many times I see this movie, it's great! I'm sure Ill view it again in the future.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|The Verso Kindle cover designed by Sharyn Sowell is made of supple leather-like material. It feels good in your hands. It is thick enough to protect my Kindle from getting nicked inside my purse. The straps are nice and tight so they don't allow the Kindle to slide around. Cities around the world are inscribed all over the outside which makes it a world traveler's dream!<br />The only thing I don't care for is the lower right strap partially covers the 5-way so it is difficult to play games on my Kindle with it in the case.
B000L53D4O|4.0|Gave it as a gift for Christmas. I hope the toddler that received it had fun with it. We purchased two.
B007704HO6|5.0|Fantastic read!  A heartwarming story.  This book will make your day.<br />A very intelligent cat. An interesting true story.  Very hard to put down.
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|To me trailers for this were misleading.  This is mainly the story of an alcoholic, and too long and drawn out as well. Not subtle either, with the main character having a bottle in hand in just about every scene. The scenes of the ill-fated flight were compelling, but those seemed like a small part of this movie that often dragged, predictably so.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Great movie to watch on computer. My son needed to watch this for a school project, and the price is right.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I have seen Frank Lloyd Wright buildings but had not heard about his life.  Very informative and interest to read.  Surprised at his life style.  Ending was sad.  I will now go visit the house on the rocks to see the fire door.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|My son and I are big fans of this series and he hinted that he wanted to purchase this. I surprised him and bought it. We continue watching it over and over!
B0052AC8C6|4.0|The movie itself is well made and very entertaining. Has amazing CGI to keep up with the best of them. When the scenery wasn't keeping my attention, the comedy was, and then the action started. Given all this, I would highly recommend it. This much I expected from a Johnny Depp movie and why I gave it four stars.<br /><br />However, due to language and violence this is not a child's movie and should not be treated as one. This movie also slanders Christians as robotic fools worshiping a pagan-like idol (water), religion in general by all the references to \\"salvation\\", Mexicans, American capitalists, Appalachian people as idiots and other gratuitous stereotypes. This much I also expected from a Johnny Depp movie and is why I didn't detract any stars for it. Sad, but it's Hollywood, and moral degradation is simply what we get for entertainment these days. I can't knock a movie because I get what I expect.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|There was alot of great insight into the training of Navy Seals.  It was a little confusing as far as the time line jumping around at first, but the account of the raid and killing of Bin Laden was awesome.
0670026603|5.0|This story is so heart-felt and moving, I still can't get over the ending. I love that the characters are real and that the story makes you relate to a life situation in a very powerful way. There are parts of this story that I just couldn't help but smile and laugh out loud, like when Will attends his ex's wedding and takes to the dance floor.  You just can't help but cheer him on.  Even in his wheelchair, he has such dignity, you can see the powerful person he was before his accident and what still makes him tick. His caregiver Lou is funny in everything she does, but is so compassionate and caring for Will, it will break your heart as she goes out of her way to give him a happy life. The story is wonderfully thought provoking and will touch your heart. Be prepared to laugh and cry a lot and think about the characters long after you finish the book!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book! Great Story and ending! Nicholas Sparks again did a great job! Can't wait to watch the movie!
B00821OX98|4.0|Overall for a television show, the CG is ok. The plot isnt revolutionary but it is an interesting spin on survival horror that is relatively low on human on human violence. Is it perfect? No, but it is much better than most of the things you can find on the SciFi channel (SyFy).
1430233834|1.0|This book is a complete waste of time. I will have to buy another book to learn what they claim to teach. Many of the exercises are incorrect and do not work.
B00003CXTG|3.0|As a WW2 Veteran, I wanted to see what the recent Hollywood attempts to tell about the early phase of the War.  It turned out to be basically a love triangle, and not a very good one.  I preferred &#34;In Harm's Way&#34;.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|An easy engaging read....feel good ending...just what I expect from Grisham...not jaw dropping use of language, but good plot driven entertainment.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Why doesn't the draw something app work on the kindle fire?  The app comes up to download it yet it doesn't work?
B004BLDD9Y|5.0|This is the way to the Future if we are going to save Energy and Resources. Bulb fits a regular socket .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Quick and enjoyable read! Nicholas Sparks has done it again. Can't wait to see the movie, hope it is just as good!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Fast pace, full of unexpected moments, and romance. Great read. I hope they make a movie from this book it would be amazing.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I though that this book was a wonderful and interesting. I enjoyed it very much.<br />Roald Dahl is a wonderful author with an amazing imagination.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Have wanted this for a long time and got a super deal on it !!! If you love the 70's time era shows this is a must for your collection !! Just one more thing ............ just kidding !! God bless !!
B0007TKNII|5.0|A very enjoyable movie that was well acted, well sung and stayed very true to all things Phantom!  I would suggest this to anyone who enjoys a good musical.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|One of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time !!! Keeps you gripped in the story throughout the film !! Denzel is one of my favorites and did not let me down in the least !!! So worth watching I may watch it again tonight and I rarely watch the same movie in that close a time frame !!! Enjoy !!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book as always. He always gets a person thinking about what really goes on behind the scenes in this country.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've had it for a year now and it is so accurate I also like the fact that you can go 10-12 days ahead to check the weather. I would highly recommend this app for the Kindle Fire.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Kind of boring. Although the idea for the story is kind of interesting it was well written, I just feel like for a 25 year old its a little too teen, girly, not very romantic, drawn out, predictable and a little too much of unnecessary drama. I dont know who put it in a similar genre as &#34;fifty shades of grey&#34; or even to &#34;bared to you&#34;. Its not even close to any of those books. Anyway, think for yourself.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|This app is ok. Sometimes it is funny and other times it is super annoying. I would recommend this app to people who have little kids
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Didn't expect this to be about substance abuse the preview indicates that only as a small part of the movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome because one of the characters is named after me Carmen so I am trying to get her.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is very addictive.I thought I would have to wait until I was 13 to write a review on the app store I have. This is awesome. I get the second one.

B00003CX5P|5.0|I bought this movie for a friend of mine who does not have a computer. She really enjoyed seeing this film again.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If you like Scy Fi, this is a great show.  Enjoyed it when it was first run, enoyed just as much streaming.
B001P06GX4|5.0|One of the best games out there, I bought one for the family, I ended buying three more for various gifts.
0765365278|4.0|I've read a few of the negative reviews here and at Goodreads and some commonalities seem to be: Sanderson is showing off by doing world-building, there are too many main characters, and some of the ostensibly humorous dialogue wasn't actually humorous. I would respond by saying that extensive world-building isn't showing off for some of us. We actually like to explore different worlds. If that isn't your thing then, yeah, skip this book. As far as the number of characters, I didn't find it at all challenging to keep them straight. My big concern is that this problem may actually be an issue in the future since Sanderson is planning a 10 book series. One of the reasons I quit the Wheel of Time series was the quantity of \\"main\\" characters that I had to keep up with. I would constantly be thinking to myself \\"Am I supposed to remember this person or is this a new character?\\" That's not a good sign. I didn't have that problem with this book, but it may be a problem as the series continues to expand. I hope not because I really enjoyed this book. The complaint about some of the dialogue I actually agree with. There were definite clunkers in the dialogue, particularly in some cases where I think I was supposed to laugh. That's a pretty minor problem. You're gonna have some duds in your dialogue. I can live with that.<br /><br />  The question for me is always, \\"Are these characters I care about and would want to know?\\" (Another reason I dropped the Wheel of Time series. Is there a single female character in that series who wouldn't drive you to stab yourself in the throat with your heron-mark blade?) In this book I really liked several of the characters and cared about what was happening to them. With any book of 1000 pages you enter it with a little trepidation wondering if you're going to get bored or if it will bog down at some point. The beginning is a little slow as it introduces our protagonists, but that is a pretty common problem and it honestly didn't drag very long in my opinion. I found myself wanting to continue reading. I always felt like I had to put the book down rather than feeling like, \\"Okay that's enough for now.\\" That's a good enough indication for me that it's a good book. I would happily reread it.
1582701709|5.0|I did buy this book after I watched the movie. It have a summary of inspirational messages tucked in small book. It will make a big difference in setting the tone for the day.
0823004325|4.0|Had the previous version of the book and find this one to be a little more complete. Good way to develop under lying drawings for paitings.
B007THA4FI|3.0|i chose this book because of the author.  parts of it were very good, especially the character descriptions.  the plot line about the teenagers was particularly engaging to me, since i am a teacher of at-risk youth.  the local politics took up much of the book, and it became tedious.  overall, it was worth reading, but there was too much detail for me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I cannot get enough of this wonderful series. The second season is even better... all actors are excellent. I recommend this series highly for anyone interested in great acting and period pieces. Maggie Smith is amazingly funny!
B007SOQBCM|4.0|I have the Twitch TV app on my ipod touch 5th gen device and the latest release is really good on that OS.  I got a Kindle fire HD 7 for my birthday, checked the app store and was excited that they had the app.  I was totally surprised when I started the Kindle fire HD version, that most of the Apple IOS features are missing.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-You can't log into your twitch account and watch the people your registered to follow there<br />-There is no chat available like on the IOS version<br />- The no log on combined with the no chat means premium subscribers to twitch won't get the premium features they paid for.<br />- Many of Twitch's categories are missing that you would find on their web page.  It seems to be a limited set of streams or games available to view. (More so than the IOS version)<br />- A little glitchy.  Some of the streams won't open and some only run at 220/240p<br /><br />Pro's:<br />- Sometimes it will open streams that the IOS version has trouble with.<br />- There seem to be no commercials!<br />- 720p streams look fantastic on the Kindle fire HD screen and the sound is great too!<br /><br />Even with the cons I still rate it at 4 stars because, its free and there are still some great streams to watch.<br /><br />Hope they continue to improve the kindle version!
B004R13U6Y|3.0|This app has a bunch of great features, but takes some serious getting used to. Most frustrating has to be opening an email attachment and being met with the \\"won't be saved\\" greeting.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) Dual page reading. Great for books with smaller pages and larger typeface.<br />2) Highlighting text.<br />3) Annotations (which i'm using for notes and pronunciations)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) The flipping of pages is smooth-ish at best and, even at it's fastest speed (Level 3), is still too slow to permit comfortable reading out aloud (never mind silently). The only solution is to flip the page at the start of the final line of text and hope that it'll be done (and you've memorized the line before it disappears) to make for a continuous read over the page.<br /><br />2) Getting the menu to pop up is touch and go. Sometimes it does, sometimes I can only end up flipping pages back and forth.<br /><br />3) Search doesn't work for me at all - though I don't see anyone else complaining, so maybe it's just mine..? I enter the word, hit the search icon and away it goes, scanning pages (I see the numbers climbing on the bottom left) But it never finds the word. Anywhere. I tried the name of the central character, which is mentioned hundreds of times in a 980 pg book and... nothing. Not a single result.<br />EDIT: After some serious forum searching, turns out the font is to blame - no PDF readers seem able to scan Helvetica. Dunno why, but there we are.<br /><br />4) Selecting text is iffy, whether by hand/digit or stylus. Sometimes I get the start of the word, other times I'm a letter into the word, with no ability to expand the selection. I don't know if this is a limitation of the device, software, or my motor skills, but it's frustrating regardless. And when I do manage to select, then choose \\"search\\" from the toolbar, it opens up the search field and it's blank. No word at all. Grr.<br /><br />Lots of promise but doesn't quite deliver for me. Lovingthe 2 page read and ability to highlight, underline and annotate. Makes no sesne that the search doesn't work and I'm on the latest version, which has no update. I would uninstall and reinstall except I'm terrified of losing the annotations I've made to my 980 pg document.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The action is fast paced and Mitch Rapp continues to deliver in his usual accurate, daring and no-mercy fashion.  As with all of his books, this one is hard to put down and leaves me eagerly waiting for the next one.
B009JZTP4Y|3.0|The picture quality was fine but the sound sucked. There's no option for subtitles so that was a downer. Although I've seen this movie a few times it would have been nice to be able to make out what they were saying without blasting the tv volume.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I thought this was a lot of fun. The script was really engaging and the child actors were quite good I thought.
B005HSL626|5.0|I LIKE IT AS MUCH AS MY GRANDCHILDREN. KEEPS THEM OCCUPIED AT QUIET TIMES. EASY TO DOWNLOAD. GREAT SITE WHIHC OF COURSE ITS AMAZON ALWAYS EASY TO USE.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Not terribly easy to read with the antiquated language usage, but with the wonderful dictionary included with the Kindle, very interesting.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Quite an entertaining film and I grew up during the original film.  Well chosen cast.  The only thing the movie was really missing was more dancing and a cameo from Kevin Bacon
159420411X|3.0|My review title is a bit facetious, but, really, this book is an extremely rambling discourse on probability, statistics, and its application to forecasting.  One could just as easily start on any topic in the book and proceed randomly, from topic to topic.  There is essentially no building of previous information.<br /><br />I first thought that the outline of the book would follow the trajectory of Silver the man, i.e. from baseball, to online poker to FiveThirtyEight.  But no, we find a series of digressions on Wall Street, investing, and a regurgitation of \\"A Random Walk Down Wall Street\\", and then segue into global warming, with considerable rumination on terrorism for good measure.  But no FiveThirty Eight.  My largest disappointment is that there is no detailed discussion of the FiveThirtyEight methodology, which is, after all, what boosted this book to the top of the charts.<br /><br />Silver is a very bright guy with an entertaining turn of phrase, but, in the end, we are left with a bunch of scatter plots, with both linear and log axes, and little or no explanation about why terrorism statistics (for example) should be log-normal.<br /><br />There is a whole lot more to probability theory than Bayes' Theorem.  How do you separate the signal from the noise?  With a matched filter, obviously.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is better than the 1st Temple Run because there are ziplines & goldmines. A lot more challenges & new locale.
B000BVQ9JO|5.0|First of all, I love the Strokes and recommend all their albums, but this one is their best. Why? Here are 6 reasons: VISION OF DIVISION, ELECTRICITYSCAPE, EVENING SUN, YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, 15 MINUTES, IZE OF THE WORLD...and 7 other cuts are also hella good, with one dud, called Ask Me Anything. This album has truly held up so well since 2006 when it was released. This is because the Strokes are, in my opinion, the best band EVER who produce the most consistently great tracks in each of their 4 albums. You've got band members that work really well together: Albert, Nick & Nikolai play incredible guitars, Fab is fabulous on drums and Jules is one hellova awesome vocalist with an angst-filled falsetto that fits perfect with the melodies, the heavy guitar strumming and the heavy drum beats. If you like R&R and are totally sick of what passes off as good R&R today (i.e. awful bands like Maroon5, One Republic...etc.) just listen to these guys and you'll see what I mean.<br />They are ready to release a new album in March 2013 and I can only hope it's as good as this one.
B009PMB3CI|4.0|From a 10 year old:<br /><br />It's a fun game for people who like puppies & enjoys playing with them virtually.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|Mahjong-ish game that some people would particularly enjoy.  I like it well enough, but I am really a word game person.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Found the movie to be very slow so much so that I fell asleep watching it. I like Tommie Lee Jones but was disappointed in this movie.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|It's impossible to believe this series was cancelled.  I ended up staying up to watch. Each episode led to the next, and I was never sleepy.  I was kind of glad it ended because I'm not sure I could have taken much more, but then again, that is probably because I had been up more than 24 hours.
B009FZFONO|4.0|awesome show<br />720p not quite so awesome<br />this was the so-called hd version, which was only playing in 1280x720 resolution, which feels like a jip because, although it is hd, you can get higher hd elsewhere for the same price.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I ordered Amazon Prime just so I could continue watching this phenomenal series. The actors, the story, and the historical references all combine to make Downton Abbey my new favorite show. I find myself rooting for the different characters and am anxious to watch the third and final season. Bravo, PBS!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Hello my name is Ashton I'm 14<br /> years old and I play this cool / awesome / EPIC game<br />on my kindle fire !!  Some people think that the free one is awesome ... the full version is even better. The only problem is I can't get past the level with lava . So rate this awesome game 4-5 stars . Thank you for reading my first review
0785163174|2.0|Putting aside the fact that more than a quarter f this book is simply filler (two page fight scenes pitting various X-men against various Avengers with purely arbitrary results), the story itself is on par with the Maximum Carnage series from the 1990s. There is a lot of fighting, but you really stop caring pretty early on. The shell of the plot focuses on squeezing characters into antagonistic roles. Basically, without giving away too much it goes like this:<br />Captain America and crew discover that a small nation near America's coast may acquire a weapon of mass destruction (Phoenix). He drops everything and races over to confront the leader of the nation and demand that they turn over an innocent 17-year old year girl without any sort of trial to be held in an undisclosed location for \\"observation.\\" When the leader (Cyclops) balks at the notion, he sets off an international incident. Captain America then calls his army of superheroes in to invade the country (Utopia), and either seize or kill the target. long story short they are expelled, and Cyclops, despite spending the better part of his career being tortured by the Phoenix decides on a whim to actively acquire the power and prove the Avengers right. The Avengers counter by working on bigger weapons that accidentally split the Phoenix into five parts which possesses five Xmen. The Xmen suddenly take over the world and (being possessed by the Phoenix) are obviously in their right minds. lots of fighting. Namor screws up and Scott is blamed, leading to more fighting, more fighting happens, there is a Scarlet Witch ex machina moment, and suddenly it is over... Except that Cyclops is now a war criminal for acting under the influence of an alien being. (Jean Grey was forgiven for that despite destroying whole planets on more than one occasion). Basically the whole book felt like Bendis was merely shoehorning characters into good and bad roles. there was no witty banter, no deep character development, just an excuse to make superheroes fight. In particular Captain America and Cyclops were horribly characterized. The various relationships between the character, built during decades of story arcs are handled with the delicacy of a battleaxe. Some of the art was okay, but on the whole this book was no better than the Fear Itself story arc last year (in many ways it is worse - when the Thing was possessed by an evil alien everyone forgave his destructive rampage no questions asked. When Captain America pushes Cyclops into a similar destructive rampage suddenly the whole world hates him. Sorry Bendis, not buying it)
0756655307|5.0|GIFT FOR MY SON! WHO IS LOCKED UP. HE REALLY ENJOYS IT! HE READS ALL THE TIME.<br />IT WAS A GREAT BUY.
B004X4QVSO|5.0|This I the classic martial arts movie. Predictable, but who cares. Excellent correography, plenty of fight scenes, any a bad guy you love to hate, knowing the physically smaller wing chun master will kick his ass.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Just a super cute movie for the family. Nothing serious, just a light hearted \\"chick flick\\", but even my hubby liked it!
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|After reading the reviews I was concerned about playability.  But I mastered this quickly using the joystick.  Found the phone gyro's to be very sensitive.  But will keep trying since I like the challenge.  Worth trying if plan on getting into RC.  My oldest kid is doing well and may be ready for the real thing soon.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|The Bone Bed - Patricia Cornwell. Don't waste your time. It's convoluted and far fetched. THe ending is a head shaker.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Keeps me up with family and friends..wish the erase button was where I could see it.I am not good at switching from one place to another...say a spot like the like button......I don't want to block a friend just dump a few post sometimes
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This game kept popping up asking you to install it while demoing other games.  If you are not careful, all of the sudden you have this on your device when you didn't expect it.  I quickly removed it.
B0095P31L6|1.0|So I signed up for the Prime trial to get free 2day shipping on a order just to see how the Amazon videos were compared to Netflix. The last order I made from Amazon I did not sign up for Prime and the shipping took a long time and the package was delivered before their web site showed that it had shipped. I almost canceled the order because for more than a week it showed that it had gone nowhere. So when I was looking to buy a new cable modem and wireless router I almost did not buy through Amazon but I decided to give it a try and see if I got better results being a Prime member. This new order was placed on Feb 4th late at night. The order was delivered Feb 5th, which was amazing! Now back to the streaming video story...  I was rather disappointed to say the least with Prime. The first video I tried was Rango there was video but no audio. So I went and tried several other movies with the same results. I then looked at some older movies and tv shows and was able to get some that had audio so I figured it was not a general problem. Another problem with Amazon is that you can not watch the videos on your computer, they are trying to sell you their Kindle Fire. Netflix allows you to watch shows and movies on your PC or a network media player or smartTV. It seems silly to me to restrict the PC playback and I do not think it gets them more Kindle sales. I looked for a place on their website for help but did not find very much help. I also do not understand why some media players support Amazon and others do not. It must have something to do with who pays the media player manufactures to get their product supported. My Sony media player supports Amazon but the NeoTV MAX was not listed and did not have an icon for Amazon. All in all I believe that Amazon has some work to do if they want to compete with Netflix in the streaming area. First impressions are very important and mine was not a good first impression. Maybe they will contact me to see if they can figure out whatthe problems are and if they are on their side or my side. But time is ticking away and I will not stay a Prime member just for the shipping. Maybe Netflix should get try to compete with Amazon in the retail area. Paul
B008B92U32|4.0|I tooled around with this and it is obviously no Photoshop but is good for a quick swap waiting in line or for a laugh at dinner.
B001CDZZI6|1.0|I purchased this book so that I could take an assessment of your strengths. However the ebook does not come with the &#34;packet&#34; that is suppose to be in the back of the book.  Therefore you do not have an access code required.  What good is the ebook to me if I now have to pay again on line to take the assessment?
B00683JK9K|4.0|Excellent puzzle game but hard to do on a small sceen when you select more piecs.  I enjoy it for quick games.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Written in first-person dog, Enzo guides the reader through his life as he tries to understand his humans. Filled with compassion and adventure and insight, Enzo and his way of looking at life will stay with you long after you finish the book. Spoiler alert: tissues will be needed, but only because you fall in love with Enzo.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app has helped me threw math so much this year.<br />it had a negative sign on it when my other calculators did not.<br />I know I should have know that if you just press the subtraction sign after u put in the add, multiply, divide or even the subtraction sign that it would make it a negative but I did not know
B00003CXXS|1.0|this movie  is poor in every way  it is a  rip  off poor story  poor plotting  and a dino saur that is a figment  of  somebodys wild imagine nation and also poor acting  liked the first two  but this one stinks
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is unbelievably well done and mesmerizing.  I can watch every episode over and over!  Appeals to every gender and every age.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|We really enjoyed this show, Walter is our favorite character! It's a little bit different which is nice, try it, we think you'll enjoy it to, if you like shows like along the lines of Warehouse 13, Eureka ect....
B003U4UPHG|5.0|This picks up right where season 1 left off.  Great show, very entertaining.  I have been watching on the weekends when my dvr is empty.

B0044C5SCU|5.0|After the final episode a few weeks ago I thought I would start at the begining. Love every episode! It's Fringe.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|It was an ok movie, but not one my family would sit down to watch again. Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is my wife's favorite book. She read it in about a day. Having it on the kindle makes it easier to read at home or on the go.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I missed it when it came out in the theater, but it was no less outstanding at home with the family.  Even my big strong military hubby laughed his self silly.  Great movie for the whole family.  Caution...now my 6 year old walks around saying,&#34; blah, blah, blah, blah blah&#34;.
B0091WUZJE|5.0|always a winner, never disapoints and is always entertaining , with beautifull scenery and lot of action packed , scenes.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I really did not care for the first movie, but my hubby talked me into watching this one and I really liked it!  Who know the second time was the charm?
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|If you like Fiona Apple you will love this album.  I consider her to be one of the best female music poets around.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|The other movies were good, and I just knew that now the theme would get old, but it turned out to be one of the best ones yet.  Take a watch and you wills see it really is a worth watching movie and if you are already a fan, you will really like it.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This was a good action & fun movie to watch.  Marvel does so good at mixing action & humor together.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that it was not like all the other young vampire to werewolf movies out to day, it was a complete new take and a really worth watching 12 times movie.  Don' miss out on this hidden treasure.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Every Batman has been good, especially this one & The original &#34;The Dark Knight&#34;.  I think they did a good job on creating a extremely &#34;pure evil&#34; villian Bain that Batman has to stop.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't believe I just found this show. The acting and writing are wonderful.  I have enjoyed watching each and every episode!
B005G5PPGS|3.0|It's a decent book.  I like the first half of the book and how they go into the development of looking at other stats.  Later in the book it seemed to drag and become a Billy Bean against the world mentality.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game on kindle fire yet that is why I have rated it 5 stars and hope you enjoy it as much as I do
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I really liked this movie and I walkouts watch it again anytime. I am still quoting lines from this movie and telling others about it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Unfortunately I never heard of this book until the movie was released. I fell in love with this movie and I just had to read the book once I saw it, and it was the best choice, I couldn't set it down. This book brought me to tears, I found myself silently laughing to myself. I definitely give this book an A+!!!!It's time to start the next one. :)
B007HJ9NBE|4.0|The music was good.  Julianne was a great &#34;preacher's daughter.&#34;  The school bus race did it's job to redneck the whole movie.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book puts a reader right back into the times of when the Jews were being rounded up and sent off to their 'death'.  Very emotional in a way that allows one to experience what it would've felt like if you were one of the Jews during that time.<br /><br />Must read if you don't know much about the Holocaust and want to know more.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Once you start reading this story, it's hard to put down. I can't wait to see the movie version (and there will surely be a movie version). I don't know why, but I somehow picture Matthew McConaughnay (?) as the lead.
B003LXSY60|5.0|this is a pretty bad ass album i would recommend you throw down some money for this well made album
B0095P3ULC|2.0|It only took me about 15 minutes.  These Transformers movies keep getting more expensive and equally more ridiculous.  The first one was charming and really funny, especially the first half.  The humor reminded me of Armageddon.  I actually liked Shia LaBeouf back then.  This one tries way too hard in every aspect and fails in almost all of them.  I understand these movies are not to be taken too seriously (I mean this is one step up from Power Rangers), but this movie could've been presented much better.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the special effects and action sequences were exciting at times.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|this is a pretty bad ass album i would recommend you throw down some money for this well made album
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Very good movie and great acting.  Very good to be able to watch a family movie and not having to worry about censorship.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read! Couldn't put it down! Immediately went out and got the other 2 books in the series. I was very sad when I finished reading them all.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Loved this series. I missed seeing it on T.V. but heard people talk about it so started watching it &#34;On Demand&#34;. Watched every episode of the first two series and can't wait for the third season to start.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Excellent movie. It follows the book pretty well, and doesn't change key plot lines in the story. My only complaint is that the cinematography is too shaky at times- hopefully they fix that for the next one.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|It came with my Josh Groban CD  I put them both on right away<br />I love both of these performers
B004UPANAI|1.0|I rented this and it won't let me play it.  It also will not let me refund it.  Apparently there are no human beings that work for amazon, but if there are, could one please contact me so i can get my refund
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I was thinking this would come on Feb.5  the  release date but it didnt. The 2 CD package I bought from his concert on HSN did arrive on Feb 5th the release date.<br />This arrived  Feb8th instead
B00820N2JG|5.0|Who doesn't love social and political commentary from puppets? If you are a fan of Southpark then you'll be a fan of this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was an interesting and intriguing book.  It took some turns you never expected and was very detailed.  I liked it
B000FCK9D6|5.0|This is one of my favorite Agatha Christie books.  It is a lot of fun to read.  I plan to read it several times!
B007THA4FI|5.0|After reading the reviews with people whining about this not being like Harry Potter...it's not supposed to be! It's an adult book with adult content and I for one, was very impressed. Ms. Rowling knows human beings. I'd say it's one of the best mirrors of human nature I've ever read. I love Harry Potter, truly, but I went into this book knowing there would be no wizards or love conquers all fairy tales. It's gritty, it's real, and maybe some people can't handle coming face to face with the things they don't like about themselves that are represented in her characters. She pulls no punches in showing the dirty underbelly of polite society. It's honest, something lacking in most modern authors and I commend her, for not just that but for showing the world she's got the range to be more than the children's author so many have pigeonholed her to be.<br /><br />Read the book for itself, not just because of who wrote it, dismiss any preconceived notions you might have about what Rowling *should* write, and enjoy. And if you find yourself disturbed or put off by what you read, even better.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I must admit that I had to find out what all the fuss was about and I bought it. The story kept me interested until I got to the point where the woman was going to move in with this man. I did not care for her wording so much either.
B0081336FO|5.0|Very entertaining and perhaps better than season one. The producers have succeeded in translating this classic character to the 21st century while retaining his essential &#34;Britishness&#34; . The only problem I have is that they made so few episodes.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|One  of Baldacci's best.  The characters draw you in from the beginning. And the story is not predictable. Once you get into it you can't put it down.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Nice little game for the price.  Not too difficult but hints are included if you need them.<br />I forgot to write down the date I started from but needn't have worried.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|While not a &#34;classic&#34;, is is the best thing to show up on PBS for a few years now.  It is through and through a &#34;soap&#34;, albeit with the Bitiish &#34;upper classes&#34; and those who serve them..
B003SHUMRI|4.0|I absolutely love Channing Tatum and his great dancing in this movie!!!  I glad it's a 2-day rental so I can watch it over and over.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The DVD came quickly and was fantastic!  I would recommend this to anyone who likes the series and may purchase season 3 as well.
B00821OX98|5.0|Me and my wife loved the show. If you like The Walking Dead. You're absolutely going to love it too.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best game ever I love it. You have to get this game right now not later now right now now now now
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK.  IT WAS WELL WRITTEN, MAYBE A LITTLE TOO SWEET IN CERTAIN PLACES, BUT THE SUBJECT AND THE END ARE REMARKABLE AND TREATED WITH TACT AND KINDNESS.<br />IT IS OBVIOUSLY A WOMEN'S BOOK... TOO BAD FOR THE OTHER GENDER!
B0087HT36U|4.0|great game.Loads of fun. Just wish I could get the updates easier. Not being able to get updates is very frustrating.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Wow both my kids 4 and 8 loved this movie.  I did read some negative reviews before buying this and was a little scared by them.  My daughter can get scared easily and is sensitive.  I watched the movie with my kids.  Are there some scary parts, yes, is it anything more than any other Disney movie, NO.<br />Brave is a very cute movie with a different plot than most Disney Princess movies.  I like that it is not a love story.<br />It does have some nudity (if you can even call it that) Her little brothers it shows their behinds, and the mother says she is naked but they don't show anything.  I was a bit surprised when I saw the scenes, but it did not adversely affect the movie in my opinion.<br />A great movie for all ages!!
B0088T3B0G|4.0|Great acting - fast paced complicated script - easy to follow but you are still left with a suprise at the end. In all a great movie and one I'd watch again.
B000N6TYLW|1.0|As an avid Gilmore girls fan I was in love with this series.  I watched every season, bought every DVD box set, I felt like I grew up with Rory and Loralie.<br />The seventh season is a huge disappointment to a wonderful show.  The main creator and writer of the show left after the 6th season.  Season 7 the last season in the series was written by someone else and it never worked.  It was not the same funny drama we had all been used to.  They tried to duplicate the banter but failed miserably.  The characters seemed like different people. (Especially Luke) The last episode gave us what was needed but it was all too late.  A sad end to a show I loved!  only watch or buy if you have not seen any other seasons or you will be disappointed.
B004QX07G4|2.0|The first third of this book was really funny, even made me laugh out loud several times, but then it became hard to even read. I love Ellen, but I couldn't keep up with the jumping from topic to topic, and the random ramblings. I got bored and annoyed after a certain point and hurried through the last portion of the book. I would honestly not recommend this book. Sorry Ellen, I had really high hopes.
B00821OX98|5.0|The Walking Dead with aliens. This show has such good characters. Tom and company make you care about them and forget the aliens are even around.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I like this speedlight. It is easy to use, and works really well. The photo light turns out beautiful, with the right exposure. Swivels 180 degrees, and tilts. Very important for taking pics sideways as well as up and down. I highly recommend it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It's too bad that our school history books are not as thorough in showing how great people are not born that way, they become great through trial and error, through suffering, loss and often luck.  This is a lengthy book, but every page is rich in describing a time and a man, who while an American hero, also had his human flaws, insecurities and some of the biases of his time.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great book,easy read,at one point during reading you will have no clue where the story is going. Exciting! Good story
B000RH0C8G|4.0|Though I'm not a baseball fanatic, I found this book really interesting from a business management point of view.  It makes you think that there is probably a science for everything.  I came in knowing little about the characters themselves, who were not as confident as I anticipated, and I even felt bad for some of the major league players.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Very good read, I enjoyed it very much. Looking froward to reading more of Lee Child. Could not put it down.
B0095P29EG|5.0|This movie was awesome. Saw it in the theaters when it first came out and would definitely recommend it to anyone that has not seen it yet!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this was a great coming of age story, the main character reveals how childhood traumas can manifest. I'm glad he overcame his.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great production and a great story. Is really a masterpiece. Love to see more of it.<br />Hope to see season 3 soon.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Books are dark, light or a mix...this particular book is dark. There are a few light spots here, but not many. I began to feel as depressed as main character, Libby, but read on as I did get caught up in the mystery and wanted to know \\"who dunnit.\\"
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Just a few episodes in and I am hooked. Characters are very likeable. Can't wait to see how the show progresses in the season.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved every mythology Rick Riordan Riordan made so far but this this this was the best .ends leaving u guessing what will happen next
B005PK56TA|2.0|The first few episodes were really interesing. With the the third or fourth, the show moved into mediocre, and by the eighth it was just too stupid to continue.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun.I love to buy the characters in the game.My favorite part is to go on the tours.You should keep thinking of new tours to do.So I give this game five stars as a rate.:)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Entertaining and easy to use works great on my Android phone.  I have had no problems with this phone whatsoever.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|It sucks so much it's stupid lame my little 2 year old hates it don't get it people say it's cool but it's not there stupid people so it sucks
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book, cannot wait to see the movie. Hopefully, the movie is as good as the book. I could not put this book down. It was a good read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game, really enjoyable.you should definitely get it.and its free.I love this game and is much better than the first one.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|still trying to learn how to use it. and is a little but hard to use  but trying to learn it
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Received this book as a gift. Once I started it I couldn't wait to pick it up every spare moment. The way Follet weaves the different story lines meant I never tired of the story. I enjoyed learning about a time in history that I did not know much about. I bought the sequel immediately after finishing the last page!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This app is great for horse lovers. It is fun, but I wish it was a little more challenging,and that you could do more with the horse.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Counter intutive, but being challanged is productive and  Harris' presentation makes you think about the theory. Thinking is good. Enjoy and share
B007V4530A|5.0|I loved this book, its an evil genius cookbook to delivering the best presentation in the world.  if your in business and need to sell an idea this should be in your library!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This one didn't have the same intensity of the other two, but as it got towards the end, was very exciting, and came to a conclusion that was mostly expected, but with a satisfying twist at the end.
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I have liked this movie for years.  I really like the setting and the costumes.  filmed with all the seasons of the year
B003O86FMW|5.0|I picked up The Hunger Games on sale and was surprised that I couldn't put it down.  I gobbled up the whole series in a matter of days.  I'm in my 50's, so I thought I wouldn't get behind a young adult novel, but I found the broader themes of repression and inequality well drawn and interesting.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|I saw this movie when I got my amazon prime trial due to liking both actors (Natalie Portman & Ashton Kutcher)<br />I personally wouldn't watch it again, not being into chic flicks female friends of mine however really liked it
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I did not watch this series when it was first broadcast and am sorry that I missed it.  I can think of few shows with so many twists in one season.  The extreme nature of some of the events did require a bit of suspension of disbelief, but it is still great science fiction.  It definitly makes you think about what might be possible and what goverments and other entities might try to do with scientific advances.  There is also plenty of comic relief. Watching it in streaming HD was also great although streaming sometimes bogged down and caused playback to revert to SD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This read was so amazing. The story was deeper than expected but that only made it better. To me this was more than a book; it was a journey. I loved how everything connected. This was a truely amazing book. Dispite the \\"chapter titles\\" and the fact that it was a little confusing in the beginning. This is a must read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!  Lots of twists and turns.  It starts out a little ordinary, but stick with it!!  It's very interesting!
0061537969|5.0|I have not read a book in a long long long time as I usually have a hard time staying interested in a story.  This book was given to me a few years ago and I finally got around to reading it.  I loved it so much! Being from Seattle area, I could relate to the environment, I fell in love with Enzo and his family and loved this book to the last word.  I highly recommend it!
B0095P31L6|5.0|Best movie of the year. Story and artwork couldn't be better. Seen it 5 times and still enjoy as much as the first.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It wasnt very long but it was a good story. Very similar to the fifty shades of grey series which I loved. :) I would recommend this book to others.
B00A8LRIEW|4.0|The earlier milestone albums by New Order - Movement, Power, Corruption & Lies, plus Low Life were all 8 song albums, so is Lost Sirens. In fact it is longer time wise than 2 of the three albums I just mentioned. It sounds more like an album due to a cohesion that is ghost like on WFTSC. It has a better collection of original material with Hellbent as the Regret like big single. From the 1st chord you know you are listening to typical, iconic N O single material that is as good as it gets. Overall this album sounds like bits and pieces of Technique, Republic, and the last Electronic release - Twisted Tenderness to me. With these comments I'm sure to stir lots of angst and dismayed original listeners back to when it all started like me (for example).<br /><br />For those whom want me to hate this I can't. I must have over 100 releases when you consider Joy Division, New Order, The Other Two, Revenge, Monaco, Sub Sub, Electronic, Bad Lieutenant, Hot Chip, Blank & Jones, etc. plus all the other stuff they guested on the Factory label. My ear for tone and listening came of age at the same time I went out every night of the decade called the 1980's. Their sound, that sound ruled as three distinct creative musical statements from 1978 as punk, then onto more new wave as N O matured, and finally acid house as the latter part of that turned into the 24 hour party people. I once gave a close friend a two hour mix tape of nothing but cuts of Blue Monday - original and remixed versions sanctioned by the band for an Xmas present (and some mixes were even left off).<br /><br />How can I ever have anything but high regard and consideration for anything any of them do/did? I think if Gillian had been aboard this album or sessions this material from the start, adding a woman's touch, we'd all be aglow with 5 stars and \\"oh my god\\" have you heard this. Now being 50 plus rather 30 something does spin things a tad different. No matter I still feel young when I hear this and now that I received an actual import CD it has all the traditional tracings, cutting edge album art by Peter Saville plus it is published as a 2013 release.<br /><br />This fact alone would signals a demarcation from the WFTSC album in substance and intent. To those whom differ I say Leave Us Alone and those whom are irate why don't you go piss off as suggested by Your Silent Face. New Order are still quite capable of being a great band in any combination. I do not require, nor demand a reunion of the original 4. Somethings in this life journey are ever changing. Hopefully the efforts of those willing to strive will satiate the creative artist discretion with a higher standard of expression, no matter the time and place. Rock on. This music matters I am happy to say and glad it's seeing the light of whatever year.<br /><br />My Own Private Sirens album (given the chance to combine the two this is what I like)<br /><br />1) I'll Stay With You  (Lost Sirens)<br />2) Sugarcane  (Lost Sirens)<br />3) Recoil  (Lost Sirens)<br />4) Waiting For The Siren's Call (Waiting For The Sirens' Call)<br />5) Californian Grass  (Lost Sirens)<br />6) Krafty  (Waiting For The Sirens' Call)<br />7) Hellbent  (Lost Sirens)<br />8) Morning Night And Day  (Waiting For The Sirens' Call)<br />9) I've Got A Feeling  (Lost Sirens)<br />10) I Told You So  (Lost Sirens)<br />11) Jetstream  (Waiting For The Sirens' Call)<br />12) Guilt Is A Useless Emotion  (Waiting For The Sirens' Call)<br />13) Turn  (Waiting For The Sirens' Call)received an actual import CD it has all the traditional tracings, cutting edge album art by Peter Saville plus it is published as a 2013 release.<br /><br />This fact alone would signals a demarcation from the WFTSC album in substance and intent.

B008476HBM|5.0|P and P is one of my favorite stories and the first novel I reread on my new Kindle paperwhite.  I loved them both
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I love ted talks and this app makes it so accessible to view them. The quality of video is perfect on my kindle.
B007L96SI6|3.0|I thought this would be awesome - just like her songs on American Idol.  However, they all sounded the same.  She sings beautifully but she has to change up her beats and styles.  :(
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Awesome game.  this is one of the most fun games I have ever played for Android.  Lep's World 1 is fun, but Lep's World 2 is way more fun.  If you download this game, you won't be sorry.  I don't play dumb games, trust me, you'll love it.
B009NPA3MS|3.0|Too bad he didn't change up his styles like we all know he can.  The entire cd sounded like a folk rock cd and nothing else.  C'mon Philip.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very well thought out. Good messages for everyone in an enjoyable way. Thorougly, enjoyed by all of our family. Thanks.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I  have been reading Agent Pendergast stories since I read the first book in the series &#34;Cabinet of Curiousities&#34; and am always excited when I see a new book out by these two fantastic writers/collaborators.  The writing is good, the storyline is engrossing and I hate it when I come to the end and realize I have to wait FOREVER for the next book in the series.
0062200909|5.0|From the embossed cover and heavy glossy paper through the beautiful illustrations, line art and photos of the creative process, this book is a wonderful inside look at the sheer amount of design work that went into &#34;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.&#34;. I particularly enjoyed the evolution of hair and makeup, but was astonished at the detail on everything the characters carried.<br /><br />If an inside look at how the film came together interests you, this is the one to get.  I am looking forward to the next one in the series.
1582701709|3.0|I read The Secret two times. Once a few years ago and again this year. I should say it is a great book in the sense that it has many inspiring stories, quotes and it is encouraging people to be very positive. Which is true, as if we are constantly having negative thoughts we cannot expect our life to work well. But what I did find strange is that the writer does not emphasize enough that changing your mind is not enough. You actually have to act. And if you want more money hanging a 10.0000 £ (fake) note above your bed and look at it every day is just not enough. You have to act on it and than you can expect more money. So like most of the motivational books, this one has it's own value but do not expect that after reading this book your life will suddenly change. You have to do something for it and than your positive thinking and your actions together will create the life you actually dream of.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I've had the game for a couple of weeks and can't enjoy it because of the glitches.  It's not very responsive to your commands and often there are quite a few slight pauses during game play.  For a game that is based on speed and fast reflexes all the delays and glitches make it unplayable.
B00009L1OB|5.0|Duran2's Seven and The Ragged Tiger remains one of the greatest albums of all time. From the remarkable and magical New Moon on Monday piece to the stunning and beautifully eerie Tiger Tiger instrumental, this CD is timeless and enduring. A perfect CD to have with Duran's Rio. When I had the joy of attending Duran2's 1984 Seven and The Ragged Tour, I will always remember Tiger Tiger playing as a Tiger's face appeared on their giant video screen. The screams and cheers for the band was incredle! The energy of the band and audience was a constant barrage of fireworks and electricity. Waves of power! Pure magic! This CD gives you a prelude to what the 1984 tour was like. Get Arena and the Sing Blue Silver and Arena DVDs too. Insanely magnificent! I love Duran Duran! Vivian McAlexander
B0095P3ULC|5.0|Very nice and the picture is in excellent sound.can not beat it. Fun to watch on the kindle fire hd
B001NLKT60|4.0|Very well written a book with great characters, very hard to put down! It kept me guessing the whole time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this product is both visually and in words lets you know<br />what life is in the battery and how you can use it wisely.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Coming from a wife and mother,this was a very moving and touching book about what's important in life.......LOVED IT!! Can't wait for the movie!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am obsessed with this game. So good. A great source of entertainment for the kids or simply yourself!!!!! A must have item
1936608898|5.0|This book is solid. I learned so much and the evidence and how it's written is well-balanced. It's not at all trying to convince anyone to do anything, it gives you detailed explanation on food and body. It's really good, I highly recommend this is EVERYONE. I recently gave it as a gift to my mom who has very poor diet so she's reading it that. This knowledge certainly helped me and Paleo has changed my life to being amazing!
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is exactly what my husband wanted for Christmas. All the DVDs were there, the product was in fine shape, and all has worked well.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Unique original music!!  You don't find a lot of that these days!  Several different genres rolled into one awesome sound.
1400031362|2.0|After the first two outstanding books in this series, to say this third one disappointed me would be an understatement. Most of the aspects that were charming from previous installments are missing or barely present here. For example, Rra. Matekoni is suffering from depression and as a result his participation in the story is minimal, not to mention the ridiculous way in which this situation is handled in the story. The two kids that were staying with Mma. Ramotswe were a central piece of interest for me, and I assume most readers, but in this book they are relegated to a minor spot in the plot. Even with that, the composition the girl shares with her new family is the high point in this book. It is a shame the author did not make better use of this character.<br /><br />Add on top of that a couple of cases with very little appeal, and you end up with a story that dragged along at sloth's speed. Even Mma Ramotswe thought the main case was ridiculous as you can see in the title of this review, and that was only a hint of the things to come. Maybe the only other redeeming quality of this book is that we get to learn a little more about Mma. Makutsi, and she sure is a sharp one, but I did not find this to be enough to make the overall book's quality good.<br /><br />I just hope that this was a stumble in the way and that in the next book we will find the quality of the first two installments. Therefore, I will read [[ASIN:140003180X The Kalahari Typing School for Men (No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, Book 4)]] in the near future to determine if this is a series worth pursuing farther. Of course, if you have not read other books in the series, my recommendation is not to start here and go back to the first two books, since those are truly worth it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i really love what they did with this one the first one was okay but this one takes it to a new level
B0062IQNG4|4.0|I really like this album, nearly as much as I like the movie. Great variety and fun to listen to no matter what you're doing.

B0015KGWZG|5.0|Dyer's approach is not complex but has led to multiple breakthroughs for me. Highly recommended for those interesting in self reflection, self improvement, and happiness.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I believe Fringe is one of the best programs there are.  Could this possibly happen in the present day?  Quite a bit of Fringe is fiction, for now, but how much of it really happens today is unknown.  I really love how events are explained.  I do think, it is a program that builds on itself.  If you don't watch it regularly, you will not be familiar with what is going on in the show.  Totally love it as my husband and I are watching all seasons.  This is one a sci-fi show/program, not to miss.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I decided to start watching this because I had heard wonderful things about it and they were right.  Worth the watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun game.  creative,  interactive and visually beautiful. one of my new faves.  sometimes it doesn't load properly but has never crashed while playing.
0439023491|5.0|Loved the first book in this trilogy.  Loved the second book and now I can't wait to read the third!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed th the first two, but felt unsatisfied with the final installment.<br />I didn't like the conclusion, i thought it was a bit forced,as though the author was rushing to tie up so many loose ends.
B0049U4INC|4.0|I like the short stories  that Guy is presenting in this book. Very simple to understand and put it in practice.<br />Highly recommended.
1419702238|5.0|I personally haven't read these books, but my kids love them.  They anxiously anticipate each new book.  It's nice to see them reading and laughing.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|I like this theme of humans over coming their hate of other people and especially when it is based on real events.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|My kids enjoy watching this movie over and over.  Very cute movie. It's so much fun watching the Smurfs come to life from the animations.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|While I didn't feel the book was &#34;literature, the subject matter was interesting and I  enjoyed reading it and can recommend it to others.
B009CPES4I|5.0|Me and my mom just loved watching this movie unfold.  Its a real great story that shows you how we all live in our Western bubble pretty much unaware of what it is like to live in other parts of the world.
B003JYMF8Y|2.0|Same o'l, same o'l. I was hoping for better from George Romero. I like Zombie movies; but story, characters and special effects are all second rate.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great show. Very suspenseful. But you would definitely want to watch the first two seasons. It really stretches the limits of your imagination.
B007C3TVNA|1.0|Not since \\"Funny Games\\" have a seen a film so devoid of meaning.  Perhaps, like earthquakes, these things must come along at regular intervals.  Like an itch you can't scratch, Kevin is out of reach of the viewer - and the throttling he deserves cannot be delivered.  Perhaps this is why the film appeals to some - a celebration of impotence or some other Freudian concept.  As for me, the one positive in it was that I saw it for free.  Of course, like \\"Funny Games\\", after it was over, I felt the filmmaker owed me for my time.  Whatever else you can say about the film, it makes porn seem absolutely artistic by comparison.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a good continuation of a good story. I read book 1 on a flight and book 2 during a blizzard. Will find another captive situation to read the final book of the series.
0765325950|5.0|The last book in the series, Sanderson did Jordan very proud in his completion of the wheel of time. I will not offer any spoilers but I had a real good time reading this book.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show is so awesome. a cross between star wars and indiana jones. I so hope that the rumors this shows being revived pan out. I can't believe it was cancelled. Go figure.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|If you loved the x-file, you'll enjoy fringe.<br />Story line and effects are really good.<br />Actors performance could be better.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I like the book but not the style  I enjoyed the book from the perspective of death but not the move back and forth in time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Usually the third book in a trilogy becomes to predictable but Suzanne Collins has put unexpected twists to keep you  going. For best enjoyment be sure to read the Hunger Games Trilogy in the correct order.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This book is original, clever, surprising, and absurd. Quick character development still results in interesting characters you either love or hate. A delight - I used it to keep me in bed during a bout of pneumonia.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|The acting and story line was entertaining - good twist at the end. Information about how a sniper lines up for the target was superior.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|excelente movie, el delivery a su tiempo , y el producto buenissimo,<br />recomeindo a todos que compren sin problema, lo uso en mi sala, en mi pc, en mi laptop, en la ipad, etc....
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really enjoy the quirkiness of the characters. Lots of surprising twists. Especially fun for those interested New Age ideas, but on an entertainment level. Conspiracy theorists------ENJOY!
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great new sci-fi show!  My family didn't want to watch it at all but I just knew it was going to be great.  Now they are all addicted to it.  We can't get enough of it! Season 1 is awesome.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i have it on the xbox. the ipod mincraft is ok. it is one of the best game i ever had. if you like mincraft and you have the free mincraft you should got this.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Except for Clint's (no) sacrifice at the end (oops - spoiler alert too late), this is a kind of upside down moral tale of a Ford Motor worker in the role of Mr. Miyagi and the kids are the Hmong immigrants, pimped by the 70s US war machine, abandoned on the mean streets of where, Detroit?<br />Worth it for all the anti-Asian epithets alone, and the hints of Fast and Furious rice-burners v Motown Muscle!
B008133MDK|5.0|Season two was even better than season 1 and they did a wonderful job taking some of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's most acclaimed stories.  I really enjoyed this show's adaptation of the Hound of the Baskerville in particular.  A thrilling and often funny season!
B001FVV2X2|4.0|The show is very similar to the x-files and while the leads are great, Mulder and Scully had much better chemistry...that said the show has excellent story lines. I am only on the eighth episode so I only hope it gets better
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock is a truly brilliant and fun show.  I enjoyed how intelligent the writing was and the duo of Cumberbatch and Freeman is too good to pass up.  A must see for mystery lovers!
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Great product. I would buy this product again or suggest it to a friend whom I thought might be interested
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I hated to see the series end because they gave me so much pleasure, even after multiple readings. Perhaps the author could see her way to a spin-off either of series or characters. I'd buy them in a minute.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is almost exactly like the first Mario game for the NEW. And that is not a bad thing. Tight controls, great gameplay make this a must have game for the kindle fire!
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I enjoy going outside and looking at the stars. You can see the horiscopes. It is very enjoyable and fun.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Ive probably watched this over a dozen times. I never realized just how talented Christina is. Definitely a must see.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have tried several types of solitaire games and this one is easy fast and takes no time in setting it up.
B008B92U32|3.0|This is alright. Not the best app for this type of manipulation of photos but OK. I would tell people to try it for themselves and evaluate on their own terms.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Enjoyed the videos and the acting was excellent especially in Touching Evil and Prime Suspect,<br />being there was not really my cup of tea, although I a sure the acting was good.
B007N0REX6|4.0|Bought this for our Step Granddaughter's boyfriend at Christmas 2012 that is a lead guitarist and can jam pretty good. We though he'd like to have a little SLASH around.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series! Great humor, storyline and setting. I'm obsessed, just bought season 3:) Once you star watching you won't be able to stop. The Amazon streaming version was good quality and I had no real issues. A couple of times I had to reload the page, but I think that had more to do with my Internet connection than anything else:)
B009B0L324|5.0|How else can you rate an AC/DC recording?! You can't!! Been listening to AC/DC since the 1970's and love to jack it up when I'm riding my Harley-Davidson Ultra Glide.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Very few details except when he was saving other people.  He got two guys here, three guys there, another four or five somewhere else.  I understand that he was a really great guy in helping others -- but he wasn't a very good book writer.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is the best dictionary app I have found yet. It's great to be able to use off line as I have a problem with spelling and word finding since an accident I had in 2003. I use it on a HTC Sensation 4G running Ice Cream Sandwich update.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Highly entertaining. Easy to use. Helpful hints. Good app to have on hand if you like the game of solitude.great bargain.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It kept me wanting to come back to see what was going to happen next.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|fun show, good story line. It is fun to watch for a sci fi show., nothing too hard to enjoy.
B007WPM4P0|5.0|I love all the stories PBS shares.  Well done.  I enjoy story settings of WWi & WWII. This has inspired me to read Sebastian Faulks books.  This story has you experiencing the whole spectrum of emotion, love it!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|This is a very fun game and quite addictive. It's almost too easy to pass, or waste time playing it.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|My husband really liked it, but my opinion is that it is just Okay.  I felt that there was too much medical jargon that I really did not like or understand.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Thought this would be more of a comedy. A little to sad for me. Even though the mood picks up it just wasn't my cup of tea.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Easy read but very entertaining and always wanting to know what happens next. I could not put this book down!! :)
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Definitely recommend this movie. Loved the Characters and the idea of doing something bold even in our later years. Delightful!
B00005JOA0|5.0|I read this book years ago when I was in a Bronte sisters mode.  It was fun to get a DVD.  Fun to see the story put into motion after reading the book.
B000NMW6M0|4.0|This movie was great. In the beginning it was hard to follow, but it came together in the end. All of the intertwining stories were interesting, except for how it ended.
1433502410|5.0|This is a great Bible.  It has so many extra features.  I am really enjoying using it.  It comes with a download of the Bible on the internet that has proved to be invaluable.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|The translation from French must have been an enormous task. Unfortunately there are some bad translating choices (e.g. you for the formal &#34;vous&#34; and thou for the familiar &#34;tu&#34;).  Other than that, congratulations to the translators!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This show will keep you glued to your seats as you see how Henry VIII changes England!  It's a must see.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. Every time I thought I got it figured out ...another twist came along. Couldn't put the book down
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This is a great television series that gives you an insight into the lives of King Henry VIII, and the English court.  The characters are really interesting, the plot lines are rich, and will keep you enthralled.  I also think this series provides a good historical account of Henry VIII's decisions that shaped England.  We all know basically what happened.  This series will provide you with details!
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Once I started watching I couldn't stop. Episode after episode. I was carrying my iPad around the house so I could get things done.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|this show focuses on a time period that interests me. the whole dynamic between the wealthy in england and their hired help is fascinating plus you add the great storylines, well it makes for a great show!
0767830555|5.0|this is a great movie one that is similar is &#34;Falling Down&#34;. I wont be selling it, classic De Niro
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Really like this one, especially the ability to toss and turn the cube-interesting and entertaining.  Good, colorful and can be more challenging than one would think.  Fun!!
B004FK24ZA|5.0|I wanted to buy the movie for a foreign exchange student who had mentioned the movie. We both were surprised the other was so familiar with it. It is a great movie. The bonus was she should be able to take it home and play it on her dvd player because it is all-region.  For both of us this is one of our favorite Cary Grant movies. Across generations, i'm 52 she's 16.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I loved how it is narrated by three different characters that all have their own powers.<br />It is the second book in the Heroes of Olympus series which is a sequel series to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I bought  this because I liked their free version and now only use their free version because it is easier and better to use than their pay version .
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian is a master of setting the stage and then revealing the clues one at a time leaving the reader asking WTF is going on?  She develops great, flawed and very human characters...and twisted.  Don't forget twisted.  Loved the story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I found the beginning a little teenage angst ridden and thought what have I got myself here.... but the this book slow but surely creeps into your heart , by the end I couldn't get enough<br />I loved how well written the characters were and the story line was brilliant!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts out easy and gets harder on each level.  Very fun and addicting to play.  Give it a try and I think you will like it.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|1 thing is it has long to load I been waiting for a long time it has 460mb to go
B009RI4FRU|4.0|MOONRISE KINGDOM is a totally different sort of film, the sort I don't want to over-analyze. I can, however, say the following: Although a bit slow-moving, it's highly imaginative and has a quietly slapstick, satirical humor that's just all its own. Kara Hayward (as Suzy Bishop) and Jared Gilman (as \\"Sam\\") are very natural in their roles as two outcast 12-year-olds who find a bond and just want to be alone together, but alas, the world won't let them be. Excellent scenery on \\"New Penzance,\\" a fictitious New England island without roads that seems to symbolize childhood itself or something like that.<br /><br />It's one of those films that makes a point of saying \\"Childhood's real--adulthood's fake.\\" All the same, much of the adult cast, especially Bill Murray as Suzy's crackpot father and Frances McDormand as her tyranncial mother, plays its part very well. MOONRISE KINGDOM also has a great deal of embedded satire regarding bureaucracy in education, paramilitarism in the \\"Khaki Scouts,\\" dysfunction in the American family, and many other things.<br /><br />Enjoyed it!
B000FA675C|5.0|Fascinating story line, and plausible. I had read it before, and read it again. Still a good read. Could be possible, and would not be encouraged by the church.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|I ended up buying this set about 2/3 of the way through the PBS run of Season 3. The fact that they are marked &#34;Original UK Edition&#34; led me to believe that these were more definitive editions than those being broadcast in the US right now, with additional footage. Nothing could be further from the truth! These have whole swaths of dialogue and even entire scenes missing as compared to the PBS episodes, often making the story less clear or reducing the impact of scenes that were set up earlier, in scenes that are now missing. These actually watch like a dumbed-down version of the Downton we know and love. I was extremely disappointed and I cannot recommend these discs to anyone unless they have no other option for watching the series. It also makes me very wary of purchasing anything from PBS's DVD label in the future, if I cannot trust them to present their shows in an unedited format.
0425252868|5.0|Demonstrates the honor code of aviators going back to WWI. Interesting that the pilots in Germany were not generally political, but flew for love of flying. The story has been told before, but not this thouroughly, and not to its conclusion, with their meeting after many years. A higher calling, indeed.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This is such a dark rendition of life. The characters are hatable but then likable all in the same scene. The story just keeps greating darker and darker and then there is always a twist around the corner. Jax and Tara's struggle to just make their lives work is so great and how Juice is struggling with his history. Each character is struggling in their own way yet you root for each so differently.  There are so many different elements that keep you glued to the screen. Keep this show alive!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is my favorite series on TV right now. Love the beautiful furnishings and especially the women's dresses. I hope  it stays on for a while!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading this.  I might have changed the ending but it was a different view of a possible world of the future.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|If you love slender you'll love this,trust me its scary and fun. While you're playing this dont look behind HE'S WATCHING! After i bet you'll be shaking right off you're chair. He sees you in your sleep!!!!!!!!! So dont go to bed focus your eyes on the game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to read this before I saw the movie.  What I found is that it is always better to read the book.  The movie was good but the book was so much better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it because it's the best ever I,love the,way that you can get carts and gems I enjoy my time playing with it.please  get this game.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Not what I was expecting and thats good. About a haunted house and the people living and dead who reside there. Doesn't descend into the witless world of tired teenage shocks and predictable plot twists. Overall, horror, suspense and story for adults.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Scary manipulation not normal... wish there wad a second book please finish what  you started. What will their child turn out like
1451695195|5.0|This book was very interesting because of the background and education of the author.  He makes the case for the afterlife convincingly through science which is &#34;novel&#34;.................
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are well worth a 5 star rating. These book are full of, unexpected love, first times, kinkyness, drama, action [many kinds of action ;)] , and most of all family. E L James made these books worthy for most to read. It definitely gets you thinking and talking. I originally got the first book for my husband to read, he got too busy to read it, so I picked it up and fell in love on the first 5 pages. These books would be great for the people wanting to explore in sex, and for those whom like kinky sex mixed with unconditional love. Good job Ms. James! 2 Thumbs up
0553296981|5.0|This is really a fabulous book.  Please don't read it if you don't like sad endings. If you aren't grief stricken and suicidal at the end you are a sociopath and probably a nazi.
B00683JK9K|5.0|Really relaxing and fun to do!  Love the pictures! Going to tell my friends about these puzzles too!  Thank you!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Knowing that there are lots of people out there that have very strong views, good and bad,  about this book and the following books, I find this to be a hard thing to do. My sister-in-law talked me into reading it and I did.  Although the subject matter was difficult for me to swallow and I had real questions for the heroine. because if I had been in her shoes I would have been running for the hills.  I don't care how good looking the guy is or how rich, loving him would not allow me to subject myself to such an intense degree.  Sorry, I am too strong willed and too independent to be someone's whipping boy. But, even though I felt that way about both the hero and heroine, I found the story intriguing enough to finish the book.  So, your choice will be based on how you view yourself and your world.  Good luck with that!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and great for on the go traveling.Great for all ages!This game is like Temple Run but more....for the younger kids too not just for the older kids.
B009GEDP26|5.0|I'm kind of sad that I actually caught up with the series already.. after watching all the episodes, From season 1 to 5..<br />I wanna keep watching everytime I come home...<br /><br />I can't wait for the next episode.. And please... More Please...<br />yeah... speechless cause I can't wait for the next episode..hehe..<br /><br />Thanks for making me smile everyday since I started watching the whole series..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game. I like it. It is fun to dodge train coming to you. It you don't have this game you should get it.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|this movie was a huge disappointment. don't believe the good reviews. what a downer, hollywood mumbo-jumbo liberal leaning disappointment of a nights entertainment. two thumbs down.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have always liked this game, so i put it on my kindle. I would tell a friend to pick this.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity caught me off guard.  I have never heard of it.  After 10 minutes of watching I was completely transported to another world.<br />The dialogue, script and the actors flowed so smoothly.  I discovered Firefly after watching Serenity and also have it on video.
006198969X|4.0|Really good book, Lauren is a great writer. Thoroughly enjoyed reading it and couldn't put it down once I started it.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Fall of Giants was a wonderful story about the events leading up to and including WWI from the perspective of several different types of people from different countries who were directly affected. I felt that, though fictional, I had a better understanding of the people involved in this war after reading this book, rather than just the historical facts. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that during the war, some of the war details became tedious and boring to me. Someone with greater knowledge of this war would probably find them interesting.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I didn't like it at all.............Hey l didn't think it was gonna be that sang bad... but but I'll take it
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The film was the first time I saw it on BluRay. I can't believe how perfect the scenery was. The picture was perfect. I'm glad that I bought the BluRay version. Amazon had great service. Will buy from them again.<br />.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|this is a great game only thing is that it takes so long to get coins. also everything cost alot
0547848412|5.0|Great buy. the book was brand new and came really quickly. Had no trouble with the purchase which is always a great plus!
0345345061|1.0|This did not have the Tom Bombadil stories that I read 43 yrs ago. It was ok for what it is.
B003CTWM16|4.0|Nice pool, fun for the kids. Currently we are using it as a ball pit but this summer were gonna take it outside and see how it works out as a pool. I only paid 3 bucks for it. Got it on sale. I wouldnt pay 33 dollars for it but its def worth 3 bucks LOL :)
B0022W6L6G|5.0|This has some of their best songs.  They are consummate musicians.  I can listen to them over and over again.
0847835073|5.0|This lovely woman is like good wine ...<br />time goes by and she more beautiful.<br />There are no words to describe her beauty!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This is a fun game with very nice graphics and user-friendly interface. As with all games with available in-app purchases, progress in the game can be slow and opportunities to raise coins in the game are somewhat limited. Layout can be edited and changed in gameplay. Recommended!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its an ok. Game it doesn't freeze. Its not the best but definatly not  worst. I got the game on an accident try it out
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You wouldn't think that an early an early 20th century, &#34;soap&#34; about a wealthy English family and their servants would draw you in, but it does.  It is well written and produced.  The show is balanced between the lives of the privileged class and the dignified lives of the servants.  Most of all you end up caring about the characters and become invested in their plight.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Swag game with lots of cool obstacles and challenges but it doesn't always allow<br />daily challenges. Over all a very cool game.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Excellent movie even if you haven't seen the &#34;Alien&#34; series. Excellent store line, graphics, cast and suspense. Ridley Scott is a master movie maker!
B0095XPZBC|4.0|[[ASIN:B0095XPZBC Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season Two]]<br /><br />Year: 1988   Rating: N/A   Runtime: 16 HR 39 MIN<br /><br />Aspect Ratio: 1:33.1   Video Resolution: 1080P<br />Audio: Eng 7.1 DTS-HD MA, 2.0 English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese  Subtitles: English SDH, assorted foreign subtitles<br /><br />Director: Varies<br />Writer: Varies<br />Starring: Patrick Stewart, Jonathon Frakes, Brent Spiner, Marina Sirtis, Michael Dorn, LeVar Burton, Wil Wheaton, and Diana Muldaur<br /><br />Film Rating: 3 out of 5 stars<br />Video Rating: 4 out of 5 stars<br />Audio Rating: 4 out of 5 stars<br />Extras Rating: 5 out of 5 stars<br />Overall Rating: 4 out of 5 stars<br /><br />The first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation wasn't a complete success but it proved one thing... that lightning could strike twice. Something many people thought was impossible, a new Star Trek series could survive in syndication. The question from there was whether the second season of voyages of the USS Enterprise and her crew could eclipse the success of the first season.<br /><br />Season one of TNG was unevenly written due to a revolving door of writers and the second season is even more uneven because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. That strike led to scripts from the abandoned Star Trek: Phase II to be rewritten for the TNG characters and also led to Star Trek's one and only clip show. The ratio of good to bad episodes leans more towards the bad than season one which makes working through the season more of an arduous journey than some fare weather fans may be willing to invest in.<br /><br />Even with the higher amount of `bad' episodes the character development in season two is much improved. The entire cast is given more breathing room; Picard is less stiff, Riker and Worf were injected with more humor, Wil Wheaton is less annoying, Marina Sirtis becomes a little less crazy, and Levar Burton is given a more prominent position. Diana Muldaur replaced Gates McFadden as the Chief Medical Officer, something that would only last one season. The cast is more comfortable with one another and play off each other more naturally, something that would be expanded on more in season three.<br /><br />Season Two highlights include: Elementary, Dear Data, Loud as a Whisper, A Matter of Honor, The Measure of a Man, The Icarus Factor, Q Who?, and The Emissary<br /><br />Season Two low points include (but are not limited to): The Child, The Outrageous Okona, The Royale, Pen Pals, Up the Long Ladder, and Shades of Grey<br /><br />Video and audio quality are much improved over the original broadcasts, DVD releases, and what's being shown in current syndication. The series' original aspect ratio of 1:33.1 is maintained instead of trying to reformat the show for 16:9 HDTVs. Colors and clarity have been improved by re-scanning the original camera negatives into high definition and completely reassembling the episodes. The 7.1 DTS-MA audio track is encompassing. There's a good amount of ambient sound effects, phasers and torpedoes rip across the sound field, the warp engines provide an underlying hum while on board the ship, and the dialogue is always clear and centralized. Jerry Goldsmith's opening score sounds as timeless as ever, the same goes for the episode scores of Ron Jones.<br /><br />All the special effects including the model shots, matte paintings, early CGI, and effects done on video have been re-scanned or in cases where the effects could not be salvaged have been redone. All of this work was done in house by CBS for the first season; for season two some of the work was outsourced to another company. Unfortunately, that has lead to some of the effects shots not looking as great. Some planet flybys and effects involving the Enterprise look out of place when compared to the work done by CBS. Most of these shots are still an upgrade over the standard definition effects from the show's original run but it would have been nice to have these effects be consistent throughout the show. Hopefully this is something that will be corrected for TNG's third season.<br /><br />If getting a TNG restored in 1080P High Definition wasn't enough the Blu-ray sets also include some great special features. Episode promos are available before the start of every episode, I think this is a great touch because it gives you a great glimpse of what the show resembled before the restoration. LeVar Burtons 1988 Reading Rainbow segment from when he visits the set is included, I believe this is the first time it has been made available to the public outside of reruns or viewing it on YouTube. There's also a ten minute gag reel and audio commentaries available on The Measure of a Man and Q, Who?. The best special features are available on the final disc; Reunification: 25 Years After Star Trek: The Next Generation (1 hr, 2 min) and the two part documentary Make it So: Continuing Star Trek: The Next Generation, Part 1: Strange New Worlds (39 min) & Part 2: New Life and New Civilizations (42 min). There's some overlap between them but they offer an intriguing look look at the series from both behind and in front of the camera. Reunification offers viewers a rare look at TNG with the entire cast discussing the series together while Make it So looks more at individual issues or episodes. If you watch all three you're in for a treat and and it hardly feels like two plus hours have gone after watching them.<br /><br />Before wrapping up the special features section, two versions of the heralded episode The Measure of a Man are available. A 57 minute extended cut and a 55 minute `hybrid' cut that intermixes HD footage with SD footage. There's been a lot of talk about the extended cuts of this episode and while I think a lot of the footage is interesting some of it is a little too on the noise. I still prefer the broadcast cut of the episode over either extended version.<br /><br />Season two of Star Trek: The Next Generation should be an easy sell on Blu-ray for most fans but it's not without its problems. The cast and crew start to find their `sea' legs by this point but the writer's strike really hurt this season. There are some very memorable moments in season two; TNG's signature villain is established, Whoopi Goldberg joins, and Riker grows his iconic beard but there's also the clip show, an episode with Joe Piscapo, and the one where Data wears the cowboy hat just to name a few. This is not a season I'd revisit very often but the completist in me has to have it but I'd be lying if I didn't say I sorta wish I could have skipped straight to season three.n nice to have these effects be consistent throughout the show. Hopefully this is something that will be corrected for TNG's third season.<br /><br />If getting a TNG restored in 1080P High Definition wasn't enough the Blu-ray sets also include some great special features. Episode promos are available before the start of every episode, I think this is a great touch because it gives you a great glimpse of what the show resembled before the restoration. LeVar Burtons 1988 Reading Rainbow segment from when he visits the set is included, I believe this is the first time it has been made available to the public outside of reruns or viewing it on YouTube. There's also a ten minute gag reel and audio commentaries available on The Measure of a Man and Q, Who?. The best special features are available on the final disc; Reunification: 25 Years After Star Trek: The Next Generation (1 hr, 2 min) and the two part documentary Make it So: Continuing Star Trek: The Next Generation, Part 1: Strange New Worlds (39 min) & Part 2: New Life and New Civilizations (42 min). There's some overlap between them but they offer an intriguing look look at the series from both behind and in front of the camera. Reunification offers viewers a rare look at TNG with the entire cast discussing the series together while Make it So looks more at individual issues or episodes. If you watch all three you're in for a treat and and it hardly feels like two plus hours have gone after watching them.<br /><br />Before wrapping up the special features section, two versions of the heralded episode The Measure of a Man are available. A 57 minute extended cut and a 55 minute `hybrid' cut that intermixes HD footage with SD footage. There's been a lot of talk about the extended cuts of this episode and while I think a lot of the footage is interesting some of it is a little too on the noise. I still prefer the broadcast cut of the episode over either extended version.<br /><br />Season two of Star Trek: The Next Generation should be an easy sell on Blu-ray for most fans but it's not without its problems. The cast and crew start to find their `sea' legs by this point but the writer's strike really hurt this season. There are some very memorable moments in season two; TNG's signature villain is established, Whoopi Goldberg joins, and Riker grows his iconic beard but there's also the clip show, an episode with Joe Piscapo, and the one where Data wears the cowboy hat just to name a few. This is not a season I'd revisit very often but the completist in me has to have it but I'd be lying if I didn't say I sorta wish I could have skipped straight to season three.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is very fun to play. It is a great game to play when bored and tired. Get it today!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Loved this compelling story from beginning to end. The author's ability to make you feel as if you were sharing the lives of each member of both families is uncanny. The story pulls you in, breaks your heart for all involved, and makes you want to hug your own child. A truly well written book.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Micheal Connelly somehow has managed to put together yet another Harry Bosch novel that reaches the level of perfection that his previous novels have.<br />Harry Bosch is one of my all-time favorite characters and at some point in the series one expects to be disappointed. Really, how many believable adventures can one detective have before one crosses that line into the &#34;wait a minute!&#34; category? (see James Patterson or whoever is writing his books these days) Fortunately for fans of Harry Bosch, that has not happened.<br />With typical Bosch low-key dedication, Harry tracks down a group of unlikely killers who used the chaos during the Los Angeles riots to cover a murder he investigated twenty years before.<br />You won't be disappointed in this one if you've come to admire the unorthodox and deep character of Harry Bosch and those who surround him.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Didn't really know what to expect going in, but I definitely did not feel let down.  I became so absorbed while I was reading the book that I over shot my train stop by 7 minutes before realizing my mistake.
B006LSZECO|4.0|this book kept my attention and was quite believable.  I hope that there is  a sequel.  I would recommend this book
B00797MB0O|2.0|. . . except the knowledge that there may be adults out there who still long for their high school days and lovers but refuse to admit it.  Sorry, didn't even find this one entertaining.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This movie took me by surprise. To me, the developed characters of any movie are as equally significant as the story. I rate this movie four star as it excels at both. It had the element I give a fifth star for.. (A compelling story that you can relate to so well to that it draws you in),but it was too slow implementing it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very addicting hours of my life wasted. Waiting on 3 all ready. Does slow down my phone a little. Thanks again.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Bossypants is an easy and entertaining read that taught me more about Tina Fey, life behind the scenes at SNL, and 30 Rock. It is both interesting and inspiring to actors finding their way to the top!
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Although it has been debated as to whether a Boeing heavy can fly inverted. The theory can be plausible. Either way it acquired success in entertaining. And (unfortunately) showed the sad reality that pilots do drink and fly. Denzel did a fine job in his portrayal as Whip.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Like the game but would like to create my horse.<br /><br />Graphics are very good. Wish I could gain coins more quickly.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that the game is good but it's graphics are poor .I like the characters and hover boards I play it all the time
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Outstanding! Good job PBS....Great story line and the cast is without a doubt very well thought out..... Wonder if Mitt watches it.
B0095P31L6|5.0|My son loves this movie and I do not mind watching it over and over with him. It has a cute plot.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the excellent portrayal of this time of history.  I love the array of characters, the tensions that humans bring to each other, the believeability of their acting, and the warmth of the characters.  I just happened upon this work two weeks ago, and have watched all episodes from Season 1 to the current episode.  Can't wait for more!
B0095P2TBE|4.0|I love anything paranormal. So of course I had to watch this again. I love the suspense in waiting to see when something will hapen.
B002U5HKZ6|2.0|This was a book with many action scenes and changes of pace. this was the only thing that kept me reading. I found the main character repetitive and annoying, there was  always some new skill being revealed or discovered, hard to believe.
B00407PNY2|3.0|So looking forward to this movie, originally bought it for the car racing scenes which still today cut it.  But the movie itself is dated and full of cliched nonsense, not to mention hard to understand the conversation at time.  Acting was ordinary, this film didn't fire for me.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This is the darkest creepiest tv show ever.  I couldnt sleep after the first couple of episodes.  If you like scary movies this is the show for you!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Wow! There is just so much great stuff to say about the game. Coming from the phone version, the tablet version of the app is really the perfect platform to play this game on. You get just the right amount of space to view what is going on in the game, and the right amount of space to place objects on the board. The menus are designed very well and the whole experience just flows. The game concept is really fun and I really like all the different levels and gameplay modes available. Going on a tower-defense concept it is really fun for people who like to think strategically and can be viewed as a learning game for people wanting to develop strategy. The tablet also makes the controls perfect with easy touch control! Just buy this thing, it`s amazing!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't know why I love this show so much but I do! It's so comforting to watch even though there is so much more drama. I guess I find comfort in how respectful everyone is, even when they are being mean!<br /><br />Regarding the streaming quality, I was at HD the entire time and never once did I receive a 5.1 audio signal. The black and white levels are also clipped. I'm not sure what kind of compression was used, but the show didn't look its best. Maybe the show changed the DOP?<br /><br />I'm disappointed since I just finished season 1 on Netflix streaming and the quality is so much better!
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I am now reading The Bat, which I would have started with if I were doing it over. Harry Hole has a nice dark yet sometimes sentimental perspective that resonates with me.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|The Harry Potter films are great, but the way this package is designed isn't so great. One of the hinges inside the case broke. It doesn't affect the dvd's, but it seems to me these companies that produce these packages should try them out before they mass-produce them. The hinge broke as soon as my son opened the case when it arrived.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This is an excellent science fiction movie with good action and adventure.  Great story, liked the characters.  Good for teenagers.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The Help<br />Very good movie.  It was more than I expected.  Glad I purchased the movie &#34;The Help&#34;. It helped me learn more about the past and their struggles.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I enjoyed the story, and love the John Corey humor, but wanted to more detail about the resolution, and how they got out of harm's way.  Seemed like there wasn't the usual DeMille transition and denoument.  Did set it up for another confrontation, tho - yeah!
B008133MDK|5.0|Sherlock is a great modernization of the classic Sherlock Holmes genre.  The acting is superb and they story lines are captivating.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Fast paced, entertaining, lots of legal and government intrigue, and a great ending. A great book for first-time Grisham readers, or to get back in the Grisham groove.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|We're a small IT team in a nonprofit serving people with disabilities. 50% of my dev team's time is firefighting - 80% of Ops time is unplanned. This book has kicked off a small revolution - gave a copy to both team leads.

B001FVV2X2|4.0|I love the characters, especially Walter. It is a good SiFi series with some great real life like human journeys.
B002V6RB1C|4.0|Paul Newman in his prime.  A few racy scenes which prevents anyone 16 our younger from watching it.  Definitely a must-see.
B009HELT3C|4.0|Josh Brolin was great as Tommy Lee Jones (Agent K). I would recommend this movie, even if you didn't love the first two in the series.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Very heartfelt and funny in a genuine way. Hawkes and Hunt give terrific performances. Definitely worth watching. Good if you're in the mood for something light yet moving.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|From reading the reviews and write ups, I got the impression that the book theme was spy-adventure.  Yes our heroine was a minor spy - but actually the book focused more on her various romantic relationships.  It's a little slow in places but I did finish it.  Just don't expect a fast-paced intrigue story.
B006T5C5PS|3.0|I purchased this out of curiosity I think it's a very good system they have, to help someone in need of extreme nutrition supplementation. Good to have on the shelf just in case.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|My first time seeing this series because it was not available in my area.  It is like opening up treasure.................<br />I look forward to seeing the other 6 seasons.

B001XUPGLY|3.0|Most of the film takes place in 1980s San Francisco. Spends most of its time playing off the mistakes that the crew makes because they don't understand the culture of the time. Ultimately, the story is plain stupid and unimaginative. Why would an advanced alien race care about talking to whales? Moreover, why would they come to destroy the planet to avenge the whales? Also, why does their \\"super advanced\\" spaceship look like a broken stick of grey chalk?

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although John Green generally writes for young adults, and I am an older adult, I truly enjoyed this book. Wonderfully written. Themes: strength and weakness in the face of adversity, platonic and romantic love, priorities, hope, disillusionment, “The world is not a wish-granting factory.” Highly recommend this book for anyone, at any age.
B0009FTXGI|5.0|Lost my last one and this is a fine replacement. Same dimensions and works well shielding light flare for my lens
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|This movie could have benefitted from several consultants.  I fly medevac planes over all of Alaska, and I will give you my top ten reasons why this movie isn't worth the plastic box it comes in...<br /><br />1.  The north slope has no mountains, or trees... and wolves only when the Caribou are migrating through, which doesn't happen in winter.  No one hires wolf snipers to protect oil workers.<br />2.  The first trees they come to (after leaving the slope) are huge conifers.  You have to fly over about 200 miles of tiny black spruce to get to any large trees.  Then to a canyon?  with a river with running water in winter??  Spring in the Bob Marshal wilderness in Montana maybe... but not up here.  Sorry.<br />3.  Liam just walks out of the river, and keeps on keeping on.  His clothes are dry in a few minutes.  Liam, Liam, Liam.  You need a fire.<br />4.  When the impossible 85 foot long jump has occurred, everyone decides to go across the contrivance feet first.  When you survive YOUR wolf saga, go head first.  It works better.<br />5.  Spend some time around oil roughnecks.  They are not soft voiced touchy feeling sorts.  The river scene when the biggest jerk of them all gets sort of tired and gives up is overdone.  Reality?  I would have stabbed him in the brainstem a couple of days earlier when he started to ruin morale.  There is also a scene whereupon these \\"toughened brawlers\\" are getting grossed out by (the biggest jerk) by him decapitating a wolf that they have killed and cooked as a statement.<br />6.  You don't outrun wolves.  Neither do you hear them crashing about in the woods.<br />7.  The Alpha wolf looks just about like the Wolf from \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\"; and sounds like a mother elephant urging her young toward the next watering hole.  What... real wolves aren't scary enough?  If you can afford Liam, you can afford some better special effects.<br />8.  Liam pets the first wolf dispatched, with his hunting rifle, while sort of weepy, until it is dead.If a wolf is breathing after you have shot it with a deer rifle, you shouldn't pet it.  I think it is just taking a nap.<br />9.  Why beat the black guy in the chest sorrowfully after he is dead?  They weren't close when they were alive... and a luckily placed precordial thump only works if you do it once... and not when you have died from Hypoxia... only when you are in active V-tach.<br />10.  I could care less about any of the characters.  Apparently Liam has a beautiful wife/SO somewhere, who left him.  If you get to have a chance with a beautiful woman who wants to hold you and stroke your face on clean white linens, you don't say to her \\"my Irish blood can't stand it here... I have to go be a wolf sniper on the north slope-\\"  You say \\"baby, should I make you an omelette\\"?  and then you let her decide what to watch on TV.  Forever.<br /><br />as a bonus, #11:  the best last stand you can contrive is with some broken glass knuckles and a knife?  Read Jack London.  Clubs work.

B0081336FO|5.0|This is what you do when making remake. Bring a strong actor and change the story a bit. This great at both. Cant wait for next season.
B0016698VO|3.0|REM return from their sauntering trip Around The Sun at godspeed. The songs are faster in tempo, conceptually edgier and, thanks to the help of grunge producer Jacknife Lee, more rock-and-roll than anything they've released in the past several years. If those last few albums were polished down to a nice elegant sheen, this one is, right out of the gate, from the opening guitar riff, a throwback to the old dirty garage-band days. Though I have no problem with the relaxed post-party digression REM started displaying once Bill Berry fell from the tree, there's a certain nostalgic charm to this sudden return to form.<br /><br />Lacking are the songs. In the way of sonics, the album sounds like vintage REM. The guitars are set louder in the mix, sometimes with a mild distortion effect to give them that hardcore rock vibe. Michael Stipe is still a wonderful, if ambiguous, wordsmith. But, even with Mills harmonizing softly in the background, there are few melodies to match. Until The Day Is Done stands as one of their best songs yet, the chorus on Man-Sized Wreath is a lot of fun and the Sing For The Submarine anthem is catchy, but, at a mere 34-minute stretch, the album doesn't have enough melodic gas to go the distance.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B000FCK65W|5.0|this book covers it all.  Love descriptions of houses, streets, neighbors, father, mother all family.  Just loved it. Don't know what took me so long to read this book.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|The book &#34;The Lucky One&#34; is an enjoyable read as it identifies some real life experiences and allows the reader to align with experiences that are faced by people who care about each other.  I would recommend this book to others.  Easy to read.  Enjoyable.  This book can be picked up at any time and read for enjoyment.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|After reading a few reviews on \\"Flight\\" I was hesitant to rent it for fear of expecting the worse, which means falling into a \\"this movie isn't good\\" spell of other's reviews. Without going in any depth of the story (I believe they would call it spoilers) I would just speak of why I thought the movie a good Denzel Washington flick. His work in this film mirrors his performance in \\"Training Day\\", meaning someone whom you like and dislike all in the same 2 hours. His character being someone who is lead around the story by his demons and that struggle is felt through the TV screen as good acting does. When thinking about the movie as a whole - that struggle stands out the strongest in the film even though this movie is filled with notable actors.<br /><br />If you are truly in doubt based on others opinion, I will tell you this - rent it, even for a one time watch just to see Washington at his best.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Really enjoy the second season of falling skies! Hope to see additional seasons with even stronger actors and character development.

0765325950|5.0|It was worth the wait. It's hard to believe that this journey is over. I wanted this story to end but at the same time felt sad that it was truly ending. So instead of &#34;gobbling&#34; it up, by reading nonstop, I forced myself to slow down and enjoy the very brillant writers' imagination and the epic story that unfolded.  The book is definitely a classic. If you only own a digital copy, consider buying it in hardback, it's a keeper.  So much was happening, that I found myself holding my breath during much of the book. I think Robert Jordan would be pleased.

I just wish I could find another trilogy out there as good as this - the only thing that has come close i the \\"crossfire\\" series by Sylvia Day. and the 3rd Book isn't going to be out until May or June of 2013. Wht a bummer.<br /><br />Anyone with any suggestions please I'd love to hear them.<br /><br />Thanks and enjoy the book and make your own assumptions.<br /><br />Keep Writing E. L. James.!

B005MJFA2W|4.0|This is an excellent book that made me realise further the importance of thinking and reading beyond the easy confines of accepted media outlets. Kahneman also forces the reader to question their, or rather their brain's, opinions on politics, society and why humans exist as they do. I'd recommend 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' for those interested in any of the themes mentioned above.
0756991145|4.0|Mister Pip is the 11th book by New Zealand author, Lloyd Jones. Set against the background of civil war in Bougainville in the early 1990's, the story is narrated by a teenaged island girl, Matilda Laimo. Matilda's story starts in about 1990, when her father has gone to Townsville to work, the mine at Panguna has closed, the island is blockaded, supplies of power and food are cut off and the lifestyle is like that of her grandparents. The villagers live in fear of the rambos (rebels) and the redskins (Papuan army). The school is overgrown with vines. Then, the last white man left in the village, Tom Christian Watts, nicknamed Pop Eye by the villagers, reopens the school and tries to teach their lessons. This enigmatic Mr Watts, married to an islander, Grace, gets the villagers in to teach the children what they know of life; he himself reads them Dickens' Great Expectations. Matilda and the children become wholly absorbed in Pip's tale but her strictly Christian mother, Dolores, opposes his heathen teachings with her own lessons about God and the devil. As hostilities escalate, the village suffers at the hands of the redskins; the threat of danger is also felt from the rambos, with Mr Watts having to give an account of himself that is part fiction, part fact. A violent climax tests the loyalties and spirit of many of the villagers; Matilda witnesses her mother's incredible bravery and morality. Matilda finds that Pip's story gives her the courage to save herself, to escape and eventually, to return. Jones has created a very moving tale with an unexpected twist at the end. His characters have depth and appeal; his descriptions ensure the fragrance and humidity of the jungle are palpable. He conveys the potency and magic of a story brilliantly. This is a powerful read.

B003JTHXOK|1.0|I found this book being very generic and very boring. \\"Sleeping with the Enenmy\\" with a diffrent twist. It was my first N.Sparks book that a friend let me borrow thru Kindle.  I'm glad I didn't pay for it. N. Sparks isn't for me.  Too cheesy.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I find this game soooo much fun.  It challenges you to think of unique ways to draw hints and images.  I find it hard to get my firends to play but it is great with the ones whom I play with.  Love the different colors and stroke sizes.  Quite a challenge at times.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really love this workout! I've only been able to do level 1 so far and it's still very challenging.  I have  a lot of other workout dvds but I find myself reaching for this one time after time. I bought some of Jillian's other dvds and am looking forward to trying them out (I just ordered them so they aren't here yet.) It's only 20 minutes but I'm sweating! I don't know how hard the other levels are (for those who are more fit) but I'm sure as they get progressively harder they are challenging for fit people too. A great dvd!
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Best fantasy world ever created. So rich in detail. Amazing series. Makes Tolkien look very old fashioned and kinda twee
B00498YZH8|4.0|This movie had a awesome point of view of how family can for get about others when drugs are involved.  There was awesome acting from everyone and I really enjoyed it because I was never quite sure what was going to happen next
B008WM4U7W|5.0|Donnie Yen is amazing! Good story, caring family man and still he kick's butt! Wish he would make more IP Man movies
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I was laughing through it all, Adam sander is a great vampire daddy.  It was a great point of view from the monster side
B00821OX98|5.0|The clean language along speaks for it self as compared to other tv  programs! Greatly appreciated program for family viewing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it!!! Wish it was on daily. They need to bring back the black guy and his kid from the first season. Also wish Lori was still alive, and Shane.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|What would Christmas be without it's a wonderful life. Every TV station in America shows this at Christmas time, so why not own it and watch it year round. Frank Capra's classic can be enjoyed by all ages. I got this a gift for my sister. She highly recommends it to all.
B0094K1PW4|2.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along that everyone raves about. For me this was NOT one of those movies. The plot was formulaic and the entire movie had that been there done that feeling. Character development was terrible, plot holes glaring and just too derivative for my liking. I am fan of JJ Abrams, but this one was a total non-starter. The whole ET feel to the movie was just plain cheesy and there is just nothing original about this movie and thats why it gets 2 stars
B002M5E2DW|2.0|but many friends were enthusiastic about it and I decided to read it because I cannot judge what I don't know.  well. now I know it for sure. it's a mixture of stereotypes, common sense and bulls***.
B000HF6ZR0|2.0|This is your typical formulaic sci-fi movie from the mid to late nineties. The cast is great and the move is well made and some scenes do keep you on edge. But on the whole the plot seemed quite pointless. It's okay for a casual watch but pretty meh movie overall.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app. The horses are beautiful and look real! Love it. I was unsure of this app at first, but now i am glad i got it.
B00821OW8K|1.0|the walkind dead is the new gold standard for post apocalyptic sci-fi. I am afraid this show just does not cut it. There's just too much mindless chatter, chessy dialogues and just too slow to hold my attention. I'll admit that I've just seen a few episodes and I hope its gets better but I am not holding my breath
0765325950|2.0|I actually bought two copies of this book, because I've read the past books so many times that I literally wore them out.  The last two books were profoundly disappointing, but I pushed on.  This last book is an absolute travesty.  Mat and Rand a parody's of themselves.  All of the great Captains violate their rules and let the women direct the battles, when exactly did Egwene become a tactician again?!  The battle with the Dark One was so boring, I started skipping them.<br /><br />Other people have gone on, in great detail, about how bad this book was; so I won't go into it that much.  I could pick up any of the first 10 books and pick a page at random and be entertained.  I honestly don't think I'll ever read this piece of crap again.  Now I have to find some sucker to pawn off the second book.<br /><br />Thanks a lot Brandon Sanderson, you have ruined this series; this is the worst finale since Seinfeld went off the air!!!
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|Hope every one get a chanceto watch this outstanding movie! I told my sister how I enjoy these movie and well tell friends.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|So much so, I fell asleep during the movie and plain forgot I rented it in time to try and watch it again.. figured might as well not try a second time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A great discussion piece for a bookclub -I  would highly recommend!!<br />A bit confussing at times but is all tied up in the end!
B009HELT3C|4.0|I wouldn't buy this, but it was a fun trip down the MIB franchise's series, better than 2 I thought.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is positively one of the best-produced shows that I have seen in a long time. The writing is excellent and the Director and the Director of Photography have obviously had a lot of time to figure out camera angles and cinematic transitions because the stories flow seamlessly from one scene to another. Superb lighting and locations and consistently good acting craft a really fun and enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />Interestingly, they only have done three episodes per season - an hour and a half long each. The subtle use of modern technology integrated into each episode brings the whole genre into present day without being too obtrusive. And there is a nice storyline weaved throughout each episode, knitting each episode with it's predecessor. This is a \\"worthy\\" show and one that I highly recommend for family viewing and individuals as well.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I've been listening to Muse from the begining, Show Biz.  This another great album by them.  Have they stayed the same?  No, of course not.  Does anyone what to hear the same same album, remade over and over?  Progression is how the world works, so get over it.  I like that they bring something new to each endevour.  People ask me how to describe them, and I tell them I would compare them to Queen.  Amazing vocals, interesting use of musical instruments, and an unwillingness to conform to Genre.<br /><br />Check this album out, you just might want to see how this started.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Can't go wrong with Dr, Who.  Methinks maybe better than start trek and star wars on many levels.  Do not talk during show as you will miss a lot of the funny nuances. Can watch several times.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|good movie what more can you say about a movie. The use of prime made it easy to view through the web
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Al doctor who  shows are good if are the slightest bit of a fan.  The lady who plays Donna  in this has her own show as well. It is quite hilarious nut for more mature audiences.The Catherine Tate Show is on Net Flix
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|You will absolutely love it. But you do not stay with a hourse your  whole life you get a change.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|A story of a young woman who finds her first love but with a twist.<br />Yes there were lots of sex but after a while you wanted more of the character background of Christian and this was patchy and did not always gel.<br />Erotic but repetitive, you almost knew what was coming next although the ending came sudden and left me thinking there was another chapter?<br />Glad I read it after all the hype but was it worth it'll that publicity?
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I made a lot of progress in this game and then it deleted all of my characters,  money,  and everything else. please fix the bug because I want my old progress back.!!!!
B008IBPMZG|5.0|A great mixture of simple yet complex and intertwined stories of people in their daily lives. Brilliantly written to keep you wanting more!
B00AR83PN4|1.0|This would be a great game if it worked right! Blocks won't disappear no matter how high you stack them!!!! Grrrrrrr!
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|I really liked Javier Bardem in this movie --he is an outstanding actor--<br />I really wish he was in more movies --I also  liked Penelope Cruz and think she<br />did a great job of being tossed aside by him.<br />a.veretto
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book, especially told from the dogs' point of view. You have to read this, you will take away understanding and respect in a new way on how dogs view their best friend. I hated to see the end, it's one of those reads that you wish would never have a last page, but continue on indefinitely.
B0026KX5PO|3.0|I expected a little more from this one...<br />As the stars say: &#34;It's okay&#34;<br />Damon knows how to blend in every one of his parts.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I really like this because it will hold my Fire in either portrait or landscape and the notches inside keep it locked in position.  I'm quite please with the quality and the padding makes me feel that my Fire is very well protected.  I'm very glad I bought it.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I was introduced to this book by my wife, and I started reading it casually when it suddenly occurred to me that there was more to this book than I'd originally thought. In fact, it turned out to be a manual for success!<br /><br />The principles outlined in this book help the reader understand the nature and structure of the &#34;anatomy&#34; of willpower, and the evolutionary basis of the battle between instant and delayed gratification that rages inside each of us. This understanding helps us become people with much better self-control than we'd ever normally have.<br /><br />A MUST read!
B0085W09ME|1.0|the thing is set to find flights but it cant do anything, this is too glitchy after trying it for 2 weeks I am removing it, it is supposed to find flights it only looks for china! whaat?? and wont lt you add anything else to its search criteria, dont bother with this app
B00B2V66VS|5.0|if you liked temple run you will love temple run 2.instead of a couple of small evil demon monkeys there is one big one.sometimes I die from looking at the scenery.you can even go on a zipline and a mining cart.would recommend it for everyone.thank you for taking your time to read this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest because you can always find some clever or fun way or idea to do something. Like you can look and see what funny things you or things that other people do and best of all the people that pin it up usually put how to do it or how to make it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You should buy this game if you like &quot;temple run&quot;  the first one. This one has waterfalls and a mine cart level! It also has different color coins!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Fast moving very topical on cyber threats that have received to little attention. The Chinese have been active hackers for years.
B008220BLG|5.0|The guy was Hot<br />Fffffffffffffggffg<br /><br />Peter and I can't I don't think of awesome and I can't wait for real though
B0094K1MH2|5.0|The &#34;Adventures of Tintin&#34; was fast moving; funny, yet adventuresome. Great animation. Would watch another Tintin movie if there is one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Even though I play both Temple Run's actively, this one is way more exciting! And I am dying to unlock the last character! She's so badass! It lags horribly on my iPod 4th gen, but works GREAT on my Kindle Fire HD. I recommend playing this game to everyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is captivating and so very interesting.  The problem is you do get &#34;hooked&#34; and this can interfere with getting other things done!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was written to be a steady romance novel but with such a pleasant surprise of humor throughout. The author did such a great job expressing the tension between the main characters. I read this in a day, not because it's a short book,but because couldn't put it down. I recommend this book for any mature reader
B00AGOGOLE|4.0|Great App! It does everything it says. Easy to use and takes great pics. It is exactly what I needed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy Subway Surfers.  I like the different characters and missions. This game is really challenging and enjoyable. I love the people who made this game!!!!
B007W1BLN0|3.0|The film go an OK rating from me.  It gives the audience a look into how tough Alaska survival can be.  Good at showing how not to survive in AK by yourself.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This season was so engaging, I love to see the growth of the family and the development of the women in this era!
B001BANK32|3.0|The characters are good, but the book waivers far to the left from what happens in the movie. It's almost like two completely different stories...it's alright, but not what I expected.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A good, fast read - safe for all ages. Interesting premise with a great moral thread. Believable story. I can see whay the movie is so popular.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This was a good movie.  I found the end to be a touch of a twist and has been the subject of a few conversations between my wife and I.  That's how it goes with movies that involve time travel... and again, this one I found had a twist at the end.  I wish I could say more but I won't.  Suffice... we thought it was a good movie.  It was full of action, entertaining and at times, made us think.  I'd recommend this.
B006YJIIC8|5.0|I loved seeing the old time curling irons. Of all the contraptions for curling a woman's hair this one has proved it's worth! I remember full well all the different types of \\"curlers\\" throughout the decades and would have thrown them all in the trash for one curling iron, if it had been available, in the 50's, 60's, 70's and beyond, until our modern day and the return of a time honored friend. Some things never die and shouldn't.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Over all, this was a good movie.  We found a few of the &#34;challenges&#34; that he had to deal with in this movie to be a bit convenient... I just can't give this 5 stars... but 4.  Lots of action, but some predictability too.  bummer on that.  I would recommend this for others as would my wife.  Can definitely see how future movies would be pretty awesome now that the groundwork was laid out in this movie.
B009AMALLM|3.0|Not a huge scary movie fan, but this was more suspense than scary. First Paranormal Activity is the best by far out of the four movies. But I have a feeling they will be making another as long as each one makes some form of money. Rent on Amazon Prime if you can, but not really worth the money to buy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I found this game great as I like temple run 1 and 2 so this was really good and fun
145210655X|5.0|Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my partner who is a huge Star Wars fan. He loved it! Giggled often while reading it. I've read a little of the book and it's really cute.
B008WZHWCE|1.0|Don't let the starring of anthony hopkins fool you, he's only in this movie for a short scenario......you'll spend the movie watching for him, and he's there and then he's gone. The rest of the movie is filled with unknowns or little seen actors you may or may not even know.....the movie tries for high spiritual lessons......it's 2 hours of your life you can never get back. Skip it and move on.
0670026182|5.0|\\"What Katie ate\\" isn't just another cookbook, but a book that really gives you eager to go in the kitchen and cook!<br />All her recipes look mouth-watering without being too complicated or fussy.<br />The food styling and photos of the book are just as perfect as on her blog (that you should visit if you don't know it yet!): no too staged or inaccessible- you simply want to dive into the dish and get a taste!<br />The design of the book is unique: you can feel Katie's eye for design, it looks like the cookbook you may have inherited from a cherished relative.<br />Recipe introductions give great tips about the recipe or the kind of side dish you can have along with the main dish, etc. Katie's tone is never intimidating: reading her book is like sharing a delicious dinner with a friend. I would definitely offer this book to someone who loves good honest food and gathering with friends around a table of delectable treats! Above all, Katie proves that you don't have to be a chef or go to any cooking school to know how to get food right: just like most of us at home!<br /><br />----<br /><br />\\"What Katie Ate\\" n'est pas juste une livre de cuisine, mais bien plus que ça : il donne vraiment envie de foncer dans sa cuisine pour se mettre à... cuisiner !<br />Toutes les recettes de Katie font saliver sans paraître trop compliquées ou chargées (on peut facilement trouver les ingrédients, etc.)<br />Le stylisme et les photos du livre sont juste aussi parfaites que sur son blog (vous devez aller le voir si vous ne connaissez pas !) : rien n'est trop mis-en-scène ou inaccessible, on a juste envie de plonger dans le plat pour goûter.<br />Le graphisme du livre est unique. On peut sentir les goûts sûrs de Katie en matière de design: il ressemble à un livre précieux qu'on aurait pu hérité d'un parent proche.<br />Les intros aux recettes donnent de bons conseils sur la recette ou le genre de plat qu'on peut servir en accompagnement, etc. Le ton de Katie n'est pas intimidant: on a l'impression en lisant son livre de partager un délicieux diner avec un ami.<br />J'offrirais définitivement ce livre à quelqu'un qui aime la bonne bouffe et les réunions simples avec des amis autour d'une table remplis de délicieux mets !<br />Enfin, Katie prouve qu'on n'a pas besoin d'être un chef ou d'aller à l'école culinaire pour savoir cuisiner, tout comme la plupart d'entre nous à la maison !
B008Y5F7YW|5.0|be careful getting this movie on kindle &#34;free&#34; prime membership.....even when you have paid your $80 fee for the year they can still charge you. I watched the first half on this on monday night for free......when I went to finish it on tues night it was suddenly a &#34;pay&#34; movie......believe me, they have every angle figure out to get you to pay....and pay....and pay....and pay
B00A80SHFM|5.0|Received in really good time had a complication with the order with both my mom and I both ordering the same thing was corrected in record time very good experience
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink has done what he does best, write a compelling and well researched book. By first smashing some traditional myths about selling, he then provides research to guide our new thinking about this age old profession.<br /><br />Pink gives us a new model of ABC from the tired &#34;always be closing&#34; acronym that has served us through the last 50 years. ABC now becomes attunement, buoyancy, and clarity and shows us a better to enhancing the client -salesperson relationship, that is outcomes based.<br /><br />If you're going to read a sales book this year, make To Sell Is Human your first choice.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|traditional , like little house on the prairie  with Laura Ingels.  love the story line and the people that tell the stories
B00004Z4WR|5.0|The movie was in better condition than I expected, it wasn't scratched or did not skip, the box was not beat up either. It came in before the promised time too.
B008M721MS|4.0|really very cool!! worth the purchase. better than on my smartphones. recommended to have if you like face to face conversation.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I am a fan of Tommy Lee Jone.  I decided to watch this movie because it was filmed in Louisiana.  I am glad I did watch.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book was well written and really did keep me on the edge of my seat.  I recommend the book to those that love 48 hours or Dateline because it's very similar to those types of stories.  I did look up a couple of things in the book about the DNA that is referenced in the book and found that to be very interesting.  The ending of the book was disturbing to say the least and has made me think about people we meet in passing.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I hope the next book explains Mr Grey's past,and that there is more to the relationship than angst filled sex.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you like period series this is a perfect series to watch.  Maggie Smith provides the giggles, she is so great as the Dowager Countess.  There is happy, sad, drama, everything you would want to follow.  Love the Abbey, the staff running  the Abbey is as exciting as the family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its AMAZING. Fun. Fantastic a awesomely epic game that i LOVE I play it everyday.  . . . . . Did I mention its AMAZINGLY AWESOME and Epic hope u liked my review.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Five stars....Because this series is GREAT on every level. Very pleased I could buy the episodes on Amazon, and finish the seasons !
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like it but the second time I tried to log in it glitched and took me back to the main menu of my kindle fire.please fix this bug.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book made me cry. Twice. This book is one of the best books I've EVER read. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AJRQLTI|1.0|I own many of the songs from the movie as sung by different people. None of the versions from the movie come close to versions I already have. The only one that came close was Eponine's version of \\"On my Own.\\" She was one of the few real singers in the movie. The other songs are sung by actors with OK singing voices. I have seen the play and the earlier, non singing, movie version and liked them. This version did not do it for me. Save your money and buy the soundtrack from one of the Broadway casts. Glee has some better versions as well.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Didn't like it that much, wasn't interesting until they started killing people.  Maumau was not believable.  But we sort of liked her anyway,
B001FB4W0W|1.0|The books were great and I have read every one of them, but the tv series is horrible and I would NOT recommend that anyone watch it.  It bears almost no resemblance to the books.
0143039431|4.0|Fine quality. This book is part of my required reading for my class. The book came on time. The story was great.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Love the movies! Christian Bell is the Best Batman ever! Now that they introduced Robin in the Dark Knight Rises I hope they make the fourth part. Great collection! Thanks!
0307719219|5.0|Good quality and very informative. This book is part of my required reading for my class. The book came on time.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Could also be called a vegetarians promotion of their philosophy to those engaged in high exercise level lifestyles.<br />Yes I really did enjoy this book even though at times it did read like a hard push commercial for vegetarianism.<br />I would recommend it to anyone into moderate to high levels of physical exercise. You may not get converted but you will learn some things.<br /><br />Ignore the pages of references to other materials unless you are spending more time sitting around reading about doing it rather than doing it. Personally I found them tedious rather than helpful. 1-2 key references are helpful
B003UESJEW|4.0|A well acted and sold story about the effects of the 2008 Recession on American business.  Ben Aflek and Tommy Lee Jones do an excellent job in this film.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in the human stories behind the recent economic<br />problems in the US.
B000I62JBE|4.0|The heist movie formula: take an aging, down-on-his-luck thief and pair him with a hotshot new partner.  Ask him to steal something worth millions of dollars from the most secure safe in the known universe.  Add a love interest, a couple of double-crosses, and stir.  So much the better if the actors are top-notch, the location's scenic, and the music's good.  There you go!  Nothin' to it, right?<br /><br />I grew up a generation too late to really get to see Marlon Brando in the theatres.  Even in the Godfather, he's getting up there, but in the fifties, Brando was a god.  Likewise, I was too young to see De Niro's best work in the theatres.  No Goodfellas, Raging Bull, or Chinatown for me.  Thankfully, I've gotten to see Ed Norton on the big screen.  Here, I get a treat--all three at once.  Even though Brando's a balding, obese old man, the way he delivers his lines is something special.  He doesn't space his words as most people would speak, and as a result, he leaves you hanging on each word.<br /><br />Norton, however, steals the show.  He switches between a cocky, up-and-coming thief, and a mentally disabled assistant janitor.  He has to pull the switch mid-scene several times and nails it.  Perhaps he's not the most convincing Special Olympian--he simply doesn't have the facial features of most of the Down's Syndrome folks I've met--but he'd fool me for five or ten minutes.  I'd like to meet him in person sometime; I'm curious if the brash young baddie he plays in many of his roles (The Score, The 25th Hour, Fight Club, Rounders) is just an extension of who he is naturally, or if he's typecast somewhat.<br /><br />As a jazz fan, I heartily approve of the movie's soundtrack, which mixes live cuts of Cassandra Wilson and Mose Allison (at least I assume they're live) with old recordings from Clifford Brown and Cannonball Adderley, and a score from an underrated bass player, Charnett Moffett.  I first heard Moffett on Mulgrew Miller's amazing album, Wingspan--beena fan since.<br /><br />Last, and mostly least, I liked Nick's hacker partner: \\"I'm on the phone, bitch!\\"<br /><br />To his own mother!
037582913X|5.0|Read this to my son over and over and over when he was young.  Then I purchased it for him to read to his sons.  Which he does over and over.  It is fun to read and act out with them.  They will never forget it and it will become a gift that lasts eternity.
B0013UN9DQ|5.0|Such a beautiful album. Exquisite.  Air so such an amazing collective - and i such an amazing accident. I love the new mixes they created for this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever no hitches and nothing to complain about get the game.all though it's awkward that the fat police man can catch you.
B00511ONPG|4.0|Great book if you're new to social media.  It doesn't really provide any ground-breaking tactics which can be used and doesn't really show you or guide you on how to write a social media strategy, but it definitely gets you well acquainted with the behavioural dynamics of social media as well as the benefits.
B0060CRM6M|5.0|My two year old watched this at least once a day. Good buy for us. Love the graphics and the songs.
0061914177|5.0|This is such an inspirational book! If you were ever thinking about starting a blog and/or are wanting to but just not sure how to start, then you need to read this!  it will kick you in the butt to start blogging. Every time I ever get lazy with Fragrance Talk, I just pick this book up and read a few pages and i've got my drive back. Thank you so much for this book Gary V!
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Fabulous movie-was in high school when all this went down-<br />true account of everything-well written script, acting was phenomenal<br />BONUS Feature was incredible to hear from the 6 hostages (house guests) and<br />the Canadian couple in the Canadian Embassy and Former President Jimmy Carter<br />Highly recommend this movie!
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|This game is cute and does have pretty good graphics, but it's just your generic facebook type of game. You basically just sit around waiting to collect coins. Honestly, I'd rather pay two dollars for an app that is fun than play a &quot;free&quot; one that consists of just sitting and doing nothing. I can't wait for this genre of game to become obsolete.
B007SGM084|5.0|Whats not to love?  Cant wait for the movie!  HOT HOT HOT!  I was surprised at the sincerity of Christian.  It added a whole new depth to the story.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is amazingly awesum I wud recommend dis 2 my m8s and also fink ofer ppl who lyks dis game shud also recommend it 2 dere m8s
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the series.  I have advanced purchased the 3rd book...cant wait.  somewhat disappointed as to how long of a wait for that book.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I got this cpu like a week ago in its great.I over clocked it to 3.8 ghz and its one of the top 3 cpu.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|The hard back provides additional protection. The soft cover works well with multiple positions. I would recommend this to anyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awsome game âaaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaaa aa aaa aaa aa
B0019IB0II|4.0|I sought out this book because a Conversations With God teacher/facilitator mentioned its value.  Interestingly, this text fit right into psychology classes I am participating in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is great. I'm addicted It's challenging. I love running games. But subway surfers surfers is my favorite because you don't have to tilt to move. It make it so much easier. I could say more but that would take to long. So keep up the good work!!!!!!<br /><br />  *~Jocelyn~*
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book had a very cynical view of youth and community life.  I kept waiting for some kind of word of redemption, but it came very little, very late.  I am not sorry I read the book, but would be cautious in who I recommend it to.  I think it ended about one chapter too soon......or about thirty chapters too late.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is VERY VERY ADDICTING!!!! It is one of the funnest games ever! I really recomend you to get it
0316227706|5.0|I love dogs and the facial expressions captured in this book were so good.  It is enjoyable to look at again and again.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It was fun, but they didn't give you many colors. Also, it took forever to send. I think I would have given it more stars if it weren't for that. I still like it. You should get it and try it since it's free.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This books is phenomenal! Cant put it down, must read! I open the second one the minute I closed the first!  <3
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I like this app, but it's not as good as the one that costs money. They are pretty much the same except the demo has a shorter time limit. The other one lets you play forever(until the battery runs down). I don't even have time to build a shelter!!!!!!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I bought this book for something to read while I was sick in bed. It killed some time but was overall very predictable and disappointing. The main character, running from an abusive husband, is paranoid and afraid of trusting anyone ... for all of five minutes. The only unique thing about this book is the characters, and while they begin well, once the story gets into its groove, it moves along like a smooth, eventless drive down a Kansas highway. Well written but ... very little new to see her either.<br /><br />And, the kindle price is, as always, disappointing. Very nearly the same price on the kindle as the paperback, and I can't share it with my friends nor will I read it again.
B0053O89K6|5.0|excellent I love it even though I have not watched would recomend this service to anyone. I am lucky it is not available in blue ray in Australia.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|My son requested this for his birthday. I was able to buy it and have it shipped and arrive well before his special day and surprise him with it! He was very happy to now own his favorite trilogy!!
159420411X|5.0|Just the fact that a leader is thinking about this is a good sign.  give it to all your new team leaders and first line supervisors.  Use a book reading lunch group approach to get out the concepts and for peole to learn.
B00821OX98|5.0|Watched first season and had to catch up on season 2. Great quality show.  At long last some good scify on an American station.  Great quality video and audio with no lags.
B008A31UO4|5.0|This is guide I referenced in write up to the learning Bayesisn book.  Very helpful and written clearly.  Use it all the time.  Hard to find in paper back get it as e book.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Obviously it has the more famous songs on it but they have other quality and well produced songs. The album is well thought out.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Good to read and reread frequently- makes you realize how much more you could be accomplishing. Highly recommend for those who feel capabile but not focused yet.
B008220D5K|2.0|What are the expectations you have for yourself? Successful career, comfortable home, happy family? What if all of that were in jeopardy and you had no way to save it? What would you do?<br /><br />  Pete and Debi (who we were first semi-introduced to in the 2007 film Knocked Up and played again by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann) are married, have two children, and both own their own businesses. Pete (Rudd) has left a major record label to open his own independent label where he can work with musicians he's passionate about. Debi (played by Leslie Mann) owns and operates her own clothing store with two employees. Those employees are Jodi (played by Charlene Yi) who Deb considers a friend and a valued employee, and Desi (played by Megan Fox) who may or may not be stealing from the store but, with the huge influx of male shoppers thanks to her looks, those losses might be inconsequential. Pete is trying to drum up major public interest in a reunion album for a group that has great meaning to Pete personally but who's never been particularly well-known. At the same time, Pete and Debi are both turning 40 within days of each other. Their two daughters, Sadie and Charlotte (played by director Apatow and lead actress Leslie Mann's real-life daughters Maude and Iris Apatow) fight constantly. In addition, Sadie, Pete and Debi's 13 year-old (played by Maude Apatow) has developed an unhealthy obsession with Lost. To add even more fuel to the fire, Pete has been loaning money to his father, Larry (played by Albert Brooks), in secret. In contrast, Debi and her father, Oliver (played by John Lithgow) rarely speak.<br /><br />  I didn't really enjoy This is 40 that much. I have never been a big fan of Apatow's other films. They always seem to go for the gross-out factor and I have a low-tolerance for that type of humor. Also, there seems to be some sort of revelation every half-hour in this movie. \\"I don't know what we're going to do\\" and then twenty minutes later \\"we're all going to be okay\\". Apatow fans might enjoy this movie, I most definitely did not. I don't recommend This is 40.be okay\\". Apatow fans might enjoy this movie, I most definitely did not. I don't recommend This is 40.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book. It's so jam packed with so much stuff about Greek mythology, but it's written in a readable format. I actually didn't realize I was learning so much about Greek mythology until halfway through the book, I looked up some of the things about Greek mythology on the internet, and everything is all spot-on accurate.<br /><br />This book is about Percy Jackson, a son of one of the gods. But Percy doesn't realize he's a demigod and he spends most of the book trying to figure out who his father is. It's funny because it asks the question of: What if all of the old Greek gods and monsters were still around in present day? It's a very well crafted adventure story, too. I wish all adventure books would have endings that were this awesome.<br /><br />If these books would have been around when I was in 7th grade, I could have learned more just reading the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series than I did in all of my 7th grade.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Truly entertaining + truly educational. I know a lot of stuff makes this claim, but this is one of the few that actually delivers<br />+A huge step forward in learning theory<br />+Even if you have only the mildest interest in Greek mythology, you must read this book<br />+Percy is such a fun, real character<br />+Great supporting characters<br />+Teaches you more quickly about Greek mythology than any other method<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The movie was horrible, in comparison to this book. I hope they remake the first movie before they try to do a sequel.
B009AMALGM|4.0|My problem with ALL the P.A. movies is simply one thing....WHY ARE THEIR SCENES SHOWN IN THE PREVIEWS OF EACH & EVERY ONE OF THESE MOVIES THAT ARE NOT IN THE MOVIES I BUY? I have NEVER had that happen in ANY OTHER MOVIE!! It is VERY FRUSTRATING! ***SPOILER***  For instance, in previews for P.A.3 not only are there quite a few scenes w/the girls Mom that aren't in the movie,but there's an ENTIRE CHARACTER that's in several preview scenes,who isn't shown in the movie(seems2be some1 who's trying to help them~at one point he's sitting at table w/Mom&Boyfriend, he begins to speak&gets thrown backwards chair&all)VERY AGGRAVATING to me because I'm spending my$ on these movies expecting to see everything I saw in previews&MORE...BUT what I get is LESS!! Its yet another reason I'm so pleased w/ AMAZON.I can wait til the DVD is a penny b4 I buy it&if preview scenes aren't there,I'm still upset,not as much as in past when I dropped $30.00 on brand new DVD!!Still, I'd REALLY LIKE2C ENTIRE MOVIE!!
0316069434|4.0|Another excellent story in the Harry Bosch series. Harry tries to solve a cold case murder set against the back drop of the 1992 riots in LA. The case becomes cloudy because the victim's reason for being in LA may not be what it seems. Harry battles time, racism, internal politics and the most cold-hearted villain you may ever meet.<br />One thing I appreciate about the Harry Bosch series is that Connelly has let his hero age over the course of the stories. Harry is not the Harry of the first book.<br />If you haven't read any of the other Harry Bosch stories, don't be concerned. Connelly does a great job of filling in the blanks with bogging down the story.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Can hardly wait to move on to Point of Retreat! Just love these characters and their story. Love love love!
B002VQ7PVS|1.0|The movie encouraged me to read this book. I agree with many of the negative or lukewarm reviews about how the story is written. But one star for a Kindle version that no one on the sales side evidently has read. In many places one page is missing, so it not only interrupts the reading but leaves the reader wondering what is missing. Bad job.
B000KK0AKU|2.0|I was looking forward to finally watching this movie. When it came out I was in my 20's and did not get around to it. I always thought 'well it is a movie that I would prefer to watch in my living room with the right guy'. Well now many years later...I wish I had watched it before there were so many truly fabulous movies that I have seen in the last 25 years.  What a disappointment :(  and not a turn on at all!
B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|The Blu-ray version of \\"Peter Pan\\" leaves nothing to be desired; the technical aspects are extraordinarily well done.  And as an artifact of the post-WWII boom years in America, this is a real window into the mindset of the time.  The choices made about what to leave out of the original story and what to expand don't measure up in hindsight as much as \\"Cinderella\\" or \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" do.  So, bearing that in mind, it is best as a remembrance of seeing the film as a child.  However, the best part of the Blu-ray is the documentary, \\"Growing Up with Nine Old Men.\\"  This featurette alone is worth the price of the disc.  It is a magnificently well done look back at the time that this and other classic Disney films were being made.  The children of the animators give their perspectives on growing up around the Disney studio and provide a lovely and, by the end, emotional, tribute to this extraordinary group of creative artists.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great for curing boredom. graphics are very well done. it is very realistic. it even poops! so you should buy this if you're Bored or something. so yeah.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Not the standard planetary adventure.  A fight for survival, but not against hostil aliens or unknown space events.  It was a long time waiting for something as original and interesting as this book.  Highly recommended.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Its like revisiting the cinema experience while you ride the train, the bus or drive the car. The performances of the artists are all so gripping and the visual imagery so rich and easy to recall with this recording. Its one my current favourites.
B000065M05|5.0|Gun's N Roses first smash record, totally great. I loved Guns N Roses before any of my friends knew who they were and I got cooler turning them on to it - funny, huh? LIES, with their acoustic version of &#34;You're Crazy&#34; is a MUST BUY too.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Not at all what I expected.  It was a ok book, not something I'd read again.  Definitely doesn't live up to past review.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This was an entertaining and engaging series. I did not find any more seasons to watch after season one. Too bad.
0547848412|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It was actually planned as a gift to our 11 year old grandson. My husband, who usually does not read books, checked it out and was so faszinated that he finished it in no time. It is my turn now. He thinks it might be a little too much for an 11 year old yet.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Got totally hooked on the first season. Now I am in love with the characters and cannot believe the twist and turns.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This book is revolutionary. It helped me learn how to take care of my hair, stop damaging it, and accept my curls l rather than fight them. My only complaint that the videos and audio didn't work on my phone :( but that's not the booke fault, it's my devices. Btw, I'm only about a month into this method and my hair has shown amazing improvement. Definitely worth the read for curly haired friends. :)
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I am a normal 60 year old and did not watch this because of Zombies. I broke down because of all the good reviews.my husband and I loved it. We like Homeland and shows like that.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good game! I love that you actually have to think of what needs to be done next. I love strategy games
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Love this show! This show is a lot like Downton Abbey. Well cast and beautiful costumes. Wish it was still being shown!
B009DP9D6A|5.0|If you are a fan of Electronic Dance Music (EDM), this is a must buy. deadmau5 is one of the best.
B005DZMNHA|4.0|Loved &#34;Road to Hell&#34; and this collection follows that genre very well. To me the melodies stand alone and the lyrics only serve to strengthen their message.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This production is extremely entertaining.  The costuming is awesome and the character development is believable.  I would highly recommend this.
B0037VNX44|2.0|Interesting, but moved so slowly and with no apparent sense of direction. Bronson's story is interesting and I think Hardy did a fair job of acting, but it seems the writing was weak and the directing not much better.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|Having never had a desire to read anything by King (other \\"On Writing\\" because of his skill) due to my dislike of his genre, I reluctantly began \\"11/22/63\\" because it was next on my book club list.  Having been assured by my fellow reading club members that it was not King's usual macabre gore, and that time travel sci-fi was central to the story, I dove in.<br /><br />What a major disappointment!  Not only did it describe unspeakable gore, I can't recall a more boring read, and King has none of the scientific touch of a real sci-fi writer with which to make it potentially based in believable physics.  For those who dislike Stephen King's writing, I recommend continuing to ignore him in this most recent of his novels.  B-o-o-o-o-ring (snore).
B0094K1QR8|4.0|Well written, flowed well. Portman is great and Kucher is better then usual. I was very pleasantly surprised. You will be too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put my kindle down.  Great read!  I can't wait to finish the second book which I exchanged for this one in the Amazon Prime lending library!  And I can never read a book from beginning to end without a million things distracting me, so that is saying something.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Wasn't sure how this movie would unfold, but enjoyed its evolution. The boy who plays the lead was great. Very enjoyable science fiction.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game.  Changing the subway scenary would make it an cooler gaming experience. This game is addictive.  Once you play you will not want to stop.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love this game.  I love the new items such as the silliness and the mine.  i played it for 4 hours the first day. when I tried to play today it would not open.  the imago screen would come on but it jumps back to the app on my carousel. I am bummed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I couldn't put down the book, hunger games is the new Harry potter!  Don't worry about getting bored with this.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|The first purchase on the Wii program for Amazon Instant Video.<br />Good picture and sound.  Even turned on the CC and worked wonderfully.<br />Thank you for making it available.
B0086221SS|1.0|The acting was forced, the characters were bizarre, and the soundtrack is filled with harmonicas.  If you enjoy the feeling of watching mentally unstable people interact, you'll love this movie.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Very good show. Will watch all of the next seasons to come. I will recommend to others to watch for sure.
B007MJT1K2|4.0|It's a little strange to see a Nickelodeon film that deals with the weighty subject of hallucination-inducing alcoholism, but overall a really fun movie.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is an amazing book. If you like The Alchemist this is in the same vein. When I finished reading it I was so sad it was over I began reading it again.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was a novel you couldn't put down because it kept you interested wondering what was going to happen next.
B002HFWBUI|5.0|Great movie.  Was a real treat to see Mickey Rourke back in the day.  He was soooooooo handsome.  Good acting, too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show, love this season... just awesome and don't foget a new season starts tonight. Make sure and watch
B007EECSFA|5.0|Escape into another world and time with rich characters and complex stories that interleaved to form a beautiful fabric-couldn't put it down.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|This reboot of the Muppets is awesome!  We watched this as a family and thought it was really good.  It's funny and family friendly and classic Muppets.  My daughter loves it and wants to sing with Kermit (she's 3).  I'm very glad we purchased this movie.

B001DTPZNY|4.0|The more I watch this movie the more I like it.  There is a lot to keep track of when Indy is following the trail of the skulls.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|After reading 19 Minutes, I fell in love with Jodi Picoult's books. As a law student, the mixture of emotion, courtroom drama, family issues and the dynamic characters, I can't put her books down. The Pact was my favorite book so far. The characters constantly surprise you in this book.  You grow to love the ones you least expect to love and dislike others you wish you could like.  This is certainly not a predictable story by any means. Picoult uses the topic of teen suicide in a very interesting and touching way. I'd recommend this story to anyone looking for an exciting book different from those typical love stories with predicable endings. I couldn't put this book down.
0307887898|5.0|I am on the last chapter of this book. It was a fast read and it totally changed the way I plan to bring my start-up to success. I love this book and it's methodology.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|After seeing the movie, I had to get the soundtrack. Quality is clear and I don't care what anyone says - the rawness of the singing really did make the movie!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This album has been playing in the car, on rotation, since I day I received it in the mail. I cannot remember the last album where I have absolutely LOVED each and every single song on the album. There are only 10 songs, and leaves you wanting so much more! Each song has its own life, own soul to it. MY favorite is numbers 1, 5, 7, and 10! But seriously, I really love all of the 10 songs on there. I gave it to a guy friend (and no he's not gay) to listen and he instantly liked it - he's more of the Hip-hop/R&B type too.
B002OFWG7E|4.0|Listened to this CD on the Internet. Thought it was great and wanted to get the CD. Found it on Amazon for a good price and order it. Listen to it quite often and anyone who is a Foo Fighter fan will like this CD.
B00005JKOI|5.0|It was nostalgic, romantic, took me back to another time when adolescents were becoming adults and still struggling as young adults without the mantel of the burden of the universe on their shoulders, just the burden of their small, encroaching world. . . something more bearable to deal with than now.  We should give young people today a greater opportunity to act with both sense  and sensibility is the message of this classic film.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Until this book Demille was my favorite mystery/action author. The lead character here, John Corey, has become repetitious and predictable. For example: He just kept repeating and repeating what a terrible place Yemen is.and that he was suspicious of one of his colleagues. Please Mr. DeMille forget John Corey for a while and get back to what you do so well. My friends and I used to be in awe of how well you handled diverse subjects: Russia, mafia, Israel, Twin Towers. etc.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is one of the most awesome books I have ever read.<br />Once I started I couldn't stop reading it.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. It doesn't stoop to the mindless nonsense that most of the other scripted sit-coms pander to. It manages to be intelligent and hilarious simultaneously. A great box set for a great show. Highly recommended.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved it. The plot wasn't really based on saving Hera. But it was solely based on getting Jason's memory back. Rick kept the fights spaced out so it wasn't BAM BAM BAM!!! I can't wait to read the next book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just keeps getting better...the only down side to &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is that there are very few episodes for each season (series), but it does create anticipation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is awesome  I highly recommend temple run players get this it's similar. make sure to stack up those coins
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|Great movie all it needed was Vin Diesel in it then it would have been perfect!  Other than that there's nothing else to say!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I enjoy it honestly. I can text my friends (obviously if they have it) and it is very quick. It has never let me down. GET THE APP. IT IS THE BEST.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|It is so wonderful to watch these episodes again after such a long time.  I miss Kai Opaka!!  It's great to see the story lines beginning, and the relationships starting to unfold.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It is a board game, so you definitely need a table! That is the only difficulty playing this game. The rules are easy to explain and it is really very exciting (especially when you roll a 7 - the robber!). The quality of the stuff inside the box is amazing! The game is for two to four players, and as we usually have more than four guests, we decided to buy an extension for 5-6 players. I would recommend the game for everybody looking for the ways of entertaining their guests!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put the book down. I promise you'll fall in love and will not regret reading this for sure.
B0050SYS5A|4.0|You get what you pay for when you get this product.  Great for a person like me who lives in a small apartment and what to enjoy there Kinect.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Could not put the book down. I promise you'll fall in love and will not regret reading this for sure.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My family really enjoyed watching this movie. The plot centers around a fear of people and finding true love or zing. The characters were not scary and I'd recommend the movie to anyone with kids.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a perfect GAME for horse lovers like me,also THIS GAME is not a blurry screen game.<br />So download it now!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My brother told me numerous times; watch this show!  Watch it!  I thought it's just a tv series and cannot be anything great.<br />He was right and I was wrong.  Watch one episode (preferably the 1st one) and you will agree.<br />Great show of a great past time.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I love Tom Clancy Books. Now that I have a tablet I can load multiple books on it to read.  I can study an I can do leisure reading on the same device without the hard copy.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|The author has an incredible way of mixing fact with fiction in such a way that makes the story frightening and \\"real\\" - very similar to Dan Brown. Rollins excels at keeping your attention by keeping the action going on multiple fronts - all with hair-raising adventure and startling surprises. A really great read - highly recommend if you like adventure, mayhem and mystery on a level that almost reaches the supernatural!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|As the other movies I loved it. I wonder if there is going to be another one of these movies?
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was a well written true story. The acting was flawless. My sister and I believed the characters. So much so that we started to research online to find out more. I think it's a sign of a great movie when you are moved to stay with it after the on screen action stops!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Note: first 10 pages or so might seem boring, STICK with it! You won't regret it! Great book for a book club discussion
B00542UMIY|1.0|The sound needed to be turned all the way up and the video quailty was very poor. The movie is good but I wouldn't get it through amazon.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A different take on a classic love story but absolutely amazing!!! Reminds me a little of the twilight plot minus the vampire scene so anyone looking for something similar should definitely look into this!
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|I enjoyed the film but I would not say it was worthy of best animated film nomination. Once was enough
B00006AG5N|4.0|Great CD<br />My husband loved it.  The perfect gift for Christmas.<br />Would recommend this CD to any Elvis lover.<br />He was surprised with the quality.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|I love it It's a really good show can wait to see next season Can be Weird some parts !
B00AREIAI8|3.0|fun game for my five yo but she wonders why we cannot buy more jewels. jumps are easy to do
B009O2XY12|4.0|this is a gun game. I dont like that it uses lives and is not continuas playing. Other than that it's a blast.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher always feels bigger than life without being unbelievable.  Perhaps it is his spartan lifestyle.  This is book #1 in the series, but don't think you have to read them in order.  In this book Jack creates justice, in his style.  What I found interesting was the knowledge I gained from the work of Jack's brother Joe.  The information about currency really gets you thinking.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was a good end to this series. But honestly I didnt like all the sex in any of these three books. I found the story without the sex was good its self.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|I loved this movie so much that I bought it. It is a movie that makes you believe it is moving in one direction when it surprises you at the end.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this is a lot better than the first game with the zipline and mineshaft as well as the upgrades being cheaper for the average player.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I am not sure if this version of \\"Total Recall\\" is the remake of the one that Mayor A. Schwartzenneger stars. Plot is sci-fi as far as it can be. Romance is intriguing. Action - impeccable. Love the last scene. Rented from Instant Videos, enjoyed so much I plan to buy the dvd now.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I love this show. I wish I would have started watching it when it first debuted, but the upside is I have Fringe marathons when I'm at home sick.
B000JML7EC|1.0|Sorry I'm only ESL . I don't understand what the book talk about ,for me is nothing ,i will deleted it read it after 10 years when my english is better
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a really good game i cant belive it came out on kindle i like how you have more control over the kindle fire more than any other device great game love it :)
0307719774|5.0|You can record your life for 5 years .so what can you complain about &#62; Get it .I love it .,see 5years later
B0016CP1Q4|5.0|just good. And that was what I anticipated. Every bit as Bluesy and Trashy, yet worthy of purchase!<br />yea, music.
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|Sorry I'm only ESL . I don't understand what the book talk about ,for me is nothing ,i will deleted it read it after 10 years when my english is better
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Its a very overrated Game bad Voice Over Bad Graphics Small Map not very many guns or vehicles only 23 missions. Dont let the pictures make your decision to buy it because Its very overrated Bad game short Stupid Ummm very boring. Bottom Line is dont buy it it sucks even the soundtrack because thats 7$ youll never get back. Save your money for GTA 5.
0312117337|5.0|i'm a 35 years tarot reader .I think if you like tarot you need this one .i used it for my life
B0094K1WZE|2.0|This movie is so phony, it's an insult to one's intelligence.  The special effects are greast! Its appeal isin the action scenes that can only appeal t morons.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent I loved it<br />I would recommend this as a must read. Never guest the ending. Another great book by sparks.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Its a great series love the Terminator movies. please keep it going. would tell any body that likes the movies to watch the Sarah Connor Chronicles
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I'd heard many good things about this series from several people whose taste I respect, so I decided to give it a shot. I'm hooked and into the 2nd season already. If you enjoyed the format of the X-Files before the show went off the rails, this may be right up your alley. Recommended.
B000QY9WOU|5.0|Her usual great self.  This video includes a collage of her very old stuff and clips from her TV show.  Both the new stuff and old were great.  I would highly recommend this video.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|It is just okay, it could have been much better. I am an Eastwood fan but it was a bit slow.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app for my Droid.  Easy to use and handy to always have at your fingertips.,  I use it a lot.
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellant books, couldn't put it down. Will probably read it again!  Captured by the love story of Cgristian and Ana
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS is one of the greatest television shows to date. I still havent decided if i like it or walking dead the best.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Really enjoyed the book - kept my interest all the way through.  Well written - lots of words to look up in the dictionary - but that was a &#34;learning experience.&#34;  I plan to read other books by Kate Morton.
1401238580|4.0|The item its all that is mentioned, but the box was a little damaged. I love everything that Moore writes and this is not an exception
B0087JTAKW|5.0|One of the better books I have read.  Have enjoyed other books by Mitch Albom.  Lots to &#34;chew on.&#34;  I would recommend it to any &#34;thinking&#34; person.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Simply one of the most bittersweet viewing experiences of my life. I had grown to love the crew and feel as if they were my friends and family, each new episode deepened that connection and this simply wonderful show helped me through some very dark times. To know that the crew finaly gets home fills me with joy, but knowing our journey together has ended casts a dark shadow on that delight. Voyager allows us to experience everything great that is trek, but also reminds us that we currently have nothing...
B000HSKUBE|5.0|Top quality actors and storyline. The networks don't have the courage or business vision to offer this type of miniseries.<br />Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright are Emmy contenders/winners for their work on this series.<br /><br />Placing the entire 13 episodes at once to be accessed at the convenience of the viewer is the future of TV programming. Technology has changed the world and with it the patience and commitment of the viewing public to entertainment. DVRs are being used to record an entire season of a show to be watched at a later date. Netflick is getting ahead of the curve and will be the pioneer in TV as Apple was with Itunes and music.<br /><br />When will the final 13 episodes be posted? Don't take to long as MAD MEN has done. You will lose the interest of your subscribers.
B000E5N62U|1.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Fagen and Steely Dan, but this is really a lackluster album.  Not much here to enjoy.
0987300911|5.0|\\"Target Band 7\\" by Simone Braverman is a very good book to prepare for the IELTS academic version. Although it doesn't include complete sample exams, I can really recommend buying it.<br /><br />The book mainly deals with strategies how to answer the different sections and question types (e.g. it introduces the structure of an essay or gives advice regarding the reading technique). Furthermore, there are plenty of tips how you should prepare (for example record yourself while answering sample speaking questions). As I said before, complete sample exams aren't included but for every single section of the IELTS sample questions are given. Unfortunately, not every question is followed by an answer but some questions are and others are answered on [...]<br /><br />All in all, I think it's a very good book and the supporting website is also worth being visited.<br />To be well-prepared I'd suggest combining \\"Target Band 7\\" with some original tests to practice the tips given, get familiar with the style and, of course, to receive a good score in the end.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I liked the reality of the show. This is what many people think really could happen to us. Many peaple believe the aleans was the beginning of man kind. So if they made us they can takes us too.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book, good finish to the Trilogy.  I think this has some flaws but overall it was worth reading during a recent spell of sickness.
B005ETANC2|4.0|While Mara Corday is the lead actress, and gives a good performance, I was interested to see where Clint Eastwood would appear.  His role as a jet pilot with only his eyes showing was even smaller than Corday's role some years in Eastwood's The Gauntlet.  Over all the film is a good example of the 1950s horror genre
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very useful and practical. I use it all the time as just looking at the battery indicator isn't enough.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Fringe is alot like Primeval and has lasted longer. The story is intellegent and believable. Science fiction is not well represented on television, but with shows like Fringe, hope abounds.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Better than the movie! The series was fun and exciting...looked forward to each new book. Read all three and am hoping for more!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I watched my friend play it before and it seemed really epic so I just had to get it. I couldn't wait!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exciting. Suspenseful. An easy read with all the elements of a great series. Love reading this on my Kindle. Would recommend to all my friends!
B001NKI60W|5.0|Wonderful singing and dancing. The cast was also amazing. I would recommend this to everyone young and older to  enjoy this wonderful musical.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|Love, love, loved this documentary on Bob Marley. What a handsome man with a heart so full of peace and love. I loved at the end when he said he doesn't have a goal and he just wants to see black, white, chinese,or whatever together living in peace. I wish he didn't die so young. He was and still is an inspiration to this world.
B009CPEOC4|3.0|Kind of boring at times, but I did enjoy the music parts of the documentary/movie. It was nice to see that she is a true person.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|I've seen this film 6-8 times and enjoyed it as much, perhaps more, the last time than I did the first. The score underlying the photography made it simply epic. But then, I love Celtic music anyway.<br /><br />The Scottish countryside was captured on film with lots of wide shots, giving the land a mystic quality.<br />Highly recommended if you can stand a little brutality in the realism of battle scenes.
1616550414|5.0|This is one magnificent book. My favorite game series spelled out in a beautiful book filled with game art and description of how the games came to be. If your love Zelda, you will love this book.
B007R0WHMK|1.0|This film should be released with a sternly worded warning about the graphic nature of the violence, particularly against women. It's a disturbing and overly long look inside the mind of an amoral young man with no guidance to develop any empathy.<br />Bone-chilling with no relief for its entire length.<br />I see no redeeming characteristics. I'm certain there will be those who disagree with this assessment but whoever does...well, I don't want to know them.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Stays true to the books but in the modern world. Works surprisingly well. Great acting, great story line, tons of mystery and enough action.
B0031RAOVY|3.0|This movie is well made but drags on and on.  While there were some cute scenes, I wanted more from the story.  I would like to have seen how the original story in Japan played out.
B005LAII1C|4.0|my husband really loved the movie.  This really isn't my kind of comedy but it's my husband's.  He loves the Simpsons and Family Guy so if you like those shows you'll love this movie.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Won't hardly move the pieces into place and won't rotate. That's very disappointing because the pictures are pretty and I was really looking forward to these jigsaw puzzles.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I always use this app as my go to weather center! I rely on this app more than any news channel.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a really fun game. I like the dark aspects of it really would encourage people that like hidden object games. Something different for a change not all that fairy stuff.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This gives me the opportunity to get all caught up with this show.  It's also nice to be able to download it and watch it any where, any time on my Kindle
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Imagine the heart break seeing the last of the series.  I love this show and sure am disappointed with only 5 seasons. Looking forward for more ideas by J Abrams.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This gives me the opportunity to get all caught up with this show.  It's also nice to be able to download it and watch it any where, any time on my Kindle
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I'm hooked on this series and now I find out it ended.  Break my heart.  I need more of these excellent TV shows that show absolute quality in ideas and production
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|The Screenplay was embarassingly bad.  We Almost turned it off (and in hindsight, should have).  Dont waste your time or money.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Now I finished this book, am now out of hell. Art must be looked at as an art. That's Mr. Mansons view, the same way I see it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book because it is different than my normal reading and it becomes interesting due to the change in format
0875428940|5.0|I have used the Robin Wood Tarot cards for about 15 years, and have gone through about 10 decks. They are my go-to deck for all my regular readings, and I teach from this deck. While the cards follow the images and essence of the Rider-Waite deck, Robin has given the cards more life, energy, expression, and has used a wider variety of color.
B0080SW3CC|5.0|The book Of Mice and Men is a great story by John Steinbeck. It reflects the period of time that it was written. This is a good book to share history through literature. A great feature of this book is its short length. This is effective for middle or high school students because they can read it in a relatively short amount of time.  Throughout the book, there are different terms used and occasional foul language that we see as inappropriate today.  Keep things like this in mind when selecting this book for a group of students.  The book gives several good examples in its overall theme that can contrast the world they lived in to our own world today. This book is a way to expose students to the past and help them to understand history in a different way.<br />  Within the first few pages, the author introduces the two main characters named George and Lennie.  Lennie's speech and actions depict that he had an Intellectual Disability. This disability is one of the 13 categories we classify today.  Many of the things we know today about mental disabilities did not exist during this time.  Steinbeck illustrates through his writing how Lennie grew physically into a man, but mentally he could not understand his own strength.  George cared for Lennie after his Aunt Clara passed away.  During this time, there was very little help for individuals with brain related disabilities.  Most were seen as dumb. There was often a constant struggle to live and find work. Many people with disabilities during this time did not make it out into the world because families were ashamed to have such a child seen in public.  George and Lennie went through many challenges to find Lennie a job. They made a goal to find a farm and to live off the land.  Lennie was fascinated in petting mice and rabbits and was a good friend to George.  The ending takes on a dramatic twist that you must read to find out.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read several other NDE related books and can say that this is a very interesting and thought provoking story.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This season has just completed on TV... Now I can watch the entire program all at once.... a Great way for a rainy or snowy day...  Who ever writes these programs, has a very unique imagination... BUT once again, it makes you THINK
B007X70NVO|5.0|A couple seasons old, but very good footage.<br />I have a new respect for Rossi.<br />If he can stay healthy, he just may become the greatest of all time (GOAT) for race wins.<br />Simoncelli is in here as well (RIP).
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I always like all the resident evil movies but this one is by far the worst! Way too fake and a very poor story! On top there was way to much computer graphics used. The movie is a total waste of money and time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome... really fun and addictive. Recommended for all ages<br />This game will not disappoint.. better the jungle run.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I like this show. It;s not awesome by any means but the story is good and its easy to get into.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There probably is a man (perhaps many men) who is as self-centered as Mr. Grey--given his wealth there can't be too many-- who would use Ms. Steele as described in the book.  Unfortunately, there are probably many women like Anastasia who feel so poorly about themselves that they would submit to a &#34;Mr. Grey.&#34;  Both, however, can only be seen as very sad individuals.  One can only hope that readers see the book as a good &#34;sex read&#34; (nothing new here; all of this material contained in other &#34;best sellers&#34;) not that they identify with either Grey or Steele.
B006TVQTHW|5.0|I don't usually rate things 5 stars unless they are close to perfection. This case is close to perfection. Plenty of room for fans and drives. The case is sturdy, has nifty cable management holes and has 2 places to mount SSDs without taking up any drive bays. The 5.25&#34; and 3.5&#34; bays are all tool-less installs. What more can one ask for? This case would be perfect if it had 4 external 5.25&#34; bays instead of 3.
B000W4B11G|2.0|This may be one of the worst movies ever made :)  But honestly, just to watch it for Jamie's performance.  She made a bad movie palatable.  If you love the 80's, you're going to like this movie.  It's not terribly bad, but it has its moments.  Yet it's not terribly good either.  If you like the stars, it will be fun and interesting to watch.  We've come a long way in film making.
0307463745|4.0|Jason and team,<br />Thank you for a great book and pleasant read. As I venture into starting my own business over the next few months this book has given me inspiration and guidance of how to build my company as well as confirmation that there are businesses out there with such ideals that have made it despite their unconventional thinking and simplistic approach.<br /><br />Thank you for sharing.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I have always loved Stephen King's books and this one is no exception. It is short but nail-bitingly scary and full of graphic gory details.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so much fun!!! even better that the first one!!!! love the tightrope part at the beggining!!! this game is awesome.
B001BANK32|5.0|I must say that I enjoyed this novel from the first page until the last. The scary parts were intense, gripping, and totally spine-tingling. I lapped them all up like a thirsty dog on a hot summer day. But what I really love about this book is the bond between father and son. I lost my dad when I was a young child and I could relate to the unquestioning and unwavering love for one's parent. This love will prevail over any adversary or darkness; and, in this superb novel, it was Danny's (and Jack's)  best weapon against the Overlook. I cried during the confrontation between father (who wasn't quite himself at this point) and son during the climax. It made me think of the sacrifices my own dad had made for me and my family. This novel by Stephen King is one of my all-time favorites!
B0088W8QSU|5.0|It is a shame they don't bring back SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis! Or at least another movie!! These shows are the best!
B00APJLX8E|5.0|The whole family enjoyed the movie and it was worth the money. My kids ended up watching it two more times before the rental was up.
B00821OX98|5.0|We've enjoyed this fast moving action adventure. Don't know how me missed it on the line up during the regular season! Now we're hoping there's a third season
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There are no words for how riveting and captivating this entire series has been...Mockingjay especially. I would and will read them over again and when my daughter is older, I'll read them to her.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time!  A must read if you are interested in transforming your life and learning about the other side of this one.;
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Can you possibly imagine that the son of the President of the United States would be a secret operative on foreign soil?  Neither can I.  The main plot of the &#34;Jack Ryan, Jr. books&#34; would be so much stronger if they had another character doing what &#34;Junior&#34; does with Junior in an important supporting role only in the United States.  Can you imagine the repercussions if the Son of the President were captured in a foreign nation after having conducted operations (spying, assassinations, etc.) against that nation?  Why would any intelligence agency or civilian intelligence outfit even take that chance?  They wouldn't.  Therein lies the problems with the Jack Ryan Junior novels.  They totally lack credibility.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Good reading, typically Baldacci.  Not his best but very engrossing & keeps you wanting to read more and find out the ending.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Well written with unexpected twists thoughout  the whole story ,quite entelligent and capture the ages of the main characters perfectly
B004LROUNG|3.0|Too slow & doesn't draw me in as his books usually do.  Hard to keep interested in the topic & characters
B007SGM084|5.0|Exquisite. I feel for each character as if I where there in the moment with them. I am wanting more.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|gary has been playing around austin for years---another fella now getting national recognition!  playing with the stones!  go gary go gary.....
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book keeps you guessing until the very end.  You realize at the end, you cannot easily assume anything about someone, and what makes them &#34;tick&#34;.
B00942G4UA|5.0|It is pretty amazing to see how our food production system has changed over the years and not for the better.  Factory farming may be able to produce tremendous amounts of what looks like food but it comes at a tremendous cost to our environment, our economy and most importantly to our health.  This is a good place to start if one wants to see how they need to change how they eat.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|its awesome.I would have been late for work with out that alarm clock. it is easy to set too. I love it so much
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Be warned - this movie is in the vein of other Wes Anderson movies.  It's very quirky and not for everyone.  But if you can get past that, the story is very sweet and funny.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|The Great Gatsby was a very good movie!  But then, it has to be because it has Robert Redford in it.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great season if you like the X files sci-fi kind if shows and it's a good way to keep you and your love one talking about the show.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful can't wait to buy the third and may I say so very clever and can I also say I would like to read the book in peetas perspective!!!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is an outstanding game, extremely well done for smaller screens. I'm on a first generation Kindle Fire, and this addictive game was completely worth the purchase price. I was disappointed that I finished it in one weekend. Looking forward to the sequel!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I especially like the zip line.  Also, I like the whole idea of the game and how it is put together.  Bravo.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Story development is too long, but once the first 45 minutes start time, the story goes well.  The special effects is a Spielberg specialty.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This thing was larger than life, priced better than right and I recieved it before I could say Thank you, so.. Thank you. 2 thumbs and 2 big toes way up! Oh and my son says thanx also. It was for his pc.
B008PZYZH6|4.0|Minimal use of special effects with the usual bang, boom and violence with a sub-plot of a bio-hazard dumping site masquerading as a high-tech disposal facility.  I consider this movie better than  National Treasure.
B005LAIH3G|4.0|John Carter (of Mars) is, with some 21st century tweaking, a fitting homage to the original E.R. Burroughs writings of a century past. Burroughs deserves credit as a forefather of modern day science fiction as many current day writers, filmmakers, even scientists cite his works as inspiration for their own creations.<br />The film was the box office success that would lead to an eventual franchise of sequels as was hoped and for a detailed analysis of that please read &#34;John Carter and the Gods of Hollywood&#34; by Michael D. Sellers.<br />With all of the Hollywood trappings of mis marketing, social media anti-hype, and a lack of appreciation or knowledge of the source material by the public at large, the film itself serves as a production that presents material that is as close as it could be in its attempt to tell the tale Burroughs penned so long ago.<br />The film is a special effects marvel, and the plot mechanizations and character interactions are serviceable to propelling the story along. If anything, the film is a difficult sell without being looked upon by avid scifi audiences as being derivative, even though it earns the rite by its place in literature as being the first of it kind in book form. One has to cast aside those notions and accept what i on the screen for that purpose in order to appreciate its accomplishments. Down the road, this will have been looked at as an opportunity lost, despite its 100 years in the making. In the meantime, give it a look. It is what it is and that's a good thing.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|i loved it full of action and great effects and great story line and if you have seen captain american movie , thor , hulk , iron man movies your definitely gonna love this piece ...
B0093ST02E|3.0|Beautiful, visually. Strange, deep look at a young woman's sense of self and relationships. Left me feeling thoughtful and a bit sad.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I love the whole 8th season with one exception - Amelia. If we could take out every scene with her in it then it would be perfect.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I love this rendition of the famous Sherlock Holmes. Everything about this series is smart. It is well written and acted. There is nothing I would change except to see them make more episodes sooner! What a season!
B008XKT9FG|4.0|Great scenery of Amalfi, a beautiful town on the coast in Italy.  Good story, a pleasant little film. Interesting plot and period costumes.
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this series! The individual stories are great and the ongoing story line throughout each episode is fantastic. The writers, Wow, job well done. The actors, perfect in and for their roles. The season finale, what a cliff hanger and yet so so fine. The only problem (that absolutely must be endured) is how long we have to wait for the next season. I'll just keep watching over and over what we have until then I guess! Ive become a big Sherlock Holmes fan thanks to this series, the movies, and now the TV show called Elementary too. All great in their own way. Can't get enough. Watch one while waiting for the other! Dear Sherlock, come back soon!
B009KHDT0C|2.0|The trailer for this movie looked really funny, but that was very misleading...the only funny parts were in the trailer and the rest of the movie was a snoozefest. It left a lot to be desired, the character development, plot, and ending all needed a bit of help and energy...basically, don't waste your money on this one, you will regret it!
030758836X|5.0|I couldn't 'turn the pages' any quicker (using an earlier version of Kindle)<br />I have not delighted in such fiendish writing in ages. The clever, CLEVER twists and totally \\"IN the head of the character's\\" writing was so captivating I embarrassingly admit to outbursts of emotes that even had my husband asking, \\"WHAT?!\\" and then me filling him in on the wickedness of this story. I can't retell like the Ms. Flynn wrote it, but 2nd hand, my husband was engrossed too.<br /><br />Brilliant, I think...this writing --about absolute insanity delivered in bursts of revelations about the 'truth' of the choices of each character---was done so by Flynn to keep us wondering from first chapter to last word...a 'WHATtheHELLisgoingON????' And then a \\"HOW sick is THAT person!\\"<br /><br />I read on IMBD it will be a movie...or it's been bought for such. I say, READ THIS FIRST. It will be a killer-flick, but NOTHING will do what your own head does while reading this.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />PS Now onto my 2nd choice by this author (\\"Gone\\" was  my first read of hers): \\"Dark Places\\" --Equally bizarre and delectable.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book gives insight on the world around us in a way I've never read before. This proves that miracles can still happen. Truly enlightening, and i feel it's a book you can get into.
B0081336FO|5.0|Another outstanding season, albeit one of their short, 3-episode seasons. Clever plots and good dialog. An excellent modernization of the Holmes saga without the Kung-fu fighting shown in the Robert Downey/Jude Law theatrical versions.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Nice quick week end read.  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!!!! I really like this author, will find and read more of her work.
B0040I09RM|4.0|I had not thought I would be interested when the show first came on the air & never watched it. After it had been on for a while I started to hear good reviews & since I could watch it on amazon I gave it a try.  I love being able  to watch it at my convenience & I enjoy the show very much.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Lots of tasks and things to keep you interested and keep things from getting stale. Great cut scenes, awesome art work, enough twists and turns to keep your attention.
1574216988|5.0|I am new to the concept zentangles but though the book is small it is an excellent resource I love all the tips and designs you get in this book I would certainly buy more of Sandy's books.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Really funerific and cool so so so so so so so good I like it a a a a a a lot
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Christopher Eccleston as the 9th Doctor is one of my favorites. It is a shame he only did one season.<br />Over all a solid season the worst episode being the 1st but I guess you needed to do some set-up.<br />By the 2nd episode it is off and running and you know you are in for a wild ride.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app has alot of cool stuf from my favorite game Minecraft, but the price I think should be lower.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|after i bought the gems from amazon the app wouldnt load any more after that. so that money i spent went down the drain. not happy!!!!!!
B0060AY85C|1.0|Tony Morrison exceeds herself in this novella, by attempting to use a literal googleplex of themes. Just about every paragraph contains some overly cryptic event that should somehow tie into some overarching theme.  It is excessive.  I would recommend reading since this seems to have become a topic of public conversation. But this is highly overrated.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this whole series very much and I was reading it thinking of some of the govts in our world and how it would be the young and courageous who can bring them out of oppressive govts.<br />An excellent finish to the series.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie of all time.  This was sent to me in a very quick manner and was perfect when it arrived.  Thanks so much!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I kept saying this to myself.. not great literature but Mommy Porn as my friends keep reminding me.<br />Titillating so it keeps your interest but not the best of novelists for sure.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|You have to love stories of the man who's afraid to fall in love and is completely swept off his feet before he knows realizes what has happened. A sweet and funny plot that takes us through that man's story.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am amazed at how Ms. Collins wove everything together into this exciting and interesting novel that is enjoyed by young and old as a well written story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Me I love the original temple run. Once this came out I got it. I think it's a lot better then the first. I like how you can go through the mines and the ziplineing at the begginng .The graphics are just like Wow. So if you like the first one I highly recommend this app.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is a great book.  I almost did not want to finish it as you know what is coming at the end.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Superb series.  Considering all of the attention given to Sherlock Holmes of late, I was pleasantly surprised by the entertaining quality of this series.  Bravo!
0394800184|5.0|... and a memorable story too. It makes me want to hunt down all the PD Eastman books. I love this style of children's book.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|Moving and informative highly recommend  both on the personal level of the characters and the historical aspect. Need to learn more about Biafra now
0064440346|5.0|Had it as a child and now bought it for my children. Easy to read and delightful for young ones.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I didn't know anything about this when I first turned it on.  It grabbed me, I haven't been able to turn it off.<br />The only regret is that it will end on the 100th episode.  If you like quirky science fiction, this has to be at the top of the list.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not figure out what would be good about the book when I heard what it was about. So of course, I had to read it. It got so much attention. At 6:30 in the morning, I had to make myself go to sleep. I did not want to stop reading! What a story. I did not want to like it, but I did. It kind of shocks you into wondering how low can we go? That the world in the story was North America is chilling. But it is a page turner. I will definitely read the rest of the series.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Without giving anything away, Rankin fans have John Rebus back - albeit as a civilian employee of the local cold case squad.  But he's back in all his glory; there is even a confrontation with Insp. Fox of internal affairs . . . Pick it up, you won't regret it!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this is so cool. 4 year old loves playing this app. She is laughing while playing it. I have played it when she isn't home.
B000GOVHN4|4.0|Movie was excellent and was available free on Prime.<br /><br />unfortunately, I was not able to watch the full movie because it is no longer available for free on Prime instant movie list
B00821PCJS|5.0|I was alittle reluctant to watch because of the alien theme but was excited to see that the show focuses on the characters more than the aliens. I think they did a terrific job in developing the many and diverse characters on the show. Can't wait for the new season to begin.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|This is a fast  browser that makes a lot of things easier to do on my kindle fire hd, want to load it on my 1st gen kindle also.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|As the trilogy went on it became very predictable. I m not saying I didn't enjoy the third book but it was not as exciting as the others . It wIll probably make a great movie.I
B00961ZESW|4.0|Really enjoyed listening to this one.  But I must say that the ulitmate was because it was $1.99 during the holiday season.  It is really good music too.
1423140605|5.0|I bought this for my son and he completed it in three days. Rick Riordan is his favorite author. The book arrived fast.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This author is wonderful!  I started the third book in the series this morning.  The story draws you in and is so exciting that you can't stop reading it.  Literally, my kindle running out of battery power is the only reason I've stopped reading today.  I loved the Twilight series and the Hunger Game series as well - so anyone that enjoyed those should also read this series.
B0030N3O8Y|4.0|You know what you get.. A very good end to a very good series! Wild definitely recommend to any one!
B000N6U0EC|4.0|Pretty good movie and story.  Great acting.  We don't watch it much, but it's a great hear-to-heart film.
B00942G4UA|5.0|I have always known for years that now the big corporations controlled the food supply, however, I didn't know that it was so few.<br />This film has made me take steps to support my local farmers , which I can at least in the summer. I hope to connect with farmers to provide during the winter months, i.e., grass fed beef, and the like. the Slaughter houses are horrible, the average person does not think twice how that meat got to the store. I buy organic when it is possible and put back anything with high fructose corn syrup back on the self, hopefully you will start making some buying choices as I have started doing.<br /><br />This Film will make you think twice on your next grocery visit, and hopefully help you make some wise choices.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|We had the full screen version, but really wanted the Blu-Ray version for such a good movie.  The kids love it.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Fabulous si fi drama! So well done, very deep thinking required. Boggles the mind that some of this is very loosely based in reality, or at least upon known scientific theory
B0060AY6FO|2.0|Ok, the fault is in my own lack of education in Great British Literature.  I simply could not get involved with this well written story that Baroness James always supplies us with and so will have to let it go, unappreciated.
B00APJLEGA|4.0|My 6 year old loved it. Watered down Sandler and Sandburg. I can also sit through it without wanting to jump off a bridge.
B00338QENI|4.0|The story here is told by Henrietta Lacks' family to Rebecca Skloot, a reporter.  It is  story of racism, questionable medical or scientific practice, and (perhaps)  the theft and commercial distribution of a woman's body part.  It is well written, well worth the time reading, and, with guidance, could be read by young adults and older students and other interested adults.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|You may want to consider all of these seasons.  No foul language and all of them them are easy on the eye to look at. Each season improves with the acting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|What happens to the patient when one is in a coma for a week?  This is the framework within much of this book's action happens.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Adele's voice is perfect for this production. It doesn't get any better than this.  The JAMES BOND THEME is her thing. Hopefully she will do more of them.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This is a very slow read.  Its rhythm, while slow, is pleasant.  I found it a pleasing book to read while we were having a blizzard and  I could enjoy it with multiple cups of (de-caf) coffee.  Like many of the Russian canon, this is not a book to be causally recommended as it is too long.  The brilliance of the choices made and acted upon in the Broadway version are remarkable.  I haven't seen the film, and will stay with the book for now.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Mockingjay book is well written as are all the other books in the Hunger Game series.  It kept the story  line and I thought a perfect way to end the series.
0345803485|1.0|The ingenue is seduced by the all-too-slick older man who pretends reluctance.  It's a story we've all heard before.  Here,however, there is nothing left to the imagination, and the details are tedious.  While this book may appeal to the prurient curiosity of its readers, I hope that it will be kept out of the hands of the young.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Works very well with my galaxy note 10.1. really is cool and i have no complaints so far. i think the app is pretty cool not only for saving video but also for making your favorite track or video on you tube into an audio file that will play in your normal android music player! nice app...... THANK YOU!!!!!!!
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|I watched the first season complete, and was hooked. I am now in the middle of the second season, and I still like the show, but I am beginning to wonder if I should not be rooting for the dead people.<br />  There is ALWAYS someone going off alone, either unarmed or not prepared!<br />  They always stop and camp in the middle of a forest, or right in the middle of a clump of destroyed cars, where it will be especially easy for dead people to just walk up to them!  How about next time you stop, it's in a K-Mart parking lot, where the dead people will have to walk 3/4 of a mile to get to you? .<br />  When they do go out on an expedition, they never carry more than 5 bullets, between ALL of them!<br />  Despite living in post apocalyptic America, they haven't bothered to stock up on guns, ammo, or gasoline, so they are perpetually on the edge of disaster, even though every city has 10 gun stores, and even Walmart carries ammo.<br />  Their vehicles are always breaking down, despite the fact that every car lot and RV lot in America would be filled with new, reliable vehicles, that they could just pick out and drive away in!  Why don't they stop in at La Mesa RV and drive away in a new diesel pusher, complete with washer, dryer, and full kitchen?<br />  They still have reservations about everyone being armed. It only takes a day of training and 500 rounds to become at least proficient, if not pretty good, at target shooting. And since the range they normally shoot at dead people is about 2 feet, it would be pretty hard for anyone to miss. EVERYONE should be carrying a gun, even the kids.<br />  It is also very difficult to believe that there are still herds of dead people wandering around. It would be very hard to convince me that groups of teenage boys would not be hunting them down on Saturday nights, drinking beer and making bets about who kills the youngest, oldest, cutest, and ugliest of the local group of dead people. Ya gotta have something to do on Saturday nights, and since Cable is off te air, I think walker hunting would be the new teen sport.<br />  So, in conclusion, although I love the show (The special effects are amazing) I have to start rolling my eyes at the Darwinian behavior of the people that are still alive.)<br />  But it's still fun to watch.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show is amazing. Funny with action and creativity abound with a little mixture of addiction thrown in because once you start you don't want to stop watching it!
B004OR1XGK|5.0|It's very wonderful how the book avoids a language oriented approach to coding and focuses on some very important heuristics which can be followed to improve quality of code.Definitely a must read for coders
B005PK56TA|2.0|I need someone in a show that I care what happens to them. Didn't like any of the principal characters. Wouldn't have really cared if everyone got chopped up.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Ok so this was so much better than book one, at first I thought this story was going to be a poor knock off of fifty shades (though i liked book 1 and gave it 4 stars)  it completely turns a corner. The issues between Eva and Gideon surface and it leaves me with anticipation for the next book. June is too far away to wait!
B007TK77QE|2.0|I was disappointed with the book  Slow moving and  tedious. Final chapters quite good but otherwise not a great read. I don't recommend it.
B000I52LUO|5.0|Christian Bale is terrific, as are the other actors in the film.  The suspenseful mood and heavy atmosphere of this movie is fantastic.  Thoroughly enjoyed watching this film.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book. Meant for teenagers, but adults can enjoy it too.  Quick to finish, so it is worth a look.
B002RTBN9O|4.0|Again, not as good as the book, but I understand Ayn Rand wrote the screenplay.  There are many underlying messages, so one needs to pay attention.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Just like the other two but all three are great.  Kids love it and it is good for the parents too.
B0094K1K42|3.0|I know too many people like this-almost making bad behavior and narcicism ok. Charlize Theron is underrated as an actress.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good movie and good book. It is a quick, entertaining read.  Meant for teenagers, but can easily be enjoyed by adults.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Not a Tom Cruise fan, but the MI series is always a winner. Never a dull moment- this movie never drags.
B00459GJUM|5.0|Highly entertaining sci fi.  Yes it borrows a lot from Battlestar Galactica, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and am disappointed that it was cancelled after only two seasons.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|Not as good as the book, but still a must-see.  Loved seeing location like Newport RI being used for Long Island.  Can't believe this came out almost 40 years ago.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|What a great show.  Successor to the x files.  I love the characters.  Good plot line with the occasional monster of the week episode.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There isn't much to say, it was a good read.  The story expands nicely and keep on going from book to book.
B0000844I8|5.0|Good movie. Cheap price for a good quality picture.  The whole Egyptian motif makes it unique sci fi, and is much of its appeal.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|challening and keeps the brain very active ,young and keeps the thinking hat on . is a great single game
B005LAIISA|5.0|My daughter loves this.  Good, fun film for the family.  Give it a try, or any in the series, couple of choices.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It's the type of book that had me wanting the conclusion to be exactly what it was. For everything that the main character had in his life and then to be left in his final condition, there could be no other ending.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Good movie.  Just like the other two but all three are good.  Kids love them and it is okay for the parents too.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. It kept you wanting to turn the pages faster.  The ending was unbelievable. Sad and happy at the same time.  Would recommend this book to anyone.
B005LAII62|2.0|My 3yo daughter thought it was boring and gave up half way through. Granted she really loves princess movies, but I thought I would give it a try.  Not so much.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It reminded me so much of Sleeping With the Enemy...The love story was sweet. Not going to add a spolier. But a certain twist was kind of interesting. Not bad. Not my all time favorite. That said I would recommend it. I could not put it down. Just too familiar with seeing the Julia Roberts Movie.
0757302661|5.0|Great book. I didn't make it all the way through before giving birth but the first half of the book made sense and helped me stay calm throughout my labor.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I wish there were different categories for these reviews...is it 5-stars like &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird?&#34; No, but it's a fun story, and a good read. I liked how the mystery was pieced together gradually, and liked all of the characters. I couldn't put it down once I started, so that's why I gave it 5 stars. Great literature? No, but a great read nonetheless.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series. This book is a great finish to a great series. I fell in love with book one and am even more in love at the end of book three.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app doesn't have a lot of buttons and whistles.  But that's why I like it. Any time I turn my Kindle on I click on it to see how much time I have left for various functions before I have to charge it. I would recommend that you go thru the initial set up so it will give accurate info for your device.
B00574PQDU|5.0|Not a run of the mill story. It was interesting from the get go and kept up the pace till the very end. It's always a pleasure watching Matt Damon.
B000T433CO|5.0|I bought this movie TWICE because the 1st one I bought broke when I was trying to get it out the case to watch it for the THIRD time.
B0088W6LAK|5.0|We watch the Stargate series through Amazon on Demand on our XBox. We enjoy no commercials and can watch episodes consecutively.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I been a Gilmore Girls fan for a very long time.  When I foudn this item on sale, I was so excited!  I received the item quickly but the casing is a bit fragile.  The discs keep wanting to fall out when I open it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|If you are still thinking about a book several days after you are finished reading it, you know it's good!
B005HED11Y|5.0|Awesome! I love the new touch ups on the effects. Would be a great show even if it just came out on tv today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is the funnest game ever you guys should get it me and my friend have already completed it it is sooooooooooooo cool
B004EPYZUS|3.0|The story line wasn't up to the same standard as the previous movies in the series but still worth seeing and owning.
B00914JWSW|4.0|I really enjoy listening to the tracks on this CD as it again shows the versatility of Streisand.  My favorite is the almost acoustic setting of &#34;With One More Look at You&#34; from Star is Born.  I still have my original Star is Born soundtrack album from the 70's.
B00003CXSM|3.0|We really liked this movie enough to buy it and watch it more than once.  It's sweet, a feelgood movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|was I the only one that was waiting for this??? it has great graphics and soooo much more challenging than temple run 1
B009LK6JS2|3.0|Needs controls, need to actually have some things to shoot at. There really no . Point to the game. Uninstalling
B004DSX5B6|5.0|This Knife will last a lifetime, feels solid and of quality. A good choice of tools, and made of good quality metal.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A very good story. An easy read. I think it could be enjoyed by young and older readers. Can't wait to see the movie.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|For the price the case is well worth it!  Should I need a case in the future I will certainly consider Marware as that was the only brand that was priced within reason.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is seminal in its research and presentation of vital differences between the natural born, biological, influences of introversion and extroversion.  It is a thoughtful explanation of many of the strengths and weaknesses of both and how both are necessary for our culture.  (Currently most of the West values extroversion while most of the East values introversion.  It is interesting as well how many Westerners are seeking Eastern &#34;religions&#34;!  Maybe they are hungry for acceptability of a blend of recognized dispositions too.))
B009CF3MEK|4.0|It was a little slow in parts and a little over acted, but in the end I was well entertained and enjoyed it very much. Feally appreciated the lack - I said LACK of over sexed and rotten language that is common in most new movies.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I didn't know about &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; until this year. My husband I started watching it and are &#34;hooked&#34;. We wanted to know what happened before this season, and were thrilled to find out we could get the first 2 seasons through Amazon! We watched several episodes a night until we were caught up. Thank you Amazon! Amazon Prime is so worth it!!
0452295548|5.0|Easy read that informs of the reality of being a stroke survivor.  I make all my students read this - so they can better care for their patients with head injuries.  Great to give families whose loved one suffered a stroke.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|I just threw away a buck on an identical program. How mis leading to change the name of an application, and pass it of as something new and better! I will never buy from this developer again, as I do not appreciate being mislead.<br /><br />This is EXACTLY the SAME program as Photo Editor +!!! If you own that don't buy this! All that has changed is the icons for the two applications. It gives you a blank page to scribble on. Can't do real art with shading. This is so wrong.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Awesome movie. Gotta see it! Eddie vedder nailed it! Very well written. Top five movies.the story line is gripping. Love this movie.
B000JIN3J8|3.0|I was looking for the newest version of Pride and Prejudice but I found only this 1980 version. Resolution was not so good. Why can't you give us the newest one?
B00A757EFW|4.0|I'm a pretty good classic Pac Man player and I have to admit this version is hard! I haven't gotten passed the 1st level. Very addicting since I'm on a mission to beat this game!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Makes you feel like piano lessons are easy. I don't know how to read notes but this one helped me a lot.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is really cute and a lot of fun, however it has been very glitchy. Sometimes I need to restart my Kindle Fire just to get passed the loading screen. It'll often tell me that the app can't be loaded and forwards me to the Amazon store. Every now and then it'll stop competitions before I get to the end and tell me it has ended. Other than glitches, definitely a 4 or 5 for a cute free game. I can only imagine it is due to being newly available to the Kindle Fire.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Easy to navigate and very convenient. Full of info. Hiwever, I suggest they should include an atlas or maps of the US.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lots of different things to do and keeps me from being bored all the time. Fun and is very realistic.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|works just fine and is convenient when the computer is acting up.  Sometimes it's just nice to take a quick peek at what is happening today.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it! Get this if you do not have it!<br />U will enjoy it for as long as u have it.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is a show based on REAL theoretical physics and REAL theories involving the possibilities of parallel universes and other scientific oddities that may exist with us at this very moment. I can't get enough of this show, it is most excellent!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|VERY LIFE CHANGING<br />A coming of age story that teaches one about being the person on the outside, I cried a lot while reading
B009E3EXMU|5.0|If you are a Zepplin fan this is a must have.  These guys are the kings of blues rock.  No disappointment in this buy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very much enjoying the ups and downs of this series.  Wonderful acting, beautiful scenery and costuming.  While many of the customs, taboos and traditions have changed in the 21st century, much of the angst of yesteryear continues even today.
